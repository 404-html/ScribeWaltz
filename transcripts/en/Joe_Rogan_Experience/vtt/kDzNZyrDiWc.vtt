00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.030
<v Speaker 1>And boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Danielle liberal friend here we go to </v>

2
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>the love and I am loving rather I should</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

3
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>your new podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history on fire.</v>

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>And it's just wonderful to hear your </v>
<v Speaker 1>soul tree Italian accent,</v>

5
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>a waxing politically on the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because,</v>

6
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just never learned to speak English.</v>

7
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you do speak.</v>

8
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>It's very confusing to me because you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak perfect English.</v>

9
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>You understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're very articulate.</v>

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Your choice of words is excellent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it comes out like,</v>

11
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.560
<v Speaker 1>how come I can do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can't do that.</v>

12
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Can you try to talk like me if you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it?</v>

13
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I think I do half of the time I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what accent?</v>

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

15
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I have a horrible year for racks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't tear it.</v>

16
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Don't hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

17
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>when I hear my recording that I go back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

18
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really speak like that.</v>

19
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bulky.</v>

20
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Right now you're in my own voicemail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

21
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.930
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no accident data is one of the </v>

22
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.031
<v Speaker 1>great things about doing a podcast is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it forces you to listen to your </v>

23
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:08.031
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can learn a lot about how you </v>

25
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.370
<v Speaker 1>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

26
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really can't.</v>

27
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.830
<v Speaker 1>You learn a lot about little things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do like,</v>

28
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.240
<v Speaker 1>like the word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like hats.</v>

29
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.100
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing people say like fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>way too off a lot.</v>

30
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>That's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That word like,</v>

31
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>like I've tried to shorten it or to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminate it,</v>

32
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:31.510
<v Speaker 1>but it fucking creeps its way in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's like this guy like it.</v>

34
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Some people in the problem is if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>fixate on it,</v>

35
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>if I fixate on someone saying it like </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it breaks me.</v>

36
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Then I have same thing I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some guy was really smart and </v>

37
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>really brilliant.</v>

38
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>They kept saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.780
<v Speaker 1>every four wards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I could not follow the conversation </v>

40
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>where he was making great points too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was missing out because they're </v>

41
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>psychos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

42
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

43
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.540
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go away.</v>

45
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a tech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets a,</v>

46
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a speech pattern.</v>

47
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker 1>It's basically a version of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] or A.</v>

48
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>I've always said that that's what people</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with the word fuck.</v>

49
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a use of the word fuck this fucking</v>

50
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>guy with this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking.</v>

51
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a filler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm super impressed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like Sam Harris that talk with no</v>

54
00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>filler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just just that on from.</v>

55
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My brain doesn't work like that.</v>

56
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm always scrambling for certain words </v>
<v Speaker 1>or trying to wonder if I was.</v>

57
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.630
<v Speaker 1>My vocabulary was better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I would be less likely to use </v>

58
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>fillers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I dunno.</v>

59
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>I think he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude in conversation sometimes you </v>

60
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>needed that Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll mess up big to just see,</v>

61
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do I want to go to wait to next?</v>

62
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:49.611
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to leave an awkward </v>

63
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:49.611
<v Speaker 1>pose a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like throwing something out there.</v>

64
00:02:49.611 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Just go through the dcs wherever you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go next.</v>

65
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Can you also don't want someone to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>jump in thinking you want them to talk </v>

66
00:02:57.451 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>and like you're in the middle of trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to form the sentence and if</v>

67
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 2>they do jump in then you'll totally lose</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

68
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.930
<v Speaker 2>So you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

69
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.390
<v Speaker 2>just to let them know I'm thing is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of just going,</v>

70

<v Speaker 2>I've had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.330
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that everybody at least painful that</v>

72
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.340
<v Speaker 2>way because you don't normally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you give a two and suppose between </v>

73
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 2>somebody starting in somebody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the next conversation,</v>

75
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:27.961
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's just there waiting for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to not stop but slow down so that they </v>

76
00:03:27.961 --> 00:03:30.910
<v Speaker 2>can jump in at that age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see people take a deep breath?</v>

77
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:35.911
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like Jesus mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's a full contact sport </v>

78
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 2>talking to somebody.</v>

<v Speaker 2>words to really say something that could</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been saving five,</v>

92
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's the vibe that you create that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

93
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's flowing.</v>

94
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like wine and poetry.</v>

95
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:18.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's got this sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas American is just like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's no,</v>

99
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 2>and I was starting to write in English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so damn hard for me because I was</v>

100
00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:35.870
<v Speaker 2>so used to these long flowy sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like De de,</v>

<v Speaker 2>de.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was these right?</v>

106
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.120
<v Speaker 2>Very musical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

107
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 2>any sentence that I would write like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in English,</v>

108
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 2>I lose half of the readers within three </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds because that's too many words.</v>

109
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Get to the point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

110
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:50.830
<v Speaker 2>what are you trying to say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like,</v>

111
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.610
<v Speaker 2>and I taught English sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no boy.</v>

112
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.430
<v Speaker 2>There's a reality that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

113
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.540
<v Speaker 2>there are ways to express yourself </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautifully,</v>

114
00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.800
<v Speaker 2>but it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to definitely toned down the </v>

115
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 2>line of the sentences a little shorter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are ways to do it,</v>

116
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 2>stealing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the way,</v>

117
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.270
<v Speaker 2>but he's completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the attention spans of people</v>

118
00:05:10.271 --> 00:05:12.740
<v Speaker 2>in Italy versus the people in America?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the,</v>

119
00:05:12.741 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 2>the Italian attention span seems to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>much longer.</v>

120
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.590
<v Speaker 2>There is some of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's still through a,</v>

121
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's a genetic thing or </v>
<v Speaker 2>not because I go to their back on </v>

122
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.471
<v Speaker 2>vacation so I don't have the pulse of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the situation anymore the way he used </v>

123
00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:28.471
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

124
00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:33.000
<v Speaker 2>he may be a generational thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was that way certainly when I was </v>

125
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.751
<v Speaker 2>growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was clearly more attention </v>

126
00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:36.751
<v Speaker 2>span.</v>

127
00:05:36.751 --> 00:05:39.480
<v Speaker 2>But then again that was before a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand sinks that we'll use to </v>

128
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.860
<v Speaker 2>distract ourselves time where it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody's sticking to you,</v>

129
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:42.540
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

130
00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:43.630
<v Speaker 2>let me send this email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

131
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

132
00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:44.890
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>

133
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:46.720
<v Speaker 2>But you're doing something else at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>

134
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

135
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:51.430
<v Speaker 2>but like a classical Italian meal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in a,</v>

136
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 2>in a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you would sit there for hours.</v>

137
00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like America where you're in </v>

138
00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.440
<v Speaker 2>and out in 40 now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

139
00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's much more of these as low pace </v>

140
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 2>and a creeping me out the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

141
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.580
<v Speaker 2>whole body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Marco's give me a call and within about </v>

142
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.050
<v Speaker 2>a minute I was sinking and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love ovarian,</v>

143
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 2>but the vibe for me was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

144
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

145
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's up now?</v>

146
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:20.741
<v Speaker 2>What do you want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized that he wasn't </v>

147
00:06:20.741 --> 00:06:20.741
<v Speaker 2>calling because he wanted anything.</v>

148
00:06:20.741 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 2>He just wanted to say what's up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>chat.</v>

149
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

150
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.570
<v Speaker 2>I forgot what it's like to be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nice.</v>

151
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:27.540
<v Speaker 2>I liked it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

152
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 2>that's a good feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

153
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:34.091
<v Speaker 2>Or You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just talking because we like to </v>

154
00:06:34.091 --> 00:06:34.091
<v Speaker 2>talk to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>

155
00:06:34.091 --> 00:06:34.340
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need something or you know,</v>

156
00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:39.341
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so used to that conversation now </v>

157
00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:42.611
<v Speaker 2>that everything is for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we're trying to get stuff </v>

158
00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:42.640
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

159
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.190
<v Speaker 2>it was so refreshing as feeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is beautiful.</v>

160
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.400
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I miss it.</v>

161
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:53.160
<v Speaker 2>That's how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nice if you can catch someone </v>

162
00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.450
<v Speaker 2>that's on the same vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're like,</v>

163
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:54.740
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just getting some shit done.</v>

166
00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.740

<v Speaker 2>So sometime that organic or relax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's hang out.</v>

173
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's things transpire and play half of </v>

174
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.050
<v Speaker 2>the time it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

175
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 2>it's known at one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to be out of here.</v>

176
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 2>This is my fun time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's 1215 motherfucker.</v>

177
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:32.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm not having fun yet making it fun </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now because I need to.</v>

178
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like you can do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was listening to this Ted talk on the </v>

179
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:42.110
<v Speaker 2>nature of happiness and I forget the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gentleman who was doing the speaking</v>

180
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.540
<v Speaker 2>but he was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he uh,</v>

181
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.170
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had developed an APP and in the APP,</v>

182
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would like hit you with reminders and</v>

183
00:07:51.501 --> 00:07:53.630
<v Speaker 2>ask you questions like what are you </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing right now?</v>

184
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Are you enjoying what you're doing right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now is just what you want to do?</v>

185
00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:02.290
<v Speaker 2>And like things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they would gather data and so </v>

186
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:05.850
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they added all their data from all the </v>

187
00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.421
<v Speaker 2>people that use the APP and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things they found was one of the least </v>

188
00:08:07.421 --> 00:08:07.430
<v Speaker 2>conducive things to happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the,</v>

189
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:12.431
<v Speaker 2>one of the indicators that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>not happy is when your mind is </v>

190
00:08:12.431 --> 00:08:13.940
<v Speaker 2>wandering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you just sitting around thinking of</v>

191
00:08:13.941 --> 00:08:15.890
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sitting and doing nothing.</v>

192
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.670
<v Speaker 2>And in those moments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

193
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.160
<v Speaker 2>people just don't feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

194
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:27.270
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their mind will wander to the negative </v>

195
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.770
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're in the moment and you're</v>

196
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:32.771
<v Speaker 2>occupied in something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're creating something or </v>

197
00:08:32.771 --> 00:08:32.771
<v Speaker 2>whether you're writing something or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you're doing,</v>

198
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.110
<v Speaker 2>like those are the moments where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>feel fulfilled and happy.</v>

199
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:38.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely in there something to be said</v>

200
00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:42.620
<v Speaker 2>for meditation in that regard of </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning to be in the moment when,</v>

201
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:47.650
<v Speaker 2>because you know a lot of the times we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be in the moment when we're doing </v>

202
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.591
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to be in the moment when you're not </v>

203
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:50.591
<v Speaker 2>doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

204
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:51.640
<v Speaker 2>let me take a deep breath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's be.</v>

205
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Or let's look around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not as easy to do as weird thing.</v>

206
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

207
00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:01.120
<v Speaker 3>That's why like our class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's a martial arts class or a </v>

208
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.081
<v Speaker 3>yoga class is really good for people </v>
<v Speaker 3>because someone's telling you what to </v>

209
00:09:05.081 --> 00:09:05.081
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

210
00:09:05.081 --> 00:09:09.491
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we're going to work on armbars from </v>

211
00:09:09.491 --> 00:09:09.491
<v Speaker 3>the mount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

212
00:09:09.491 --> 00:09:09.491
<v Speaker 3>I could get to the mount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

213
00:09:09.491 --> 00:09:13.721
<v Speaker 3>Shift your hips to the left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grab the arm pit and Diane and in going </v>

214
00:09:13.721 --> 00:09:17.141
<v Speaker 3>through those steps you have forced to </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on that thing and because </v>

215
00:09:17.141 --> 00:09:20.920
<v Speaker 3>it's so intense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're forced to be in that moment and </v>

216
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:24.940
<v Speaker 3>that for a lot of people is a real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not just the physical relief of </v>

217
00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:27.110
<v Speaker 3>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is fantastic for the mind,</v>

218
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:32.350
<v Speaker 3>but the relief of focus and </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentration alleviates a lot of the </v>

219
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:37.241
<v Speaker 3>bullshit that is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that builds up when the mind is </v>

220
00:09:37.241 --> 00:09:37.241
<v Speaker 3>wandering time.</v>

221
00:09:37.241 --> 00:09:42.020
<v Speaker 2>I notice when I do get to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I finally had a chance to start rolling </v>

222
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.850
<v Speaker 2>again the last month or two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's all fucking good.</v>

223
00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot.</v>

224
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Not only physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>

225
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:51.030
<v Speaker 2>I'll go to fields,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in that moment,</v>

226
00:09:51.031 --> 00:09:53.550
<v Speaker 2>you know if your mind wanders too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy's choking.</v>

227
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:55.350
<v Speaker 2>You guys aren't buying or you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>wander.</v>

228
00:09:55.351 --> 00:10:00.351
<v Speaker 2>You have to be totally present in what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing and he is just such a </v>

229
00:10:00.781 --> 00:10:05.781
<v Speaker 2>mental break that I thought I had all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these issues when I walk into class and </v>

230
00:10:05.781 --> 00:10:08.160
<v Speaker 2>I walk out of those problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you call it those problems.</v>

231
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 2>That's a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

232
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Big Deal because suddenly you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>lightened up.</v>

233
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:16.431
<v Speaker 2>You'll go read of this heavy load they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are carrying and there's nothing like </v>

234
00:10:16.431 --> 00:10:16.440
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

235
00:10:16.441 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 2>something that puts you in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also your body puts your body,</v>

236
00:10:20.041 --> 00:10:21.210
<v Speaker 2>your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

237
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.480
<v Speaker 2>The gift of perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

238
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some people get it from running,</v>

239
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

240
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:29.970
<v Speaker 2>I know some people they just love or </v>
<v Speaker 2>like running hills</v>

241
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:30.980
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

242
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:36.210
<v Speaker 3>because it's just so difficult and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>when when you reach the top of that </v>

243
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:36.580
<v Speaker 3>hill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a milestone,</v>

244
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:41.950
<v Speaker 3>you hit that milestone to get to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>hill and just whatever it is that effort</v>

245
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.070
<v Speaker 3>of doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is very intensive,</v>

246
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:49.080
<v Speaker 3>very difficult just when it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just everything else seems like relaxed </v>

247
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:51.990
<v Speaker 3>bake time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even weights.</v>

248
00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

249
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.390
<v Speaker 3>Anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

250
00:10:55.391 --> 00:10:57.940
<v Speaker 3>Just do something that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrate on.</v>

251
00:10:58.130 --> 00:10:59.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're lifting something heavy,</v>

252
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.800
<v Speaker 3>like if you're trying to bench press or </v>
<v Speaker 3>squat or something like that,</v>

253
00:11:02.801 --> 00:11:05.710
<v Speaker 3>like while you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is what you're concentrating on.</v>

254
00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:11.610
<v Speaker 3>Amazing though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's what the mind needs </v>

255
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.941
<v Speaker 3>sometimes just one primary singular </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing to focus on and to focus on an </v>

256
00:11:14.081 --> 00:11:16.210
<v Speaker 3>intensely and it's almost cleansing in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

257
00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.970
<v Speaker 3>Forces the pipes.</v>

258
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:24.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like when you have insects </v>

259
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.331
<v Speaker 2>for too long and then you'd wait that </v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly everything in your brain </v>

260
00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:27.430
<v Speaker 2>switches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

261
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:33.150
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit that I felt I had on me or </v>

262
00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.281
<v Speaker 2>this tension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff that I felt were real </v>

263
00:11:35.281 --> 00:11:37.501
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just haven't had sex for too many </v>

264
00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:37.630
<v Speaker 2>days in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Haven't had sex for a long time.</v>

265
00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were saying you've had sex</v>

266
00:11:39.791 --> 00:11:44.791
<v Speaker 2>for too long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like know such and such a thing as</v>

267
00:11:45.791 --> 00:11:48.800
<v Speaker 2>doing some sessions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some session work Myra.</v>

268
00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's good.</v>

269
00:11:51.791 --> 00:11:52.930
<v Speaker 2>Fuck people up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

270
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

271
00:11:53.551 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

272
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 1>to this day think that that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for men,</v>

273
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.360
<v Speaker 1>the primary reason why a lot of men </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhibit like really pathetic behavior </v>

274
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:09.690
<v Speaker 1>because they are trying so hard to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>women to like them and nothing is </v>

275
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.741
<v Speaker 1>working and so they have fallen into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this trap of becoming this like she male</v>

276
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:17.770
<v Speaker 1>thing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this like super feminist,</v>

277
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:23.040
<v Speaker 1>sort of always a identifying with </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's issues and trying to get women </v>

278
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:25.930
<v Speaker 1>on your side and it doesn't fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

279
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:27.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dave Rubin,</v>

280
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:29.440
<v Speaker 1>a guy was on the podcast the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

281
00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:30.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

282
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 1>great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great podcast.</v>

283
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:37.201
<v Speaker 1>Had a great time with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he tweeted something the other day </v>

284
00:12:37.201 --> 00:12:39.190
<v Speaker 1>and it was a billboard that some poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>fool had put up and it said,</v>

285
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.430
<v Speaker 1>dear women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on behalf of all men,</v>

286
00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's right.</v>

287
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.540
<v Speaker 1>That the ps two died would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really trying to get laid,</v>

288
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 1>really trying so hard at me with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>touched my deck.</v>

289
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>police.</v>

290
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.670
<v Speaker 1>That would have been more honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to just put that on the </v>

291
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.670
<v Speaker 1>billboard is like with the number at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ad is like,</v>

292
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor guy.</v>

293
00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

294
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that there's anything wrong with </v>

295
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:09.660
<v Speaker 1>siding with women if you agree that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd been fucked over or looking at </v>

296
00:13:10.751 --> 00:13:14.920
<v Speaker 1>for them out for them or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sympathizing or empathizing.</v>

297
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:18.050
<v Speaker 1>That's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the behavior.</v>

298
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.190
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also an anti masculine behavior</v>

299
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:25.270
<v Speaker 1>and anti male behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because they identify,</v>

300
00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:30.420
<v Speaker 1>they identify those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those characteristics with bullies or </v>

301
00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.290
<v Speaker 1>people that were mean to them or people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

302
00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.140
<v Speaker 1>caused them pain or frustration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also like this.</v>

303
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.540
<v Speaker 1>It's traitorous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

304
00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:42.541
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're a gender traitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in some ways to me there's that </v>

305
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:47.580
<v Speaker 1>bullshit dichotomy there where you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the strong natural asshole that was </v>

306
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.360
<v Speaker 1>older soul kind of doesn't care about </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody's feeling.</v>

307
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Some days by your strong that's the good</v>
<v Speaker 1>side or use to sweet little sensitive,</v>

308
00:13:56.891 --> 00:14:01.891
<v Speaker 1>but if you say you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi Dina color and I run and he's like </v>

309
00:14:01.891 --> 00:14:04.740
<v Speaker 1>both them all data suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither one is a desirable way to beat </v>

310
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.000
<v Speaker 1>you in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that in trying to get rid</v>

311
00:14:07.001 --> 00:14:12.001
<v Speaker 1>of the acid male side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have also gotten rid of the </v>

312
00:14:12.001 --> 00:14:12.910
<v Speaker 1>good stuff about being a man about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

313
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:13.800
<v Speaker 1>that it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be a nation,</v>

314
00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:15.820
<v Speaker 1>the stereotypical masculine quality and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

315
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.860
<v Speaker 1>that's not what we're trying to get rid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

316
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.480
<v Speaker 1>That's the good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to keep that.</v>

317
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.840
<v Speaker 1>You want to get rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the 79.</v>

318
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.960
<v Speaker 1>It's gender role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the man I was lucky around and go </v>

319
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:27.960
<v Speaker 1>back into the kitchen kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

320
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.960
<v Speaker 1>I can see how that would be less than </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>

321
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:34.410
<v Speaker 1>but they get the lead off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean get rid of the good </v>

322
00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:35.890
<v Speaker 1>stuff at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly the term.</v>

323
00:14:35.891 --> 00:14:38.530
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard the term toxic toxic </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculinity?</v>

324
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.890
<v Speaker 1>That's an adorable term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like social justice warriors or </v>

325
00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.311
<v Speaker 1>throw around toxic masculinity and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>real problem with men adopting this idea</v>

326
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 1>is that they ignore the negative things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that women have</v>

327
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.920
<v Speaker 3>done because it's not about women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about men.</v>

328
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.770
<v Speaker 3>It's about nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really what it is.</v>

329
00:14:57.771 --> 00:15:02.771
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's feminine qualities that </v>
<v Speaker 3>are beautiful and there's male masculine</v>

330
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:04.100
<v Speaker 3>qualities that are beautiful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

331
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:09.430
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people on both sides that are </v>

332
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.951
<v Speaker 3>out of their fucking mind and bat shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy and to side with women on every </v>

333
00:15:11.951 --> 00:15:12.890
<v Speaker 3>occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just because you're a man,</v>

334
00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:14.700
<v Speaker 3>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry for all men before we.</v>

335
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:17.630
<v Speaker 3>And my apologies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's weak shit.</v>

336
00:15:17.631 --> 00:15:19.280
<v Speaker 3>You know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to run hills,</v>

337
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to go to class,</v>

338
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:26.650
<v Speaker 3>take a yoga class to something but </v>
<v Speaker 3>hadn't gotten laid or get someone to </v>

339
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:26.650
<v Speaker 3>touch you.</v>

340
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:28.940
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny cause when you don't come</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a place of need,</v>

341
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:33.260
<v Speaker 2>suddenly we may like you paying times as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much as before.</v>

342
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:38.060
<v Speaker 2>There was a period where I did not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't running anymore on the typical</v>

343
00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:40.130
<v Speaker 2>script that I've had for most of my life</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's like,</v>

344
00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want your attention.</v>

345
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Look at that one time thing for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

346
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:50.470
<v Speaker 2>there was a period where seeing sap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but either way where I didn't care.</v>

347
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we haven't got.</v>

348
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:53.930
<v Speaker 2>I haven't got with [inaudible] I'm happy</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

349
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.800
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

350
00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.120
<v Speaker 2>you are beautiful lawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great,</v>

351
00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:58.350
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want anything from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course the second,</v>

352
00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:03.370
<v Speaker 2>but my brain switched awake suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 2>been like 10 times more than before and </v>

353
00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:03.600
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

354
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:05.330
<v Speaker 2>that works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing,</v>

355
00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:06.260
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

356
00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:11.650
<v Speaker 2>but there's something about being </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable in your own skin and just </v>

357
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.701
<v Speaker 2>know constantly acting because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to impress somebody or you want </v>

358
00:16:15.701 --> 00:16:17.570
<v Speaker 2>somebody to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's sex,</v>

359
00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:19.940
<v Speaker 2>whether it is attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether whatever that may be because you</v>

360
00:16:19.941 --> 00:16:21.470
<v Speaker 2>want something from them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

361
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.680
<v Speaker 2>this is why I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You dig it.</v>

362
00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:24.600
<v Speaker 2>You dig it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

363
00:16:24.601 --> 00:16:27.320
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still comfortable with who I am.</v>

364
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.530
<v Speaker 2>It makes such a difference when people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether today too.</v>

365
00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.660
<v Speaker 3>I think also the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless of the words that you choose </v>

366
00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.620
<v Speaker 3>and the way that you say them in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sentences that you structure,</v>

367
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.920
<v Speaker 3>I think people can feel intent and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can just something about it.</v>

368
00:16:43.111 --> 00:16:48.111
<v Speaker 3>There's an intangible quality to a needy</v>
<v Speaker 3>person that even if they do say the </v>

369
00:16:48.111 --> 00:16:49.290
<v Speaker 3>right things and do it in the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>order,</v>

370
00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:53.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some women or some manner like fucking,</v>

371
00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:54.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not this,</v>

372
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:59.180
<v Speaker 3>not this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you can read all the books </v>

373
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.510
<v Speaker 3>into wired about the stuff you say.</v>

374
00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.710
<v Speaker 2>That's barely half of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

375
00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:06.860
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's who you are is not what you say,</v>

376
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.050
<v Speaker 2>what the image you put.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even because it's painful,</v>

377
00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:14.051
<v Speaker 2>you have to constantly keep up this </v>
<v Speaker 2>image that's not reading you and you </v>

378
00:17:14.051 --> 00:17:15.540
<v Speaker 2>have to say all the right thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I say short?</v>

379
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:15.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or towards</v>

380
00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:20.690
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever paid attention at all to </v>

381
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:20.690
<v Speaker 3>pick up artists?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

382
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.190
<v Speaker 3>and pickup artist game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

383
00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:23.960
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll just.</v>

384
00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:28.970
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen some videos online where </v>

385
00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:31.671
<v Speaker 3>they're actually critiquing people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>approaches and strategies for getting </v>

386
00:17:31.671 --> 00:17:36.261
<v Speaker 3>women to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like videos on it where a guy </v>

387
00:17:36.261 --> 00:17:39.111
<v Speaker 3>will have a hidden camera and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to a girl and then the guys in the </v>

388
00:17:39.111 --> 00:17:41.610
<v Speaker 3>comments will be like interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like opening great game.</v>

389
00:17:41.611 --> 00:17:46.611
<v Speaker 3>I like how he's doing this like they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have like like moves like it's talking </v>

390
00:17:46.611 --> 00:17:48.180
<v Speaker 3>about like Jujitsu or something or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way you lean to the right.</v>

391
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.150
<v Speaker 3>Talking to where that call</v>

392
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.030
<v Speaker 1>that's like too much but it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's crazy about it.</v>

393
00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:57.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess it will work on some </v>
<v Speaker 1>really fucking dumb girls.</v>

394
00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:02.410
<v Speaker 1>That's how it girls will find out like </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep into a relationship like months </v>

395
00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:05.470
<v Speaker 1>later that the guys like heavily in debt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wanted by the FBI and you know,</v>

396
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.500
<v Speaker 1>beats his mom like you don't find find </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit out because he got tricked you</v>

397
00:18:10.501 --> 00:18:14.100
<v Speaker 1>with all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this strategy and if you can't read that</v>

398
00:18:14.101 --> 00:18:16.260
<v Speaker 1>then you're not going to know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something's going on.</v>

399
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:21.440
<v Speaker 1>But that to me is if you ever really bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radar and you can get out of people,</v>

400
00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:25.200
<v Speaker 1>then you are dependent on what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are bad radar,</v>

401
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.010
<v Speaker 1>but what they say is a smoke screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

402
00:18:27.011 --> 00:18:30.300
<v Speaker 1>and they say maybe real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe in all its people put on a show at</v>

403
00:18:30.301 --> 00:18:32.100
<v Speaker 1>the time and to me it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

404
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:36.180
<v Speaker 1>You didn't feel sitting next to the guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 35 cycles that that guy's a freak or</v>

405
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.440
<v Speaker 1>a woman is evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or man,</v>

406
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.270
<v Speaker 1>you feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what they say.</v>

407
00:18:40.271 --> 00:18:42.750
<v Speaker 1>It's but it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to have sovereignty.</v>

408
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:48.290
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to have personal sovereignty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to be at a place where you </v>

409
00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:51.110
<v Speaker 1>don't need anybody or you're not needy </v>
<v Speaker 1>or when you're around a beautiful girl,</v>

410
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.130
<v Speaker 1>you don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's hard,</v>

411
00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:54.300
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

412
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:59.301
<v Speaker 1>Most men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say like 99 percent of men when </v>

413
00:18:59.301 --> 00:19:02.700
<v Speaker 1>they're around a really beautiful girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just panic.</v>

414
00:19:02.701 --> 00:19:07.701
<v Speaker 1>They start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if there's no chance that girl's </v>

415
00:19:07.701 --> 00:19:07.701
<v Speaker 1>gonna fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're your behavior alters.</v>

416
00:19:07.701 --> 00:19:12.501
<v Speaker 1>It gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My solution to it's illegal in 49 and a </v>

417
00:19:12.501 --> 00:19:16.341
<v Speaker 1>half state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that going toward the nine </v>

418
00:19:16.341 --> 00:19:17.850
<v Speaker 1>and a half because it's legally in rural</v>
<v Speaker 1>counties in Nevada,</v>

419
00:19:17.851 --> 00:19:20.360
<v Speaker 1>but going tweens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sanely halt,</v>

420
00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:25.410
<v Speaker 1>who curse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calm people down for immense them point </v>

421
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:25.410
<v Speaker 1>would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

422
00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:28.960
<v Speaker 1>if I want to get laid with seemingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>hall tool when I can mind Nicole,</v>

423
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.760
<v Speaker 1>you are nice to them.</v>

424
00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.190
<v Speaker 1>They're nice to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>done so if you do that,</v>

425
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:35.160
<v Speaker 1>then in the back of your brain is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>like every time you see a hot woman,</v>

426
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.840
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want these as I couldn't.</v>

427
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.030
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get these any other time in </v>
<v Speaker 1>another way.</v>

428
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.490
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a game and you've kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>got lady now other ways.</v>

429
00:19:41.491 --> 00:19:43.590
<v Speaker 1>At least you'll go to the nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly,</v>

430
00:19:43.591 --> 00:19:45.040
<v Speaker 1>who'll courage you've got laid out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

431
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then women don't immediately trigger,</v>

432
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.570
<v Speaker 1>I need something from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like another hot woman.</v>

433
00:19:51.571 --> 00:19:53.900
<v Speaker 1>I was having sex with a woman yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what do you know?</v>

434
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.810
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have that same pressure with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that might.</v>

435
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:03.250
<v Speaker 1>I have a vague feeling that I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get a TV program on a doctor </v>

436
00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:03.550
<v Speaker 1>feel recommended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go to Ku.</v>

437
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Kersey make their life better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's my thing.</v>

438
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you right now.</v>

439
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:13.250
<v Speaker 1>That is the wrong approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ain't about the woman being hot.</v>

440
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.470
<v Speaker 1>It's about love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serve.</v>

441
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Sorry to buy your right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll just throw by my ankle.</v>

442
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Your balls will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll rot if you hear that long </v>

443
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.831
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they get angry and they fall right </v>

444
00:20:27.831 --> 00:20:27.831
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

445
00:20:27.831 --> 00:20:30.741
<v Speaker 1>I think that the idea of going to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hooker in America is disgusting idea.</v>

446
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Like that's how we look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as our culture,</v>

447
00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:39.320
<v Speaker 1>our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our culture looks at prostitution is </v>

448
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:39.960
<v Speaker 1>something foul and you and I both have </v>
<v Speaker 1>daughters.</v>

449
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:41.910
<v Speaker 1>We don't want our daughters to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>prostitutes,</v>

450
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:46.770
<v Speaker 1>but if you know somebody else's daughter</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to do it.</v>

451
00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.420
<v Speaker 3>So you are son.</v>

452
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:58.020
<v Speaker 2>There are cases where somebody become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole car because they are life socks </v>

453
00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:58.780
<v Speaker 2>and they are on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are decent.</v>

454
00:20:58.781 --> 00:20:59.800
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's clearly not.</v>

455
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.770
<v Speaker 2>But I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know a women who have,</v>

456
00:21:02.771 --> 00:21:07.771
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who need to become sex workers who are </v>

457
00:21:07.771 --> 00:21:08.920
<v Speaker 2>speak multiple languages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Graduated from Ucla,</v>

458
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.660
<v Speaker 2>they have jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have money,</v>

459
00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:15.661
<v Speaker 2>they have stuck in their ways a day you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the power and the exchange because </v>

460
00:21:15.661 --> 00:21:19.741
<v Speaker 2>the way they are going to play it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they couldn't see their kind of </v>

461
00:21:19.741 --> 00:21:19.741
<v Speaker 2>like dating except that Ip can my </v>
<v Speaker 2>clients.</v>

462
00:21:19.741 --> 00:21:24.190
<v Speaker 2>And so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm leaping around a lot but I get paid </v>

463
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.870
<v Speaker 2>bank for doing that and that's a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>different kind of,</v>

464
00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:27.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not all.</v>

465
00:21:27.581 --> 00:21:32.581
<v Speaker 2>Prostitution is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole different game that </v>

466
00:21:32.581 --> 00:21:33.070
<v Speaker 2>somebody will come through acquisition </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they are empowered reatard and the</v>

467
00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:36.040
<v Speaker 2>typical street hooker kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a whole different game.</v>

468
00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met girls that have done that,</v>

469
00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:44.650
<v Speaker 3>that have actually like had like wealthy</v>
<v Speaker 3>men that they've had sex with and then </v>

470
00:21:44.931 --> 00:21:46.520
<v Speaker 3>they only had like a few of them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

471
00:21:46.521 --> 00:21:51.521
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fucked him like a couple times a </v>

472
00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:51.521
<v Speaker 3>month and that was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was how they made all their money.</v>

473
00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they but they didn't like take other</v>

474
00:21:52.971 --> 00:21:55.760
<v Speaker 3>clients on and I was like that is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>

475
00:21:55.761 --> 00:21:56.510
<v Speaker 3>That is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

476
00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:01.750
<v Speaker 3>but why is it weird?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when you look at like a really </v>

477
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.310
<v Speaker 3>hot woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Donald Sterling situation,</v>

478
00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:09.470
<v Speaker 3>that old troll looking raised in man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had that girl that,</v>

479
00:22:09.471 --> 00:22:14.471
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one that ratted them out and made </v>

480
00:22:14.471 --> 00:22:14.471
<v Speaker 3>those recordings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was hot.</v>

481
00:22:14.471 --> 00:22:16.990
<v Speaker 3>She was young and hot with a nice body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what do,</v>

482
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:22.020
<v Speaker 3>what do we think is going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do we think he bought her a </v>

483
00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.970
<v Speaker 3>multimillion dollar condo and a Bentley </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all that.</v>

484
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:27.470
<v Speaker 3>Why is it okay to just by people so you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can exchange gold coins.</v>

485
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.750
<v Speaker 3>Can you exchange gold coins is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>paper.</v>

486
00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.360
<v Speaker 3>I work Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you buy someone a house?</v>

487
00:22:32.361 --> 00:22:35.360
<v Speaker 3>You just can't give them cash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get weird.</v>

488
00:22:35.361 --> 00:22:39.500
<v Speaker 3>Like why is the exchange?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when the exchange is actual money,</v>

489
00:22:39.501 --> 00:22:40.970
<v Speaker 3>not something that you can convert to </v>
<v Speaker 3>money,</v>

490
00:22:40.971 --> 00:22:43.250
<v Speaker 3>but the actual money itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes an issue.</v>

491
00:22:43.251 --> 00:22:47.300
<v Speaker 3>Like prostitution exists across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>board in many,</v>

492
00:22:47.301 --> 00:22:52.301
<v Speaker 3>many relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have friends that are married to </v>

493
00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:52.301
<v Speaker 3>prostitutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They really are.</v>

494
00:22:52.301 --> 00:22:57.010
<v Speaker 3>They just happened to be monogamous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also that they're monogamous </v>

495
00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.891
<v Speaker 3>prostitutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these guys are wealthy guys and </v>

496
00:22:59.891 --> 00:23:00.950
<v Speaker 3>there's these women that they're dating </v>
<v Speaker 3>really don't even particularly like them</v>

497
00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.050
<v Speaker 3>and they have to buy them things all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

498
00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:08.060
<v Speaker 3>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to constantly keep the fires </v>

499
00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:08.060
<v Speaker 3>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

500
00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.880
<v Speaker 3>this style of relationship lit that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>find weird is like easy,</v>

501
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.200
<v Speaker 3>easier to just pay for echolook are </v>
<v Speaker 3>gold.</v>

502
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.200
<v Speaker 3>They are each tie but those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then,</v>

503
00:23:15.201 --> 00:23:20.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is people want </v>

504
00:23:20.201 --> 00:23:20.201
<v Speaker 3>companionship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want someone to be there for them.</v>

505
00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.640
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to get the by paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody for that.</v>

506
00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.220
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

507
00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.820
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like saying it can never work.</v>

508
00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:34.370
<v Speaker 3>I just think that a lot of people would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be way better off a lot of people if sex</v>

509
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.080
<v Speaker 3>wasn't such a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

510
00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.320
<v Speaker 3>And I think that is a big part of what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

511
00:23:40.321 --> 00:23:44.300
<v Speaker 3>Like part of what's going on with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with campuses,</v>

512
00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were there,</v>

513
00:23:45.981 --> 00:23:50.981
<v Speaker 3>they have this massive amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention that's being paid to sexual </v>

514
00:23:50.981 --> 00:23:53.510
<v Speaker 3>assault is very good in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But your sexual assault,</v>

515
00:23:53.511 --> 00:23:56.870
<v Speaker 3>actual real sexual assault is horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking that's disgusting.</v>

516
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.800
<v Speaker 3>It's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

517
00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:03.160
<v Speaker 3>the idea that my son could do it or that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could have done it when I was young as</v>

518
00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.300
<v Speaker 3>it's terrifying to me and disgusting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

519
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.960
<v Speaker 3>but equally equally true.</v>

520
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:14.020
<v Speaker 3>The idea of someone being accused of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual assault where it really was just </v>

521
00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.050
<v Speaker 3>regret that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

522
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:20.290
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that are trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to say that if two people get drunk and </v>

523
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:25.101
<v Speaker 3>they have sex and then somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 3>another that rape and it's just people </v>

524
00:24:25.101 --> 00:24:27.200
<v Speaker 3>having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no violence,</v>

525
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.330
<v Speaker 3>there's no forcing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

526
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.730
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy talk.</v>

527
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:37.060
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of that comes from the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these puritanical ideas that sex is </v>

528
00:24:37.611 --> 00:24:42.611
<v Speaker 3>somehow a bad thing because if two </v>
<v Speaker 3>people got together and they got drunk </v>

529
00:24:42.611 --> 00:24:43.040
<v Speaker 3>and just cuddled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one gives a shit.</v>

530
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>

531
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.960
<v Speaker 3>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where does it end?</v>

532
00:24:47.961 --> 00:24:48.620
<v Speaker 3>Like he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

533
00:24:48.621 --> 00:24:52.880
<v Speaker 3>what if you just cuddle and you both </v>
<v Speaker 3>have shorts on and a t shirt and the guy</v>

534
00:24:52.881 --> 00:24:54.410
<v Speaker 3>gets a boner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what happens there?</v>

535
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:55.940
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that bad?</v>

536
00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:01.160
<v Speaker 3>Like what if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if you're cuddling and the guy and </v>

537
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.450
<v Speaker 3>the girl don't have shirts on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have their pants on,</v>

538
00:25:02.451 --> 00:25:04.130
<v Speaker 3>like what the fuck are we doing?</v>

539
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they're drunk and they hug everyone's</v>

540
00:25:07.581 --> 00:25:09.710
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if they're drunk and they fuck,</v>

541
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:11.240
<v Speaker 3>it's a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

542
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:11.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

543
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.470
<v Speaker 3>if someone says no and the other person </v>
<v Speaker 3>forces them or does it,</v>

544
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:20.500
<v Speaker 3>then the problem is of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if it's just two people that drink </v>

545
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.190
<v Speaker 3>and then do something in the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>person wakes up in the morning,</v>

546
00:25:22.191 --> 00:25:22.930
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe it.</v>

547
00:25:22.931 --> 00:25:25.730
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that Guy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then their friends,</v>

548
00:25:25.731 --> 00:25:30.731
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were you drunk when you could not </v>

549
00:25:30.731 --> 00:25:30.731
<v Speaker 3>consent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is rape.</v>

550
00:25:30.731 --> 00:25:31.080
<v Speaker 3>It's not rape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was drunk too,</v>

551
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was uh,</v>

552
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.430
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

553
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:38.120
<v Speaker 3>I forget what the protest was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these guys had these signs that said</v>

554
00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:42.790
<v Speaker 3>regret is not rape and there was this </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking terrible backlash this.</v>

555
00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.470
<v Speaker 3>But that is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is regret.</v>

556
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.910
<v Speaker 3>Whatever happened to fucking up would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have ever happened to making mistakes.</v>

557
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:55.120
<v Speaker 3>And also why is it that one gender gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>a g get out of jail free card,</v>

558
00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:59.360
<v Speaker 3>like you got raped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas every guy that I've ever met has</v>

559
00:25:59.361 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 3>gotten drunk and had sex with someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they regretted.</v>

560
00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:04.070
<v Speaker 3>And then after it's over the like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus Christ,</v>

561
00:26:04.071 --> 00:26:06.140
<v Speaker 3>what did I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

562
00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.510
<v Speaker 3>And then the girls calling you or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

563
00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:10.870
<v Speaker 3>you see her again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

564
00:26:10.871 --> 00:26:15.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody think of it that the guy got </v>

565
00:26:15.871 --> 00:26:15.871
<v Speaker 3>raped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

566
00:26:15.871 --> 00:26:15.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guy himself,</v>

567
00:26:15.871 --> 00:26:20.051
<v Speaker 3>he's not going to think that a woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>would think that if a woman got drunk </v>

568
00:26:20.051 --> 00:26:24.161
<v Speaker 3>with a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then of course you get into this </v>

569
00:26:24.161 --> 00:26:27.551
<v Speaker 3>bill cosby territory where a guy is </v>
<v Speaker 3>purposely getting someone drunk or </v>

570
00:26:27.801 --> 00:26:29.990
<v Speaker 3>purpose of getting someone fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

571
00:26:29.991 --> 00:26:31.820
<v Speaker 3>of course that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where it gets weird,</v>

572
00:26:31.821 --> 00:26:32.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

573
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.620
<v Speaker 3>that's where it all turns into an actual</v>
<v Speaker 3>crime or an actual,</v>

574
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:38.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

575
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:43.110
<v Speaker 3>a negative interaction or verifiable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bonafide</v>

576
00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:44.890
<v Speaker 1>assault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

577
00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:49.740
<v Speaker 1>That's different even as the intent is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different thing to another.</v>

578
00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:50.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

579
00:26:50.401 --> 00:26:55.401
<v Speaker 1>That's one story that that one is I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get you to a vulnerable </v>

580
00:26:55.401 --> 00:26:58.911
<v Speaker 1>position because I want to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>something from you that you don't want </v>

581
00:26:58.911 --> 00:27:01.220
<v Speaker 1>to get you and I'm coercing you into </v>
<v Speaker 1>being sneaky about it and yeah,</v>

582
00:27:01.221 --> 00:27:06.221
<v Speaker 1>that's a different story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a dark thing that it happened.</v>

583
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.560
<v Speaker 1>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of women,</v>

584
00:27:07.561 --> 00:27:08.430
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>

585
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to several women who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been roofied you fuck it up when I was </v>

586
00:27:14.761 --> 00:27:19.761
<v Speaker 1>in high school that I had once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty hot girl who was just </v>

587
00:27:19.761 --> 00:27:23.400
<v Speaker 1>passed out drunk and there was two guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the party were clearly just moving in</v>

588
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:26.910
<v Speaker 1>that direction and clear and all about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what was going on.</v>

589
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.280
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no ambiguity there.</v>

590
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Dates like that easier trying to rape </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody that's not.</v>

591
00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:37.660
<v Speaker 1>So I remember just I added my good </v>
<v Speaker 1>Samaritan Day of my life where I just </v>

592
00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.560
<v Speaker 1>kind of picked her up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking her outside bird throw up </v>

593
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:42.560
<v Speaker 1>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

594
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.880
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is like the easiest bad scenario,</v>

595
00:27:44.881 --> 00:27:45.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr.</v>

596
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:50.390
<v Speaker 1>This is not a pleasant one and he's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>a game to one where everybody's drunk </v>

597
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:52.320
<v Speaker 1>and it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no intent Dz.</v>

598
00:27:52.321 --> 00:27:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Somebody will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

599
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.710
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going after that.</v>

600
00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:01.010
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if anyone's ever done a study </v>
<v Speaker 1>on places that have legalized </v>

601
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.821
<v Speaker 1>prostitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or more or less sexual assaults </v>

602
00:28:04.821 --> 00:28:07.170
<v Speaker 1>from what I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do believe I've seen studies about</v>

603
00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:12.171
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was less because Jamie head </v>

604
00:28:12.171 --> 00:28:12.171
<v Speaker 1>to google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

605
00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

606
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:18.040
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would assume that when it's not </v>

607
00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.201
<v Speaker 1>something that's almost impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>attain because you think about it like </v>

608
00:28:21.201 --> 00:28:23.730
<v Speaker 1>the average guy who makes a good living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

609
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:28.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe occasionally you could afford to </v>

610
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:29.170
<v Speaker 1>spend $500 on a prostitute or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Holocaust.</v>

611
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:34.640
<v Speaker 1>But the idea of getting that prostitute </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in a sexual relationship with you </v>

612
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.570
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily is almost out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

613
00:28:36.571 --> 00:28:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

614
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.390
<v Speaker 1>if you're goofy looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

615
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.970
<v Speaker 1>you can pay that girl and she'll fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

616
00:28:41.971 --> 00:28:45.840
<v Speaker 1>And the weight of that exchange has sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of been lifted.</v>

617
00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:50.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a potential that you could get </v>

618
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.001
<v Speaker 1>addicted to going to prostitutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can get addicted to go into a </v>

619
00:28:53.001 --> 00:28:53.001
<v Speaker 1>pool hall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

620
00:28:53.001 --> 00:28:55.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get addicted to swimming.</v>

621
00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:58.770
<v Speaker 1>I know people that every morning they </v>
<v Speaker 1>get up and they fucking swim.</v>

622
00:28:58.771 --> 00:29:00.400
<v Speaker 1>They have to swim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't swim to that.</v>

623
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:04.170
<v Speaker 1>And if you have the money to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

624
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.870
<v Speaker 1>there was a don winslow it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you ever read that guy.</v>

625
00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:08.640
<v Speaker 1>He's a master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don winslow.</v>

626
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No really good.</v>

627
00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never heard of them.</v>

628
00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:15.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy who did the movie savages.</v>

629
00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

630
00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Savages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oliver Stone movie.</v>

631
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was basically,</v>

632
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:24.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that a good movie?</v>

633
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:26.220
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen it to be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read the book.</v>

634
00:29:26.221 --> 00:29:27.370
<v Speaker 1>The book was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

635
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.280
<v Speaker 1>the movie I didn't or anything that made</v>
<v Speaker 1>me want to see it.</v>

636
00:29:30.281 --> 00:29:31.000
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 1>she's only with you because of your </v>

641
00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:43.160
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

<v Speaker 1>good thing I have money.</v>

643
00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.990

644
00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

645
00:29:50.891 --> 00:29:53.680
<v Speaker 1>She's only with you because of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

646
00:29:53.681 --> 00:29:54.970
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With you,</v>

647
00:29:54.971 --> 00:29:57.010

<v Speaker 1>shoulders,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean,</v>

649
00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:07.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's only with you because you're more </v>

650
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.370
<v Speaker 1>attractive and more intelligent and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful than me.</v>

651
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

652
00:30:08.021 --> 00:30:13.021
<v Speaker 1>Well that just diminished me to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>point where I could no longer enjoy the </v>

653
00:30:13.021 --> 00:30:15.100
<v Speaker 1>sexual sexual favors of this young lady </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>

654
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:20.160
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are people that try to diminish </v>

655
00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.590
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're only be because of goose kind of </v>

656
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:24.400
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were talking about the sex work.</v>

657
00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I find it hilarious when people look </v>
<v Speaker 1>down on it,</v>

658
00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:29.860
<v Speaker 1>kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

659
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you work the job you have?</v>

660
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Is that a job that you would have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If nobody pays you,</v>

661
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:40.180
<v Speaker 1>would you do that same stuff anyway in </v>
<v Speaker 1>99 percent of people would say,</v>

662
00:30:40.181 --> 00:30:43.690
<v Speaker 1>nice because I want to get paid and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like playing to exactly our.</v>

663
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:47.230
<v Speaker 1>You are different from a hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Embrace your inner hooker,</v>

664
00:30:47.231 --> 00:30:48.530
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it for demand it.</v>

665
00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:53.560
<v Speaker 1>That's where it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your inner hooker researchers </v>

666
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.791
<v Speaker 1>decriminalize prostitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhode Island lead to fewer rape and </v>

667
00:30:56.791 --> 00:30:57.240
<v Speaker 1>fewer gonorrhea cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point,</v>

668
00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:00.100
<v Speaker 1>but that's not even legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just decriminalized,</v>

669
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.260
<v Speaker 1>so that means you can get arrested for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

670
00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

671
00:31:04.251 --> 00:31:07.150
<v Speaker 1>And stuff on both ends of it actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's that?</v>

672
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I was finding it on articles on both </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends.</v>

673
00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:11.650
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was going up and down.</v>

674
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.230
<v Speaker 1>There's people saying both clearly </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed that it increases.</v>

675
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:19.300
<v Speaker 1>Not Statistics clearly show that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>decreases that kind of stuff.</v>

676
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's studies for whichever side you </v>

677
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:24.540
<v Speaker 1>really want to pay it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

678

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.120
<v Speaker 1>But if you can go to one of those places</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had sex with you,</v>

692
00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:04.960
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what a great exchange.</v>

693
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:05.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

694
00:32:05.921 --> 00:32:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm nice to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a bunch of money or nice.</v>

695
00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's puritanical.</v>

696
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.090
<v Speaker 1>It totally is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you really break it down,</v>

697
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.500
<v Speaker 1>why would it be illegal to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can do for free?</v>

698
00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:19.500
<v Speaker 1>If you can do it for money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

699
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you could do it for free,</v>

700
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:26.190
<v Speaker 1>why can't you do it for money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because everything else you can do like </v>

701
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.440
<v Speaker 1>massage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could give people foot massages</v>

702
00:32:26.441 --> 00:32:27.640
<v Speaker 1>all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

703
00:32:27.641 --> 00:32:31.000
<v Speaker 1>But the fit's a sexual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly it's illegal and it's terrible.</v>

704
00:32:31.001 --> 00:32:31.720
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find a dealer.</v>

705
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:36.750
<v Speaker 1>It's disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a puritanical religious crap that we </v>

706
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.040
<v Speaker 1>carry with us from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

707
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.370
<v Speaker 1>another time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just still around</v>

708
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:42.620
<v Speaker 3>in people's mentality because when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think about it,</v>

709
00:32:42.621 --> 00:32:44.720
<v Speaker 3>I think it's complete bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

710
00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.220
<v Speaker 3>it works our minds too because it turned</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex into some forbidden dirty act.</v>

711
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:49.940
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

712
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:50.870
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

713
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's um,</v>

714
00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:57.720
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole like pattern of it is very </v>

715
00:32:58.191 --> 00:32:59.960
<v Speaker 3>difficult to break though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

716
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:05.240
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they broke it somewhat in the </v>

717
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:05.240
<v Speaker 3>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

718
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.770
<v Speaker 3>summer of love and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were all on acid.</v>

719
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.340
<v Speaker 3>That definitely out that totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is what acid does.</v>

720
00:33:13.341 --> 00:33:16.340
<v Speaker 3>That's what mushrooms do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what DMT does.</v>

721
00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.660
<v Speaker 3>That paradigm shifting reset button </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you go,</v>

722
00:33:20.661 --> 00:33:22.610
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well why am I doing it this way?</v>

723
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:23.920
<v Speaker 3>Why am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

724
00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:26.030
<v Speaker 3>That's where all those songs like love </v>
<v Speaker 3>the one you're with.</v>

725
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:30.200
<v Speaker 3>All that came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the free love generation.</v>

726
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:31.160
<v Speaker 3>It was different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

727
00:33:31.161 --> 00:33:32.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that interesting?</v>

728
00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:33.200
<v Speaker 3>Like that's all.</v>

729
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.200
<v Speaker 3>It took.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a little bit of drugs and people </v>

730
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.081
<v Speaker 3>went from father knows best to love the </v>
<v Speaker 3>one you're with and like inside of 10 </v>

731
00:33:41.081 --> 00:33:41.081
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>90,</v>

732
00:33:41.081 --> 00:33:43.400
<v Speaker 3>67,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 feet times music wise,</v>

733
00:33:43.401 --> 00:33:45.260
<v Speaker 3>you listen to what people are really </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying too.</v>

734
00:33:45.261 --> 00:33:50.261
<v Speaker 3>In 1961,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they are listening to by 1968 and </v>

735
00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:51.740
<v Speaker 3>it feels like 30 on 30 years have gone </v>
<v Speaker 3>by.</v>

736
00:33:51.741 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 3>It's a nice night than day kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

737
00:33:54.891 --> 00:33:59.891
<v Speaker 3>They are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did that even happen in that little </v>

738
00:33:59.891 --> 00:33:59.891
<v Speaker 3>period of time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

739
00:33:59.891 --> 00:34:04.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll go from your low motown to Jimi </v>

740
00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:07.460
<v Speaker 3>Hendrix and it doesn't even sound </v>
<v Speaker 3>remotely close.</v>

741
00:34:07.461 --> 00:34:09.440
<v Speaker 3>It's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The clothes,</v>

742
00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:14.600
<v Speaker 3>they start wearing bandanas and bell </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottoms and freaky vests and shirts with</v>

743
00:34:14.601 --> 00:34:19.601
<v Speaker 3>flowers on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the whole thing just fucking </v>

744
00:34:19.601 --> 00:34:22.040
<v Speaker 3>completely flipped on its head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just some drugs these much time.</v>

745
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:27.080
<v Speaker 3>That's what people don't really truly </v>
<v Speaker 3>comprehend and I didn't truly comprehend</v>

746
00:34:27.081 --> 00:34:31.400
<v Speaker 3>until I got older because when I was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid and I was in school,</v>

747
00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:31.800
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

748
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.540
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I graduated from school in 1985.</v>

749
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:36.950
<v Speaker 3>That's when I graduated from high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

750
00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:42.340
<v Speaker 3>And if you stop and think about that 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years before that was the height of all </v>

751
00:34:43.671 --> 00:34:44.810
<v Speaker 3>that freaky shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

752
00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:50.110
<v Speaker 3>It was alive and popping in 1965.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>

753
00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:52.620
<v Speaker 3>that's not that long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

754
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:57.490
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 95 to us like 1995 seems like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other day,</v>

755
00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:02.990
<v Speaker 3>years ago to think about 1995 just being</v>
<v Speaker 3>freaks and hippies and woodstock and </v>

756
00:35:04.461 --> 00:35:07.820
<v Speaker 3>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the government just threw water</v>

757
00:35:07.821 --> 00:35:12.821
<v Speaker 3>on the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put that fire out and everything calmed </v>

758
00:35:12.821 --> 00:35:13.180
<v Speaker 3>down in the seventies and the eighties </v>
<v Speaker 3>that gave everybody coke.</v>

759
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:18.520
<v Speaker 3>And then Miami vice and Don Johnson </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't have any socks on and he's </v>

760
00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.671
<v Speaker 3>driving around the Testarossa and it all</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of got to this different place,</v>

761
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.260
<v Speaker 3>like they took the drugs out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>equation and there was this big void and</v>

762
00:35:27.261 --> 00:35:32.261
<v Speaker 3>no one knew what to do and it just sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of like had this chaotic bouncing </v>

763
00:35:32.261 --> 00:35:36.671
<v Speaker 3>against the wall thing where it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to find its equilibrium and find </v>

764
00:35:36.671 --> 00:35:37.100
<v Speaker 3>it's harmonious vibration.</v>

765
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.200
<v Speaker 3>Get back to where it would've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but inexorably altered because of this </v>

766
00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.080
<v Speaker 3>one decade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Time.</v>

767
00:35:43.081 --> 00:35:48.081
<v Speaker 3>I mean even the dogs just mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like in the eighties people </v>

768
00:35:48.081 --> 00:35:50.781
<v Speaker 3>were in doing drugs but nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our dogs go from psychedelics to hard </v>

769
00:35:50.781 --> 00:35:52.440
<v Speaker 3>stuff like crack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crack.</v>

770
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.310
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking the same drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here is a very different kind of game.</v>

771
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.900
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

772
00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:02.930
<v Speaker 3>It's really amazing when you get older </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you realize that 10 years is </v>

773
00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:03.020
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a.</v>

774
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:08.300
<v Speaker 3>like 10 years ago it was 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is exactly like today.</v>

775
00:36:08.941 --> 00:36:10.620
<v Speaker 3>What was the difference in 2005 and </v>
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

776
00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:13.260
<v Speaker 3>no iphones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other than that,</v>

777
00:36:13.261 --> 00:36:15.300
<v Speaker 3>what's the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were all online.</v>

778
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:20.480
<v Speaker 3>Everybody had email,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was less social media and </v>

779
00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.950
<v Speaker 3>things along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but ultimately is very little difference</v>

780
00:36:22.951 --> 00:36:26.790
<v Speaker 3>between today in 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had a 2005 car,</v>

781
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:31.910
<v Speaker 3>that's a nice car that you could drive </v>
<v Speaker 3>that around and be just like a modern </v>

782
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:32.370
<v Speaker 3>car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be November 2015 car.</v>

783
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.370
<v Speaker 3>No different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not much difference in the music.</v>

784
00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.010
<v Speaker 3>We listen to some music from 2005,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so yeah,</v>

785
00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:40.500
<v Speaker 3>pretty similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big thing,</v>

786
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.450
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can take a song from 2005.</v>

787
00:36:42.451 --> 00:36:45.690
<v Speaker 3>You could totally release it today like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a hit and it'll be a hit today,</v>

788
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:51.290
<v Speaker 3>but the difference between a hit from </v>
<v Speaker 3>1955 and a hit from 1960 five cents day.</v>

789
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:58.280
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a difference about which is why to </v>

790
00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.070
<v Speaker 3>this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people about the 1960 seat there who </v>

791
00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:03.210
<v Speaker 3>love it or hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have really not medical oncology or</v>

792
00:37:03.211 --> 00:37:04.680
<v Speaker 3>ever seen them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

793
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:09.710
<v Speaker 3>oh thank God for the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where all the coolest stuff </v>

794
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.710
<v Speaker 3>started up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything.</v>

795
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.220
<v Speaker 3>He's very far to find people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>neutral about it.</v>

796
00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:16.710
<v Speaker 3>This is the differences of the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that got the drugs and didn't get any </v>

797
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.921
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that were getting crew cuts and </v>

798
00:37:18.921 --> 00:37:20.150
<v Speaker 3>fucking goddamn headache.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

799
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:21.000
<v Speaker 3>they never got it.</v>

800
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.410
<v Speaker 3>They didn't understand they missed the </v>
<v Speaker 3>boat.</v>

801
00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Vietnam.</v>

802
00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:26.990
<v Speaker 3>They didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I put.</v>

803
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:33.030
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating to think that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>culture can shift and change so quickly.</v>

804
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.250
<v Speaker 3>That must have been terrifying for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>old guard.</v>

805
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.230
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that that were.</v>

806
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.800
<v Speaker 3>I mean you also have to think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

807
00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.030
<v Speaker 3>the ability to communicate about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

808
00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:44.790
<v Speaker 3>about these complex issues didn't exist </v>
<v Speaker 3>back then.</v>

809
00:37:44.791 --> 00:37:47.510
<v Speaker 3>So all you can do is go down to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>local bar and complain or your.</v>

810
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:50.070
<v Speaker 3>I guess they didn't even have coffee </v>
<v Speaker 3>shops back then,</v>

811
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:53.390
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No coffee shops is who the fuck when,</v>

812
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:55.590
<v Speaker 3>when there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was like diners.</v>

813
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:59.010
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I didn't have like a starbucks,</v>

814
00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit didn't even exist,</v>

815
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:02.820
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's nuts.</v>

816
00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:08.060
<v Speaker 3>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you would go to Dunkin donuts and </v>

817
00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:08.430
<v Speaker 3>get coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that was it.</v>

818
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:13.670
<v Speaker 3>There was no starbucks and no place like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mom and pop store wasn't just open </v>

819
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:18.060
<v Speaker 3>tables where people could sit down and </v>
<v Speaker 3>chat with you and get your coffee,</v>

820
00:38:18.061 --> 00:38:20.730
<v Speaker 3>get out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was all local.</v>

821
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:24.150
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember like if you're a worldly</v>
<v Speaker 3>person in Boston,</v>

822
00:38:24.151 --> 00:38:27.510
<v Speaker 3>you would get the New York Times like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was to show everybody that you were</v>

823
00:38:27.511 --> 00:38:27.990
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

824
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:35.480
<v Speaker 3>If you're a dummy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would get the herald and if you </v>

825
00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:35.480
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

826
00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.300
<v Speaker 3>local,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

827
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:39.370
<v Speaker 3>you're on the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get the Boston Globe guys to deliver</v>

828
00:38:39.371 --> 00:38:41.560
<v Speaker 3>all three of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The New York Times.</v>

829
00:38:41.561 --> 00:38:44.320
<v Speaker 3>I was very rare and whenever I would </v>
<v Speaker 3>deliver the New York Times,</v>

830
00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:49.060
<v Speaker 3>the dude always had like a bmw or a Saab</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

831
00:38:49.061 --> 00:38:50.380
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They always had like some,</v>

832
00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:55.300
<v Speaker 3>some cool car and they lived in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cool house and they just,</v>

833
00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:00.500
<v Speaker 3>they wanted to be more into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't want to live in New York </v>

834
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:00.500
<v Speaker 3>necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if they did,</v>

835
00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.930
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have the funds to move </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

836
00:39:01.931 --> 00:39:05.910
<v Speaker 3>but they wanted to be worldly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They sounded like they had the money.</v>

837
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:06.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's.</v>

838
00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:09.460
<v Speaker 3>And that's how you got ahold of the real</v>
<v Speaker 3>news.</v>

839
00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:12.820
<v Speaker 3>That's how you had your finger on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulse and you had to be active.</v>

840
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

841
00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:19.900
<v Speaker 3>like um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was this guy that I knew that </v>

842
00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:19.900
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

843
00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:19.900
<v Speaker 3>he would read all the papers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would read the times,</v>

844
00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:22.690
<v Speaker 3>he'd read the Herald and I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would ask him like,</v>

845
00:39:22.691 --> 00:39:27.691
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why do you read all these different </v>

846
00:39:27.691 --> 00:39:27.691
<v Speaker 3>papers?</v>

847
00:39:27.691 --> 00:39:29.580
<v Speaker 3>Want to just pick one and read them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like to really get a sense of </v>

848
00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.190
<v Speaker 3>what's going on in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really got to read all of them.</v>

849
00:39:30.191 --> 00:39:35.191
<v Speaker 3>Like the New York Times will cover some </v>
<v Speaker 3>subjects globally that the Boston Globe </v>

850
00:39:35.191 --> 00:39:39.160
<v Speaker 3>won't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boston Herald doesn't give a fuck about </v>

851
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.921
<v Speaker 3>what's happening anywhere but Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was like this thing where you </v>

852
00:39:40.921 --> 00:39:42.790
<v Speaker 3>had to kind of like search around to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

853
00:39:42.791 --> 00:39:47.791
<v Speaker 3>a sound like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a distant sound of the earth of like </v>

854
00:39:47.791 --> 00:39:52.260
<v Speaker 3>what's actually going on on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas today it's unavoidable today </v>

855
00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:52.690
<v Speaker 3>actually kind of hide from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

856
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.900
<v Speaker 2>I know you said no spoiler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to know about that.</v>

857
00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:58.090
<v Speaker 2>Tell me about the walking dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

858
00:39:58.940 --> 00:39:59.340
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

859
00:39:59.341 --> 00:40:02.020
<v Speaker 2>It's when I was growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me being in Italy too,</v>

860
00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.740
<v Speaker 2>which was even further removed from </v>
<v Speaker 2>several of the newest.</v>

861
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:08.890
<v Speaker 2>I love basketball and I remember when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was maybe eight,</v>

862
00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:13.920
<v Speaker 2>nine years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to find out who won the NBA </v>

863
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.260
<v Speaker 2>finals and that was the game on Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened,</v>

864
00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:19.650
<v Speaker 2>and I leaked earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have to call the one magazine you </v>

865
00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:23.311
<v Speaker 2>need to let Dale dealt with basketball </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would come out once a month and I </v>

866
00:40:23.311 --> 00:40:27.301
<v Speaker 2>would call them and they had talked to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their friend in New York with two of </v>

867
00:40:27.301 --> 00:40:28.660
<v Speaker 2>them are one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise I would have had to wait three</v>

868
00:40:28.661 --> 00:40:33.661
<v Speaker 2>weeks until the next day she'll come up </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the MBA finals earlier.</v>

869
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the word that I know that I grew </v>

870
00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:39.370
<v Speaker 2>up even.</v>

871
00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.050
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we even think about today?</v>

872
00:40:41.051 --> 00:40:44.860
<v Speaker 2>You can be on the top of the Malaya and </v>
<v Speaker 2>find the right connection.</v>

873
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:49.870
<v Speaker 2>You can watch the game live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's a whole lot that are </v>

874
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:50.230
<v Speaker 2>game altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

875
00:40:50.231 --> 00:40:55.231
<v Speaker 2>You were reading about basketball that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened weeks ago and get all excited.</v>

876
00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.410
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm going to find out.</v>

877
00:40:58.411 --> 00:41:03.411
<v Speaker 2>It's now about came.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when were the first organized </v>

878
00:41:03.411 --> 00:41:06.901
<v Speaker 2>sports?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was 89 hundredths already late 18 </v>

879
00:41:06.901 --> 00:41:07.080
<v Speaker 2>hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

880
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:12.210
<v Speaker 2>as you start to having a whole bunch and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an awesome story about the </v>

881
00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:13.390
<v Speaker 2>devito window football in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>

882
00:41:13.391 --> 00:41:15.940
<v Speaker 2>which was by no means the first sizeable</v>
<v Speaker 2>was before and noticing,</v>

883
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.200
<v Speaker 2>but football is funny because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the story that late 89 that it's.</v>

884
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:25.210
<v Speaker 2>There's no more frontier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are no more Indian wars because </v>

885
00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:28.021
<v Speaker 2>everybody's been calling course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there was not any more traditional </v>

886
00:41:28.021 --> 00:41:30.430
<v Speaker 2>for kind of per class males to go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>military fight the Indians,</v>

887
00:41:30.431 --> 00:41:31.120
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stuff.</v>

888
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:36.900
<v Speaker 2>So many of the old guard fell that there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are kids who are growing up to be a </v>

889
00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Williams is like what you are into and </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed a few Indians.</v>

890
00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:40.420
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not a real man.</v>

891
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:46.480
<v Speaker 2>So they would send them to all the Ivy </v>
<v Speaker 2>League school that were beginning to </v>

892
00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.060
<v Speaker 2>papa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they felt like,</v>

893
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:48.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you read the books,</v>

894
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:51.290
<v Speaker 2>you don't kill anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about your masculinity.</v>

895
00:41:51.291 --> 00:41:52.910
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So somebody was like,</v>

896
00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:57.911
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can play this game where they beat </v>

897
00:41:57.911 --> 00:42:00.881
<v Speaker 2>the shit out of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great to be these mainly physical </v>

898
00:42:00.881 --> 00:42:01.490
<v Speaker 2>game where they just brutalize each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

899
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:03.220
<v Speaker 2>Then at least,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

900
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:05.530
<v Speaker 2>it's not as good as bringing home a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>scale for.</v>

901
00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:06.620
<v Speaker 2>But it's something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

902
00:42:06.621 --> 00:42:09.620
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it saves their masculinity and stuff and</v>

903
00:42:09.621 --> 00:42:12.260
<v Speaker 2>that's how a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you see the old,</v>

904
00:42:12.261 --> 00:42:14.900
<v Speaker 2>the big football programs of the late 80</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

905
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:20.110
<v Speaker 2>early 99,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were all ivy Lee's code stuff that </v>

906
00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:20.110
<v Speaker 2>today you'll never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

907
00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:20.180
<v Speaker 2>Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yale,</v>

908
00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:21.940
<v Speaker 2>they had a top football program.</v>

909
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:26.950
<v Speaker 2>So it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the hell did that even at a lot of </v>

910
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:27.170
<v Speaker 2>it was because it was a way to show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

911
00:42:27.171 --> 00:42:29.090
<v Speaker 2>I read the books but I'm still a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

912
00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:31.280
<v Speaker 2>I'd still tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

913
00:42:31.281 --> 00:42:33.170
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

914
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.920
<v Speaker 2>So it was a substitute for war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

915
00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:40.170
<v Speaker 2>W much totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's kind of exactly what it </v>

916
00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:40.700
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you watch a game,</v>

917
00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:41.750
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

918
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:44.120
<v Speaker 2>you're winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're attacking,</v>

919
00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to defend.</v>

920
00:42:45.981 --> 00:42:49.010
<v Speaker 2>You're crossing a boundary which is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

921
00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:52.570
<v Speaker 2>the border to the city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gates to the,</v>

922
00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.230
<v Speaker 2>to the brothel or to the castle or to </v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever you're trying to break into.</v>

923
00:42:57.530 --> 00:42:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

924
00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:04.130
<v Speaker 2>and even at these old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top schools were ivy league,</v>

925
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.600
<v Speaker 2>upper class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

926
00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:10.070
<v Speaker 2>super rich people and then one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top was carlisle Indian school,</v>

927
00:43:10.071 --> 00:43:15.071
<v Speaker 2>which was the lowest of the low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like poorest people in the United </v>

928
00:43:15.071 --> 00:43:15.071
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>

929
00:43:15.071 --> 00:43:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Indian kids who got sent there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>boarding schools that nothing to do.</v>

930
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:22.600
<v Speaker 2>They would play football and so what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would do is that they will study </v>

931
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.680
<v Speaker 2>the rulebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to figure out what is the.</v>

932
00:43:24.681 --> 00:43:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's doing that technically is legal</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that you know,</v>

933
00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:32.880
<v Speaker 2>what kind of loophole can we play with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they would start using some tactical</v>

934
00:43:33.981 --> 00:43:36.620
<v Speaker 2>that nobody had used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kill everybody in the process.</v>

935
00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.390
<v Speaker 2>So then the league goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

936
00:43:38.391 --> 00:43:40.510
<v Speaker 2>we can them into that NBA is beating </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher to,</v>

937
00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.110
<v Speaker 2>so let's change that or what's that </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>

938
00:43:42.111 --> 00:43:44.570
<v Speaker 2>They do make it illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what things weren't.</v>

939
00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.360
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

940
00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.330
<v Speaker 2>I wish I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read through the list.</v>

941
00:43:47.331 --> 00:43:48.280
<v Speaker 2>There were some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were really,</v>

942
00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.350
<v Speaker 2>but basically they develop the game of </v>
<v Speaker 2>football in terms of,</v>

943
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:56.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this constant game between the league </v>

944
00:43:56.650 --> 00:43:56.900
<v Speaker 2>and the Indian schools where these guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>use some loophole,</v>

945
00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:02.050
<v Speaker 2>the leak can't seem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes it illegal and then the next time </v>

946
00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:04.481
<v Speaker 2>they use a different loophole and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the consultants have a lot of the rules </v>

947
00:44:04.481 --> 00:44:05.030
<v Speaker 2>of football were shaped to start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

948
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.860
<v Speaker 2>those guys do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's stop it right now.</v>

949
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:08.750
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's lucky for them.</v>

950
00:44:08.751 --> 00:44:13.751
<v Speaker 2>Black people weren't playing back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't change all the rules.</v>

951
00:44:13.911 --> 00:44:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excellent.</v>

952
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:16.490
<v Speaker 2>That's what they've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they just give up.</v>

953
00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:19.580
<v Speaker 2>It's mostly black so you can try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>

954
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:25.090
<v Speaker 2>You can get really big and white and </v>
<v Speaker 2>block runners or you can get a.</v>

955
00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:30.240
<v Speaker 2>You got good eyesight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand eye coordination to throw the ball </v>

956
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:30.240
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black people could run really fast,</v>

957
00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:31.380
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

958
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.190
<v Speaker 1>it's so rare you get like a super speedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>white guy.</v>

959
00:44:35.191 --> 00:44:40.191
<v Speaker 1>When one comes around he runs like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>black guy to Lariat is fucking </v>

960
00:44:43.141 --> 00:44:44.900
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's funny.</v>

961
00:44:44.901 --> 00:44:49.901
<v Speaker 1>I would just stereotypes change over </v>
<v Speaker 1>time because like eerily you add the </v>

962
00:44:49.901 --> 00:44:54.110
<v Speaker 1>show like ed breaks down many of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>early natural law,</v>

963
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:58.620
<v Speaker 1>the natural Jewish wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so which one or you know,</v>

964
00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.680
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the early books were all Irish </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the,</v>

965
00:45:01.681 --> 00:45:06.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of Jewish boxers back on a day </v>

966
00:45:06.681 --> 00:45:10.160
<v Speaker 1>bake time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there were people that were fucked </v>

967
00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:10.160
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

968
00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:10.160
<v Speaker 1>they were the early immigrants and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were struggling.</v>

969
00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.540
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's always seems to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be the,</v>

970
00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:17.600
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the group that is like the most recent </v>

971
00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:17.870
<v Speaker 1>immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like now we get to,</v>

972
00:45:17.871 --> 00:45:22.871
<v Speaker 1>you get a lot of Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of Russians in both Europe and in </v>

973
00:45:22.871 --> 00:45:24.810
<v Speaker 1>America was so many Russians in mma.</v>

974
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Dagestan of Dagestan people and fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely disproportionate amount of </v>

975
00:45:30.391 --> 00:45:34.130
<v Speaker 1>elite fighters to I really fucking tough</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys from Russia.</v>

976
00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Not if you've ever used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's as almost data with TB code,</v>

977
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.340
<v Speaker 1>but if you ever used to toughness </v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout your life,</v>

978
00:45:40.341 --> 00:45:42.480
<v Speaker 1>then client meeting during doesn't seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>like much.</v>

979
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:45.840
<v Speaker 1>He's got old shampoo protech that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>client meeting Katie has.</v>

980
00:45:45.841 --> 00:45:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Hell exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly what it is,</v>

981
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:53.570
<v Speaker 1>is exactly what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also like the hunger that you </v>

982
00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:56.961
<v Speaker 1>have because your life has been like </v>
<v Speaker 1>just filled with despair and struggle </v>

983
00:45:57.421 --> 00:46:02.070
<v Speaker 1>and in a lot of abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like violence becomes some sort of an</v>

984
00:46:02.071 --> 00:46:04.710
<v Speaker 1>automatic response to reaching out for </v>
<v Speaker 1>abuse.</v>

985
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

986
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.880
<v Speaker 1>reaching out in response for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the abusive suffered like they have a </v>

987
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.850
<v Speaker 1>chip on your shoulder comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

988
00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone just just waiting for </v>

989
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.020
<v Speaker 1>someone to say some shit because he just</v>
<v Speaker 1>been dealing bottled up.</v>

990
00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:22.680
<v Speaker 1>You have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like please just cross that line.</v>

991
00:46:22.681 --> 00:46:27.681
<v Speaker 1>So I have an excuse to beat the shit out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fuel right now for a few generations </v>

992
00:46:27.681 --> 00:46:28.290
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your kids are pussies.</v>

993
00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at her like,</v>

994
00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.840
<v Speaker 1>go play football.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dammit.</v>

995
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:37.920
<v Speaker 1>What kind of man are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's weird because like isn't it </v>

996
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.210
<v Speaker 1>kind of a good thing that they become </v>
<v Speaker 1>pussies because that means we've become </v>

997
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:41.640
<v Speaker 1>civilized and everyone's sort of calmed </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

998
00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:46.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is weird fine line that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we walk because ultimately we would like</v>

999
00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:51.650
<v Speaker 1>to have no violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like ultimately we would love it if you </v>

1000
00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:51.780
<v Speaker 1>never had to worry about a threat of </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>

1001
00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.170
<v Speaker 1>just go through your entire life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never worry about anybody shooting.</v>

1002
00:46:55.171 --> 00:47:00.171
<v Speaker 1>You are stabbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are beating you up and that'd be </v>

1003
00:47:00.171 --> 00:47:02.601
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But along the line you kind of lose out </v>

1004
00:47:03.091 --> 00:47:07.420
<v Speaker 1>on a lot of the stuff that comes along </v>
<v Speaker 1>with living a hard life.</v>

1005
00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The character that you develop.</v>

1006
00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody that I know that grew up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a tough neighborhood,</v>

1007
00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:15.270
<v Speaker 1>they have a sharpness to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1008
00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:18.870
<v Speaker 1>and there's a character that they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they possessed that the people that</v>

1009
00:47:18.871 --> 00:47:21.910
<v Speaker 1>grew up super cushy and some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1010
00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut Country Club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>estate type situation,</v>

1011
00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:29.780
<v Speaker 1>read the notice and I didn't get to walk</v>
<v Speaker 1>into her to environment,</v>

1012
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.340
<v Speaker 2>but he definitely was not a upper class </v>
<v Speaker 2>three Chinese thing.</v>

1013
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:37.000
<v Speaker 2>So to me dealing with gangsters was kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of normal.</v>

1014
00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1015
00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Jessica and stared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are clear rules of the game,</v>

1016
00:47:40.151 --> 00:47:41.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to deal with them.</v>

1017
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.860
<v Speaker 2>And so to see people who don't have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

1018
00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.590
<v Speaker 2>when they deal with somebody who is by </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>

1019
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:49.960
<v Speaker 2>by what kind of gangsters like mafia </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

1020
00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:52.000
<v Speaker 2>not formally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1021
00:47:52.001 --> 00:47:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Usually not mafia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more just like,</v>

1022
00:47:53.831 --> 00:47:55.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do deal.</v>

1023
00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:57.730
<v Speaker 2>People who uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1024
00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:02.600
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing where it's like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys who are awesome series our taste of</v>

1025
00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:07.900
<v Speaker 2>shoplifting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just can go into a store and walk </v>

1026
00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:09.070
<v Speaker 2>out and they would do it pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 2>professionally where they make a living.</v>

1027
00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1028
00:48:10.151 --> 00:48:13.980
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that where he's always like </v>
<v Speaker 2>crossing to do any legal stuff.</v>

1029
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've met some guys who were </v>

1030
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.330
<v Speaker 2>probably more well connected in a more </v>
<v Speaker 2>formal way but not,</v>

1031
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:24.570
<v Speaker 2>that was not the normal thing but normal</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing was guys will do a lot of illegal </v>

1032
00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:28.681
<v Speaker 2>stuff where maybe they are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically against during a strict </v>

1033
00:48:28.681 --> 00:48:29.800
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people who get into a lot of fights.</v>

1034
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:34.800
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing where it's like sort </v>

1035
00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.140
<v Speaker 2>of outside of the normal rules of </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilized society.</v>

1036
00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:40.000
<v Speaker 2>But to me it's like there are clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>rules of what you do with those guys.</v>

1037
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:45.300
<v Speaker 2>Usually if you treat them with respect </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't show yourself to be a </v>

1038
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:45.730
<v Speaker 2>wimp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they treat you fairly well.</v>

1039
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:48.790
<v Speaker 2>There's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you know how to play the game,</v>

1040
00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:51.340
<v Speaker 2>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know these guys will test you and if</v>

1041
00:48:51.341 --> 00:48:54.300
<v Speaker 2>they smell weakness then they'll clamp </v>
<v Speaker 2>down on you.</v>

1042
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:56.470
<v Speaker 2>And if you only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look down on them,</v>

1043
00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.080
<v Speaker 2>they will clamp down on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1044
00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:01.800
<v Speaker 2>there's a very clear rule of the game </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you play it right,</v>

1045
00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:04.900
<v Speaker 2>you can have very mellow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasant interactions.</v>

1046
00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:10.560
<v Speaker 2>But people who don't have that </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience that I see them interact </v>

1047
00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:10.630
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like don't say that.</v>

1048
00:49:10.631 --> 00:49:12.920
<v Speaker 2>You can not say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1049
00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:14.420
<v Speaker 2>that's just not good.</v>

1050
00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.870
<v Speaker 2>I ended well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bad.</v>

1051
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people have a real issue with </v>

1052
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.450
<v Speaker 2>letting people in to their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you would see that.</v>

1053
00:49:22.451 --> 00:49:27.451
<v Speaker 2>Like that was what people always said </v>
<v Speaker 2>about like rap music and one of the big </v>

1054
00:49:27.451 --> 00:49:29.050
<v Speaker 2>problems with rap music because these </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys would make it and they would become</v>

1055
00:49:29.051 --> 00:49:34.051
<v Speaker 2>legit and then they would let like </v>
<v Speaker 2>gangsters in their life because they </v>

1056
00:49:34.051 --> 00:49:36.610
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be seen with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to be legit.</v>

1057
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:39.490
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are like completely intertwined in their</v>

1058
00:49:39.491 --> 00:49:40.030
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1059
00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:43.600
<v Speaker 2>Apparently that happened with Edward </v>
<v Speaker 2>James Almost when he did that movie.</v>

1060
00:49:43.601 --> 00:49:45.070
<v Speaker 2>American May.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1061
00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:45.680
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1062
00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:46.870
<v Speaker 2>the story behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1063
00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:49.630
<v Speaker 2>That was scared to business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1064
00:49:49.631 --> 00:49:53.710
<v Speaker 2>It was heavy duty movie and the movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>was all about these Mexican gang bangers</v>

1065
00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:58.030
<v Speaker 2>and apparently he had become friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>with these guys,</v>

1066
00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:03.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>air quotes friend while filming this </v>

1067
00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.441
<v Speaker 2>movie and just got way too close and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they just started extorting them and </v>

1068
00:50:07.441 --> 00:50:07.570
<v Speaker 2>they started demanding money and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1069
00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.290
<v Speaker 2>when they knew where he lived and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>became a real fucking issue.</v>

1070
00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are their lunch at that point again,</v>

1071
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.760
<v Speaker 2>if they think that there's any weakness </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1072
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:17.850
<v Speaker 2>Danielle road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's a,</v>

1073
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:22.870
<v Speaker 2>there's a parade authorial aspect to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that game or you need to know how to </v>

1074
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:24.160
<v Speaker 2>play otherwise you're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sure he wanted to be down,</v>

1075
00:50:24.161 --> 00:50:29.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course doing this movie is going to </v>

1076
00:50:29.161 --> 00:50:29.161
<v Speaker 2>play this gangster</v>

1077
00:50:29.161 --> 00:50:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Cholo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the movie handle is gay sex in </v>

1078
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:33.620
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1079
00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:38.410
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a heavy moment man.</v>

1080
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of weirdness in that </v>

1081
00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:43.840
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what is going on?</v>

1082
00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was definitely bad stuff,</v>

1083
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:51.520
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole like becoming tight with </v>

1084
00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:51.520
<v Speaker 1>gangsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's a.</v>

1085
00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:53.580
<v Speaker 1>that's a common tale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>

1086
00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:59.280
<v Speaker 1>That has repeated itself over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again with Hollywood actors </v>

1087
00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:04.241
<v Speaker 1>that wanted to be like tough guys or </v>
<v Speaker 1>weakness right there because he mailed </v>

1088
00:51:04.241 --> 00:51:05.840
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want something from them or that you</v>

1089
00:51:05.841 --> 00:51:08.350
<v Speaker 1>look up to them in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that's waking.</v>

1090
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see you putting them down.</v>

1091
00:51:10.641 --> 00:51:15.641
<v Speaker 1>That's also a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're kind of screwed if you do one </v>

1092
00:51:15.641 --> 00:51:15.641
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're screwed.</v>

1093
00:51:15.641 --> 00:51:16.100
<v Speaker 1>If you do another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sort of a narrow ways.</v>

1094
00:51:16.101 --> 00:51:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Not too narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know there is a way to do it,</v>

1095
00:51:18.201 --> 00:51:20.590
<v Speaker 1>but if you step outside of it yet you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>

1096
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:22.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's.</v>

1097
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:24.560
<v Speaker 1>But it's the same thing is like getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>into fights.</v>

1098
00:51:24.561 --> 00:51:26.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are too aggressive,</v>

1099
00:51:26.571 --> 00:51:31.571
<v Speaker 1>you will get into fights because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>are challenging people and you're </v>

1100
00:51:31.571 --> 00:51:31.571
<v Speaker 1>backing them and against the and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to fight you back.</v>

1101
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:36.880
<v Speaker 1>But if you are too low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then people won't respect you and they </v>

1102
00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:36.880
<v Speaker 1>see you as a week and they come after </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1103
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:39.980
<v Speaker 1>You kind of have to have that boundary </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you are polite to people,</v>

1104
00:51:39.981 --> 00:51:44.981
<v Speaker 1>they are nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the message is look on nights </v>

1105
00:51:44.981 --> 00:51:45.320
<v Speaker 1>because I chose to decide to cross that </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

1106
00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:50.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fuck you up right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that vibe where it's like you can </v>

1107
00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:52.400
<v Speaker 1>bring up the goods when it comes down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing down,</v>

1108
00:51:52.401 --> 00:51:57.401
<v Speaker 1>but you don't volunteer at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not as much a guy who was like </v>

1109
00:51:57.401 --> 00:51:58.550
<v Speaker 1>trying to get into a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what usually people are out for a</v>

1110
00:51:58.551 --> 00:52:00.350
<v Speaker 1>fight and to respect them by the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

1111
00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.760
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

1112
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to pick it up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pick the next one.</v>

1113
00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously there's a lot of </v>

1114
00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:08.700
<v Speaker 1>variables and sometimes run into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong person the wrong time.</v>

1115
00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:13.390
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a parallel with the animal </v>

1116
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:13.390
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you think about like dogs,</v>

1117
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:17.981
<v Speaker 1>like certain dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're around dogs and you panic and </v>

1118
00:52:17.981 --> 00:52:17.981
<v Speaker 1>you run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll chase you and bite you.</v>

1119
00:52:17.981 --> 00:52:18.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like instinctive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't,</v>

1120
00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:24.040
<v Speaker 1>they almost can't help it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you encounter the dogs or </v>

1121
00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:24.940
<v Speaker 1>even some wild animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1122
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:29.950
<v Speaker 1>and they say you have to stand your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground or yell at them like mountain </v>

1123
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:31.610
<v Speaker 1>lions specially up know they say you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to look big and make noise.</v>

1124
00:52:31.611 --> 00:52:32.270
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1125
00:52:32.271 --> 00:52:33.050
<v Speaker 1>fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of here.</v>

1126
00:52:33.051 --> 00:52:34.630
<v Speaker 1>It's too much work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1127
00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:35.930
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to get injured.</v>

1128
00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:37.120
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1129
00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:40.270
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for something easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when they knew,</v>

1130
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:43.010
<v Speaker 1>when they sense weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's almost nature,</v>

1131
00:52:43.180 --> 00:52:46.880
<v Speaker 1>like nature wants them to go after you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because look at this week,</v>

1132
00:52:46.881 --> 00:52:48.230
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't,</v>

1133
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:51.320
<v Speaker 1>let's just eat fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

1134
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:54.710
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was that kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was probably like 18,</v>

1135
00:52:54.711 --> 00:52:59.711
<v Speaker 1>19 years old and I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found myself in one the situation or </v>

1136
00:52:59.711 --> 00:53:03.330
<v Speaker 1>like what the fuck am I doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I basically ended up in the </v>

1137
00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:03.500
<v Speaker 1>middle of Togo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly gangs,</v>

1138
00:53:03.501 --> 00:53:08.501
<v Speaker 1>but close to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were about to get into a fight and </v>

1139
00:53:08.501 --> 00:53:08.501
<v Speaker 1>that was like west side story type </v>
<v Speaker 1>shined up,</v>

1140
00:53:08.501 --> 00:53:13.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's not reality mafia or blood and </v>

1141
00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:13.420
<v Speaker 1>canapes real gangster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1142
00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:13.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough guys.</v>

1143
00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And dealing with some guys and then </v>

1144
00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:20.320
<v Speaker 1>decided to group come along and I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle.</v>

1145
00:53:20.321 --> 00:53:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Then you can really walk our way because</v>
<v Speaker 1>are a beach with Jesus,</v>

1146
00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:25.860
<v Speaker 1>do I have to be in the middle of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit?</v>

1147
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:31.850
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start in this ritualized way where </v>

1148
00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:33.450
<v Speaker 1>they start talking sheet and so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost set your clock is like,</v>

1149
00:53:33.451 --> 00:53:35.700
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're two minutes away from the fight.</v>

1150
00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:40.790
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they are going through their </v>

1151
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:41.280
<v Speaker 1>dances that they're going to push that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to throw down.</v>

1152
00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:46.850
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I was talking with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these guys from quote unquote the </v>

1153
00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:47.760
<v Speaker 1>other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming that I was with one side but.</v>

1154
00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:50.750
<v Speaker 1>And My vibe with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1155
00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:52.830
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we really want to do this,</v>

1156
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:54.270
<v Speaker 1>okay fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's do this.</v>

1157
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:58.200
<v Speaker 1>But honestly I was thinking I had a date</v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>

1158
00:53:58.201 --> 00:54:01.080
<v Speaker 1>I want to go out with this woman or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gondola to a movie.</v>

1159
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:05.790
<v Speaker 1>I kind of rather do that than these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

1160
00:54:05.791 --> 00:54:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>

1161
00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:08.310
<v Speaker 1>You guys have nothing better to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if we,</v>

1162
00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:09.650
<v Speaker 1>if we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's fucking do it.</v>

1163
00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:13.530
<v Speaker 1>You guys just sitting there having these</v>
<v Speaker 1>long sit down,</v>

1164
00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 1>have a coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little spaghetti,</v>

1165
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:20.360
<v Speaker 1>and it was largest because we tie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two main guys were kind of building </v>

1166
00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:20.730
<v Speaker 1>it up and by the time they turned </v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

1167
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.230
<v Speaker 1>nobody wanted to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

1168
00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

1169
00:54:23.461 --> 00:54:25.410
<v Speaker 1>I kind of want to do this other fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

1170
00:54:25.411 --> 00:54:28.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like they said it will lift</v>
<v Speaker 1>their shirt.</v>

1171
00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.030
<v Speaker 1>They achieved that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there like,</v>

1172
00:54:30.031 --> 00:54:32.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you're right.</v>

1173
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would change.</v>

1174
00:54:34.651 --> 00:54:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1175
00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody has guns,</v>

1176
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:39.560
<v Speaker 1>so it's a chain fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

1177
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when know I didn't get to.</v>

1178
00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:45.770
<v Speaker 1>I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1179
00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.450
<v Speaker 1>that was one of my better days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's a fire,</v>

1180
00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I played it because if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1181
00:54:49.711 --> 00:54:52.050
<v Speaker 1>if you showed too much fear then you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>squashed,</v>

1182
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.690
<v Speaker 1>but if you show too much aggressiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you invite the fight.</v>

1183
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.270
<v Speaker 1>There's also a natural thing when groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>of men meet.</v>

1184
00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:02.010
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like it's a tribal thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in our DNA back to when you would</v>

1185
00:55:02.011 --> 00:55:07.011
<v Speaker 1>run into people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in the field and it would turn into </v>

1186
00:55:07.081 --> 00:55:12.081
<v Speaker 1>a war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like almost like an instinctive bonding </v>

1187
00:55:12.081 --> 00:55:14.391
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's where like because a </v>

1188
00:55:14.391 --> 00:55:17.271
<v Speaker 1>lot of the most heinous atrocities that </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings have ever created or a </v>

1189
00:55:17.271 --> 00:55:20.670
<v Speaker 1>committed rather they've committed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the process of war right now.</v>

1190
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Let me say that during the process of </v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

1191
00:55:22.361 --> 00:55:27.361
<v Speaker 1>like people are capable of horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying things that they would never </v>

1192
00:55:27.361 --> 00:55:31.671
<v Speaker 1>do ordinarily and then also they say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you have like this mob </v>

1193
00:55:32.701 --> 00:55:37.701
<v Speaker 1>mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people will do things like gang </v>

1194
00:55:37.701 --> 00:55:38.760
<v Speaker 1>rapes or gang murders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gang beatings,</v>

1195
00:55:38.761 --> 00:55:39.930
<v Speaker 1>lootings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lighting,</v>

1196
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:45.230
<v Speaker 1>places on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the behavior escalates to this </v>

1197
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:46.060
<v Speaker 1>really like insane place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1198
00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:51.380
<v Speaker 1>That is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rare for someone to go to on their </v>

1199
00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:54.591
<v Speaker 1>own as an individual and I wonder if </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ingrained in us because of this </v>

1200
00:55:55.320 --> 00:56:00.320
<v Speaker 1>long history of war in the human race </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you get a bunch of men </v>

1201
00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:01.830
<v Speaker 1>together and a bunch of men on the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>side,</v>

1202
00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:05.520
<v Speaker 1>we just immediately go to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>scorched earth.</v>

1203
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:10.870
<v Speaker 1>It's immediately cutting off heads and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lighting bodies on fire and catapulting </v>

1204
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:12.850
<v Speaker 1>them onto rooftops and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1205
00:56:12.851 --> 00:56:14.390
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you went to these three.</v>

1206
00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Does it read like game of thrones is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fictionalized docomo.</v>

1207
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:23.190
<v Speaker 1>It's just that some dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon,</v>

1208
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:26.170
<v Speaker 1>but other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just most of human history has been</v>

1209
00:56:26.171 --> 00:56:31.171
<v Speaker 1>like that and then you get into those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things where maybe you don't want to </v>

1210
00:56:31.171 --> 00:56:32.050
<v Speaker 1>start by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember remembered those fuckers.</v>

1211
00:56:32.051 --> 00:56:37.051
<v Speaker 1>They got little johnny the other time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they burned the and so now you're </v>

1212
00:56:37.051 --> 00:56:38.370
<v Speaker 1>feeling to get them back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1213
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Then it never ends because it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other guy started it.</v>

1214
00:56:41.681 --> 00:56:43.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not choosing this game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>

1215
00:56:43.331 --> 00:56:45.850
<v Speaker 1>they started eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they remembered that you did.</v>

1216
00:56:45.851 --> 00:56:48.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like you'll never get out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to explain that to somebody wants.</v>

1217
00:56:48.941 --> 00:56:53.941
<v Speaker 1>When I talking about street fights and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was saying that if you get into a </v>

1218
00:56:53.941 --> 00:56:55.060
<v Speaker 1>fight with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not just getting to fight.</v>

1219
00:56:55.060 --> 00:57:00.060
<v Speaker 1>You're signing a contract that you will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be in conflict with them back and forth </v>

1220
00:57:00.131 --> 00:57:03.220
<v Speaker 1>until it's resolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as simple as you get in a fight</v>

1221
00:57:03.221 --> 00:57:06.610
<v Speaker 1>and it's very rare that people get in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight and then after that fights over,</v>

1222
00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:11.910
<v Speaker 1>like it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We shake hands and walk away even often </v>

1223
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:15.631
<v Speaker 1>in a contest like a Jujitsu match or </v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing mattress and one of those </v>

1224
00:57:15.631 --> 00:57:16.000
<v Speaker 1>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after it's over,</v>

1225
00:57:16.001 --> 00:57:19.300
<v Speaker 1>people were still upset if they lose and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still want to get that guy back.</v>

1226
00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.360
<v Speaker 1>But a fight fight like an actual fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the street fight.</v>

1227
00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this can go on for like the,</v>

1228
00:57:25.570 --> 00:57:26.310
<v Speaker 1>what was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1229
00:57:26.311 --> 00:57:28.570
<v Speaker 1>the famous feud in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1230
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:34.200
<v Speaker 1>the hatfields and mccoys of great too </v>
<v Speaker 1>wacky families killed each other back </v>

1231
00:57:34.721 --> 00:57:38.230
<v Speaker 1>and forth for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just couldn't resolve it.</v>

1232
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Now that's why when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you start is a,</v>

1233
00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:43.790
<v Speaker 1>you'll bet there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1234
00:57:43.840 --> 00:57:47.410
<v Speaker 1>but if you've got to go down that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to go down all out.</v>

1235
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Then you just need to really put an end </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that situation where nobody from the </v>

1236
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.720
<v Speaker 1>other side can come natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then,</v>

1237
00:57:52.721 --> 00:57:54.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior talking genocide,</v>

1238
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:59.400
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly the most pleasant </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution in the world that you want to </v>

1239
00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.970
<v Speaker 1>get into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is that beating somebody</v>

1240
00:58:00.971 --> 00:58:04.180
<v Speaker 1>is only postponing the next fight is </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like more worldwide in world war</v>

1241
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:05.580
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>

1242
00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:11.130
<v Speaker 1>they are mad because they got beat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are reaching for a chance for </v>

1243
00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:13.891
<v Speaker 1>revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fruit Stein de Abby did a jump </v>

1244
00:58:13.891 --> 00:58:13.891
<v Speaker 1>on it because they're pissed off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understandably so.</v>

1245
00:58:13.891 --> 00:58:17.140
<v Speaker 1>So unless it's a resolve in some way </v>
<v Speaker 1>where everybody can take,</v>

1246
00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:18.130
<v Speaker 1>we're done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1247
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:20.890
<v Speaker 1>And we know we're not saying we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy,</v>

1248
00:58:20.891 --> 00:58:22.810
<v Speaker 1>but can we leave with the current </v>
<v Speaker 1>compromise,</v>

1249
00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:25.810
<v Speaker 1>the staff that we reach after to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>the balance of power.</v>

1250
00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Can you live with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it becomes a lot more than.</v>

1251
00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:30.050
<v Speaker 1>That's why World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1252
00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:35.110
<v Speaker 1>damn peanut tone of money into Germany </v>
<v Speaker 1>and much of western new little buddy </v>

1253
00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:38.901
<v Speaker 1>building it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took away that resentment that </v>

1254
00:58:38.901 --> 00:58:41.881
<v Speaker 1>otherwise it would have been there or </v>
<v Speaker 1>like those fuckers who does in this </v>

1255
00:58:41.881 --> 00:58:42.070
<v Speaker 1>situation and it ruined our life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's our why.</v>

1256
00:58:42.071 --> 00:58:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Our economy sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why saying,</v>

1257
00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being extra janitor was in that regard,</v>

1258
00:58:46.661 --> 00:58:51.661
<v Speaker 1>wasn't just janitor was out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>goodness of your heart is because you </v>

1259
00:58:51.661 --> 00:58:54.301
<v Speaker 1>want to make sure you don't fight world </v>
<v Speaker 1>war three years down the road and that </v>

1260
00:58:54.301 --> 00:58:55.780
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good alternative to genocide.</v>

1261
00:58:56.290 --> 00:59:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smart people learned how to negotiate </v>

1262
00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:01.290
<v Speaker 1>their other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna.</v>

1263
00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Let's just work this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's figure out a way,</v>

1264
00:59:02.051 --> 00:59:07.051
<v Speaker 1>a mutually agreeable way where we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk away and have some dignity and </v>

1265
00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:09.850
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating.</v>

1266
00:59:10.290 --> 00:59:15.290
<v Speaker 1>I've had this conversation with Duncan </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants and it was the first time I ever </v>

1267
00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:16.480
<v Speaker 1>thought this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I said that the history of the human</v>

1268
00:59:16.481 --> 00:59:20.060
<v Speaker 1>race is essentially military history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1269
00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.460
<v Speaker 1>I've been obsessed with this thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

1270
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:27.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm next time I chat with Don Carlina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want to bring up and the </v>

1271
00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:29.510
<v Speaker 2>one question I want to ask him is </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly about these.</v>

1272
00:59:29.511 --> 00:59:31.940
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love what Dan does.</v>

1273
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:37.450
<v Speaker 2>I love a lot of history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dig it from so many different angles </v>

1274
00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:40.890
<v Speaker 2>and yet why do we always end up talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about horrible stuff and I do.</v>

1275
00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:45.900
<v Speaker 2>It should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My first two episodes of history and </v>

1276
00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:45.900
<v Speaker 2>fire are all about some nest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1277
00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Sinks and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same shit.</v>

1278
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Why is it the stuff that we remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that the stuff that makes the </v>

1279
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.781
<v Speaker 2>history book is old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the horrible atrocity massacre war set </v>

1280
00:59:57.591 --> 01:00:02.591
<v Speaker 2>people on fire?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it that just we don't do anything </v>

1281
01:00:02.591 --> 01:00:02.750
<v Speaker 2>else or that it doesn't catch our </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention?</v>

1282
01:00:02.751 --> 01:00:07.751
<v Speaker 2>I wish there was a way to also put the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spotlight in history on some more mellow</v>

1283
01:00:07.851 --> 01:00:11.510
<v Speaker 2>aspects of people who figured out ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>to live a good life in the middle of all</v>

1284
01:00:11.511 --> 01:00:14.600
<v Speaker 2>the shit that was going down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems so much of it is,</v>

1285
01:00:14.601 --> 01:00:17.870
<v Speaker 2>as you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all military stuff is all fight war</v>

1286
01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:19.250
<v Speaker 2>explored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other side.</v>

1287
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:23.240
<v Speaker 3>That's really the big events though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1288
01:00:23.241 --> 01:00:25.970
<v Speaker 3>when you look at the history of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>

1289
01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:28.100
<v Speaker 3>what are the events that people talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about?</v>

1290
01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>arguably the whole slavery,</v>

1291
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:35.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arguably that's a war because it's so.</v>

1292
01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:39.200
<v Speaker 3>It's a war on these people's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sovereignty.</v>

1293
01:00:39.201 --> 01:00:44.180
<v Speaker 3>It's a war on their freedom and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a and then a real war breaks out between</v>

1294
01:00:44.181 --> 01:00:49.181
<v Speaker 3>the north and the south,</v>
<v Speaker 3>over the rights to this and then the </v>

1295
01:00:49.181 --> 01:00:51.320
<v Speaker 3>economic aspects of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you look at World War One,</v>

1296
01:00:51.321 --> 01:00:55.250
<v Speaker 3>of course in World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we've got to fight the Nazis and then</v>

1297
01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:59.120
<v Speaker 3>we got freedom and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's the entire country.</v>

1298
01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.540
<v Speaker 3>The history of this country is war and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you go back to Europe.</v>

1299
01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:07.541
<v Speaker 3>All the history of Europe is all war to </v>
<v Speaker 3>none other than figuring out the </v>

1300
01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:09.830
<v Speaker 3>printing press and a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool inventions.</v>

1301
01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:15.400
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the great podcasts that Dan </v>

1302
01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.940
<v Speaker 3>Carlin did on history that's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily about war is riddled with </v>

1303
01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:23.291
<v Speaker 3>violence that prophets of doom about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Martin worry about war,</v>

1304
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:28.160
<v Speaker 3>but it is violent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrific,</v>

1305
01:01:28.610 --> 01:01:31.130
<v Speaker 3>horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing that horrific violence,</v>

1306
01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.160
<v Speaker 3>but I think a lot of he's</v>

1307
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:36.270
<v Speaker 2>guessing that acorn because there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a cheap,</v>

1308
01:01:36.271 --> 01:01:40.560
<v Speaker 2>easy way to get people attention and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>most of our history,</v>

1309
01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:43.460
<v Speaker 2>it's an easy way for us to go down that </v>
<v Speaker 2>path and I do it too,</v>

1310
01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:43.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

1311
01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:48.200
<v Speaker 2>I look at 90 percent of the episodes I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>preparing for history and fired up like,</v>

1312
01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:53.750
<v Speaker 2>oh great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said other B had enough days that </v>

1313
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:54.090
<v Speaker 2>it's either and I realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why don't we,</v>

1314
01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:56.520
<v Speaker 2>and I don't mean we as in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in general,</v>

1315
01:01:56.521 --> 01:01:59.460
<v Speaker 2>there's like people who write history </v>
<v Speaker 2>our way of thinking,</v>

1316
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.000
<v Speaker 2>why I'm not denying that part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an important part and we should </v>

1317
01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.481
<v Speaker 2>look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why don't we also look at other </v>

1318
01:02:08.481 --> 01:02:10.521
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like what's wrong with the study </v>

1319
01:02:10.521 --> 01:02:10.521
<v Speaker 2>and about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1320
01:02:10.521 --> 01:02:14.540
<v Speaker 2>putting the accent moron stuff about </v>
<v Speaker 2>people dropping acid and having sex </v>

1321
01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:18.081
<v Speaker 2>outside of marriage a lot more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to cool music and coming out </v>

1322
01:02:18.081 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 2>with Jimi Hendrix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why is that that less than</v>

1323
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>the Cold War?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1324
01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.820
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that just is,</v>

1325
01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean our many people's life as he </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed away a lot,</v>

1326
01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>lot as has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

1327
01:02:30.631 --> 01:02:35.631
<v Speaker 1>sometimes we think was president in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history in most of our lives.</v>

1328
01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Who's president these most mildly </v>
<v Speaker 1>important at most.</v>

1329
01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:44.640
<v Speaker 1>And there are so many other things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>count for so much more.</v>

1330
01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>But why is it that then when we write </v>
<v Speaker 1>the history,</v>

1331
01:02:46.801 --> 01:02:51.801
<v Speaker 1>it's about precedent and our world war </v>
<v Speaker 1>took place when there's so much other </v>

1332
01:02:51.801 --> 01:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>stuff in our lives that count for more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the,</v>

1333
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:59.180
<v Speaker 1>when we were talking about the sixties </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't a big part of the sixties or the </v>

1334
01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam War and the resistance to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam War and that sort of fueled that</v>

1335
01:03:01.951 --> 01:03:05.810
<v Speaker 1>sort of crazy hippie behavior because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they realize that these old assholes and</v>

1336
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:10.820
<v Speaker 1>they're shitty stupid ways I'd led us </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the South Pacific and it's crazy </v>

1337
01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:11.460
<v Speaker 1>war that nobody wanted.</v>

1338
01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big part,</v>

1339
01:03:13.501 --> 01:03:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the rebellion of the 19 sixties.</v>

1340
01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:19.710
<v Speaker 1>It's almost unavoidable because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst thing that can happen.</v>

1341
01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:25.020
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst thing that can happen is </v>

1342
01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:25.020
<v Speaker 1>someone kills you or kills your loved </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>

1343
01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when that happens in mass,</v>

1344
01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in war,</v>

1345
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:32.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that those become the biggest blips on </v>

1346
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:32.990
<v Speaker 1>the social radar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1347
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

1348
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:35.840
<v Speaker 1>So I guess just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1349
01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:40.440
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of seems like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unavoidable,</v>

1350
01:03:41.310 --> 01:03:43.770
<v Speaker 1>unavoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like,</v>

1351
01:03:43.771 --> 01:03:46.380
<v Speaker 1>at least historically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying about for the future,</v>

1352
01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:50.520
<v Speaker 1>but war seemed unavoidable because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was never avoided.</v>

1353
01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1354
01:03:51.211 --> 01:03:55.620
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to argue that war is avoidable</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's never been avoided.</v>

1355
01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:58.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like you kind of at a certain point</v>
<v Speaker 1>in time,</v>

1356
01:03:58.530 --> 01:03:59.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1357
01:03:59.220 --> 01:03:59.520
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1358
01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.800
<v Speaker 1>like if a girl acts like can't all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1359
01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:05.280
<v Speaker 1>she's always screaming and yelling and </v>
<v Speaker 1>clawing and pulling chicks Harris.</v>

1360
01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.190
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a con,</v>

1361
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:11.240
<v Speaker 1>but you're a con every day because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were today,</v>

1362
01:04:12.091 --> 01:04:16.110
<v Speaker 1>you were the day before the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>keyed three people's cars today.</v>

1363
01:04:16.111 --> 01:04:19.520
<v Speaker 1>You threw a fucking bag out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1364
01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:21.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you don't feel that way,</v>

1365
01:04:21.601 --> 01:04:26.020
<v Speaker 1>but the happiness seems to save me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand you.</v>

1366
01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we're.</v>

1367
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.620
<v Speaker 1>People are war like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no we're not.</v>

1368
01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:29.360
<v Speaker 1>We're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1369
01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.120
<v Speaker 1>we're not okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but human history says you're wrong.</v>

1370
01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:36.870
<v Speaker 1>It really does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's not a single moment in time</v>

1371
01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:40.170
<v Speaker 1>in human history where someone somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't killing.</v>

1372
01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1373
01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:46.530
<v Speaker 1>let's look at this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe firmly that if you mean Jamie </v>

1374
01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:50.750
<v Speaker 1>all lived together on an island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would not kill each other if we had </v>

1375
01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:53.820
<v Speaker 1>plenty of food and we didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't argue over resources.</v>

1376
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:59.030
<v Speaker 1>We got along great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we would kill each other </v>

1377
01:04:59.030 --> 01:04:59.030
<v Speaker 1>assuming that there are at least three </v>
<v Speaker 1>women there.</v>

1378
01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.550
<v Speaker 1>At least one girl that's got a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>endurance.</v>

1379
01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:07.020
<v Speaker 1>That could work as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could also do it,</v>

1380
01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:09.530
<v Speaker 1>but even if there wasn't right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just went,</v>

1381
01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:11.640
<v Speaker 1>jerked off in bushes for the rest of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

1382
01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.490
<v Speaker 1>If you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would say,</v>

1383
01:05:14.491 --> 01:05:17.010
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the odds of us killing each other or</v>

1384
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.980
<v Speaker 3>extremely small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if there was only three of us on the </v>

1385
01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:22.980
<v Speaker 3>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there will be no war right there a bit.</v>

1386
01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.320
<v Speaker 3>We'd be no war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as soon as you get more than three,</v>

1387
01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.560
<v Speaker 3>as soon as you get more than 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if there was 10 of us,</v>

1388
01:05:29.561 --> 01:05:31.810
<v Speaker 3>it was 10 of us will live on an island.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

1389
01:05:31.811 --> 01:05:34.080
<v Speaker 3>The odds of somebody getting jacked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

1390
01:05:34.110 --> 01:05:35.830
<v Speaker 3>It goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start to,</v>

1391
01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.430
<v Speaker 3>you get to 20.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>

1392
01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.220
<v Speaker 3>Things get weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something could happen.</v>

1393
01:05:39.250 --> 01:05:41.060
<v Speaker 3>Things get weird habit of his 20th </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

1394
01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:44.480
<v Speaker 3>17 are guys and three or woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's going to die at that point.</v>

1395
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:48.670
<v Speaker 3>It's not even a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a number thing,</v>

1396
01:05:48.671 --> 01:05:51.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you get to a certain certain number</v>

1397
01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:56.650
<v Speaker 3>of people and then war becomes </v>
<v Speaker 3>inevitable and there's never been a time</v>

1398
01:05:56.710 --> 01:06:01.710
<v Speaker 3>ever in the history of the human race </v>
<v Speaker 3>where someone somewhere wasn't killing </v>

1399
01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:03.360
<v Speaker 3>somebody is literally never happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1400
01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.570
<v Speaker 3>Not that we know of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1401
01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:09.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and I need to read the Bible and go </v>

1402
01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:11.200
<v Speaker 3>back to the time of Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Adam and eve never did anything.</v>

1403
01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:11.890
<v Speaker 3>Do we?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There they were.</v>

1404
01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.540
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a certain point in time </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you,</v>

1405
01:06:15.541 --> 01:06:20.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go back and people were essentially </v>

1406
01:06:20.541 --> 01:06:23.071
<v Speaker 3>dealing with predators and that might've</v>
<v Speaker 3>been the only time where we're killing </v>

1407
01:06:23.071 --> 01:06:23.071
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1408
01:06:23.071 --> 01:06:24.460
<v Speaker 3>We're just constantly worried about </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting eaten.</v>

1409
01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1410
01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:30.850
<v Speaker 3>But even then like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like giraffes kill each other,</v>

1411
01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:34.230
<v Speaker 3>like I didn't know until this year that </v>
<v Speaker 3>giraffes kill each other and all that.</v>

1412
01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:35.940
<v Speaker 3>I just found out now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1413
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:39.520
<v Speaker 3>you got to see the way they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do pd each other with their necks.</v>

1414
01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:43.060
<v Speaker 3>They use their head like a whip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know those,</v>

1415
01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:45.730
<v Speaker 3>those weird knobs that they have on </v>
<v Speaker 3>their heads.</v>

1416
01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:47.800
<v Speaker 3>They whip each other with those things.</v>

1417
01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:50.940
<v Speaker 3>They use their head like literally like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a whip and they.</v>

1418
01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:53.440
<v Speaker 3>It's the weirdest thing to pull that </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit up.</v>

1419
01:06:53.441 --> 01:06:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They beat.</v>

1420
01:06:54.700 --> 01:06:57.920
<v Speaker 3>They beat each other to death though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like commonly beat each other.</v>

1421
01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:01.060
<v Speaker 3>Zf jobs wound healed until I started </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>

1422
01:07:01.061 --> 01:07:02.980
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know that deer's kill each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other all the time.</v>

1423
01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:07.210
<v Speaker 3>They stab each other all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fucking horrible.</v>

1424
01:07:07.211 --> 01:07:11.380
<v Speaker 3>It's dog eat dog world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You imagine you grow swords on your head</v>

1425
01:07:11.381 --> 01:07:13.030
<v Speaker 3>and just running around stabbing each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

1426
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.800
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But giraffes,</v>

1427
01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:17.440
<v Speaker 3>it's so odd to do it because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>whipping thing.</v>

1428
01:07:17.441 --> 01:07:18.220
<v Speaker 3>Look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See?</v>

1429
01:07:18.221 --> 01:07:19.510
<v Speaker 3>They whip each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>

1430
01:07:21.130 --> 01:07:26.130
<v Speaker 3>Look at this thing saying they stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>side decide and they push on each other </v>

1431
01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:27.310
<v Speaker 3>and then they whip each other with their</v>
<v Speaker 3>heads.</v>

1432
01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.650
<v Speaker 3>What have you seen q right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1433
01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:31.210
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought they'd do.</v>

1434
01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:33.430
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it sped up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

1435
01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:35.650
<v Speaker 3>is it sped up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1436
01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:37.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not sped up.</v>

1437
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:38.980
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is sped up that up.</v>

1438
01:07:39.290 --> 01:07:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1439
01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:43.600
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not sped up.</v>

1440
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:45.460
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one's not sped up.</v>

1441
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:50.490
<v Speaker 3>That's more realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the first one in the video </v>

1442
01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:50.970
<v Speaker 3>series of direct,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the name of this video?</v>

1443
01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:55.270
<v Speaker 3>A giraffes fighting draft battles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they.</v>

1444
01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:58.390
<v Speaker 3>They always do it the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go side to side.</v>

1445
01:07:58.590 --> 01:08:03.590
<v Speaker 3>She was like two dudes standing shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 3>to shoulder and then it head butting </v>

1446
01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:04.300
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1447
01:08:04.301 --> 01:08:09.301
<v Speaker 3>It's so strange man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these guys have placed are clean </v>

1448
01:08:09.301 --> 01:08:12.700
<v Speaker 3>chimneys one the previous ones wearing </v>
<v Speaker 3>these side to side walk each other and </v>

1449
01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:14.170
<v Speaker 3>then they take five cycles where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>are thinking about the next,</v>

1450
01:08:14.171 --> 01:08:19.171
<v Speaker 3>but look to get back to the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>position that always get back to the </v>

1451
01:08:19.171 --> 01:08:19.340
<v Speaker 3>shoulder to shoulder position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they clinch up,</v>

1452
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:24.370
<v Speaker 3>it's just to get back to this side by </v>
<v Speaker 3>side position so they can fucking head </v>

1453
01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 3>butting each other.</v>

1454
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:28.040
<v Speaker 3>So strange article or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they use their head.</v>

1455
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:30.320
<v Speaker 3>They used their head to the body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see the attack,</v>

1456
01:08:30.321 --> 01:08:34.010
<v Speaker 3>the body with those antlers that William</v>
<v Speaker 3>like nubs,</v>

1457
01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.500
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they'll go to the same spot over and</v>

1458
01:08:36.501 --> 01:08:38.300
<v Speaker 3>over again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like right to the rib cage.</v>

1459
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:41.510
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Giraffes had actually like deer antlers.</v>

1460
01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.300
<v Speaker 3>They will just go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would,</v>

1461
01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.340
<v Speaker 3>but see if you go to the zoo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would never imagined.</v>

1462
01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:52.370
<v Speaker 3>This takes place now because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cool things about giraffes is that </v>

1463
01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:53.600
<v Speaker 3>they're an animal that's so universally </v>
<v Speaker 3>gentle.</v>

1464
01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:56.060
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That you can have babies feed them.</v>

1465
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Like my daughter when she was two years </v>
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>

1466
01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.360
<v Speaker 3>we let her do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They give you a lettuce and you hold out</v>

1467
01:09:02.361 --> 01:09:05.490
<v Speaker 3>the lettuce and the giraffe comes over </v>
<v Speaker 3>with his crazy tongue.</v>

1468
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:10.500
<v Speaker 3>It's like an arm and they reach out </v>
<v Speaker 3>their tongue and wraps it around the </v>

1469
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:13.391
<v Speaker 3>leaves and it pulls it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're so confident in their </v>

1470
01:09:13.391 --> 01:09:14.750
<v Speaker 3>behavior around people that they let </v>
<v Speaker 3>babies feed them,</v>

1471
01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:18.050
<v Speaker 3>but you get these two motherfuckers </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and they fight over some pussy.</v>

1472
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:20.790
<v Speaker 3>That's what he told her latest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>

1473
01:09:21.650 --> 01:09:23.700
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what the dea,</v>

1474
01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.280
<v Speaker 3>the deer don't fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1475
01:09:25.281 --> 01:09:28.580
<v Speaker 3>deer get together and bachelor groups </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they're not breeding,</v>

1476
01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:31.130
<v Speaker 3>when the run is over and they are and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their buddies,</v>

1477
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:36.610
<v Speaker 3>they're all buddies together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like one of the best ways that </v>

1478
01:09:36.610 --> 01:09:39.670
<v Speaker 3>people hunt them out of the Rut is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>find bachelor groups and then you're </v>

1479
01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:41.210
<v Speaker 3>done with those pitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't even hang out with.</v>

1480
01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:46.450
<v Speaker 3>Soon as they get done fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As soon as they'd done fighting and </v>

1481
01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:46.450
<v Speaker 3>fucking and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just hang out guys,</v>

1482
01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:48.380
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go wander through the countryside.</v>

1483
01:09:48.381 --> 01:09:50.120
<v Speaker 3>It's go camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go hang out,</v>

1484
01:09:50.190 --> 01:09:52.190
<v Speaker 3>tell some stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on guys.</v>

1485
01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.860
<v Speaker 3>I know we stabbed each other a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks ago,</v>

1486
01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:57.020
<v Speaker 3>but that's over bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It survive.</v>

1487
01:09:57.021 --> 01:10:00.530
<v Speaker 3>I survive because they said they heal up</v>
<v Speaker 3>quick too.</v>

1488
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:05.530
<v Speaker 3>That's another bizarre thing about deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they'll stab each other and they put </v>

1489
01:10:05.530 --> 01:10:09.851
<v Speaker 3>these horrible gases in their body and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then like a week later it's completely </v>

1490
01:10:09.851 --> 01:10:11.390
<v Speaker 3>sealed up and they're just walking </v>
<v Speaker 3>around like nothing happened.</v>

1491
01:10:11.391 --> 01:10:13.760
<v Speaker 3>Was vetting power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just they just super,</v>

1492
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:19.030
<v Speaker 3>super high metabolism and probably just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They only live like seven years.</v>

1493
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:24.910
<v Speaker 3>So I think whatever injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have seals up quick because there </v>

1494
01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:29.381
<v Speaker 3>was this video of this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went bow hunting and he missed this </v>

1495
01:10:29.381 --> 01:10:30.050
<v Speaker 3>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He missed a good spot.</v>

1496
01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:30.510
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1497
01:10:30.511 --> 01:10:32.540
<v Speaker 3>he missed the vitals that he hit it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the shoulder,</v>

1498
01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:37.750
<v Speaker 3>so the deer got an arrow in his shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they found the deer a week </v>

1499
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:38.640
<v Speaker 3>later walking around like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just.</v>

1500
01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:40.370
<v Speaker 3>I really narrowed that off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1501
01:10:40.371 --> 01:10:41.830
<v Speaker 3>it fell out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fell off the,</v>

1502
01:10:41.831 --> 01:10:43.790
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hole in the shoulder healed up.</v>

1503
01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:45.530
<v Speaker 3>Just sealed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sealed itself.</v>

1504
01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but achy.</v>

1505
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to just,</v>

1506
01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:49.890
<v Speaker 3>they have to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1507
01:10:49.891 --> 01:10:54.891
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And their worlds to getting stabbed all </v>

1508
01:10:54.891 --> 01:10:57.641
<v Speaker 3>the time by swords of these dudes are </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing on their heads that were </v>

1509
01:10:57.641 --> 01:11:00.730
<v Speaker 3>competing for sex and competing for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That goes back to my point,</v>

1510
01:11:00.731 --> 01:11:03.400
<v Speaker 3>if there were giraffe who curse or </v>
<v Speaker 3>digging,</v>

1511
01:11:03.401 --> 01:11:08.401
<v Speaker 3>are hookers?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy who had said that they get </v>

1512
01:11:08.401 --> 01:11:10.981
<v Speaker 3>along well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The crazy thing about deer is it's not </v>

1513
01:11:10.981 --> 01:11:10.981
<v Speaker 3>about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not just about sex,</v>

1514
01:11:10.981 --> 01:11:13.290
<v Speaker 3>it's literally only about sex one time a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

1515
01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:16.410
<v Speaker 3>You just want to resist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pressure is like,</v>

1516
01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:18.240
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is my one chance man.</v>

1517
01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:20.100
<v Speaker 3>And I only live seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I this,</v>

1518
01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:20.440
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1519
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:23.430
<v Speaker 3>I really everybody live three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four or five at most.</v>

1520
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:25.410
<v Speaker 3>So most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're in my way,</v>

1521
01:11:25.411 --> 01:11:27.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to fucking kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1522
01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:29.790
<v Speaker 3>Most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they freeze to death.</v>

1523
01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.950
<v Speaker 3>They freeze to death or starve to death.</v>

1524
01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:36.950
<v Speaker 3>Like they'll wear their teeth down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing and they can no longer process </v>

1525
01:11:36.950 --> 01:11:37.890
<v Speaker 3>grains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way to go.</v>

1526
01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:42.990
<v Speaker 3>It happens to a lot of deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of people will kill an old </v>

1527
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:45.801
<v Speaker 3>dear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they opened its mouth up and </v>

1528
01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:45.801
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1529
01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:46.260
<v Speaker 3>He would've never made it through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>winter because their teeth are gone.</v>

1530
01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:51.320
<v Speaker 3>They still have a very finite resource </v>
<v Speaker 3>with those teeth and at that point </v>

1531
01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:55.701
<v Speaker 3>you're really doing them a favor because</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a way to go by this little </v>

1532
01:11:55.701 --> 01:11:58.650
<v Speaker 3>starvation that's fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they get even worse.</v>

1533
01:11:58.651 --> 01:12:01.080
<v Speaker 3>They're on their way to getting starved </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the coyotes find them.</v>

1534
01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:06.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're weak and then you'll get eaten </v>

1535
01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:06.140
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1536
01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:07.290
<v Speaker 3>asshole first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how they get you outta.</v>

1537
01:12:08.070 --> 01:12:09.620
<v Speaker 3>There was a thing that I tweeted today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

1538
01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:14.070
<v Speaker 3>you see the thing about there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally a new species that is evolving</v>

1539
01:12:14.071 --> 01:12:14.940
<v Speaker 3>before our eyes.</v>

1540
01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:19.020
<v Speaker 3>It's a mix of coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves and dogs and domestic dogs.</v>

1541
01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:24.300
<v Speaker 3>And that a hybrid of these three is </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly successful and it's like the </v>

1542
01:12:24.570 --> 01:12:29.570
<v Speaker 3>Koi wolves are coyotes and wolves and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've known about them for awhile and </v>

1543
01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:31.830
<v Speaker 3>that's really a fascinating thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's a larger coyote,</v>

1544
01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:36.860
<v Speaker 3>but look at this new species,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new species evolving right before our </v>

1545
01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:39.120
<v Speaker 3>eyes and ultra successful mix of wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes and dogs,</v>

1546
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:43.440
<v Speaker 3>so really interesting article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's an actual.</v>

1547
01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:48.550
<v Speaker 3>Is this from the economist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is actually their mating with each </v>

1548
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:53.301
<v Speaker 3>other and they're creating an actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>species really fast.</v>

1549
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:54.780
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's 3:00</v>

1550
01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:59.780
<v Speaker 3>PM.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The embedding began up to 200 years ago </v>

1551
01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:02.601
<v Speaker 3>is European settlers pushed into </v>
<v Speaker 3>southern Ontario and cleared the </v>

1552
01:13:02.601 --> 01:13:05.961
<v Speaker 3>animals' habitat for farming and killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>a large number of wolves that lived </v>

1553
01:13:05.961 --> 01:13:09.351
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also allowed coyotes to spread from </v>

1554
01:13:09.351 --> 01:13:11.880
<v Speaker 3>the prairies and the white farmers </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought dogs into the region.</v>

1555
01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.880
<v Speaker 3>Over time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves began meeting with their new </v>

1556
01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:19.370
<v Speaker 3>genetically similar neighbors and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>resulting offspring which had been </v>

1557
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:22.580
<v Speaker 3>called the eastern coyote or to some the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coi wolf now number in the millions.</v>

1558
01:13:23.761 --> 01:13:26.340
<v Speaker 3>According to research at North Carolina </v>
<v Speaker 3>State University.</v>

1559
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:28.650
<v Speaker 3>This is really interesting stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1560
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:33.920
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifty five pounds now.</v>

1561
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:37.590
<v Speaker 3>Told no 437.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is cool.</v>

1562
01:13:37.730 --> 01:13:42.730
<v Speaker 3>And an analysis of 437 hybrid animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>found that the coyote DNA dominates its </v>

1563
01:13:44.041 --> 01:13:48.600
<v Speaker 3>genetic makeup with about one 10th of </v>
<v Speaker 3>its DNA from dogs,</v>

1564
01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:53.520
<v Speaker 3>usually from a larger dog such as </v>
<v Speaker 3>Doberman pinchers and German shepherds,</v>

1565
01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:56.130
<v Speaker 3>and a quarter from wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1566
01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:01.400
<v Speaker 3>That's freaky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Began that building size compared to a </v>

1567
01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:01.830
<v Speaker 3>big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1568
01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:02.810
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1569
01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:07.960
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating to think how a species </v>

1570
01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:10.470
<v Speaker 3>evolved in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how did a wolf become a wolf?</v>

1571
01:14:10.471 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did a giraffe become a</v>

1572
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:17.010
<v Speaker 1>giraffe and to see something like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and have a very clear line,</v>

1573
01:14:17.171 --> 01:14:18.390
<v Speaker 1>like a genetic line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1574
01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.950
<v Speaker 1>This is what caused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing stuff,</v>

1575
01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:23.050
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking trippy though.</v>

1576
01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always.</v>

1577
01:14:24.701 --> 01:14:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Would you wonder about if we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

1578
01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:28.080
<v Speaker 1>when you see those Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1579
01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:30.700
<v Speaker 1>you think about wolves and then you some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the dog species today.</v>

1580
01:14:30.701 --> 01:14:32.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did you come about?</v>

1581
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:35.610
<v Speaker 1>You're not suited for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1582
01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:37.420
<v Speaker 1>and they've been doing it for thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years.</v>

1583
01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:42.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a modern dog has been around for </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years and we didn't even </v>

1584
01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.910
<v Speaker 1>know the original origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of speculation.</v>

1585
01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:48.700
<v Speaker 1>They believe that the wolves that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>around human beings,</v>

1586
01:14:48.701 --> 01:14:53.701
<v Speaker 1>they became,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they became different because they </v>

1587
01:14:53.701 --> 01:14:56.461
<v Speaker 1>wanted the people to like them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they became the more successful ones </v>

1588
01:14:56.461 --> 01:14:59.250
<v Speaker 1>that stayed were the ones that are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little more timid and more Beta playful.</v>

1589
01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:05.400
<v Speaker 1>They did a study on Fox is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting study that they highlighted </v>

1590
01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:09.541
<v Speaker 1>in this radio lab podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were talking about genetic </v>

1591
01:15:09.541 --> 01:15:13.220
<v Speaker 1>diversity and genetic diversity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>foxes were,</v>

1592
01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:18.240
<v Speaker 1>they only allowed the foxes that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>timid and um,</v>

1593
01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:24.300
<v Speaker 1>and like more more accepting of human be</v>
<v Speaker 1>human touch and to be around humans they</v>

1594
01:15:25.631 --> 01:15:28.750
<v Speaker 1>only allowed them to live and they sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like bread.</v>

1595
01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Those let those breed with other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And over like 10 years,</v>

1596
01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:38.160
<v Speaker 1>they had completely changed the Fox Dna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had completely changed the point with </v>

1597
01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:38.160
<v Speaker 1>their ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1598
01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.300
<v Speaker 1>we're no longer pointed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They flopped.</v>

1599
01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.400
<v Speaker 1>They didn't stick straight up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They flop.</v>

1600
01:15:42.401 --> 01:15:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Their jaws became more feminine in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

1601
01:15:45.401 --> 01:15:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their color started changing nuts.</v>

1602
01:15:47.410 --> 01:15:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten years.</v>

1603
01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:51.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like generations maybe for folks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's or something.</v>

1604
01:15:51.281 --> 01:15:52.140
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1605
01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean probably more than three </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations because generation isn't </v>

1606
01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:57.300
<v Speaker 1>exactly the entire lifetime.</v>

1607
01:15:57.300 --> 01:15:59.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like how long it takes you to breed</v>
<v Speaker 1>into successful.</v>

1608
01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe might have been a capital offense </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>

1609
01:16:01.451 --> 01:16:02.750
<v Speaker 1>so maybe five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regeneration.</v>

1610
01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1611
01:16:03.851 --> 01:16:04.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1612
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:06.370
<v Speaker 1>five generations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing.</v>

1613
01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're finding now more and</v>

1614
01:16:08.801 --> 01:16:13.801
<v Speaker 1>more the more they study life is it life</v>
<v Speaker 1>can evolve and change and shift and </v>

1615
01:16:13.801 --> 01:16:17.590
<v Speaker 1>adapt incredibly quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my favorite story of that.</v>

1616
01:16:17.591 --> 01:16:22.591
<v Speaker 1>As the Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Congo used to be like a grassland </v>

1617
01:16:22.591 --> 01:16:25.750
<v Speaker 1>savanna and then the climate changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became this really lush rain forest,</v>

1618
01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:29.080
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of these animals that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>like savannah animals,</v>

1619
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:31.150
<v Speaker 1>they got trapped right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are stuck.</v>

1620
01:16:31.151 --> 01:16:36.151
<v Speaker 1>They're stuck inside this rain forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like there's this BBC documentary on </v>

1621
01:16:36.151 --> 01:16:39.040
<v Speaker 1>the Congo and one of the cool things is </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing this swampy,</v>

1622
01:16:39.041 --> 01:16:44.041
<v Speaker 1>crazy rain forest and then seeing these </v>
<v Speaker 1>deer run through the water of the rain </v>

1623
01:16:44.041 --> 01:16:45.370
<v Speaker 1>forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these antelopes and you're like,</v>

1624
01:16:45.610 --> 01:16:50.610
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different supposed to be in grasslands </v>

1625
01:16:50.610 --> 01:16:53.530
<v Speaker 1>and they're just trapped in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>insanely dense rain forest.</v>

1626
01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:57.340
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they change a anything like their habits</v>

1627
01:16:57.341 --> 01:17:02.341
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything about their physical features </v>

1628
01:17:02.341 --> 01:17:02.341
<v Speaker 1>that was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them,</v>

1629
01:17:02.341 --> 01:17:05.290
<v Speaker 1>one of them is called a diker and dikers</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very small antelope,</v>

1630
01:17:05.291 --> 01:17:09.160
<v Speaker 1>but he can swim underwater for up to 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>yards and it eats</v>

1631
01:17:10.990 --> 01:17:12.500
<v Speaker 3>the hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the hell?</v>

1632
01:17:13.570 --> 01:17:18.570
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I would picture a hundred yards </v>

1633
01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:18.570
<v Speaker 3>underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Underwater.</v>

1634
01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:23.320
<v Speaker 3>That's what the fuck it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It became something that adapted to that</v>

1635
01:17:23.601 --> 01:17:26.240
<v Speaker 3>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can eat fish,</v>

1636
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:31.330
<v Speaker 3>but they found that deer eat birds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know that until really </v>

1637
01:17:31.330 --> 01:17:32.630
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the ways they found it,</v>

1638
01:17:32.650 --> 01:17:35.780
<v Speaker 3>it was through camera traps because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1639
01:17:35.781 --> 01:17:37.430
<v Speaker 3>they have these camera,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1640
01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:42.940
<v Speaker 3>these trail cams that people put up when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're hunting and that when they put </v>

1641
01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:47.021
<v Speaker 3>up these trail cams,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the trail cams got more and more </v>

1642
01:17:47.021 --> 01:17:47.330
<v Speaker 3>sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they started using video trail cameras.</v>

1643
01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:51.650
<v Speaker 3>And as the video trail cameras started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get the data back from them.</v>

1644
01:17:51.651 --> 01:17:54.410
<v Speaker 3>They started finding like occasionally </v>
<v Speaker 3>birds,</v>

1645
01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:56.720
<v Speaker 3>like deer would eat ground nesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>birds.</v>

1646
01:17:57.170 --> 01:17:59.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Soda need my Ds and they find,</v>

1647
01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>told me to beat the shit out of each </v>

1648
01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:08.081
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That direct birds that are no </v>

1649
01:18:08.081 --> 01:18:08.081
<v Speaker 3>certainties in life anymore.</v>

1650
01:18:08.081 --> 01:18:09.020
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all evil.</v>

1651
01:18:09.021 --> 01:18:14.021
<v Speaker 3>Those goddamn animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ones that we have anthropomorphize </v>

1652
01:18:14.021 --> 01:18:16.490
<v Speaker 3>these beautiful creatures that exist </v>
<v Speaker 3>solely on the power of love.</v>

1653
01:18:16.810 --> 01:18:17.570
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1654
01:18:17.571 --> 01:18:19.920
<v Speaker 3>There was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did some sort of a,</v>

1655
01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:24.950
<v Speaker 3>a study where they were capturing </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain birds with nets and they had set</v>

1656
01:18:24.951 --> 01:18:29.951
<v Speaker 3>the nets up and the birds around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nets and get caught with the deer would </v>

1657
01:18:29.951 --> 01:18:30.500
<v Speaker 3>just walk right up to the birds and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nuts and just start eating them.</v>

1658
01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:32.810
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just chewing them alive while they're in</v>

1659
01:18:32.811 --> 01:18:37.811
<v Speaker 3>the net.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just so much more to eating a sentiment </v>

1660
01:18:37.811 --> 01:18:40.700
<v Speaker 3>about the era and it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it wasn't like they were just </v>

1661
01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:40.700
<v Speaker 3>testing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like trying that.</v>

1662
01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:42.110
<v Speaker 3>Alec is this food though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just went right to it.</v>

1663
01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:47.400
<v Speaker 3>They like so dear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently eat ground nesting birds all </v>

1664
01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:50.891
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but being at ground nesting bird that </v>

1665
01:18:50.891 --> 01:18:52.250
<v Speaker 3>looks like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let that just bad evolution right there.</v>

1666
01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:53.630
<v Speaker 3>Dog Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life.</v>

1667
01:18:53.670 --> 01:18:57.230
<v Speaker 3>What were you thinking at bird delete on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground.</v>

1668
01:18:57.260 --> 01:19:02.260
<v Speaker 3>That just a bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't you know how to put sticks and </v>

1669
01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:02.260
<v Speaker 3>twigs and the trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You dumb fuck the other.</v>

1670
01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:03.980
<v Speaker 3>That helps a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where I live,</v>

1671
01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:06.610
<v Speaker 3>there's a regular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an older list on a monthly basis.</v>

1672
01:19:06.630 --> 01:19:09.160
<v Speaker 3>There's like some cute with the little </v>
<v Speaker 3>birds,</v>

1673
01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:12.410
<v Speaker 3>Nesting da egg Saracini and devotees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got into hall,</v>

1674
01:19:12.411 --> 01:19:17.411
<v Speaker 3>could regularly come by us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reap the shit out of them and I find </v>

1675
01:19:17.411 --> 01:19:18.890
<v Speaker 3>pieces of birds everywhere and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty nasty.</v>

1676
01:19:19.190 --> 01:19:24.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Tom was sitting out on his </v>

1677
01:19:24.190 --> 01:19:25.310
<v Speaker 3>back porch who was one of the directors </v>
<v Speaker 3>of news radio back in the day.</v>

1678
01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:29.210
<v Speaker 3>Tom's a great guy and he was an in </v>
<v Speaker 3>studio city and he goes,</v>

1679
01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.340
<v Speaker 3>sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had this sort of Georgia accent.</v>

1680
01:19:31.341 --> 01:19:36.341
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting on my porch enjoying my </v>
<v Speaker 3>coffee and I see a dove or some sort of </v>

1681
01:19:37.321 --> 01:19:40.700
<v Speaker 3>a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was a dove sitting on the fence</v>

1682
01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:46.240
<v Speaker 3>and then add a nowhere hot comes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>snatches that Burrito and he goes and </v>

1683
01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:49.550
<v Speaker 3>part of me felt lucky to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1684
01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.380
<v Speaker 3>lucky because that doesn't happen every </v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

1685
01:19:51.381 --> 01:19:55.780
<v Speaker 3>but it also like made you realize like </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard out there for a tough war.</v>

1686
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:59.810
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and birds eat birds.</v>

1687
01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:05.140
<v Speaker 3>That's another fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That diverse thought of that I saw not </v>

1688
01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:06.150
<v Speaker 3>so long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's coming back home and die.</v>

1689
01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:08.280
<v Speaker 3>Yardies bird just yapping</v>

1690
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.170
<v Speaker 1>away just making these crazy noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1691
01:20:10.171 --> 01:20:15.171
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I look up into three and acds one </v>

1692
01:20:15.171 --> 01:20:15.171
<v Speaker 1>burgess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just mad.</v>

1693
01:20:15.171 --> 01:20:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Just going there and then I see that </v>
<v Speaker 1>right next to it,</v>

1694
01:20:17.101 --> 01:20:22.101
<v Speaker 1>like maybe 10 feet away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this hawk that does another </v>

1695
01:20:22.101 --> 01:20:23.160
<v Speaker 1>burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He smiles that look exactly like the one</v>

1696
01:20:23.161 --> 01:20:28.161
<v Speaker 1>that Seattle lean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this one is probably like saying he </v>

1697
01:20:28.161 --> 01:20:28.161
<v Speaker 1>was set off a beach which are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching my wife.</v>

1698
01:20:28.161 --> 01:20:30.090
<v Speaker 1>That's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I was like,</v>

1699
01:20:30.270 --> 01:20:32.730
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a rough life right there.</v>

1700
01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:33.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawks,</v>

1701
01:20:33.661 --> 01:20:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

1702
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets jacked.</v>

1703
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Except I saw youtube a video for </v>
<v Speaker 1>committing suicide by Eagle.</v>

1704
01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:44.520
<v Speaker 1>The site with an eagle's nest and oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a good idea.</v>

1705
01:20:44.521 --> 01:20:49.521
<v Speaker 1>You see these eagle who was just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>minding his business is this big Bald </v>

1706
01:20:49.521 --> 01:20:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then clearly before even the camera,</v>

1707
01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:55.120
<v Speaker 1>because the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess was set on the nest to capture </v>

1708
01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:55.120
<v Speaker 1>whatever was going on there.</v>

1709
01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:56.610
<v Speaker 1>You see these eagle just suddenly see </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1710
01:20:57.090 --> 01:21:02.090
<v Speaker 1>a bus up like ready for the fight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next day you've seen is this hawk </v>

1711
01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:05.811
<v Speaker 1>coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fighting with the ego and it lasts </v>

1712
01:21:05.811 --> 01:21:06.420
<v Speaker 1>about six seconds as they go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go whack,</v>

1713
01:21:06.421 --> 01:21:11.421
<v Speaker 1>whack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just the reap the Hawk to pieces </v>

1714
01:21:11.421 --> 01:21:11.421
<v Speaker 1>because it's like I'm glad you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>told the other birds.</v>

1715
01:21:11.421 --> 01:21:12.990
<v Speaker 1>But an eagle is an eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step away.</v>

1716
01:21:13.310 --> 01:21:15.850
<v Speaker 1>You're beginning to overestimate your </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills.</v>

1717
01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Math got drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1718
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So take on an eagle.</v>

1719
01:21:20.810 --> 01:21:23.220
<v Speaker 1>It's fermented berries or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

1720
01:21:23.221 --> 01:21:24.930
<v Speaker 1>A golden days thinking they are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1721
01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:28.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to show them right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that did not work.</v>

1722
01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:31.110
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that birds fly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>flocks,</v>

1723
01:21:31.111 --> 01:21:36.111
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Canadian geese and ducks and </v>

1724
01:21:36.111 --> 01:21:36.750
<v Speaker 1>sparrows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not the ones that eat meat.</v>

1725
01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:39.210
<v Speaker 1>No meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on your own bitch.</v>

1726
01:21:39.211 --> 01:21:40.350
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1727
01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:45.740
<v Speaker 1>there's probably these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a competition about that flesh.</v>

1728
01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Somebody eating that meat just changes </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole dynamic of the situation.</v>

1729
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:55.550
<v Speaker 1>The ones that eat the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a spicket of which after seeing your </v>

1730
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:56.400
<v Speaker 1>instagram picture of your dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1731
01:21:56.660 --> 01:22:01.660
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be knocking on the Oregon </v>

1732
01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:01.660
<v Speaker 1>side for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

1733
01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had gone to the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to get some,</v>

1734
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:05.640
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a freezer in the back.</v>

1735
01:22:05.641 --> 01:22:07.830
<v Speaker 1>I'll hook you up next time I see you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll bring you some elk stack.</v>

1736
01:22:07.860 --> 01:22:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Be Able to love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll teach you how to cook it too.</v>

1737
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:15.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a little different because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very little fat so you have to cook it </v>

1738
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.430
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The easiest to.</v>

1739
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:17.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you some ground elk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the easiest to cook.</v>

1740
01:22:17.311 --> 01:22:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Like elk burgers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super high protein too.</v>

1741
01:22:19.951 --> 01:22:24.951
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm think it's 22 grams of protein per </v>

1742
01:22:25.291 --> 01:22:28.650
<v Speaker 1>pound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is way more than domestic beef.</v>

1743
01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1744
01:22:29.410 --> 01:22:34.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the highest is elk and the </v>

1745
01:22:34.410 --> 01:22:36.040
<v Speaker 1>second highest is Moose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those are the highest of the,</v>

1746
01:22:36.190 --> 01:22:39.630
<v Speaker 1>that type of animal that you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really delicious.</v>

1747
01:22:39.631 --> 01:22:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Two minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

1748
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:42.840
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good for you too.</v>

1749
01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:47.520
<v Speaker 1>And you don't have to feel guilty about </v>
<v Speaker 1>factory farming and all that other.</v>

1750
01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're to eat meat,</v>

1751
01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:54.290
<v Speaker 1>might as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bad that wild and had a good life </v>

1752
01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:55.110
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know factory farming sucks?</v>

1753
01:22:55.410 --> 01:22:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen an eagle in the wild?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1754
01:22:57.930 --> 01:22:58.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1755
01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Wild to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1756
01:23:00.181 --> 01:23:01.530
<v Speaker 1>When you see one in real life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1757
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:02.730
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is big.</v>

1758
01:23:02.731 --> 01:23:03.630
<v Speaker 1>And South Dakota.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1759
01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:06.130
<v Speaker 1>I've seen South Dakota,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's</v>

1760
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:11.130
<v Speaker 3>a crazy video online from Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have this kid and his whole family is </v>

1761
01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:17.440
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their lawn is covered with bald eagles </v>

1762
01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:20.350
<v Speaker 3>and they were throwing out fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had like some salmon,</v>

1763
01:23:20.351 --> 01:23:24.820
<v Speaker 3>so they had filleted the salmon and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had the bottoms in the ribs and the</v>

1764
01:23:24.821 --> 01:23:25.860
<v Speaker 3>heads and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were,</v>

1765
01:23:26.090 --> 01:23:31.090
<v Speaker 3>they had thrown it out for these eagles </v>
<v Speaker 3>and their fucking lawn is just </v>

1766
01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:35.400
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmed with bald eagles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we like to think of Bald Eagles is </v>

1767
01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:38.110
<v Speaker 3>like spinning something like extremely </v>
<v Speaker 3>endangered and protected.</v>

1768
01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:40.630
<v Speaker 3>Alaska is a different story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Totally different story.</v>

1769
01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.760
<v Speaker 3>They're protected in some places,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1770
01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:44.740
<v Speaker 3>But in Alaska they're not protected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1771
01:23:44.770 --> 01:23:45.910
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to not protect,</v>

1772
01:23:45.911 --> 01:23:47.950
<v Speaker 3>I should say they're endangered in a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of places,</v>

1773
01:23:47.951 --> 01:23:50.050
<v Speaker 3>but they're not in danger and Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're still protected.</v>

1774
01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:50.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1775
01:23:51.050 --> 01:23:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at all these.</v>

1776
01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:53.910
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1777
01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:56.170
<v Speaker 3>So what's the name of this video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

1778
01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:58.780
<v Speaker 3>It says 1:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>PM on a summer night.</v>

1779
01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:00.850
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how was it?</v>

1780
01:24:00.851 --> 01:24:03.020
<v Speaker 3>A summer night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1781
01:24:03.090 --> 01:24:05.230
<v Speaker 3>you can't see the other one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1782
01:24:05.231 --> 01:24:05.980
<v Speaker 3>you and breads.</v>

1783
01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:11.680
<v Speaker 3>It's not night just because it's pm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at all these eagles,</v>

1784
01:24:11.681 --> 01:24:16.681
<v Speaker 3>man in the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the ones that aren't black </v>

1785
01:24:16.681 --> 01:24:18.340
<v Speaker 3>with a white.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the immature ones,</v>

1786
01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:23.860
<v Speaker 3>the young ones and some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes those young ones are fucking </v>

1787
01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:23.860
<v Speaker 3>enormous man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1788
01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:25.510
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to look smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>

1789
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:28.900
<v Speaker 3>Now they're all over this guy's lawn and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1790
01:24:28.901 --> 01:24:33.901
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they throw like these buckets of fish </v>

1791
01:24:33.901 --> 01:24:33.970
<v Speaker 3>out for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have,</v>

1792
01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eagles all over the place up there.</v>

1793
01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>

1794
01:24:37.811 --> 01:24:39.670
<v Speaker 3>We have some eagles still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have Golden Eagles.</v>

1795
01:24:39.730 --> 01:24:40.870
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they still find them,</v>

1796
01:24:41.230 --> 01:24:42.880
<v Speaker 3>but they're just not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>

1797
01:24:42.881 --> 01:24:45.040
<v Speaker 3>not nearly as common as they are up </v>
<v Speaker 3>there in Alaska.</v>

1798
01:24:45.250 --> 01:24:47.650
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's also probably because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a lot of food up there with all the</v>

1799
01:24:47.651 --> 01:24:52.651
<v Speaker 3>salmon salmon runs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just one part of the video.</v>

1800
01:24:54.111 --> 01:24:55.950
<v Speaker 3>This video is pretty long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but see they're,</v>

1801
01:24:55.951 --> 01:24:59.270
<v Speaker 3>they're sitting around waiting for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy to chuck like fish heads.</v>

1802
01:24:59.271 --> 01:24:59.750
<v Speaker 3>For them</v>

1803
01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:07.790
<v Speaker 3>it's just an amazing animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This animal,</v>

1804
01:25:07.791 --> 01:25:12.791
<v Speaker 3>this is flying raptor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That really is probably exactly like </v>

1805
01:25:12.861 --> 01:25:16.970
<v Speaker 3>what the dinosaurs are like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating when they find more and</v>

1806
01:25:16.971 --> 01:25:21.971
<v Speaker 3>more evidence that many dinosaurs had </v>
<v Speaker 3>feathers and you think there's really </v>

1807
01:25:21.971 --> 01:25:26.531
<v Speaker 3>probably not much difference between </v>
<v Speaker 3>some birds like eagles and some </v>

1808
01:25:26.571 --> 01:25:29.120
<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they know that some birds,</v>

1809
01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:34.280
<v Speaker 3>even birds that lived a fairly recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the terror birds,</v>

1810
01:25:35.690 --> 01:25:38.990
<v Speaker 3>they were uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these large flightless six foot,</v>

1811
01:25:38.991 --> 01:25:41.990
<v Speaker 3>seven foot tall birds just going to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the head look at.</v>

1812
01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Should I get that head?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to get that habit,</v>

1813
01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:47.660
<v Speaker 3>that fucking do with camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's thinking about it.</v>

1814
01:25:47.661 --> 01:25:49.700
<v Speaker 3>Look at his little baby steps up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pussy,</v>

1815
01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.790
<v Speaker 3>Pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No head for you.</v>

1816
01:25:52.791 --> 01:25:57.791
<v Speaker 3>Faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swooping in and try to do it is this one</v>

1817
01:25:59.511 --> 01:26:00.740
<v Speaker 3>is more mature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1818
01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:03.110
<v Speaker 3>He's got a little bit more confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jack,</v>

1819
01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.260
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1823
01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:10.490
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1824
01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:15.640
<v Speaker 1>I find the world of nature to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably beautiful and exciting and </v>

1825
01:26:16.521 --> 01:26:18.890
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason,</v>

1826
01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:22.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm way more thrilled by the predators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1827
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:24.890
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I see things like this,</v>

1828
01:26:24.891 --> 01:26:27.860
<v Speaker 1>when I see like raptors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what excites me.</v>

1829
01:26:27.861 --> 01:26:30.560
<v Speaker 1>If I see like some sparrows or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

1830
01:26:30.570 --> 01:26:34.330
<v Speaker 1>this pussy as we kind of related more in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the science of,</v>

1831
01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:39.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as human beings we have hunting and </v>

1832
01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.750
<v Speaker 1>gathering has been 95 percent would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been around a while.</v>

1833
01:26:41.751 --> 01:26:44.160
<v Speaker 1>We did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what has been the norm of,</v>

1834
01:26:44.161 --> 01:26:46.220
<v Speaker 1>for human beings for the longest period </v>
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>

1835
01:26:46.270 --> 01:26:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's just something about </v>

1836
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:52.721
<v Speaker 1>dangerous things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to show you this picture that </v>

1837
01:26:52.721 --> 01:26:54.641
<v Speaker 1>certainly sent me a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This a family friend has um,</v>

1838
01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:58.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens and they caught a bobcat eating</v>

1839
01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:01.090
<v Speaker 1>their chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get this fucker Jamie.</v>

1840
01:27:02.490 --> 01:27:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1841
01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Hold it up to the camera and see if </v>
<v Speaker 1>people could see it.</v>

1842
01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:08.800
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

1843
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:11.780
<v Speaker 1>I think they live in woodland hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1844
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:16.810
<v Speaker 1>They're so far away from here at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's today is that now for the </v>

1845
01:27:16.810 --> 01:27:21.281
<v Speaker 1>longest time I live closer to the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that I'm leaving them kind of close </v>

1846
01:27:21.281 --> 01:27:21.360
<v Speaker 1>to Glendale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the heel,</v>

1847
01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:22.670
<v Speaker 1>subpoena ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all kind of stuff.</v>

1848
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:28.270
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stuff that you'll find running </v>

1849
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:29.000
<v Speaker 1>around in the middle of houses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live everywhere and skunks.</v>

1850
01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:33.380
<v Speaker 1>The other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm yesterday with Katie.</v>

1851
01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Larry's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming back home.</v>

1852
01:27:34.461 --> 01:27:36.620
<v Speaker 1>I was teaching a night class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I come back home.</v>

1853
01:27:36.621 --> 01:27:38.930
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 pm or something.</v>

1854
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:41.030
<v Speaker 1>I arrive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm walking through my garden.</v>

1855
01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:46.070
<v Speaker 1>It's pitch black and just maybe 20 feet </v>
<v Speaker 1>to my right a year or just something </v>

1856
01:27:47.751 --> 01:27:48.860
<v Speaker 1>good out at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1857
01:27:49.190 --> 01:27:54.190
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It completely skipped my rational brain </v>

1858
01:27:54.190 --> 01:27:57.281
<v Speaker 1>that there was no thought in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next thing I hear is this meanare </v>

1859
01:27:57.281 --> 01:27:57.980
<v Speaker 1>heavier growl and I realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh wait,</v>

1860
01:27:57.981 --> 01:27:59.210
<v Speaker 1>that's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's me,</v>

1861
01:27:59.510 --> 01:28:04.370
<v Speaker 1>that whatever other fucking thing was </v>
<v Speaker 1>there I just pissed off.</v>

1862
01:28:04.371 --> 01:28:09.371
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never know because whatever the other </v>

1863
01:28:09.371 --> 01:28:09.371
<v Speaker 1>things was decided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1864
01:28:09.371 --> 01:28:10.670
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking crazy or to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I believe it because I added.</v>

1865
01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:12.620
<v Speaker 1>I honestly don't think he was anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>

1866
01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:17.621
<v Speaker 1>I think he was probably like some piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of record and tried to show that they </v>

1867
01:28:17.621 --> 01:28:17.621
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

1868
01:28:17.621 --> 01:28:18.820
<v Speaker 1>They are not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was anything.</v>

1869
01:28:18.940 --> 01:28:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Koons will fight you though because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have grabbed if they want you to </v>

1870
01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:27.250
<v Speaker 1>come after you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not and they don't because </v>

1871
01:28:27.250 --> 01:28:27.250
<v Speaker 1>they are small so they mind their </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

1872
01:28:27.250 --> 01:28:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Mountain Lion wouldn't and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>rare anyway,</v>

1873
01:28:29.290 --> 01:28:31.160
<v Speaker 1>so it's probably stupid raccoon or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

1874
01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:33.200
<v Speaker 1>You probably got too close to his </v>
<v Speaker 1>garbage stash.</v>

1875
01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.510
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was all trying to.</v>

1876
01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.850
<v Speaker 1>This was a Bobcat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1877
01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:41.060
<v Speaker 1>this fucking crazy mangy looking creepy </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal and like I said,</v>

1878
01:28:41.061 --> 01:28:46.061
<v Speaker 1>this is like real close to where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>studio is and this is a guy had a </v>

1879
01:28:46.061 --> 01:28:50.141
<v Speaker 1>chicken coop and this thing figured out </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to get in his chicken coop and was </v>

1880
01:28:50.141 --> 01:28:52.220
<v Speaker 1>eating one of his chickens and his coop </v>
<v Speaker 1>and found it creepy looking face on that</v>

1881
01:28:52.221 --> 01:28:53.300
<v Speaker 1>fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Out of that.</v>

1882
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:55.960
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a mean bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1883
01:28:55.970 --> 01:28:57.820
<v Speaker 1>he's out there earn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earn his.</v>

1884
01:28:57.830 --> 01:29:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Keep getting any welfare in the form of</v>

1885
01:29:02.410 --> 01:29:04.950
<v Speaker 3>giving him shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how big the bobcat's get.</v>

1886
01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.420
<v Speaker 3>They get like 30 or 40 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1887
01:29:06.421 --> 01:29:07.470
<v Speaker 3>They're pretty big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1888
01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:11.190
<v Speaker 3>But I would imagine arco yacht out this </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger,</v>

1889
01:29:11.490 --> 01:29:14.670
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet coyotes don't fuck with bobcat's.</v>

1890
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:15.840
<v Speaker 3>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1891
01:29:15.870 --> 01:29:20.870
<v Speaker 3>but it's too much work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they probably could kill them if </v>

1892
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:21.360
<v Speaker 3>they got a bunch of them together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it probably tastes like shit.</v>

1893
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:23.350
<v Speaker 3>It's probably like chew in a shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1894
01:29:23.410 --> 01:29:27.480
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no self than this.</v>

1895
01:29:27.490 --> 01:29:30.150
<v Speaker 3>And you know what apparently taste good </v>
<v Speaker 3>is mountain lion.</v>

1896
01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:31.260
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1897
01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:33.780
<v Speaker 3>I know this guy in Colorado and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado,</v>

1898
01:29:33.781 --> 01:29:38.781
<v Speaker 3>they're pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're good about taking care of them </v>

1899
01:29:38.781 --> 01:29:42.411
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have mountain lions seasons and </v>

1900
01:29:42.411 --> 01:29:42.411
<v Speaker 3>they try to keep the populations down </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1901
01:29:42.411 --> 01:29:46.971
<v Speaker 3>some people will argue saying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're killing too many and this and </v>

1902
01:29:46.971 --> 01:29:46.971
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't kill them,</v>

1903
01:29:46.971 --> 01:29:50.370
<v Speaker 3>but there needs to be some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>balance.</v>

1904
01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:55.460
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise they start appearing on </v>
<v Speaker 3>people's lawns and killing peoples out </v>

1905
01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:59.311
<v Speaker 3>and like California has a real problem </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't allow people to hunt </v>

1906
01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:02.400
<v Speaker 3>them and they have a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coyotes are a lot of mountain lions and </v>

1907
01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:03.930
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the reasons where the deer</v>
<v Speaker 3>population in California,</v>

1908
01:30:03.931 --> 01:30:08.931
<v Speaker 3>so low it up of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some people like it that way and </v>

1909
01:30:08.931 --> 01:30:08.931
<v Speaker 3>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's the natural balance,</v>

1910
01:30:08.931 --> 01:30:09.600
<v Speaker 3>really shouldn't have that many deer </v>
<v Speaker 3>round.</v>

1911
01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:14.840
<v Speaker 3>And ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can see that point where it's </v>

1912
01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:18.321
<v Speaker 3>probably better to have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain line than it is a lot of lyme </v>

1913
01:30:18.321 --> 01:30:21.150
<v Speaker 3>disease ticks and a lot of deers </v>
<v Speaker 3>slamming into cars like you do in places</v>

1914
01:30:21.151 --> 01:30:23.160
<v Speaker 3>that don't have high mountain lion </v>
<v Speaker 3>populations,</v>

1915
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:28.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Michigan or something like that </v>

1916
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:29.841
<v Speaker 3>where they have a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm focused on my point that we </v>

1917
01:30:30.601 --> 01:30:31.630
<v Speaker 3>should eat with lion.</v>

1918
01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:32.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they taste good though.</v>

1919
01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:35.400
<v Speaker 3>These guys that I know that hunting in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado and I said,</v>

1920
01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:36.330
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1921
01:30:36.331 --> 01:30:37.650
<v Speaker 3>what does it taste like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

1922
01:30:37.651 --> 01:30:39.750
<v Speaker 3>it's a lot like pork,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pork loin.</v>

1923
01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:42.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you take the backstrap from um,</v>

1924
01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:44.000
<v Speaker 3>outline and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1925
01:30:44.010 --> 01:30:45.480
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the roast,</v>

1926
01:30:45.481 --> 01:30:50.481
<v Speaker 3>it was weird because my solar ray,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that tourists are not excited with you </v>

1927
01:30:50.481 --> 01:30:53.190
<v Speaker 3>think of what do you want to eat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But apparently taste really good.</v>

1928
01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:58.280
<v Speaker 3>They said it tastes really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this one guy that was talking to </v>

1929
01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:58.620
<v Speaker 3>one of his favorite meats said it tastes</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like a pork roast.</v>

1930
01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:00.630
<v Speaker 3>They make it with like a blueberry </v>
<v Speaker 3>sauce.</v>

1931
01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:06.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm a nature school today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found out that she had rafts or cons </v>

1932
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.180
<v Speaker 3>that birds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that of goodness.</v>

1933
01:31:12.020 --> 01:31:14.810
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of things to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>learned here about the wild,</v>

1934
01:31:14.890 --> 01:31:16.540
<v Speaker 3>natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1935
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:18.750
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like I said,</v>

1936
01:31:18.810 --> 01:31:23.810
<v Speaker 3>there's something about the predators </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I find just unbelievably </v>

1937
01:31:23.810 --> 01:31:25.380
<v Speaker 3>fascinating and I think it's because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to,</v>

1938
01:31:25.710 --> 01:31:30.710
<v Speaker 3>they have to be so explosive and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>quick and so dangerous in order to get </v>

1939
01:31:31.770 --> 01:31:33.270
<v Speaker 3>what they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to get.</v>

1940
01:31:33.271 --> 01:31:37.350
<v Speaker 3>They can't just walk around and chew on </v>
<v Speaker 3>grass and like cows.</v>

1941
01:31:37.351 --> 01:31:39.990
<v Speaker 3>Nobody gets excited when they see a cow </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's just,</v>

1942
01:31:40.650 --> 01:31:43.770
<v Speaker 3>even if it wasn't so common,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking boring.</v>

1943
01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:46.950
<v Speaker 3>Like Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're the same.</v>

1944
01:31:46.980 --> 01:31:49.890
<v Speaker 3>But at least they have cool hair </v>
<v Speaker 3>executive.</v>

1945
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:53.910
<v Speaker 3>They make some sounds that are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1946
01:31:54.090 --> 01:31:54.790
<v Speaker 3>battlestar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

1947
01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:59.820
<v Speaker 3>I ended up once in the middle of a herd </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Buffalo in custer state park in South</v>

1948
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.550
<v Speaker 3>Dakota</v>

1949
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:02.160
<v Speaker 2>where I took like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1950
01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:02.890
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1951
01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:07.920
<v Speaker 2>the regular roads that you can take with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the card and they have some dirt roads </v>

1952
01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.430
<v Speaker 2>that you can still take with the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was kind of off the beaten path and</v>

1953
01:32:09.730 --> 01:32:13.240
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden I find myself in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of like probably 300 buffaloes,</v>

1954
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:17.710
<v Speaker 2>so I kind of stopped the car away there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are going everywhere around me.</v>

1955
01:32:17.711 --> 01:32:19.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's like one site to the card,</v>

1956
01:32:19.511 --> 01:32:24.160
<v Speaker 2>the other in front of me behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they are big powerful animals,</v>

1957
01:32:24.161 --> 01:32:25.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see them,</v>

1958
01:32:25.001 --> 01:32:30.001
<v Speaker 2>you're either a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to piss them off because they are </v>

1959
01:32:30.001 --> 01:32:30.001
<v Speaker 2>solid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1960
01:32:30.001 --> 01:32:30.440
<v Speaker 2>they don't mess around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was awesome though.</v>

1961
01:32:30.441 --> 01:32:31.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I figured,</v>

1962
01:32:31.450 --> 01:32:33.100
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys don't want to fuck with me,</v>

1963
01:32:33.101 --> 01:32:35.260
<v Speaker 2>they just want to move around me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't care.</v>

1964
01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:39.280
<v Speaker 2>He was great because you see the cafs </v>
<v Speaker 2>running after they are beautiful.</v>

1965
01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:41.500
<v Speaker 2>They are really also my animals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1966
01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:47.250
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing with all wild species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salar cooler than all the domesticated </v>

1967
01:32:48.311 --> 01:32:53.311
<v Speaker 2>species tend to be dumb Bert and to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot like somebody is going to be food </v>

1968
01:32:53.311 --> 01:32:56.100
<v Speaker 2>anyway while you die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you need to be on.</v>

1969
01:32:56.290 --> 01:32:58.230
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see a dog and you see a coyote,</v>

1970
01:32:58.290 --> 01:33:01.390
<v Speaker 2>they are silent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear them make a damn noise.</v>

1971
01:33:01.391 --> 01:33:02.380
<v Speaker 2>You see them and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1972
01:33:02.410 --> 01:33:03.270
<v Speaker 2>is that a dog?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1973
01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:08.610
<v Speaker 2>30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though he's not a dog because they </v>

1974
01:33:08.610 --> 01:33:08.610
<v Speaker 2>had moved away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1975
01:33:08.610 --> 01:33:09.070
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole different game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was good.</v>

1976
01:33:09.071 --> 01:33:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Dogs are all done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Been happier there.</v>

1977
01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Like who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who will be your the way noisier.</v>

1978
01:33:14.081 --> 01:33:15.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a sneaky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1979
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.750
<v Speaker 2>The wilder version is always so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1980
01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.310
<v Speaker 2>you don't cut it if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not smart in the world,</v>

1981
01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:22.840
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to live.</v>

1982
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:24.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a hard life and they have this like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1983
01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:30.510
<v Speaker 2>this air about them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just trying to catch something </v>

1984
01:33:30.510 --> 01:33:34.570
<v Speaker 2>to sneaking around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first time I saw a coyote was in </v>

1985
01:33:34.570 --> 01:33:36.550
<v Speaker 2>burbank in 1994 when I first moved here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was staying at the Oakwoods,</v>

1986
01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:41.640
<v Speaker 2>the Oakwoods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have these pre furnished </v>

1987
01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:43.771
<v Speaker 2>apartments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I lived and I was driving </v>

1988
01:33:43.771 --> 01:33:46.711
<v Speaker 2>to my place and I saw this dog in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>road and another dog next to him and I </v>

1989
01:33:46.711 --> 01:33:46.711
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

1990
01:33:46.711 --> 01:33:48.830
<v Speaker 2>that's a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized like,</v>

1991
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:50.240
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

1992
01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:55.740
<v Speaker 2>That's a live thing that I'm realizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>those are wild coyotes and they're just </v>

1993
01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:56.040
<v Speaker 2>wandering through Burbank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Oh,</v>

1994
01:33:56.500 --> 01:34:00.430
<v Speaker 2>strange that they can just exist on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>streets.</v>

1995
01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:05.800
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I figured if you lived in the rural </v>

1996
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:08.521
<v Speaker 2>areas you would encounter them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't realize that they had </v>

1997
01:34:08.521 --> 01:34:08.521
<v Speaker 2>actually gone deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

1998
01:34:08.521 --> 01:34:10.300
<v Speaker 2>deep into the cities in search of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>cats and shit.</v>

1999
01:34:10.630 --> 01:34:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Big Time I ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found one in my age in my yard and not</v>

2000
01:34:14.201 --> 01:34:16.480
<v Speaker 2>so long ago and he was getting a bit too</v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable.</v>

2001
01:34:16.481 --> 01:34:19.200
<v Speaker 2>It was just kind of roaming around </v>
<v Speaker 2>around him as like first year like,</v>

2002
01:34:19.201 --> 01:34:20.080
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so cool.</v>

2003
01:34:20.081 --> 01:34:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm seeing these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After awhile you're like,</v>

2004
01:34:21.851 --> 01:34:26.851
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to never get too comfortable in my </v>

2005
01:34:26.851 --> 01:34:27.690
<v Speaker 2>backyard because you have a kid and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>walked out.</v>

2006
01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:30.670
<v Speaker 2>Then the coyotes are moving away and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I realized,</v>

2007
01:34:30.671 --> 01:34:35.671
<v Speaker 2>what the Hell am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm putting a wild animal with his back </v>

2008
01:34:35.671 --> 01:34:35.671
<v Speaker 2>against the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That can be a good idea,</v>

2009
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:38.770
<v Speaker 2>but that was my sweet delusional because</v>
<v Speaker 2>my idea of the fence,</v>

2010
01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:42.360
<v Speaker 2>like I took a look at me and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you call these offense.</v>

2011
01:34:42.370 --> 01:34:45.520
<v Speaker 2>It was like probably a good six foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>fence and he just jumped it in one thing</v>

2012
01:34:45.521 --> 01:34:49.240
<v Speaker 2>without even just said these will keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>out at dog.</v>

2013
01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Those stupid things he will make keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>around but me,</v>

2014
01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:53.980
<v Speaker 2>I got something God's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

2015
01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:55.510
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild animal.</v>

2016
01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Our whole different game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2017
01:34:58.470 --> 01:35:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a coyote killed one of my </v>

2018
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.470
<v Speaker 1>chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot my friends,</v>

2019
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.470
<v Speaker 1>like it was nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

2020
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:07.241
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched him hop the fence with the </v>

2021
01:35:07.241 --> 01:35:07.241
<v Speaker 1>chicken in his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2022
01:35:07.241 --> 01:35:08.180
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was their powerful motherfucker.</v>

2023
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when chickens brewed,</v>

2024
01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:15.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to remove them from their </v>

2025
01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:17.870
<v Speaker 1>regular nest because they'll sit in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nesting box that pull their feathers off</v>

2026
01:35:17.871 --> 01:35:20.960
<v Speaker 1>and they get sick and they can do it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a month and a half at a time.</v>

2027
01:35:20.961 --> 01:35:25.961
<v Speaker 1>So what you gotta do is you got to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>them in a small cage for a couple of </v>

2028
01:35:25.961 --> 01:35:29.051
<v Speaker 1>days where they have to stand on a rail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to clutch and sit on this rail</v>

2029
01:35:29.630 --> 01:35:34.630
<v Speaker 1>and you do that for a couple of days and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'll get over the brooding </v>

2030
01:35:34.630 --> 01:35:35.180
<v Speaker 1>instincts and get normal again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just this cycle because they're not</v>

2031
01:35:35.181 --> 01:35:36.160
<v Speaker 1>having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2032
01:35:36.180 --> 01:35:37.010
<v Speaker 1>is that what it is?</v>

2033
01:35:37.130 --> 01:35:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Because they're not having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you eat an egg.</v>

2034
01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:43.160
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know this until really late in </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

2035
01:35:43.190 --> 01:35:46.610
<v Speaker 1>but an egg at the ready for a new piece </v>
<v Speaker 1>of information or let it go.</v>

2036
01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:49.700
<v Speaker 1>I thought an egg would become a chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how retarded I am.</v>

2037
01:35:49.701 --> 01:35:54.701
<v Speaker 1>I thought the only way that it chicken </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes an egg as if she gets fucked by a </v>

2038
01:35:54.701 --> 01:35:58.511
<v Speaker 1>rooster and then an egg comes out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they sit on the a and it becomes a </v>

2039
01:35:58.511 --> 01:36:01.040
<v Speaker 1>chicken and you just got to get the egg </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the chicken hatches.</v>

2040
01:36:01.041 --> 01:36:02.600
<v Speaker 1>Then you create.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the case.</v>

2041
01:36:02.630 --> 01:36:05.180
<v Speaker 1>That's my understanding of faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So please enlighten me.</v>

2042
01:36:05.181 --> 01:36:10.181
<v Speaker 1>Now they actually lay eggs all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>with no males involved whatsoever.</v>

2043
01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:16.600
<v Speaker 1>So I have 22 chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no males or all females and they </v>

2044
01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:21.221
<v Speaker 1>lay usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not an egg a day at the very least an</v>

2045
01:36:21.261 --> 01:36:22.400
<v Speaker 1>egg every other day close.</v>

2046
01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:26.120
<v Speaker 1>And those eggs will never be chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never.</v>

2047
01:36:26.150 --> 01:36:28.850
<v Speaker 1>So people that are vegetarians that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't eat eggs,</v>

2048
01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:34.600
<v Speaker 1>like you're really silly because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal protein that doesn't hurt </v>

2049
01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:35.300
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These chickens,</v>

2050
01:36:35.301 --> 01:36:36.890
<v Speaker 1>they lay these eggs whether you like it </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>

2051
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:38.500
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't eat them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just rot,</v>

2052
01:36:38.530 --> 01:36:39.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could just,</v>

2053
01:36:39.620 --> 01:36:41.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2054
01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:42.800
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2055
01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:48.100
<v Speaker 1>these chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would take them when they're </v>

2056
01:36:48.100 --> 01:36:49.580
<v Speaker 1>brooding and then I'd put them in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>other box and the other boxes outside of</v>

2057
01:36:49.581 --> 01:36:52.460
<v Speaker 1>their coop and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2058
01:36:52.461 --> 01:36:57.461
<v Speaker 1>fairly secure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this coyote had figured out how to </v>

2059
01:36:57.461 --> 01:37:00.671
<v Speaker 1>tip it over and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got the chicken and he had them in his </v>

2060
01:37:00.671 --> 01:37:04.361
<v Speaker 1>mouth and I watched him hold it in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth and run through my yard with his </v>

2061
01:37:04.361 --> 01:37:04.361
<v Speaker 1>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2062
01:37:04.361 --> 01:37:08.531
<v Speaker 1>this motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I opened the door thinking like </v>

2063
01:37:08.531 --> 01:37:11.321
<v Speaker 1>maybe I would be able to get to him </v>
<v Speaker 1>before he could jump the fence with the </v>

2064
01:37:11.321 --> 01:37:11.321
<v Speaker 1>chicken.</v>

2065
01:37:11.321 --> 01:37:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even close.</v>

2066
01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Just leaped over it like it was nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2067
01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what their ability is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a mountain lion a way crazier.</v>

2068
01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:22.370
<v Speaker 1>They can just do ridiculous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can jump like 12 foot fences.</v>

2069
01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:25.820
<v Speaker 1>That would freak me out in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mountain lion in the fight.</v>

2070
01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:29.180
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have any weapons on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are not a good thing.</v>

2071
01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's scary.</v>

2072
01:37:31.281 --> 01:37:32.630
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ain't scared of Shit.</v>

2073
01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:37.720
<v Speaker 1>There's a video of this guy hiking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's hiking and as he's hiking this </v>

2074
01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:37.720
<v Speaker 1>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just sitting there staring at him,</v>

2075
01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:42.221
<v Speaker 1>watching him and he's on this trail and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he starts making noise and smack and </v>

2076
01:37:42.221 --> 01:37:46.091
<v Speaker 1>sticks against the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like that guy probably came </v>

2077
01:37:46.091 --> 01:37:46.940
<v Speaker 1>super close to getting eaten up and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was smaller,</v>

2078
01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:50.160
<v Speaker 1>especially if it was like a small woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2079
01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a case of not it a few years </v>

2080
01:37:55.480 --> 01:37:56.190
<v Speaker 1>ago and Griffith Park and there was some</v>
<v Speaker 1>lady got eaten</v>

2081
01:37:56.190 --> 01:38:01.170
<v Speaker 3>by a mountain lion while hiking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not surprised they're out there.</v>

2082
01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:03.630
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of them there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2083
01:38:03.631 --> 01:38:05.310
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they track quite a few of them,</v>

2084
01:38:05.311 --> 01:38:10.311
<v Speaker 3>but I guess when it comes to large,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big predators is probably one of the </v>

2085
01:38:11.821 --> 01:38:13.470
<v Speaker 3>best ones to have around because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2086
01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:15.060
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have plenty shit.</v>

2087
01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:16.600
<v Speaker 3>They eat right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2088
01:38:16.601 --> 01:38:18.780
<v Speaker 3>they keep away from people for the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>part.</v>

2089
01:38:19.050 --> 01:38:22.260
<v Speaker 3>But it is weird that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only do we want to help them,</v>

2090
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:24.300
<v Speaker 3>like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're setting up these,</v>

2091
01:38:25.260 --> 01:38:30.260
<v Speaker 3>they're like bridges that go across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highway because one of the ways that </v>

2092
01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:33.561
<v Speaker 3>Mount Lines di is trying to cross the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highway to tried to cross the 101 and </v>

2093
01:38:33.561 --> 01:38:33.561
<v Speaker 3>they get nailed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2094
01:38:33.630 --> 01:38:36.240
<v Speaker 3>I say fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's stupid.</v>

2095
01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:38.670
<v Speaker 3>So stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let her know to cross traffic.</v>

2096
01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:43.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He run into traffic.</v>

2097
01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:49.450
<v Speaker 3>It's not a cat that needs to be around </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2098
01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:51.360
<v Speaker 3>That's nature's way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A thin the herd.</v>

2099
01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.970
<v Speaker 3>I mean selection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a lot of them,</v>

2100
01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:59.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't really need to protect them </v>

2101
01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:00.471
<v Speaker 3>that much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need to spend millions of dollars </v>

2102
01:39:00.471 --> 01:39:00.471
<v Speaker 3>building a bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2103
01:39:00.471 --> 01:39:00.471
<v Speaker 3>How about cleanup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>skid row,</v>

2104
01:39:00.471 --> 01:39:01.620
<v Speaker 3>that will work on those animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There</v>

2105
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:03.390
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2106
01:39:04.190 --> 01:39:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I like to go to big bear because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2107
01:39:05.811 --> 01:39:07.700
<v Speaker 2>he's only four hours away from me or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2108
01:39:07.701 --> 01:39:09.070
<v Speaker 2>but he's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a whole lot.</v>

2109
01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Their environment is beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trees,</v>

2110
01:39:11.210 --> 01:39:16.210
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I like to go out there and the place </v>

2111
01:39:16.210 --> 01:39:18.851
<v Speaker 2>where I usually go the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was chatting with some neighbors and </v>

2112
01:39:18.851 --> 01:39:18.851
<v Speaker 2>they were telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2113
01:39:18.851 --> 01:39:22.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these days bears have stopped coming </v>

2114
01:39:22.821 --> 01:39:22.821
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2115
01:39:22.821 --> 01:39:22.821
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>

2116
01:39:22.821 --> 01:39:27.510
<v Speaker 2>what's up is that coke was a mountain </v>
<v Speaker 2>lion moved into the neighborhood and </v>

2117
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.910
<v Speaker 2>even they are freaked out by him to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the.</v>

2118
01:39:27.930 --> 01:39:32.930
<v Speaker 2>There are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Bayers in big bear or not </v>

2119
01:39:32.930 --> 01:39:32.930
<v Speaker 2>this huge black blackberry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2120
01:39:32.930 --> 01:39:37.450
<v Speaker 2>And appeared to this mountain lion is </v>
<v Speaker 2>extra grass even decided the bears </v>

2121
01:39:37.450 --> 01:39:38.390
<v Speaker 2>decided let's move to a nicer </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>

2122
01:39:38.530 --> 01:39:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so one gangster mountain moved down.</v>

2123
01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:41.270
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2124
01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:45.210
<v Speaker 2>And there's a hiking around and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably 6:00</v>

2125
01:39:45.210 --> 01:39:50.210
<v Speaker 2>PM and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I really want to do this at this </v>

2126
01:39:50.210 --> 01:39:50.370
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This does not seem like the best plan in</v>

2127
01:39:50.371 --> 01:39:53.040
<v Speaker 2>the order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a no way.</v>

2128
01:39:53.050 --> 01:39:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Phones like this too much.</v>

2129
01:39:55.390 --> 01:40:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to go with like fucking four </v>

2130
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:02.260
<v Speaker 3>hockey outfit on maybe football series </v>
<v Speaker 3>ads and some chain mail.</v>

2131
01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:05.770
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to get you though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have things to eat.</v>

2132
01:40:05.771 --> 01:40:08.020
<v Speaker 3>There are plenty of things to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time,</v>

2133
01:40:08.021 --> 01:40:09.520
<v Speaker 3>mountain lions don't want to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything to do with.</v>

2134
01:40:09.521 --> 01:40:14.521
<v Speaker 3>People are sick old ones that they need </v>
<v Speaker 3>food so bad until they're willing to </v>

2135
01:40:14.771 --> 01:40:17.620
<v Speaker 3>take a chance on a person of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part,</v>

2136
01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:22.600
<v Speaker 3>even if you do like the natural </v>
<v Speaker 3>selection process is probably eliminated</v>

2137
01:40:22.601 --> 01:40:25.660
<v Speaker 3>people from their diet because every </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountain lion that chose to eat a person</v>

2138
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:27.040
<v Speaker 3>was killed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2139
01:40:27.070 --> 01:40:30.680
<v Speaker 3>So they somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all,</v>

2140
01:40:30.900 --> 01:40:31.690
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they know,</v>

2141
01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:33.100
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're bipedal,</v>

2142
01:40:33.710 --> 01:40:35.440
<v Speaker 3>but they think they can get away with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2143
01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:40.860
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the is beautiful as they are.</v>

2144
01:40:41.450 --> 01:40:42.730
<v Speaker 3>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

2145
01:40:42.850 --> 01:40:44.920
<v Speaker 3>they're terrifying and they're ferocious</v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything,</v>

2146
01:40:45.340 --> 01:40:50.340
<v Speaker 3>but it would be way more thrilled to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of those than I would to see </v>

2147
01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:53.320
<v Speaker 3>something that doesn't kill things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's weird.</v>

2148
01:40:53.321 --> 01:40:53.650
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2149
01:40:53.660 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 3>and I think</v>

2150
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.920
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to the same thing we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about regarding history.</v>

2151
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Why is it that we're fascinated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and we are,</v>

2152
01:40:59.170 --> 01:41:04.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no denying it and you'd be </v>

2153
01:41:04.170 --> 01:41:04.170
<v Speaker 1>bullshit to pretend no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2154
01:41:04.170 --> 01:41:07.621
<v Speaker 1>I like peace and mellow and I like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see people shake hands and it's like </v>

2155
01:41:07.621 --> 01:41:10.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a beauty to some mellow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful stuff,</v>

2156
01:41:10.150 --> 01:41:12.010
<v Speaker 1>but we dig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like you at.</v>

2157
01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Why do we like fight it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we what it is,</v>

2158
01:41:14.710 --> 01:41:15.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

2159
01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:17.800
<v Speaker 1>that's the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in nature.</v>

2160
01:41:17.801 --> 01:41:19.230
<v Speaker 1>We like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like it.</v>

2161
01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:24.240
<v Speaker 1>Them on half of it is about the conflict</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the wars and it's all about that </v>

2162
01:41:24.881 --> 01:41:28.450
<v Speaker 1>stuff and it's conflict and </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

2163
01:41:28.451 --> 01:41:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Like if you were in the ocean and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw a,</v>

2164
01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:33.730
<v Speaker 1>a big Marlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like wow,</v>

2165
01:41:33.731 --> 01:41:35.590
<v Speaker 1>that'd be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll look at that Marlin.</v>

2166
01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:37.680
<v Speaker 1>But if you saw a shark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat tomorrowland.</v>

2167
01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be way more exciting.</v>

2168
01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:44.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you see if whale whales are cool to </v>

2169
01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:46.891
<v Speaker 1>see their beautiful arc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but killer whale is way cooler than a </v>

2170
01:41:46.891 --> 01:41:48.520
<v Speaker 1>regular way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>

2171
01:41:48.530 --> 01:41:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Something's gonna something exciting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatic is going on shark sharks way </v>

2172
01:41:54.281 --> 01:41:56.500
<v Speaker 1>cooler than a regular fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2173
01:41:56.501 --> 01:41:58.810
<v Speaker 1>There's something about those type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

2174
01:41:58.811 --> 01:42:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Like I would love to go on to Africa and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the safari.</v>

2175
01:42:02.590 --> 01:42:07.590
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for malaria and Ebola </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't for those 57 threesomes would </v>

2176
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:11.620
<v Speaker 1>fucking parasites and all kinds of crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

2177
01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:16.950
<v Speaker 1>I would love to go to Africa just to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the off chance of seeing a alliance </v>

2178
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:20.140
<v Speaker 1>take something down on a safari.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to go and see that.</v>

2179
01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to love to witness that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how often that that takes </v>

2180
01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:28.591
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you go on one of those </v>

2181
01:42:28.591 --> 01:42:28.591
<v Speaker 1>safaris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2182
01:42:28.591 --> 01:42:28.591
<v Speaker 1>how often you actually see something get</v>
<v Speaker 1>jacked.</v>

2183
01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even because just because they are </v>

2184
01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:35.401
<v Speaker 1>hunting doesn't mean they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful because course a bunch of </v>

2185
01:42:35.401 --> 01:42:38.161
<v Speaker 1>times you fail and that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's part of the </v>

2186
01:42:38.161 --> 01:42:40.981
<v Speaker 1>interesting conflict is there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something's going to happen and the two </v>

2187
01:42:40.981 --> 01:42:45.361
<v Speaker 1>sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever the two sites are trying </v>

2188
01:42:45.361 --> 01:42:48.150
<v Speaker 1>opposite seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this conflict of wheel in </v>

2189
01:42:48.150 --> 01:42:48.490
<v Speaker 1>somebodies going to get their way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody isn't.</v>

2190
01:42:48.590 --> 01:42:53.590
<v Speaker 1>So there's that element of excitement </v>
<v Speaker 1>that almost make you want a bath or </v>

2191
01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:53.680
<v Speaker 1>anything like what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's gonna,</v>

2192
01:42:54.020 --> 01:42:57.540
<v Speaker 1>who's gonna step up and lead their a </v>
<v Speaker 1>game and succeed and full.</v>

2193
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:59.170
<v Speaker 1>Was that miserably?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

2194
01:42:59.770 --> 01:43:01.600
<v Speaker 1>it's cool when you watch fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>

2195
01:43:01.601 --> 01:43:02.440
<v Speaker 1>What do you watch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>

2196
01:43:02.441 --> 01:43:04.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should not fight.</v>

2197
01:43:04.270 --> 01:43:08.200
<v Speaker 1>He was the lie on chasing the Gazelle is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Ken the gazelle speed.</v>

2198
01:43:08.410 --> 01:43:12.010
<v Speaker 1>Leave the light on in the dust and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>just leaving pissed off and hungry.</v>

2199
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Or is it going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's that question.</v>

2200
01:43:13.811 --> 01:43:18.811
<v Speaker 1>There is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see how they played their cards </v>

2201
01:43:18.811 --> 01:43:18.811
<v Speaker 1>when life is on the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2202
01:43:18.811 --> 01:43:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that contemplation of how the </v>

2203
01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:25.411
<v Speaker 1>outcome's going to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what was that for whatever reason </v>

2204
01:43:25.411 --> 01:43:27.160
<v Speaker 1>is one of the most compelling things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people can watch.</v>

2205
01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's where were so strange in that </v>

2206
01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:32.280
<v Speaker 1>regard that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2207
01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:35.710
<v Speaker 1>that is like one of the most interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>things for people.</v>

2208
01:43:36.490 --> 01:43:37.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why the Romans,</v>

2209
01:43:38.210 --> 01:43:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean when they were feeding the lions </v>
<v Speaker 1>are Christians.</v>

2210
01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that was all bound.</v>

2211
01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:46.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like to see how long that guy can </v>
<v Speaker 1>last in there.</v>

2212
01:43:46.660 --> 01:43:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Just to check these out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These a nasty story that I did not know </v>

2213
01:43:51.681 --> 01:43:52.310
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2214
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:57.920
<v Speaker 2>So what happened was after they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the beast,</v>

2215
01:43:57.921 --> 01:44:01.730
<v Speaker 2>either fight each other or they'll have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lie on seat Kriesti answer something</v>

2216
01:44:01.731 --> 01:44:06.731
<v Speaker 2>than a typical thing is that after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end of the day when a whole bunch of </v>

2217
01:44:06.731 --> 01:44:07.430
<v Speaker 2>these animals have been killed in one </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight or another,</v>

2218
01:44:08.150 --> 01:44:12.230
<v Speaker 2>the Roman emperors to kind of look cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>and popular with the crowds,</v>

2219
01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:15.590
<v Speaker 2>would then distribute the meat to all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the poor people of Rome.</v>

2220
01:44:15.710 --> 01:44:20.710
<v Speaker 2>So the animals killed India in our then </v>
<v Speaker 2>be eaten by all the poorest people in </v>

2221
01:44:20.710 --> 01:44:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Rome as a Freebie because you're a poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>person and you're more likely than not a</v>

2222
01:44:25.221 --> 01:44:27.410
<v Speaker 2>lot of people in your realm or pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to starving.</v>

2223
01:44:27.411 --> 01:44:30.320
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the times nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get them be thrown away.</v>

2224
01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:33.050
<v Speaker 2>You eat right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat the whole animal.</v>

2225
01:44:33.051 --> 01:44:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Whatever they give you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat it.</v>

2226
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:40.570
<v Speaker 2>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that among other things that </v>

2227
01:44:40.570 --> 01:44:43.430
<v Speaker 2>would end up as we are an exalted in on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the table.</v>

2228
01:44:43.850 --> 01:44:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Sometime you get also the interiors of </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals that have just been eating </v>

2229
01:44:48.850 --> 01:44:52.010
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So through via second hand,</v>

2230
01:44:52.011 --> 01:44:57.011
<v Speaker 2>you're also eating people since you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating stoma contents of a lie on the </v>

2231
01:44:57.011 --> 01:45:01.631
<v Speaker 2>job and got killed in the arena and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>lie and just finished feeding on a </v>

2232
01:45:01.631 --> 01:45:04.800
<v Speaker 2>Christiano.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're having a Lion Christiane </v>

2233
01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:08.440
<v Speaker 2>Burger for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just something you just found </v>

2234
01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:10.100
<v Speaker 2>out about three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four years ago I was doing some research</v>

2235
01:45:10.101 --> 01:45:12.890
<v Speaker 2>on gladiators and games and all of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I was like.</v>

2236
01:45:13.130 --> 01:45:14.460
<v Speaker 2>And I started picking that savings,</v>

2237
01:45:14.980 --> 01:45:16.150
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of sources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2238
01:45:16.151 --> 01:45:17.350
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is not bullshit.</v>

2239
01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:22.380
<v Speaker 1>This is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so is that something they discussed in </v>

2240
01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:24.670
<v Speaker 1>the history texts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they discussed that people would </v>

2241
01:45:24.670 --> 01:45:24.670
<v Speaker 1>talk about accidentally eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are like,</v>

2242
01:45:24.671 --> 01:45:25.660
<v Speaker 1>how would they say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2243
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Essentially they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2244
01:45:26.951 --> 01:45:30.250
<v Speaker 1>people ate the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>

2245
01:45:30.251 --> 01:45:32.470
<v Speaker 1>nothing was thrown away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was.</v>

2246
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:36.660
<v Speaker 1>And I guess I don't know if there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary sources that refer to these that</v>

2247
01:45:36.661 --> 01:45:38.410
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I forget the exact,</v>

2248
01:45:38.411 --> 01:45:39.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smoking guns that say,</v>

2249
01:45:39.791 --> 01:45:41.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what happened.</v>

2250
01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:44.470
<v Speaker 1>But I remember seeing it in an AF </v>
<v Speaker 1>secondary sources to say,</v>

2251
01:45:44.471 --> 01:45:46.120
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something to that story.</v>

2252
01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:47.620
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know there was any history at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

2253
01:45:47.621 --> 01:45:49.570
<v Speaker 1>If people eating lions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2254
01:45:49.571 --> 01:45:54.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean you wouldn't as a choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you are a starving plebe and </v>

2255
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:57.700
<v Speaker 1>enroll was nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the emperor say,</v>

2256
01:45:57.730 --> 01:45:59.200
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a nice guy I am.</v>

2257
01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:03.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving you lie on star Mark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please have fun car.</v>

2258
01:46:03.970 --> 01:46:08.970
<v Speaker 1>It's that is the civilization that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>always point to when we talk about </v>

2259
01:46:08.970 --> 01:46:13.630
<v Speaker 1>excess leading to chaos leading to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>client of civilization.</v>

2260
01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:18.900
<v Speaker 1>We always talk about Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but either the United States way more </v>

2261
01:46:18.900 --> 01:46:21.130
<v Speaker 1>fucked up and decadent than Rome ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

2262
01:46:21.310 --> 01:46:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Except for feeding Christians to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lions.</v>

2263
01:46:23.531 --> 01:46:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other than that,</v>

2264
01:46:25.450 --> 01:46:28.750
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the overall numbers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>death,</v>

2265
01:46:29.410 --> 01:46:34.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of shit that we've done to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment should do.</v>

2266
01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:39.060
<v Speaker 1>We've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that just the sheer number of </v>

2267
01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:39.640
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with 350.</v>

2268
01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Was it somewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three $50 million.</v>

2269
01:46:41.890 --> 01:46:44.080
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2270
01:46:44.081 --> 01:46:49.081
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy that they got to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they were entertaining themselves </v>

2271
01:46:49.081 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 1>by bringing</v>

2272
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:54.270
<v Speaker 2>in gigantic predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how far is Rome from Africa?</v>

2273
01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:55.990
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck did they get lions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2274
01:46:56.020 --> 01:47:01.020
<v Speaker 2>Day will dive a hand thirst trap and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then Dan them I guess a set up a bait on</v>

2275
01:47:03.391 --> 01:47:05.360
<v Speaker 2>something they would like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would fall in,</v>

2276
01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:10.560
<v Speaker 2>in um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a big pete where they can climb it </v>

2277
01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:13.440
<v Speaker 2>every way out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I don't know exactly how they </v>

2278
01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:13.440
<v Speaker 2>get a cage on them and their rapid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2279
01:47:13.770 --> 01:47:16.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure a lot of people died to </v>
<v Speaker 2>provide,</v>

2280
01:47:16.270 --> 01:47:21.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lions for Rome and then you ship </v>

2281
01:47:21.270 --> 01:47:22.860
<v Speaker 2>them by boat through cc Dan they send up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Rome and uh,</v>

2282
01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:28.300
<v Speaker 2>they did to a level that they see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the animal population of North Africa </v>

2283
01:47:28.531 --> 01:47:33.531
<v Speaker 2>changed completely because of the Roman </v>
<v Speaker 2>games because they were killing </v>

2284
01:47:33.531 --> 01:47:35.400
<v Speaker 2>thousands upon thousands of them that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they literally,</v>

2285
01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:38.340
<v Speaker 2>they drove some species extinct in north</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa,</v>

2286
01:47:38.341 --> 01:47:39.270
<v Speaker 2>at least in that part.</v>

2287
01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:40.980
<v Speaker 2>You know what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2288
01:47:40.981 --> 01:47:45.981
<v Speaker 2>That's such a massive scale they want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do for the Games.</v>

2289
01:47:46.230 --> 01:47:49.890
<v Speaker 2>And the Roman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys were setting up to the games.</v>

2290
01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:53.310
<v Speaker 2>They were kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember when pride was on and there was</v>

2291
01:47:53.311 --> 01:47:55.460
<v Speaker 2>those wacky Japanese matchmake he'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted.</v>

2292
01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:57.960
<v Speaker 2>They would have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's throw the 600 pound,</v>

2293
01:47:57.980 --> 01:47:59.650
<v Speaker 2>the Huda case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hundred 50 power.</v>

2294
01:47:59.651 --> 01:48:04.651
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens though is that Robin's </v>

2295
01:48:04.651 --> 01:48:04.651
<v Speaker 2>matchmakers or like Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 2>matchmakers,</v>

2296
01:48:04.651 --> 01:48:05.400
<v Speaker 2>they had those ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2297
01:48:05.401 --> 01:48:08.370
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what happens if we throw at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bar.</v>

2298
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:10.640
<v Speaker 2>Let's see what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's try it.</v>

2299
01:48:10.650 --> 01:48:15.650
<v Speaker 2>We'll do that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was there a conversation like that </v>

2300
01:48:15.650 --> 01:48:16.740
<v Speaker 2>before them or did they invent these </v>
<v Speaker 2>games?</v>

2301
01:48:16.970 --> 01:48:21.970
<v Speaker 2>Put all bleed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gladiatorial stuff was ancient in </v>

2302
01:48:21.970 --> 01:48:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Greece and some people think about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Etruscans as well.</v>

2303
01:48:24.811 --> 01:48:29.811
<v Speaker 2>There may have been some orange in there</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the story about the gladiators </v>

2304
01:48:29.811 --> 01:48:32.991
<v Speaker 2>is that I started out as human sacrifice</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they would do it rather than he </v>

2305
01:48:32.991 --> 01:48:32.991
<v Speaker 2>originally.</v>

2306
01:48:32.991 --> 01:48:37.820
<v Speaker 2>They probably sacrifice somebody on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grave of some important person because </v>

2307
01:48:37.820 --> 01:48:39.060
<v Speaker 2>the idea was that there was feeding the </v>
<v Speaker 2>spirit of the dead.</v>

2308
01:48:40.050 --> 01:48:41.370
<v Speaker 2>Then probably somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2309
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:43.970
<v Speaker 2>how about instead of sacrificing me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give you entertainment,</v>

2310
01:48:43.971 --> 01:48:47.280
<v Speaker 2>so we have a nice big fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the other prisoner of war.</v>

2311
01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:49.130
<v Speaker 2>We go at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of us died.</v>

2312
01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:51.060
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't have to be me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have at least a shot,</v>

2313
01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:56.420
<v Speaker 2>one of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blood will feed the data and the </v>

2314
01:48:56.420 --> 01:48:56.520
<v Speaker 2>other one got to walk over live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We decided bay.</v>

2315
01:48:56.521 --> 01:48:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like we got entertainment on top of</v>

2316
01:48:58.651 --> 01:49:00.590
<v Speaker 2>the sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the popular theories.</v>

2317
01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:04.020
<v Speaker 2>You think it was the prisoners idea or </v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think it was like some.</v>

2318
01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:07.680
<v Speaker 2>I would think they would more likely be </v>
<v Speaker 2>some sadistic rulers idea.</v>

2319
01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:09.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2320
01:49:09.870 --> 01:49:14.130
<v Speaker 2>there's that one sword into the cage.</v>

2321
01:49:14.670 --> 01:49:16.020
<v Speaker 2>That could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>

2322
01:49:16.021 --> 01:49:17.880
<v Speaker 2>if I'm the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about be sacrifice and be like,</v>

2323
01:49:18.090 --> 01:49:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make it fun for you guys </v>

2324
01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:23.090
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he'd be somebody else.</v>

2325
01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:24.840
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2326
01:49:24.841 --> 01:49:29.841
<v Speaker 2>erk is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it started out probably is a religious </v>

2327
01:49:29.841 --> 01:49:29.841
<v Speaker 2>thing and then it evolved into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2328
01:49:29.841 --> 01:49:31.020
<v Speaker 2>this is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's corroded religion.</v>

2329
01:49:31.021 --> 01:49:32.910
<v Speaker 2>But just that sort of a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2330
01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:38.240
<v Speaker 2>well we always point to the decadence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Roman Empire as being like the </v>

2331
01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:38.940
<v Speaker 2>pinnacle of their excess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2332
01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:44.900
<v Speaker 2>That's how we look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you go to Disneyland and you </v>

2333
01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:45.990
<v Speaker 2>see people on scooters everywhere you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>within themselves.</v>

2334
01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:48.460
<v Speaker 2>These gelatinous beanbag</v>

2335
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:51.340
<v Speaker 3>style human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just a Disneyland.</v>

2336
01:49:51.341 --> 01:49:51.790
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've.</v>

2337
01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:57.180
<v Speaker 3>Every time I go there are more scholars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's more and more people just </v>

2338
01:49:57.311 --> 01:49:59.460
<v Speaker 3>getting so big that they can't</v>

2339
01:49:59.470 --> 01:50:00.310
<v Speaker 2>walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2340
01:50:00.311 --> 01:50:05.311
<v Speaker 2>That's make it easier for people weed </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves to that because that's what </v>

2341
01:50:05.311 --> 01:50:08.731
<v Speaker 2>we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's had dairy are one of the reasons </v>

2342
01:50:08.731 --> 01:50:10.080
<v Speaker 2>why I think he's seen thirsting for many</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in the US to study at all.</v>

2343
01:50:10.090 --> 01:50:15.090
<v Speaker 2>When there's this fascination for Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's because of the parallels are not </v>

2344
01:50:15.090 --> 01:50:15.090
<v Speaker 2>that hard to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2345
01:50:15.090 --> 01:50:19.950
<v Speaker 2>you see that super powerful civilization</v>
<v Speaker 2>that keeps growing and growing and power</v>

2346
01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:24.190
<v Speaker 2>and eventually hit the TPN scale off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Access gets more and more.</v>

2347
01:50:24.191 --> 01:50:29.191
<v Speaker 2>People get healthier life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they do get softer and then you are </v>

2348
01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:32.520
<v Speaker 2>getting ready for her to fall in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>face of somebody else.</v>

2349
01:50:32.570 --> 01:50:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Tougher and stronger will come from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>harsher life was gonna.</v>

2350
01:50:35.550 --> 01:50:37.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same stuff as the Roman empire,</v>

2351
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:39.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually,</v>

2352
01:50:39.311 --> 01:50:44.311
<v Speaker 2>stop sending your guys to fight your </v>
<v Speaker 2>wars because I don't want my kids to go </v>

2353
01:50:44.311 --> 01:50:46.030
<v Speaker 2>to are about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we did.</v>

2354
01:50:46.031 --> 01:50:48.990
<v Speaker 2>It's our heritage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't want to do that anymore.</v>

2355
01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Let's hire some poor motherfucker to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight for us.</v>

2356
01:50:52.210 --> 01:50:57.210
<v Speaker 2>In the process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your civilization gets weak until </v>

2357
01:50:57.210 --> 01:50:58.480
<v Speaker 2>eventually the other motherfucker hiding</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to fight for you anymore.</v>

2358
01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:01.330
<v Speaker 2>They turn on you and your civilization </v>
<v Speaker 2>folds.</v>

2359
01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Never learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2360
01:51:04.570 --> 01:51:09.130
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough balance between leaving too</v>
<v Speaker 2>harshly where,</v>

2361
01:51:09.131 --> 01:51:10.690
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll become this war machine,</v>

2362
01:51:10.691 --> 01:51:14.920
<v Speaker 2>but that's a sucky life and leaving to </v>
<v Speaker 2>softly when it's.</v>

2363
01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:18.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a real delicate game and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2364
01:51:18.101 --> 01:51:20.680
<v Speaker 2>it is with your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want sinks,</v>

2365
01:51:20.681 --> 01:51:23.650
<v Speaker 2>easy for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to make every single as easy as</v>

2366
01:51:23.651 --> 01:51:26.170
<v Speaker 2>pleasant as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you make it too easy,</v>

2367
01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:29.710
<v Speaker 2>you throw them into wimps and suites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you make it too hard,</v>

2368
01:51:29.711 --> 01:51:31.120
<v Speaker 2>they'll hate your guts because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2369
01:51:31.121 --> 01:51:33.460
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're needlessly making my life hard.</v>

2370
01:51:33.461 --> 01:51:37.450
<v Speaker 2>So it's like that very delicate game of </v>
<v Speaker 2>making field.</v>

2371
01:51:37.451 --> 01:51:41.140
<v Speaker 2>People love the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving them support Dev when needed,</v>

2372
01:51:41.141 --> 01:51:46.141
<v Speaker 2>but then also teaching them how to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong and does not happen through </v>

2373
01:51:46.141 --> 01:51:50.731
<v Speaker 2>softness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't happen through making </v>

2374
01:51:50.731 --> 01:51:50.731
<v Speaker 2>everything easy for them.</v>

2375
01:51:50.731 --> 01:51:54.190
<v Speaker 3>I've had that conversation many times at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian Cowen where he and I were talking </v>

2376
01:51:54.190 --> 01:51:54.190
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2377
01:51:54.190 --> 01:51:55.310
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2378
01:51:55.770 --> 01:51:58.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian lived very strange life,</v>

2379
01:51:58.340 --> 01:52:00.680
<v Speaker 3>like he went to boarding school for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of the time.</v>

2380
01:52:00.681 --> 01:52:05.240
<v Speaker 3>He grew up all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lived in many different countries and</v>

2381
01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:08.720
<v Speaker 3>we just faced a lot of adversity because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't make friends.</v>

2382
01:52:08.721 --> 01:52:13.721
<v Speaker 3>He was constantly moving and because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's just really interesting guy </v>

2383
01:52:13.721 --> 01:52:16.280
<v Speaker 3>and everyone that we know that's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting had some sort of a fucked up</v>

2384
01:52:16.281 --> 01:52:21.281
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yet we don't want our kids to have </v>

2385
01:52:21.281 --> 01:52:24.260
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want your kid to be </v>

2386
01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:28.871
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess maybe what's that Chinese </v>

2387
01:52:28.871 --> 01:52:29.180
<v Speaker 3>proverb with the curse may you live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

2388
01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:31.550
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's uh,</v>

2389
01:52:32.450 --> 01:52:33.020
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2390
01:52:33.110 --> 01:52:33.440
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2391
01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:38.530
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>create someone or to engineer the life </v>

2392
01:52:38.781 --> 01:52:41.090
<v Speaker 3>of a human being that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a,</v>

2393
01:52:41.120 --> 01:52:46.120
<v Speaker 3>that has character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's got to be ways that you </v>

2394
01:52:46.120 --> 01:52:46.280
<v Speaker 3>could teach through difficult</v>

2395
01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:49.440
<v Speaker 1>tasks or through athletic endeavors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2396
01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:50.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2397
01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:55.450
<v Speaker 1>my life was definitely fucked up up </v>
<v Speaker 1>until the time where I was in high </v>

2398
01:52:55.450 --> 01:52:57.050
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of my,</v>

2399
01:52:57.230 --> 01:53:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I think my real character development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of who I became like the harder </v>

2400
01:53:02.721 --> 01:53:04.790
<v Speaker 1>parts was when I was in a really nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

2401
01:53:05.240 --> 01:53:10.240
<v Speaker 1>I lived in Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a really nice suburb of </v>

2402
01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

2403
01:53:10.311 --> 01:53:12.650
<v Speaker 1>that was when I was doing martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was competing.</v>

2404
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:17.950
<v Speaker 1>So I like consciously or purposely did </v>
<v Speaker 1>something really difficult because that </v>

2405
01:53:20.241 --> 01:53:22.190
<v Speaker 1>was what I was interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't thinking,</v>

2406
01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:24.680
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this difficult thing will make me a real</v>

2407
01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:30.280
<v Speaker 1>interesting man when I grow up and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>will provide me with all this character </v>

2408
01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:30.830
<v Speaker 1>development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>

2409
01:53:30.980 --> 01:53:35.980
<v Speaker 1>that was what I really wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason I was compelled to </v>

2410
01:53:35.980 --> 01:53:38.921
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the byproduct of that was </v>

2411
01:53:38.921 --> 01:53:38.921
<v Speaker 1>developed character.</v>

2412
01:53:38.921 --> 01:53:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop the ability to push myself and </v>

2413
01:53:42.730 --> 01:53:44.831
<v Speaker 1>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I did it without having to go </v>

2414
01:53:44.831 --> 01:53:44.840
<v Speaker 1>through horrible neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

2415
01:53:44.841 --> 01:53:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean people will beat me up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gym,</v>

2416
01:53:47.031 --> 01:53:49.700
<v Speaker 1>but nobody beat me up in the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody robbed me.</v>

2417
01:53:49.701 --> 01:53:54.701
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get shot or stabbed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I developed character in a way </v>

2418
01:53:54.701 --> 01:53:57.500
<v Speaker 1>that's similar to what someone would </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably go through if they went through</v>

2419
01:53:57.730 --> 01:54:02.730
<v Speaker 1>some bad violent times and I think you </v>
<v Speaker 1>nailed it right there because you're </v>

2420
01:54:02.730 --> 01:54:06.491
<v Speaker 1>bidding getting up 17 that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get that because we're </v>

2421
01:54:06.491 --> 01:54:10.670
<v Speaker 1>going to throw you in the street and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fight every day against </v>

2422
01:54:10.670 --> 01:54:10.670
<v Speaker 1>some crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kate's with nice and you survive.</v>

2423
01:54:10.670 --> 01:54:11.240
<v Speaker 1>You are going to be tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2424
01:54:11.241 --> 01:54:14.140
<v Speaker 1>well that's silly though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time he's now let's have</v>

2425
01:54:14.141 --> 01:54:16.880
<v Speaker 1>you shall tear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I think martial arts in that regard</v>

2426
01:54:16.881 --> 01:54:17.420
<v Speaker 1>is perfect.</v>

2427
01:54:17.420 --> 01:54:22.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>combat sports are good age because they </v>

2428
01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:24.191
<v Speaker 1>do teach you toughness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're still within a relatively </v>

2429
01:54:24.191 --> 01:54:25.230
<v Speaker 1>protected environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's gonna pull out the gun on you.</v>

2430
01:54:25.290 --> 01:54:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's going to will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2431
01:54:27.110 --> 01:54:29.080
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough buddies,</v>

2432
01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:32.210
<v Speaker 1>CBLI stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a battle.</v>

2433
01:54:32.211 --> 01:54:34.310
<v Speaker 1>People through the walls and pray for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>

2434
01:54:34.311 --> 01:54:35.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a nice medium.</v>

2435
01:54:35.661 --> 01:54:38.000
<v Speaker 1>And I think the more we make our life </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier,</v>

2436
01:54:38.001 --> 01:54:42.530
<v Speaker 1>which we want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do need to engage in seeing that keep</v>

2437
01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.690
<v Speaker 1>the business alive at least to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

2438
01:54:45.590 --> 01:54:50.240
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be tough the way the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one guy who survive out of 100 was being</v>

2439
01:54:50.241 --> 01:54:53.330
<v Speaker 1>thrown to the wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time you still have that</v>

2440
01:54:53.331 --> 01:54:55.940
<v Speaker 1>muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is now completely gone because you</v>

2441
01:54:55.941 --> 01:55:00.941
<v Speaker 1>are just all about because then now you </v>
<v Speaker 1>end up with people who are very </v>

2442
01:55:00.941 --> 01:55:00.941
<v Speaker 1>pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very nice,</v>

2443
01:55:00.941 --> 01:55:04.070
<v Speaker 1>very sweet and complete Williams and </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a spine and then it's like,</v>

2444
01:55:04.730 --> 01:55:06.080
<v Speaker 1>that's not the solution either.</v>

2445
01:55:06.670 --> 01:55:11.670
<v Speaker 1>They have no resilience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have any experience in </v>

2446
01:55:11.670 --> 01:55:15.400
<v Speaker 1>overcoming difficult situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I oftentimes think about that when I </v>

2447
01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:17.230
<v Speaker 1>think about animals because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have dogs,</v>

2448
01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:21.110
<v Speaker 1>I have cats and my animals have zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2449
01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they would,</v>

2450
01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:25.280
<v Speaker 1>they would kill something if they could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>

2451
01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:30.640
<v Speaker 1>They're not mean at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you see a wild animal or an </v>

2452
01:55:30.651 --> 01:55:35.651
<v Speaker 1>animal that has to get its own food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is so different and the only way </v>

2453
01:55:35.691 --> 01:55:39.560
<v Speaker 1>you can get an animal that's team is you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to provide them with all their food</v>

2454
01:55:39.561 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to bypass all of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural predatory instincts</v>

2455
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.250
<v Speaker 3>that every dog has and every cat has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a way to bypass it.</v>

2456
01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:52.460
<v Speaker 3>You just got to give them steady food </v>
<v Speaker 3>and love steady food and loves food and </v>

2457
01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:56.601
<v Speaker 3>love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in doing that you quote unquote </v>

2458
01:55:56.601 --> 01:55:56.601
<v Speaker 3>domesticate them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2459
01:55:56.601 --> 01:56:00.060
<v Speaker 3>And that's kind of also what's happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>with people.</v>

2460
01:56:00.450 --> 01:56:05.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we're doing with human beings is </v>

2461
01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:07.300
<v Speaker 3>turning people into these fluffy sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>kitty cat type people.</v>

2462
01:56:07.380 --> 01:56:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Exactly where if everything goes wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you find yourself on a deserted </v>

2463
01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:12.480
<v Speaker 3>island,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go feral,</v>

2464
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:18.550
<v Speaker 3>try to figure out a way to survive or </v>
<v Speaker 3>eaten raw mussels and chewing on routes </v>

2465
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:22.350
<v Speaker 3>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is what you've become is</v>

2466
01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:25.050
<v Speaker 3>a domesticated person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2467
01:56:25.051 --> 01:56:28.290
<v Speaker 3>if you ever see like liquid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they catch people,</v>

2468
01:56:28.530 --> 01:56:31.890
<v Speaker 3>they find people that have been like </v>
<v Speaker 3>living in the wild by themselves,</v>

2469
01:56:31.891 --> 01:56:36.180
<v Speaker 3>like it's only been a few times or are </v>
<v Speaker 3>found like actual wild feral people.</v>

2470
01:56:36.181 --> 01:56:39.990
<v Speaker 3>But they represented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they resemble feral animals.</v>

2471
01:56:40.050 --> 01:56:41.340
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of ways</v>

2472
01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:42.920
<v Speaker 2>that's how you survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2473
01:56:42.921 --> 01:56:46.710
<v Speaker 2>it's who does live in the wild and </v>
<v Speaker 2>succeed while Dynamo.</v>

2474
01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:48.230
<v Speaker 2>So human being was going to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2475
01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:49.930
<v Speaker 2>This is going to be along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

2476
01:56:50.140 --> 01:56:55.140
<v Speaker 3>but what we value from people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of what we value is domesticated </v>

2477
01:56:55.140 --> 01:56:58.831
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what I like is people that I go up </v>

2478
01:56:58.831 --> 01:57:01.291
<v Speaker 3>to a hug them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know they're not going to try to bite </v>

2479
01:57:01.291 --> 01:57:01.291
<v Speaker 3>my neck</v>

2480
01:57:01.291 --> 01:57:02.700
<v Speaker 2>to avoid a leader that way as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2481
01:57:02.730 --> 01:57:07.730
<v Speaker 2>I tend to enjoy the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like anything is a balance and </v>

2482
01:57:07.730 --> 01:57:09.510
<v Speaker 2>the balance is not 50 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 90 slash 10,</v>

2483
01:57:09.511 --> 01:57:14.511
<v Speaker 2>but you still need to have a little of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that other side is always that there's </v>

2484
01:57:14.511 --> 01:57:15.180
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you go a hundred zero,</v>

2485
01:57:15.181 --> 01:57:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Daniel really lost something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2486
01:57:16.771 --> 01:57:21.771
<v Speaker 2>It's like where exactly is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>balancing a desirable place where you </v>

2487
01:57:21.771 --> 01:57:25.941
<v Speaker 2>are a strong person by our also pleasant</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sweet and nice and you can do all </v>

2488
01:57:25.941 --> 01:57:30.711
<v Speaker 2>the things that we want in a civilized </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation without you being weak </v>

2489
01:57:30.931 --> 01:57:34.920
<v Speaker 2>because that's the other aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people lack the staff side,</v>

2490
01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:40.460
<v Speaker 2>then I don't buy their and cedar because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you are nice because that's </v>

2491
01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:42.390
<v Speaker 2>the only thing you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have the option not to be</v>

2492
01:57:42.391 --> 01:57:47.391
<v Speaker 2>nice because you don't know how.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what it takes to instead </v>

2493
01:57:47.391 --> 01:57:49.740
<v Speaker 2>step up and be assertive and extra stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have,</v>

2494
01:57:49.950 --> 01:57:54.950
<v Speaker 2>so your niceness is not a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have your cab.</v>

2495
01:57:55.761 --> 01:58:00.761
<v Speaker 2>It shows their belly try is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if somebody doesn't have to be </v>

2496
01:58:01.291 --> 01:58:03.980
<v Speaker 2>that way and chooses to be that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I buy it directly.</v>

2497
01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:05.970
<v Speaker 2>Then is legit because you're choosing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2498
01:58:06.450 --> 01:58:06.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2499
01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:11.800
<v Speaker 3>If someone is generous because they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be generous because they have to be </v>

2500
01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:11.800
<v Speaker 3>generous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2501
01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:12.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a strange,</v>

2502
01:58:12.891 --> 01:58:14.900
<v Speaker 3>fine line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What why I was,</v>

2503
01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:19.960
<v Speaker 3>why I've been focusing on this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with this lately is I've gotten</v>

2504
01:58:21.021 --> 01:58:24.080
<v Speaker 3>this weird idea in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily weird,</v>

2505
01:58:24.081 --> 01:58:29.081
<v Speaker 3>but this inescapable thought about human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings domesticating themselves with </v>

2506
01:58:30.291 --> 01:58:35.291
<v Speaker 3>supermarkets and that Sim supermarkets </v>
<v Speaker 3>are in many ways a lot like serving a </v>

2507
01:58:35.691 --> 01:58:38.590
<v Speaker 3>cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bowl of cat food every day and that in</v>

2508
01:58:38.660 --> 01:58:43.660
<v Speaker 3>removing the equation of having to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>and cut the wheat and pick the </v>

2509
01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:48.440
<v Speaker 3>vegetables and kill the animals that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat and instead just show up the </v>

2510
01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:52.170
<v Speaker 3>supermarket by throwing the cart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That what we've done is we've developed </v>

2511
01:58:52.170 --> 01:58:55.650
<v Speaker 3>a system of domestication and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>supermarket or the fast food restaurant </v>

2512
01:58:55.781 --> 01:59:00.781
<v Speaker 3>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever you're getting your food and a </v>

2513
01:59:00.781 --> 01:59:03.031
<v Speaker 3>lot of ways serves the same purpose that</v>
<v Speaker 3>a master does to a pet and that we were </v>

2514
01:59:03.581 --> 01:59:07.660
<v Speaker 3>slowly domesticating the human animal in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>

2515
01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:11.660
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of parallels there</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's one of the reasons I'll also,</v>

2516
01:59:11.661 --> 01:59:15.250
<v Speaker 3>I think why people get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even people that eat meat when they find</v>

2517
01:59:15.251 --> 01:59:16.410
<v Speaker 3>out that people hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2518
01:59:16.750 --> 01:59:21.750
<v Speaker 3>I think that they're reacting to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>path that they're on and it's a path of </v>

2519
01:59:21.851 --> 01:59:24.100
<v Speaker 3>domestication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's a rational.</v>

2520
01:59:24.101 --> 01:59:27.190
<v Speaker 3>Even if they eat meat and I've had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>most irrational,</v>

2521
01:59:27.191 --> 01:59:30.610
<v Speaker 3>which is people that are strict veggie </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetarians or vegans,</v>

2522
01:59:30.611 --> 01:59:33.910
<v Speaker 3>but they have animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They feed meat to say,</v>

2523
01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:35.960
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't know.</v>

2524
01:59:35.970 --> 01:59:38.380
<v Speaker 3>I know it's a lot of this stuff make no </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

2525
01:59:39.130 --> 01:59:42.910
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the rationalizations,</v>

2526
01:59:42.911 --> 01:59:47.911
<v Speaker 3>I feel like they form such a common </v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern that you almost have to take </v>

2527
01:59:48.011 --> 01:59:53.011
<v Speaker 3>into consideration the fact that those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those rationalizations may in fact be </v>

2528
01:59:53.011 --> 01:59:56.590
<v Speaker 3>natural protective mechanisms for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>domestication process to take place.</v>

2529
01:59:56.640 --> 02:00:01.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that as we become more and </v>

2530
02:00:01.640 --> 02:00:02.170
<v Speaker 3>more peaceful and more and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>civilized,</v>

2531
02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:06.160
<v Speaker 3>like I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think everyone agrees that this is</v>

2532
02:00:06.161 --> 02:00:09.460
<v Speaker 3>probably the safest time for human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings to live ever.</v>

2533
02:00:09.670 --> 02:00:10.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a historian.</v>

2534
02:00:10.631 --> 02:00:12.150
<v Speaker 3>You know a lot about history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2535
02:00:12.510 --> 02:00:14.050
<v Speaker 3>You would probably say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2536
02:00:14.290 --> 02:00:14.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2537
02:00:14.921 --> 02:00:16.870
<v Speaker 3>when you look at so much of human </v>
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>

2538
02:00:16.871 --> 02:00:21.871
<v Speaker 3>there's always the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm over to Hilo are going to come </v>

2539
02:00:21.871 --> 02:00:22.540
<v Speaker 3>up and slow through your family at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>drop of a dime.</v>

2540
02:00:22.570 --> 02:00:27.420
<v Speaker 3>So now the fact that most people in many</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries in the water,</v>

2541
02:00:27.740 --> 02:00:30.310
<v Speaker 3>in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of unique.</v>

2542
02:00:30.550 --> 02:00:31.930
<v Speaker 3>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's awesome.</v>

2543
02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:34.540
<v Speaker 3>It's not something that he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of recorded history,</v>

2544
02:00:34.541 --> 02:00:36.840
<v Speaker 3>you can find evidence of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't find any evidence that.</v>

2545
02:00:36.841 --> 02:00:41.841
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you think about like a cruise </v>

2546
02:00:41.841 --> 02:00:42.130
<v Speaker 3>ship pulling up to your harbor and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of people get out,</v>

2547
02:00:42.131 --> 02:00:46.360
<v Speaker 3>you welcome them now strangers from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>strange land and you're like,</v>

2548
02:00:46.390 --> 02:00:47.290
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is great.</v>

2549
02:00:47.291 --> 02:00:49.240
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come over here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going buy my trinkets.</v>

2550
02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:50.890
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to buy a Poncho,</v>

2551
02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:51.610
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2552
02:00:51.670 --> 02:00:56.670
<v Speaker 3>Whereas at four they were going to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>with fucking swords and kill your </v>

2553
02:00:56.670 --> 02:00:57.820
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you watch the TV series vikings?</v>

2554
02:00:57.970 --> 02:00:58.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

2555
02:00:58.710 --> 02:01:00.000
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty bad us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2556
02:01:00.010 --> 02:01:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

2557
02:01:00.780 --> 02:01:01.090
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2558
02:01:01.230 --> 02:01:03.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never heard anything about it.</v>

2559
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:06.400
<v Speaker 3>Rarely gets good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Photography is awesome.</v>

2560
02:01:06.420 --> 02:01:08.490
<v Speaker 3>This is pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

2561
02:01:08.500 --> 02:01:13.500
<v Speaker 3>And there's these ones scene that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching from the third season where </v>

2562
02:01:13.500 --> 02:01:13.860
<v Speaker 3>there's this critical viking standing </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of batteries.</v>

2563
02:01:13.890 --> 02:01:18.890
<v Speaker 3>So you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seemed the distance though the shape </v>

2564
02:01:18.890 --> 02:01:19.190
<v Speaker 3>and it's beautiful that you see these </v>
<v Speaker 3>pieces.</v>

2565
02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:20.680
<v Speaker 3>DOLLF semi-naked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vikings.</v>

2566
02:01:20.681 --> 02:01:22.870
<v Speaker 3>We put our trust and they are starting </v>
<v Speaker 3>to scream.</v>

2567
02:01:23.470 --> 02:01:25.990
<v Speaker 3>It's acts dive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard to tie,</v>

2568
02:01:25.991 --> 02:01:27.640
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like about a show.</v>

2569
02:01:27.641 --> 02:01:30.540
<v Speaker 3>That's where they're screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's time and its sword time.</v>

2570
02:01:30.630 --> 02:01:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Exactly how it's hammertime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about Hammerton?</v>

2571
02:01:33.110 --> 02:01:33.730
<v Speaker 3>Excited?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2572
02:01:33.731 --> 02:01:36.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm married.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Escaped habitat and the.</v>

2573
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:39.650
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's 30 there.</v>

2574
02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

2575
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:45.070
<v Speaker 1>a lot of human history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that have and people that have </v>

2576
02:01:45.070 --> 02:01:47.381
<v Speaker 1>not and the have nots show up at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gates and they are hungry and they are </v>

2577
02:01:47.381 --> 02:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>more motivated than New Yorkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are hungry.</v>

2578
02:01:49.190 --> 02:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>It is amazing that this is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only times that we've ever recorded </v>

2579
02:01:54.190 --> 02:01:59.171
<v Speaker 1>where people show up in places where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know anybody in their </v>

2580
02:01:59.171 --> 02:01:59.171
<v Speaker 1>welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2581
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:01.360
<v Speaker 1>You're welcome all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2582
02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could.</v>

2583
02:02:01.801 --> 02:02:06.801
<v Speaker 1>He said Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as there are many people who have their </v>

2584
02:02:06.801 --> 02:02:06.801
<v Speaker 1>theory that like way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

2585
02:02:06.801 --> 02:02:09.500
<v Speaker 1>way in a distant past in the hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gathering time,</v>

2586
02:02:09.501 --> 02:02:14.501
<v Speaker 1>people are not more Amandla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was less war and then there's the </v>

2587
02:02:14.501 --> 02:02:14.501
<v Speaker 1>other camp or that argues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2588
02:02:14.501 --> 02:02:15.770
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hunting and gathering tiny store,</v>

2589
02:02:15.790 --> 02:02:18.500
<v Speaker 1>crazy column for the ats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just he didn't tap into it often because</v>

2590
02:02:18.501 --> 02:02:23.501
<v Speaker 1>there were a few people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they don't run into each other that </v>

2591
02:02:23.501 --> 02:02:24.380
<v Speaker 1>much and the reality realities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2592
02:02:24.381 --> 02:02:24.920
<v Speaker 1>is that right?</v>

2593
02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:28.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't think either one is completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>right in the sense that I don't think he</v>

2594
02:02:28.731 --> 02:02:33.731
<v Speaker 1>was at peace and love scenario because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not how human beings operate and </v>

2595
02:02:33.731 --> 02:02:37.451
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was a small deal that </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally states can save you from </v>

2596
02:02:37.451 --> 02:02:39.590
<v Speaker 1>violence because otherwise everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>always killing each other.</v>

2597
02:02:39.591 --> 02:02:42.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily think of that Cedar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but clear.</v>

2598
02:02:42.500 --> 02:02:47.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean we do have evidence that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>bash each other brains forever for a </v>

2599
02:02:47.500 --> 02:02:48.860
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our frequent that was,</v>

2600
02:02:48.861 --> 02:02:53.861
<v Speaker 1>that's the question and there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>different schools of thought in that </v>

2601
02:02:53.861 --> 02:02:54.200
<v Speaker 1>regard and it's kind of hard to come up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We took a glues,</v>

2602
02:02:54.201 --> 02:02:56.750
<v Speaker 1>events are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other than that scenario,</v>

2603
02:02:56.751 --> 02:03:01.751
<v Speaker 1>which is so far in the past that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have solid evidence on for match </v>

2604
02:03:03.021 --> 02:03:05.810
<v Speaker 1>of the history that we do every courts </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2605
02:03:06.230 --> 02:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do nasty shit to each other all </v>

2606
02:03:11.230 --> 02:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2607
02:03:11.230 --> 02:03:12.620
<v Speaker 1>I think Chris is talking about tribal </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures that live,</v>

2608
02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indigenous people that live in the </v>

2609
02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>jungle and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when it's resource dependent,</v>

2610
02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:20.510
<v Speaker 1>I think when there's a lot of resources </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's plenty of women to fuck.</v>

2611
02:03:20.930 --> 02:03:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's.</v>

2612
02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>I Have Ryan also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves those polyamorous society.</v>

2613
02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:27.230
<v Speaker 1>He loves it.</v>

2614
02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves those.</v>

2615
02:03:32.121 --> 02:03:36.080
<v Speaker 1>The concept of these cultures that </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed that didn't have,</v>

2616
02:03:36.910 --> 02:03:39.500
<v Speaker 1>they weren't able to trace lines of male</v>
<v Speaker 1>paternity,</v>

2617
02:03:39.790 --> 02:03:41.960
<v Speaker 1>so the entire villages would raise </v>
<v Speaker 1>children,</v>

2618
02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:45.380
<v Speaker 1>which exists right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is some parts of the world,</v>

2619
02:03:45.381 --> 02:03:46.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

2620
02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:51.080
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how some indigenous cultures </v>

2621
02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:52.130
<v Speaker 1>still operate to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet there's also indigenous cultures</v>

2622
02:03:52.131 --> 02:03:54.560
<v Speaker 1>like the ones in New Guinea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

2623
02:03:54.561 --> 02:03:56.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sperm warriors beginning,</v>

2624
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:57.230
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2625
02:03:57.231 --> 02:03:59.120
<v Speaker 1>that story right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remind me later.</v>

2626
02:03:59.121 --> 02:04:02.710
<v Speaker 1>I know somebody been fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on about some.</v>

2627
02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:04.820
<v Speaker 1>What's up with disparate warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awful,</v>

2628
02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:06.260
<v Speaker 1>awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pedophilia.</v>

2629
02:04:06.290 --> 02:04:11.290
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will take children at a very young </v>

2630
02:04:11.290 --> 02:04:11.660
<v Speaker 1>age and make them consume calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2631
02:04:11.900 --> 02:04:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Both in their ass and in their mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Make God mad.</v>

2632
02:04:14.850 --> 02:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2633
02:04:15.530 --> 02:04:16.630
<v Speaker 1>They call you the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2634
02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:19.610
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leave their parents and go stay with</v>

2635
02:04:19.611 --> 02:04:20.660
<v Speaker 1>what they call their anus.</v>

2636
02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:21.970
<v Speaker 1>Father Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2637
02:04:21.971 --> 02:04:23.390
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

2638
02:04:23.420 --> 02:04:25.080
<v Speaker 1>And they'd been doing this for thousands</v>
<v Speaker 1>of years.</v>

2639
02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:29.240
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This became a style of living.</v>

2640
02:04:29.241 --> 02:04:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Somebody was really into little kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they see the doc,</v>

2641
02:04:34.220 --> 02:04:39.220
<v Speaker 1>the gods have spoken theses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you'll make her yell the message </v>

2642
02:04:39.220 --> 02:04:42.780
<v Speaker 1>from upon high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from now on.</v>

2643
02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:46.080
<v Speaker 1>It's not romanticizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

2644
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:47.880
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonizing,</v>

2645
02:04:47.881 --> 02:04:48.480
<v Speaker 1>get this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2646
02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:50.700
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean these [inaudible] yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dc's fuck it up,</v>

2647
02:04:50.701 --> 02:04:54.930
<v Speaker 1>but I mean tribal culture that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>great stuff there.</v>

2648
02:04:54.931 --> 02:04:57.480
<v Speaker 1>There's all full of stuff there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's human stuff done,</v>

2649
02:04:57.481 --> 02:04:59.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the whole spectrum of it all.</v>

2650
02:04:59.701 --> 02:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>And I do like what chris is doing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of,</v>

2651
02:05:03.090 --> 02:05:06.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a historically 100 percent right in</v>

2652
02:05:06.031 --> 02:05:08.190
<v Speaker 1>that deBate about are cool or not so </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

2653
02:05:08.460 --> 02:05:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Ancient tribal societies were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do like the where is going with in</v>

2654
02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>terms of what these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can learn either from the actual</v>

2655
02:05:17.521 --> 02:05:21.420
<v Speaker 1>history or from something that sound </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool that may not exactly have that bend</v>

2656
02:05:21.421 --> 02:05:26.421
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the gives as an idea because </v>

2657
02:05:26.421 --> 02:05:26.421
<v Speaker 1>ultimately what the fuck cares what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>did 10,000</v>

2658
02:05:26.421 --> 02:05:30.171
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's about what you can do now that </v>

2659
02:05:30.171 --> 02:05:31.230
<v Speaker 1>gives you an idea of what you can do now</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make life better.</v>

2660
02:05:31.560 --> 02:05:33.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't care whether it really happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>

2661
02:05:33.391 --> 02:05:35.340
<v Speaker 1>If it makes life better now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy.</v>

2662
02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:36.720
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>

2663
02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:38.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

2664
02:05:38.730 --> 02:05:40.170
<v Speaker 1>What is possible now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2665
02:05:40.490 --> 02:05:43.440
<v Speaker 1>and I firmly believe now is the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>time ever.</v>

2666
02:05:43.530 --> 02:05:48.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're incredibly lucky to live </v>

2667
02:05:48.530 --> 02:05:50.271
<v Speaker 1>right now and as long as we don't hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a natural disaster or </v>

2668
02:05:50.271 --> 02:05:53.010
<v Speaker 1>someone fucks up and accidentally starts</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nuclear war,</v>

2669
02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:55.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a great time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not perfect,</v>

2670
02:05:55.891 --> 02:05:58.170
<v Speaker 1>but there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing going to be perfect.</v>

2671
02:05:58.171 --> 02:06:01.380
<v Speaker 1>It's what we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the sheer numbers of humans.</v>

2672
02:06:01.710 --> 02:06:03.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 people on an eye with three girls.</v>

2673
02:06:04.110 --> 02:06:05.670
<v Speaker 1>17 men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have death.</v>

2674
02:06:05.770 --> 02:06:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Akiva,</v>

2675
02:06:07.950 --> 02:06:10.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think one night goes by without </v>
<v Speaker 1>you here.</v>

2676
02:06:10.890 --> 02:06:14.610
<v Speaker 1>China recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they changed their one child that day.</v>

2677
02:06:14.700 --> 02:06:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when?</v>

2678
02:06:16.030 --> 02:06:17.160
<v Speaker 1>The last few days.</v>

2679
02:06:17.370 --> 02:06:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2680
02:06:18.930 --> 02:06:21.360
<v Speaker 1>That can go both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean on one end you,</v>

2681
02:06:21.390 --> 02:06:24.430
<v Speaker 1>the whole female fantasize was fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other end,</v>

2682
02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:29.480
<v Speaker 1>a China growing dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Population that's not exactly a good </v>

2683
02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:33.370
<v Speaker 1>thing gator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are they going to do it because </v>

2684
02:06:33.370 --> 02:06:33.370
<v Speaker 1>there's only like 15 girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2685
02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:38.480
<v Speaker 1>I guess actually fucked up this idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would only have men because the</v>

2686
02:06:39.181 --> 02:06:41.760
<v Speaker 1>men would be able to take care of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you,</v>

2687
02:06:41.820 --> 02:06:45.960
<v Speaker 1>you guys threw a monkey wrench in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole generation.</v>

2688
02:06:46.010 --> 02:06:47.010
<v Speaker 1>They sure did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2689
02:06:47.011 --> 02:06:49.140
<v Speaker 1>A fucking cluster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

2690
02:06:49.470 --> 02:06:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Big time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2691
02:06:51.690 --> 02:06:56.690
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine being a guy and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>growIng up there and you're on that </v>

2692
02:06:56.690 --> 02:06:57.730
<v Speaker 1>island with 17 dudes and three women are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2693
02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:58.830
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

2694
02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I know that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a shitty deal that I got to be </v>

2695
02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:07.341
<v Speaker 1>the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to get laid as a man in China </v>

2696
02:07:07.341 --> 02:07:07.341
<v Speaker 1>must be fucking hard.</v>

2697
02:07:07.341 --> 02:07:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I can see how that would not be easy or </v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine people,</v>

2698
02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:13.480
<v Speaker 1>high school universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

2699
02:07:13.481 --> 02:07:16.370
<v Speaker 1>a young males would be pretty deep piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>golf.</v>

2700
02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Condom shares fall after China abandons </v>
<v Speaker 1>one child shares in companies that make.</v>

2701
02:07:23.370 --> 02:07:26.580
<v Speaker 1>What does that nappies prems and baby </v>
<v Speaker 1>milk up.</v>

2702
02:07:26.610 --> 02:07:27.170
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2703
02:07:27.330 --> 02:07:32.330
<v Speaker 1>I guess like baby stuff up on friday </v>
<v Speaker 1>after beijing announces plans to change </v>

2704
02:07:32.330 --> 02:07:37.161
<v Speaker 1>family planning laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know how they're going to </v>

2705
02:07:37.161 --> 02:07:37.161
<v Speaker 1>engineer their population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2706
02:07:37.161 --> 02:07:42.060
<v Speaker 1>this was in response to overpopulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why they decided to have a one </v>

2707
02:07:42.060 --> 02:07:45.721
<v Speaker 1>child policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just not good when everybody </v>

2708
02:07:45.721 --> 02:07:45.721
<v Speaker 1>wants a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2709
02:07:45.721 --> 02:07:50.371
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that they didn't think he threw in </v>

2710
02:07:50.371 --> 02:07:50.371
<v Speaker 1>that scenario because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see the idea.</v>

2711
02:07:50.371 --> 02:07:52.380
<v Speaker 1>You have too many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too few resources.</v>

2712
02:07:52.460 --> 02:07:53.890
<v Speaker 1>You'll get fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll kind of do that.</v>

2713
02:07:53.891 --> 02:07:55.540
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time now he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2714
02:07:55.940 --> 02:08:00.940
<v Speaker 1>nobody was going to have a baby girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's all have boys because that's </v>

2715

<v Speaker 1>what I want.</v>

2716

<v Speaker 1>dumb ass is whining that you don't have </v>

2727
02:08:36.990 --> 02:08:38.700
<v Speaker 1>a son to play softball with and even in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that light,</v>

2728
02:08:38.710 --> 02:08:42.490
<v Speaker 1>because you can't fucking teach a girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>to play softball because it's not girly.</v>

2729
02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:47.230
<v Speaker 1>What a of play softball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you know the idea that your son is</v>

2730
02:08:47.231 --> 02:08:52.231
<v Speaker 1>an extension of you is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupidest fucking attachments that some </v>

2731
02:08:52.231 --> 02:08:52.231
<v Speaker 1>people have.</v>

2732
02:08:52.231 --> 02:08:53.440
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a human being.</v>

2733
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:56.200
<v Speaker 1>The human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fortunate enough to be the parent</v>

2734
02:08:56.201 --> 02:09:01.201
<v Speaker 1>of this human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that you're upset that it's </v>

2735
02:09:01.201 --> 02:09:02.740
<v Speaker 1>one gender or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just shut the fuck up you monkey.</v>

2736
02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:06.460
<v Speaker 1>And that goes back to the stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes of masculine and family.</v>

2737
02:09:06.461 --> 02:09:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Know what it means to be a man or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

2738
02:09:09.371 --> 02:09:14.371
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course there's genetic stuff and </v>

2739
02:09:14.371 --> 02:09:14.371
<v Speaker 1>there's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a given.</v>

2740
02:09:14.371 --> 02:09:17.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not even an article at </v>

2741
02:09:17.971 --> 02:09:19.420
<v Speaker 1>simultaneous in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also a bunch of feet </v>

2742
02:09:19.420 --> 02:09:21.721
<v Speaker 1>that these nurture and these solar rays </v>
<v Speaker 1>and somebody may have a tendency going </v>

2743
02:09:21.721 --> 02:09:25.860
<v Speaker 1>one way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you teach them and you can </v>

2744
02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:25.860
<v Speaker 1>balance it out in other ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2745
02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:30.080
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me even the most interesting people </v>

2746
02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:30.080
<v Speaker 1>are the ones that I've built that have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2747
02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:33.730
<v Speaker 1>the stereotypical sensitivity from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be female,</v>

2748
02:09:33.731 --> 02:09:38.731
<v Speaker 1>but they are always so tough and who the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell said that being emotionally </v>

2749
02:09:38.731 --> 02:09:43.510
<v Speaker 1>sensitive is a only for women or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>being tough is only for men.</v>

2750
02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:46.540
<v Speaker 1>I get bored with both people unless you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have both,</v>

2751
02:09:46.630 --> 02:09:49.150
<v Speaker 1>unless I can relate to you on multiple </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>

2752
02:09:49.390 --> 02:09:51.580
<v Speaker 1>It's pouring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like can be for sure.</v>

2753
02:09:52.290 --> 02:09:54.820
<v Speaker 1>The typical girly girl is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jesus,</v>

2754
02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm fearing sick disease killing me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so boring.</v>

2755
02:09:59.621 --> 02:10:02.520
<v Speaker 1>But also the typical guy who breaks a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beer bottle off,</v>

2756
02:10:02.521 --> 02:10:04.270
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching affordable.</v>

2757
02:10:04.330 --> 02:10:06.760
<v Speaker 1>That's not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2758
02:10:06.761 --> 02:10:09.220
<v Speaker 1>That's great for about 10 minutes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'm out.</v>

2759
02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:14.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to me it's like the aveda human </v>

2760
02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:15.640
<v Speaker 1>beings that are strong and sensitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is wrong with that idea?</v>

2761
02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:16.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2762
02:10:16.930 --> 02:10:21.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why one of the biggest problems </v>

2763
02:10:21.930 --> 02:10:21.930
<v Speaker 1>growing up as if you're stuck in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood,</v>

2764
02:10:21.970 --> 02:10:26.970
<v Speaker 1>if you're stuck in the neighborhood and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people in your neighborhood are all </v>

2765
02:10:26.970 --> 02:10:27.640
<v Speaker 1>stupid and there's no one interesting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>draw from.</v>

2766
02:10:27.641 --> 02:10:29.800
<v Speaker 1>There's no one to find that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to.</v>

2767
02:10:30.010 --> 02:10:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember being a kid and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2768
02:10:32.591 --> 02:10:33.980
<v Speaker 1>you have a good friends that you</v>

2769
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.320
<v Speaker 3>really enjoy hanging out with and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they weren't around,</v>

2770
02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:38.450
<v Speaker 3>he would hang out with dummies and you'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>

2771
02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:41.210
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so taxing.</v>

2772
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:43.190
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have the wrong,</v>

2773
02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:48.220
<v Speaker 3>if you just buy a roll of the dice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find yourself in a neighborhood where </v>

2774
02:10:48.220 --> 02:10:52.840
<v Speaker 3>people are prejudiced or ignorant or </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressively ignorant or aggressive or </v>

2775
02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:54.560
<v Speaker 3>prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could just have a terrible time.</v>

2776
02:10:54.561 --> 02:10:57.620
<v Speaker 3>He just want to stay home and be locked </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your environment.</v>

2777
02:10:57.621 --> 02:10:59.720
<v Speaker 3>And I think until the internet came </v>
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>

2778
02:10:59.750 --> 02:11:02.720
<v Speaker 3>that was the biggest issue in children </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing up.</v>

2779
02:11:02.721 --> 02:11:06.800
<v Speaker 3>You were a subject to your environment </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a victim of your environment.</v>

2780
02:11:06.801 --> 02:11:08.480
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes a product of your environment.</v>

2781
02:11:08.630 --> 02:11:10.790
<v Speaker 2>That's why even what we're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>

2782
02:11:10.791 --> 02:11:15.791
<v Speaker 2>the idea that somebody in Sweden can </v>
<v Speaker 2>download and listen to what's happening </v>

2783
02:11:16.250 --> 02:11:17.870
<v Speaker 2>that's 30,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean shit.</v>

2784
02:11:17.871 --> 02:11:22.871
<v Speaker 2>I would have loved to grown up with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of needing to conversation </v>

2785
02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:28.120
<v Speaker 2>so that I'm not traveling to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediate reward that is in the few for </v>

2786
02:11:28.120 --> 02:11:29.090
<v Speaker 2>where you are born and when you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>raised,</v>

2787
02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:31.740
<v Speaker 2>but you'll get access to and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize,</v>

2788
02:11:31.741 --> 02:11:36.030
<v Speaker 2>well there are people out there with </v>
<v Speaker 2>different way of thinking other than.</v>

2789
02:11:36.031 --> 02:11:41.031
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about even when tv came </v>
<v Speaker 2>around than somebody in the middle of </v>

2790
02:11:41.031 --> 02:11:44.231
<v Speaker 2>the United States in a town of 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people suddenly could see people who </v>

2791
02:11:44.231 --> 02:11:48.491
<v Speaker 2>look differently or a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation has been the most freeing </v>

2792
02:11:48.491 --> 02:11:49.040
<v Speaker 2>thing in the world.</v>

2793
02:11:49.230 --> 02:11:50.700
<v Speaker 3>Unless you were black and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2794
02:11:50.701 --> 02:11:54.770
<v Speaker 3>where the fuck are all the black,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sanford and son?</v>

<v Speaker 3>finally,</v>

2797

<v Speaker 2>19 fifties,</v>

2798
02:12:03.130 --> 02:12:05.970
<v Speaker 2>hold the advertise that are sold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The programmers tilt.</v>

2799
02:12:06.070 --> 02:12:11.070
<v Speaker 2>In order to attract people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to make the content as not </v>

2800
02:12:11.160 --> 02:12:14.590
<v Speaker 2>controvert like the most uncontroversial</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing possible.</v>

2801
02:12:14.591 --> 02:12:17.140
<v Speaker 2>We make it very square.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We make it very safe.</v>

2802
02:12:17.170 --> 02:12:20.510
<v Speaker 2>No sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no violence will make it not end.</v>

2803
02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:20.970
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>get all that.</v>

2806
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:32.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2807
02:12:32.931 --> 02:12:33.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

2809
02:12:35.721 --> 02:12:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Like advertisements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like advertisements today,</v>

2810
02:12:38.930 --> 02:12:41.570
<v Speaker 3>like on the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like podcasts here.</v>

2811
02:12:41.571 --> 02:12:44.210
<v Speaker 3>This is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one has ever,</v>

2812
02:12:44.570 --> 02:12:48.480
<v Speaker 3>when I do a podcast ad say don't swear </v>
<v Speaker 3>or don't see something fucked up.</v>

2813
02:12:48.481 --> 02:12:49.810
<v Speaker 3>Like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up things.</v>

2814
02:12:49.811 --> 02:12:52.140
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes these ads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm winging it,</v>

2815
02:12:52.230 --> 02:12:55.610
<v Speaker 3>is a little long as I'm not saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2816
02:12:55.611 --> 02:12:57.440
<v Speaker 3>When I say fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things are obviously jokes.</v>

2817
02:12:57.470 --> 02:13:02.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as I'm not saying anything </v>

2818
02:13:02.470 --> 02:13:02.900
<v Speaker 3>that's actually racist or homophobic or </v>
<v Speaker 3>sexist or anything like that,</v>

2819
02:13:03.260 --> 02:13:08.260
<v Speaker 3>people are fine with it and you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>never have one of my ads on a television</v>

2820
02:13:08.511 --> 02:13:09.380
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no way,</v>

2821
02:13:09.620 --> 02:13:14.620
<v Speaker 3>but the people that watched a television</v>
<v Speaker 3>show or the same people that are going </v>

2822
02:13:14.620 --> 02:13:18.761
<v Speaker 3>to download a lot of podcasts exactly </v>
<v Speaker 3>like if like someone's listening to </v>

<v Speaker 3>that's the same person that might watch </v>

<v Speaker 3>the big bang theory or america's got </v>
<v Speaker 3>talent at night and it's squeaky clean.</v>

2826

<v Speaker 3>What's the same human being?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2827
02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:33.640
<v Speaker 3>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for whatever reason they decided </v>

2828
02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:36.620
<v Speaker 3>this human being can accept it in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>form but can accept it in that form like</v>

2829
02:13:37.891 --> 02:13:41.550

2830
02:13:41.551 --> 02:13:46.551
<v Speaker 3>squeaky clean and the advertisers are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the same person might go to a rated </v>

2831
02:13:46.551 --> 02:13:51.081
<v Speaker 3>r movie and watch crazy violence and </v>
<v Speaker 3>death and some fucking horror film.</v>

<v Speaker 3>cannot be subjected to cannot be exposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Especially with nudity.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Everybody wants their dick sucked.</v>

2881
02:16:03.730 --> 02:16:05.080
<v Speaker 3>If you have a dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want it.</v>

2882
02:16:05.110 --> 02:16:09.150
<v Speaker 3>Soft is the one universal truth because </v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you're gay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2886
02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:15.960
<v Speaker 3>Everybody loves blowjobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're amazing.</v>

2887
02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:21.080
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the greatest inventions that</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody ever figured out was that if </v>

2888
02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:21.080
<v Speaker 3>someone's sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your dip,</v>

2889
02:16:21.080 --> 02:16:25.671
<v Speaker 3>it feels fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To watch it in a movie is somehow </v>

2890
02:16:25.671 --> 02:16:27.660
<v Speaker 3>horrifically offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally consensual.</v>

2891
02:16:27.780 --> 02:16:30.370
<v Speaker 3>We're not watching you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're watching a totally consensual</v>

2892
02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:31.930
<v Speaker 2>sex act in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

2893
02:16:31.931 --> 02:16:34.600
<v Speaker 2>the same people that were offended </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably watch porn,</v>

2894
02:16:34.810 --> 02:16:35.530
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

2895
02:16:35.531 --> 02:16:40.531
<v Speaker 2>but as long as the windows are closed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the shades are shut and the door is </v>

2896
02:16:40.531 --> 02:16:43.951
<v Speaker 2>closed and no one can hear them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they can pick and jerk off and </v>

2897
02:16:44.111 --> 02:16:46.840
<v Speaker 2>they're hypocritical world and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's okay.</v>

2898
02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:50.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember if I mentioned that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you before or knowledge because I always</v>

2899
02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:56.040
<v Speaker 2>cracks me up so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a study neva know in Utah </v>

2900
02:16:56.040 --> 02:16:56.040
<v Speaker 2>a few years ago where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2901
02:16:56.140 --> 02:17:01.140
<v Speaker 2>because the standard way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the supreme court at the top of the </v>

2902
02:17:01.140 --> 02:17:03.571
<v Speaker 2>obscenity laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically said that it boils down </v>

2903
02:17:03.571 --> 02:17:04.640
<v Speaker 2>to the standards of the community of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the defined obscene or nothin swing</v>

2904
02:17:04.670 --> 02:17:05.410
<v Speaker 2>uta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were saying,</v>

2905
02:17:05.411 --> 02:17:07.120
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are a very conservative community,</v>

2906
02:17:07.121 --> 02:17:07.930
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2907
02:17:08.500 --> 02:17:11.180
<v Speaker 2>we want the old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old tale chains.</v>

2908
02:17:11.330 --> 02:17:14.950
<v Speaker 2>You need to not be able to allow to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>porn.</v>

2909
02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:20.070
<v Speaker 2>They cannot sell barn is the number one </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing on the paper view in hotels are </v>

2910
02:17:20.730 --> 02:17:21.160
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>

2911
02:17:21.310 --> 02:17:23.320
<v Speaker 2>because the fence the standards of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

2912
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:28.830
<v Speaker 2>So then they did these research and </v>
<v Speaker 2>found out a porn consumption in Utah is </v>

2913
02:17:28.830 --> 02:17:32.611
<v Speaker 2>actually way higher than most other </v>
<v Speaker 2>places to find what people say.</v>

2914
02:17:33.090 --> 02:17:38.090
<v Speaker 2>I will have people who are completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>different and that's how I find it </v>

2915
02:17:38.740 --> 02:17:43.740
<v Speaker 2>affected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about being comfortable in your </v>

2916
02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:43.740
<v Speaker 2>skin to me is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2917
02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:45.820
<v Speaker 2>you like porn race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just accepted.</v>

2918
02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:49.450
<v Speaker 2>It's who you are as long as they are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>key people,</v>

2919
02:17:49.451 --> 02:17:52.330
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're not doing anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible to other human beings.</v>

2920
02:17:52.810 --> 02:17:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Acts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't put forward this image of what you</v>

2921
02:17:56.321 --> 02:17:58.570
<v Speaker 2>think you should be when you're not that</v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

2922
02:17:58.571 --> 02:18:01.420
<v Speaker 2>If you're not that person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why is not that healthy</v>

2923
02:18:01.421 --> 02:18:03.100
<v Speaker 2>for you is not the way you're built to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

2924
02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:04.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something there.</v>

2925
02:18:04.460 --> 02:18:06.490
<v Speaker 2>They deal with reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2926
02:18:06.491 --> 02:18:08.860
<v Speaker 2>deal with where you're at and if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to change yourself,</v>

2927
02:18:08.861 --> 02:18:11.080
<v Speaker 2>then take a few baby steps away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2928
02:18:11.081 --> 02:18:14.440
<v Speaker 2>but start accepting the fed that dcs </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you are.</v>

2929
02:18:14.441 --> 02:18:16.480
<v Speaker 2>This is what you like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what you don't.</v>

2930
02:18:16.990 --> 02:18:20.970
<v Speaker 2>Then if you decide you want to change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can work on the address.</v>

2931
02:18:20.971 --> 02:18:25.971
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to change dramatically </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't change the essence of </v>

2932
02:18:25.971 --> 02:18:25.971
<v Speaker 2>who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can,</v>

2933
02:18:25.971 --> 02:18:26.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smooth the edges if you really,</v>

2934
02:18:26.531 --> 02:18:28.540
<v Speaker 2>really want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that never happened.</v>

2935
02:18:28.541 --> 02:18:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start with realizing what it is that</v>

2936
02:18:31.331 --> 02:18:34.240
<v Speaker 2>you are and you stare at it and accept </v>
<v Speaker 2>it for what it is.</v>

2937
02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:39.260
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting too because I think </v>

2938
02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:41.221
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of what people are worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>about is other people's perceptions of </v>

2939
02:18:41.221 --> 02:18:45.601
<v Speaker 2>them and those same people are shielding</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own reality from other people.</v>

2940
02:18:45.970 --> 02:18:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Worried about their perceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might all be into the same thing.</v>

2941
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:50.460
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2942
02:18:50.580 --> 02:18:52.450
<v Speaker 2>There's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2943
02:18:52.510 --> 02:18:55.270
<v Speaker 2>the podcast center the other day coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

2944
02:18:55.271 --> 02:18:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I sent it to the world but a while back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was reading through and one thing</v>

2945
02:18:59.111 --> 02:19:01.060
<v Speaker 2>that he was cracked up about is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

2946
02:19:01.061 --> 02:19:06.061
<v Speaker 2>you have zero filter your toys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the staff you say about what you </v>

2947
02:19:06.061 --> 02:19:06.200
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what.</v>

2948
02:19:07.090 --> 02:19:10.980
<v Speaker 2>That's not the kind of theme that boss </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that meet to you though.</v>

2949
02:19:10.990 --> 02:19:13.780
<v Speaker 2>That's the kind of stuff that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>socially.</v>

2950
02:19:13.781 --> 02:19:15.820
<v Speaker 2>Most people who are professors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2951
02:19:15.821 --> 02:19:18.010
<v Speaker 2>Never mind that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>

2952
02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:19.070
<v Speaker 2>Your world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2953
02:19:19.120 --> 02:19:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does this image of how we are </v>

2954
02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:25.741
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to me it's like that's such </v>

2955
02:19:25.741 --> 02:19:25.741
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

2956
02:19:25.741 --> 02:19:25.840
<v Speaker 2>b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>b,</v>

2957
02:19:25.841 --> 02:19:30.841
<v Speaker 2>a you on being about that extra freedom </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have podcasts and because </v>

2958
02:19:31.251 --> 02:19:36.251
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can express yourself through that </v>

2959
02:19:36.251 --> 02:19:36.251
<v Speaker 2>and you can actually make money doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that too.</v>

2960
02:19:36.251 --> 02:19:39.730
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's you have these other outlets for </v>

2961
02:19:39.730 --> 02:19:39.730
<v Speaker 2>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2962
02:19:39.770 --> 02:19:44.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think I realized I had these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a really stupid idea for a long time </v>

2963
02:19:44.770 --> 02:19:48.800
<v Speaker 2>that I could get a regular gig in </v>
<v Speaker 2>academia as I see it.</v>

2964
02:19:48.801 --> 02:19:53.801
<v Speaker 2>He goes by fast surrender and I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>have also the space to do all the other </v>

2965
02:19:53.801 --> 02:19:55.250
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized this was actually,</v>

2966
02:19:55.550 --> 02:20:00.550
<v Speaker 2>I remember beating my office one day </v>
<v Speaker 2>after the realization that most </v>

2967
02:20:00.550 --> 02:20:01.670
<v Speaker 2>academics don't like me sync,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sung keen.</v>

2968
02:20:02.120 --> 02:20:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Most academics don't like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

2969
02:20:05.060 --> 02:20:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm a student like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they don't like them,</v>

2970
02:20:10.191 --> 02:20:13.250
<v Speaker 2>that means oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you must be too easy or too something or</v>

2971
02:20:13.251 --> 02:20:18.251
<v Speaker 2>sort of fed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get along very well with students and </v>

2972
02:20:18.251 --> 02:20:20.860
<v Speaker 2>that's not always the case with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's usually strike against me and </v>

2973
02:20:20.860 --> 02:20:23.300
<v Speaker 2>also when I was having this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2974
02:20:23.301 --> 02:20:24.680
<v Speaker 2>why is it that I didn't like me?</v>

2975
02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:27.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of step outside and it for my.</v>

2976
02:20:27.930 --> 02:20:30.140
<v Speaker 2>And he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean my office hours,</v>

2977
02:20:30.230 --> 02:20:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm playing him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He named me my office and I have around </v>

2978
02:20:35.230 --> 02:20:35.230
<v Speaker 2>my neck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our strap,</v>

2979
02:20:35.230 --> 02:20:39.591
<v Speaker 2>the globes that are just used to spar </v>
<v Speaker 2>with one of my students during a break </v>

2980
02:20:39.591 --> 02:20:43.780
<v Speaker 2>in my hand is my medical marihuana and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you had a blog he'd but why don't they </v>

2981
02:20:46.140 --> 02:20:47.590
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2982
02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:53.120
<v Speaker 2>if they like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there wouldn't be something we didn't </v>

2983
02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:54.890
<v Speaker 2>decide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you expect they are with her and</v>

2984
02:20:54.891 --> 02:20:56.760
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the eighties,</v>

2985
02:20:56.870 --> 02:21:01.870
<v Speaker 2>but you can't expect to be just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're polite and you opened the door </v>

2986
02:21:01.870 --> 02:21:03.200
<v Speaker 2>for people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nice,</v>

2987
02:21:03.230 --> 02:21:06.320
<v Speaker 2>but you're still if a very different </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal from what they are.</v>

2988
02:21:06.321 --> 02:21:10.250
<v Speaker 2>And so of course they are now gonna </v>
<v Speaker 2>embrace you as one of the few guys.</v>

2989
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:13.010
<v Speaker 2>I bet you and daddy asked russell if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were in the same staff,</v>

2990
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:14.300
<v Speaker 2>get along great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

2991
02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:15.710
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a few.</v>

2992
02:21:15.770 --> 02:21:17.390
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people out there that are.</v>

2993
02:21:17.690 --> 02:21:18.410
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>

2994
02:21:18.411 --> 02:21:20.330
<v Speaker 2>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying all people,</v>

2995
02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:23.650
<v Speaker 2>all academics are all equally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve barring gas,</v>

2996
02:21:23.651 --> 02:21:25.850
<v Speaker 2>so that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some radical people,</v>

2997
02:21:25.851 --> 02:21:30.851
<v Speaker 2>but the culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the general culture of what you're </v>

2998
02:21:30.851 --> 02:21:31.370
<v Speaker 2>supposed to fit in is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very steep one.</v>

2999
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3000
02:21:32.900 --> 02:21:35.520
<v Speaker 2>you've been a professor for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel like the,</v>

3001
02:21:35.560 --> 02:21:37.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the culture is shifting?</v>

3002
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:45.050
<v Speaker 2>The culture outside of academia shifts a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot faster than the culture inside,</v>

3003
02:21:45.490 --> 02:21:50.490
<v Speaker 2>like cooling institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tend to be the last place to </v>

3004
02:21:50.490 --> 02:21:53.351
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when everybody else gets to </v>

3005
02:21:53.351 --> 02:21:54.680
<v Speaker 2>accept something that maybe they will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like politics,</v>

3006
02:21:54.681 --> 02:21:59.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas like after 99 percent of people </v>

3007
02:21:59.681 --> 02:21:59.960
<v Speaker 2>in us will be put on legalization of </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana,</v>

3008
02:21:59.961 --> 02:22:04.961
<v Speaker 2>then some politician will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll do this really daring thing and </v>

3009
02:22:04.961 --> 02:22:04.961
<v Speaker 2>try to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3010
02:22:04.961 --> 02:22:09.410
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to start from the inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>at any establishment is built on keeping</v>

3011
02:22:09.411 --> 02:22:11.320
<v Speaker 2>the status quo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's nowhere.</v>

3012
02:22:11.530 --> 02:22:13.460
<v Speaker 2>So I locked off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If anything,</v>

3013
02:22:13.461 --> 02:22:18.461
<v Speaker 2>a lot of academia I'm seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's becoming more and more </v>

3014
02:22:18.461 --> 02:22:21.161
<v Speaker 2>bureaucratic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more of a do measurable seeings </v>

3015
02:22:21.161 --> 02:22:24.440
<v Speaker 2>do stuff that everything can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>accounted for so we don't get sued.</v>

3016
02:22:24.470 --> 02:22:29.470
<v Speaker 2>Make sure to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot less flexibility and </v>

3017
02:22:29.470 --> 02:22:32.190
<v Speaker 2>allowing people to kind of run the show </v>
<v Speaker 2>as they like it because they're like,</v>

3018
02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:35.010
<v Speaker 2>what if somebody runs it the wrong way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they will get sued,</v>

3019
02:22:35.011 --> 02:22:40.011
<v Speaker 2>which sure that is a concern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're also eliminating the </v>

3020
02:22:40.011 --> 02:22:42.000
<v Speaker 2>possibility of people doing cool things </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the process and so I don't know.</v>

3021
02:22:42.001 --> 02:22:47.001
<v Speaker 2>I don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't see tremendously good changes in </v>

3022
02:22:47.001 --> 02:22:47.001
<v Speaker 2>that regard.</v>

3023
02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:52.100
<v Speaker 3>What about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the changes in as far as political </v>

3024
02:22:52.100 --> 02:22:52.390
<v Speaker 3>correctness or the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3025
02:22:52.391 --> 02:22:57.391
<v Speaker 3>the ideologies on campus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they seemed to be more extreme and more </v>

3026
02:22:57.391 --> 02:22:59.130
<v Speaker 3>left wing now than they have in any time</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the most recent history,</v>

3027
02:22:59.370 --> 02:23:00.870
<v Speaker 3>at least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I'm not in school,</v>

3028
02:23:00.871 --> 02:23:05.220
<v Speaker 3>but from people that are reporting on it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and professors that I've interviewed,</v>

3029
02:23:05.620 --> 02:23:10.620
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm pulling for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has done that because honestly I hear </v>

3030
02:23:10.620 --> 02:23:11.580
<v Speaker 2>about it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read it in the newspapers,</v>

3031
02:23:11.581 --> 02:23:15.060
<v Speaker 2>I hear about it from other people </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling me I don't see it.</v>

3032
02:23:15.270 --> 02:23:16.750
<v Speaker 2>What do you experience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3033
02:23:16.751 --> 02:23:21.751
<v Speaker 2>the whole extreme level of political </v>
<v Speaker 2>correctness is not one that I have two </v>

3034
02:23:22.530 --> 02:23:25.530
<v Speaker 2>that I witness a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get to what I do.</v>

3035
02:23:25.531 --> 02:23:27.630
<v Speaker 2>I say what I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody gets pissed off,</v>

3036
02:23:27.660 --> 02:23:31.910
<v Speaker 2>nobody yelled at me over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tends to be fairly injera guarders,</v>

3037
02:23:31.911 --> 02:23:36.911
<v Speaker 2>tila little and I don't see my students </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting offended that I ever seen the </v>

3038
02:23:36.911 --> 02:23:39.990
<v Speaker 2>way you would read based on websites and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that that doesn't exist.</v>

3039
02:23:39.991 --> 02:23:42.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it must be based on something.</v>

3040
02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:47.600
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think he's quite as either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm extremely lucky for some reason or </v>

3041
02:23:47.600 --> 02:23:50.940
<v Speaker 2>he's not quite as pervasive as it sounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>on paper,</v>

3042
02:23:51.180 --> 02:23:56.180
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course all I know is my experience </v>

3043
02:23:56.180 --> 02:23:56.180
<v Speaker 2>and that may not be representative of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's out there.</v>

3044
02:23:56.460 --> 02:24:01.460
<v Speaker 3>It's also probably indicative of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sheer numbers of people that are in </v>

3045
02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:05.181
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see that old bill hicks </v>

3046
02:24:05.181 --> 02:24:07.941
<v Speaker 3>bit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill hicks had this really funny bit </v>

3047
02:24:07.941 --> 02:24:07.941
<v Speaker 3>about cnn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how you.</v>

3048
02:24:07.941 --> 02:24:12.360
<v Speaker 3>Every time you turn the news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>murdered death pit bulls and he goes and</v>

3049
02:24:12.361 --> 02:24:14.880
<v Speaker 3>then you go look out the window when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>hear a chirp chirp.</v>

3050
02:24:15.700 --> 02:24:17.640
<v Speaker 3>He was where the flux all this shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

3051
02:24:18.910 --> 02:24:23.790
<v Speaker 3>But I think just the sheer numbers of </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings that are in school.</v>

3052
02:24:23.791 --> 02:24:25.800
<v Speaker 3>If you're dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3053
02:24:25.860 --> 02:24:29.100
<v Speaker 3>how many millions of kids are in school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many there are,</v>

3054
02:24:29.310 --> 02:24:34.310
<v Speaker 3>but out of those you're going to be able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to cherry pick some extreme examples of </v>

3055
02:24:34.681 --> 02:24:37.440
<v Speaker 3>social justice warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>political correct thinking,</v>

3056
02:24:37.890 --> 02:24:40.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive thinking,</v>

3057
02:24:40.291 --> 02:24:42.900
<v Speaker 3>run a muck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's diversity.</v>

3058
02:24:42.901 --> 02:24:45.390
<v Speaker 3>Run a mock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what going on.</v>

3059
02:24:45.420 --> 02:24:48.490
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a that makes for a story</v>
<v Speaker 3>that got</v>

3060
02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:53.110
<v Speaker 2>about or as if you talk about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the same as wide way like water,</v>

3061
02:24:53.111 --> 02:24:58.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the extreme out there kind of thing that</v>

3062
02:24:58.061 --> 02:25:00.760
<v Speaker 2>makes people emotional involving the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

3063
02:25:01.060 --> 02:25:03.100
<v Speaker 2>You would report it and people get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3064
02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:08.520
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the fuel really talk about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the time happens is not that </v>

3065
02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:09.670
<v Speaker 2>glamorous and so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as a reporter.</v>

3066
02:25:09.860 --> 02:25:14.860
<v Speaker 3>Have you had any backlash at all from </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing like controversial podcast cause </v>

3067
02:25:14.860 --> 02:25:16.760
<v Speaker 3>you know you don't hold back?</v>

3068
02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:18.780
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely not volunteers,</v>

3069
02:25:18.810 --> 02:25:21.290
<v Speaker 2>but I think algae is that probably these</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not the same.</v>

3070
02:25:21.291 --> 02:25:24.520
<v Speaker 2>People will listen to podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>care or date.</v>

3071
02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:26.620
<v Speaker 2>They brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is so good.</v>

3072
02:25:26.621 --> 02:25:30.160
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in a history department meeting.</v>

3073
02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:35.400
<v Speaker 2>I won't mention the school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that makes a difference because </v>

3074
02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:35.400
<v Speaker 2>it's the same scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably 99 percent of them,</v>

3075
02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:38.650
<v Speaker 2>but they were talking and this is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>30 people or whatever.</v>

3076
02:25:38.651 --> 02:25:42.010
<v Speaker 2>Many people who are historians who </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they do.</v>

3077
02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:44.500
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I mentioned dan carlin hardcore</v>

3078
02:25:44.501 --> 02:25:47.550
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody knew what I was talking about and</v>

3079
02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:49.800
<v Speaker 2>fucking kidding me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3080
02:25:49.980 --> 02:25:54.980
<v Speaker 2>you are a historian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the number one history podcast </v>

3081
02:25:55.060 --> 02:25:58.570
<v Speaker 2>out there is one on the planet podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>period of any kind.</v>

3082
02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:03.720
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing the guys at god at lane </v>
<v Speaker 2>this game in 90 minute or theme like you</v>

3083
02:26:04.151 --> 02:26:09.151
<v Speaker 2>didn't even bother checking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's that tells me that you're so </v>

3084
02:26:09.151 --> 02:26:11.490
<v Speaker 2>locked in a tower out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have no idea what's.</v>

3085
02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:17.460
<v Speaker 2>I was blown away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean even I was surprised and they </v>

3086
02:26:17.460 --> 02:26:19.530
<v Speaker 2>have really bad feelings about academia </v>
<v Speaker 2>to begin with and I was.</v>

3087
02:26:19.750 --> 02:26:21.190
<v Speaker 2>That was too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even for me.</v>

3088
02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:24.130
<v Speaker 2>How is someone in the world of history </v>
<v Speaker 2>not find out about that?</v>

3089
02:26:24.131 --> 02:26:27.160
<v Speaker 2>That seems like it's such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary way to distribute history.</v>

3090
02:26:27.161 --> 02:26:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>precisely,</v>

3091
02:26:28.270 --> 02:26:33.270
<v Speaker 2>but that tells you how insulated are </v>
<v Speaker 2>days where it's about what's in the </v>

3092
02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:34.340
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To note on page three,</v>

3093
02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:38.890
<v Speaker 2>57 of the monograph that has been read </v>
<v Speaker 2>by four people they may know about,</v>

3094
02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:43.920
<v Speaker 2>but that's weird that weird world yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know that weird world is what </v>

3095
02:26:44.621 --> 02:26:48.610
<v Speaker 2>got people to this age today where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do things like hardcore history.</v>

3096
02:26:48.611 --> 02:26:53.611
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was all created by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge that was taught through </v>

3097
02:26:53.611 --> 02:26:55.170
<v Speaker 2>schools and then dda bidding that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

3098
02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:56.710
<v Speaker 2>one of his podcast where you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3099
02:26:56.711 --> 02:27:01.030
<v Speaker 2>in the past history was a bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>holistic in nature where goofy story on,</v>

3100
02:27:01.031 --> 02:27:06.031
<v Speaker 2>so we're also good storytellers and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>may have not been quite the same level </v>

3101
02:27:06.031 --> 02:27:07.740
<v Speaker 2>of researchers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were really good storytellers.</v>

3102
02:27:08.290 --> 02:27:13.290
<v Speaker 2>History is moving more and more in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction of a good nerds will heat the </v>

3103
02:27:13.290 --> 02:27:17.911
<v Speaker 2>lie that are your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you don't have to go to the library </v>

3104
02:27:17.911 --> 02:27:20.131
<v Speaker 2>or do it online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that are hardcore into research of </v>

3105
02:27:20.131 --> 02:27:20.520
<v Speaker 2>primary sources and you need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3106
02:27:20.530 --> 02:27:25.530
<v Speaker 2>of course you need that skill because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise you don't have the data to </v>

3107
02:27:25.530 --> 02:27:25.530
<v Speaker 2>subpoena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good story about that,</v>

3108
02:27:25.530 --> 02:27:27.820
<v Speaker 2>but if that's the history that's out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

3109
02:27:27.821 --> 02:27:32.821
<v Speaker 2>you can have the most accurate history </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the ward and nobody wanted to eat it </v>

3110
02:27:32.821 --> 02:27:33.910
<v Speaker 2>because these guys can tell it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's dry.</v>

3111
02:27:33.940 --> 02:27:38.940
<v Speaker 2>You need a bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you need the hardcore </v>

3112
02:27:38.940 --> 02:27:40.660
<v Speaker 2>researcher would dig south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>32 beats it in there.</v>

3113
02:27:40.750 --> 02:27:45.750
<v Speaker 2>Then you need the ones who can spin it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way to that can communicate with </v>

3114
02:27:45.750 --> 02:27:47.920
<v Speaker 2>other human beings that people that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>make an mk or they can make it a mean.</v>

3115
02:27:47.921 --> 02:27:52.921
<v Speaker 2>Interested can and these are often not </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same people because it requires a </v>

3116
02:27:52.921 --> 02:27:53.860
<v Speaker 2>very different balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3117
02:27:53.861 --> 02:27:57.550
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of people say about neil </v>
<v Speaker 2>degrasse tyson as well,</v>

3118
02:27:57.551 --> 02:28:01.180
<v Speaker 2>that he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's such a brilliant man,</v>

3119
02:28:01.181 --> 02:28:06.181
<v Speaker 2>but a brilliant communicator like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His real skill is in making it </v>

3120
02:28:06.181 --> 02:28:09.320
<v Speaker 2>entertaining and exciting and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>absorbable upset.</v>

3121
02:28:09.430 --> 02:28:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the the dry lectures that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might listen to from a physics </v>

3122
02:28:14.430 --> 02:28:15.400
<v Speaker 2>professor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody cares.</v>

3123
02:28:15.401 --> 02:28:17.440
<v Speaker 2>It's just not get in there for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>

3124
02:28:17.441 --> 02:28:19.860
<v Speaker 2>but you need that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure you need it.</v>

3125
02:28:19.870 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Has that desire acquire that</v>

3126
02:28:21.980 --> 02:28:26.980
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with academia is that they </v>

3127
02:28:26.980 --> 02:28:29.771
<v Speaker 1>have made that guy the only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the measuring stick of what the </v>

3128
02:28:29.771 --> 02:28:31.490
<v Speaker 1>historian is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one side of it.</v>

3129
02:28:31.550 --> 02:28:34.640
<v Speaker 1>It's an important one and I give you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is an important one,</v>

3130
02:28:34.641 --> 02:28:37.580
<v Speaker 1>but it cannot be the only one because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason,</v>

3131
02:28:37.581 --> 02:28:41.150
<v Speaker 1>like every single one of the best books </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever read,</v>

3132
02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:43.090
<v Speaker 1>he's always said eaten by a Jordan </v>
<v Speaker 1>released.</v>

3133
02:28:43.220 --> 02:28:46.190
<v Speaker 1>He's never written by a historian </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Jordan is.</v>

3134
02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:49.730
<v Speaker 1>They are paid to know how to tell a </v>
<v Speaker 1>story to make it.</v>

3135
02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:54.800
<v Speaker 1>You know the reason why you're paid is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you need to hook a reader in </v>

3136
02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:57.330
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't have to read that story </v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes you want to.</v>

3137
02:28:58.010 --> 02:29:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His background was as a journalist,</v>

3138
02:29:00.531 --> 02:29:03.560
<v Speaker 1>you know it's about people who nobody </v>
<v Speaker 1>owes you.</v>

3139
02:29:03.561 --> 02:29:08.450
<v Speaker 1>Their attention is you intrigue them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they want to pay attention.</v>

3140
02:29:08.800 --> 02:29:13.800
<v Speaker 1>That's that skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the people who are professional </v>

3141
02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:17.891
<v Speaker 1>historians in a traditional sense that </v>
<v Speaker 1>talent is not encourage is not something</v>

3142
02:29:18.891 --> 02:29:21.980
<v Speaker 1>you may have it by luck because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you are as a human being,</v>

3143
02:29:22.010 --> 02:29:24.490
<v Speaker 1>but it's not something that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraged to develop.</v>

3144
02:29:24.500 --> 02:29:27.120
<v Speaker 1>As part of being a good historian that </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen as I add,</v>

3145
02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:29.010
<v Speaker 1>that's popularizing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

3146
02:29:29.190 --> 02:29:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with that?</v>

3147
02:29:30.290 --> 02:29:32.990
<v Speaker 1>To be able to make something accessible </v>
<v Speaker 1>to people.</v>

3148
02:29:32.991 --> 02:29:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that funny though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That will be shunned.</v>

3149
02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Popularizing something that's as </v>
<v Speaker 1>important as the historical record.</v>

3150
02:29:40.490 --> 02:29:45.490
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most important things </v>

3151
02:29:45.490 --> 02:29:47.591
<v Speaker 1>for human between human history or for </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings rather is to understand </v>

3152
02:29:47.591 --> 02:29:51.161
<v Speaker 1>history because then you can learn from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mistakes of the past and then </v>

3153
02:29:51.161 --> 02:29:52.110
<v Speaker 1>understand the parallels of what's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on in the current time.</v>

3154
02:29:52.640 --> 02:29:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Like when you look at the roman empire </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you talk about the great excesses </v>

3155
02:29:57.640 --> 02:30:01.670
<v Speaker 1>and how that civilization crumbled under</v>
<v Speaker 1>the weight of its own access.</v>

3156
02:30:02.430 --> 02:30:03.920
<v Speaker 1>You look at us now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

3157
02:30:03.921 --> 02:30:07.490
<v Speaker 1>well there's some parallels here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People on scooters and disneyland.</v>

3158
02:30:07.491 --> 02:30:10.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might not be feeding </v>
<v Speaker 1>christians to the lions,</v>

3159
02:30:10.131 --> 02:30:15.131
<v Speaker 1>but I mean there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely some fucking crazy </v>

3160
02:30:15.131 --> 02:30:16.760
<v Speaker 1>shit going on right now that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to look back on when when you look</v>

3161
02:30:16.761 --> 02:30:21.761
<v Speaker 1>at the average american diet and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that I was in disneyland the other </v>

3162
02:30:21.761 --> 02:30:25.751
<v Speaker 1>day and I told you that are on scooters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the other things is they had </v>

3163
02:30:25.751 --> 02:30:28.931
<v Speaker 1>to change the boats out in the pirates </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the caribbean ride if everybody's </v>

3164
02:30:28.931 --> 02:30:33.170
<v Speaker 1>still bad because people are too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've done this several times.</v>

3165
02:30:33.171 --> 02:30:36.440
<v Speaker 1>They've had to change the boats and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to dig a deeper trench on.</v>

3166
02:30:36.441 --> 02:30:41.441
<v Speaker 1>It's a small world because over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>years people have gotten heavier and </v>

3167
02:30:41.441 --> 02:30:44.951
<v Speaker 1>heavier and they have to accommodate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to take into account the </v>

3168
02:30:44.951 --> 02:30:46.520
<v Speaker 1>possibility of 600 pound people.</v>

3169
02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:52.200
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're doing now because I </v>

3170
02:30:52.200 --> 02:30:54.671
<v Speaker 1>saw several 600 plus pound people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are just overflowing on their scooters </v>

3171
02:30:55.550 --> 02:31:00.260
<v Speaker 1>and they also have to help those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>from their scooters onto these rides.</v>

3172
02:31:00.340 --> 02:31:05.340
<v Speaker 1>So these rides have to be reinforced in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to take the weight of several </v>

3173
02:31:05.340 --> 02:31:06.230
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3174
02:31:06.231 --> 02:31:11.231
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these rides are like you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to only get two people in the </v>

3175
02:31:11.231 --> 02:31:11.270
<v Speaker 1>average to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get two people together,</v>

3176
02:31:11.570 --> 02:31:14.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 400 pounds for two people,</v>

3177
02:31:14.760 --> 02:31:19.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they got one person the weigh 600 </v>

3178
02:31:19.760 --> 02:31:20.640
<v Speaker 1>pounds and so this does this ride's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really designed for this,</v>

3179
02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:23.610
<v Speaker 1>so that's discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've discriminated against,</v>

3180
02:31:23.630 --> 02:31:28.630
<v Speaker 1>are large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large citizens to these is the most </v>

3181
02:31:28.630 --> 02:31:33.321
<v Speaker 1>disgusting stories that have ever earned</v>
<v Speaker 1>or say I totally to danko was seeded by </v>

3182
02:31:33.321 --> 02:31:35.880
<v Speaker 1>podcast is so gross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's sensitive.</v>

3183
02:31:35.881 --> 02:31:38.110
<v Speaker 1>My wife had told me what she was working</v>
<v Speaker 1>in hospital.</v>

3184
02:31:38.110 --> 02:31:38.840
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>

3185
02:31:38.850 --> 02:31:43.260
<v Speaker 1>I got pulled over by a colleague.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They told me this story and it's cowered</v>

3186
02:31:43.261 --> 02:31:48.261
<v Speaker 1>by braid ever seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll gladly scoured the brain of </v>

3187
02:31:48.261 --> 02:31:51.261
<v Speaker 1>everybody listening right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these capital emptied to the doctor </v>

3188
02:31:51.611 --> 02:31:56.611
<v Speaker 1>or they were complaining about how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep trying to get pregnant and she's </v>

3189
02:31:56.611 --> 02:32:00.471
<v Speaker 1>not getting pregnant and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman was like probably a good 500 </v>

3190
02:32:00.471 --> 02:32:01.030
<v Speaker 1>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

3191
02:32:01.050 --> 02:32:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Just rolls of fat everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing.</v>

3192
02:32:04.500 --> 02:32:05.610
<v Speaker 1>And the doctor was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3193
02:32:06.180 --> 02:32:07.350
<v Speaker 1>let's see what's up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

3194
02:32:07.351 --> 02:32:11.520
<v Speaker 1>What's going on and leave the fat folds </v>
<v Speaker 1>left or right.</v>

3195
02:32:12.060 --> 02:32:15.090
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly he realizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

3196
02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:17.640
<v Speaker 1>these people thought they were having </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>

3197
02:32:18.240 --> 02:32:21.750
<v Speaker 1>but based on the rest of you I'm seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>here between the fat falls,</v>

3198
02:32:22.470 --> 02:32:27.470
<v Speaker 1>they weren't exactly having sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy was fucking different folds </v>

3199
02:32:27.970 --> 02:32:31.280
<v Speaker 1>thinking that he was in where he was and</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ben,</v>

3200
02:32:31.281 --> 02:32:32.330
<v Speaker 1>they were that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii,</v>

3201
02:32:32.350 --> 02:32:33.840
<v Speaker 1>they were not getting pregnant.</v>

3202
02:32:34.620 --> 02:32:36.620
<v Speaker 1>They should have let him keep fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact fold.</v>

3203
02:32:37.170 --> 02:32:38.980
<v Speaker 1>You're real close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real close.</v>

3204
02:32:39.720 --> 02:32:41.950
<v Speaker 1>What they told me that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

3205
02:32:41.951 --> 02:32:46.951
<v Speaker 1>my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can now get that out of my brain now </v>

3206
02:32:46.951 --> 02:32:49.670
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never done that will be a standard </v>

3207
02:32:49.670 --> 02:32:49.670
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just titty fucking fat holds.</v>

3208
02:32:49.860 --> 02:32:51.780
<v Speaker 1>It seems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not shocked at all.</v>

3209
02:32:51.990 --> 02:32:53.750
<v Speaker 1>That didn't even make me feel sick </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3210
02:32:53.751 --> 02:32:55.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these to the.</v>

3211
02:32:55.750 --> 02:33:00.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think has lifted the fat false and </v>

3212
02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:02.190
<v Speaker 1>finding the rest of you from all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>failed attempts it seems.</v>

3213
02:33:02.380 --> 02:33:03.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

3214
02:33:03.091 --> 02:33:05.300
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find a fetus in there.</v>

3215
02:33:05.590 --> 02:33:10.590
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking you were going to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they didn't realize that.</v>

3216
02:33:10.860 --> 02:33:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3217
02:33:11.311 --> 02:33:12.590
<v Speaker 1>You waiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see why.</v>

3218
02:33:12.780 --> 02:33:14.080
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3219
02:33:14.140 --> 02:33:16.440
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about it I gave you that.</v>

3220
02:33:16.510 --> 02:33:17.700
<v Speaker 1>I was someone was that fat.</v>

3221
02:33:17.700 --> 02:33:19.230
<v Speaker 1>Think they're going to take care of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>

3222
02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:24.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the little toddler start running </v>

3223
02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:24.800
<v Speaker 1>around like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you gonna?</v>

3224
02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:26.010
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna do to get your </v>
<v Speaker 1>scooter chase him around the park?</v>

3225
02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you probably stopped then with food</v>

3226
02:33:28.441 --> 02:33:30.000
<v Speaker 1>day and night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll sit next to you.</v>

3227
02:33:30.001 --> 02:33:35.001
<v Speaker 1>One bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 pounds by the time they're three </v>

3228
02:33:35.001 --> 02:33:37.461
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this a bunch of times </v>

3229
02:33:37.461 --> 02:33:37.461
<v Speaker 1>on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

3230
02:33:37.461 --> 02:33:39.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the possibility of overindulging this</v>

3231
02:33:39.991 --> 02:33:42.560
<v Speaker 1>thought I've stopped eating sugar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of.</v>

3232
02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Well I didn't stop but I cut it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cut it out completely for two weeks </v>

3233
02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:48.930
<v Speaker 1>and then I cut it way back since then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I will occasionally,</v>

3234
02:33:49.260 --> 02:33:54.260
<v Speaker 1>every few days or so I'll allow myself </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing like a piece of like this </v>

3235
02:33:54.871 --> 02:33:56.340
<v Speaker 1>chili mangoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3236
02:33:56.430 --> 02:33:58.170
<v Speaker 1>not angels with Chile that has sugar in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3237
02:33:58.290 --> 02:33:59.760
<v Speaker 1>but very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very little sugar.</v>

3238
02:33:59.940 --> 02:34:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I lost like eight pounds from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just doing nothing but that it's not the</v>

3239
02:34:03.961 --> 02:34:06.780
<v Speaker 1>same amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My energy levels completely different.</v>

3240
02:34:06.781 --> 02:34:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Like through the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need.</v>

3241
02:34:08.850 --> 02:34:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't get tired towards the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day anymore.</v>

3242
02:34:11.070 --> 02:34:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just stayed normal.</v>

3243
02:34:12.810 --> 02:34:17.810
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what our nature is fucked up </v>

3244
02:34:17.810 --> 02:34:18.160
<v Speaker 1>because she was dark days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sold them good and yet it's so</v>

3245
02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:19.150
<v Speaker 3>bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3246
02:34:19.151 --> 02:34:24.151
<v Speaker 3>it's supposed to taste good in the form </v>
<v Speaker 3>of fruit because it comes with the </v>

3247
02:34:24.151 --> 02:34:26.560
<v Speaker 3>reward of vitamins and fiber and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>this other good stuff that's in fruit,</v>

3248
02:34:26.890 --> 02:34:30.910
<v Speaker 3>but we somehow or another hijack that </v>
<v Speaker 3>extracted it from the food and shoved it</v>

3249
02:34:30.911 --> 02:34:33.670
<v Speaker 3>into a liquid that comes in a nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>aluminum can.</v>

3250
02:34:33.671 --> 02:34:37.870
<v Speaker 3>You pop the top and you get that corn </v>
<v Speaker 3>syrup right into your heart.</v>

3251
02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:46.110
<v Speaker 3>But the average american diet is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>overflowing with sugar and these poor </v>

3252
02:34:46.271 --> 02:34:51.271
<v Speaker 3>people are just becoming bigger and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fatter and corn syrup and simple sugars </v>

3253
02:34:52.601 --> 02:34:56.710
<v Speaker 3>and they're just overwhelmed with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>excess sugar.</v>

3254
02:34:57.070 --> 02:34:58.590
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the.</v>

3255
02:34:58.660 --> 02:35:03.660
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the primary issue that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people have when it comes to weight </v>

3256
02:35:03.660 --> 02:35:07.081
<v Speaker 3>loss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sugars and simple sugars and </v>

3257
02:35:07.081 --> 02:35:07.750
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

3258
02:35:07.751 --> 02:35:12.751
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a simple carbs like pastas and breads </v>

3259
02:35:12.751 --> 02:35:13.840
<v Speaker 3>and all that stuff which converts to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar,</v>

3260
02:35:13.841 --> 02:35:18.841
<v Speaker 3>alcohol which converts to sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all but probably there's also </v>

3261
02:35:18.841 --> 02:35:21.540
<v Speaker 3>sitting on your ass forever and never </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving because I mean I see.</v>

3262
02:35:21.541 --> 02:35:24.210
<v Speaker 3>I would like when I go back to 8:30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see people</v>

3263
02:35:24.260 --> 02:35:27.290
<v Speaker 2>bulleit and people's lawns throws them </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of past.</v>

3264
02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

3265
02:35:28.250 --> 02:35:29.330
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you even.</v>

3266
02:35:29.630 --> 02:35:32.550
<v Speaker 2>And yet you see them and skinny most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3267
02:35:32.580 --> 02:35:37.580
<v Speaker 2>I see what I eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I wouldn't be like really are </v>

3268
02:35:37.761 --> 02:35:42.761
<v Speaker 2>hitting half the box of the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>were like easy and I feel actually put </v>

3269
02:35:42.761 --> 02:35:42.761
<v Speaker 2>it to good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go forward more.</v>

3270
02:35:42.761 --> 02:35:43.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3271
02:35:43.580 --> 02:35:46.960
<v Speaker 2>do they have the same wheat in it lands </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I have no question marks.</v>

3272
02:35:46.961 --> 02:35:48.590
<v Speaker 2>It's clearly something is different </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3273
02:35:48.591 --> 02:35:50.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something is not because you cannot.</v>

3274
02:35:51.380 --> 02:35:53.660
<v Speaker 2>If it was just the carbs then that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

3275
02:35:53.740 --> 02:35:56.180
<v Speaker 2>should do it then everybody should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge and that's,</v>

3276
02:35:56.181 --> 02:35:58.550
<v Speaker 2>that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So something is going on.</v>

3277
02:35:58.790 --> 02:36:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it even with the like if I </v>

3278
02:36:03.790 --> 02:36:03.860
<v Speaker 2>tomatoes in Italy versus tomatoes out </v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

3279
02:36:04.310 --> 02:36:08.360
<v Speaker 2>tomatoes in Italy are awesome tasting </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they are feeling,</v>

3280
02:36:08.430 --> 02:36:09.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat some tomatoes,</v>

3281
02:36:09.741 --> 02:36:13.080
<v Speaker 2>you feel like that can be a big chunk of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your lunch right there.</v>

3282
02:36:13.380 --> 02:36:18.380
<v Speaker 2>I hate tomatoes here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm drinking water in the </v>

3283
02:36:18.380 --> 02:36:21.381
<v Speaker 2>right package.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they taste like nothing and they </v>

3284
02:36:21.381 --> 02:36:21.381
<v Speaker 2>don't feel me like it's theoretical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same fruit,</v>

3285
02:36:21.381 --> 02:36:26.350
<v Speaker 2>but clearly something has been done </v>
<v Speaker 2>different in the way they have been </v>

3286
02:36:26.350 --> 02:36:26.350
<v Speaker 2>gmos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3287
02:36:26.350 --> 02:36:30.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had no idea why or what.</v>

3288
02:36:30.801 --> 02:36:32.480
<v Speaker 2>But clearly the result is different.</v>

3289
02:36:32.730 --> 02:36:34.050
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>selective breeding.</v>

3290
02:36:34.051 --> 02:36:39.051
<v Speaker 3>I mean they've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've selectively made these tomatoes </v>

3291
02:36:39.051 --> 02:36:40.020
<v Speaker 3>a much more hardy tomato that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>taste very good.</v>

3292
02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've bred out all the juiciness </v>

3293
02:36:45.080 --> 02:36:48.920
<v Speaker 3>because they don't last.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I have some heirloom tomatoes at </v>

3294
02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:48.920
<v Speaker 3>home,</v>
<v Speaker 3>much spot on the other day.</v>

3295
02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:49.590
<v Speaker 3>They're already really soft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to eat them tonight,</v>

3296
02:36:49.890 --> 02:36:54.330
<v Speaker 3>but I think people are lazy and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't go grocery shopping than enough.</v>

3297
02:36:54.331 --> 02:36:56.310
<v Speaker 3>And so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to bike domenico today.</v>

3298
02:36:56.311 --> 02:36:58.150
<v Speaker 3>The last three weeks from now we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna.</v>

3299
02:36:58.170 --> 02:37:03.170
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just as neil and the fact is it's going </v>

3300
02:37:03.170 --> 02:37:03.380
<v Speaker 3>to look new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have no thesis.</v>

3301
02:37:03.510 --> 02:37:06.060
<v Speaker 3>What's really in the shipping?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The shipping is the big issue.</v>

3302
02:37:06.061 --> 02:37:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Like being able to get them across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

3303
02:37:07.721 --> 02:37:08.290
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

3304
02:37:08.300 --> 02:37:10.560
<v Speaker 3>big truck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the heirloom tomatoes,</v>

3305
02:37:10.561 --> 02:37:12.630
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know they existed until,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3306
02:37:13.350 --> 02:37:15.320
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I first one,</v>

3307
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:16.790
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking delicious.</v>

3308
02:37:16.820 --> 02:37:21.820
<v Speaker 3>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what a tomato is supposed to be </v>

3309
02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:21.820
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heck.</v>

3310
02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:23.670
<v Speaker 3>It's like we have this rare to beto.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the way it's all right there.</v>

3311
02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:27.530
<v Speaker 3>I hope we don't run out of heirloom </v>
<v Speaker 3>tomato seeds.</v>

3312
02:37:27.531 --> 02:37:32.531
<v Speaker 3>I would cry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would really cry if we get to a point </v>

3313
02:37:32.531 --> 02:37:35.240
<v Speaker 3>some day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping that with all these like um,</v>

3314
02:37:35.710 --> 02:37:40.710
<v Speaker 3>this is new emphasis on craft </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurants and craft breweries and </v>

3315
02:37:40.710 --> 02:37:41.670
<v Speaker 3>craft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3316
02:37:42.140 --> 02:37:45.200
<v Speaker 3>people are really into like farm to </v>
<v Speaker 3>table restaurants.</v>

3317
02:37:45.201 --> 02:37:50.201
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a great one near me and they </v>

3318
02:37:50.201 --> 02:37:52.871
<v Speaker 3>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get eggs there and the eggs of like a </v>

3319
02:37:52.871 --> 02:37:55.691
<v Speaker 3>dark orange yolk just like my eggs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the food is all from a local farm and </v>

3320
02:37:55.691 --> 02:37:57.860
<v Speaker 3>they'll tell you like what farm they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>sourcing their be from.</v>

3321
02:37:58.040 --> 02:38:03.040
<v Speaker 3>It's a great little restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm hoping that with that sort of </v>

3322
02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:06.890
<v Speaker 3>trend that more and more people embrace </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and then we'll keep the idea alive.</v>

3323
02:38:06.910 --> 02:38:11.030
<v Speaker 3>Have you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real natural foods co.</v>

3324
02:38:11.440 --> 02:38:11.880
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3325
02:38:11.890 --> 02:38:12.380
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's okay.</v>

3326
02:38:12.381 --> 02:38:13.790
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know in other,</v>

3327
02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:16.190
<v Speaker 3>in other ways like things like golden </v>
<v Speaker 3>rice,</v>

3328
02:38:16.191 --> 02:38:18.950
<v Speaker 3>like genetically modified rice that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>much higher in protein.</v>

3329
02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:22.100
<v Speaker 3>That's helped a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kept a lot of people from starving.</v>

3330
02:38:22.470 --> 02:38:23.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for people.</v>

3331
02:38:23.851 --> 02:38:28.851
<v Speaker 2>Having choices is like that thing I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like is when one model become the </v>

3332
02:38:29.310 --> 02:38:34.310
<v Speaker 2>the only model that you don't let </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody else have a choice whether </v>

3333
02:38:34.310 --> 02:38:34.980
<v Speaker 2>there's a problem there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't,</v>

3334
02:38:35.010 --> 02:38:40.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't even care which one is winning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is if you start having a one </v>

3335
02:38:40.010 --> 02:38:40.800
<v Speaker 2>model lead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a problem there.</v>

3336
02:38:41.460 --> 02:38:46.460
<v Speaker 2>So you do have the people who want none </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this shit and we out of the way </v>

3337
02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:50.911
<v Speaker 2>toward the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we're going to saturate the </v>

3338
02:38:50.911 --> 02:38:53.031
<v Speaker 2>market so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we squeeze every other possibility </v>

3339
02:38:53.031 --> 02:38:53.310
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of those are shitty choices.</v>

3340
02:38:53.770 --> 02:38:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Like you want to allow as much choice </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there as possible and in a way to </v>

3341
02:38:58.770 --> 02:39:00.200
<v Speaker 2>doesn't squash all the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>

3342
02:39:00.740 --> 02:39:05.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I read recently and I thought I </v>

3343
02:39:05.740 --> 02:39:07.101
<v Speaker 3>thought it was really interesting is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that mcdonald's is apparently hurting </v>

3344
02:39:07.101 --> 02:39:11.290
<v Speaker 3>like really badly and that their profits</v>
<v Speaker 3>are down radically from like 20 years </v>

3345
02:39:11.391 --> 02:39:16.391
<v Speaker 3>ago and that they're thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually that model of really shitty </v>

3346
02:39:16.391 --> 02:39:21.191
<v Speaker 3>food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fast food is going to be gone and </v>

3347
02:39:21.191 --> 02:39:21.380
<v Speaker 3>they're going to be replaced by things </v>
<v Speaker 3>like in and out burger,</v>

3348
02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:23.990
<v Speaker 3>which is delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They cook it to order,</v>

3349
02:39:24.250 --> 02:39:26.900
<v Speaker 3>takes a little bit more time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's infinitely better.</v>

3350
02:39:26.901 --> 02:39:29.390
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that these five guys,</v>

3351
02:39:29.510 --> 02:39:34.510
<v Speaker 3>places like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the new model and then that's </v>

3352
02:39:34.510 --> 02:39:35.840
<v Speaker 3>what you're going to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the idea is like if you've been</v>

3353
02:39:35.841 --> 02:39:37.750
<v Speaker 3>to lax recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you been flying that?</v>

3354
02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:43.120
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things you notice if you go </v>

3355
02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:44.060
<v Speaker 3>to lax is the restaurant choices have </v>
<v Speaker 3>gotten dramatically better.</v>

3356
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:47.450
<v Speaker 3>Like you can get really good food at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>airport now,</v>

3357
02:39:47.451 --> 02:39:51.020
<v Speaker 3>like really cool restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not chains and like with this is</v>

3358
02:39:51.021 --> 02:39:53.480
<v Speaker 3>a brilliant idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a food truck there.</v>

3359
02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:54.350
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3360
02:39:54.351 --> 02:39:59.351
<v Speaker 3>they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a got a truck of face and </v>

3361
02:39:59.351 --> 02:39:59.351
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3362
02:39:59.351 --> 02:40:03.241
<v Speaker 3>there's a little restaurant behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is they're gonna give you </v>

3363
02:40:03.241 --> 02:40:03.241
<v Speaker 3>food like you would get from a food </v>
<v Speaker 3>truck.</v>

3364
02:40:03.241 --> 02:40:07.630
<v Speaker 3>And so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're establishing this new sort of a,</v>

3365
02:40:07.640 --> 02:40:12.620
<v Speaker 3>a place to get which used to be like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd get chili's,</v>

3366
02:40:12.740 --> 02:40:13.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get like</v>

3367
02:40:14.080 --> 02:40:19.080
<v Speaker 2>applebee's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like chain restaurants or </v>

3368
02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:19.080
<v Speaker 2>mcdonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

3369
02:40:19.080 --> 02:40:20.160
<v Speaker 2>But now you get like a really nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>salad.</v>

3370
02:40:20.440 --> 02:40:24.780
<v Speaker 2>You can get us a kale salad with real </v>
<v Speaker 2>cucumbers and stuff on it and stuff.</v>

3371
02:40:25.110 --> 02:40:30.110
<v Speaker 2>I think people are realizing that just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because this is the only way we've had </v>

3372
02:40:30.181 --> 02:40:32.730
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to have it this way.</v>

3373
02:40:33.210 --> 02:40:34.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw this thing on one.</v>

3374
02:40:34.831 --> 02:40:39.831
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anthony bourdain's shows was on san </v>

3375
02:40:39.831 --> 02:40:41.190
<v Speaker 2>francisco and one of the guys that runs </v>
<v Speaker 2>this really nice restaurant was going to</v>

3376
02:40:41.191 --> 02:40:44.490
<v Speaker 2>open up an all vegetarian healthy food </v>
<v Speaker 2>option,</v>

3377
02:40:44.491 --> 02:40:49.491
<v Speaker 2>a very cheap place in the tenderloin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the worst places in san </v>

3378
02:40:49.491 --> 02:40:53.691
<v Speaker 2>francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the menu was going to vary between </v>

3379
02:40:53.691 --> 02:40:53.691
<v Speaker 2>two and $6.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it,</v>

3380
02:40:53.691 --> 02:40:58.670
<v Speaker 2>and everything on the menu is between </v>
<v Speaker 2>two and $6 and they had like a really </v>

3381
02:40:58.670 --> 02:41:00.000
<v Speaker 2>healthy veggie burger that actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>tasted good,</v>

3382
02:41:00.001 --> 02:41:01.740
<v Speaker 2>like more dean eight one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

3383
02:41:01.741 --> 02:41:06.741
<v Speaker 2>this is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would actually go this and they're </v>

3384
02:41:06.741 --> 02:41:09.180
<v Speaker 2>going to try to provide healthy semi </v>
<v Speaker 2>fast food for people think that that's a</v>

3385
02:41:09.181 --> 02:41:14.181
<v Speaker 2>good idea I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not that difficult because a </v>

3386
02:41:14.181 --> 02:41:14.580
<v Speaker 2>lot of healthy stuff.</v>

3387
02:41:14.850 --> 02:41:17.640
<v Speaker 2>There's the stereotype that all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other stuff is crazy expensive.</v>

3388
02:41:17.700 --> 02:41:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Not all of it is just a method of </v>
<v Speaker 2>digging enough of finding scenes that </v>

3389
02:41:22.700 --> 02:41:26.721
<v Speaker 2>can be nutritious ratios and not crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive because there are those </v>

3390
02:41:26.721 --> 02:41:27.190
<v Speaker 2>options is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seemed pull off all.</v>

3391
02:41:27.191 --> 02:41:32.191
<v Speaker 2>You need to have a bank in order to hit </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lt or you eat cheaply crop there.</v>

3392
02:41:32.510 --> 02:41:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Samo feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's who,</v>

3393
02:41:33.571 --> 02:41:38.571
<v Speaker 2>but not completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are options where you can eat </v>

3394
02:41:38.571 --> 02:41:41.090
<v Speaker 2>delicious meals that you like to cook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done things to like when they think</v>

3395
02:41:41.611 --> 02:41:46.611
<v Speaker 2>about what I just spent and it's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his fucking deletions and this good </v>

3396
02:41:46.611 --> 02:41:47.070
<v Speaker 2>food and there's no trade shows and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3397
02:41:48.120 --> 02:41:49.510
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong with that plan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3398
02:41:49.530 --> 02:41:51.250
<v Speaker 2>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we'd,</v>

3399
02:41:51.260 --> 02:41:53.340
<v Speaker 2>what you were saying earlier also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that intrigued me.</v>

3400
02:41:53.341 --> 02:41:58.341
<v Speaker 2>Something I've been obsessed in a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The distance that goes from people </v>

3401
02:41:58.341 --> 02:42:00.180
<v Speaker 2>eating the food to the food to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced.</v>

3402
02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:02.340
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean just how far it </v>
<v Speaker 2>travels,</v>

3403
02:42:02.341 --> 02:42:03.870
<v Speaker 2>but even out disconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are,</v>

3404
02:42:03.871 --> 02:42:08.871
<v Speaker 2>I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it comes from three miles from </v>

3405
02:42:08.871 --> 02:42:08.871
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's bad there of course,</v>

3406
02:42:08.871 --> 02:42:09.990
<v Speaker 2>but I mean through the idea of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>live in,</v>

3407
02:42:09.991 --> 02:42:12.960
<v Speaker 2>at least to some degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some contact with the food you eat.</v>

3408
02:42:12.961 --> 02:42:15.270
<v Speaker 2>So you do have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's,</v>

3409
02:42:15.620 --> 02:42:20.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy who I had remembered you added </v>

3410
02:42:20.620 --> 02:42:22.880
<v Speaker 2>on the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the image of the guy that landed the </v>

3411
02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:23.970
<v Speaker 2>vertical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woods or whatever they call it,</v>

3412
02:42:23.971 --> 02:42:24.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

3413
02:42:24.721 --> 02:42:29.721
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it looked like a skyscraper where </v>

3414
02:42:29.721 --> 02:42:29.880
<v Speaker 2>they bought a bunch of trees all over it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was you.</v>

3415
02:42:31.720 --> 02:42:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Why don't these plans now was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to um,</v>

3416
02:42:36.330 --> 02:42:41.330
<v Speaker 2>put on all the rooftops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put gardens so that people can have </v>

3417
02:42:41.330 --> 02:42:45.291
<v Speaker 2>their vegetable gardens even on top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like four story buildings or something </v>

3418
02:42:45.291 --> 02:42:47.040
<v Speaker 2>that there can be the building garden </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everybody goes.</v>

3419
02:42:47.070 --> 02:42:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't know how he's going to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of what that was.</v>

3420
02:42:49.351 --> 02:42:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Mike domenico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>

3421
02:42:50.431 --> 02:42:54.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm going kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But having that idea where it may not be</v>

3422
02:42:54.421 --> 02:42:59.421
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are not self sufficient is not all </v>

3423
02:42:59.421 --> 02:43:01.611
<v Speaker 2>of your food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have some contact with the food </v>

3424
02:43:01.611 --> 02:43:01.830
<v Speaker 2>that you're indicating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody,</v>

3425
02:43:01.831 --> 02:43:06.831
<v Speaker 2>should I wait to one degree or another </v>
<v Speaker 2>in powershell it's hard because most </v>

3426
02:43:06.831 --> 02:43:09.801
<v Speaker 2>people don't have the space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the situation to the weight in their </v>

3427
02:43:09.801 --> 02:43:13.281
<v Speaker 2>backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But figuring out ways on the cheap to </v>

3428
02:43:13.281 --> 02:43:17.400
<v Speaker 2>make that up and figure out ways on an </v>
<v Speaker 2>architectural standpoint on it,</v>

3429
02:43:17.590 --> 02:43:21.790
<v Speaker 2>multiple ways to try to make the link </v>
<v Speaker 2>between people and eating food,</v>

3430
02:43:21.791 --> 02:43:26.791
<v Speaker 2>the direct ones so that people have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of where food comes from and that </v>

3431
02:43:26.791 --> 02:43:27.940
<v Speaker 2>they raise their own food to one degree </v>
<v Speaker 2>or another.</v>

3432
02:43:28.570 --> 02:43:33.570
<v Speaker 2>I think that would be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how realistic that these </v>

3433
02:43:33.570 --> 02:43:36.061
<v Speaker 2>are our practical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why not take a few steps in that </v>

3434
02:43:36.061 --> 02:43:36.070
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Figure out how we can be done.</v>

3435
02:43:36.210 --> 02:43:41.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean everyone who has a backyard </v>

3436
02:43:41.210 --> 02:43:41.210
<v Speaker 3>should have a garden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3437
02:43:41.210 --> 02:43:45.570
<v Speaker 3>It's not that difficult to grow </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and just even if you only grow</v>

3438
02:43:45.571 --> 02:43:48.600
<v Speaker 3>a meal a month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a salad,</v>

3439
02:43:48.700 --> 02:43:53.700
<v Speaker 3>just something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something particularly satisfying </v>

3440
02:43:53.700 --> 02:43:54.840
<v Speaker 3>about picking a cucumber that you grew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chopping it up,</v>

3441
02:43:54.841 --> 02:43:58.090
<v Speaker 3>putting in a sal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cooking a squash that you grew this.</v>

3442
02:43:58.130 --> 02:43:59.850
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really nice.</v>

3443
02:44:00.090 --> 02:44:01.680
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's primal.</v>

3444
02:44:01.681 --> 02:44:06.681
<v Speaker 3>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it connects us in some sort of a way to </v>

3445
02:44:06.681 --> 02:44:06.681
<v Speaker 3>shade it a lot more.</v>

3446
02:44:07.110 --> 02:44:10.670
<v Speaker 2>You remember all the time and energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that went into getting this stuff</v>

3447
02:44:10.670 --> 02:44:12.590
<v Speaker 3>from these big two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you're like,</v>

3448
02:44:12.620 --> 02:44:14.090
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>

3449
02:44:14.091 --> 02:44:17.600
<v Speaker 3>there's a story behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend remy warren was on the podcast</v>

3450
02:44:17.601 --> 02:44:22.601
<v Speaker 3>yesterday and he has a show on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>outdoor channel called a apex predator </v>

3451
02:44:23.210 --> 02:44:28.210
<v Speaker 3>and it's all about he follows these </v>
<v Speaker 3>different animals and tries to learn how</v>

3452
02:44:29.631 --> 02:44:34.631
<v Speaker 3>they hunt and how they survive and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of them was about bears and he had </v>

3453
02:44:35.501 --> 02:44:40.501
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he tried to forage the way a bear </v>

3454
02:44:40.501 --> 02:44:42.170
<v Speaker 3>forages and he was shocked by how little</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could find to eat,</v>

3455
02:44:42.590 --> 02:44:47.590
<v Speaker 3>like you know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we were talking and he was saying,</v>

3456
02:44:47.930 --> 02:44:50.330
<v Speaker 3>you look around at all these plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere we look,</v>

3457
02:44:50.331 --> 02:44:52.520
<v Speaker 3>we see trees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bushes and garden,</v>

3458
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:57.550
<v Speaker 3>but none of it you can eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like why do we grow so many plants that </v>

3459
02:44:57.550 --> 02:45:00.140
<v Speaker 3>we could just grow food everywhere?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

3460
02:45:00.170 --> 02:45:01.310
<v Speaker 3>I never even thought about that.</v>

3461
02:45:01.310 --> 02:45:05.900
<v Speaker 3>Like instead of palm trees have food,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trees everywhere.</v>

3462
02:45:05.901 --> 02:45:08.060
<v Speaker 3>Food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine if everyone,</v>

3463
02:45:08.660 --> 02:45:10.700
<v Speaker 3>anywhere you looked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere you go,</v>

3464
02:45:10.850 --> 02:45:13.730
<v Speaker 3>there was grapes growing and tomatoes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3465
02:45:13.731 --> 02:45:14.240
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3466
02:45:14.300 --> 02:45:17.600
<v Speaker 3>and fucking peaches and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

3467
02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:20.450
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree 110 percent.</v>

3468
02:45:20.451 --> 02:45:21.480
<v Speaker 3>With that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's we,</v>

3469
02:45:21.770 --> 02:45:26.770
<v Speaker 3>we need to work in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets totally possible if there's all </v>

3470
02:45:26.770 --> 02:45:27.980
<v Speaker 3>these bushes and trees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every,</v>

3471
02:45:28.490 --> 02:45:31.010
<v Speaker 3>every city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Street has bushes and trees and.</v>

3472
02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:33.400
<v Speaker 3>But none of them are growing food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

3473
02:45:33.940 --> 02:45:35.130
<v Speaker 3>Science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it.</v>

3474
02:45:35.240 --> 02:45:37.290
<v Speaker 3>And it's not like those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like an apple trees,</v>

3475
02:45:37.310 --> 02:45:39.330
<v Speaker 3>a beautiful tree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a cherry tree.</v>

3476
02:45:39.331 --> 02:45:41.520
<v Speaker 3>That's a beautiful tree though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't we do.</v>

3477
02:45:41.570 --> 02:45:43.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't go to data.</v>

3478
02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:49.720
<v Speaker 3>It's strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like somewhere along the line we </v>

3479
02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:49.720
<v Speaker 3>lost the plot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3480
02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:50.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing a bunch of shit we don't need.</v>

3481
02:45:50.450 --> 02:45:52.780
<v Speaker 3>That seemed like a really smart concept </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

3482
02:45:52.790 --> 02:45:53.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's.</v>

3483
02:45:53.451 --> 02:45:54.530
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3484
02:45:54.531 --> 02:45:59.531
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange that we don't have </v>

3485
02:45:59.531 --> 02:46:03.041
<v Speaker 3>food around us all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we have to rely on it getting </v>

3486
02:46:03.041 --> 02:46:03.041
<v Speaker 3>shipped in and trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

3487
02:46:03.041 --> 02:46:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean seriously,</v>

3488
02:46:03.411 --> 02:46:07.370
<v Speaker 2>like any major american city or math or </v>
<v Speaker 2>most cities in the lord,</v>

3489
02:46:07.660 --> 02:46:12.660
<v Speaker 2>our [inaudible] fire away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are one big blackout away from </v>

3490
02:46:12.660 --> 02:46:14.620
<v Speaker 2>everybody turning into the walking dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3491
02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:18.950
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing things get really ugly </v>
<v Speaker 2>really quick because noboDy has any idea</v>

3492
02:46:18.951 --> 02:46:21.420
<v Speaker 2>how to get food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Danielle,</v>

3493
02:46:21.610 --> 02:46:23.420
<v Speaker 2>ebola,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we have to end on a low note?</v>

3494
02:46:23.610 --> 02:46:24.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's piCk up.</v>

3495
02:46:24.910 --> 02:46:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're almost out of time.</v>

3496
02:46:26.380 --> 02:46:28.070
<v Speaker 2>That's very little time here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Left.</v>

3497
02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:29.720
<v Speaker 2>What do you got there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the book you got?</v>

3498
02:46:29.810 --> 02:46:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

3499
02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:31.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3500
02:46:31.550 --> 02:46:36.550
<v Speaker 2>this is a book about caravaggio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the italian painter I'm doing because I </v>

3501
02:46:36.550 --> 02:46:38.060
<v Speaker 2>put up here a bunch of research for </v>
<v Speaker 2>history on fire.</v>

3502
02:46:38.061 --> 02:46:43.061
<v Speaker 2>I prepare a lot of research ahead </v>
<v Speaker 2>because otherwise with dan carlin ended </v>

3503
02:46:43.061 --> 02:46:46.271
<v Speaker 2>up doing is that you do need to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>this humongous gaps between one episode </v>

3504
02:46:46.271 --> 02:46:50.021
<v Speaker 2>and the next to research because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes as doing the math the other day </v>

3505
02:46:50.021 --> 02:46:53.681
<v Speaker 2>just because I was bored and I figure it</v>
<v Speaker 2>take me to produce a two hour episode </v>

3506
02:46:53.681 --> 02:46:53.690
<v Speaker 2>for history and fire.</v>

3507
02:46:53.690 --> 02:46:58.690
<v Speaker 2>It takes me probably about 200 hours of </v>
<v Speaker 2>work have shown and research and read </v>

3508
02:46:58.690 --> 02:47:00.320
<v Speaker 2>the book and take the notes and do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that.</v>

3509
02:47:00.750 --> 02:47:02.060
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a fulltime job.</v>

3510
02:47:02.061 --> 02:47:04.870
<v Speaker 2>I can release episodes often if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3511
02:47:05.050 --> 02:47:10.050
<v Speaker 2>if I'm doing other thIngs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I did is for the last two years </v>

3512
02:47:10.050 --> 02:47:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I basically prepare to start history on </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire.</v>

3513
02:47:11.820 --> 02:47:14.960
<v Speaker 2>So you knew you were going to do this </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the last couple of years?</v>

3514
02:47:14.961 --> 02:47:16.950
<v Speaker 2>I've been working at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not all the time,</v>

3515
02:47:16.951 --> 02:47:21.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I do another thing and now I can </v>

3516
02:47:21.951 --> 02:47:24.280
<v Speaker 2>get to bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I basically prepare eight episodes </v>

3517
02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:24.400
<v Speaker 2>so I would have the research ready to </v>
<v Speaker 2>roll,</v>

3518
02:47:24.750 --> 02:47:28.640
<v Speaker 2>just need to record data and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he buys me a little time.</v>

3519
02:47:28.641 --> 02:47:33.641
<v Speaker 2>So I kind of released that these old 76 </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks now until eventually the research </v>

3520
02:47:33.681 --> 02:47:36.530
<v Speaker 2>catch up with the ana done carlene </v>
<v Speaker 2>skylar.</v>

3521
02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:41.560
<v Speaker 2>But hopefully I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm researching episode denying </v>

3522
02:47:41.560 --> 02:47:42.230
<v Speaker 2>the well I am on steel on episode two is</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

3523
02:47:42.260 --> 02:47:45.500
<v Speaker 2>it's like trying to eventually will </v>
<v Speaker 2>catch up,</v>

3524
02:47:45.501 --> 02:47:47.900
<v Speaker 2>which they probably won't be that long </v>
<v Speaker 2>until catch up with me,</v>

3525
02:47:47.901 --> 02:47:52.901
<v Speaker 2>but until then by deleveraging episodes </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a relatively often scared or I can </v>

3526
02:47:53.841 --> 02:47:58.841
<v Speaker 2>also hook up more people and by that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point they may be more forgiving if I </v>

3527
02:47:58.841 --> 02:48:02.830
<v Speaker 2>take longer to do the research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's such an intensive style of </v>

3528
02:48:02.830 --> 02:48:04.940
<v Speaker 2>podcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really like not just educational,</v>

3529
02:48:04.941 --> 02:48:06.390
<v Speaker 2>but it's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3530
02:48:06.470 --> 02:48:09.470
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of doing a lecture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an audio lecture.</v>

3531
02:48:09.650 --> 02:48:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did when I did that too.</v>

3532
02:48:12.140 --> 02:48:14.810
<v Speaker 2>I was really happy with episode one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought kicks ass.</v>

3533
02:48:14.811 --> 02:48:19.811
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's every single I wanted that I </v>

3534
02:48:19.811 --> 02:48:19.940
<v Speaker 2>picture in my mind is coming on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did episode two,</v>

3535
02:48:19.950 --> 02:48:23.070
<v Speaker 2>I listened to it and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a b effort.</v>

3536
02:48:23.440 --> 02:48:26.780
<v Speaker 2>This is not what I wanted and buy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did the whole thing.</v>

3537
02:48:26.781 --> 02:48:28.760
<v Speaker 2>I recorded over a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3538
02:48:28.890 --> 02:48:30.340
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on iT.</v>

3539
02:48:30.410 --> 02:48:31.580
<v Speaker 2>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

3540
02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Fucking delete and start over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3541
02:48:34.220 --> 02:48:35.270
<v Speaker 2>You deleted it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3542
02:48:35.360 --> 02:48:36.110
<v Speaker 2>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3543
02:48:36.111 --> 02:48:37.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do a specialty.</v>

3544
02:48:37.970 --> 02:48:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in general,</v>

3545
02:48:39.861 --> 02:48:44.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to release it and then delete </v>

3546
02:48:44.861 --> 02:48:44.861
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just recorded it.</v>

3547
02:48:44.861 --> 02:48:45.770
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're about to put the intro,</v>

3548
02:48:45.771 --> 02:48:47.270
<v Speaker 2>the outro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>

3549
02:48:47.271 --> 02:48:49.640
<v Speaker 2>And I was listening and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3550
02:48:49.641 --> 02:48:52.580
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have that punch that I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

3551
02:48:53.030 --> 02:48:53.840
<v Speaker 2>and so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3552
02:48:53.841 --> 02:48:57.400
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it on an outline or like,</v>

3553
02:48:57.410 --> 02:48:58.220
<v Speaker 2>how do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3554
02:48:58.221 --> 02:49:03.221
<v Speaker 2>it's a fairly detailed outline now you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to date because of course </v>

3555
02:49:03.221 --> 02:49:07.331
<v Speaker 2>then it doesn't sound natural,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you and I have a pretty clear of </v>

3556
02:49:07.331 --> 02:49:08.970
<v Speaker 2>where we are going and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you haven't eaten a quotation that</v>

3557
02:49:08.971 --> 02:49:10.260
<v Speaker 2>you need to call it is right there.</v>

3558
02:49:10.260 --> 02:49:12.210
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know exacTly where it's going.</v>

3559
02:49:12.211 --> 02:49:16.440
<v Speaker 2>So it's same ice cream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you do it where you can.</v>

3560
02:49:16.441 --> 02:49:18.840
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like if I deliver a lecture</v>
<v Speaker 2>in class,</v>

3561
02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:20.670
<v Speaker 2>I'll take a peek at my notes and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3562
02:49:20.671 --> 02:49:25.671
<v Speaker 2>that's what I need to go next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you deliver it in a more </v>

3563
02:49:25.671 --> 02:49:28.431
<v Speaker 2>natural style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a good chunk of notes.</v>

3564
02:49:28.590 --> 02:49:30.300
<v Speaker 2>But then of course you don't read the </v>
<v Speaker 2>notes,</v>

3565
02:49:30.301 --> 02:49:35.301
<v Speaker 2>you just have them there as a to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>you on track so that you know where </v>

3566
02:49:35.301 --> 02:49:37.020
<v Speaker 2>you're going next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd be really curious to see if your</v>

3567
02:49:37.021 --> 02:49:39.000
<v Speaker 2>accent is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By episode nine.</v>

3568
02:49:40.160 --> 02:49:43.170
<v Speaker 2>I honestly duct is going to change </v>
<v Speaker 2>because again,</v>

3569
02:49:43.230 --> 02:49:44.730
<v Speaker 2>if I could direct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3570
02:49:44.740 --> 02:49:47.490
<v Speaker 2>actually I got in trouble because I say </v>
<v Speaker 2>you told your podcast.</v>

3571
02:49:47.491 --> 02:49:49.380
<v Speaker 2>I think the first time I was on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>

3572
02:49:49.381 --> 02:49:50.650
<v Speaker 2>that as a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3573
02:49:50.770 --> 02:49:52.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to speak perfect english.</v>

3574
02:49:52.710 --> 02:49:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm using good for women.</v>

3575
02:49:54.420 --> 02:49:56.550
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people took it seriously.</v>

3576
02:49:56.551 --> 02:49:59.270
<v Speaker 2>They thought that I really like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>pig.</v>

3577
02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And might affect.</v>

3578
02:50:00.630 --> 02:50:03.120
<v Speaker 2>If I could pull that off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will actually would do it because it's</v>

3579
02:50:03.121 --> 02:50:04.490
<v Speaker 2>still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I couldn't go that way,</v>

3580
02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:06.180
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's really just like,</v>

3581
02:50:06.181 --> 02:50:11.181
<v Speaker 2>don't theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you have a green light to do it </v>

3582
02:50:11.181 --> 02:50:11.970
<v Speaker 2>because you're italian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started to move to Italy and I started</v>

3583
02:50:11.971 --> 02:50:14.430
<v Speaker 2>talking like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I will be a poser,</v>

3584
02:50:15.420 --> 02:50:20.420
<v Speaker 2>poser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact he's also eat would take an </v>

3585
02:50:20.420 --> 02:50:21.660
<v Speaker 2>insane amount of work to change because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hear it,</v>

3586
02:50:21.661 --> 02:50:26.661
<v Speaker 2>so I would have to really sit down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just spend four over dwayne and that you</v>

3587
02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:32.600
<v Speaker 2>have the most extreme version of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely fluent english language that </v>

3588
02:50:32.600 --> 02:50:37.011
<v Speaker 2>I've ever heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have anthony bourdain's wife is from </v>

3589
02:50:37.011 --> 02:50:38.970
<v Speaker 2>Italy and she has a very strong italian </v>
<v Speaker 2>accent,</v>

3590
02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:44.000
<v Speaker 2>but she's way clear than you have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends for a long time,</v>

3591
02:50:46.681 --> 02:50:48.360
<v Speaker 2>so I know exactly what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying.</v>

3592
02:50:48.360 --> 02:50:50.700
<v Speaker 2>But if I didn't know you I'd probably be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3593
02:50:50.910 --> 02:50:55.910
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck did he just say that art </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a flow to it though people have zero </v>

3594
02:50:59.560 --> 02:51:01.140
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people are like,</v>

3595
02:51:01.170 --> 02:51:02.840
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand everything you say,</v>

3596
02:51:02.841 --> 02:51:07.841
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there are people who have no </v>

3597
02:51:07.841 --> 02:51:07.841
<v Speaker 2>idea of what one word I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had the,</v>

3598
02:51:07.900 --> 02:51:10.550
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend and I were talking on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone and they're like,</v>

3599

3602
02:51:15.251 --> 02:51:20.251
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking of making some salomon </v>

3603
02:51:20.251 --> 02:51:20.251
<v Speaker 2>and they were like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Salmaan or like.</v>

3608

3611
02:51:40.290 --> 02:51:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3612
02:51:40.861 --> 02:51:41.830
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one,</v>

3613
02:51:42.060 --> 02:51:43.380
<v Speaker 2>but I can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3614
02:51:43.650 --> 02:51:45.380
<v Speaker 2>and no one says sam edelman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3615
02:51:45.600 --> 02:51:50.600
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not how you say you were making </v>

3616
02:51:50.600 --> 02:51:52.101
<v Speaker 2>up words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spell out every single thing because </v>

3617
02:51:52.101 --> 02:51:52.650
<v Speaker 2>you need that in every lecture that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3618
02:51:52.651 --> 02:51:56.910
<v Speaker 2>It's meant to be pronounced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you read every single them let her in</v>

3619
02:51:56.911 --> 02:52:01.911
<v Speaker 2>english.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the case and so that's </v>

3620
02:52:01.911 --> 02:52:04.370
<v Speaker 2>confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's also some weird things like </v>

3621
02:52:04.370 --> 02:52:04.770
<v Speaker 2>two c's or an h,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two r.</v>

3622
02:52:04.780 --> 02:52:06.010
<v Speaker 2>YeAh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And two</v>

3623
02:52:06.010 --> 02:52:08.650
<v Speaker 3>l's or a walk or thIngs get weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

3624
02:52:08.880 --> 02:52:12.140
<v Speaker 3>That's the phonetic differences between </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way letters like,</v>

3625
02:52:12.490 --> 02:52:17.490
<v Speaker 3>like that's a big issue obviously with </v>
<v Speaker 3>portuguese to english too with the </v>

3626
02:52:17.490 --> 02:52:21.150
<v Speaker 3>brazilians are the ares or hs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything gets very weird when you try </v>

3627
02:52:21.150 --> 02:52:25.681
<v Speaker 3>to translate it baCk and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that was what I wanted to ask you </v>

3628
02:52:25.681 --> 02:52:25.681
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

3629
02:52:25.681 --> 02:52:28.960
<v Speaker 3>I'd actually forgotten when we were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about translating,</v>

3630
02:52:28.961 --> 02:52:33.961
<v Speaker 3>when you're talking about the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between learning english and seeing how </v>

3631
02:52:33.961 --> 02:52:37.060
<v Speaker 3>short and abrupt the sentences are as </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposed to like the italian.</v>

3632
02:52:37.690 --> 02:52:42.040
<v Speaker 3>How difficult is it when they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>translating ancient historical texts?</v>

3633
02:52:42.160 --> 02:52:43.790
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3634
02:52:43.791 --> 02:52:46.390
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why a lot of translations are,</v>

3635
02:52:46.391 --> 02:52:47.420
<v Speaker 3>it's an art form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3636
02:52:47.440 --> 02:52:52.440
<v Speaker 3>some translators are awesome and who </v>
<v Speaker 3>knows if they are really true to the </v>

3637
02:52:52.440 --> 02:52:55.780
<v Speaker 3>original language but late do something </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing and some don't.</v>

3638
02:52:56.620 --> 02:52:59.320
<v Speaker 3>It's a I love about achieving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3639
02:52:59.321 --> 02:53:01.930
<v Speaker 3>when you're ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some translatIons are painful.</v>

3640
02:53:01.931 --> 02:53:04.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this is boring as hell.</v>

3641
02:53:04.121 --> 02:53:06.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they are talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you read the next translation is the</v>

3642
02:53:06.791 --> 02:53:09.550
<v Speaker 3>best book I've ever read and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can that even be?</v>

3643
02:53:09.680 --> 02:53:13.160
<v Speaker 3>But well there's some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>artistic license and the trends,</v>

3644
02:53:13.390 --> 02:53:18.390
<v Speaker 3>translations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what it is and that's what it </v>

3645
02:53:18.390 --> 02:53:22.110
<v Speaker 3>really kind of has to be taken into </v>
<v Speaker 3>account when you're talking about any </v>

3646
02:53:22.110 --> 02:53:22.480
<v Speaker 3>really ancient thing that it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an,</v>

3647
02:53:22.540 --> 02:53:24.220
<v Speaker 3>an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a language you have to take into account</v>

3648
02:53:24.221 --> 02:53:27.640
<v Speaker 3>the time that they wrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way people communicated back then.</v>

3649
02:53:27.700 --> 02:53:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Even if you read ancient english stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the way they talked.</v>

3650
02:53:31.781 --> 02:53:34.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean even just read the declaration of</v>
<v Speaker 3>independence,</v>

3651
02:53:34.540 --> 02:53:37.420
<v Speaker 3>the way people describe things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicate.</v>

3652
02:53:37.421 --> 02:53:38.650
<v Speaker 3>It's odd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

3653
02:53:38.710 --> 02:53:41.640
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to wrap your head around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3654
02:53:41.800 --> 02:53:42.930
<v Speaker 3>big time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3655
02:53:43.020 --> 02:53:48.020
<v Speaker 3>it's a translation from one culture to </v>
<v Speaker 3>another one time period to another and </v>

3656
02:53:48.371 --> 02:53:51.910
<v Speaker 3>all of those combined like ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>italian literature,</v>

3657
02:53:52.420 --> 02:53:55.270
<v Speaker 3>translating that into modern american </v>
<v Speaker 3>english.</v>

3658
02:53:55.271 --> 02:53:57.780
<v Speaker 3>It's gotta be like super bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3659
02:53:57.781 --> 02:54:00.890
<v Speaker 3>You are kind of rewriting it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>

3660
02:54:01.040 --> 02:54:05.150
<v Speaker 3>It's a cooperation between the writer </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the translator and it's a.</v>

3661
02:54:05.740 --> 02:54:10.740
<v Speaker 3>That's why when I don't are lots of </v>
<v Speaker 3>books that I read in italian because my </v>

3662
02:54:10.740 --> 02:54:13.891
<v Speaker 3>english stock and I couldn't read it </v>
<v Speaker 3>read in english and when I finally got </v>

3663
02:54:13.891 --> 02:54:13.891
<v Speaker 3>through to them in english,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3664
02:54:13.891 --> 02:54:17.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another book that's completely </v>

3665
02:54:17.850 --> 02:54:17.850
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are some similarities,</v>

3666
02:54:17.850 --> 02:54:20.680
<v Speaker 3>but it's a whole different style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not even close.</v>

3667
02:54:21.070 --> 02:54:22.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think that would be the case.</v>

3668
02:54:23.020 --> 02:54:25.000
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With the bible,</v>

3669
02:54:25.110 --> 02:54:27.190
<v Speaker 3>they'll like to really understand the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bible.</v>

3670
02:54:27.191 --> 02:54:30.750
<v Speaker 3>You hAve to truly understand like </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever translation.</v>

3671
02:54:30.750 --> 02:54:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like aramaic,</v>

3672
02:54:31.820 --> 02:54:34.360
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to like truly understand </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient hebrew,</v>

3673
02:54:34.970 --> 02:54:37.300
<v Speaker 3>but ancient hebrew is like a real </v>
<v Speaker 3>squirrely language anyway.</v>

3674
02:54:37.301 --> 02:54:40.030
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody pixi pick secondly the way.</v>

3675
02:54:40.031 --> 02:54:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Well as a sweet kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of guesswork.</v>

3676
02:54:43.300 --> 02:54:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3677
02:54:44.151 --> 02:54:46.390
<v Speaker 3>this one of the weirdest ones because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also a number.</v>

3678
02:54:46.870 --> 02:54:50.350
<v Speaker 3>It's a numerical language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the literature is the number one,</v>

3679
02:54:50.351 --> 02:54:53.650
<v Speaker 3>they don't have numbers or letters </v>
<v Speaker 3>served as numbers as well,</v>

3680
02:54:53.651 --> 02:54:58.651
<v Speaker 3>so it's like words had numerical value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good luck that I was laying in bed and </v>

3681
02:54:59.350 --> 02:55:04.350
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of words today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lIke there's a debate about what </v>

3682
02:55:04.350 --> 02:55:04.490
<v Speaker 3>percentage are still</v>

3683
02:55:04.820 --> 02:55:06.980
<v Speaker 1>under debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3684
02:55:06.981 --> 02:55:11.981
<v Speaker 1>And so like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it actually means and what it </v>

3685
02:55:11.981 --> 02:55:13.841
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but imagine if you could learn ancient </v>

3686
02:55:13.841 --> 02:55:17.750
<v Speaker 1>hebrew like exactly how they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you would understand what they were</v>

3687
02:55:17.751 --> 02:55:20.300
<v Speaker 1>trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even then you wouldn't understand it</v>

3688
02:55:20.301 --> 02:55:24.890
<v Speaker 1>unless you were in the context of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture that existed when acute.</v>

3689
02:55:24.891 --> 02:55:27.350
<v Speaker 1>You had to know how they thought about </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

3690
02:55:27.351 --> 02:55:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why most of the time you have to.</v>

3691
02:55:30.770 --> 02:55:35.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't really know what that guy said</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you are these translational sound </v>

3692
02:55:35.770 --> 02:55:36.500
<v Speaker 1>bath or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll go with that one,</v>

3693
02:55:36.501 --> 02:55:38.090
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know which one they meant.</v>

3694
02:55:38.420 --> 02:55:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be one of the really most </v>

3695
02:55:43.420 --> 02:55:44.981
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most difficult aspects about </v>

3696
02:55:44.981 --> 02:55:46.961
<v Speaker 1>history too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was written by people who </v>

3697
02:55:46.961 --> 02:55:49.751
<v Speaker 1>decided how they wanted people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the turn of events and exactly </v>

3698
02:55:49.751 --> 02:55:52.190
<v Speaker 1>whether or not that's exactly how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>went down.</v>

3699
02:55:52.370 --> 02:55:57.370
<v Speaker 1>There are cases where there's like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>egyptian guy who left the record of </v>

3700
02:55:57.370 --> 02:55:57.370
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3701
02:55:57.370 --> 02:56:01.481
<v Speaker 1>we meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've met the hittites and were kicking </v>

3702
02:56:01.481 --> 02:56:02.780
<v Speaker 1>her ass if we wipe them out and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharaoh is the best that the jewelry,</v>

3703
02:56:02.781 --> 02:56:05.120
<v Speaker 1>the hittite accountant that does not </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like,</v>

3704
02:56:08.290 --> 02:56:13.290
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know what the fuck really </v>

3705
02:56:13.290 --> 02:56:15.401
<v Speaker 1>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we will have this vague sense of </v>

3706
02:56:15.401 --> 02:56:15.540
<v Speaker 1>what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know like facts,</v>

3707
02:56:15.550 --> 02:56:18.230
<v Speaker 1>like these people aren't around anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so somebody killed them,</v>

3708
02:56:18.700 --> 02:56:23.700
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we found this pile of bones and </v>

3709
02:56:23.700 --> 02:56:25.340
<v Speaker 1>this is where we think we found troy </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is a spot like,</v>

3710
02:56:25.550 --> 02:56:30.550
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a ton off guesswork involved in </v>

3711
02:56:30.550 --> 02:56:30.550
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3712
02:56:30.550 --> 02:56:32.480
<v Speaker 1>we make it sound like it's this super </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard science and you know,</v>

3713
02:56:32.481 --> 02:56:34.340
<v Speaker 1>you want to be as scientific as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>

3714
02:56:34.341 --> 02:56:36.530
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of guesswork at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the day.</v>

3715
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:40.460
<v Speaker 1>That's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird that we're trying to piece</v>

3716
02:56:40.461 --> 02:56:43.460
<v Speaker 1>together the past to understand how we </v>
<v Speaker 1>got here.</v>

3717
02:56:43.700 --> 02:56:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Almost like a giant crime scene of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

3718
02:56:46.311 --> 02:56:51.311
<v Speaker 1>yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're slowly like brushing fingerprint </v>

3719
02:56:51.311 --> 02:56:54.611
<v Speaker 1>dust on things and trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the fucking blood splattered from </v>

3720
02:56:54.611 --> 02:56:57.290
<v Speaker 1>and what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck happened,</v>

3721
02:56:57.620 --> 02:57:00.200
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to go over some shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people wrote down.</v>

3722
02:57:00.201 --> 02:57:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Don't even know what the hell they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

3723
02:57:02.340 --> 02:57:07.340
<v Speaker 1>Get a bunch of scholars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one episode I want to do next </v>

3724
02:57:07.340 --> 02:57:10.560
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no primary sources is all a </v>

3725
02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:13.300
<v Speaker 1>archeology and he's these guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you'd remember to start </v>

3726
02:57:13.300 --> 02:57:13.300
<v Speaker 1>at guided.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They found the ball deep,</v>

3727
02:57:13.300 --> 02:57:15.990
<v Speaker 1>perfectly preserved for 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago at the ice.</v>

3728
02:57:16.230 --> 02:57:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see what's.</v>

3729
02:57:18.900 --> 02:57:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an awesome story because through </v>

3730
02:57:23.900 --> 02:57:26.771
<v Speaker 1>archaeology you find out so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can find out what this guy was </v>

3731
02:57:26.771 --> 02:57:26.990
<v Speaker 1>eating 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

3732
02:57:26.991 --> 02:57:31.991
<v Speaker 1>what the of this stuff and yet </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately you don't know who the hell </v>

3733
