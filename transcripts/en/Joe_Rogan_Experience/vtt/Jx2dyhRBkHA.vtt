00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.160
Sweet baby jesus,
we're back again.
Somebody had tweeted me,

2
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.890
I'm going to say sweet baby Jesus.
You shouldn't say that.

3
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:14.280
If you don't believe it to that man,
I say,

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.510
fuck you dummy.
Dare you.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.920
How dare you for your own self.
Don't put that down in print.

6
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.890
Asked some people talk.
Some people before he say some shit like that.

7
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.000
I say merry Christmas to motherfucker.
I think I believe in Santa Claus.

8
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.810
Settle the fuck down this episode of the Joe Rogan experience podcast brought to

9
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:40.230
you by stamps.com if you have any sort of a small business,

10
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:42.200

Um,

11
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.390
and you know what a pain in the ass it is to go to the post office,

12
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:46.770
get everything laid out and all that crap.

13
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.050
You can eliminate all that with stamps.com if you've heard this podcast before,

14
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.730
but now you're like,
motherfucker,

15
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.290
do you have to say this the same way every time?
And the answer to that is yes.

16
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.980
Uh,

$55 free postage.

19
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.470
There's a little right hand corner of the upper right hand corner of stamps.com

20
00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:15.690
is a little microphone like old schooling microphone like Lenny Bruce used to

21
00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:20.310
use.
Click on that bitch and it'll ask you if you,
uh,

22
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.370
have a coupon or whatever code and type jre that's you want to type and you'll

23
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:28.560
save some money.
It's an excellent service.

24
00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:32.040
It's what Brian uses to send out all those desk squad tee shirts that he makes.

25
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.790
That's all right.
And by the way,
there's a new one that's on the way.

26
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.510
This is my favorite.
The new one is my name.
It's cool.
It's,
it's dope.

27
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.520
It's very trippy.
A death squad.
Dot TV.
So all those a t shirts,

28
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.140
that's all Brian's creation.
He makes those all himself.
So,
um,

29
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.010
if you,
uh,
are interested in them,
they're on up.

30
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.700
There's a presale form right now.
Yeah,
just go shop squad.tv.

31
00:01:56.701 --> 00:02:00.720
Actually all these will be sent out with stamps.com and he's been using

32
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:02.430
stamps.com for a long time.

33
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.640
<v 1>It's a great service for you,
right?
Yeah,
it's great.</v>

34
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.080
There's no way that I would do this by taking all these packages to the post

35
00:02:09.081 --> 00:02:13.640
office and just trying to sit there and have this old lady way every single one

36
00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:16.260
of them and do you know,
and then we're going to be old lady.

37
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:20.000
It could be a dude with a gun.
True.
I mean what young kids are like,
Hey,

38
00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:22.490
I'm going to get a job at the post office.
Who does that?
No one does that

39
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.060
<v 0>blend.
It's a post office.
A good job,
man.
That's the,
any,</v>

40
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.150
any sort of government job like that.
There's,
there's a lot of benefits to it.

41
00:02:28.151 --> 00:02:31.450
It's tough to get fired.
It's on the way out there.
Right.
Um,
you know,

42
00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:32.230
when I think,

43
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.990
I think that we're going to have three d printers and we're going to be able to

44
00:02:34.991 --> 00:02:35.950
make things in our homes.

45
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.080
I think they're going to be shipping raw materials to us.

46
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.400
That's what I think is going to happen.

47
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.200
I think we're going to have like raw materials in our house.

48
00:02:41.201 --> 00:02:45.270
Then we're going to download the instructions or the code or whatever the,
the,

49
00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:48.880
the bin file that's going to lead to like a computer and you're going to print

50
00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:50.740
up a computer in your house.
That's what I think.

51
00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:53.020
I think they're going to have the new code.
You're going to get the new code.

52
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.250
I mean eventually.

53
00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:56.680
What would be amazing if they could ever figure this out and I know they've

54
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.040
considered this is recycling your computer,
taking

55
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.030
<v 2>the raw minerals out of and reprocessing it and using it to make a new computer</v>

56
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:07.990
like that.
They're going to get to a point where they can extract minerals from,

57
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.220
from used up electronics and like recycled them.
Absolutely.
Completely.

58
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.550
Like everyone at home,
you know?
That's what I think the future is.

59
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.780
So you'll be using stamps.com to send cold tran right through the,

60
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.150
through the mail.
What that stuff's called cold cold.
Can we started?

61
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.730
I don't know when I'm allowed to talk to is you're allowed to talk anytime.

62
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.960
This is very,
just wait,
I'm sorry.
We'll get through it.

63
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.780
<v 1>Fedex though than like ups are ever going to take over the mail,</v>

64
00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:39.290
the US mail or like a company that you send your mail to that will then filter

65
00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:42.740
all that bullshit and then it's sent to you like one letter every two weeks that

66
00:03:42.741 --> 00:03:43.574
you really need.

67
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.600
<v 2>Hmm.
I Dunno man.</v>

68
00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:48.200
I mean you wouldn't want anybody filter in your shit because what one person

69
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.071
would,
you know,

70
00:03:49.071 --> 00:03:52.310
if someone can like arbitrarily decide what kind of mail you shouldn't,

71
00:03:52.311 --> 00:03:53.144
shouldn't get,

72
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.390
then they get like boycott companies from sending you like legitimate mail.

73
00:03:56.391 --> 00:03:58.340
Like there could be like problems with that.

74
00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:59.960
I don't think that would be suggested.

75
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.690
I think that the model that is uses ups though.
Really?
Yeah.

76
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.030
Oh I didn't know that.
Yeah.

77
00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.310
To ship things like they make deals like go rent space.
That makes sense.
Yeah.

78
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.270
But um,
anyway,
easiest way to do it.
stamps.com use the code word,
j.

79
00:04:14.271 --> 00:04:18.470
R.
E.
N.
D.
A.
You get this $110 offer.
It's pretty sweet.

80
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.220
We're also brought to you by legal zoom.com and legal zoom is a website that is

81
00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:26.660
essentially set up to do a lot of legal shit for you that you would normally

82
00:04:26.661 --> 00:04:29.450
have to go to a lawyer and pay a lot of money for.

83
00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.430
They can sort of guide you through,
uh,
things like incorporating,

84
00:04:34.431 --> 00:04:38.390
forming an LLC.
I'm writing a legal will.

85
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.130
They can do all that shit online where you don't have to go to a lawyer and

86
00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:46.280
spend an ass load of cash and if you get in over your head,

87
00:04:46.281 --> 00:04:50.090
they'll actually connect you with an independent attorney.
So if you're like,

88
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.410
I don't feel comfortable with us anymore than you can get connected with an

89
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.050
independent attorney and uh,
they'll,

90
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.130
if you need any additional guidance and if you check out legal zoom.com and see

91
00:05:01.131 --> 00:05:03.440
how they can help you out,
it's not a law firm.

92
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.510
They provide self help services at your specific direction.

93
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.620
It's kind of an interesting setup.
Um,

94
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.630
use the codeword Rogan in the referral box and you can save yourself some money

95
00:05:14.631 --> 00:05:18.290
on that as well.
In the past 12 years,
like 2 million people have used legal zoom.

96
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.710
Then you use it.
I used it.
How easy is it?
To be honest,

97
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.490
<v 1>it's so easy.
It's almost too easy.
Really like tricky.
Do you get no,</v>

98
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.440
I mean I unfortunately I didn't use all the information available@legalzoom.com

99
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:36.670
to figure out how what I was getting myself into.
You didn't,

100
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.560
you asked that was drunk and I was just like how I hired a guy hired,

101
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:43.900
I mean I got a girl off the internet to come to me.

102
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:46.600
I didn't even remember doing it the next day and then I was like,
wow,

103
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:50.130
that was easy.
Yeah,
I'm a corporation now.
Wow,

104
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.980
so you became a corporation while drunk.
Yeah.
That's pretty sweet.

105
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.080
That's legendary.
That's legend Shit.

106
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.560
And it's done through legal zoom and looking.
I wouldn't recommend that.
No,

107
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.100
that's not a story.
Like this is the,
this is how I approach,

108
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.420
this is how I approach operated.
So you could hire the girl.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

109
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.680
<v 2>Contact with this person from legal zoom and they,</v>

110
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.620
<v 1>oh no,
no.
What I was comparing it to is how easy it was.
Like when I,</v>

111
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.100
this other thing I did when I was drunk where I had flown somebody out that I

112
00:06:17.101 --> 00:06:19.980
barely knew from a different country to stay with me for seven days.

113
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.310
A couple of weeks ago.
It was just like that where the next morning I did didn't,

114
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.130
I woke up and I was like,
holy cow,
I did all of this.
Wow.

115
00:06:26.131 --> 00:06:29.510
That was easy I guess and it it,
you know what's though they send,

116
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.910
they send you this really nice like book and you have like a stamp with your

117
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.710
corporation name on it.

118
00:06:34.711 --> 00:06:37.380
You know for I guess doing paperwork which you're supposed to do when we have a

119
00:06:37.381 --> 00:06:38.700
corporation and things like that.

120
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.770
You have like all this good stuff that you're supposed to,

121
00:06:40.771 --> 00:06:43.000
I mean it's a really nice package but just,

122
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.800
just be careful with what you do because this is serious shit.
This is not like,

123
00:06:46.801 --> 00:06:47.940
Hey,
I want to do this and that.

124
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.660
Like really use all the information that's available@legalzoom.com to figure out

125
00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:54.600
what you're,
you're,
you're,
you're doing,
because it is a,
you know,

126
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.330
there's some things on there that's,
you know,
adult stuff.
That little shit.
Yeah.

127
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.760
It was like kids like me,
drunk,
blacked out shinning.
I've gotten them themselves.

128
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.410
That is kind of weird that you can do illegal shit online while you're hammered,

129
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.620
but how do you know,
how do you stop that?

130
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.470
<v 2>Can I have like a USB thing that you plug in?</v>

131
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.560
You have to suck on and it gives you a breathalyzer and then it's like,
bitch,

132
00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:18.520
you can't put that online.
You know?

133
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:23.080
It's almost like the idea that you could just go and do some legal shit while

134
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.880
really hammered out of your mind.

135
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.190
That's terrifying and it has ramifications and all kinds of tons of those.
Yeah.

136
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.200
So don't drink and go to legal zoom.com that's sound advice from Brian Red

137
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:35.530
Redman.
You know,

138
00:07:35.531 --> 00:07:39.100
you've got to learn from people's mistakes and Brian's willing to let you get a

139
00:07:39.101 --> 00:07:42.250
little peek in his life.
Your Guinea pig.
Yeah.
There you go,
folks.

140
00:07:42.251 --> 00:07:47.170
He did that for you.
He's like,
Jesus,
he suffered for you.
The son of Mary.
Yeah,

141
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.550
sorry.
As legal zoom.com.
So a go and go fuck yourself.

142
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.160
I also brought to you by audit.com.
That's o,
n n I t.

143
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.140
We have the new gorilla kettle bell that's coming out any day now.
Um,

144
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.440
if you go to,
uh,
on it.com,

145
00:08:05.441 --> 00:08:10.020
this is ridiculous.
Ford slash.
APPS.
Ford.
Slash.
Gorilla.
Yeah.

146
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.920
No one could make that an easier.
They have like,
um,
there's a,
a,

147
00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:18.250
a package like you can win a uh,
um,
an on it.
Primal Bell.

148
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.390
I don't know how you win,
but you can enter and a,
I guess we'll give him one.

149
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.090
It's their,
it's their super bad ass look and these gorilla ones,

150
00:08:25.091 --> 00:08:29.440
I can't wait until they come out.
It's a 72 pound one and it looks like,

151
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.330
can you see it?
There is angry face gorilla,
right?
Yeah.
Send my Twitter somewhere.

152
00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.070
But uh,
that's the,
the second in the line of primal bells.

153
00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:44.071
Their kettlebells design like evil fucking primates as a chimpanzee and a

154
00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:48.760
gorilla and the gorilla one is so bad ass cause the chimpanzee,

155
00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:52.060
I always think of the chimpanzee has the face that a chimp makes when it's

156
00:08:52.061 --> 00:08:56.250
biting your Dick off.
That's this.
But this,
this gorilla,

157
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.580
this is the face that a gorilla makes when it's hovering over you and it's about

158
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:03.630
to take your soul.
That's what it looks like.
The gorilla is amazing.

159
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:08.100
The guy who did the artwork for the grill,
it's so bad ass.
And I seriously,

160
00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:11.490
I look at these things that I could work out with a chimpanzee when I actually

161
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:16.220
imagine a chimp trying to kill me and it gives him like an extra rush work

162
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:20.700
workout thing about gorillas and chimpanzees.
Every you go,
it's like,

163
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.590
you know,
we were going to go find the man size chimps.
Fuck that dude.

164
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:29.190
Good luck with all that thing I'm going to think about could good luck.

165
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.120
I would never go near those fun things.
They're just so gangster there.

166
00:09:33.121 --> 00:09:37.650
They're smart and they're strong.
It's fuck.
And if they decide to go after you,

167
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:41.340
you gotta like you gotta real problem.
You can't fight off at chimp.

168
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.070
They're smart.
They like bite your fingers off first or voted by Boone.

169
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.590
I wouldn't fight those either.
You don't want a Fang?
Yeah,
I just think,

170
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.790
I think we are so ridiculously week the human animal,

171
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:58.350
like even the strongest amongst us,
the most bad ass football player of all time.

172
00:09:58.351 --> 00:10:01.710
It's so incredibly weak compared to a real prime.

173
00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:06.150
It would win between Ray Lewis in the baboons about Boone.

174
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.240
Maybe Ray Lewis could like hurt it real bad,

175
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.490
break a leg slamming on the ground or something.

176
00:10:11.491 --> 00:10:14.730
But what if he gets bitten a neck?
You know,

177
00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:18.780
if it just locks on his neck and puts his legs around his fucking shoulders and

178
00:10:18.781 --> 00:10:23.100
start sucking his blood.
Woo.
I don't know,
man.
I don't know.
Right.

179
00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:27.510
I don't know how you'd fare there.
Uh,
I,
I think humans are just weak as fuck.

180
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.110
I think even when you see a guy like ray Lewis who's unbelievably strong for a

181
00:10:31.111 --> 00:10:35.580
person like bitch,
between the a person like my size and a person his size,

182
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.820
he's not even the same human like he can do things to people.

183
00:10:38.821 --> 00:10:43.821
You've seen that guy ragdoll giant men just whacked all them with ferocity.

184
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.650
A chimp would eat his ass.
It would hold him down and eat his ass.

185
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.840
It would be no way to stop it.
If a gorilla decided to fuck him,

186
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.300
it would fuck him until he starved to death.

187
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.320
It would just hold him by the neck and just girls have a little tiny dicks.

188
00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.230
They only have like one inch Dick.
I did not know.
They're small.

189
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.390
They don't have to have big dicks because they dominate.

190
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.950
They doesn't matter to them.

191
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.160
It feels good no matter what size it is and the smaller ones don't get bitten is

192
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:09.090
easy.
Isn't the,

193
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:14.120
isn't the gorilla the one where the Alpha gorilla gets to have sex with all the

194
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.940
yes.
Email and everybody else is trying to kill him all.
Yes,

195
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:19.890
so that they can screw them.
Yeah.
Their,

196
00:11:19.891 --> 00:11:24.000
their appearance is entirely for protecting themselves against other gorillas.

197
00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.780
And I guess other,
you know,
other like predators,

198
00:11:27.781 --> 00:11:30.840
but like they have these giant fangs but they eat grass.

199
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:35.670
They like Broccoli and Shit,
you know,
and they have these like a huge arm,

200
00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.910
all the ridiculously strong.
I'd like.

201
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.190
There are hundreds and hundreds of pounds of fury.

202
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.110
Why do they freak you out so much?
Because he,

203
00:11:43.111 --> 00:11:46.800
I don't think we can even imagine the horsepower that something like that could

204
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:50.640
generate if it was coming after you.
I think,
uh,
I think it's,

205
00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.680
if it didn't exist.
Okay.

206
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.930
I think the problem with chimps and gorillas is that exists and that they've

207
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:58.480
always existed.
So we look at them and go,
Oh yep,

208
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.920
there's a champ that's a gorilla if that,
if you didn't know that was real.
Okay.

209
00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:08.070
And there was this black hairy thing that's sort of like a person but not really

210
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:14.670
and is obviously aware that it's locked in a cage and it's fucking,

211
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:21.210
it's like 600 pounds of muscle and it's looking at you and if it got a hold of

212
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:27.250
you here,
are you a part of like tissue paper?
He couldn't do anything.

213
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.390
You have no options.
You have zero options.
What would you play?
Dead.

214
00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:34.390
Would you let it kill you?
Let it kill you.
What'd you run?

215
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.920
You can try to come up with a stick or a rock that you throw into its eye or

216
00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:40.240
something.
If you get really lucky,

217
00:12:40.241 --> 00:12:44.260
you could hurt it and scare it off enough so you can run away if you get really

218
00:12:44.261 --> 00:12:47.960
lucky.
But if you don't,
if you throw that rocket,

219
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:52.950
it hits him and bounces off like it's been at a styrofoam but like the uh,

220
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:53.601
a bear.

221
00:12:53.601 --> 00:12:57.330
You're supposed to play dead or you know the shark is with the punches and know

222
00:12:58.130 --> 00:12:59.330
what are you supposed to do with a gorilla?

223
00:12:59.331 --> 00:13:02.970
What's the I suppose to stand your ground?
The stand your ground?
Yeah.

224
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.790
I don't think you're supposed to make eye contact,

225
00:13:04.791 --> 00:13:07.790
but you're supposed to stand your ground so that when they make a bluff charge,

226
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:11.900
which they always do,
you can't respond.
Right.
If you respond,
if you back up,

227
00:13:11.901 --> 00:13:15.440
you are fucked.
He just keeps coming up.
They'll just smash you.
If you,

228
00:13:15.441 --> 00:13:17.740
if the respond,
they'll smash you,
but they,

229
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:21.950
if they run up to you and you can handle it,
apparently they don't want to fight.

230
00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.380
They just want you to get the fuck away from them.
Right,
right,
right.

231
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.630
Like most of the time,
guerrillas aren't looking to fight people.

232
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.570
They're just like,
bitch,
you better get the fuck away from here.
Right.

233
00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.630
And then they'll charge up to you.
We'll look,
bitch,
I'm not fucking serious.

234
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:34.460
And then you,
what do you do?
You've gotta just,

235
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:38.480
you gotta just get the fuck out of there.
Nice and slow and,
but don't,
don't run.

236
00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.410
Don't run and stand your ground.
It's a terrifying prospect.

237
00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:45.620
If it happens next time in Africa,
and I'm going to go,

238
00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:50.310
I hope Rogan is right because,
yeah,
I hope I'm right too.
I like standing there.

239
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.160
He's still coming.
He's still coming,
Joe.
The grill is like,
why do you,

240
00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:57.610
why did you do I really want to run on big chewy scared of me.

241
00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.180
Yeah.
Um,
there's,
they just fucking,
they freaked me out.
Primates,

242
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:04.520
primates freak me out.
They all freaked me out.

243
00:14:04.521 --> 00:14:08.240
A monkey killed a dude in India last year because I met like a mayor or some

244
00:14:08.241 --> 00:14:11.390
town and a monkey killed him.
A bunch of monkeys.
They jumped him.

245
00:14:11.391 --> 00:14:15.130
Fuck this dude up.
Monk is good people,
man.
Sure.

246
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.500
Fucking terrifying.
Anyway,
on it.com oh and,

247
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.970
and I t check out the new gorilla,
a kettle bell,

248
00:14:22.971 --> 00:14:26.730
which comes out very soon and we've got all kinds of other shit too.
Of course.

249
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:28.730
News report of this lady that,
uh,

250
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.600
and this is just going on around the Internet of what to do if a bear comes.

251
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.730
Oh No.
The funniest shit ever.
Listen to this.

252
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.760
Okay.
Her face.
What is she
don't run away.
Oh,

253
00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:44.700
she's acting like don't make eye contact.

254
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.620
Oh God.
Hold on.
We'll curl up into a ball.

255
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.580
She threw a shoe at it.
Yeah.
They said she was not going to worrying flat.

256
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.790
I wouldn't throw my,
I think you shouldn't lay flat,

257
00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:04.730
would you have to curl up in a fetal position and put your hands over the back

258
00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:05.240
of your head?

259
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.540
What you really got to worry about as I'm Severin arteries than biting into your

260
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:12.050
neck.
You've got to put your hands over the back of your neck.
But good luck,

261
00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:14.510
bitch.
That's a 900 pound dog,

262
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:19.370
900 hundred wild dog that kills Moose.
We had a big face attack.

263
00:15:19.371 --> 00:15:24.170
One of our crews once it was in Alaska in the High Mo,
uh,
refugees.

264
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.280
Oh,
I'd love that story.
Hold on.
Let's kill the music man.
Let's begin.

265
00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:30.560
The official podcast is,
that's one of my favorite stories.

266
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.860
<v 4>Rogan experience.</v>

267
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:40.500
Joe Rogan podcast all day.

268
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:49.760
<v 2>That special that you guys did,
the Arctic Adventure Heimos Arctic adventure.</v>

269
00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:51.960
Yeah.
That was the first thing that I found.

270
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.690
That's how I found out about you guys.
Oh,
I watched that.

271
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:59.250
I watched it twice in a row because it was so fascinating.
First of all,

272
00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:01.860
that there's this guy who was not a dumb guy.
No,

273
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.980
he was a smart guy and he was very,

274
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.040
like very articulate and really passionate about the way he was living his life

275
00:16:10.321 --> 00:16:14.830
in this really harmonious way.
Hunting and gathering middle.
Yeah.

276
00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:19.740
With a log shack and his wife and I believe at the time he was the most romantic

277
00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.430
remote person on earth.
That's why we did it.
It's incredible.
It's a,

278
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.720
it was such a fascinating thing.
This guy hadn't ever seen the towers fall.
Yeah.

279
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.070
I mean the most iconic shit and the,
the history of this country.

280
00:16:32.071 --> 00:16:35.070
And he had never seen that.
He had just heard of it.
Yeah.
I mean,

281
00:16:35.071 --> 00:16:40.071
he was so remote and so self reliant and it utterly fascinating.

282
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.420
Really fascinating.
Uh,
so,
and the been so heartbreaking to,

283
00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:48.220
and who's talking about losing his child?
The,
the,

284
00:16:48.221 --> 00:16:52.500
the canoe tipped over and they lost their baby.
I mean,
dude,
it was,

285
00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:56.400
oh my God,
it was so,
so heartbreaking.

286
00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.270
But what's so fascinating is really,
it's like into the wild.

287
00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:04.140
If the guy was an idiot.
Yes.
If the guy actually knew what he was doing,

288
00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.500
I think that into the wild guy.
I mean,
I,

289
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:10.530
I need to really look at the story better because all I know is the movie.

290
00:17:10.531 --> 00:17:14.220
I saw the movie and I believe that the movie doesn't represent the truth.

291
00:17:14.221 --> 00:17:18.000
For whatever reason,
they decided to make it out that he'd eaten some poison.

292
00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.830
Right.
But it wasn't really poison.
He just starved to death.
Right.

293
00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:24.120
You didn't know what he was doing.
Yeah.
Well,
I think that's a shitty thing to do.

294
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.780
Yeah.
I think that's a shitty thing to do to make a movie and put this artificial

295
00:17:27.781 --> 00:17:31.050
ending to a semi historical event.
I mean,
he's,

296
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.330
he's like a sort of a poetic figure.

297
00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:37.530
This guy who just goes off into the woods and yeah.
You know,

298
00:17:37.531 --> 00:17:41.340
becomes this,
you should know maybe a bit more about it.
I mean,

299
00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:45.870
how about something about it?
He didn't know anything they were high,
was like,

300
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:50.100
he can just live in the middle of nowhere.
Yeah.
And,
and just

301
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.250
<v 0>live never gets warm.
First of all,
he doesn't need,</v>

302
00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.570
he doesn't need a refrigerator.

303
00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:00.030
He's hanging this Caribou on the sticks outside of his house when the scene is

304
00:18:00.031 --> 00:18:05.031
so crazy because this dude has always food hanging from frozen slabs on these

305
00:18:06.931 --> 00:18:10.020
trees and then bears come around and he has to kill the bear.

306
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.690
I mean it is fucking bananas.

307
00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.550
<v 5>Just thinking about that is the bear was tracking the team.</v>

308
00:18:16.551 --> 00:18:19.870
So they left to go shooting and went off and the bear was tracking them.

309
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:25.180
It was hunting them and so everyone was,
was aware of it.
And then jaimal goes,

310
00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.680
oh yeah,
by the way,
we're being tracked.
Like he was totally new it.

311
00:18:29.681 --> 00:18:32.560
He understood it.
He goes,
and if,
if the bear comes in,
comes tonight,

312
00:18:32.561 --> 00:18:33.910
it's going to come tonight.
And if it does,

313
00:18:33.911 --> 00:18:38.350
then we're gonna have to shoot it because otherwise it's going to get us cheese.

314
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.110
So sadly they had the shooter.

315
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:45.440
<v 0>Sadly my ass,
that's I'm fucking giant monster.
Once you eat people,</v>

316
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:48.950
I fucking get crazy when people go,
you know what's really fucked up?

317
00:18:48.951 --> 00:18:50.860
Those people shouldn't have been there in the first place.
Sure.

318
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:55.280
But they were okay,
but they were a team people.
Okay.
But they were,

319
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.800
the guy had of course they had to shoot that fucking bear.

320
00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:01.280
What are you just going to move?
You're going to move now?

321
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:01.900
<v 5>Well I mean,</v>

322
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.780
and he lives there and it was actually tracking him because I guess you know,

323
00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:10.060
got some of the meat from before.
But uh,
yeah,
we,
they,
they brought it back.

324
00:19:10.061 --> 00:19:12.490
It's in our office.
The head,
no,
the,

325
00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:16.750
<v 0>the skin,
the body,
the toxins.
They taxidermy.
Oh yeah.
They have to,</v>

326
00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:20.620
when you shoot one,
don't you have to process the skull in some way?

327
00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.580
Don't you have to like send it to uh,
the uh,
fishing game?

328
00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:29.860
No idea.
I think that was like one of the things that was said was that it's a,

329
00:19:29.861 --> 00:19:33.400
when you,
when you shoot a bear,
and I should get my shit straight on this,

330
00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.190
but I think there's something along those lines.

331
00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:37.750
Could be shaving herself defense.
You have to send the skull somewhere.

332
00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.450
Thought Hi.
Moe had a deal that deal with that wasn't there one of,

333
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.170
wasn't that part of it.
Right.
Maybe I'm confusing my bear things.

334
00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:46.290
I've always been fascinated by barriers.

335
00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:48.880
<v 5>No,
I don't know if you saw it,
but we went to another,</v>

336
00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.670
now the most promote person on earth is this,
uh,

337
00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.220
I don't know if you heard what they live in Siberia and the mountains and they

338
00:19:54.221 --> 00:19:59.221
were like a Russian Orthodox during the revolution and they took off during the

339
00:19:59.351 --> 00:20:02.920
revolution and they're still there.
Well,
there's one now.
She's like 85.

340
00:20:02.921 --> 00:20:04.860
She was the youngest and uh,

341
00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:09.550
she lives there in the middle of nowhere on this mountain in like this crazy

342
00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.880
sawed place with light and they didn't have shoes.
I'm like,
how do you,

343
00:20:12.881 --> 00:20:14.680
how do you,
how do your feet not freeze?

344
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:18.940
<v 0>That's incredible.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
They don't have shoes.
Yeah.
How cold is it?</v>

345
00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:23.770
Fucking go home and no shirts.
Yeah,
no frostbite.
I got it.

346
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:24.250
I

347
00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:27.520
<v 5>got to watch it again.
But it was,
they were,
it was going on about no shoes.</v>

348
00:20:27.521 --> 00:20:28.990
Now they have shoes and now they have like,

349
00:20:28.991 --> 00:20:31.450
they wrap their shitting furs and stuff,
but when they first went there,

350
00:20:31.451 --> 00:20:33.460
they didn't have shoes.
And you're like,
how could you not have shoes?

351
00:20:33.461 --> 00:20:35.860
They must have wrapped it in something or maybe they stayed in during the
winter.

352
00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.640
It's so fucking crazy.
Barefoot in Siberia.
Yeah,
you can Google it.
It's,

353
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.130
it's a totally insane story.

354
00:20:42.131 --> 00:20:45.970
That was like five of them living on this mountain in the middle of nowhere with

355
00:20:45.971 --> 00:20:48.850
nothing.
They had nothing had zero.
That's his thing too.
They're like,

356
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.720
they're almost like,
like just super evolved monkeys.

357
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.950
Yeah.
You know,
they're like,
well,
it's interesting because I was like,

358
00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:01.300
if you actually take away everything,
like there's no matches.
Like,
you know,

359
00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:03.820
you maybe you had matches the first five years of the first year,

360
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:07.270
the first five ABMers but like 80 years later there's no,

361
00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:10.660
they don't have matches.
You don't have,
you know,
glass,
you don't have,

362
00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:14.050
you don't have anything.
So to go back to really primal,

363
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:18.580
like we have nothing shit,
but you know that there's another world out there.

364
00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:21.910
It's not like,
oh,
I don't know anything.
Like they,
when they went,

365
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:26.550
it was like the twenties or thirties so they had like cars and shit while owns.

366
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:32.580
Wow.
So how did they get by?
What would the,
how are they cooking their food?
Well,

367
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:33.280
the first,

368
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:36.700
it was like the first decade they were just eating like roots and they were

369
00:21:36.701 --> 00:21:39.010
starving in the winter and they couldn't get buried.

370
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:43.900
And then by the end they were like 65 and just running through the forest,

371
00:21:43.901 --> 00:21:48.700
like catching animals by hand and stuff.
And you're like 65 years old.

372
00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:53.530
I mean they were sort of super cut and tough,
but they got an animal's by hand.

373
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.580
Yeah,
well they had snares and they'd run them into like traps and stuff.

374
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.030
But uh,
but then the,
they were really religious,

375
00:22:01.031 --> 00:22:03.490
but then there was some weird sex shit that was going down.

376
00:22:03.491 --> 00:22:05.080
I forget horse going on down there,

377
00:22:05.081 --> 00:22:07.990
but if you leave a bunch of people by themselves that's fucking each other in

378
00:22:07.991 --> 00:22:10.480
very weird ways.
Once they realized no one's looking,

379
00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:13.870
once he realized that there's no one else but them,

380
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:17.470
how many people were that were up there?
It wasn't a lot.
It was like,

381
00:22:17.471 --> 00:22:21.850
it was a family and they had like two or three girls,
I believe.

382
00:22:21.851 --> 00:22:26.090
And then there was the parents and then like uncle Peter wanted to lie with Jean

383
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:30.150
Chesca or whatever and Oh my God,
you know Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

384
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.310
If you only have a small group like that,
it's going to be a mass.
It gets,

385
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:37.600
it gets,
it gets lord of the flies quick.
Yeah.
What is it about humans?

386
00:22:37.601 --> 00:22:40.990
It's so disappointing.
Like consistently pretty interesting.

387
00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:46.290
If you strip away like cops and artifice and modernity and technology,

388
00:22:46.451 --> 00:22:51.010
we just go eat quickly very quickly.
We go ape shit really quickly here.

389
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.020
Yeah.
I don't know.
I just,

390
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.890
as I get older,

391
00:22:56.891 --> 00:23:01.180
especially the broad spectrum of our ability,

392
00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.260
whether it's to be just utter complete cunt,
merciless,
killer,

393
00:23:05.261 --> 00:23:10.120
Gingiss con style,
it's like super nice philanthropists person.

394
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.250
Like the broad spectrum of what people are capable of it.

395
00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.720
It hurts your brain cause it's,
there's,

396
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.520
there's so much conflict going on and there's so much weirdness and the,

397
00:23:21.521 --> 00:23:26.070
the potentials for human behavior and what it's all based on,
like the,

398
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.710
the principles of thinking and the,
the,
the,
the,
the,

399
00:23:28.711 --> 00:23:32.020
the feeling of comradery you're supposed to have with your community and

400
00:23:32.021 --> 00:23:35.500
extending that to people that you haven't met before and don't disregard them

401
00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:40.501
because the numbers are so high that you're overwhelmed with people that you say

402
00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:45.350
you lose a sense of community.
I was reading this book,
uh,
and I,

403
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:46.010
and I saw

404
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.780
<v 2>words I didn't know.
So I googled it and they were like,</v>

405
00:23:47.781 --> 00:23:51.650
it's this empire just before the Byzantine Empire.
And uh,

406
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:55.070
and then I just sort of went down the Wikipedia page and they're like,

407
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.340
and it's this empire and then this emperor kill December.

408
00:23:58.341 --> 00:24:01.880
And then took his wife and then they married somebody else in another empire to

409
00:24:01.881 --> 00:24:04.910
save it.
But then they ended up,
you know,
going and your reading going,

410
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.970
this is fucking game of Thrones.
Like they were just,

411
00:24:07.971 --> 00:24:11.570
they were just kingdoms all fully killing each other,
trying to marry.

412
00:24:11.571 --> 00:24:14.440
And then they would have a kid and then the kid would come up and slaughtered

413
00:24:14.441 --> 00:24:18.480
the person who slaughtered his dad.
And it was just like,
but,
and,
and the,

414
00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.300
the way that they killed them,
the way that they deal.

415
00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.820
So it's fascinating because you're like,
oh,
that's human history.

416
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:26.000
We just went after each other like continually,
you know,

417
00:24:26.001 --> 00:24:30.470
for thousands of years until we decided let's does a weird thing that we have

418
00:24:30.471 --> 00:24:34.620
with like extreme levels of competition too.
You know,

419
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.390
I was watching,
um,
some rugby the other day.

420
00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:41.450
I had never seen rugby before.
I mean,
I've seen it.
I've seen like,
you know,

421
00:24:41.451 --> 00:24:43.040
a guy has a ball and he's got running.

422
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.160
I didn't know what the fucking rules where I had no idea

423
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.240
fueled TV the other day and it never seen it before.

424
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:54.360
And all of a sudden I'm watching this savage fucking game,
like the best.

425
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.950
I love it.
So first of all,
it's so aggressive.
They don't rest.

426
00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:02.660
Like in football there's all this resting going on rugby,

427
00:25:02.661 --> 00:25:06.890
there's no continued.
Like that ball goes down,
then something's happening.

428
00:25:06.891 --> 00:25:09.050
I don't understand the rules.
I don't know what the fuck's going on,

429
00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:13.250
but I just know some dudes are colliding into some dudes and their restaurant

430
00:25:13.251 --> 00:25:15.830
over shit and it gets pretty fucking savage.

431
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.690
The only sport I think that's heavier.

432
00:25:17.691 --> 00:25:20.510
Well there's two is a Australian rules football.

433
00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:26.480
Fuck the fuck out of me.
Literally kick each other like they'll just yet.

434
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:30.440
Uh,
and then uh,
what the garlic,

435
00:25:30.441 --> 00:25:34.440
like a hurling like gala.
Yes.
When they have sticks and they watch shit.

436
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.660
I didn't even know about that shit until dom Irrera school beyond that stuff is

437
00:25:38.661 --> 00:25:43.290
crazy with that,
that ax handle that they're carrying around a whipping it shit.

438
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.700
What a fucking nutty game man.

439
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:52.090
We have this need for that extreme release and I think that's what what sports

440
00:25:52.521 --> 00:25:55.590
are trying to do with things like,
you know,
mimics battle,

441
00:25:55.591 --> 00:26:00.591
mimic more does it mimics bowel mimics war n it alleviates the need to engage in

442
00:26:01.491 --> 00:26:02.420
those activities.

443
00:26:02.421 --> 00:26:06.800
You can vicariously engage in explosive athletic,

444
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:10.070
aggressive activities without getting your body destroyed,

445
00:26:10.071 --> 00:26:11.390
without having to go to war,

446
00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:15.050
without having to harm people around you and be in a constant state of war.

447
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:19.580
It's almost like we figured out a way to sort of calm the monkey down a little

448
00:26:19.581 --> 00:26:22.610
bit.
Give the little monkeys fake violence.
What's the quote?

449
00:26:22.611 --> 00:26:27.110
Business is the modern form of art.
Modern Art Barn.
Formal warfare.

450
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:30.470
That's,
it's just like going after each other.

451
00:26:30.471 --> 00:26:34.220
Like we're going to get them put coke,
Pepsi now you know,
and you're,
you know,

452
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:37.060
all these generals getting their troops lined up.
Sports.

453
00:26:37.061 --> 00:26:40.040
I like the training wheels of enlightenment really.

454
00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:45.120
Cause they're allowing people to go through the need for war and conquest

455
00:26:45.121 --> 00:26:49.590
without actually going to cross crossed the line.

456
00:26:49.591 --> 00:26:50.790
We still go to war.
The word,

457
00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:55.140
the really weird conflict that comes out of sports is when sports fans fight

458
00:26:55.141 --> 00:26:59.110
because they like opposite teams and you're like Jesus Christ boy,
he's really,

459
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.300
you're fighting.
Cause this guy likes the red team.
Woody,
are you in a year?

460
00:27:02.301 --> 00:27:05.650
And the crap shoot and the bloods,
football hooligans.
Oh my God.

461
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.560
Do you ever want to read an amazing book?

462
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:12.180
It's called among the thugs and it's this literary editor who goes and lives

463
00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.770
among the Manchester United.
Oh my God.

464
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:20.840
Paul from and they go around and just beat the crap and they have like just

465
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.480
crazy,
like crazy fighting techniques and stuff and uh,
they,
you know,

466
00:27:25.481 --> 00:27:28.690
then they'll go like,
oh,
we fly into you Ventas,
you know,

467
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.950
and there's 85,000 Italian fans.
Oh my God,

468
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:36.390
5,000 of us.
And we're like,
okay,
that's cool.
That's having,
and you're like,

469
00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.130
you guys are fucking nuts is insane.

470
00:27:39.131 --> 00:27:44.100
5,000 dudes try to took on how they do it all the time.
Yeah.
It's so crazy.

471
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.810
What a bunch of savages.
Yeah,

472
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:50.340
they have that old school savage gene that goes way back to like fucking Henry

473
00:27:50.341 --> 00:27:54.840
the eighth days and they're fighting dragons and Robin hoods and shit.
You know,

474
00:27:54.841 --> 00:27:57.600
like English people have like a different set of genetics.

475
00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:02.010
It's like there's a warrior,
like a history of the war.
They like our,

476
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:06.540
our genetics are all confused locally.
Like they get over here,
you know,

477
00:28:06.541 --> 00:28:07.920
our genetics,
like start here.

478
00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:11.190
Of course I know this is not how genetics really work as Mike Theory.

479
00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.740
They get here and they're like,
nothing [inaudible] going on here.

480
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:17.340
No one's really attacking us that much.
And like everybody calm the fuck down.

481
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:21.150
But in Ireland and England there's still remembering why they drive in the left

482
00:28:21.151 --> 00:28:21.840
side.

483
00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:24.990
They drive in the left side over there so they could sword you with the right.

484
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.870
That's what it's for.
That's where their strong side it.

485
00:28:28.871 --> 00:28:32.070
So if the guys come and you want to be able to hack at him with a sword,

486
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.110
that's some crazy genetics man.
Yeah.

487
00:28:34.111 --> 00:28:38.790
The English I think learned the best that whoever wins is the last guy standing.

488
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:42.210
So the,
the,
their whole thing is like,
you know,
Italians or French,

489
00:28:42.211 --> 00:28:44.670
whatever sort of say,
yeah,
I've got a few licks and you know what we'll get,

490
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.300
I'm going to go get sewn up and come back and then this guy will just stay,

491
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:51.900
keep staying on the field.
But I'm not leaving.
I'm not getting off of here,

492
00:28:51.901 --> 00:28:55.500
you know?
Yeah.
What a crazy history.
You know when you,

493
00:28:55.501 --> 00:29:00.240
when you go back to like European history and the go back to the revolutionary

494
00:29:00.241 --> 00:29:04.180
war and just think that was only a few hundred years ago.
The,

495
00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.530
the like the British are coming,
the British are coming like the red coats.

496
00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:11.970
That was a few hundred years ago.
That's so recent.

497
00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:15.960
As you get older you realize how recent that is.
Like when I,
yeah,

498
00:29:15.961 --> 00:29:19.410
when I was a child and I would tell,
you know,
someone would talk about like the,

499
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.850
you know,
17 hundreds cause I lived in,

500
00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:24.030
I was in San Francisco in [inaudible] 76 I remember it was a spirit of

501
00:29:24.031 --> 00:29:26.730
70661776200 years.

502
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:31.770
And it seemed to me to be so long ago.
It was so long ago.

503
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.090
But now that,

504
00:29:33.091 --> 00:29:37.800
that is like 40 years ago now I lo I go,

505
00:29:37.801 --> 00:29:42.520
oh that's not that long at all.
Like we've only been here for 200 years.

506
00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.240
<v 0>That's not,
that's a tiny little little blip of time.</v>

507
00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:50.470
It's nothing.
It's,

508
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.760
it's a weird thing when you really start to consider how long people have been

509
00:29:54.761 --> 00:29:58.270
around and then how far we've come.

510
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.990
Like as just as it's cumulative,

511
00:30:01.991 --> 00:30:04.810
like it gets faster and faster and faster without a doubt.
Right.

512
00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:08.230
The amount of people that you meet that are tuned in to what the fuck is going

513
00:30:08.231 --> 00:30:10.390
on,
right.
That jumps every year.

514
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.060
Every year you meet more people that are tuned in.

515
00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.460
Do you know who you talking to?
Someone in the middle of talking to him,

516
00:30:15.461 --> 00:30:20.200
you're like,
oh,
okay,
this conversation is only going to a certain place.

517
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:23.710
You know,
this guy,
there's a roadblock there and you know,
he's telling me how,

518
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.540
you know,
whatever he is Peskov Alien,
a Mormon,
whatever it is,
whatever,

519
00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:32.560
whatever foot strict Republican,
there's a wall that you hit.

520
00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:34.790
The earth is less and less of that I think.
Sure.

521
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:39.110
<v 5>Well I think,
you know,
if you look at,
I would think it about this too,</v>

522
00:30:39.111 --> 00:30:42.590
because if you look at history,
we're sort of like,
yeah,
we had some spears,

523
00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:47.120
you know,
we had some bows and arrows.
Oh it was a sword.
And then were different,

524
00:30:47.121 --> 00:30:50.210
better spears and better bows and arrows and all across bow.

525
00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:52.370
And it sort of went like that for like,
you know,

526
00:30:52.371 --> 00:30:56.190
recorded history and then you hit the 19 hundreds and just goes goodbye.

527
00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:01.230
You know,
claims spaceships,
fucking lasers.
You know,
like a nukes.

528
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.530
Oh yeah,
we can go up a whole continent now.
You,

529
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:06.020
we can blow up the whole world if we want.
You know,
it just went,

530
00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:12.140
in reality there was a lot.
Okay.
Then the first half of the century,

531
00:31:12.141 --> 00:31:13.340
but the last half of the century,

532
00:31:13.341 --> 00:31:17.800
like from let's say the forties on like what the fuck?

533
00:31:17.801 --> 00:31:21.770
Like the whole world changed the whole world.
Every fucking thing.
Oh,

534
00:31:21.771 --> 00:31:25.400
there's the moon.
Let's fly to it.
Yeah.
If I can go boom,
you know,
and,
and uh,

535
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:29.390
you know,
now like going to Mars and you know all this shit and you're like,

536
00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:30.510
what the fuck?
Like

537
00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.260
<v 0>pulse from Mars with a robot.
It's insane.</v>

538
00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.500
They shot a robots for the air,

539
00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.070
landed it on another planet that's all in Dothan.

540
00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.560
I'll just like a million fucking miles away.

541
00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:43.920
<v 5>I just wonder like,</v>

542
00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.110
it's like a million miles or 10 million miles or whatever it is.

543
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.560
What do they have?
Do they have like a Sega Genesis control pad?

544
00:31:49.561 --> 00:31:54.410
Like how do they control that pocket?
But it's 1 million mark.

545
00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:58.330
How can you,
how can you,
how can,

546
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.150
even if it's going by Lightspeed,
which is the fastest shit can go,

547
00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:07.110
it's still got to take like a year to get there for it to move the robot.

548
00:32:07.111 --> 00:32:10.560
How does that work?
Probably using like gps coordinates,
you know,

549
00:32:10.561 --> 00:32:13.740
it's probably not actual video or anything like that.
It's probably using like,

550
00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:18.330
like a GE,
we didn't like satellite or something like radar radar.

551
00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:21.780
Satellite would only work if you're underneath it.

552
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:26.640
The fastest you can do it is lightspeed and lightspeed just to get to Mars would

553
00:32:26.641 --> 00:32:28.580
take like a little closest approach.

554
00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.840
<v 0>Mars is as close as this 34.8 million miles.</v>

555
00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.990
Oh my God.
That makes me scared.

556
00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.990
I get so scared when people talk about like going to Mars.

557
00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.160
I really like legitimately

558
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.060
<v 5>start shitting my pants.
Just thinking what if they sent you out there?</v>

559
00:32:44.061 --> 00:32:48.090
What did they put you on that tube and shot you to Mars?
I saw that.
Uh,

560
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.460
which one finger?
Schwartzenegger.
Oh,
he went to Mars.
No,
no,

561
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:55.430
I saw the sports there.
Was that total recall?
Yeah.
No,

562
00:32:55.431 --> 00:32:58.730
but I'm talking about just being in space in a tube for six months.

563
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.920
No hurling through the galaxy with no safety net.
No.

564
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:05.840
She'd see the Dick pic of on Mars that they took.
They took pictures of Dicks.

565
00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:10.400
Oh yeah.
So the rover drove it,
drove it down.
The one that the planet,

566
00:33:10.401 --> 00:33:15.350
they just found which one?
The one that reigns glass.
Jesus Christ.

567
00:33:15.351 --> 00:33:19.970
450,000 mile an hour winds or something like that.
Something crazy like that,

568
00:33:19.971 --> 00:33:24.960
right?
Yeah.
It rains glass.
That's like almost as bad as the shark shark.

569
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:29.870
Oh,
I can't believe that was a real movie.

570
00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:33.140
You would have to have like diamonds closing sharp NATO.

571
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:35.960
Sounds like it'd be a fun movie if I'm moving to me.
Oh No.

572
00:33:35.961 --> 00:33:40.070
But they made it my ass.
I bet it's fun.
Yeah.
I like stupid moves like that.

573
00:33:40.071 --> 00:33:41.540
I love that.
A Parata movie.

574
00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.860
We've talked about shark NATO a long time ago before you even came out for some

575
00:33:45.861 --> 00:33:48.610
reason.
Did we?
I forgot.
Remember it.
There wasn't no,
he's also,

576
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:52.070
I'd like the octopus that had,
instead of legs,
I had sharks as legs.
Oh yeah.

577
00:33:52.071 --> 00:33:52.904
That's right.

578
00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:01.040
That's so stupid.
And yet awesome.
Um,
so yeah,

579
00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.410
this planet rains glass.

580
00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:07.430
It's 4.8 billion kilometers away,

581
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:11.000
so it's almost three miles.
Three,
3 billion miles away.

582
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:16.550
How reigns class?
That's crazy.
The fuck man.
Jesus.

583
00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:21.110
It's blue.
It's a beautiful blue and it's raining glass.

584
00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:25.560
It's like a spinning gigantic,
like one of those little paper weights.

585
00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:27.980
It was glass paper waste.
It looked bad ass.

586
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:30.830
How easy is it to sneak somebody out of the Philippines?

587
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:33.800
There's enough to do with rain and glass.

588
00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.070
Settle down son.
Right?
Uh,
it's not,

589
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:43.970
it's not hard to seek anyone out anywhere.
You got to get a passport,

590
00:34:43.971 --> 00:34:48.260
which are remarkably easily.
What about visa?
They have to get visas to leave,

591
00:34:48.261 --> 00:34:51.560
so no one's gonna you game.
He can't like download a wife.

592
00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:56.730
I can't do that.
They'll get you what they say.
She,

593
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:59.180
she says,
I have to act like I'm engaged to wear it,

594
00:34:59.181 --> 00:35:01.400
but then they have to go through like you're going to get scammed.

595
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:05.690
I go through emails.
Giant brothers,
they're going to hold you down.

596
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.120
Take your money.
They're going to be say,
he'll be like,

597
00:35:08.121 --> 00:35:10.640
these guys are sleeping at my house.
I'm not really sure what I should do.

598
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:15.700
I'm thinking to call him the cop,
but I don't want the girl to leave.
You're good.

599
00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:20.300
I didn't know.
Was that hard?
Yeah,
it's hard,
man.
So yeah.

600
00:35:20.301 --> 00:35:23.970
Planet rains glass.
Well,
yes,
but uh,

601
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:26.800
we were talking about like the second half of the last century.
Yeah.

602
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:30.620
I get these because I'm a,
I'm a history buff.
I get these texts.

603
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:34.460
It's an amazing thing.
It's an Oxford professor who,
uh,

604
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:39.450
who sort of puts into like a tweet tweets.

605
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:43.290
So I'm now getting the tweets from 1941.
Like,

606
00:35:43.291 --> 00:35:46.980
what's going on in that account?
I don't know.
I gotta take my phone.
Yeah,

607
00:35:46.981 --> 00:35:49.830
tell me what that is.
Awesome.
I got to tell you,

608
00:35:49.831 --> 00:35:53.400
it is awesome because you're sitting there and you're having a weird day.

609
00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:57.600
You're having a hard day.
Let me just see.
I got money from there,

610
00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.260
but you're,
you know,
you're like,
ah,
fuck today sucks or whatever.

611
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:05.750
And then you're like,
oh,
500,000 Russians were captured,
you know,

612
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.350
outside small Lens.
Here we go.

613
00:36:07.351 --> 00:36:11.430
World War tweets from 1941 it's a World War II.

614
00:36:11.431 --> 00:36:16.431
It's called at realtime ww two at real time.

615
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:21.800
Wwt Nazi plans for all of Russia up to year olds because to become a German

616
00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:26.640
fiefdom full of disarmed slaves goring,

617
00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:30.270
we can drop bombs on them in case of riots and you're sitting there going,

618
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.450
these are all like news headlines and shit and you're like,

619
00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:36.450
this was just what you read in the news every day you woke up,

620
00:36:36.451 --> 00:36:40.290
you got your coffee and you're like goring says we can drop bombs on them.

621
00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:43.110
In case of riots were just going to have work pens and people are like,

622
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:46.110
oh yeah and then now I'm going to go to work and do the shit.
But if you,

623
00:36:46.111 --> 00:36:49.470
if you read the tweets it's like what the fuck was going on?

624
00:36:49.471 --> 00:36:50.790
Just like what you were saying,

625
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:56.300
1776 what was going on in 1941 when like people are still alive.

626
00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:01.110
A lot of people are still alive who were there at that time and you sit there

627
00:37:01.111 --> 00:37:02.700
and go,
Holy Shit.
Like,

628
00:37:02.701 --> 00:37:07.560
we were doing some fucked up shit one generation ago,
like fucked up shit.

629
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.220
And uh,
yeah,
yeah.

630
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.650
Hitler and his chief ministers are now in secret meetings to discuss cutting up

631
00:37:16.651 --> 00:37:20.400
the cake of Russia to dominate,
administer and exploited.
They're just like,
yeah,

632
00:37:20.401 --> 00:37:22.770
we'll have Russia now.
We're just going to take it over and fucking,

633
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:27.390
and you're like,
what the fuck?
I was only 1942.
And you're like,

634
00:37:27.391 --> 00:37:29.160
what the fuck were they thinking?
What the,

635
00:37:29.161 --> 00:37:33.720
what humanity was so fucked up or is so fucked up?
Yeah.

636
00:37:33.721 --> 00:37:36.410
I don't think we've changed so much in one generation.
That's the whole thing.

637
00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:38.880
<v 0>I'd say again,</v>

638
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.260
I mean maybe I'm beans like super optimistic about this and I get accused of

639
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:44.210
that all the time and I,

640
00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:49.210
<v 5>well,
being optimistic is go well.
I don't understand people's,
um,
the,</v>

641
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:52.840
the people resist that,
you know,
because like what evidence is there?

642
00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:55.430
I think there's a trend.
I think

643
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:58.670
<v 0>that trend is the trend,
this,</v>

644
00:37:58.671 --> 00:38:03.190
this information trend and this growth trend with human beings.
I think it's a,

645
00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:07.150
it's an honesty trend and it's a,
um,
it's a,
it's,

646
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:11.300
it's a trend where people are realizing that instead of like just seeking out

647
00:38:11.301 --> 00:38:14.360
people and being an asshole and just being a Dickhead,

648
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:19.390
you can be nice and you can also realize that there's some repercussions to a

649
00:38:19.971 --> 00:38:24.110
lot of shit that happens in this world and that you can use your money to

650
00:38:24.111 --> 00:38:27.710
protest and you can talk about things and like this Trayvon Martin thing is a

651
00:38:27.711 --> 00:38:30.440
perfect example of this I think because there's a lot of people that are very

652
00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:34.550
upset with,
with,
with how the verdict went down,
but there's so little violence.

653
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.010
Sure.
Some people are saying,
well

654
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.240
<v 2>there's some,
there's some,</v>

655
00:38:37.241 --> 00:38:39.700
they're pointing at a few things in this guy got hit in that guy got hit and

656
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:43.520
somebody did through some rocks or something.
That's going to happen in small,

657
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.280
in small numbers.
That's going to happen.

658
00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.150
Exactly when you consider the amount of people that are,

659
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.830
that are out there that are upset and how little violence is actually being

660
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.020
actually enacting.
There's,
it's a,
it's a very strange town.

661
00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.960
<v 5>I agree with you.
And I,
I think it's a couple of things.
I think one,</v>

662
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:05.050
if you ever go to really violent like place where they have super violent

663
00:39:05.051 --> 00:39:09.760
reactions to things,
there's not a lot of,
uh,
movement of information.

664
00:39:09.790 --> 00:39:11.070
There's not a lot of like,
you know,

665
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.470
a lot of the most dangerous places of the most illiterate places.

666
00:39:14.471 --> 00:39:17.920
If you go to Afghanistan,
he goes to Somalia,
they don't have literacy,

667
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:21.040
they don't have movement of information.
So it's just word of mouth.

668
00:39:21.041 --> 00:39:23.980
It's like that guy,
you'd have to kill that guy.
He's a wizard.
Yeah.

669
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:28.270
Or he hates you or whatever the hell.
And so I think that now that there's,

670
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:32.590
we're bombarded with so much information at all time and it doesn't matter,

671
00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:36.490
you know,
if it could be on TV,
it could be on your phone,
it could be wherever.

672
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:41.110
And because of that,
it's,
it's actually bred a lot more tolerance.

673
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.450
Cause they're like,
that guy is a wizard.
The wants to kill you.

674
00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:47.350
And they're actually like,
no,
he's not right.
He's just a dude over there and he,

675
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:49.750
you know,
he doesn't have any water or whatever the fuck it is.

676
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:54.280
And I think that that movement of information has led to us being able to

677
00:39:54.281 --> 00:39:58.640
curtail our lunacy to go back to 1941 and say,
just,
you know,

678
00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:02.830
a generation ago,
we were like,
yeah,
everyone's going to kill everybody,
you know?

679
00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.040
And,
and now we would say,
why the fuck would we do that?
That's stupid.

680
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.570
We're not exactly,
hopefully,

681
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.240
<v 2>oh no,
I do think you're right.
I do think you're right.
And I think it's that,</v>

682
00:40:11.241 --> 00:40:15.240
that ability to share information that everybody sort of gets a piece of what it

683
00:40:15.241 --> 00:40:18.490
really is instead of that's the enemy and they're coming,
holy shit.
Yeah.

684
00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.080
<v 5>It'll be up on Twitter now going,
no,
that's bullshit actually.
Yeah.</v>

685
00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:22.500
They don't want to bomb you.
Actually,

686
00:40:22.501 --> 00:40:24.870
the people of Iran don't hate the people of America.

687
00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:28.380
It's one fucking dude who wants to do this fucking bullshit.
And you know,

688
00:40:28.381 --> 00:40:30.100
that's the whole thing that I think that,
you know,

689
00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:34.170
we have to get technology and the easy consumption of technology out to

690
00:40:34.171 --> 00:40:35.004
everybody quickly.

691
00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:38.120
<v 2>I think it's,
it's the most important thing for,</v>

692
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:41.090
for spreading information that's ever existed.
You know?

693
00:40:41.091 --> 00:40:45.260
And sure it's beneficial for everybody,
including the people in power,

694
00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.350
like the idea that it's beneficial for democracy.

695
00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.260
I don't know about for people in power because people in power to do some shady

696
00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.640
fuck yeah,
they do,

697
00:40:52.641 --> 00:40:55.080
but they got to cut that shit out and the only way they're going to have their

698
00:40:55.081 --> 00:40:58.790
only way they're ever going to turn that shit down is if it all gets exposed.

699
00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.050
<v 5>Which is why you know fucking,
you know,
snowed and shit like that.</v>

700
00:41:03.051 --> 00:41:06.740
Like those guys have to keep doing that.
If by the way,
if you work for the CIA,

701
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.560
sorry,

702
00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:12.030
<v 2>sorry,
Cia Keller,
you guys tell us all the stuff.
We want to know it all.</v>

703
00:41:12.031 --> 00:41:14.280
I'm sure he's doing really good work.

704
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:19.200
I'm convinced mostly the CIA does excellent work,
so thank you very much.

705
00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.520
Thank you for your service.

706
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.620
I think that a [inaudible] man,

707
00:41:25.621 --> 00:41:30.090
this is my point is that you can have a government and you can have senators and

708
00:41:30.091 --> 00:41:33.380
congressmen.
You can vote all,
I was a bit do it the right way.
It can be done,

709
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.190
but it isn't

710
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.690
<v 5>being done across the board uniformly.
Even if you don't want to cry conspiracy.</v>

711
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:41.840
Just the way it's structured is absolutely ridiculous.

712
00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:46.010
The way that these people are allowed to contribute it just vast amount of money

713
00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:50.900
to campaigns.
That is insanity.
That's bribery.
I love it though.

714
00:41:50.901 --> 00:41:53.420
I'm like,
look,
I'll tell you one thing.
Seriously.

715
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:57.110
If I can donate 1.5 million to Republicans or Democrats,

716
00:41:57.111 --> 00:41:59.330
I don't give a fuck who it is,
but if I can,

717
00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.210
if I can get the American Ambassadorship,
I'm not even an American,

718
00:42:02.211 --> 00:42:05.510
but if I can get it to England where I live in a castle,

719
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.780
I ride a white horse and put on,
you know,

720
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:12.230
princely robes and I can get that for 1.5 million or Rome,
you know,

721
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:14.880
be the guy in Rome for five years.
That's awesome.
Right?

722
00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.840
Especially if you're like some Donald Trump baller.
Dude,

723
00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.140
I know it's happened to all,
it's not Obama just above.
It's all of them.

724
00:42:21.141 --> 00:42:23.450
Like they all do it,
but I'm just like,
how?

725
00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.270
How amazing is that to be in and just be like,
you know what?

726
00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.000
I want to be the fucking ambassador to Rangoon.
No,

727
00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.380
I want to be the ambassador to India.

728
00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:34.370
I want to be the ambassador to India and get dressed up like fucking,
you know,

729
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:39.830
like a Roger and I'm going to only come and I want tigers and and,

730
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.230
and you know,
like it's a million and a half bucks.
What the fuck?
Sure.

731
00:42:43.231 --> 00:42:46.970
I'll pay a million and a half bucks if I can be the ambassador to China.

732
00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:50.000
Maybe that's a big one.
Maybe we wouldn't get bored after a while man.

733
00:42:50.001 --> 00:42:51.860
First of all,
you get really tired of fun.

734
00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.680
You get really tired of the assassination attempts because they be trying to

735
00:42:54.681 --> 00:42:57.800
kill you every day.
Somewhere like England where it's just like,
you know,

736
00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:00.980
you just start wearing a wig and then you start powdering your face and like

737
00:43:00.981 --> 00:43:04.690
putting like,
you know,
weird,
you know like people 17,
seven no,
no,

738
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:08.390
like seven like dress like little by little you dress more and more like 17th

739
00:43:08.391 --> 00:43:11.330
century dudes,
you know?
And then you're like,
what are you doing?

740
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:16.610
I am the ambassador to England and I just think that'd be awesome just to be

741
00:43:16.611 --> 00:43:18.740
able to say that I think would get,

742
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:23.610
it sounds like something really good on paper.
We'd have to do lots of get,

743
00:43:23.611 --> 00:43:26.720
it'd be like lots of terrible like okay the,
you know,

744
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.530
Ladies Horticultural Club of the Midlands is here for your,
you know,

745
00:43:30.531 --> 00:43:32.870
tea and crumpets and you're like,
I don't want to get out of bed.

746
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:36.501
I don't think it would be,

747
00:43:36.501 --> 00:43:40.700
it would also be like with my luck it would be like we'd be attacked,
you know,

748
00:43:40.701 --> 00:43:42.650
like urgent toi would attack us immediately.

749
00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:47.240
Did a week for her and then I'd be like,
I dunno.

750
00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.620
Fuck guys,
I'm sorry.
I went out last night.
There was a rave.

751
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:55.640
You guys like raving.
I Dunno.
Like it would be terrible.
Yeah.

752
00:43:55.641 --> 00:43:57.430
You don't want any kind of position like that man.

753
00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.900
Stick like doing that magazine about sneakers.

754
00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.130
It's funny that that's what you guys started out.

755
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:07.820
You guys do these like radical documentary pieces about dude's living in the

756
00:44:07.821 --> 00:44:10.610
most remote parts of the world.
And you started out like talking about sneakers.

757
00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.900
Well,
you started out as a fucking taekwondo dude.
I mean,

758
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:17.980
then you became a comedian and then the fucking UFC.
He fucking,

759
00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:23.210
I did the hardest shit first doing taekwondo.
We did the hardest shit first.

760
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:27.740
Skate shoes are hard,
man.
There's only so many types of shoes that are any good.

761
00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:33.410
Oh,
it,
listen,
I gotta tell you like if,
unless you're Bob Dylan,
you know,

762
00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:36.390
going electric and like I have all the focus were like,
fuck you,

763
00:44:36.391 --> 00:44:40.410
you fucking sell out.
Right?
And then like,
they're like,
oh,

764
00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:44.670
we're not them.
Somebody else said,
oh,
this fucking music is way better.
I think.

765
00:44:44.671 --> 00:44:47.250
Unless you're going to reinvent yourself all the time,
then why do it?

766
00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:50.730
I know magazine,
I know that after five years I knew how to do magazine.
Okay,

767
00:44:50.731 --> 00:44:53.910
let's do something else.
And if you don't want to do different,
she's like,

768
00:44:53.911 --> 00:44:58.770
I was thinking about you.
I'm like,
okay,
hold on a second.
He sort of a,
a,
a weird,

769
00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:03.720
uh,
you know,
psycho a sport,
a comedian,

770
00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:07.320
intellectual political duty,
stretching it out

771
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:14.190
and then you go,
oh,
I see.
No,
you're a fucking intellectual.

772
00:45:14.191 --> 00:45:17.610
You Cock sucker.
You know,
that's absolutely not true.
It's totally true.

773
00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.700
Because what do you do you come up with,

774
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.970
will you come up with theories and you come up with

775
00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:29.320
<v 2>philosophies based on my,
in my mind,
I'm sorry.
I'm thinking,
thinking Harvard.</v>

776
00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.430
Yes.
And my mind,
intellect scholar.
I'm thinking of the real,

777
00:45:33.431 --> 00:45:34.690
a really intelligent person.

778
00:45:34.930 --> 00:45:39.070
I'm a curious person who happens to be a comedian and I have a contact with a

779
00:45:39.071 --> 00:45:39.730
lot of people.

780
00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:42.940
I have contact with a lot of people through Twitter contact with a lot of people

781
00:45:42.941 --> 00:45:45.730
through this.
And it's,
for me,
I feel like it's a,

782
00:45:45.731 --> 00:45:49.510
an obligation if there's ideas that you have or if you've read something that's

783
00:45:49.511 --> 00:45:53.340
fascinating or if you want to convey that you have an obligation to,

784
00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:59.050
that's an intellectual.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
It sounds grandiose.
It's,
uh,
it's,

785
00:45:59.051 --> 00:46:01.840
for me it's a,
it's an obligation to,
uh,

786
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:06.760
explore these certain ideas and to teach,
to tell people.

787
00:46:06.761 --> 00:46:07.990
We're not saying it's a bad thing.

788
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.390
What I was trying to say is there's five or six

789
00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:13.800
<v 5>these things in there.
And it's the same thing.
Like when you,
as you grow,</v>

790
00:46:13.801 --> 00:46:14.330
you want to keep,

791
00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:19.140
<v 2>don't,
it's too pretentious word.
Sorry,
I can't accept it.
Uh,</v>

792
00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:24.290
just what it is is we all are human curious human to label us.

793
00:46:24.851 --> 00:46:27.940
Like this is an intellectual,
this is it.
We're all curious humans.

794
00:46:27.941 --> 00:46:31.750
And if you're afraid of gorillas and intellectual,
I didn't know that.

795
00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:33.730
I'm not afraid of intellectuals.

796
00:46:33.731 --> 00:46:35.440
I'm not afraid of calling someone an intellectual,

797
00:46:35.441 --> 00:46:40.170
but I would never allow someone to consider me one.
Okay.

798
00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:45.010
I withdraw the defense.
Thank you for great Ross.
I really appreciate that.

799
00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.810
That's a lot of pressure on me to stoner Douche bag is way easier to carry.

800
00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:52.840
She comes with low expectations.

801
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:56.160
<v 5>Most 50% of what you talk about is,</v>

802
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.730
this is an interesting thing to think about.
What does this mean?

803
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.910
Where does it take us?
Sorry.
Intellectual.

804
00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:07.930
<v 2>How dare you.
Okay.
We you,
you're pretentious definitions.
But um,
the um,</v>

805
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:09.710
I mean the,
the,
the,
the,

806
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:15.150
the world we live in now in now allows so many more bits of information to hit

807
00:47:16.061 --> 00:47:18.670
your mind.
There's so many more things to discuss.
Yeah.

808
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:21.770
It's like if you just paying attention,
you become an intellectual.
Yeah.

809
00:47:21.771 --> 00:47:24.700
It's like if you're really listening to all the,
the,

810
00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:28.240
the information that's coming back and forth between us to understanding what's

811
00:47:28.241 --> 00:47:30.100
going on with the systems,
the rest

812
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.620
<v 0>of the world with our own biological systems,</v>

813
00:47:32.621 --> 00:47:35.890
with what's healthy and what's bad and what's good,
what's wrong,

814
00:47:35.891 --> 00:47:39.310
and what we've been telling you for 20 years,
it turns out to be total bullshit.

815
00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:41.830
All that stuff.
Is that common Addison?
A million mile.

816
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:46.630
Even the dumb people are smarter than the dumb people in the 1940s 100% the

817
00:47:46.631 --> 00:47:50.140
dopiest motherfuckers on this planet would run circles around the dummies in the

818
00:47:50.141 --> 00:47:53.920
1940s so I just think,
I think we're,

819
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:56.530
it's happening too fast for us to truly appreciate it,

820
00:47:56.531 --> 00:48:01.531
but I think we're in the middle of one of the greatest ages of information and

821
00:48:01.661 --> 00:48:04.210
expansion of the human,
the by far.

822
00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:06.910
And we're in the middle of a wave and we can't even,

823
00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:09.790
we can't realize we're in the middle of it cause it's two banana.

824
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:13.720
<v 5>It's also a lot of it is super important and a lot of it is bullshit.</v>

825
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:17.400
So like the way a lot of it is,
I am I,
why am I drinking?

826
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.860
Intellectuals only use the word intellectual.
That's what I'm saying.
I'm sorry.

827
00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:24.190
No,
I was want,
no,

828
00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:29.080
now I don't remember what Dario talking nonsense,

829
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:33.250
which is,
I apologize.
It's my fault.
It's my fault.
Absolutely.

830
00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:37.980
I said how high rise,
I don't know.
We were talking about how yes,
yeah,

831
00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.030
yeah.
It's,
it's,
it's,
it's amazing.

832
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:43.620
The interesting because it used to be there were genuinely,
you know,

833
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:46.990
a couple TV channels,
a couple of,
you know,
newspapers,

834
00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:50.920
like there weren't a lot of things and now you can get it from everywhere.

835
00:48:50.921 --> 00:48:53.170
And I think that is what you were getting at before.
It's just,
it's,

836
00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:56.710
I think it's good for everyone.
It's good for democracy that,
you know,
one,

837
00:48:56.770 --> 00:49:01.770
one or two or three sort of information areas versus 10 million or a hundred

838
00:49:03.551 --> 00:49:08.050
million.
Cause you can get it from everywhere.
The problem is,
is you don't know.

839
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:12.070
And we'll look back in retrospect and we'll say,
okay,
you know,

840
00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:16.510
Snowden was a big thing or it wasn't,
or you know,
whoever would like,

841
00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:19.420
wikileaks was a big thing.
It wasn't,
but you know,

842
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:24.130
that's the whole thing is you were deluged with so much information on Twitter

843
00:49:24.131 --> 00:49:27.220
for example.
Half of it's fucking,
you know,

844
00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.110
people making bull shit and saying shit.
And then,

845
00:49:29.111 --> 00:49:31.900
but the other half is like actually people saying some really great shit.

846
00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.880
<v 0>People say a lot of great shit on Twitter.</v>

847
00:49:33.881 --> 00:49:38.740
I hear really smart points from a lot of people and there's a lot of people that

848
00:49:38.741 --> 00:49:41.830
I've communicated with on Twitter that have sent me hip to a la shit.

849
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.470
<v 5>The amount of links that you get every day of amazing shit that people are just</v>

850
00:49:46.471 --> 00:49:48.570
like,
you know what?
You gotta do this,
you got to do a story on this.

851
00:49:48.571 --> 00:49:51.150
You've got to do a story on this.
We're doing a story now and Russia,

852
00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:54.040
which I'd never heard about genetic passports.
Have you heard about this?

853
00:49:54.041 --> 00:49:57.150
So what have you heard about it?
No,
but you're freaking me out.

854
00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:59.280
What's the genetic passport?
Oh Dude.

855
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.340
So we got my toes across.
Well,

856
00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:07.530
it's interesting.
You're all right.
But we,
it's interesting cause we got this,

857
00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:11.940
this hookup to Twitter and what it is,
is they,
the,
the,

858
00:50:11.941 --> 00:50:13.350
the Russians actually the Sylvia,

859
00:50:13.351 --> 00:50:18.180
it's to go back to our 1941 Karma conversation after a World War II,

860
00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:22.710
there's a cold war and they were,
uh,
experimenting with atomic bombs on people,

861
00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:26.340
like not on like buildings and shit.
And like we did here in Nevada,

862
00:50:26.341 --> 00:50:27.500
but on people.

863
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.460
So there's this area of cosmic Stein with about 300,000,

864
00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:33.260
400,000 people that were,

865
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:37.610
they just over the years I experimented with on,
with radiation,

866
00:50:37.611 --> 00:50:40.580
with actually blowing up bombs near them.
A lot of them died,

867
00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:44.450
a lot of them didn't die.
And they,
what they had is they had genetic mutations,

868
00:50:44.451 --> 00:50:46.790
so they became mutants.
Like it's like x men type shit.

869
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:50.630
So they become mutants in this area and they're actually not allowed to leave

870
00:50:50.631 --> 00:50:52.130
the area and all this shit.
But anyways,

871
00:50:52.131 --> 00:50:56.170
they start passing on a corrupt DNA strains,
uh,

872
00:50:56.330 --> 00:51:00.470
to their offspring.
So they're the,
it gets worse as they go.
Oh No.

873
00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:05.680
And so now what they're trying to do to stop it is to have genetic passports

874
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:10.040
where they're not allowed to reproduce.
They're not allowed to do this.

875
00:51:10.740 --> 00:51:13.760
And so it's like,
it's,
it literally is the modern x man.

876
00:51:13.761 --> 00:51:17.300
It's fucking the mutans versus,
and so,
uh,

877
00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:21.580
it's this whole cover up,
this whole thing and we're going over there now,
uh,

878
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:25.010
shooting it.
We,
we have a couple of whistle blowers,
but like

879
00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:28.620
<v 2>that's the type of shooting.
Are we talking here?
Well,</v>

880
00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:30.860
is that allowed to say anymore?
And My,
my,

881
00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:35.910
my commute and phobia and my immune phobic,
they're,
they,
they are,

882
00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:36.783
they are there

883
00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:41.830
<v 5>technically human mutans like genetic mutations that you have to have a,</v>

884
00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:48.740
uh,
genetic passport.
And,
and by the way,
this brings up a lot of philosophical,

885
00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:52.910
philosophical questions.
Not Intellectual questions,

886
00:51:52.911 --> 00:51:56.960
philosophical questions,
but because you have a generic password,
you're saying,

887
00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:01.910
okay,
you can now can't reproduce.
You now can like interact.

888
00:52:01.911 --> 00:52:03.440
You can now can't leave this area.

889
00:52:03.441 --> 00:52:08.210
You can't do whatever because we made you radioactive.
And you're like,
well,

890
00:52:08.211 --> 00:52:08.930
hold on a second.

891
00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:12.290
I didn't fucking ask to be remade radioactive and I can't reproduce now and

892
00:52:12.291 --> 00:52:14.890
whatever.
And like it's,
it's,
it's actually a map.

893
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:18.770
<v 2>Civ.
They're not allowed to soft news.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.</v>

894
00:52:18.771 --> 00:52:21.560
They're not allowed.
That's the genetic passport.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

895
00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:25.130
They want to stop the mutant strains.
This is all true by the way.

896
00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:29.630
This is the fastest is all true.
It's fascinating idea.
Now what,

897
00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:33.680
when you say Mutant,
like do they exhibit any sort of special powers?

898
00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:39.200
I can't believe I'm asking you this.
Kmart,
Bell,
Art Bell,

899
00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:43.680
<v 5>Lee.
Uh,
the majority of mutations are and,</v>

900
00:52:43.681 --> 00:52:48.250
and much like in gentleman with the animals,
it's like enlarge livers,

901
00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:53.350
you know,
massive spleens um,
you know,
you know,

902
00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:57.970
<v 2>elephant Titus of the balls.
Like it's never anything,
by the way,</v>

903
00:52:57.971 --> 00:53:02.020
all respect to art bell.
I'm saying that as a fan.

904
00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:05.230
I'm a huge art bell fan.
It's been,
uh,
art bell fan forever.

905
00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.960
So when I say I just became art bell,
obviously I'm choking.

906
00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:11.410
That guy's awesome man.
He's a,
apparently he's going to do radio again.

907
00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:15.010
I used to come home from the comedy store every night listening to coast to

908
00:53:15.011 --> 00:53:18.010
coast with art bell.
You ever watched it?
He listened to that show.

909
00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:22.600
I have listened to it.
I know our bell.
Yeah.
It's still the best.
Who's the best?

910
00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:25.980
Who?
Can I ask you a question that I always to ask you this

911
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.810
<v 5>and I'm wanting to ask you this for three times.
Whenever the fuck has been.</v>

912
00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:33.030
Who's your favorite comedian ever?

913
00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:36.910
<v 0>I always say Sam Kennison for one year.</v>

914
00:53:36.911 --> 00:53:40.620
I had mark Marin on yesterday and Marin who uh,

915
00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:46.020
was 21 during Kinnisons Hay day and actually lived with Kinison.

916
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:48.960
I mean he was in the Crest Hill House.

917
00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:52.240
There was partying with them and do them below with Kennison like incomplete

918
00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:57.390
craziness.
The story was absolutely fantastic.
I was in my glory.

919
00:53:57.610 --> 00:54:01.000
So if I had to say like who is the best,
I say Kennison for 12 months,

920
00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:03.010
I think it's Kennison for 12 months,

921
00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:06.400
which were like 86 [inaudible] 87 was the greatest comedian of all time and we

922
00:54:06.401 --> 00:54:11.200
all pale in the shadows.
But Richard Pryor was the most influential.

923
00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:14.740
Sure.
There's like,
but Lenny Bruce had exists for Richard Pride to exist.

924
00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:15.980
You know,
it's like the,

925
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:20.950
there was like a whole series of guys and you can't minimalize each guy's

926
00:54:20.951 --> 00:54:24.910
impact.
So if someone says,
who's your favorite comedian?
I said,
Lenny Bruce.

927
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:28.540
And the reason why is because Lenny Bruce was the guy who did it.

928
00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:31.590
He was the guy who opened up the doors,
went to jail,
you know,

929
00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:35.360
one on stage and did this whole bit about,
we have to,

930
00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:37.990
if you say nigger enough times,

931
00:54:37.991 --> 00:54:41.560
like eventually it's not gonna mean anything and it won't hurt some small,

932
00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:44.020
you know,
black child's feelings.
He had this whole bit about,

933
00:54:44.021 --> 00:54:47.440
this is an incredibly powerful philosophical bit about the,

934
00:54:47.441 --> 00:54:51.760
the nature of a hate words,
the power that they give,
you know,

935
00:54:51.761 --> 00:54:55.180
if you don't use them,
if you don't use them all the time,
if it become rare,

936
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.601
you know what I mean?

937
00:54:55.601 --> 00:54:58.510
It's a brilliant point and it's a brilliant objective point.

938
00:54:58.511 --> 00:55:01.600
And then you stop and thanks to this guy did this and like 1950 something,

939
00:55:01.930 --> 00:55:05.160
but he didn't,
he was on another Lego at all the legal shit that happens.

940
00:55:05.161 --> 00:55:05.831
It's horrible.

941
00:55:05.831 --> 00:55:09.940
And what happened even after that is more horrible because he stopped being

942
00:55:09.941 --> 00:55:10.660
funny.

943
00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:13.750
He stopped being philosophical and he would go on stage with his legal notes and

944
00:55:13.751 --> 00:55:17.230
read out of them and you know,
they'd go,
come on dirty Lenny.

945
00:55:17.231 --> 00:55:18.520
They just call him dirty Lenny.

946
00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:20.950
You know like people wanted him to talk about sex,

947
00:55:20.951 --> 00:55:24.370
they wanted him to talk about blowjobs.
It's just like unheard of stuff.

948
00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:29.260
But if you,
unfortunately in the Commons is a weird thing,

949
00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:33.160
whereas it's really,
it gets dated,
you know,

950
00:55:33.161 --> 00:55:36.790
like music does not get dated as badly as comedy does.

951
00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:41.940
And it's hard to listen to like a Lenny Bruce like album and understand the

952
00:55:42.221 --> 00:55:45.790
impact it would have had back then.
Like I still think it's amusing.

953
00:55:45.791 --> 00:55:49.170
I sense some of his points are hilarious.
He had this joke about homosexuals,

954
00:55:49.171 --> 00:55:53.830
he's like a,
he goes,
oh,
being a homosexual is illegal.
Dig.
So what do they do?

955
00:55:53.831 --> 00:55:55.590
They they taking,
they put me in jail.

956
00:55:55.591 --> 00:55:59.680
The bunch of guys want to have sex with you.
Okay.
Was like,
it was like,

957
00:55:59.681 --> 00:56:02.350
it was almost like a Mitch Hedberg before his time,
you know?

958
00:56:02.650 --> 00:56:07.480
I mean there's some of it that's very funny,
but it's so dated that the,
the,

959
00:56:07.481 --> 00:56:11.270
the,
the references are so dated,
the concepts are dated,

960
00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:15.100
but Kennison is not dated.
And who's the funniest now?

961
00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.540
The one who makes me laugh the most is probably Joey.

962
00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:23.110
Thank you.
Hear that.
He just said,

963
00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:27.580
come on Joey Diaz makes me laugh harder than anybody.

964
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:30.280
He's just,
there's bursts of,

965
00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:34.330
there's moments when Joey Diaz is on stage where it's funny than anything that

966
00:56:34.331 --> 00:56:38.320
has ever happened in the world.
There's moments where Joey Diaz,

967
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:39.970
he hits these notes,

968
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:44.680
he says some shit sometimes they're just literally makes me fall onto the
ground.

969
00:56:44.681 --> 00:56:48.370
I'll roll around in the airport,
I'll be on my back and airport,
like crying,

970
00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:50.710
laughing.
He's the funniest dude ever to me.

971
00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.410
And this is not just cause I love him and he's my brother.

972
00:56:53.411 --> 00:56:57.370
But I've been around that dude for like more than a decade.

973
00:56:57.371 --> 00:57:00.430
There's no one person who's made me laugh more than him.

974
00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:01.480
And it's like if I had to like,

975
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:05.850
like all the laughs that I've ever achieved in my life and put it like Joey d,

976
00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:08.110
the Joey [inaudible] files,
like up to the ceiling.

977
00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:12.730
It's piling over like the stacks of laughs from all my friends.
But with Joey,

978
00:57:12.731 --> 00:57:15.670
it's ridiculous.
I can't even really compare him to other comics.
He was like,

979
00:57:15.671 --> 00:57:19.110
he's in a different categories,
different kinds of human being.
Yeah.

980
00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:23.230
He's just the funniest guy of all time.
I've met a lot of fucking funny people,

981
00:57:23.231 --> 00:57:25.570
man.
I've seen the greats.

982
00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:29.950
I've seen Richard Pryor live a seen kicks live.
I've seen,

983
00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:35.080
I've seen Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle and Louis C K I've seen them all live,

984
00:57:35.740 --> 00:57:39.850
you know,
is your favorite chain.
Nobody could fuck with Joey Diaz is my,

985
00:57:39.851 --> 00:57:42.880
my favorite comedian and an hour of all now.
I mean,

986
00:57:42.881 --> 00:57:47.000
Richard Pryor has to be of all time.
I think he's like,
yeah,

987
00:57:48.550 --> 00:57:53.050
yeah.
If you want to go with the most influential,
this is what I feel like.

988
00:57:53.051 --> 00:57:56.020
I feel like it's Lenny Bruce and then slightly more.

989
00:57:56.460 --> 00:57:58.900
<v 5>Also,
if you look at,
if you look at Richard Prior,</v>

990
00:57:58.910 --> 00:58:03.250
the reason why I say Richard Pryor is his standup was like Red Fox on fucking

991
00:58:03.251 --> 00:58:06.730
steroids.
I also love Red Fox,
but he was on like,
and you know,

992
00:58:06.731 --> 00:58:09.980
grew up in a whore house.
All that shit.
Awesome.
He worked at Red Fox is club,

993
00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:15.340
but then what?
I really love it shit like,
uh,
you know his,

994
00:58:15.370 --> 00:58:20.070
his,
his gene wilder sort of,
you know,
movies for the masses.
You know,

995
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:24.900
I'm thinking of the one where they go to the weather,
the Rodeo and the,

996
00:58:24.970 --> 00:58:28.390
they have to do the Rodeo.
Whoa.
What's that?
They go to Joe.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

997
00:58:28.391 --> 00:58:31.930
I don't remember,
but he was very fun.
Unbelievably funny.

998
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:34.240
Very funny in those movies.
Come on.
What's that movie?

999
00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:39.200
I don't remember any of those movie stir crazy or something.
That's good.

1000
00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:42.910
God Damn Shit.
I broke your head here.
All right.
Leave it alone.

1001
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:47.420
Stir crazy because I'll tell you why.
Because he was doing all the,
the,

1002
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:50.350
the sort of crazy underground shit and,

1003
00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:55.580
and like fucked up and whores and drugs and fucking crazy mixed company here.

1004
00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:01.840
Right?
And then,
but also doing the movies that were just like fucking hilarious.

1005
00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:07.780
<v 0>If I had to put like,
um,
who had the like the most impact on culture?</v>

1006
00:59:07.781 --> 00:59:08.620
I would say prior.

1007
00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:12.460
The only reason why I say Kennison was the best for a year because I think it

1008
00:59:12.461 --> 00:59:17.461
was the most extraordinary example of a guy who was utterly amazing and

1009
00:59:17.891 --> 00:59:22.550
astonishing and impactful and then deteriorated before our eyes.

1010
00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:27.110
Like a,
a really almost a cartoonish version of himself,

1011
00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:30.350
a caricature of himself.
He just,

1012
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:35.380
he fell into everything that was wrong with being famous hook,
line,

1013
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:38.540
sinker.
Yes.
But he was the greatest of all time for 12 months.

1014
00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:40.610
Even better than prior.
I just,
the,

1015
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:45.170
my feeling is that prior is the greater comedian.
He was a greater craftsmen.

1016
00:59:45.171 --> 00:59:47.780
He's a great,
the more honest,
the more insightful,

1017
00:59:47.781 --> 00:59:49.610
the more socially for a long time.

1018
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:52.430
He did it for a long time and he was never bad.
He was never bad.

1019
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:55.130
He was just as good the day he died.
I mean,

1020
00:59:55.131 --> 00:59:59.150
he had a hard time when he came back from ms and they would carry him on stage.

1021
00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:03.920
I don't count those sets.
I did six weeks with a dude six weeks ahead of time.

1022
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.030
I did.
I'm at the store,
I,
I followed him for five,

1023
01:00:08.031 --> 01:00:12.890
it was about five and a half weeks and he would go up like two or three nights a

1024
01:00:12.891 --> 01:00:16.810
week and they would carry him onto the stage and he was,

1025
01:00:16.811 --> 01:00:20.210
but it was really hard though.
It's hard for him to communicate and you know,

1026
01:00:20.211 --> 01:00:23.450
but yeah,
people want him to see him before he went.

1027
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:25.760
That's what it was essentially.
And it was packed.

1028
01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:27.680
It was packed like almost every night.

1029
01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.360
So if you had to say who's the greatest comedian of all time?

1030
01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:37.340
I would say it's a tie.
It's prior for the,

1031
01:00:37.341 --> 01:00:41.600
the length of the career and the w w w the emotional attachment,

1032
01:00:41.601 --> 01:00:43.160
the love that you got from his sets.

1033
01:00:43.161 --> 01:00:47.090
Like you got like a positivity from his sats.
You got a also,

1034
01:00:47.091 --> 01:00:50.690
he was just naturally fucking funny.
He was brilliant.
He was brilliant.

1035
01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:55.670
But Kennison was nother thing,
man for 12 months or whatever the hell it was,

1036
01:00:55.671 --> 01:01:00.380
1416 months.
He was another thing,
man,
he was a mother fucker.

1037
01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:04.790
He would cause the people who don't know what comedy was like back then.

1038
01:01:04.791 --> 01:01:07.730
Have a hard time understanding.
Sure.
But if you were alive,

1039
01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:12.410
you get into it from him from,
sure,
for sure.
It was two people.

1040
01:01:12.411 --> 01:01:14.570
It was prior in him,
his prior,
when I was a little kid,

1041
01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:18.650
my parents took me to see live that sunset strip and I was in this theater and I

1042
01:01:18.651 --> 01:01:22.850
remember in the middle of it dying laughing.
I remember,
I don't remember the bit,

1043
01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.310
but I was dying.
I couldn't believe how hard it was laughing.

1044
01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:30.140
And then I remember like holding my sides laughing Sarna and looking around at

1045
01:01:30.141 --> 01:01:33.680
all these people rocking back and forth in their chairs,

1046
01:01:33.681 --> 01:01:38.270
laughing so hard and then thinking,
this is just a guy talking.
Oh,

1047
01:01:38.271 --> 01:01:39.104
he's still in his talk.

1048
01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:42.200
And I thought about all the movies and I had seen that I really liked like

1049
01:01:42.201 --> 01:01:44.690
stripes,
like hilarious,
hilarious movies.

1050
01:01:44.691 --> 01:01:46.580
So I thought it was like the funniest thing you could ever see.

1051
01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.580
And then all the sudden I'm seeing this guy and all he's doing is talking and

1052
01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:52.160
it's so much funnier than that.
He didn't need a Winnebago,

1053
01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:55.220
he didn't need anything.
So that was the first,

1054
01:01:55.221 --> 01:01:59.840
that was my first inkling of standup and then Kennison was like probably the

1055
01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:03.290
reason why I thought maybe I could do it because I my,

1056
01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:07.730
my sense of humor was so much darker than like what I was seeing on like

1057
01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:09.150
television or what else.

1058
01:02:09.151 --> 01:02:13.000
There was so much more wild than when I was seeing on so much of a wild man

1059
01:02:14.010 --> 01:02:17.210
lives and stuff.
Wearing mood rings mysterious.

1060
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:20.250
I grew up with Steve Martin,
then Joe Rogan

1061
01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:24.480
<v 5>and Doug Stanhope pry my biggest influences and Joe Rogan made it in there.</v>

1062
01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:28.320
Hell yeah.
Hello.

1063
01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:32.090
I've seen Joe Rogan probably more than any more than anybody in the planet for

1064
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:32.610
sure.

1065
01:02:32.610 --> 01:02:35.280
There's more pictures of me and him together then to me with any other human

1066
01:02:35.281 --> 01:02:38.610
that's ever existed.
Who are the new bad boy?
He's like Jim Norton.

1067
01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.720
<v 0>Norns excellent.
Yeah,
for sure.</v>

1068
01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:45.040
This is a great time for stand up comedy because this is a great time for self

1069
01:02:45.041 --> 01:02:45.874
promotion.

1070
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:50.100
But people like Thomson Cora Thompson and his wife Christina Palicki top scores

1071
01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:51.670
is one of the best fucking comics in the country.

1072
01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:55.300
But it's just letting the world know about it.
That's all it's missing.

1073
01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.800
Is it fear?
Fear.

1074
01:02:56.801 --> 01:03:00.400
One of the best comics in the country and people are people because of the,

1075
01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.850
the whole death squad network are sort of getting clued in to like,

1076
01:03:03.851 --> 01:03:06.700
who's who we're,
if we're hanging out with people,

1077
01:03:06.701 --> 01:03:09.160
it's because they're funny if for bringing people around cause they're funny.

1078
01:03:09.190 --> 01:03:12.730
And so it's spreading.
And in turn they're introducing nug.

1079
01:03:12.731 --> 01:03:15.190
Brian's constantly introducing new people into the mix.

1080
01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.580
He sees people at the comedy store,
he introduced him into the mix and then boom,

1081
01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:22.360
we know Tony Hinchcliffe now.
Hilarious Tony Hinchcliffe.
And that's,

1082
01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:25.330
that's like that.
This is a rare time for that.

1083
01:03:25.331 --> 01:03:28.630
It's a rare time where the expansion of of,

1084
01:03:28.631 --> 01:03:31.250
of comics has been so easy and the,

1085
01:03:31.251 --> 01:03:32.950
the ability to promote people's been swimming.

1086
01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:36.640
<v 5>I wanted to ask you this question and you know,
uh,
last time we,</v>

1087
01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:41.120
I was going to jail,
you know,
you've changed the world.
I love you,
but it was,

1088
01:03:41.121 --> 01:03:45.530
that was unimpressed.
That was me impression of me doing me drunk.

1089
01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:50.060
Oh God.
I was like,
I love you.
I Dunno,
I become 90 years old.

1090
01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.400
But what I wanted to say is like every time we do,
I get,
I actually,

1091
01:03:55.401 --> 01:03:58.250
I was in Houston coming back from Central America night.

1092
01:03:58.370 --> 01:04:02.990
This guy came up to me in a full on,
uh,
like,
I dunno,

1093
01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:06.480
Sherpa gear.
No,
like fuck it,
you know,

1094
01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:10.100
the bright orange,
you're going,
you know what I'm talking about?

1095
01:04:10.101 --> 01:04:12.350
The Bright Orange Nascar uniform things like,

1096
01:04:12.351 --> 01:04:15.770
he was like a air traffic controller out there,
but one of these guys,

1097
01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:18.110
but those guys,
what are the traffic controller right on the ground,

1098
01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:22.290
ground ground graph through the guy with a flashlight.
He came up,

1099
01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:27.230
he came up to me and he was like,
fucking Joe Rogan fucking,

1100
01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:30.890
you know,
you and Joe Rogan and fucking awesome.

1101
01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:35.720
And he was just maybe the best guy I've ever met and he was just like,

1102
01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:36.470
you know,

1103
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:40.700
I was in the city airport and he was just so stoked and he was like death squad

1104
01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:44.690
desk and he showed me all this shit and then when he took a picture of me right

1105
01:04:44.691 --> 01:04:46.190
me and he said,
can I take a picture?
I go,
yeah,

1106
01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:51.520
you took a picture of me and then some other death squad dude put it up on Times

1107
01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:53.600
Square like in a Photoshop,

1108
01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:57.040
what I've seen and then everybody went and I was like,

1109
01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:01.110
fucking desk squad shit is crazy.
And what do you,
what?

1110
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.480
I want to say a what the fuck is going on with that and be what?

1111
01:05:05.481 --> 01:05:09.200
Like how did it happen?
Like you guys have created this fucking amazing shit.

1112
01:05:09.201 --> 01:05:13.330
I got this too.
There's two sort of branches of it.
I'm listening,
I'm good.

1113
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:16.190
I'm going to ask a question.
It's like,

1114
01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.100
and then I'm just going to leave you because I don't

1115
01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.290
<v 2>give a shit about what you're saying.
What are you getting in there?</v>

1116
01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:24.010
What could he possibly be getting it there?
What is he getting?
What?

1117
01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:28.480
I'm listening when you get in there ice,
I got something.
How dare you.

1118
01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.650
Okay.
The world,
my drink.

1119
01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.240
I'm going to ask you any questions ranking already.
I haven't even ate yet today.

1120
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:42.010
No,
it was bad.
You know,
all it is is really at this point,
there's two,
two,

1121
01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:45.220
two branches.
One is all the stuff that Brian's doing,
Brian,

1122
01:05:45.221 --> 01:05:49.000
what he calls his network is the desk squad podcast network.

1123
01:05:49.001 --> 01:05:54.001
And it's a great connection to a lot of people that maybe you don't know or

1124
01:05:54.131 --> 01:05:56.320
maybe you do know and you'd never heard him talk like that.

1125
01:05:56.321 --> 01:05:58.930
Like Kevin Pereira or there's that.

1126
01:05:58.931 --> 01:06:01.120
And then there's all just sort of what we call all of us,

1127
01:06:01.121 --> 01:06:05.350
whether it's Ari or Dunkin or we don't really call all of us,
we don't.

1128
01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:10.270
But with this seal of approval of comics and friends that were all friends,

1129
01:06:10.430 --> 01:06:12.760
that's a good way of putting it.
But why is it and it to seal,

1130
01:06:12.761 --> 01:06:16.930
but it seems a little bit more than it was like more political and there,

1131
01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:20.660
but it's not if it chooses to be,
it's not our doing.
We're not,

1132
01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:25.420
all we're doing is saying all we ever say the bottom line,
don't be a con.

1133
01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:28.460
That's number one.
And number two,
like if I,

1134
01:06:28.461 --> 01:06:31.930
if I tell you the Duncan trussell's funny,
believe me,
I'm not going to bullshit.

1135
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:36.430
You know?
So if we're all connected like that,
like you can guarantee you,

1136
01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:39.970
if I tell you Joey Diaz,
the funniest guy I've ever fucking seen in my life,

1137
01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:42.670
you're going to see what I'm talking about.
If you go see him live,
you know,

1138
01:06:42.671 --> 01:06:46.300
and so this sort of connection with each other like that,
you know,

1139
01:06:46.301 --> 01:06:49.750
like Brian Brian,
Brian told me about Tony Hinchcliffe.
He's like,
dude,

1140
01:06:49.751 --> 01:06:52.990
there's this guy,
you got to see him,
this young guy.
But seeing him at the store,

1141
01:06:52.991 --> 01:06:55.180
he's really fucking funny.
Like,
and he says,

1142
01:06:55.181 --> 01:06:56.440
I'm going to have him on one of these shows,

1143
01:06:56.441 --> 01:07:00.280
like the desk quad shows at the Ice House.
So he puts them on and then boom,

1144
01:07:00.281 --> 01:07:04.540
we know Tony Hinchcliffe is a bad motherfucker.
Rights for the burn now.
Yeah,

1145
01:07:04.541 --> 01:07:08.140
he's got like a real career and I brought him with me to Indianapolis,

1146
01:07:08.141 --> 01:07:09.940
the kids fucking hilarious.
Right?
It's like,

1147
01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:14.740
so what it's allowing is we can bypass all those other systems.

1148
01:07:14.741 --> 01:07:16.840
We don't have to,
you don't have to be on the tonight show anymore.

1149
01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.700
You don't have to wait for an HBO special.
I mean,
you can say death squad.

1150
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:25.520
Love is his fucking,
it's also using subliminal messaging,

1151
01:07:25.521 --> 01:07:30.490
like using the planned cash till the whole thing.
This is the best part about it,

1152
01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:31.660
is it nobody,

1153
01:07:31.690 --> 01:07:36.430
nobody like is running it and nobody asked for it and nobody,
no,
no,

1154
01:07:36.431 --> 01:07:39.580
no one's in charge.
No one's,
no one knows the fuck's going on.

1155
01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.460
You know what I'm saying?
Like we don't have an agenda.
There's no agenda.

1156
01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:43.493
We don't happen to it.

1157
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:47.320
Like a little bit older and then all of a sudden you start to let a few into the

1158
01:07:47.321 --> 01:07:49.570
farm and if you're more than that,
it's pretty soon.
And you're like,

1159
01:07:50.020 --> 01:07:54.550
I've got 10,000 of these mother fuckers is no farm.
What?
Starting a civilization.

1160
01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:58.870
I knew you want to,
I don't want to say new civilization,

1161
01:07:58.871 --> 01:08:02.440
I don't want to say intellectual,
but it will be a utopian,

1162
01:08:03.290 --> 01:08:07.540
it's impossible.
Not In this lifetime.
Not unless a ray Kurzweil's correct.

1163
01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.640
They're going to come get you.
You download con.
If you started at court,

1164
01:08:10.641 --> 01:08:13.620
they would get come get my call wouldn't do shit.
No.
My call,

1165
01:08:13.621 --> 01:08:14.710
it would just go like fishing.

1166
01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:18.290
My company doesn't want to have anything to do with what you're doing.
If I,

1167
01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:19.071
if I had to call it,

1168
01:08:19.071 --> 01:08:23.030
the last thing I'd want is to dominate the financial markets like you guys can

1169
01:08:23.031 --> 01:08:25.400
have.
That's all you did,
right?
Have a good time.

1170
01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:27.700
We're going to have you want to dominate?
We're going to do Jujitsu.

1171
01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.610
We got to go fishing.
We're going to smoke weed and tell jokes.
Okay.

1172
01:08:31.611 --> 01:08:32.151
Is it all right?

1173
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:35.900
We'll just be over here and you swear to God we're not going to do nothing.
Yeah.

1174
01:08:35.901 --> 01:08:39.290
You use the coupon code [inaudible] and save 10% off all home grown mangoes.

1175
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:43.340
If I had a call,
two would be the easiest cult ever.
Like go stay.

1176
01:08:43.341 --> 01:08:46.790
I don't know what he gives a fuck.
Okay.
Nobody's trying to take over shit.

1177
01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:52.250
All right.
I'm going to remember that the,
I think the culture is coming.
No,

1178
01:08:52.251 --> 01:08:55.100
because they're spreading their own cults to like,
there's like,

1179
01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.970
like if you go to like all these,
uh,
Twitter pages now,
it's like death squad.

1180
01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:01.660
St Louis,
definitely.
I,
yeah,
that's what I'm saying.
Yeah.

1181
01:09:01.730 --> 01:09:04.560
That's why they're doing that.
No one asked him to do that.
Brian didn't know.

1182
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:08.420
I didn't ask him to do that.
And by the way,
when they do it,
nobody says anything.

1183
01:09:08.421 --> 01:09:11.690
We don't,
I've never said any,
hey,
you can't do that,
or hey,
you shouldn't do that.

1184
01:09:11.691 --> 01:09:14.870
Or Hey,
we don't know you.
Or,
Hey,
what are you doing?
Why'd you choose that name?

1185
01:09:14.871 --> 01:09:19.340
Or no one cares,
you know,
like,
dude,
what the fuck you want to do?
Right.
That's,

1186
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:22.310
that's the thing.
It's pretty awesome.
Well,
it's unexpected.

1187
01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:27.230
It's unexpected and unplanned and so completely uncontrolled.

1188
01:09:27.231 --> 01:09:30.830
And uh,
not only that,
but no one takes credit for it.
It's beautiful.
It's great.

1189
01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:34.390
It's just sort of like how I like how you're like,
it's unplanned on credit.
Uh,

1190
01:09:34.710 --> 01:09:36.860
you know that they're listening to it.
It doesn't matter.

1191
01:09:36.861 --> 01:09:40.370
We're not doing anything.
Go Look,
look,

1192
01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:41.960
if I had the society,

1193
01:09:41.961 --> 01:09:44.570
the perfect society wouldn't be taken over this fucking mess.

1194
01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:48.080
It would be like living near a lake and having a solar panel that he's my

1195
01:09:48.081 --> 01:09:52.340
fucking TV.
You know,
I,
I wouldn't be taking over the governor.
Love it.
Heated TV.

1196
01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:56.690
Yeah man.
I want to be able to,
you know,
get satellite,
whatever.

1197
01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.520
Get direct TV for in the middle of nowhere.

1198
01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:03.320
The last thing I would ever want to do is have any position of power over

1199
01:10:03.321 --> 01:10:07.010
anybody ever anywhere.
I don't even like having employees.

1200
01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:11.360
That's why my my loan employees,
they're both fucking crazy.
Look at him.

1201
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:14.720
These two dudes are savages.
I can't have like a regular employee,

1202
01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:18.380
some regular dude.
It's,
I can't even communicate with people like that.

1203
01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.453
I'm worried now.

1204
01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.220
I think I'm going to go farm and there's going to be a lot of people.

1205
01:10:22.221 --> 01:10:25.670
There will be no count.
Me thinks like it does for cats too much.

1206
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:32.180
Well,
Brian's letting out the cute,
those are on the side of the cheerios box.

1207
01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:37.520
<v 1>Um,
so the relationship park in China,
do you know the act,</v>

1208
01:10:37.521 --> 01:10:40.240
the exact address for this?
[inaudible] had a,
uh,

1209
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:43.130
I think it was episode three of your show.
It was all about,
uh,

1210
01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.780
I didn't know that there's more women than men in China.
50 million,

1211
01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:52.790
50 million more men,
men,
the man anymore,
man.
Man,
man,
man,

1212
01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:56.570
they do these things where they go to these like parks with like pretty much

1213
01:10:56.571 --> 01:10:59.580
like,
it's like their profile.
Like this is how much money I make.
This is my,

1214
01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.473
my house.
And it was,

1215
01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:03.300
and you had sent one of your reporters there to actually try it.

1216
01:11:03.330 --> 01:11:08.120
He didn't look like he succeeded in any of that.
It didn't work out.

1217
01:11:08.121 --> 01:11:11.990
Um,
uh,
it's pretty funny when Thomas goes there,

1218
01:11:11.991 --> 01:11:14.130
but it's actually pretty sad.
They have 50 million.

1219
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:17.820
<v 5>What does that,
that's a size of a fairly big country.
50 million.</v>

1220
01:11:17.821 --> 01:11:22.710
50 million more men than women.
Oh God.
And so you have,
and the problem is,

1221
01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:24.960
is that you have,
um,

1222
01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:30.330
most of the women moved to the city so that,
you know,
in the cities it's okay,

1223
01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:33.750
it's hard,
but it's okay.
But in the countryside,
it's just dudes.

1224
01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:38.010
And actually one of the things that we wanted to shoot,
uh,

1225
01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.680
which we couldn't get because they,

1226
01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:44.700
the government fucking freaked out was they have these towns that are,

1227
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:49.740
um,
just like prostitute towns and,
and,

1228
01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:51.720
and the only women in them are prostitutes.

1229
01:11:51.721 --> 01:11:55.590
All the men come in from the country and have their sex and then go back out and

1230
01:11:55.591 --> 01:11:59.760
now they're,
they're making these sex robots.
Did we talk about this before?

1231
01:11:59.810 --> 01:12:00.643
I don't think so.
No.

1232
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:04.950
They're making these sort of sex robot brothels because there's literally whole

1233
01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:08.600
towns in the west of China that doesn't have any women.
Yeah,
I think we did.

1234
01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:12.030
I believe we did talk.
We might've been drunk that time.
It's insane story.

1235
01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:12.451
But yeah,

1236
01:12:12.451 --> 01:12:16.620
it's hard to wrap your head around it when you start doing genetic engineering,

1237
01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:21.570
you know,
Shit fucks up.
And,
and in the cities it's harder to get wives and,

1238
01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:24.010
but in the countries there are no women.
Oh my God.

1239
01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:28.290
And so when there are no women,
shit gets fucked up.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
She tossed

1240
01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:31.440
it.
Just terrible,

1241
01:12:31.441 --> 01:12:36.120
terrible idea of controlling the population in that way.
Yeah.

1242
01:12:36.121 --> 01:12:39.120
I mean,
well,
the amount of people that someone can have,
well,

1243
01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:40.950
it's interesting because you say,
you say,
okay,

1244
01:12:40.951 --> 01:12:44.730
well we're just too many people so we have to have one kid,
but you figure,

1245
01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:48.990
well it'd be 50 50 but then if you put societal sort of constraints or cultural

1246
01:12:48.991 --> 01:12:52.470
constraints and say,
well,
we want the lineage to go on so we want a boy.

1247
01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:55.350
So actually they started a boarding girls were getting rid of the girl and then

1248
01:12:55.351 --> 01:12:58.700
all of a sudden you have 50 million,
which in China,
you know it's,

1249
01:12:58.701 --> 01:13:01.410
it's more than a billion people.
So 50 million doesn't seem like a lot,

1250
01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:03.440
but 50 million fucking people.

1251
01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.990
That's the size of Germany and it's more men than women.
They're like,

1252
01:13:06.991 --> 01:13:08.880
that must be just a social chaos.

1253
01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:13.930
Like doing must be so much depression and the relationships you want to eat

1254
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:16.270
pussy whipped dude.
But did you see the guy?
They just,

1255
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:20.340
the most interesting thing I think about that piece is the rich guys actually

1256
01:13:20.341 --> 01:13:24.630
take out billboards for themselves and take to advertise.
It's pretty awesome.

1257
01:13:24.631 --> 01:13:29.370
But the schlubs like the regular guys,
the guys who are like,
you know,

1258
01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:34.140
just a regular dude with a regular job,
they're like,
we cannot get a girl.

1259
01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:35.010
Like we're just,

1260
01:13:35.011 --> 01:13:39.960
we just can't compete to get their regular good guys like doing a good job doing

1261
01:13:39.961 --> 01:13:43.290
whatever.
But they can't compete against the guy buying a fucking billboard like

1262
01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:49.040
crazy.
Go Gay.
Is there a big gay population there or is it,
you know,

1263
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.180
a lot of it in,
in,
in China is,

1264
01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:55.260
is mostly cultural too because it's also like we have to take care of our

1265
01:13:55.261 --> 01:13:59.790
parents and it's a,
it's a sort of economic relationships and all this stuff.
Wow.

1266
01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:03.480
So actually the,
you know,
there are places like,

1267
01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:06.910
let's say Thailand where like,
you know,
the sort of gay population,
sorry.

1268
01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:11.150
But I think in China they're actually coming up with like robotic.
Wow.

1269
01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:14.530
Well the only good thing about that is it no one,
you know,

1270
01:14:14.730 --> 01:14:17.680
maybe within a generation they'll have their population and the control of the

1271
01:14:17.681 --> 01:14:19.960
point where they're going to allow people to have as many kids as they want.

1272
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:24.360
Is that possible?
That's actually declining now.
Whereas India,

1273
01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:28.300
India is now,
I believe,
bigger than China and it,
it,

1274
01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:31.240
it did that in the last five or 10 years.
Oh,
quicker.

1275
01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:34.840
It has the youngest population in the world and because they didn't have any

1276
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:39.430
sort of curtailing and now China has sort of leveled off or declining and India

1277
01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:41.930
just went through the roof.
Wow.
Yeah.

1278
01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:45.070
India seems like a really insane place.

1279
01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:48.790
I've had friends that told me they went to India and like as soon as they got

1280
01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:52.050
over there that felt like they made a mistake.
Like this is like,

1281
01:14:52.090 --> 01:14:55.240
this is too much.
It's too crazy.
Too many,
too many bags.

1282
01:14:55.270 --> 01:15:00.270
Definitely gives you an insight into what cities used to be like because they

1283
01:15:00.501 --> 01:15:03.470
already have and have not there as well.
That's like stag road.

1284
01:15:03.471 --> 01:15:04.800
We did a piece on that.
The,

1285
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:09.950
the most expensive and largest house on the planet is in Mumbai,

1286
01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:16.080
which is a 28 story mansion for one dude.
Right.
Uh,

1287
01:15:16.170 --> 01:15:18.790
cost,
uh,
it has a staff of 380.

1288
01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:21.520
It costs like 400 grand a month just to fucking keep going.

1289
01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:26.140
It's like this crazy skyscraper for one guy.
Wow.
Cut.
But the craziest thing,

1290
01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:30.530
but the thing is,
it comes out of,
it comes out of uh,

1291
01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:34.840
a fucking slum and the slum isn't just like,
like what we think of as a slum.

1292
01:15:34.841 --> 01:15:37.570
Like whenever I come to California,
I'm like,
hold on,
this is a bad neighborhood.

1293
01:15:37.571 --> 01:15:41.110
Everyone's got to fucking house.
Like it's like,
you know,
but,
but,

1294
01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:43.640
but when you're talking about a slum there,
it's like,

1295
01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:49.570
like they have one toilet for every 1700 inhabitants of slow.

1296
01:15:51.670 --> 01:15:54.040
So everything reeks of Shit.

1297
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:58.390
Everything weeks they make all their money off,

1298
01:15:58.510 --> 01:16:00.910
just the garbage of the regular economy.

1299
01:16:00.911 --> 01:16:05.740
So like half the economy of Mumbai is,
we take the garbage,

1300
01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:10.320
whatever that was thrown out,
food,
plastic,
whatever.
And we recycler,

1301
01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:13.510
we redo it and we fucking,
that's it.
And so the thing is,

1302
01:16:13.511 --> 01:16:16.540
is you're sitting there and where people are like sleeping under their sewing

1303
01:16:16.541 --> 01:16:18.100
machines where they make a bucket and stuff,

1304
01:16:18.370 --> 01:16:20.830
and then you walked down the street and then it's like boom,

1305
01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:25.870
straight out of the same thing.
A billion or I think it's 1.8 billion.

1306
01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:30.220
Multi billion over a billion dollar house.
38 stories.

1307
01:16:30.221 --> 01:16:33.940
Two Olympic size swimming pools,
like observation decks,

1308
01:16:33.941 --> 01:16:38.380
400,000 square feet.
And you're like,
you just take the elevator down,

1309
01:16:38.740 --> 01:16:43.740
walk two blocks and you're in like 50 people sleeping in a room this big.

1310
01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:48.670
Yeah,
it's fucked up.
That is so gangster live like that.

1311
01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:53.290
Like that's like so old school gangster.
Well it's a,
yeah,

1312
01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:58.120
it's how the kings used to live.
Everyone was born,
the king was rich.
It's insane.

1313
01:16:58.121 --> 01:17:02.830
What must that guy's reality be like?
Like the beads that far in the opposite.

1314
01:17:02.831 --> 01:17:06.490
You know what's interesting about India is,
I don't know if it's,
if it's,

1315
01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:11.060
you know,
Hinduism or whatever,
but it's like,
they're like,
yeah,

1316
01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:15.170
we're super poor.
We can't eat.
He's got a billion dollar house.
Well,

1317
01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:20.180
really it's not great.
But whereas in Europe they're like,

1318
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:23.030
I'm not going to burn that shit down.

1319
01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:27.950
I'm going to fucking some brave fucking take your shit and I'm going to eat it.

1320
01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:35.120
Yeah.
That would not fly.
Oh,
same thing in Arab spring right now.

1321
01:17:35.121 --> 01:17:37.580
I mean young people are saying,
fuck it,
I don't give a fuck.

1322
01:17:37.930 --> 01:17:41.230
<v 0>Well,
isn't that weird about the world?
Like what we're talking about?
Like the,</v>

1323
01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:46.150
the variations of these different countries and what flies in one place.

1324
01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:50.350
We hear about in some places and you go like,
okay,
how about New Guinea?

1325
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.420
Do you know about those people that live and they,

1326
01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:56.050
the semen warriors of New Guinea.
It is the most

1327
01:17:56.750 --> 01:18:01.190
<v 5>Ernie,
but new Guinea is got every good story in the world.
We're doing it.</v>

1328
01:18:01.191 --> 01:18:03.160
You got it right there.
And I'm sure they got a lot of them,

1329
01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:07.870
like all the crazy like,
you know,
cargo cults,
cargo cults.

1330
01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:13.180
What's the cargo cult?
Come on.
I don't know.
My favorite time cargo.
Yeah.

1331
01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:16.930
Cargo look up cargo cult as I explained what it is.
Okay.

1332
01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:22.200
So Papua New Guinea was a staging point for the American army during World War

1333
01:18:22.450 --> 01:18:25.930
II and they cut these impossible,
uh,

1334
01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:29.620
runways into the jungle.
Right?
And,

1335
01:18:29.650 --> 01:18:33.430
but the people who were living there were like Bronze Age people.

1336
01:18:33.730 --> 01:18:38.030
And so they saw these planes come out and then,
and then you know,

1337
01:18:38.050 --> 01:18:42.290
they would give them like spam and whatever,
like stuff,
you know,

1338
01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:43.293
parachutes.

1339
01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:48.460
And so then the left at the end of the war and the started a whole religion on

1340
01:18:48.461 --> 01:18:48.891
the plane.

1341
01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:52.330
So they built these planes and they come in and they mimic the landing and they

1342
01:18:52.331 --> 01:18:56.430
mimic the people coming out and they still have the American uniforms and the,

1343
01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:56.591
the,

1344
01:18:56.591 --> 01:19:00.190
the tribesmen would like a bone through his nose and you like one dread we'll

1345
01:19:00.191 --> 01:19:04.570
come out with like,
you know,
captain fucking Joe Adams,
you know,
and then they'll,

1346
01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:08.020
they'll bring like the lat,
the empty cam of cans of spam and shit.

1347
01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:12.160
And they have these like planes made out of flowers that they pretend to launch

1348
01:19:12.161 --> 01:19:12.994
and stuff.
And you're like,

1349
01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:17.740
this is the craziest fucking really watching religion they made.

1350
01:19:17.741 --> 01:19:20.610
They made the religion because of the planes,

1351
01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:25.690
you know the beef 52 is coming with supplies and the whole religion is like the

1352
01:19:26.201 --> 01:19:30.550
plane is the vessel of God and the Captain Joe Abrams who comes out is the

1353
01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:32.820
[inaudible] God and the next ring you the spam.

1354
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:36.570
<v 0>Giorgio sucralose would spike his hair up and come in here and say,</v>

1355
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:41.630
is it possible that the reason why these things exist that we learned them from

1356
01:19:43.381 --> 01:19:44.214
aliens?

1357
01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:48.601
Yeah,

1358
01:19:48.601 --> 01:19:53.070
I mean it makes sense if if you lived to stone age life and a plane landed and

1359
01:19:53.071 --> 01:19:54.210
gave you some spam,

1360
01:19:54.211 --> 01:19:58.320
100% it would become folklore and it's gotta be so strange if they are,
they are.

1361
01:19:58.350 --> 01:19:59.700
They are.
They are literate culture.

1362
01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:04.790
<v 5>So no,
I mean hold on.
They just tell stories.
Yeah.
The cargo called,
they do,</v>

1363
01:20:04.791 --> 01:20:09.510
they do the whole religious thing through the reenacting that when the planes

1364
01:20:09.511 --> 01:20:12.690
first landed,
but actually there's a thing now,

1365
01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.790
they are kind of littered now because these,

1366
01:20:14.791 --> 01:20:19.450
these people in New Guinea who are fighting Exxon,
there's a lot of oil there.

1367
01:20:19.451 --> 01:20:21.960
And excellence,
trying to turn to,
um,

1368
01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:26.940
exploit the oil and these,
uh,
hair.
They,
well,
whatever,

1369
01:20:26.941 --> 01:20:27.990
everyone's going to get oil.

1370
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:31.850
Cause if there's fucking oils and one's going to get it,
but they,

1371
01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:36.980
they have this trial but they have this tribe now that's dressing as um,

1372
01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:43.590
you know,
the gods,
the car,
the cargo,

1373
01:20:43.950 --> 01:20:48.950
and they're attacking Exxon dressed as American servicemen from 1942.

1374
01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:56.410
I think the whole theme of this is from American 1942 today.
But like it's,

1375
01:20:56.420 --> 01:21:00.820
it's cause they make big,
huge white helmets.
And then,
uh,

1376
01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:05.820
if you Google God,
that's Google,
uh,
Papa New Guinea versus Exxon.

1377
01:21:06.090 --> 01:21:08.550
And you'll see the crazy outfits they have John's,

1378
01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:14.200
he doesn't know it as bell pass out or New Guinea.
He barely knows how spells,

1379
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:17.610
it's pretty fucking interesting that there's a whole,

1380
01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:19.680
it's a huge country popping is massive.

1381
01:21:20.130 --> 01:21:24.390
And there's a whole like how big Texas sized,
much bigger than Texas.

1382
01:21:24.930 --> 01:21:28.040
And you have a big,
big country where like,
uh,

1383
01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:33.200
like huge pockets of it worship cargo from 1944.

1384
01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:37.530
God,
I changed up 42 to 40.
Is there,

1385
01:21:37.860 --> 01:21:41.400
is there a big city like we can go and get Wifi and the Starbucks,

1386
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:46.440
um,
does that too.
There's that too.
It's just like a cheesecake factory there.

1387
01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:51.330
There might be like,
can you go get a Starbucks?
Can I get a Starbucks?

1388
01:21:51.331 --> 01:21:52.230
If I went to New Guinea,

1389
01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:56.670
you can probably get some sort of pizza hut product.

1390
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:59.190
Wow.
I don't know about Starbuck.

1391
01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:02.910
I saw a giant coca cola billboard in the Yucatan.
I was like,

1392
01:22:02.911 --> 01:22:05.670
this is the nuttier Shit I've seen in my life driving into the jungle and the

1393
01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:09.990
weight of the Mayan Ruins and is a giant ad for sugar.
Water.
Oak is everywhere.

1394
01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:14.040
It's everywhere.
Everywhere you go,
it's actually everywhere you go.

1395
01:22:14.041 --> 01:22:18.000
Except for a lot of the Muslim world because they only drink Pepsi because

1396
01:22:18.001 --> 01:22:23.001
somebody spread a rumor that Coca Cola had sort of funded design as a movement.

1397
01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:27.810
Whoever did that as a marketing tool was fucking smart.
Just Pepsi.

1398
01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:33.630
What does that mean?
Hey,
easy,
easy,
easy,
easy,
easy.
What does that mean?
Design,
ISM,

1399
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:37.950
Zionism,
Zionism and sow and sow and sow.
Peptide.

1400
01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:42.710
Pepsin is designed ism.
And so Pepsi's now bigger in all these countries.

1401
01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:46.770
You're like,
cause I'm a coke fan.
I don't like Pepsi.
I bet you are.

1402
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:53.550
Where's the ice son?
Alright.
Um,
yeah,
take both soc.

1403
01:22:53.551 --> 01:22:57.040
Let's be honest.
I've been trying to drink water.
Larry bad.
You're,

1404
01:22:57.050 --> 01:22:59.550
you're a healthy guy.
I've been more healthy lately or helped the guy.

1405
01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:03.660
I'm gluten free for one week.
I'll beautiful try.
I eat,
I eat everything.

1406
01:23:03.661 --> 01:23:06.040
I'm a fucking,
I do too.
I do too.
But

1407
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:10.930
<v 2>I've been a the garbage I do too.
I don't know.
I'm,
when I say garbage,</v>

1408
01:23:10.931 --> 01:23:14.580
I mean I like street.
Meet me to,
you know,
any,

1409
01:23:14.650 --> 01:23:19.090
any place I can get a Kebab.
That's what I'm talking about,
dog.
I'll give it up.

1410
01:23:19.091 --> 01:23:23.860
I'll,
I'll,
I'll fold like a house of cards.
He burnt charred meat.
I'll eat it.

1411
01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:28.020
Yeah,
no,
I agree in that
strong.

1412
01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:33.340
I'm a fat.
I'll stop this.
I'm gray inside.
A great ashes.
Ashes,
wink,
wink.

1413
01:23:33.610 --> 01:23:35.050
She ashy gray,

1414
01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:38.860
horrible gray and fluid and pink and strong and bureau.

1415
01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:43.470
The guys get him.
Yeah,
this is getting gross.
Are Ready.

1416
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:48.030
Um,
I wanted to talk to you about,
there was some,
some article that who,

1417
01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:51.970
who got nasty with you lately.
It was a lot of people getting nasty.

1418
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:56.440
There was someone that said something about a,
you lying about your past.
Sure.

1419
01:23:56.530 --> 01:23:57.260
Yeah.
What was that all know all

1420
01:23:57.260 --> 01:24:02.190
<v 5>about?
You know,
it's interesting because when I was studying in,</v>

1421
01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.460
uh,

1422
01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:08.160
I studying political science about Paul and the first I was in first year

1423
01:24:08.161 --> 01:24:10.950
probably sign a guy goes to me,
he goes,
I was,

1424
01:24:10.970 --> 01:24:13.950
he was a southern guy even though he was in Canada.
And he goes,

1425
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:18.900
I was running a race and we were losing the race and we were fighting the

1426
01:24:18.901 --> 01:24:22.350
incumbent,
the governor.
And uh,

1427
01:24:22.351 --> 01:24:24.550
I said to my client,
uh,

1428
01:24:24.630 --> 01:24:29.280
we have to tell the people that he's having,
you know,

1429
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:34.540
Congo relations with farm animals and the,
you know,

1430
01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:39.030
the income is my vote.
Yeah.
Roger,
I let the guy goes,
you know,

1431
01:24:39.130 --> 01:24:42.240
the,
the young sort of idealists guy goes like,

1432
01:24:42.570 --> 01:24:46.740
I will not say that the governor of whatever it is,
Alabama is a,

1433
01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:50.790
has carnal knowledge.
It's fucking pigs.
You know,
I'm not going to do that.

1434
01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:53.820
I know him.
He's a good man.
Whenever he goes,
you know,
and by the way,

1435
01:24:53.821 --> 01:24:56.280
he doesn't do it.
Like we can't,
you know,

1436
01:24:56.770 --> 01:25:00.720
to impinge his character.
And,
and,
and the,

1437
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:04.680
the guy who was teaching me this political class goes,
you know,

1438
01:25:05.670 --> 01:25:08.550
all you've got to do is say he's a pig fucker.

1439
01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:12.420
Because then the minute he says,
I am not a pig fucker,

1440
01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:17.190
everyone will know that he is a pig fucker.
So the,

1441
01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:21.870
the interesting thing for me is that I'm just this dude like doing vice,

1442
01:25:21.871 --> 01:25:23.550
do my things,
do my documentaries.

1443
01:25:24.090 --> 01:25:26.490
And when we did the HBO show and it got bigger and bigger,

1444
01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:29.550
and then all of a sudden,
it's not just the far right,
it's the far left.

1445
01:25:29.551 --> 01:25:31.500
Everyone starts taking potshots cause like,
oh,

1446
01:25:31.501 --> 01:25:36.480
here's these guys and we're trying to make,
uh,
uh,
you know,

1447
01:25:36.630 --> 01:25:40.260
impartial fucking documentaries and try and do news and Shit.

1448
01:25:40.770 --> 01:25:45.180
And they start taking these potshots and it's a great question because my

1449
01:25:45.181 --> 01:25:46.650
initial reaction is like,

1450
01:25:47.670 --> 01:25:51.720
you're going to talk to my ex girlfriends off the record.
You know,

1451
01:25:51.721 --> 01:25:55.560
you're going to fucking go.
There was nobody speaking on the record.

1452
01:25:55.561 --> 01:25:56.760
You're going to fucking go,
whatever.

1453
01:25:56.761 --> 01:26:01.761
And then I realized I'm defending myself against Shit that's just total horse

1454
01:26:02.131 --> 01:26:03.620
shit.
So it was just a piece.

1455
01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:07.370
It's a total head piece and then I'm sitting there going,
okay,

1456
01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:09.950
that's how it starts.
Like,

1457
01:26:09.951 --> 01:26:13.280
cause we've had this discussion where you sit there and the the left sits there

1458
01:26:13.281 --> 01:26:17.360
and makes their comedy jokes about,
no,
you did this and you said this.

1459
01:26:17.361 --> 01:26:21.410
I'll Rodney in a rottie just as a fucking school yard bully and everybody's just

1460
01:26:21.411 --> 01:26:24.470
attacking,
attacking everybody else's character and all this shit.

1461
01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.010
When I said either I'm going to fucking go down there in the trenches and start

1462
01:26:28.011 --> 01:26:30.920
spewing shit and say,
no,
I didn't do this.
No,
I didn't do this.
No,

1463
01:26:30.921 --> 01:26:35.060
I did not fuck pigs or I'm just going to keep on fucking making the shit that

1464
01:26:35.061 --> 01:26:38.660
I'm making and I'm not going to fucking enter into the shit.
Is it true?
No.

1465
01:26:38.690 --> 01:26:43.220
Is it fucking a hit pcs from the fucking,
you know,
whatever.
But hold on.

1466
01:26:43.221 --> 01:26:46.580
I've had them from the right,
from the left,
from anybody.
Okay.
Little this,

1467
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:51.480
let's just be specific.
What are the accusations?
Well,
I've had a lot this,

1468
01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:55.190
there's several specific ones lately about your past,

1469
01:26:55.191 --> 01:26:59.110
about your journalist history.
Sure.
Well,
what did their shifts,
there's,
there's,

1470
01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:03.320
there's shit from like,
you know,
25 years ago.
And by the way,

1471
01:27:03.321 --> 01:27:07.640
I can't talk a lot about this because you know,
with these things,

1472
01:27:07.641 --> 01:27:11.570
it gets a bit legal.
Right?
I see what you're saying.
Um,

1473
01:27:11.630 --> 01:27:15.380
because a lot of it's just horse shit and you're like,
okay,
so we'll,

1474
01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:20.010
we'll look at that.
Um,
and I'm not actually going to get into know,

1475
01:27:20.011 --> 01:27:23.330
like the slinging of the shit and defending myself because that's what I said.

1476
01:27:23.331 --> 01:27:25.760
I'm just going to make my shit and do what I don't want you to express yourself

1477
01:27:25.761 --> 01:27:30.220
in any way that you're not comfortable with.
And the whole thing about,
you know,

1478
01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.790
whenever people discuss their past,

1479
01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:37.240
the idea that anybody has right to talk to you about your past at all to me is I

1480
01:27:38.451 --> 01:27:40.850
feel like if someone wants to talk to me about their past,

1481
01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.360
then they choose to do so.
But if they don't,

1482
01:27:43.370 --> 01:27:47.000
the idea you can pry into someone's past is completely ridiculous.

1483
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:52.070
I can or I cannot th th th the thing about it is,
uh,

1484
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:58.840
when somebody does something that's wrong,
then you can rectify that in a,

1485
01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:02.500
in an adult manner,
which is what we're doing.
Um,

1486
01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:06.590
what did we rectifying?
Yeah,
look,

1487
01:28:07.630 --> 01:28:10.800
you know,
again,
we're going to get into sort of legal shit,
right?
Okay.

1488
01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:15.740
But the reality of it is,
is that,
you know,
look,
am I perfect?

1489
01:28:16.130 --> 01:28:20.480
No,
you're beautiful.
Thank you.
So like a Whitney Houston Song?
No,

1490
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:23.150
it's not when he used to be,
by the way,
but by the way,

1491
01:28:23.630 --> 01:28:27.300
I don't want it matter what they say and do.
I do.
I drank too much to anyone.
No,

1492
01:28:27.310 --> 01:28:30.260
no,
no.
He drank the exact amount.
You,
but,
but it's perfect.

1493
01:28:30.261 --> 01:28:33.740
But if I made a conscious decision about this,

1494
01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:36.560
if somebody's talking shit,

1495
01:28:36.970 --> 01:28:40.190
I'll let fucking lawyers and other people deal with that and I'm going to

1496
01:28:40.191 --> 01:28:45.191
fucking make my shit because what I'm not going to do is get into this laugh he

1497
01:28:45.361 --> 01:28:49.250
site,
she said,
political,
I fucking attack you.
You attack me.

1498
01:28:49.251 --> 01:28:51.950
Then we attack each other and no one's making the fucking news.

1499
01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.280
And I'm going to do is I'm going to make the fucking news and do the stories

1500
01:28:55.281 --> 01:28:58.040
that I want to do.
If people want to fucking attack me,

1501
01:28:58.070 --> 01:29:00.440
they can fucking attack me.
And by the way,

1502
01:29:00.441 --> 01:29:03.720
if they want to about my girlfriend's off the fucking record,

1503
01:29:03.721 --> 01:29:06.300
if they want to talk about shit from fucking whatever,
right?

1504
01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:11.340
If they want to get like x employees that fucking never speak on the record,

1505
01:29:11.370 --> 01:29:14.610
it's a whole fun.
So if I could encapsulate it,

1506
01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:19.740
what will you basically saying is it's all bullshit and to talk about it sort of

1507
01:29:20.581 --> 01:29:25.581
like it's what they're trying to do is they see that there's a lot of energy and

1508
01:29:25.951 --> 01:29:29.730
a lot of a lot of attention eyes on this whole vice thing.

1509
01:29:29.731 --> 01:29:32.850
Whether it's your HBO show,
whether it's the web,
the web,

1510
01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:37.530
there's a lot of energy going on and for anybody not to be,

1511
01:29:37.650 --> 01:29:39.150
this is my personal opinion of course,

1512
01:29:39.151 --> 01:29:43.260
but not to be appreciative of all the content that you guys put out.

1513
01:29:43.530 --> 01:29:46.770
There's so much interesting shit from Hamilton Morris stuff.

1514
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:50.460
Hamilton Mars stuff is brilliant.
I love that guy.
He's a weird guy.

1515
01:29:50.461 --> 01:29:52.770
On the podcast because vice vice does a lot of stuff.

1516
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:56.160
The one thing is is I'm the face,
I'm the face of vice a.

1517
01:29:56.240 --> 01:30:00.360
So people on both sides are going to come after me.
Fine.
And I'm,
by the way,

1518
01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:04.840
like I said,
if you want to avoid criticism,
don't go anywhere.
Don't meet anyone.

1519
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:06.150
Don't say anything.
Okay?

1520
01:30:06.210 --> 01:30:09.000
So my whole thing is we're going to go out there and make our shit.

1521
01:30:09.150 --> 01:30:13.440
Are people going to have goes at us on both sides of the fucking spectrum?
Yes.

1522
01:30:14.010 --> 01:30:15.570
Am I going to fucking get down there?

1523
01:30:15.571 --> 01:30:19.410
And every time someone says your girlfriend said you didn't fucking whack off,

1524
01:30:19.411 --> 01:30:22.920
right?
No,
I don't give a fuck.
So they can fuck off.
Yeah.

1525
01:30:22.921 --> 01:30:26.310
Girls are wanting to talk about the way you whack off ex-girlfriend.

1526
01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:28.700
Dare you ladies.
By the way,

1527
01:30:31.350 --> 01:30:31.861
by the way,

1528
01:30:31.861 --> 01:30:34.830
you have to look at the source and if you're going to sit there and say,
okay,

1529
01:30:35.130 --> 01:30:38.910
I'm going to go to some dude's ex girlfriends from 20 fucking years ago,
friends,

1530
01:30:38.911 --> 01:30:39.181
you know,

1531
01:30:39.181 --> 01:30:42.130
if you're a girl and you got to deal with some Douche bag dude from your past,

1532
01:30:42.131 --> 01:30:46.520
it makes up shit about you.
That's gotta suck too.
Cause it's like human beings.

1533
01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:49.080
It's like when,
when he had,
we had baron on yesterday,

1534
01:30:49.081 --> 01:30:53.070
he was talking about his divorce and the insanity of a person that used to love

1535
01:30:53.071 --> 01:30:56.880
try and take everything you have is your house.
And it was fascinating.

1536
01:30:56.910 --> 01:31:01.360
Absolutely fucking fascinating.
But that's humans,
man.
That's what I,

1537
01:31:01.361 --> 01:31:05.010
what I find interesting about America right now is anyone that comes up trying

1538
01:31:05.011 --> 01:31:07.530
to say,
look,
you know what?
We're going to try to do something.

1539
01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:08.820
We're going to try to do something different.

1540
01:31:08.821 --> 01:31:12.360
We're going to stay away from the fucking regular way to most fucking people are

1541
01:31:12.361 --> 01:31:14.220
doing this shit because it hasn't worked.

1542
01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:17.880
They just have a go at you and you're like,

1543
01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:21.420
I'm just trying to fucking do my shit,
dude.
Like you're having a go at me like,

1544
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:24.540
well,
and by the way,
I've got to say,
I've got to say,
if that's your best,

1545
01:31:24.541 --> 01:31:27.900
go at me then.
So there's nothing,
no merit to it.

1546
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:29.670
We were saying it's just no merit.
Okay.

1547
01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:33.570
So all the things they're saying you did or didn't do,
you actually did do.

1548
01:31:33.571 --> 01:31:36.880
And all the things they're saying,
look,
again,
it's going to get into legal.

1549
01:31:37.140 --> 01:31:41.820
I understand what you're saying,
but,
but the,
uh,
so it's a hit job.

1550
01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:42.661
Exactly.

1551
01:31:42.661 --> 01:31:45.930
So they're trying to find some flaw in your character and they're going to the

1552
01:31:45.950 --> 01:31:47.760
for what,
what do you do when they don't want,

1553
01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:51.090
they don't want you to say shit and they say,
okay,
whatever,
you know,
well,

1554
01:31:51.091 --> 01:31:53.930
you have to be like me and have zero credibility is the best.

1555
01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:56.550
The other thing that's interesting is I've always said,
look,

1556
01:31:56.551 --> 01:32:00.610
if you're looking at advice for everything,
then we're at to begin with,
because,

1557
01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:05.110
you know,
we used to,
as you pointed out,
we used to be this and that.
However,
look,

1558
01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.790
have we evolved?
Have we done shit?

1559
01:32:06.791 --> 01:32:10.090
Have we gone from talking about sneakers to news?
Yeah.
And by the way,

1560
01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:13.610
if you go back in my life,
have I done drugs have been a bad boy.
Right?

1561
01:32:14.650 --> 01:32:18.460
What the fuck?
What are you doing promoting drug use?

1562
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:23.080
Not On my show.
Not,
I'm not sure if this is America as my America.

1563
01:32:23.081 --> 01:32:26.810
You're Canadian.
You don't even American.
Goddammit.
We're all competent together.

1564
01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:30.040
We're all congress in a certain way.
Right.
In a certain way.
Right.

1565
01:32:30.490 --> 01:32:33.550
I mean socialists not really little medicine wise.

1566
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:36.250
They're just a rich country so they can spread some money around.

1567
01:32:37.690 --> 01:32:38.381
I was just going to ask you,

1568
01:32:38.381 --> 01:32:42.190
why are they so rich and is it like a fake false of like are they going to have

1569
01:32:42.191 --> 01:32:44.630
a boom with her like finance or real estate?

1570
01:32:45.190 --> 01:32:49.600
This is what it is is because they're not cunts and they didn't get robbed.
Okay.

1571
01:32:49.601 --> 01:32:51.250
They had a totally different country.

1572
01:32:51.370 --> 01:32:54.060
It's a big country with not that many people.

1573
01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:57.400
Harder to fuck everybody over and they didn't have the home mortgage crisis that

1574
01:32:57.401 --> 01:33:00.310
we had.
Yeah.
And also,
I mean it's,
you know,

1575
01:33:00.370 --> 01:33:03.880
there's so much resource welt up there as well as banking,

1576
01:33:03.881 --> 01:33:05.650
as well as tech as well as everything else.

1577
01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:09.190
But they have just a lot of resources and not a lot of people.
Yeah.

1578
01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:12.730
And they're friendlier.
Yeah.
That helps too.

1579
01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:16.990
That helps people are the same,
pretty much the most.
You're out of your mind.

1580
01:33:16.991 --> 01:33:18.520
You can feel it.
I don't agree with that.

1581
01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:21.550
I think there's a lot of friendly people in this country is Canadians can be

1582
01:33:21.730 --> 01:33:26.270
pretty hypocritical
backwards.
No.
Well,

1583
01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:30.070
what I will say is there a little bit hypocritical because they'll say we're not

1584
01:33:30.071 --> 01:33:34.390
American.
You know,
we give out foreign aid.

1585
01:33:34.391 --> 01:33:37.930
We're nicer,
we're better.
We're kinder,
but an actual fact,

1586
01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:42.920
it's a bunch of Hokum.
And,
and how do you disrespect?
Like what,
what,

1587
01:33:42.921 --> 01:33:46.870
what is,
uh,
what's come about it?
Well,
like we give out four and eight for sure,

1588
01:33:46.871 --> 01:33:51.710
but we,
a lot of the times we were giving it to the bad guys.
You know,
who,

1589
01:33:51.711 --> 01:33:55.300
who were running these different countries.
We gave out,
for example,

1590
01:33:55.301 --> 01:33:59.050
candy reactors.
And we said,
hey,
by the way,
nobody used this,

1591
01:33:59.051 --> 01:34:03.280
a radioactive plutonium that comes out of here for any other things,
you know,

1592
01:34:03.730 --> 01:34:08.380
and,
and also when,
so they gave it away.
They gave,
they gave,
they gave candy rack,

1593
01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:13.360
reactor technology away to why I believe Pakistan and India right now,

1594
01:34:13.361 --> 01:34:17.350
which is John.
So Kathy,
I think Pakistan and India,
their nukes,

1595
01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:21.390
I believe Pakistan through uh,

1596
01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:26.700
a que con and France and some of North Korea a weaponized it.

1597
01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:31.030
But I believe that the initial,
um,

1598
01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:35.950
reactors both from India,
I'm for sure India,
but I'm pretty sure it,

1599
01:34:35.951 --> 01:34:39.760
Pakistan came from Canada.
She's Christ.
But in any case,

1600
01:34:40.230 --> 01:34:41.980
the reason why I say that,
it's just because we're like,

1601
01:34:41.981 --> 01:34:45.190
we're like holding a little bit holier than that.
We're like,
well,
you know,

1602
01:34:45.220 --> 01:34:48.460
we're nicer.
We're richer.
We have universal healthcare.
We have,

1603
01:34:49.010 --> 01:34:52.480
let's look at that.
Because look at that decision.
That decision was only made by,

1604
01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:53.440
I mean how many people,

1605
01:34:53.441 --> 01:34:56.710
how many people were involved in the decision to sell arms to other countries.

1606
01:34:56.860 --> 01:34:59.170
It's probably a very small cell.
Give.
Okay.

1607
01:34:59.180 --> 01:35:01.940
Give even getting w w there was some influence.
There's something,

1608
01:35:01.941 --> 01:35:03.050
something in exchange.

1609
01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:08.980
I think Canada is the largest donator of foreign aid per capita in the world.

1610
01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:12.740
That's our,
that's our big thing.
Just giving people money,
owing people money,

1611
01:35:13.370 --> 01:35:15.380
whatever you do with it,
fine,
but do it.
No,

1612
01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:19.060
but there's a lot of sanctimonious sort of like,
we're great,
we're nice,

1613
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:22.760
we're cool.
You know,
we don't fuck with anybody where everybody likes us.

1614
01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:25.760
Some of my favorite people that ever met a Canadian,
but you know,

1615
01:35:25.761 --> 01:35:30.470
at the same time,
you know,
it's,
it's,
you know,
we say,

1616
01:35:30.471 --> 01:35:32.960
okay,
you know,
we have this great education system,

1617
01:35:32.961 --> 01:35:35.240
we have this great healthcare system,
but it's a two tiered system.

1618
01:35:35.241 --> 01:35:39.980
Nobody admits it,
but it is,
you know,
it cuts off the tall trees.
It May,

1619
01:35:39.981 --> 01:35:43.820
it may be a two tiered system,
but it's so much better for the lower tier.

1620
01:35:44.210 --> 01:35:46.680
Correct.
Then the system that it's in America.
Yeah.

1621
01:35:46.730 --> 01:35:49.930
I think you're going to hear it.
But America system is fun.
Sane.
It's,
you know,

1622
01:35:49.931 --> 01:35:52.610
it's just fun.
It's fun.
It's chaos.

1623
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:56.240
You should do a special about if the hundred dollar bill in Canada actually

1624
01:35:56.241 --> 01:36:00.330
really is purposely smells like maple syrup or if it's just box.

1625
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:05.450
I never did.
You know that I knew,
I knew one of the bills melted the new,

1626
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.850
the new,

1627
01:36:05.850 --> 01:36:10.850
the new currency is made out of plastic and it melts or in the dryer but it's

1628
01:36:11.181 --> 01:36:15.110
really hot.
But the hundred dollar bill smells like maple syrup like,

1629
01:36:15.111 --> 01:36:17.810
and it really,
why would she have money that melts in the dryer?

1630
01:36:17.811 --> 01:36:19.940
That's fucking stupid.
You can't rip it though.

1631
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:23.790
You tried to rip it and can't rip it.
But if it melts that dryer,
who,

1632
01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:26.360
what's more likely that you're gonna Rip Your Shit?

1633
01:36:26.361 --> 01:36:29.370
Are you going to leave it in your pocket?
I don't know.
I will say one thing,

1634
01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:34.140
a lot of times I'd take out a bills and I give them to people in foreign

1635
01:36:34.141 --> 01:36:39.141
countries and America money looks counterfeit cause like the faces will be all

1636
01:36:39.391 --> 01:36:43.440
blurred and shit so shitty to,
and it'll be all like,

1637
01:36:44.130 --> 01:36:44.461
you know,

1638
01:36:44.461 --> 01:36:48.150
you hand over like a hundred analogue and in Thailand or China and they're like

1639
01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:49.950
that's not real.
Yeah.

1640
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:54.220
Cause like the whole thing is like wiped out and faded shitty.
Yeah.

1641
01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:58.170
And you're like,
that can't be real honey.
She's had like their money,

1642
01:36:58.171 --> 01:37:01.990
like I was at pink diet and they have this wall of like every single like

1643
01:37:02.130 --> 01:37:04.050
currency they've ever got from every single country.

1644
01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:07.010
And there's some like currency that's like really baby looks like a little

1645
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:11.610
monopoly money.
Cute.
I don't know.
It's,
there's a lot of countries that have that.

1646
01:37:11.611 --> 01:37:14.880
Canada has dope money.
They have like little windows clear windows.

1647
01:37:16.690 --> 01:37:20.350
You fuckers shit.
No I don't.
Oh I do.

1648
01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:26.050
This is my favorite.
Somebody gave this to me recently and they're like,
here,

1649
01:37:26.110 --> 01:37:30.940
this is when shit gets out of hand.
Uh Oh yeah,
there you go.
That's real.

1650
01:37:30.970 --> 01:37:34.090
That's real money.
What is this for?
What countries?
Zimbabwe.

1651
01:37:34.670 --> 01:37:37.980
$50 billion.
Oh yeah,
that's real.
It's a,
it's like a dog.

1652
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.640
It's like 17 cents or something like that.
50 billion.

1653
01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:47.000
$50 billion.
This is $50 billion.
That's 50 billion.

1654
01:37:47.150 --> 01:37:51.330
Turn the camera on.
That is it.
There you go.
That's $50 billion inc.

1655
01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:53.240
That's real though.
This is what's weird.

1656
01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:58.230
She just told about that same exact bill last night.
She's like,
check this out.

1657
01:37:58.231 --> 01:38:01.960
And she showed you now have a 1 trillion.
I'm 50 billion now.
It's like one trip.

1658
01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:06.240
So what's the exchange rate?
Wayne have that,
what's the exchange rate?

1659
01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:10.410
What's that worth?
17 cents or something like that.

1660
01:38:10.411 --> 01:38:12.240
She said you're look it up.
No Way.

1661
01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:16.860
Louis Billion Zimbabwe in dollars versus an American dollar.

1662
01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:18.880
What's the exchange rate for

1663
01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:25.380
dollars in Zimbabwe?
[inaudible] Zimbabwe dollars versus the United States.

1664
01:38:25.770 --> 01:38:26.220
That's

1665
01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:27.053
<v 2>pretty good.</v>

1666
01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:31.830
<v 5>And also I'd like to graphic,
I'd like to,</v>

1667
01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:36.020
I'd like to graphic to be a little bit better than a rock.
It looks like poop.

1668
01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:40.700
It's just,
you know,
it looks like a dog just took a Doodoo of dollars.

1669
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:41.870
33 cents.

1670
01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:46.580
<v 2>No,
well no,
no.
$50 billion.
It's 33 cents.</v>

1671
01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:51.110
Yep.
Well,
I guess there's been a little declining economy.

1672
01:38:51.111 --> 01:38:53.420
Don't worry about it folks.
I could never happen in the air.

1673
01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:56.810
It's not like we're all just human.
Wow.
John,
worry about it.

1674
01:38:56.811 --> 01:39:01.811
Could you imagine a $50 billion for 33 cents then my whole farming fishing idea,

1675
01:39:03.110 --> 01:39:06.670
making a lot of sense.
What's your from Matthew?

1676
01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:10.110
<v 5>How much does that money cost though to make it has to be more,</v>

1677
01:39:10.170 --> 01:39:11.850
it's gotta be cost more than 13 cents.

1678
01:39:11.950 --> 01:39:14.720
<v 2>No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
When no one gets paid and everyone eats rice,</v>

1679
01:39:14.721 --> 01:39:18.940
she can get people to pinch it up pretty cheap.
Yeah,
trust me.
All right,

1680
01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.710
well that the 13th census,
it's insane.
I mean,
what we just,

1681
01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:26.570
it's like,
it's a Coen brothers movie.
It's,

1682
01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:30.040
it's a Cohen brothers movie about a country somewhere in the world where

1683
01:39:30.041 --> 01:39:33.730
everything's collapsing and these are human beings and they coexist with people

1684
01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:38.910
that have a Samsung Galaxy s four that can survive 10 feet underwater for like

1685
01:39:40.450 --> 01:39:41.283
an hour.

1686
01:39:41.930 --> 01:39:46.360
<v 5>Everyone's living in the same time.
It's crazy.
It's true.
But how do you also,</v>

1687
01:39:46.361 --> 01:39:49.850
how do you,
like,
you have to go with a,

1688
01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:53.470
like a wheelbarrow full of cash to buy like Brighton

1689
01:39:53.850 --> 01:39:56.700
<v 2>can of corn.
Well,
that's what we always heard about the downfall,</v>

1690
01:39:56.701 --> 01:39:57.720
the Soviet Union.

1691
01:39:58.530 --> 01:40:01.410
Do you remember that they would talk about lines for potatoes and stuff,

1692
01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:04.190
whether or not,
I mean,
I,
I don't,
I'm not,
you know,

1693
01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:07.230
obviously I really don't know what happened.
I wasn't there,
I didn't see it,

1694
01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:10.410
but I can't assume that those stories were bullshit.

1695
01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:13.500
I bet people really food for us.

1696
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:17.100
It's really hard for us to wrap our head around the idea that society can fall

1697
01:40:17.101 --> 01:40:20.850
apart like that because we,
we haven't seen in her lifetime go to a supermarket.

1698
01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:23.820
You go to the supermarket here,
he's like,
fuck,
we got everything.

1699
01:40:24.170 --> 01:40:27.150
It's the history of the world though.
His shit falling apart.
Yes.

1700
01:40:27.210 --> 01:40:30.630
They hit the history of the world and shit falling apart and people figuring out

1701
01:40:30.631 --> 01:40:34.470
new and innovative ways to stop it from happening again.

1702
01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:37.470
And then that works for a little while and then their grandchildren getting

1703
01:40:37.471 --> 01:40:39.000
charged and then it all falls apart again.

1704
01:40:39.001 --> 01:40:44.001
And then it keeps going on with a cry for revolution can be just switched up

1705
01:40:44.581 --> 01:40:49.020
with the cry for bread.
Yes,
we're fucking hungry.
That's fucking fight.

1706
01:40:49.050 --> 01:40:51.510
Or for books.
I mean,
you know,

1707
01:40:51.511 --> 01:40:54.190
they were trying to stop people from having you know that.

1708
01:40:55.320 --> 01:40:59.410
<v 0>Well,
I wouldn't reading this thing about Martin Luther and the idea of,</v>

1709
01:40:59.770 --> 01:41:04.330
I'm a huge fan of a Dan Carlin's podcast.
Hardcore history,
right.

1710
01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:07.750
I talk about on the show all the time.
And one of the things I talked about is,

1711
01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:08.830
uh,
that I,
uh,

1712
01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:12.970
listened to recently rather cause he's got this whole thing about Lutherism and

1713
01:41:12.971 --> 01:41:17.410
about Martin Luther being the first guy to translate the Bible phonetically in a

1714
01:41:17.411 --> 01:41:18.880
way that people can understand.

1715
01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:22.750
And that before that the Bible was only in Latin and most poor people had no

1716
01:41:22.751 --> 01:41:25.270
idea what it said.
They didn't understand the words of the Bible.

1717
01:41:25.450 --> 01:41:28.870
And this became like this crazy heresy that this guy had done this given the

1718
01:41:28.871 --> 01:41:32.020
Bible is all these people.
And it's when you,

1719
01:41:32.021 --> 01:41:35.050
when you hear about shit like that and you realize that this is just sort of

1720
01:41:35.051 --> 01:41:38.950
always been going on,
is this control and this,
this,

1721
01:41:38.951 --> 01:41:43.951
this thing that we see today with the NSA and with the idea of drones.

1722
01:41:44.021 --> 01:41:46.300
And the idea is that,
you know,
that we look,

1723
01:41:46.301 --> 01:41:49.930
we got to check your everybody's email because one of you might be a terrorist.

1724
01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:54.280
You almost want to stop and put your hand over your heart and go,
oh my God,
dude.

1725
01:41:54.281 --> 01:41:56.740
You hear what you're saying?
Like you're a movie.

1726
01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:58.600
You're a character in a Coen brothers movie,

1727
01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:04.170
you're the most evil and ridiculous of dictators ever in the most prosperous of

1728
01:42:04.751 --> 01:42:07.480
time.
But that's where the vanity is.
There is like,

1729
01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:11.980
do people have moments of sanity and realize what they're doing?

1730
01:42:12.030 --> 01:42:16.850
<v 5>Yeah,
because like if you ever like,
you know,
for example,
Libya,
you know,</v>

1731
01:42:16.851 --> 01:42:19.380
you're like Gaddafi started as a man of the people.

1732
01:42:19.381 --> 01:42:23.160
He started a revolution and then all of a sudden you've got these mercenaries

1733
01:42:23.161 --> 01:42:25.800
killing your own people and Shit and you're like,
do you ever wake up?

1734
01:42:25.801 --> 01:42:29.040
You're sitting on the can and do you ever say,
Hey,
I'm killing my own people.

1735
01:42:29.041 --> 01:42:33.720
Same thing now in,
in,
in um,
in Syria,
like usually shooting there,

1736
01:42:33.721 --> 01:42:37.110
you're trying to hold on to power and you're like,
okay,
we fucked shit up.

1737
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:39.570
Hundreds of thousands of people are getting fucked up.
You know,

1738
01:42:39.571 --> 01:42:43.350
tens of thousands of people is getting killed.
Like,
these are my people.

1739
01:42:43.351 --> 01:42:46.740
I'm supposed to be like a progressive.
He was educated at Oxford.

1740
01:42:46.741 --> 01:42:50.810
He must at some point know what the fuck he's would imagine.
You would imagine.

1741
01:42:50.910 --> 01:42:55.910
<v 0>I have to call bullshit on my own self because me saying that like that anyone</v>

1742
01:42:56.040 --> 01:43:00.270
at any point in time is like the,
the,
like you'll go back to Hitler.

1743
01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:04.620
Hitler at one time it was like the most evil controlling,

1744
01:43:04.621 --> 01:43:08.460
dominant dictator in history.
But that's just because that's where he lived.

1745
01:43:08.461 --> 01:43:12.030
Like he was in.
He was in that time.
He was dealing with the past.

1746
01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:14.400
But if you stop and look at numbers,

1747
01:43:14.610 --> 01:43:16.770
look at the overall numbers of humans killed.

1748
01:43:16.771 --> 01:43:20.220
It's like there's always some new thing.
There's always some new focus,

1749
01:43:20.221 --> 01:43:24.180
point of energy and destruction.
Whether you go back to the Mongols,

1750
01:43:24.181 --> 01:43:25.470
you go to Hitler,
you go to,

1751
01:43:25.710 --> 01:43:30.150
what you're dealing with is a human characteristic that embodies itself in a

1752
01:43:30.151 --> 01:43:34.980
charismatic and enigmatic figure.
Yeah.
But it's a human characteristic.
This,
this,

1753
01:43:35.010 --> 01:43:39.030
this want and need for destruction is doing things that you're terrified of

1754
01:43:39.031 --> 01:43:42.580
having done,
done to you.
It's almost,
it's,
it's a,

1755
01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:45.370
it's almost an unavoidable human characteristics and it's,

1756
01:43:45.590 --> 01:43:50.100
it's incredibly fascinating to me.
It's incredibly fascinating to me.

1757
01:43:50.130 --> 01:43:52.080
Just if was,
uh,
it was,
uh,

1758
01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:56.000
an alien watching us from another planet trying to figure out what's going on

1759
01:43:56.001 --> 01:43:58.780
with people,
that would be an incredibly fascinating aspect of it.

1760
01:43:58.990 --> 01:44:03.700
<v 5>Well,
what I,
what I find interesting,
two things.
One is,
uh,</v>

1761
01:44:03.790 --> 01:44:08.580
you look at that time,
let's say the 30s,
forties,
50s,
and you say,
okay,

1762
01:44:08.710 --> 01:44:10.630
Hitler killed all these people,
very bad guy.

1763
01:44:11.050 --> 01:44:13.900
Stalin killed twice as many as Hitler,
very,

1764
01:44:13.901 --> 01:44:18.310
very bad guy and Mao killed three times as many in his own country.

1765
01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:22.690
And then at that point you're like,
what the fuck was going on back then?
A B.

1766
01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:27.430
My second point is when you look at,
uh,
like shit,

1767
01:44:27.610 --> 01:44:32.470
like what's happening now?
And you say,
okay,
how does that actually happen?

1768
01:44:32.830 --> 01:44:37.420
You know,
like how do we get to that point?
And what happens is,
you know,

1769
01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:41.560
you sit there and you say,
okay,
you know,
I went to school and I learned this,

1770
01:44:41.561 --> 01:44:42.394
I learned this,

1771
01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:46.540
but you get cavalier and this is all these guys and the NSA or CIA or whatever.

1772
01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:50.500
Like,
you know what is like doctors,
you know,
doctors are sort of like,

1773
01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:53.620
oh well I deal with livers everyday.
So I lik lift up the liver,

1774
01:44:53.621 --> 01:44:54.640
I take out the fucking thing,

1775
01:44:54.641 --> 01:44:57.880
it put it down and they're kind of cavalier about the livers cops or cavalier

1776
01:44:57.881 --> 01:45:00.070
about the mafia.
Everyone's cavalier about the shit.

1777
01:45:00.970 --> 01:45:02.920
What happens in the NSA is like,
yeah,

1778
01:45:02.921 --> 01:45:05.980
we're listening to the guys of course were listening to the guys because fucking

1779
01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:07.390
we're listening to the guys and you're like,
yeah,

1780
01:45:07.391 --> 01:45:10.480
but you're fucking up everything.
Democracy,
freedom,

1781
01:45:10.510 --> 01:45:15.070
fucking private fucking shit life everything.
Yeah,
yeah.
But fucking,
you know,

1782
01:45:15.071 --> 01:45:18.190
we got,
we got to listen to these guys to get our shit done.

1783
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:22.390
And once you just become cavalier about shit and to go back to it,
it's like,

1784
01:45:22.391 --> 01:45:25.060
okay,
these people aren't,
you know,

1785
01:45:25.150 --> 01:45:28.210
part of the revolution or they're not part of the thing they've got to be done

1786
01:45:28.211 --> 01:45:28.810
away with.

1787
01:45:28.810 --> 01:45:33.100
That's the problem is when you take the humanity out of Shit and when you take

1788
01:45:33.101 --> 01:45:35.230
and it's just like your day in day out job,
it's like,

1789
01:45:35.231 --> 01:45:37.360
oh I got to make the donuts or fry the eggs or whatever.

1790
01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:39.320
<v 0>That's the problem with running a corporation.</v>

1791
01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:41.360
When you're dealing with the bottom line all the time.

1792
01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:45.020
That's the number one complaint that people have bought corporations is that

1793
01:45:45.021 --> 01:45:48.890
they remove humanity there.
Remove the repercussions for doing things.

1794
01:45:48.891 --> 01:45:53.150
The environment there removed the repercussions for influencing politicians are

1795
01:45:53.151 --> 01:45:55.030
the restrictions for influencing politicians

1796
01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:59.040
<v 5>and if a government is,
what is it,
you know,
one fifth of the,</v>

1797
01:45:59.041 --> 01:46:04.020
of the population,
then it becomes standard operating procedure.

1798
01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:08.630
<v 0>Yeah,
absolutely.
And I believe it's not only do I think it's not healthy,</v>

1799
01:46:08.631 --> 01:46:10.960
it doesn't have to happen that way.
Like I don't,

1800
01:46:10.970 --> 01:46:15.970
I don't think that there's something wrong with capitalism and competition

1801
01:46:16.221 --> 01:46:19.430
because I think that that fuels people and I think everybody looks at it in

1802
01:46:19.431 --> 01:46:22.220
terms of like competition is bad and those are your enemies.
No,

1803
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:24.790
I think it fuels you to do better for,

1804
01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:29.030
I think there's nothing wrong with being in competition with other companies,

1805
01:46:29.031 --> 01:46:33.500
but we try communism glacier,
we try communism.
It didn't work well with this.

1806
01:46:33.501 --> 01:46:37.700
Capitalism works or even if it doesn't work,
it's it.
It's a system.

1807
01:46:37.790 --> 01:46:41.900
It can be,
I think there could be,
it is,
there can be a moral capitalism and a,

1808
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:46.480
a moral,
ethical,
honorable capitalism.
But I'm just saying capitalism one.
Yeah.

1809
01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:50.010
Between,
you know,
gold war between communism and not perfect,
but

1810
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:54.740
<v 5>it makes the most sense.
And it's just one is,
it is.
Yeah.
The,
the,
the,</v>

1811
01:46:55.080 --> 01:46:55.913
the dominance.

1812
01:46:56.160 --> 01:47:00.180
You can't just expect people to work.

1813
01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:02.940
If you force them into a job,
you can't,

1814
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:07.110
you're stifling creativity or you're stunting progression,

1815
01:47:07.111 --> 01:47:09.450
you're fucking up the whole cycle of humanity.

1816
01:47:09.451 --> 01:47:13.360
You can't do it if you take out incentive.
Yes.
It's not going to,

1817
01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:17.280
well that's a huge problem.
Like there's,
I am,
I'm not a,

1818
01:47:17.281 --> 01:47:20.730
I'm not really a right wing guy and I'm not a left wing guy,

1819
01:47:20.890 --> 01:47:24.090
but there's a lot of like really insensitive shit that gets said about people

1820
01:47:24.091 --> 01:47:27.690
that go on welfare,
you know?
And like the idea is that you,
oh,

1821
01:47:27.691 --> 01:47:31.260
they become lazy and they don't do shit and they just want to fucking lay around

1822
01:47:31.261 --> 01:47:36.030
and get their check.
Like maybe,
but that's not the way to handle it.

1823
01:47:36.031 --> 01:47:38.080
For humans like you,

1824
01:47:38.081 --> 01:47:42.300
you can't help people that went to Prague can't just give them money like that.

1825
01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:45.120
The problem is is if you look at history,

1826
01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:50.480
there's always pretty much around 10% of the population that just doesn't fit

1827
01:47:50.941 --> 01:47:54.390
in.
Like it just,
there's a different system.
It could be communism,

1828
01:47:54.391 --> 01:47:56.460
could be capitalism,
it could be whatever,

1829
01:47:57.090 --> 01:48:01.900
but they just can't get the shit together to work within that system and wash

1830
01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:03.140
his heart.
Yeah.

1831
01:48:03.190 --> 01:48:07.900
She didn't charted and washes 10% of the fucking people that just aren't going

1832
01:48:07.901 --> 01:48:12.180
to get there.
It could be agrarian,
could be industrial,
it could be political,

1833
01:48:12.181 --> 01:48:15.810
could be anything.
It was just going to be 10% that just can't get there.

1834
01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:16.651
They just don't get it.

1835
01:48:16.651 --> 01:48:19.140
They can't fill out the forms that can't fucking whatever the fuck.

1836
01:48:19.940 --> 01:48:23.400
So when they have to do they have to find a better gig?
Well,
I'm,

1837
01:48:23.430 --> 01:48:25.170
I think it's part of the human equation.

1838
01:48:25.500 --> 01:48:30.090
Just need people there for some reason.
I don't know why,

1839
01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:33.600
but part of the human equation is there's just always going to be 10% of the

1840
01:48:33.601 --> 01:48:36.420
people you got to go.
I give to the fucking,
I dunno,

1841
01:48:36.450 --> 01:48:38.610
church as a soup kitchen or whatever.
They're like,
just,

1842
01:48:38.660 --> 01:48:40.770
they're not going to get there.
They're just not going to get there.

1843
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:45.600
And is that just the broad spectrum of biology in of itself?

1844
01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:52.020
I think Trey by the waterhole.
Thanks.
So I think it's literally just like,

1845
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:57.070
there's always 10% of the people for better,
for worse.
I don't know why.
I don't,

1846
01:48:57.130 --> 01:48:59.180
I don't like,
but it's fucked up.

1847
01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:03.770
It's a self fulfilling prophecy to fuck that.
Once you get locked into a,

1848
01:49:03.771 --> 01:49:06.600
a system of poverty to get out,
it's very difficult.

1849
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:09.320
It's hard to see the way out target,
you know?

1850
01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:11.760
Even though you see prosperity in front of you,

1851
01:49:11.761 --> 01:49:15.420
it's hard to see like our logical way to achieve that for yourself.
I came up,

1852
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:19.110
you know,
in Montreal,
which is the most sort of anticapitalist city in the world.

1853
01:49:19.111 --> 01:49:23.980
And Really?
Yeah.
Anticapitalist and we'll wear,
I don't know much.
Look,

1854
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.300
all I know about Montreal is,
it's beautiful and it's awesome.
Yeah,

1855
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:27.550
it's beautiful.
It's awesome being there.

1856
01:49:27.610 --> 01:49:31.450
It's literally one of the best cities in the fucking shout out to Joe beef.

1857
01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:37.890
Uh,
but they like,
they,
it's just,
it's a weird,
you know,

1858
01:49:38.220 --> 01:49:40.830
artistic community where community,

1859
01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:45.380
they want to separate from Canada or they did,
um,
it just,
it,

1860
01:49:45.381 --> 01:49:50.290
it was like they didn't give a fuck about just success like Toronto so much or I

1861
01:49:50.291 --> 01:49:52.870
was richer and bigger and more powerful than Toronto.

1862
01:49:53.290 --> 01:49:56.170
And then at some point Toronto said,
yeah,
we're going to be like New York.

1863
01:49:56.171 --> 01:49:59.110
And Montreal said,
we're just going to fucking do our own thing so much.

1864
01:49:59.111 --> 01:50:02.950
You're all became like its own weird,
you know,
beautiful,

1865
01:50:02.951 --> 01:50:07.870
crazy place in Toronto became a wanting to be in New York.
So,
you know,

1866
01:50:07.900 --> 01:50:11.650
it's,
it's,
when I say anticapitalist it's like for example,
bands like

1867
01:50:13.300 --> 01:50:16.450
Godspeed you black emperor or a arcade fire,
they're like,

1868
01:50:16.451 --> 01:50:18.710
we're not going to go on major labels.
Like you know,

1869
01:50:18.970 --> 01:50:20.980
all kinds of people are like,
we don't care about money.

1870
01:50:22.770 --> 01:50:26.850
Well that's a good question.
I mean,
arcade fire,
RK fires,

1871
01:50:27.130 --> 01:50:32.020
one of the biggest bands as well.
[inaudible] camper is like more uh,
you know,

1872
01:50:32.021 --> 01:50:36.400
uh,
or,
or Kestrel cool orchestral shit.

1873
01:50:36.630 --> 01:50:41.200
I'll try some of that business.
So who's one of the biggest bands in the world?

1874
01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:44.470
I never even heard of them.
They're fucking off.

1875
01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:50.560
What kind of music is it are awesome.
Polka fucking jazz.

1876
01:50:50.561 --> 01:50:53.730
Poca Rock,
rock,
rock and roll.
Rock and roll music.
Yeah.

1877
01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:56.890
Like if you had to compare him to someone,
that's the goal.

1878
01:50:56.891 --> 01:50:59.560
That's why they're so good is because it can't anybody else yet

1879
01:51:01.670 --> 01:51:05.470
a teeny bit.
I don't think we can,
unfortunately.
I'll listen to it off the air.

1880
01:51:05.471 --> 01:51:07.990
How do you say their name though?
And how do you spell arcade?
Fire.
Like,

1881
01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:12.390
like arcade game fire.
Anyway,
arcade fire.
Okay.

1882
01:51:13.930 --> 01:51:15.910
Listen to him on the way home.
What's draws a great town,

1883
01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:18.940
but no one cares about money.
And by the way,
that's what makes it great.

1884
01:51:19.170 --> 01:51:22.300
It's fantastic.
Well,
I really enjoyed it there.

1885
01:51:22.610 --> 01:51:24.580
I love a lot of very smart people that came out of their vice,

1886
01:51:24.581 --> 01:51:28.260
came out of there a place.
It's a fantastic fucking,
uh,

1887
01:51:28.420 --> 01:51:31.390
an excellent community of human beings.
It's fantastic.
Does that place,

1888
01:51:31.391 --> 01:51:34.590
the comedy works?
You know,
that place it's been around since,
but they used it.

1889
01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:39.460
The,
yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
Just for laughs in English.
They have a,

1890
01:51:39.461 --> 01:51:43.480
I was on there in 93.
Yeah.
Old schools.

1891
01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:48.160
I want to be a Canadian.
I don't want him,
I want to get out of here really.

1892
01:51:48.490 --> 01:51:51.760
Well you can,
if you want to go to the Philippines,
you can be an ask pat.

1893
01:51:51.970 --> 01:51:52.900
Did I ever tell you that?

1894
01:51:52.901 --> 01:51:56.530
Don't want an 80 in the Canadian journalists Philippines story.

1895
01:51:56.650 --> 01:52:00.820
No one ever told you that.
I don't think so.
I want to make that fucker a movie.

1896
01:52:03.610 --> 01:52:08.260
Okay.
I'll do it quick.
But it's a,
it's a true story.
There was a,

1897
01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:09.040
uh,

1898
01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:13.570
once upon a Time magazine called Saturday night in Canada,

1899
01:52:13.571 --> 01:52:18.040
which was the only time Canadian magazines were any good at one magazine.

1900
01:52:18.041 --> 01:52:21.850
That one magazine called Saturday night and they had this one writer and he was

1901
01:52:21.851 --> 01:52:25.300
like d rider.
He was like the Joe Rogan podcast,

1902
01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:29.950
but a variety of magazines.
Oh,
you're too kind.
And so he,

1903
01:52:30.250 --> 01:52:35.200
he was like this really respected,
like,
like he was like our young,
I don't know,

1904
01:52:35.201 --> 01:52:38.020
like a young hunter s Thompson like coming up like changing shit.

1905
01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:43.750
Anyway,
he kind of disappears,
like goes off.

1906
01:52:43.751 --> 01:52:47.600
And he had this young protege,
right?
Who,
who started writing going like,

1907
01:52:47.601 --> 01:52:49.460
what the fuck happened to my guy?
And they had the,

1908
01:52:49.461 --> 01:52:52.940
they were like having this real like what the fuck's going on?

1909
01:52:52.970 --> 01:52:56.780
But in the magazine it turns out that this guy,
this writer,

1910
01:52:56.781 --> 01:52:59.720
like real smart and credible writer,
whatever,

1911
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:04.520
went over to the Philippines to write a story and disappeared,
right?

1912
01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:09.920
And then,
uh,
his protege goes,
I'm going to go find him,
right?

1913
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:14.420
I'm going to go get this guy.
Oh,
and then what happens is that it's this,

1914
01:53:14.450 --> 01:53:17.510
now this is,
you got to imagine this is like politically correct Canada,

1915
01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:23.480
like really super liberal,
like right.

1916
01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:26.990
Politically correct.
Anyway,
okay.

1917
01:53:27.740 --> 01:53:31.580
So he goes over there and it turns out that this super,

1918
01:53:31.610 --> 01:53:36.050
like the most respected writer in the best magazine ended up living in a

1919
01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:41.060
whorehouse with like a young Filipino girl and he's,

1920
01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:45.520
he,
he,
he went like Kurt's into the jungle and he was like,
I'm not coming back.

1921
01:53:46.750 --> 01:53:47.583
So the,

1922
01:53:49.110 --> 01:53:54.110
so then actually I remember I got the story because he came back and he was like

1923
01:53:54.221 --> 01:53:58.930
in a,
in a Canadian supermarket and like he was letting the girl back,

1924
01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:02.290
no,
he had just come back for like Christmas or something,
supplies.

1925
01:54:02.291 --> 01:54:04.090
And he wrote this completely,

1926
01:54:04.330 --> 01:54:08.890
he wrote this completely scathing thing about the supermarket saying all this

1927
01:54:08.891 --> 01:54:11.500
food is shit.
It's fucking an edible.

1928
01:54:11.590 --> 01:54:15.640
The person at the fucking thing is like w pimply face.
They don't treat you nice.

1929
01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:20.170
But literally he just like basically had a scathing thing on Canada.

1930
01:54:20.170 --> 01:54:22.850
Now you have to imagine what happened to all the people cause they went

1931
01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:27.990
attacking Canada,
fuck you and fuck you know,
you're fucking in.

1932
01:54:28.210 --> 01:54:30.100
So there was this huge,

1933
01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:34.630
huge outpouring of like animosity towards this dude.

1934
01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:40.510
So then he has his protege goes,
you know,
and he's like,
fuck this guy.

1935
01:54:40.511 --> 01:54:41.410
And what happened to him?

1936
01:54:41.411 --> 01:54:44.710
And we've got to figure out what happened that you got him at Canadian fucking

1937
01:54:44.711 --> 01:54:49.090
apocalypse now.
Most of it.
So exactly.
So he goes over to Philippines to get him,

1938
01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:51.780
he's doing a horse stance and his underwear never asked,

1939
01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:57.080
never forget the first uh,
line of like,

1940
01:54:57.081 --> 01:55:00.350
cause it's,
it's really sanctimonious and against the sky and against his,

1941
01:55:00.850 --> 01:55:02.110
you know,
his mentor and all this stuff.

1942
01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:06.710
And he goes over and the first line of his dispatch from the Philippines is,

1943
01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:10.740
I shouldn't have put my tongue into her pussy because now it's covered with,

1944
01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:15.340
I mean film.
So he's gone there and he's gone,

1945
01:55:16.570 --> 01:55:19.960
he's gone.
He's gone into the heart of darkness.

1946
01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:23.530
And it is the hard anyways,
and this is all by the way,

1947
01:55:23.550 --> 01:55:25.900
and sort of my rose tinted retrospect,
but I was like,

1948
01:55:26.170 --> 01:55:31.170
what a great buddy film to make of like to sort of Canadian,

1949
01:55:32.590 --> 01:55:36.370
Chris Tucker and Bruce,
whoa.
Canadians.

1950
01:55:36.390 --> 01:55:40.580
Totally sort of like in an intellectual,
like,

1951
01:55:40.610 --> 01:55:44.010
like smart guys who ended up going to the Philippines.

1952
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:49.040
And just getting sucked into this abyss of like of,

1953
01:55:49.650 --> 01:55:53.200
of,
of,
you know,
the reason why we're talking about shit.

1954
01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:56.520
If you need a location Scout,
I'm down the Philippines.

1955
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:59.340
<v 0>This is like one of the best spots in the world.
If you're a pool player,</v>

1956
01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:03.080
there's like so many high level pool players in the Philippines,

1957
01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:05.970
like some of the greatest pool players of all times come out of the Philippines.

1958
01:56:06.330 --> 01:56:09.810
Apparently I don't want to play pool.
That's after the war.
The uh,

1959
01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:13.800
there's a lot of American Gis that were stationed in the Philippines and that

1960
01:56:13.801 --> 01:56:17.190
apparently this is what I first started the billiards craze.

1961
01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.930
I may or may not be correct about this.
Um,

1962
01:56:19.980 --> 01:56:21.890
but they're like this guy named effort.

1963
01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:26.070
Ray is like one of the top three pool players of all time.

1964
01:56:26.071 --> 01:56:31.071
He's a Filipino and there's like a whole bunch of Filipinos like Francisco

1965
01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:34.530
Bustamante Day and just like a million of them.

1966
01:56:34.531 --> 01:56:39.300
Like literally like there's so many like suit as far as like one small country

1967
01:56:39.301 --> 01:56:42.980
and what the numbers of like high level professional pool player,

1968
01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:47.580
the Philippines is like top to all the countries in the world.

1969
01:56:47.581 --> 01:56:49.670
It's incredible stories.

1970
01:56:50.330 --> 01:56:52.180
<v 5>See a pool store.
It's a snicker story.</v>

1971
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:56.920
Snuck her being I believe harder than full but it's uh,

1972
01:56:56.950 --> 01:57:00.940
the most successful.
Here's well discipline you on that is it?

1973
01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:04.810
It's very hard.
No doubt about it.
But it's a little different.

1974
01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:10.020
He might've played pool to the best pool players I think stand up to the best

1975
01:57:10.071 --> 01:57:12.370
sneaker players ever hear about this guy.
I'm going to ask you,

1976
01:57:12.371 --> 01:57:14.740
cause I might've been pulled to,
I think it might've been pool.

1977
01:57:14.770 --> 01:57:17.410
He was a snooker champion then it pool champion.
Which guy?

1978
01:57:17.710 --> 01:57:19.360
He's a is an English dude.

1979
01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:24.010
Big Fat guy and he drank 40 pints of beer a day.
Oh Tony.

1980
01:57:24.011 --> 01:57:27.880
A what the fuck's because he had a thing and he could take the pill but he

1981
01:57:27.881 --> 01:57:31.870
couldn't play pool or it could drink 40 pints in and he was the real world.

1982
01:57:31.900 --> 01:57:35.770
I believe he is a world pool champion for like two or three years.

1983
01:57:35.770 --> 01:57:39.730
He was a sneaker guy but he won the pool but he had to drink 40 beers a day

1984
01:57:39.731 --> 01:57:43.690
cause he had a murmur and his arm.
I don't know,
but I love that shit.

1985
01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:47.470
You're five feet two but you're going to be like,
you know the,

1986
01:57:47.740 --> 01:57:49.180
the the best basketball player.

1987
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:52.900
You have a fucking thing where your arm doesn't move but you're going to be

1988
01:57:52.901 --> 01:57:57.280
ranking can full player,
but if you drank enough you can do it ever.
Yeah.

1989
01:57:57.520 --> 01:58:01.840
Control over a spastic arm.
Yeah.
I don't know who that is.
Let me look that up.

1990
01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:06.030
There's so many 40 pints a day.
Pool player,
piano

1991
01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:10.080
<v 0>and from where?
From?
He's from the UK.
Yeah.</v>

1992
01:58:10.090 --> 01:58:13.330
There's a lot of snooker players that wind up doing really well in pool because

1993
01:58:13.331 --> 01:58:16.000
they have really good fundamentals because it's smaller pocket.

1994
01:58:16.001 --> 01:58:20.050
It's really difficult to pot what they call pot laws.
Yeah,
it's a bigger table.

1995
01:58:20.051 --> 01:58:24.100
Smaller pockets.
It's a very,
very,
very,
very,
very difficult game.

1996
01:58:24.101 --> 01:58:27.880
But it's a different game.
Bigger cue ball and moving,

1997
01:58:28.210 --> 01:58:31.390
moving the cue ball around for position ball.
The ball is slightly

1998
01:58:31.470 --> 01:58:35.850
<v 5>bill where that's the guy.
What did he win though?
Did He,</v>

1999
01:58:35.851 --> 01:58:39.230
was he pulled champion too or just he wasn't best dressed dork.

2000
01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:42.340
January,
1947

2001
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:46.210
<v 1>through 2003 he was Canadian professionals snicker in pool player.</v>

2002
01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:50.080
A recognizable for his girth.
He nicknamed big bill.

2003
01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:53.980
How do you know this was the guy?
Because when I googled what,

2004
01:58:54.130 --> 01:58:58.240
like the 40 pounds a day here,
alcohol consumption,
what does it say?

2005
01:58:58.480 --> 01:58:59.430
I can't read it.
Uh,

2006
01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:04.440
he was noted for he up to 30 pints of lager per day city that he generally drink

2007
01:59:04.661 --> 01:59:08.650
around six pints of lager before match.
And then one pint for each frame.

2008
01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:13.800
He said he did it to contract that familiar benign tumor that he had is oh wow.

2009
01:59:14.921 --> 01:59:16.870
He had a tumor later in his career.

2010
01:59:16.871 --> 01:59:21.490
He also took up pro Pollino a better blocker to cope with the effects of the

2011
01:59:21.491 --> 01:59:26.440
idea he ever did he ever,
uh,
when the Pool Championship?
Um,

2012
01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:28.420
<v 6>yeah,</v>

2013
01:59:28.420 --> 01:59:29.920
<v 0>I think it was pool and snooker.</v>

2014
01:59:31.380 --> 01:59:31.700
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

2015
01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:35.250
There's a lot of those guys that come out yet rolled snicker championship four

2016
01:59:35.251 --> 01:59:35.990
times.

2017
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.823
<v 0>All right,</v>

2018
01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:41.030
here's a bunch of snuck her champions that have become really good at pool.

2019
01:59:41.031 --> 01:59:42.880
They started doing really well and like the uh,

2020
01:59:42.970 --> 01:59:46.160
Mosconi Cup and they started doing really well on the pro tour.

2021
01:59:46.161 --> 01:59:50.000
I know a few guys have woman,
Darrin Appleton who's a sneaker champion.

2022
01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:53.880
He and he played English eight ball too.
He won the uh,
what's English?

2023
01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:57.170
And it's just different,
different styles of April.

2024
01:59:57.710 --> 02:00:02.360
What happened eight ball after the color of money.
No pool band.

2025
02:00:02.361 --> 02:00:07.250
Pool is,
people don't play it.
It's too hard.
Video Games are easier.
You know,

2026
02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:11.230
it's easier to run out in a video game.
And when you,
when you're playing,

2027
02:00:11.240 --> 02:00:13.610
especially if you're gambling or you're playing in a tournament,

2028
02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.090
when you're playing pool,
it's really difficult to hold your nerves together.

2029
02:00:17.091 --> 02:00:21.280
Shot to shot.
And it's very challenging.
It's very challenging mentally.

2030
02:00:21.281 --> 02:00:23.540
And why was he ball so big?
Well,

2031
02:00:23.541 --> 02:00:27.800
eight balls because you have more options and people got that suck.

2032
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:30.650
They liked it as a whole bunch of balls all over the place and they can pick

2033
02:00:30.651 --> 02:00:33.650
anyone they want to shoot at.
Right.
That's initially,

2034
02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:38.980
but April's a very strategic game because when you deal with 15 balls supposed

2035
02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:39.830
tonight,

2036
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:42.860
how many people want to slice the rest right now and jump off a building?

2037
02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:47.180
Shane Smith asked me about pool.
Yeah.
Um,
when you,
uh,

2038
02:00:47.210 --> 02:00:50.030
when you have like a,
a really high level player,

2039
02:00:50.031 --> 02:00:53.810
then it becomes interesting because then it becomes very strategic because you

2040
02:00:53.811 --> 02:00:56.870
have to figure out what should I choose?

2041
02:00:56.930 --> 02:01:00.460
Should I be choose colors a showed two stripes because one of them I,

2042
02:01:00.461 --> 02:01:02.840
there's a pattern and the other one,
it doesn't exist.
Right?

2043
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:05.090
And so I have to figure out whether or not I can get out.

2044
02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:07.460
And when you're playing a high level player,
it's,

2045
02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:11.540
it's all about the percentages that you can clear the frame,
clear the table,

2046
02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:13.010
right?
It's,
that's what it's all about.

2047
02:01:13.190 --> 02:01:16.880
And if you watch like the best players like the and ray is and the Earl

2048
02:01:16.880 --> 02:01:17.210
Strickland's,

2049
02:01:17.210 --> 02:01:20.780
it's all about if you give them a chance to get loose then they start clearing

2050
02:01:20.781 --> 02:01:23.720
tables and when you start they start running out racks and hitting you with

2051
02:01:23.721 --> 02:01:27.260
packages are all Strickland.
You want to know how bad ass motherfucker was.

2052
02:01:27.740 --> 02:01:29.240
Earl struck and there was a a thing.

2053
02:01:29.330 --> 02:01:33.860
This guy CJ Wiley who's a very famous pool player and world champion,

2054
02:01:33.861 --> 02:01:37.730
real high level player himself was a promoter of this event and he got an

2055
02:01:37.731 --> 02:01:42.620
insurance policy on the that uh,
if anybody ever ran 10 racks in a row,

2056
02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:44.560
they would get $1 billion,
right?

2057
02:01:44.690 --> 02:01:48.740
The odds you run a 10 racks if you live a hundred lifetimes are like a hundred

2058
02:01:48.741 --> 02:01:52.560
to one the nobody runs 10 racks,
right?
Because if you break in front out,

2059
02:01:52.590 --> 02:01:55.610
even if you like you,
you can hit a guy with like a six pack.

2060
02:01:55.610 --> 02:02:00.110
Like the odds of you getting a shot on the one ball,
the first opening ball,

2061
02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:04.430
there's so small because you break when you break the ball scatter randomly,

2062
02:02:04.431 --> 02:02:05.210
you don't know what's happened.

2063
02:02:05.210 --> 02:02:08.060
So the idea that a guy could write out 10 in a row seemed impossible.

2064
02:02:08.150 --> 02:02:11.390
So they put a million dollar insurance policy on it where Earl Strickland's this

2065
02:02:11.391 --> 02:02:16.391
crazy dude from North Carolina and he does not give one 10th of one fuck.

2066
02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:17.630
Okay.

2067
02:02:17.630 --> 02:02:21.380
So he's in there and he's playing in this tournament and he knows that there's a

2068
02:02:21.381 --> 02:02:23.300
10 rack,
$1 million challenge.

2069
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:27.830
So he starts blasting nine balls in running packages.

2070
02:02:27.950 --> 02:02:32.950
He's running seven a now he's making half table length combinations on the nine

2071
02:02:34.431 --> 02:02:37.820
bullet could,
same shit he would never do.
If you're playing for $1 million,

2072
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:41.420
he's free stroking for $1 million.
Right?

2073
02:02:41.450 --> 02:02:43.430
And he runs a 11 racks,

2074
02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:48.790
not just 10 11 following in combos and just,

2075
02:02:49.070 --> 02:02:52.970
or just running stupid rags banking out for the cheese when it's like

2076
02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:57.800
unbelievable pool plan and they don't want to give him the money because there's

2077
02:02:57.801 --> 02:02:59.630
a definition of like running a rack.

2078
02:02:59.630 --> 02:03:01.640
Like if you make a combination on the nine ball,

2079
02:03:01.670 --> 02:03:05.540
it's like a three nine combination,
you know,
is that running the rack?

2080
02:03:05.570 --> 02:03:07.970
You know what,
what did you,
what did you decide?

2081
02:03:08.140 --> 02:03:12.890
Is it winning the game cause nine balls a game where you run one ball to the two

2082
02:03:12.891 --> 02:03:16.220
bald,
the three ball,
you always gotta hit the lowest number of ball on the table.

2083
02:03:16.221 --> 02:03:20.770
Everything is wild,
right?
And so it's a,
it's a game of packages putting packages.

2084
02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:23.630
The guy,
the odds of a guy putting together 10 racks is what happened.

2085
02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:25.490
They had to settle out of court.

2086
02:03:25.491 --> 02:03:27.740
They had to give him like a percentage of the cheese.

2087
02:03:28.010 --> 02:03:32.030
They didn't give it all to him,
but unfortunately the world,
you know,

2088
02:03:32.150 --> 02:03:35.630
we'll never know how crazy that is because if you've never played pool,

2089
02:03:35.631 --> 02:03:38.600
you don't know how insane that is.
It's like getting like 18 holes in one.

2090
02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:41.780
It doesn't even make sense.
Like how the fuck did he do that?

2091
02:03:42.050 --> 02:03:47.030
How the fuck does he run 11 racks at of row on tight tables for $1 million?

2092
02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:50.750
Right?
It's like people reach those weird heights.

2093
02:03:50.770 --> 02:03:55.520
You know those weird Cassius clay versus Cleveland,
big Cat Williams Heights.

2094
02:03:55.700 --> 02:03:58.550
When you watch a guy performing,
do you go Jesus Christ,

2095
02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:01.590
like we just hit some new level.
You can just hit some,

2096
02:04:01.630 --> 02:04:04.850
some new revolutions per minute.
That's never been achieved before,

2097
02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:11.080
but people don't understand that shit.
So they,
to me pool is like a,

2098
02:04:11.081 --> 02:04:14.210
it's an art form that the only people that appreciate it,
the people that do it.

2099
02:04:14.450 --> 02:04:16.430
So if you don't play pool,
you're not going to appreciate it.

2100
02:04:16.790 --> 02:04:20.690
And you think about it less people playfulness,
weightless,
not true.
Yeah.

2101
02:04:20.970 --> 02:04:24.410
I mean I played pool the other day,
but you did take it to another level.

2102
02:04:24.411 --> 02:04:29.330
You take a look to this dirty levelers no.
Well who was my,
my savior.

2103
02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:33.440
My,
my bridge between getting injured in martial arts and then becoming a standup

2104
02:04:33.441 --> 02:04:38.130
comedian and pool was my bridge cause I tore my ACL and uh,
I was still

2105
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:39.750
<v 2>like,
uh,
I was still competing.</v>

2106
02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:44.880
And then when I tore my ACL I had like a six month downtime or had to do rehab

2107
02:04:44.881 --> 02:04:48.450
and all that jazz.
And that was the time that I got addicted to pool.

2108
02:04:48.451 --> 02:04:51.210
It was during my rehab cause I can still walk around,
I go play pool.

2109
02:04:51.211 --> 02:04:55.050
It wasn't a stress on my knee.
And I became fascinated with his fucking name,

2110
02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:58.650
but it's not easy to do.
And so I went from this,

2111
02:04:59.090 --> 02:05:02.280
this incredibly psychotic connection to martial arts,

2112
02:05:02.281 --> 02:05:04.890
to this incredibly psychotic connection to that.

2113
02:05:05.280 --> 02:05:10.280
So it became like a way for me to get out all of these ideas that I have in my

2114
02:05:10.411 --> 02:05:15.411
head about like about like competing against things and about like knocking in

2115
02:05:16.321 --> 02:05:20.420
things and controlling things.
It's like a vehicle,
you know,
again,

2116
02:05:20.730 --> 02:05:25.200
like anything else has you see if we see bad ass badminton players,
he was like,

2117
02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:29.790
some dude told me to check out high level badminton online.
I'm like,
what?

2118
02:05:29.970 --> 02:05:31.050
And he's like,
you'd be surprised.

2119
02:05:31.051 --> 02:05:33.510
Like there's all these fakes and all these different movements.
I'm like,
okay,

2120
02:05:33.990 --> 02:05:38.350
yes.
Yeah,
it's crazy.
Right?
But if you don't know if you,

2121
02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:41.910
I bet if you play badminton,
you're like God damn bad mittens,
the shifts.

2122
02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:45.690
But if I asked you,
Hey Shane Smith,
would you like to play badminton with me?

2123
02:05:45.900 --> 02:05:46.201
You play.

2124
02:05:46.201 --> 02:05:50.940
Can I call you back between playing badminton but the fuck are you talking

2125
02:05:50.941 --> 02:05:55.490
about?
That's a dead man's game.
What are you living in?
1970.
What do you have?
Uh,

2126
02:05:55.850 --> 02:06:00.450
a white when,
when was the highlight of Admin in this country?
Never.

2127
02:06:00.451 --> 02:06:02.700
It never happened.
It's a golf game.
I mean,

2128
02:06:02.701 --> 02:06:05.610
it's a long game and that's some shit you do in your backyard.

2129
02:06:05.850 --> 02:06:08.760
When was it croquet that if you want to,
you want to do some coke?
Hey,
I'm down.

2130
02:06:09.090 --> 02:06:13.230
But when was it big?
I don't even know.
There was nothing.
It's like tennis.

2131
02:06:13.231 --> 02:06:14.790
It's kind of tenants.
But with your ball.

2132
02:06:14.791 --> 02:06:17.850
Who is this guy and why is he holding up 10 fingers?

2133
02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:21.300
He started getting me out of here.
What do you got next?
What do you have to,

2134
02:06:21.390 --> 02:06:25.920
what do you,
where are you going next?
Uh,
I have to go have a business dinner.

2135
02:06:26.490 --> 02:06:30.480
What Times that we probably missed it,
I think.
How dare you?

2136
02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:36.000
Oh no shit.
It's only 4:00 PM in Hawaii,
right?
It's seven.

2137
02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:39.330
I thought it was like,
I would've said it was two in the morning.

2138
02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:45.770
It should be Jack Daniels.
This is,
she should be,
she should never bring those.

2139
02:06:45.820 --> 02:06:49.290
These other people don't bring them anymore.
They probably,
they cause problems.

2140
02:06:49.291 --> 02:06:52.650
They want to control things.
Hold up.
Fingers tell you about schedules.

2141
02:06:52.770 --> 02:06:56.340
This is all nonsense.
You done mushrooms.
You know what I'm saying?

2142
02:06:56.370 --> 02:07:00.870
Don't fucking bullshit me here.
Okay?
It's 10 fingers are nonsense.
This,

2143
02:07:00.871 --> 02:07:04.050
this is eternity right here.
This,
okay?
This is encrypted.

2144
02:07:04.830 --> 02:07:07.740
Someday this would be the projected on a cave wall.

2145
02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:13.140
I would like them with the day Shane Smith,
Trump science.
It would be,

2146
02:07:13.141 --> 02:07:16.560
it would make day.
We all figured it out the day we realized that.

2147
02:07:16.561 --> 02:07:20.580
We're like a couple of years away from getting their shit together.
I hope so.

2148
02:07:21.270 --> 02:07:24.060
Do you are you will be out of business bro.
We didn't do,

2149
02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:28.140
we didn't know it and write stories about nice things.
Flowers and shit.

2150
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:31.640
Blow jobs,
flowers and little Jon.

2151
02:07:31.650 --> 02:07:33.720
I'm handjobs and ice cream.

2152
02:07:33.721 --> 02:07:38.200
How to give the best hand with a flower and I had to go gluten free.
Sure.

2153
02:07:38.470 --> 02:07:41.050
All those things.
Is that the future?

2154
02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:46.830
What does that,
why did you have play in elephant?
Okay.

2155
02:07:47.450 --> 02:07:50.020
There's sometimes you have ideas in your head and what you need to do is you

2156
02:07:50.021 --> 02:07:54.670
need to count to 10 and at the end of that 10 if you have any doubt whatsoever

2157
02:07:54.671 --> 02:07:59.560
that this is a good idea.
Don't do it.
Okay.
That's my advice to you.
Okay.

2158
02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:03.300
I like to work with restrictions.
I like to work with La,

2159
02:08:03.301 --> 02:08:07.330
a little land mines and roadblocks and that's what he's here for.
Okay.

2160
02:08:07.570 --> 02:08:10.660
Keeps me on my toes.
I know it doesn't make sense to most people,

2161
02:08:10.810 --> 02:08:14.530
but I think I have to a plasma just dealing with it.

2162
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:19.840
Dealing with the best I can.
How has it been?
How's it been?

2163
02:08:19.900 --> 02:08:23.670
Stopped with the sound effects.
Who is the Adam Carolla show?
Oh shit though.

2164
02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:28.680
He did no [inaudible] Fox type shit.

2165
02:08:29.210 --> 02:08:34.030
I have hair.
Okay.
Just joking around.
Um,
how's HBO but gone?
You can join it.

2166
02:08:34.840 --> 02:08:39.610
Yeah,
they're nice.
I really liked the show man.
Look man,
by the way,

2167
02:08:39.970 --> 02:08:43.720
on demand.
Oh cool.
Hbo Is Greatest.
They have the greatest,

2168
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:48.090
the two greatest in the history of humanity.
The Co two greatest shows ever.
Well,

2169
02:08:48.490 --> 02:08:52.060
the Sopranos and game of Thrones,
there's no second.
That's it.

2170
02:08:52.090 --> 02:08:54.390
There's not even a deadwood.

2171
02:08:54.700 --> 02:08:58.240
How dare you dare you wire the wire is really good.
But

2172
02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:03.730
I never watched more than two episodes of the wire and I did enjoy it,

2173
02:09:03.731 --> 02:09:05.230
but I never got into it but dead.
What else?

2174
02:09:05.231 --> 02:09:08.250
Like I don't believe they swore that much.
Oh yeah,
I loved that.

2175
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:12.760
Game of Thrones is awesome.
His premise is awesome.
Those are the two best,

2176
02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:17.020
in my opinion,
my two favorite all time.
But I gotta be honest.
It sounds crazy,

2177
02:09:17.021 --> 02:09:21.190
but that fucking showtime show the terrorist guy.
But what does that show?

2178
02:09:21.310 --> 02:09:25.960
A home homeland.
Homeland.
That is right fucking up there.

2179
02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:30.490
Right fucking up there and walking dead is and isn't.

2180
02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:33.820
There's episodes of the walking dead you like,
is this the $6 million man?

2181
02:09:33.940 --> 02:09:37.750
And I go back and fucking time and my watching Steve Austin fight and bigfoot,

2182
02:09:37.900 --> 02:09:41.470
this shit is retarded.
There's this episodes of the walking dad would be like,

2183
02:09:41.471 --> 02:09:45.760
who wrote this one?
Find him,
tell him to stop,

2184
02:09:46.180 --> 02:09:49.630
tell him to stop.
Whose idea was this?
How did this happen?

2185
02:09:49.810 --> 02:09:54.220
But then there's other ones.
If you just had to watch a show game of Thrones.

2186
02:09:54.290 --> 02:09:57.580
Yeah,
me too.
No,
not even close.
To me,
they're making,

2187
02:09:58.670 --> 02:10:03.290
they're making a,
what is it,
the woman from Gilmore girls,

2188
02:10:03.330 --> 02:10:06.280
Lord and his radio.
They're doing lord of the rings every week.

2189
02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:10.090
They're literally doing it.
Lord.
Something's better.

2190
02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:12.940
Better than Lord of the rings.
Because the thing about Lord of the Rings,

2191
02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:15.730
and I'm a,
by the way,
I should state this.

2192
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:19.390
I'm a huge dog and our token Dork,

2193
02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:22.330
that's the name or what the fuck is his name?
Jr Jr Tolkien.

2194
02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:25.210
I know I had it wrong.
So you're not the Hobbit,
Lord of the rings.

2195
02:10:25.330 --> 02:10:28.690
I read them all when I was a young boy and I remember them being like,
you know,

2196
02:10:28.691 --> 02:10:32.590
amazing,
amazing,
like just escapes from life.

2197
02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:34.160
And it was a huge fan of their work.

2198
02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:38.330
<v 0>But the problem is that these books are incredibly long.</v>

2199
02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:42.920
And to condense them into a movie and keep the subtle nuances story,

2200
02:10:43.220 --> 02:10:45.070
like one of the beautiful things was like the,

2201
02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:49.010
the struggle of Bilbo Baggins carrying this ring and the whole day.

2202
02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:50.001
There's so much,

2203
02:10:50.001 --> 02:10:53.840
there's so much to it and the hundreds and hundreds of pages that to try to

2204
02:10:53.841 --> 02:10:55.690
condense that to a movie,
you're gonna,

2205
02:10:55.970 --> 02:10:58.120
you're gonna mess a lot of what made it cool.
Yeah.

2206
02:10:58.190 --> 02:11:02.300
So that's why the hobbit was to me a little bit.
I mean,
I had to see it.

2207
02:11:02.330 --> 02:11:06.560
It's my duty as a fan to see it,
but it was like,

2208
02:11:06.740 --> 02:11:11.540
and then this happens and then that happens.
Like I don't,
I don't feel invested.

2209
02:11:11.541 --> 02:11:14.960
I don't feel,
it's like,
I feel like you're rushing this whole idea and I'm not,

2210
02:11:15.170 --> 02:11:16.003
I'm not connecting,

2211
02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:17.850
<v 2>but game of Thrones or like,</v>

2212
02:11:17.851 --> 02:11:21.630
here are the fucking dragon and there's some shit coming down from the fucking

2213
02:11:21.780 --> 02:11:25.740
Antarctica and they go gangster as all humanly possible.

2214
02:11:25.741 --> 02:11:30.150
They make the soprano's looked like sesame street.
Well,
red wedding was God damn.

2215
02:11:30.151 --> 02:11:33.510
Don't say anymore.
It's,
wow are a spoiler alert.

2216
02:11:33.980 --> 02:11:35.090
<v 0>It's just an amazing show.</v>

2217
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:40.270
And I think that that's one of the cool downsides to a or cool upsides to the

2218
02:11:40.521 --> 02:11:44.540
downside of the film industry is that it's harder and harder for the film

2219
02:11:44.541 --> 02:11:48.890
industry to try to.
What does that badminton,
that men,
it's a dead man's game.

2220
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:52.340
It's harder and harder for the film industry.

2221
02:11:52.341 --> 02:11:55.030
It's harder for people with original ideas to get the mail.
Hold on,
hold on.

2222
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:59.110
<v 2>Did that just happen?
Yeah.
Somebody made that online as we were saying falling.</v>

2223
02:11:59.510 --> 02:12:00.910
It's not like,
yeah,

2224
02:12:00.980 --> 02:12:03.880
you'd not respect me if that was like one of my standard lines.

2225
02:12:04.180 --> 02:12:06.700
He no dog have been talk about badminton.

2226
02:12:06.990 --> 02:12:09.400
Been talking shit on badminton since way back.

2227
02:12:10.290 --> 02:12:15.180
But do we find out the golden age of bed?
No,
we never did.
It never happened.

2228
02:12:15.190 --> 02:12:19.030
Just there was an idea.
But the pros like they are really pat ass.

2229
02:12:19.031 --> 02:12:21.280
If he watched like really high level ping pong guys,

2230
02:12:21.281 --> 02:12:23.020
he'll be fucking impress upon.
It's crazy.

2231
02:12:23.770 --> 02:12:27.550
How far did they get away from the table?
Like I get really far away.

2232
02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:31.600
Pink Pong guys have to cause that shit is coming and crazy and you gotta be able

2233
02:12:31.601 --> 02:12:33.070
to dart in and dart out.

2234
02:12:33.100 --> 02:12:37.750
You've got to have these explosive fast twitch muscle fibers and a lot of tech

2235
02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:40.690
that Howard Howard Cosell of the cause.

2236
02:12:40.740 --> 02:12:45.360
You're like now calling the greatest ping pong game I've ever heard.
Yeah,

2237
02:12:45.361 --> 02:12:49.650
I'm a retard.
That's what it is.
Why don't you plug into the,

2238
02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:53.200
I don't like other sports.
I would call,
come on professional.
I said to you,

2239
02:12:53.830 --> 02:12:58.510
America versus China Ping Pong Championship came down and get bored.
Fuck off.

2240
02:12:58.780 --> 02:12:59.790
I don't have enough things.

2241
02:13:00.060 --> 02:13:02.530
There's too many things that I'm obsessed with already.

2242
02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:03.860
The last thing I want to do,

2243
02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:08.960
it was such a ping pong North America versus North Korea for I would war war,

2244
02:13:13.230 --> 02:13:17.670
but they have to play a game of ping pong.
Whoever wins,
you have to call it.

2245
02:13:17.671 --> 02:13:22.450
What do you do it?
Yes,
sure.
Think I'm a patriot.
I would do that.

2246
02:13:22.930 --> 02:13:24.700
I think that would be interesting,
but that would,

2247
02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:28.030
that would be like full on running man.
I wouldn't go though this.
I don't know.

2248
02:13:28.270 --> 02:13:29.380
It's fucking wouldn't go well.

2249
02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:34.080
They'll probably pay more attention to bad men and they're closer to death.

2250
02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:37.170
So probably be real problematic here.

2251
02:13:38.340 --> 02:13:42.720
Going back to what material?
Yeah,
I've been doing some old shit.
I was,

2252
02:13:42.721 --> 02:13:45.740
he putting them back on the um,

2253
02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:48.120
badminton,

2254
02:13:48.121 --> 02:13:51.720
all those games that are like really old that had been around for a long time.

2255
02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:52.740
Polo and shit.

2256
02:13:52.770 --> 02:13:57.070
Like how much longer can polo keep going at a certain point in time?

2257
02:13:57.071 --> 02:13:57.891
I'm going to run out of Rachel.

2258
02:13:57.891 --> 02:14:01.020
You know the weird thing about it is they don't actually play Polo.

2259
02:14:01.470 --> 02:14:05.720
They don't know what do they do?
What if my,
what happens?
They hired a dude,

2260
02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:10.490
<v 5>this is the whole thing.
I was like,
cause uh,
we were,
you know,</v>

2261
02:14:10.700 --> 02:14:12.710
Coachella is on the Polo grounds,
right?

2262
02:14:13.070 --> 02:14:15.230
So we went out early to film this thing and they're like,
oh,

2263
02:14:15.231 --> 02:14:20.210
there's Paulo here and it's all these Argentinian ringers and Uruguayan ringers

2264
02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:24.230
that the guys filled their teams with the pay,
like I don't know,

2265
02:14:24.290 --> 02:14:27.530
hundreds of thousands of dollars to have the team.
And then they,

2266
02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:29.360
but they don't play themselves.

2267
02:14:29.361 --> 02:14:33.920
They hire a young buck to go out and play and you're like,

2268
02:14:34.530 --> 02:14:35.000
wow,

2269
02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:36.050
<v 2>what are you doing?</v>

2270
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:41.450
So they hired a guy like a wild dude to ride their horse and whack their ball.

2271
02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:44.330
Yeah.
There you go.
So they,
they're,
they're essentially,

2272
02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:47.630
they're the people that own horses and team.

2273
02:14:47.631 --> 02:14:51.490
So they have someone represent them individually.
Is that what it is?
Yeah,
it's a,

2274
02:14:51.491 --> 02:14:53.060
it's a sport of ringers.

2275
02:14:54.530 --> 02:14:59.140
It sounds like doosh doosh central,
the word duty.

2276
02:14:59.150 --> 02:15:02.540
She has people that are like,
how many,
how many more years can polo keep going?

2277
02:15:02.840 --> 02:15:06.660
Yeah.
Like if he like found out dude was like super into

2278
02:15:06.710 --> 02:15:09.230
<v 5>Paula,
I don't think it,
I don't think it can keep going.
And you know,</v>

2279
02:15:09.231 --> 02:15:14.090
it comes from by cash or whatever,
which is what the guys had or

2280
02:15:14.540 --> 02:15:18.520
<v 2>really?
Yeah.
Well that makes it way better.
Or also they now they deal with a,</v>

2281
02:15:18.530 --> 02:15:22.130
like a sheep,
a sheep pen or a sheep and actual,

2282
02:15:22.131 --> 02:15:25.820
she'd have to like pull the sheep through the field.
Wow.

2283
02:15:25.850 --> 02:15:29.330
With like hooks or something.
Like how do you hook up with your hand,

2284
02:15:29.810 --> 02:15:32.390
reach out and grab it and the horse runs?
Yeah.

2285
02:15:32.391 --> 02:15:34.990
And then the other people tried to get the sheet.
It's like,
it looks like Paulo,

2286
02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.180
but with the sheep,
those people needed the Internet.

2287
02:15:38.450 --> 02:15:42.500
But that's where Polo came from.
The Internet.
But I answer to your question,

2288
02:15:42.501 --> 02:15:45.380
I don't think it lasts much longer.
Yeah.
There's a lot of those,

2289
02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:50.300
those old school sports that you like,
come on son.
The decathlon.
Really,

2290
02:15:50.810 --> 02:15:53.690
really Bruce Jenner.
What else do we got?
What's in the old,

2291
02:15:53.691 --> 02:15:55.270
the oldest support leave.
Fuck.

2292
02:15:55.370 --> 02:15:58.700
How about curling that shit they do in Canada.

2293
02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:03.530
You guys push those weird looking hockey pucks across the ice.
Brooms.

2294
02:16:04.010 --> 02:16:08.410
Yeah.
And they sweep the,
sweep the ice to get it nice and clean.
So the,

2295
02:16:08.411 --> 02:16:11.760
the thing really slides.
Yeah.
Hi Larry.
This,

2296
02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:13.310
I don't know what you're even talking about.

2297
02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:17.060
It's one of the most hilarious sports of all time watching that you're like,

2298
02:16:17.061 --> 02:16:19.010
God damn the best.
What are these?

2299
02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:22.340
These people living up here where it's cold as fuck.
They're like,

2300
02:16:22.341 --> 02:16:25.400
it's gotta be more cool shit.
We can do it in the cold.
I like

2301
02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:30.100
Canadians,
political systems and I agree,
but when

2302
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:34.000
<v 5>you start fucking with curling,
I'm like,
fuck you.
Curling is awesome.</v>

2303
02:16:34.100 --> 02:16:36.560
They're like,
let's slide smooth rocks.

2304
02:16:36.940 --> 02:16:41.800
That should be way better than like animated movies are interesting books.

2305
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:43.780
Oh yeah.

2306
02:16:43.781 --> 02:16:46.990
How did that become like a big sport and get so big that it became in the

2307
02:16:46.991 --> 02:16:50.770
Olympics?
Because curling is in the Olympics.
I don't know.
That's pretty insane.

2308
02:16:50.920 --> 02:16:55.000
Yeah.
How old?
Who else does it?
It's like Canadians and who else?
We always win.

2309
02:16:58.160 --> 02:17:01.970
<v 2>Who else is doing it?
You're winning one of the craziest game</v>

2310
02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:06.530
<v 5>[inaudible] of all time.
Maybe Finland,
Finland.
Fuck Finland,
man.
I do that.</v>

2311
02:17:06.550 --> 02:17:09.270
I don't really mean that.
I said,
tell him I finished friends.

2312
02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:10.960
I don't really mean that.
I'm just bullshit.

2313
02:17:11.460 --> 02:17:14.100
I would've said Fuck Denmark if he said Denmark.
I don't mean that either.

2314
02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:17.490
I don't mean that either.
Are they good at it?
They're good at it.

2315
02:17:18.770 --> 02:17:19.880
Then rocky is good.

2316
02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:22.530
<v 2>It's a handle.
It's got a handle on a fucking,</v>

2317
02:17:23.490 --> 02:17:25.250
I don't even know what's happened now.

2318
02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:31.170
The problem is is there was this one drunk podcast went south.

2319
02:17:31.530 --> 02:17:33.670
No,
it was perfect.
It didn't go sign.
Now

2320
02:17:36.110 --> 02:17:40.090
we're talking about Denmark and correct people.
We love him with Joe.

2321
02:17:42.630 --> 02:17:46.400
Fuck America.
Fuck Canada.
I don't mean anything was saying.

2322
02:17:46.930 --> 02:17:49.650
We're just talking shit.
This is called talking shit.
If you love me,

2323
02:17:49.651 --> 02:17:54.180
I can talk shit about you.
You can talk shit about me
when I'm being serious.

2324
02:17:54.181 --> 02:17:58.740
We don't really need fuck Denmark.
I'm,
I have no animosity at Denmark.
See Jokes.

2325
02:17:59.100 --> 02:18:00.180
They're not even good jokes.

2326
02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:03.450
We just swinging their folks trying to make you happy.
Okay.

2327
02:18:03.451 --> 02:18:06.180
No one's trying to hurt anybody's feelings,
especially not strange.

2328
02:18:06.181 --> 02:18:09.990
People from some frozen country filled with Douche bags.
I'm just kidding.

2329
02:18:09.991 --> 02:18:10.890
I made that part up.

2330
02:18:11.310 --> 02:18:15.630
<v 5>Smells like queefs whole place to sit.
You just made that up.</v>

2331
02:18:15.780 --> 02:18:17.490
He made that up.
I don't even support him.

2332
02:18:18.330 --> 02:18:21.700
I don't think it smells like he's never been there.
You know when,

2333
02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:25.980
if a pussy smells like fish,
that means there's old come inside of it.
Allegedly.

2334
02:18:26.140 --> 02:18:30.210
Yeah.
No,
I just mean she's got a fishing or pussy.
You don't know shit.

2335
02:18:31.730 --> 02:18:34.260
<v 2>Then with that girl,
you have a fight about this.
The last time I was here,</v>

2336
02:18:34.290 --> 02:18:36.450
I highly doubt that.
I think we did.

2337
02:18:37.020 --> 02:18:41.290
We had a fight sperms,
sperms.

2338
02:18:41.340 --> 02:18:44.940
It goes for the egg and one.
Oh yeah.
You're like,
oh,
hell no,
no,
no.

2339
02:18:44.941 --> 02:18:48.000
It was actually no sperm fighting other sperm.

2340
02:18:48.090 --> 02:18:50.850
It was unfortunately disapproved because it's a beautiful theory.

2341
02:18:50.851 --> 02:18:54.270
The idea that there's some sperm that serve the only purpose they serve as to

2342
02:18:54.271 --> 02:18:56.430
kill off fighting.
I'm fighting.
That's not true.

2343
02:18:56.580 --> 02:18:59.560
Apparently it was a one guy wrote a book.
Let's,
let's look at it.

2344
02:19:00.270 --> 02:19:03.730
It's been pretty much,
I've got to say,
I don't want it to be disproved.

2345
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:06.180
I don't want it to be disproven either.
That's the problem.

2346
02:19:06.181 --> 02:19:07.890
I'll deal with this new shell I'm doing.

2347
02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:10.890
There's a lot of shit that gets disproven that I don't really want to be

2348
02:19:10.891 --> 02:19:14.820
disproven.
God Damn it.
Really good for you though.

2349
02:19:15.620 --> 02:19:17.100
I don't know if it was you,
but I,
I told

2350
02:19:17.100 --> 02:19:18.990
<v 5>somebody,
I said,
there's two types of sperm.</v>

2351
02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:22.620
One that goes for the egg and one that fights he was from and they said,
no,

2352
02:19:22.621 --> 02:19:26.880
that's not true,
but the penis is shaped like a

2353
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:32.540
to scoop out the sperm that's in there.
Really?

2354
02:19:33.290 --> 02:19:36.740
Yes.
That is true.
That is absolutely true.
I was about to say,

2355
02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:39.710
if you're saying that there's not two types of sprint,
but yeah,

2356
02:19:39.711 --> 02:19:42.860
the plunger Shit's true.
The shamans apps environment,

2357
02:19:42.861 --> 02:19:45.140
we not screwing with the plunger,

2358
02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:49.390
but the two types is from not right.
Are you talking about Dolphin comic?

2359
02:19:49.420 --> 02:19:54.190
Can't remember.
Was it kind of Shit I was covered in dog.
Yeah.

2360
02:19:54.360 --> 02:19:58.630
You know that.
Yeah.
I'm,
you know,
God damn well I was covered in dolphin come.

2361
02:19:58.690 --> 02:20:02.700
I told,
I actually touched a dolphin's vagina on my showrooms at Sera.

2362
02:20:04.180 --> 02:20:05.960
That's frowned upon.
Well,
no,

2363
02:20:05.961 --> 02:20:08.930
we were allowed to touch it and I didn't know that the vagina was shut like it.

2364
02:20:08.931 --> 02:20:11.890
Like you can't see it when it's shut.
It's just a line.
And so I was just like,
oh,

2365
02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:12.793
that would hold up

2366
02:20:12.830 --> 02:20:15.680
<v 0>court except for the fact you talked about it before you went down there.</v>

2367
02:20:15.890 --> 02:20:20.840
Fuck you.
Craver dolphin creeper.
He doesn't even remember what he talked about.

2368
02:20:21.180 --> 02:20:24.260
Like if they want to take him to court for a deadline of a dolphin,

2369
02:20:24.530 --> 02:20:26.940
they would say we would like to take you back to the AP

2370
02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:29.830
<v 5>for all 2011 pots.
You indeed say I wanted to do,</v>

2371
02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:34.420
let's being inside their assholes.
Oh my God,
I can't remember that.

2372
02:20:34.421 --> 02:20:39.421
I think that was uploaded a new tube for your honor play time.

2373
02:20:39.790 --> 02:20:42.370
I bought the Kodak picture CD so they wouldn't have it.

2374
02:20:42.660 --> 02:20:47.660
<v 0>So the principle behind this guy's idea of sperm wars is that somehow under</v>

2375
02:20:48.850 --> 02:20:52.720
their sperm are competing for them,
you know,
for dominant again,

2376
02:20:52.930 --> 02:20:56.010
and at some sperm were sent into a kilo the sperm,

2377
02:20:56.460 --> 02:21:01.460
but according to most interpretations of the Work Online,

2378
02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:05.910
what they're saying is that this is really like shitty research and that they,

2379
02:21:05.911 --> 02:21:09.420
they can't really prove that sperm serve any other function other than

2380
02:21:09.570 --> 02:21:12.630
penetrating the egg.
And then some sperm just died.

2381
02:21:12.631 --> 02:21:17.460
And like it's just bad research.
Rarely.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And there's,
there's never,

2382
02:21:17.540 --> 02:21:20.550
they haven't shown here is a perfect one.

2383
02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:25.880
No evidence for a killer sperm or other selective interactions between human

2384
02:21:26.071 --> 02:21:31.071
spirit Zoma and in Spermatozoa in ejaculates of different males in vitro.

2385
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:35.130
So there's no evidence of,
uh,

2386
02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:39.120
them actually trying to kill each other inside there,
which makes sense.
Like,

2387
02:21:39.121 --> 02:21:42.900
how could sperm be so complex that can not only impregnate someone,

2388
02:21:42.901 --> 02:21:46.470
which is incredibly complex like conveyors of a genome.
Right.

2389
02:21:46.471 --> 02:21:51.050
And then also they can kill like,
come on.
You got to say it's good idea.
Yeah.

2390
02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:56.640
It's a good idea like for to write a book,
but it doesn't make sense.

2391
02:21:56.700 --> 02:22:00.000
But neither does anything.
He's his eyesight.
How does,

2392
02:22:00.310 --> 02:22:03.360
how does deal ability to smell farts?
How does that make sense?

2393
02:22:04.080 --> 02:22:08.670
You can't see him smell.
This doesn't make sense.
How can you hear something?

2394
02:22:08.910 --> 02:22:12.630
It's not even there.
Like what is it you're hearing?
What does it mean?

2395
02:22:12.690 --> 02:22:16.110
I'm not sure.
It doesn't make sense,
but it's real hearing things.

2396
02:22:16.410 --> 02:22:21.000
The idea that you can tell in what direction you just drag that Jack Daniels

2397
02:22:21.001 --> 02:22:24.720
bottle across the table.
I could tell by my hearing that doesn't make sense.

2398
02:22:25.290 --> 02:22:28.950
Nothing makes sense.
Am I right?
Right.
Big bottle.

2399
02:22:29.010 --> 02:22:31.920
How much talking shit could be both,

2400
02:22:32.820 --> 02:22:34.980
but I don't think this killer sperm thing is real.

2401
02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:40.620
<v 1>You,
when you were in this round Moriarty,
I wish it was true.
I believe in it</v>

2402
02:22:42.330 --> 02:22:47.070
more than big foot.
Do you believe in it more than Scientology?
Uh,
no.

2403
02:22:47.071 --> 02:22:49.020
Santana,
Jay,
he's legit.
If you have money,

2404
02:22:49.021 --> 02:22:51.990
you can buy rankings and some fake church thing.

2405
02:22:51.991 --> 02:22:55.970
You don't believe in big foot or Raul.
Hmm.
You don't believe in big trouble?
No,

2406
02:22:55.980 --> 02:22:58.080
I don't believe in big foot.
That's the dumbest shit ever.

2407
02:22:58.500 --> 02:23:01.710
I mean Lik look at Charlie Sheen with his little Naknek lochness monster shit.

2408
02:23:02.550 --> 02:23:04.670
Yeah.
He just went down to go find the lochness monster.

2409
02:23:04.690 --> 02:23:06.090
Guess why he didn't find it?
Yeah.

2410
02:23:06.270 --> 02:23:11.030
They must have good crack at the bottom of the ocean looking for,
you know,

2411
02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:11.970
it sounds cooler.

2412
02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:16.470
I believe that there is that Godzilla that sounds cooler hides behind the island

2413
02:23:16.471 --> 02:23:18.990
or something.
That makes sense.
Pride go slip.
No.

2414
02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:21.670
Like that makes more sense than fucking big than bigfoot.

2415
02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:24.810
Why does that make less sentence?
Why?
Yeah.

2416
02:23:24.811 --> 02:23:27.480
Tell me just as a complete outsider,

2417
02:23:27.540 --> 02:23:30.900
because like it's been already been half the big old,
big foot,
uh,

2418
02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:34.860
like videos and stuff.
I've already been disproven that it's been just hoaxes,

2419
02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:36.510
you know?
And it's just,

2420
02:23:36.511 --> 02:23:40.320
everyone's just trying to make this bullshit thing be real when it really,

2421
02:23:40.321 --> 02:23:43.680
it's just a bunch of hoaxes.
Well,
there's definitely a lot of hoax.
I mean,
yeah,

2422
02:23:43.681 --> 02:23:45.210
there might be a monkey that lives in the woods,

2423
02:23:45.211 --> 02:23:47.250
but that's not the big foot that everyone else is talking about.

2424
02:23:47.251 --> 02:23:48.750
And when I was just talking about all these hoaxes,

2425
02:23:48.751 --> 02:23:51.430
so like to believe and then put to those two things together,
it's just,

2426
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:53.130
it's just like,
all right,
move on.

2427
02:23:53.610 --> 02:23:55.560
Let's worry about something else that's real like aids.

2428
02:23:55.740 --> 02:23:56.610
<v 0>Well,
I'll tell you what,</v>

2429
02:23:56.640 --> 02:24:01.110
like I'm doing this show that I've been doing and actually go in and looking for

2430
02:24:01.111 --> 02:24:01.944
bigfoot.

2431
02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:06.660
I hear you 100% but I also go,

2432
02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:12.920
the weirdest thing about looking for bigfoot is I went into it semi seriously.

2433
02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:17.370
I went into it for the sci fi show and my idea was that,
you know what,
man,

2434
02:24:17.700 --> 02:24:22.140
I really would like for bigfoot to be real.
Jane Goodall says,
Big Foot's real.

2435
02:24:22.380 --> 02:24:25.980
I mean,
she really believes she believes 100% she's absolutely sure there's an

2436
02:24:25.981 --> 02:24:28.950
undiscovered primate said by the uniformity of the sightings,

2437
02:24:28.951 --> 02:24:32.970
by the fact that gigantic Pythagoras was a real animal that mimic the size,

2438
02:24:33.150 --> 02:24:35.010
shape,
the fact that it was by bipedal.

2439
02:24:35.011 --> 02:24:37.380
It lived as recently as a hundred thousand years ago,

2440
02:24:37.381 --> 02:24:40.440
and this is just the bones that they found.
They didn't even find those bones.

2441
02:24:40.441 --> 02:24:43.410
So the 1920 so it leaves a giant window of possibility.

2442
02:24:43.890 --> 02:24:46.380
Then you'd go there and I'm telling you,
man,

2443
02:24:46.530 --> 02:24:51.480
you go to the Pacific northwest and you walk around,
you go,
oh,

2444
02:24:51.690 --> 02:24:56.250
no one knows what's up here.
I mean,
you get out there.

2445
02:24:56.280 --> 02:24:58.530
We went to mount Rainier and we went into the woods.

2446
02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:02.010
You just take a road into the woods.
It's a dirt road.
You go a couple miles down,

2447
02:25:02.011 --> 02:25:03.240
and that's what we started to make camp.

2448
02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:06.480
And you go off into the woods from there,
you're in another dimension.

2449
02:25:06.481 --> 02:25:08.640
You're going to God damn avatar movie.
I mean,

2450
02:25:08.670 --> 02:25:13.470
and it goes on for thousands and thousands of square miles.

2451
02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:17.220
<v 1>I bet there's a lot of people walking those woods.
Hi.
And</v>

2452
02:25:17.220 --> 02:25:18.760
<v 0>I'm telling you,
the d,</v>

2453
02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:22.680
The penetration by human beings is extremely limited.

2454
02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:24.610
You'd have to go there to understand it.

2455
02:25:24.830 --> 02:25:28.210
I joked around about it before we actually went there,
but once I,

2456
02:25:28.480 --> 02:25:31.210
once I was actually there and Duncan and I went wandering through the woods,

2457
02:25:31.211 --> 02:25:35.810
we were like,
oh,
well nobody knows what the fuck is up here.
Like literally you,

2458
02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:40.920
we sent these drones with cameras above the woods to get a view and you're

2459
02:25:41.351 --> 02:25:46.300
talking about just an insane like to the horizon as far as you can see and no

2460
02:25:46.301 --> 02:25:49.750
one's there.
It's just dense trees like a box of Q tips.

2461
02:25:50.110 --> 02:25:54.790
It sounds so silly that there's a crazy monkey living in the woods.

2462
02:25:54.791 --> 02:25:59.320
It sounds so silly,
but the reality is no one knows what the fuck is out there.

2463
02:25:59.350 --> 02:26:01.000
So why again,

2464
02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:05.410
you like chimps and gorillas so much and no,
sorry.

2465
02:26:05.410 --> 02:26:09.010
Hate them so much,
but love.
I know I don't,
I don't hate any of them.

2466
02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:12.950
I don't hate the champion.
I'm freaked out by our freight terrify them,

2467
02:26:12.990 --> 02:26:15.610
but obsessed with big foot and Werewolf's.
Well,
it's also,

2468
02:26:15.611 --> 02:26:17.920
I know that human beings are dangerous.
I know,

2469
02:26:17.921 --> 02:26:21.070
I know a lot of dangerous human beings.
Physically dangerous,
mentally dangerous.

2470
02:26:21.071 --> 02:26:22.870
There's human beings can be very dangerous.

2471
02:26:23.170 --> 02:26:26.290
So the potential for destruction and trying to manage and mitigate that,

2472
02:26:26.291 --> 02:26:27.400
it's fascinating to me.

2473
02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:30.640
And then you see something that takes it to a complete different level,

2474
02:26:30.641 --> 02:26:33.500
like a gorilla.
And how about Sasquatch?
Well,

2475
02:26:33.530 --> 02:26:36.550
but this was what I was going to say.
One of the fascinating things is about,

2476
02:26:36.551 --> 02:26:40.360
they're obviously not as smart as us.
So,
and what are they get instead?
Well,

2477
02:26:40.361 --> 02:26:44.410
they get the ability to swing from branch to branch and fly from tree to tree.

2478
02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:46.900
That's what a chimp cats.
What does it gorilla get?
Well,

2479
02:26:46.901 --> 02:26:49.150
he gets to lie on the ground cause he doesn't give a fuck.

2480
02:26:49.151 --> 02:26:53.170
He's not worried about Jaguars.
Jaguars best step the fuck away from a gorilla.

2481
02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:56.440
Nobody wants to fuck with a gorilla.
Lions don't want to fuck with the gorilla.

2482
02:26:56.441 --> 02:26:59.560
Elephants don't want to fuck with the gorilla.
They look at it and they go,

2483
02:26:59.561 --> 02:27:02.530
oh Jesus Christ,
let's just go over here.
That's what they do.

2484
02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:05.080
So I think there's that.
You know,
there's the,
the,

2485
02:27:05.081 --> 02:27:09.490
there's this idea that there's this weird sort of balanced to the world and

2486
02:27:09.491 --> 02:27:12.970
these dumb motherfuckers heating water roots and pulling them out.

2487
02:27:13.090 --> 02:27:15.100
They had the strongest things I've ever lived.

2488
02:27:15.280 --> 02:27:17.850
If you have it like a gorilla football team,
that could,

2489
02:27:18.010 --> 02:27:21.550
that fucking team would be undefeated throughout human history.
Sasquatch.

2490
02:27:21.970 --> 02:27:25.780
I love all of it.
I'm,
I'm,
look,
I'm fascinated by everything.
They can kill me.

2491
02:27:27.760 --> 02:27:31.810
Everything that's dangerous.
Everything that's,
that's wild.

2492
02:27:31.811 --> 02:27:33.940
Cause I think that we're too used to these things.

2493
02:27:34.300 --> 02:27:36.520
We just accept the fact I went to the zoo recently.

2494
02:27:36.610 --> 02:27:39.980
I was in Colorado like this entry or limes tick.

2495
02:27:40.140 --> 02:27:44.140
I'm scared of all that shit to Lyme disease is terrifying,
man.

2496
02:27:44.170 --> 02:27:48.520
I tweeted something about Lyme disease recently.
Lyme disease is fairly recent.

2497
02:27:48.820 --> 02:27:52.720
It's only been the last few decades that people have either been diagnosed by

2498
02:27:52.721 --> 02:27:53.980
this or contracted this.

2499
02:27:53.981 --> 02:27:58.070
But Lyme disease is terrifying and it's also been connected to more Jelonese.

2500
02:27:58.290 --> 02:28:03.290
No more gel is this crazy disease where you have these fibers growing out of

2501
02:28:03.971 --> 02:28:08.140
your party.
It's been connected to hyperkeratinization but that's what's,

2502
02:28:08.170 --> 02:28:12.040
that's what's terrifying to me is that shit.
Yeah,
it's horrifying.
Well,

2503
02:28:12.041 --> 02:28:15.730
the flu is hard.
This is all stuff that we're covering on,
on my new show too.

2504
02:28:15.731 --> 02:28:20.200
There's a,
there's a whole episode on diseases and the idea of these,
these,

2505
02:28:20.260 --> 02:28:24.450
these are 28 days later type scenarios,
right?

2506
02:28:24.910 --> 02:28:29.690
How possible is it is bioterrorism,
I own martyrs.
The idea that someone can,

2507
02:28:29.770 --> 02:28:30.140
you know,

2508
02:28:30.140 --> 02:28:33.470
give someone a disease and send him on a plane if these are all things that are

2509
02:28:33.471 --> 02:28:38.471
being considered like I am not in any way shape or form in support of the

2510
02:28:38.991 --> 02:28:40.640
government of being able to read your emails.

2511
02:28:40.641 --> 02:28:44.660
If you read the whole thing is just Douche tastic but if you really thought

2512
02:28:44.690 --> 02:28:48.500
there was some 28 days later shit coming or the potential of stopping it was

2513
02:28:48.501 --> 02:28:53.050
only achieved through monitoring everything,
you know,

2514
02:28:53.080 --> 02:28:54.290
you'd be interested in doing it.

2515
02:28:54.620 --> 02:28:58.350
<v 5>Sure.
I just think that the problem is,
is you,</v>

2516
02:28:58.550 --> 02:29:03.550
the result is the sort of bureaucrats with just what I'm going to call amounts

2517
02:29:04.050 --> 02:29:07.610
of power.
Of course,
of course,
and it's always been a problem.

2518
02:29:07.640 --> 02:29:10.580
At some point you have to say whether it has to be some sort of privacy,

2519
02:29:10.581 --> 02:29:13.490
there has to be some sort of democracy.

2520
02:29:13.491 --> 02:29:17.450
There has to be some sort of something and and and sure like they should get

2521
02:29:17.451 --> 02:29:19.400
better at,
at,
at data gathering,

2522
02:29:19.401 --> 02:29:24.210
but they shouldn't watch all of our shit all the time.
It's also like who's who

2523
02:29:24.290 --> 02:29:28.890
<v 0>gets to do this?
Like are these regular people?
I think the most moral of,</v>

2524
02:29:28.970 --> 02:29:29.930
of all of us,

2525
02:29:29.931 --> 02:29:34.931
if they've been proven to be the most qualified to sort of dispense knowledge.

2526
02:29:36.890 --> 02:29:38.830
<v 5>I have a gambling that August,</v>

2527
02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:42.200
go talk to this guy because I know everything about this shit.
Yeah,

2528
02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:44.950
it might be that.
Yeah,
I need 20 grand dude.
I bet

2529
02:29:46.450 --> 02:29:49.860
people are people they're going to do shit but,

2530
02:29:50.750 --> 02:29:52.970
but some people know everything about other people.

2531
02:29:53.060 --> 02:29:57.920
<v 0>But I think that I,
I'm,
I'm certainly not in favor of all this happening,</v>

2532
02:29:58.100 --> 02:30:02.210
but what I,
what I am and what I am excited about is the debate.

2533
02:30:02.780 --> 02:30:07.780
I'm excited about the debate of information distribution of information and the

2534
02:30:07.881 --> 02:30:12.881
discussion on possibilities of controlling it and if there are even viable

2535
02:30:12.990 --> 02:30:15.620
because that becomes a real,
I think that becomes a real question.

2536
02:30:15.650 --> 02:30:18.950
So what do you think of Snowden?
I don't know.
I have these Wa I,

2537
02:30:18.980 --> 02:30:23.810
my idea is very wildly and none of 'em are substantial like substantiate double

2538
02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:28.060
whatever that word is.
You can't,
you can't.
Um,

2539
02:30:28.100 --> 02:30:31.820
I I think you can't really make an accurate prognosis.

2540
02:30:31.821 --> 02:30:35.330
I think there's a lot of people that are viewing what this exponential course of

2541
02:30:35.400 --> 02:30:36.380
technology's going to take us

2542
02:30:36.590 --> 02:30:39.610
<v 5>but also one directly like Wiki,</v>

2543
02:30:39.640 --> 02:30:42.490
wiki leaks versus non wiki leaks.
So,

2544
02:30:42.610 --> 02:30:47.610
so they leaked it and we know but it's weakening us but they leaked it and we

2545
02:30:47.861 --> 02:30:50.710
know more.
And actually it started this whole nother thing.

2546
02:30:51.230 --> 02:30:55.790
<v 0>I'm going to take it to a even crazier level.
I think bunny itself,</v>

2547
02:30:55.820 --> 02:30:56.870
it's going to be invalid.

2548
02:30:57.080 --> 02:30:59.930
I think we're going to reach a point in time where information is so freely

2549
02:30:59.931 --> 02:31:02.750
distributed that money is essentially information at this point.

2550
02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:06.860
Ones and Zeros accumulated on hard drives and databases.

2551
02:31:07.040 --> 02:31:10.610
They don't really mean anything anymore.
We're not,
it's not like $1 as well.

2552
02:31:10.611 --> 02:31:14.630
One paper note is one pound of gold.
It doesn't mean that anymore.
Right?

2553
02:31:14.690 --> 02:31:18.920
So you're in this weird stage where everything is digital and the trend seems to

2554
02:31:18.930 --> 02:31:20.280
be,
at least to me,

2555
02:31:20.281 --> 02:31:25.281
to the uneducated trying to follow the trend seems to be for a dissolving of all

2556
02:31:25.561 --> 02:31:30.300
the barriers between people and information.
And if money becomes information,

2557
02:31:30.301 --> 02:31:32.250
which is what it is,
it's just ones and Zeros.

2558
02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:36.990
How are you going to stop people from controlling and may be dispensing that
one,

2559
02:31:37.020 --> 02:31:38.310
those ones and Zeros.

2560
02:31:38.460 --> 02:31:42.600
And if something comes along during that process of,
of,

2561
02:31:42.601 --> 02:31:44.400
of confusion,
of integration,

2562
02:31:44.490 --> 02:31:48.870
if something comes along that sorta redistributes people's competitive edges and

2563
02:31:48.871 --> 02:31:52.530
turns him into a social thing and it says,
listen,
the money thing,

2564
02:31:52.531 --> 02:31:53.520
what we're going to do with the bunny thing,

2565
02:31:53.521 --> 02:31:57.930
let's just like sort of evenly spread it out.
Like that's a real possibility.

2566
02:31:58.020 --> 02:32:03.000
And what do you think of Bitcoin then?
Um,
I don't know too much about it.

2567
02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:06.240
I don't know about how secure it is,

2568
02:32:06.850 --> 02:32:08.610
how much it can be manipulated.

2569
02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:13.790
I wonder if idealistic people who get involved in some sort of a counterculture

2570
02:32:14.130 --> 02:32:15.510
currency,
how much,

2571
02:32:15.660 --> 02:32:19.020
how much can that currency be manipulated by someone who truly understands

2572
02:32:19.021 --> 02:32:19.854
finances?

2573
02:32:20.130 --> 02:32:24.580
How much of it can be just a new pawn in a new game that we fuck up and we hack

2574
02:32:24.581 --> 02:32:29.130
the new PAC man so it's like shut it down.
Yeah.
Well could be that too.

2575
02:32:30.060 --> 02:32:32.550
They could sabotage it.
They can tank it.

2576
02:32:32.850 --> 02:32:35.760
There's a lot of weirdness to any sort of a new currency.

2577
02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:39.750
But it's exciting that someone's willing to entertain the possibility for sure.

2578
02:32:40.020 --> 02:32:40.291
You know?

2579
02:32:40.291 --> 02:32:44.910
But it's scary too because the people that are in control of this world and not

2580
02:32:44.911 --> 02:32:47.520
going to let go lightly,
that's the problem.

2581
02:32:47.960 --> 02:32:49.050
<v 5>That's why we need to get them.</v>

2582
02:32:50.390 --> 02:32:54.020
She didn't trust Xbox live currency more than a bitcoin.
You know,

2583
02:32:55.040 --> 02:32:59.870
like I really trust it more than I can do to keep my money.
Xbox live points.

2584
02:32:59.900 --> 02:33:03.590
Yeah.
The big coin is like,
man,
where's that going to go?
I don't know.
I hold,

2585
02:33:03.591 --> 02:33:07.210
the problem with it is that it's,
you know,

2586
02:33:07.430 --> 02:33:11.060
obviously an alternative currency.
So people are using it for different shit.

2587
02:33:11.180 --> 02:33:14.840
And they're saying,
well,
how long until they shut them down.
But they're saying,

2588
02:33:14.841 --> 02:33:17.720
well,
we're going to operate in such a way that you can't shut us down.

2589
02:33:19.700 --> 02:33:21.260
Well,
it's,
it's very interesting.

2590
02:33:21.580 --> 02:33:25.060
<v 0>Anything that happens on the Internet where,
you know,
you go all anonymousy,</v>

2591
02:33:25.270 --> 02:33:29.470
he'd go all free ball and you go out there bitcoin,
you know,
he just,

2592
02:33:29.630 --> 02:33:32.920
he realized that these people are coalescing and they have these ideas and make

2593
02:33:32.921 --> 02:33:37.630
your plans,
okay,
here's a new currency.
Oh boy,
what happens now?

2594
02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:41.050
What is it doing?
When is someone going to just say,
hey,
let's all meet in Sweden.

2595
02:33:41.290 --> 02:33:44.800
We got to a spot.
It's thousand acres.
Let's start building houses.
I mean,

2596
02:33:44.801 --> 02:33:46.600
that's like,
that's one of those things.

2597
02:33:46.601 --> 02:33:50.490
So I think has happened throughout human history.
There's this,

2598
02:33:50.500 --> 02:33:55.450
the reason why America exists and these people that are like so pro-america but

2599
02:33:55.451 --> 02:33:59.650
anti change have to understand there's only one reason why this spot is

2600
02:33:59.651 --> 02:34:03.730
populated by white people.
That's because England sucked.

2601
02:34:03.970 --> 02:34:06.640
It was fucking terrible.
It was a mess.

2602
02:34:06.700 --> 02:34:09.310
And it had gotten to this breaking point where people are like,

2603
02:34:09.311 --> 02:34:12.160
we gotta get the fuck out.
We got to risk our lives to get on a boat.

2604
02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:16.870
We have to get through the ocean and survive plague.
We have to get over there.

2605
02:34:17.020 --> 02:34:18.670
This is not going to work anymore.

2606
02:34:19.210 --> 02:34:23.110
And that that's a trend that created,
in my opinion,

2607
02:34:23.111 --> 02:34:27.790
is the greatest nation the world has ever known and that trend needs to continue

2608
02:34:27.890 --> 02:34:30.730
and it doesn't mean it's bad for the people in power.

2609
02:34:31.060 --> 02:34:35.350
It just means they have to understand that growth has to be achieved and we have

2610
02:34:35.351 --> 02:34:36.220
to move on.

2611
02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:41.200
And when things are illuminated that show very clearly that there's an equities

2612
02:34:41.201 --> 02:34:44.770
and things were all wrong,
they have to be corrected.
You can still make money.

2613
02:34:44.950 --> 02:34:48.040
Everybody can make money,
just cut the shit.
And you know,

2614
02:34:48.041 --> 02:34:51.460
you got to understand what's moral and what's ethical and what's not.

2615
02:34:51.461 --> 02:34:53.590
And when things become really transparent,

2616
02:34:53.710 --> 02:34:57.550
you can't get away with just fucking putting bulletproof vests on people and

2617
02:34:57.551 --> 02:35:00.850
sending them out with guns.
You've got to come up with the answers.
You got to,

2618
02:35:00.860 --> 02:35:03.970
you got to tell people,
yeah,
I know word control,

2619
02:35:03.971 --> 02:35:06.580
but we're trying to evolve as well.
We're growing as well.

2620
02:35:06.581 --> 02:35:09.430
We're human beings as well.
We've made mistakes.
We're on a bad path.

2621
02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:14.580
We've been following the momentum of Barbera's people from the beginning of time

2622
02:35:14.741 --> 02:35:17.770
to today,
and maybe we didn't realize the repercussions of our actions.

2623
02:35:17.771 --> 02:35:21.070
The fact that we would perhaps be even happier if we didn't engage in them,

2624
02:35:22.120 --> 02:35:25.330
and then slowly the dust settles.

2625
02:35:25.900 --> 02:35:27.220
That's the rosy picture.

2626
02:35:27.970 --> 02:35:32.020
That's the rosy picture of humanity is the crazy monkeys meet in the middle of

2627
02:35:32.021 --> 02:35:34.930
the street and he'd go,
all right,
we don't need to do this anymore.
Right?
Okay,

2628
02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:39.400
how do I don't want,
this is not making me happy.
Find another fucking outlet.

2629
02:35:39.430 --> 02:35:40.510
Finding an outlet for that.

2630
02:35:40.511 --> 02:35:42.760
All those assholes that are out there blowing up the world,

2631
02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:46.060
they need you Jitsu in their lives.
They need to go around Shogun people,

2632
02:35:46.150 --> 02:35:48.550
you know,
they need to take a [inaudible] class,
get their ass kicked,

2633
02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:51.610
stop trying to dominate the planet.
That's just ridiculous.

2634
02:35:53.500 --> 02:35:56.460
Can't let some preaching right there.
If I wasn't me,

2635
02:35:56.470 --> 02:36:00.670
I'd download this podcast and deleted immediately.
I certain point in time,

2636
02:36:00.940 --> 02:36:04.330
we all know this.
I know you notice somebody doesn't know that though.

2637
02:36:04.720 --> 02:36:05.291
That's the problem.

2638
02:36:05.291 --> 02:36:08.800
Sure if they did know it and it's not happening at a certain point in time when

2639
02:36:08.801 --> 02:36:11.440
you say things that you would like to happen,
but they don't have,
when people go,

2640
02:36:11.441 --> 02:36:15.670
we focused on with your utopian bullshit.
I don't think it's a bad idea.

2641
02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:17.980
I think it's a bad idea to be nice to each other.

2642
02:36:18.010 --> 02:36:21.460
They don't think it's a bad idea to figure out a better way to control the

2643
02:36:21.461 --> 02:36:24.580
resources of the world.
That's because,
you know,
you grow up,

2644
02:36:24.581 --> 02:36:27.820
you're older and you're like,
you know,
let's not just fight.
Let's just,
hey,

2645
02:36:28.270 --> 02:36:31.600
but could you imagine,
can you imagine if you were the head of like,
you know,

2646
02:36:31.690 --> 02:36:36.690
some gigantic oil company or some huge bank and you're just making just on godly

2647
02:36:38.411 --> 02:36:39.640
sums of cash.

2648
02:36:39.790 --> 02:36:43.960
Like you're strapped onto a roller coaster and you're flying down through a

2649
02:36:43.961 --> 02:36:48.880
river of million dollar bills just covering you constantly.

2650
02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:51.640
You're absorbing money every second of the day.

2651
02:36:51.641 --> 02:36:56.641
Just constantly buying Mercedes and Bentleys and private jets and getting your

2652
02:36:56.711 --> 02:37:01.711
Dick sucked and it's almost entirely intoxicating and impossible to get off that

2653
02:37:02.231 --> 02:37:06.130
ride.
Is that right?
It's so fun.
Have no one,

2654
02:37:06.310 --> 02:37:08.170
no one questions you.
You're walking around,

2655
02:37:08.171 --> 02:37:11.410
you have a million butlers and you just tell everybody what the fuck to do and

2656
02:37:11.990 --> 02:37:15.490
getting your jet and you fly to Paris and you do whatever you want.
That's,

2657
02:37:15.530 --> 02:37:16.370
that's,
that's

2658
02:37:16.370 --> 02:37:19.550
<v 2>the people that have the most money in this world.
That's where they're at.</v>

2659
02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:23.390
They're at this ridiculous position where no one should have ever let them get

2660
02:37:23.391 --> 02:37:27.080
to the point where they can have a boat that's 700 feet long.
Like what happened?

2661
02:37:27.081 --> 02:37:30.620
They're like,
what did you do?
You move numbers around.
That's how you got a boat.

2662
02:37:30.980 --> 02:37:34.530
Did you even sell anything?
Hold on.
Oh,
who's making the most out of it?

2663
02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:37.720
<v 5>But it's a lot like India where you said earlier on the show,</v>

2664
02:37:37.721 --> 02:37:41.170
like there's a a billion and a half dollar house coming out of a slum.

2665
02:37:41.171 --> 02:37:44.320
Why aren't they fucking say no,
no,
we'll be taking this now.

2666
02:37:44.321 --> 02:37:48.700
This will be our shit.
And it's the same thing here.
It's like,
okay,
you know,

2667
02:37:49.170 --> 02:37:52.840
as a guy who does a hedge fund,
who's hedging against the economy,

2668
02:37:53.350 --> 02:37:55.450
who has a 400 foot yacht,

2669
02:37:57.030 --> 02:37:59.940
<v 2>okay,
I know it's credit against us.
Well,</v>

2670
02:37:59.941 --> 02:38:03.990
he figured out a way to manipulate the system and extract money in some weird

2671
02:38:03.991 --> 02:38:07.320
way.
It's legal,
you know,
and he's allowed to like be a baller.

2672
02:38:08.130 --> 02:38:10.560
I mean the guy in India,
how did he make all that money?
What does he doing?

2673
02:38:11.880 --> 02:38:15.150
But I certainly think that the Indian way of dealing with it is more appealing

2674
02:38:15.151 --> 02:38:18.830
for sure.
I will just go,
oh,
that's what he did.
You know?
I don't think the,

2675
02:38:18.831 --> 02:38:21.940
the way to do it is to write it up every time someone has more than you to try

2676
02:38:21.941 --> 02:38:26.040
to steal their Robin with their shit.
Yeah.
That doesn't work either.

2677
02:38:26.310 --> 02:38:27.960
It doesn't work.
What does work,

2678
02:38:27.961 --> 02:38:30.330
Shane Smith and all the years you've seen on advice,

2679
02:38:31.260 --> 02:38:35.730
what do you think works the best system in this country and this world rather

2680
02:38:37.770 --> 02:38:38.603
I in Canada?

2681
02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:43.360
<v 5>No,
I mean anywhere where you make a lot of money,
it's going to be okay.</v>

2682
02:38:43.390 --> 02:38:45.940
That's the best system.
Yeah.
Like,
if you go to Switzerland,

2683
02:38:46.030 --> 02:38:49.590
everything's great and works and is clean and nice and Germany,

2684
02:38:49.840 --> 02:38:50.890
toilets and stuff.
Yeah.

2685
02:38:50.891 --> 02:38:54.310
But Switzerland in particular because it's small and it's rich.

2686
02:38:54.850 --> 02:38:58.330
So like if you go to a toilet there,
it's awesome.
If you go to like,
you know,

2687
02:38:58.380 --> 02:39:01.820
and you know,
I need something and whatever,
that's awesome.

2688
02:39:02.310 --> 02:39:06.040
Health care or whatever,
but you know,
it's smaller than rich.

2689
02:39:06.070 --> 02:39:10.930
That's the thing is smaller,
which is good.
Yeah.
Well if you're gonna,

2690
02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:15.430
if you're going to pay,
you know,
for,
for those things,
for public benefit,

2691
02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:20.090
<v 2>it has to be rich.
Yeah.
Um,
the,
the,</v>

2692
02:39:20.140 --> 02:39:22.840
so you think like European countries like Switzerland,
like,

2693
02:39:22.980 --> 02:39:25.470
<v 5>oh,
well,
I mean,
I mean what I'm saying is this,</v>

2694
02:39:25.471 --> 02:39:29.820
those countries are like where you see something that works like it works

2695
02:39:30.300 --> 02:39:34.050
because it costs a lot of money to make it work.
And if you,
when it doesn't work,

2696
02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:36.240
when you go to countries that don't have a lot of money,

2697
02:39:36.241 --> 02:39:37.890
the system doesn't work because it breaks down.
Yeah.

2698
02:39:38.540 --> 02:39:38.931
<v 2>There's a,</v>

2699
02:39:38.931 --> 02:39:41.820
there's an also a debate in this country about how difficult it is getting to

2700
02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:44.240
Canada.
And I've talked to my friends about this and I'm like,

2701
02:39:44.420 --> 02:39:47.090
I think it's good if you're running a great country like Canada,

2702
02:39:47.091 --> 02:39:51.770
you would you want people to come in that have had it was a lot easier in Canada

2703
02:39:51.771 --> 02:39:55.010
than in America.
Is that I think,
I don't know because I only know one way,

2704
02:39:55.130 --> 02:39:58.010
but I know that a candidate won't let you in if you have a Dui.

2705
02:39:58.580 --> 02:40:00.680
I have friends that have a Dui.
They can't get into Canada.

2706
02:40:00.690 --> 02:40:03.290
That's the same with states,
is it?
Yeah,
it makes sense.

2707
02:40:03.291 --> 02:40:06.110
Any criminal record you can't think that makes sense.

2708
02:40:06.700 --> 02:40:11.200
So they're fairly equal,
but so smaller,
richer countries where where?

2709
02:40:11.210 --> 02:40:12.160
Where like Switzerland,

2710
02:40:12.170 --> 02:40:16.140
where they get their money from felt bank to make knives to me.

2711
02:40:16.141 --> 02:40:19.620
Cool night training,
make good cheese.
Whether they do it for money,

2712
02:40:22.780 --> 02:40:26.640
they make an all right.
What is a swindlers?
Okay,
we're going to move,

2713
02:40:26.641 --> 02:40:29.130
wrap the site.
I don't think you guys have to get you out of here.

2714
02:40:29.490 --> 02:40:33.510
Do you have something else to do?
You do something else tonight.
Sorry.
Yeah.

2715
02:40:33.540 --> 02:40:36.540
How are they going to deal with the fact that you're all fucked up?
Uh,

2716
02:40:36.670 --> 02:40:38.640
they're used to it.
That's what I'm saying.

2717
02:40:40.330 --> 02:40:44.400
<v 5>Yeah.
I'm like,
yeah,
I gotta go,
you know,
see my buddy.
And they're like,</v>

2718
02:40:44.401 --> 02:40:46.950
what are you doing?
Really?
And I'm like,
wow.
I have a friend.
Like,
you know,

2719
02:40:46.951 --> 02:40:49.830
I'm going to do,
oh,
I'm going to do Rogan.
And they're like,
oh,
you're not coming.

2720
02:40:50.580 --> 02:40:51.413
You're not going to make it.

2721
02:40:51.500 --> 02:40:53.780
<v 2>You're gonna make it.
You're not gonna,
everything's gonna be fine.</v>

2722
02:40:53.960 --> 02:40:57.470
People need you to relax.
But these silly things around our wrists,
okay,

2723
02:40:57.500 --> 02:40:59.120
these are just a suggestion.

2724
02:40:59.550 --> 02:41:01.640
A certain time and place when you get to a certain age,

2725
02:41:01.641 --> 02:41:04.550
if you really still have to listen to that,
you've made a mistake.
Okay.

2726
02:41:04.551 --> 02:41:06.620
At a certain point in time,
unless she's catching a flight,

2727
02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:11.000
those fucking things and they help you guy guy,
he got better.

2728
02:41:11.001 --> 02:41:12.200
They got people that have them.

2729
02:41:12.590 --> 02:41:15.350
That's even more baller than actually having a watch.

2730
02:41:15.351 --> 02:41:17.510
You have another dude who wears the watch.
You're like,

2731
02:41:17.511 --> 02:41:20.690
I don't want to be burdened by metal.
That's true.

2732
02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:25.640
Tell me when my meeting arises so I can collect more ones and Zeros.

2733
02:41:25.850 --> 02:41:30.380
Watch Kenny Martin.
Yeah,
there you go.
Makes Sense.

2734
02:41:30.500 --> 02:41:34.490
Kids got knowledge dude.
Um,
look,

2735
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:37.700
Whoever your friend was that we called in the last podcast and apparently I was

2736
02:41:37.701 --> 02:41:39.920
drunk and I said rude things to him that I didn't really mean.

2737
02:41:40.310 --> 02:41:44.750
It was just for the sake of comedy fellow.
Who Was it?

2738

We were,

2739
02:41:49.250 --> 02:41:50.660
we were so lit up at the next day.

2740
02:41:50.661 --> 02:41:53.660
I wasn't really sure that I remembered it even happening.

2741
02:41:54.230 --> 02:41:58.040
Thought maybe someone was trying to suggest some shit and plant some false

2742
02:41:58.041 --> 02:42:01.520
memories.
One of my favorite podcasts of all time.
