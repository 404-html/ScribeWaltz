00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:06.523
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.860
<v Speaker 2>before we even get started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to give a shout out to this dude,</v>

3
00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:12.910
<v Speaker 2>Aaron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is it?</v>

<v Speaker 2>but he gave us that.</v>

6
00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:16.540
<v Speaker 2>But the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the white snake,</v>

7
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.630
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>

8
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.720
<v Speaker 2>I told the story a long time ago about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>car accident and I got into when I had</v>

9
00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:23.890
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had an older girlfriend.</v>

10
00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:26.530
<v Speaker 2>He's telling me what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty hot though,</v>

11
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Stephanie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you?</v>

12
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she,</v>

13
00:00:29.381 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she made me throw away this whitesnake</v>

14
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.430
<v Speaker 2>cassette after the car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a little box of cassettes in my</v>

15
00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:39.790
<v Speaker 2>car and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw that out and that's fucking listen</v>

16
00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:40.870
<v Speaker 2>to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

17
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.330
<v Speaker 2>So if you're in that state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in that situation right now,</v>

18
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.750
<v Speaker 2>will your interrelationship and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>person you're with tells you what to do</v>

<v Speaker 2>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why was that bitch wants to,</v>

21
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.660

<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that I fucking threw out this whitesnake</v>
<v Speaker 2>cd wells cassette cassette,</v>

23
00:00:56.621 --> 00:00:58.870
<v Speaker 2>rather they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even have a CD player then</v>

24
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.070
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did they,</v>

25
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.690
<v Speaker 2>when did cds come out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Officially</v>

26
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 3>90,</v>
<v Speaker 3>80.</v>

27
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 3>I feel like we've done 88</v>

28
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.810
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure this out before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just don't,</v>

29
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.300
<v Speaker 2>it's just not worthy enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere in the 80 [inaudible]</v>

30
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.040
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early or late eighties,</v>

31
00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:14.260
<v Speaker 3>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I got my first one in,</v>

32
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.730
<v Speaker 3>I remember for my birthday when I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 16 or something like that.</v>

33
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.660
<v Speaker 3>17.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this had to be</v>

34
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.740
<v Speaker 2>b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a d eight.</v>

35
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.220
<v Speaker 2>Cause I know that after I broke up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

36
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I started fighting again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took like a break,</v>

37
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.930
<v Speaker 2>we broke up and then I have three more</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights after a date of her.</v>

38
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.423
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

39
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.430
<v Speaker 2>like kickboxing fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I remember the year,</v>

40
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'd had to be Ada,</v>

41
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.740
<v Speaker 2>which is 88 or 89.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But fucking,</v>

42
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.920
<v Speaker 2>I loved this cassette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was,</v>

43
00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:48.170
<v Speaker 2>that was like a real moment of for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

44
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.710
<v Speaker 2>there's moments when you haven't</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships where you'd go,</v>

45
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't be this guy.</v>

46
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.240
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't just let someone tell me what to</v>

47
00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:56.920
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And someone tried to change me.</v>

48
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.030
<v Speaker 2>Like she was a very smart girl and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>was older than me.</v>

49
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Like she was 25 and I was 21.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember,</v>

50
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was just smarter than me.</v>

51
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.220
<v Speaker 2>It lists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's certainly at the time more worldly</v>

52
00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:12.520
<v Speaker 2>than me and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just fucking listen to her.</v>

53
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.320
<v Speaker 2>It's not good man.</v>

54
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.930
<v Speaker 3>Don't you hate when you see your friends</v>
<v Speaker 3>in those situations though?</v>

55
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.380
<v Speaker 3>Like you see the friends that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that always fight every week and they're</v>

56
00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:21.640
<v Speaker 3>always breaking up in there.</v>

57
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's awful.</v>

58
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.250
<v Speaker 2>In her defense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a fucking idiot in her defense,</v>

59
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was trying to shape me up,</v>

60
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an interesting like,</v>

61
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:33.740
<v Speaker 2>you know what I knew I couldn't hang out</v>
<v Speaker 2>with her anymore,</v>

62
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.270
<v Speaker 2>was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was an incident at a comedy club</v>

63
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.550
<v Speaker 2>that I've told before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to repeat it again because</v>

64
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:43.040
<v Speaker 2>the person that I talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like [inaudible] talked about it in the</v>

65
00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Jamie Kilstein podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person I was talking about is</v>

66
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.810
<v Speaker 2>completely delusional and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>perception of these events,</v>

67
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to even rehash who the</v>
<v Speaker 2>original person was that I'd gotten this</v>

68
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:55.820
<v Speaker 2>dispute with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wound up walking off the stage</v>

69
00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 2>because I was disgusted by how this</v>
<v Speaker 2>professional comedian was censoring</v>

70
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:03.330
<v Speaker 2>people at an open mic night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

71
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 2>Stephanie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's,</v>

72
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

73
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Never anything but awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was very cool person.</v>

74
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 2>So I've never hated her or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she,</v>

75
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she pulled me aside and she like Kinda</v>

76
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 2>like lectured me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

77
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to do this,</v>

78
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 2>if you want to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have to really do it.</v>

79
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 2>You can't walk off stage like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's completely unprofessional.</v>

80
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a professional.</v>

81
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an amateur.</v>

82
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.961
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

83
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 2>it's unprofessional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to learn how to do it.</v>

84
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized like that's not how</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talk to people that are in your</v>

85
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you don't like what they're</v>

86
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have,</v>

87
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be a better way of</v>

88
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 2>approaching it than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her way of approaching it was from like</v>

89
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 2>a mother perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can authoritative perspective,</v>

90
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was weird.</v>

91
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 2>It was a weird relationship in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect.</v>

92
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 2>And when you see those relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is</v>

93
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to generalize,</v>

94
00:03:56.621 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 2>but oftentimes in relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dynamic that the relationship begins</v>

95
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 2>with is the dynamic the relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>sticks with.</v>

96
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 2>And if you get stuck in a relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>where one person is telling you what to</v>

97
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it very rarely goes back the other way.</v>

98
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.490
<v Speaker 2>And then you tell them what to do and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they listened.</v>

99
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 2>It never does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you develop like a chief and</v>

100
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:21.600
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the Indians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know there's a captain and then</v>

101
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 2>there's the sailors and it's just the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way it is.</v>

102
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why,</v>

103
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 2>but with her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like early on she assumed the role of</v>

104
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 2>the one who is like dictating what was</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay and not okay,</v>

105
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 2>what kind of music I should like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how I should dress.</v>

106
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.290
<v Speaker 2>It's real weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

107
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was a 25 year old girl dating a 21</v>

108
00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 2>year old guy who was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

109
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 2>when girls are 25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

110
00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:47.951
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>

111
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to marry this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have kids with this fucking</v>

112
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:50.790
<v Speaker 2>idiot.</v>

113
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.630
<v Speaker 3>I got to shape them up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got to get them to stop listening</v>

114
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:54.990
<v Speaker 3>to white snake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

115
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 3>I think I do that every almost every</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship though.</v>

116
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.690
<v Speaker 3>Like oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she uh,</v>

117
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then coincidentally you often dig,</v>

118
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.140
<v Speaker 3>always great girls younger than you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

119
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.410
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

120
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 3>Always and never fixable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like as hard as I tried.</v>

121
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.430
<v Speaker 3>Not that fix of all</v>

122
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.210
<v Speaker 2>21 to 25 is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

123
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.490
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem that old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for a guide.</v>

124
00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:18.620
<v Speaker 2>What girl?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

125
00:05:18.621 --> 00:05:22.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't like to generalize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I definitely think that girls mature</v>

126
00:05:22.101 --> 00:05:24.320
<v Speaker 2>quicker than guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100% oh yeah.</v>

127
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.740
<v Speaker 2>I think that's common knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

128
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to figure out why.</v>

129
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.930
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to figure out what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

130
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.190
<v Speaker 2>Parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

131
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's ego.</v>

132
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.770
<v Speaker 2>I think it's ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think men have spent so much time</v>

133
00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.520
<v Speaker 2>coddling the male ego worried about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

134
00:05:40.521 --> 00:05:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go fuck kicked.</v>

135
00:05:41.601 --> 00:05:42.720
<v Speaker 2>This guy's us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

136
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that guy up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like posturing and presenting themselves</v>

137
00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:49.670
<v Speaker 2>like especially when they're really</v>
<v Speaker 2>young as something better than they</v>

138
00:05:49.671 --> 00:05:52.550
<v Speaker 2>actually are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a big part of being a young</v>

139
00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:57.551
<v Speaker 2>man until you realize somewhere around</v>
<v Speaker 2>your thirties I guess that nobody buys</v>

140
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like nobody buys that.</v>

141
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.990
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're posturing and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretending to be someone other than you</v>

142
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think you're giving yourself some</v>

143
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 2>sort of weird comfort or trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like sucking your thumb.</v>

144
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 2>It's not really effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really doing anything.</v>

145
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Women don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the,</v>

146
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:18.170
<v Speaker 2>I'll kick your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the this guy.</v>

147
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 2>What does guy think he's going to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife?</v>

148
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.920
<v Speaker 2>It was his gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's going to take my job was</v>

149
00:06:22.921 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 2>this guy thinks he's going to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>move in next to me and put up a fucking</v>

150
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:26.650
<v Speaker 2>fence in front of mark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

151
00:06:26.651 --> 00:06:30.260
<v Speaker 2>that's my fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when men get this weird thing,</v>

152
00:06:30.261 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get this weird male thing and women</v>

153
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 2>don't get that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get different.</v>

154
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 2>They get pitched things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get,</v>

155
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.260
<v Speaker 2>they get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get their own thing.</v>

156
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.590
<v Speaker 2>You know they get the bitch at each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other but it's not,</v>

157
00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 2>this is not nearly as like physical for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most part,</v>

158
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's much more likely that two man are</v>

159
00:06:48.921 --> 00:06:49.970
<v Speaker 2>going to throw bones.</v>

160
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 2>Then two girls like when two girls</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

161
00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 2>it's like Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went for it.</v>

162
00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:59.810
<v Speaker 2>They like physically trying to claw each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other's eyes out and usually at least</v>

163
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 2>one of them is out of their fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>minds.</v>

164
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.450
<v Speaker 2>If you get two girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously not talking about martial arts</v>

165
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:08.570
<v Speaker 2>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you get two girls involved in a</v>

166
00:07:08.571 --> 00:07:10.370
<v Speaker 2>street fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least one of them is out of their</v>

167
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:15.371
<v Speaker 2>fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said the best like to sane dudes</v>

168
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.120
<v Speaker 2>under the right conditions with alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved could beat the shit out of each</v>

169
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very possible,</v>

170
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 2>very possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with alcohol involved,</v>

171
00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.740
<v Speaker 2>but two girls pulling hair and club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would venture the vast majority of</v>

172
00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:35.171
<v Speaker 2>women out there have never been in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fistfight because vast majority,</v>

173
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 2>80% yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a good number.</v>

174
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 2>I think 80% of kid number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably not right.</v>

175
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.470
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're,</v>

176
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.211
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

177
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:49.211
<v Speaker 2>they have different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things going on and I think</v>

178
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.210
<v Speaker 2>even if they want to be respected and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to be appreciated,</v>

179
00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:55.550
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same as like the male</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

180
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.390
<v Speaker 2>the male wanting to be respected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially our young men.</v>

181
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.780
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to get over just the</v>
<v Speaker 2>natural monkey instincts that boys have.</v>

182
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Just those natural monkey instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so God damn distracting.</v>

183
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.460
<v Speaker 2>That I think is maybe this is just the</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>

184
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:18.500
<v Speaker 2>not even biologically why women be sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>in general faster than men.</v>

185
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.160
<v Speaker 2>It might just be this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lack of the struggle with that male</v>

186
00:08:22.161 --> 00:08:22.994
<v Speaker 2>ego.</v>

187
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian and I talked to him about it.</v>

188
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it?</v>

189
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.520
<v Speaker 3>Do you ever have male instincts to like</v>
<v Speaker 3>buy a girl's neck when you're having sex</v>

190
00:08:33.521 --> 00:08:34.970
<v Speaker 3>with her like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of,</v>

191
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.630
<v Speaker 3>that seems like you'd be somebody that</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be like a neck bite or you'd be</v>

192
00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:38.610
<v Speaker 3>really into it and just go,</v>

193
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.630
<v Speaker 2>do you not want you beaten off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thinking about how I fun so I will stop</v>

194
00:08:42.631 --> 00:08:46.700
<v Speaker 2>this conversation right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

195
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:47.281
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

196
00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:48.840
<v Speaker 2>it's different with different girls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

197
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>With different girls you dated.</v>

198
00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Some girls like to get choked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just do.</v>

199
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.640
<v Speaker 3>I hate all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When a girl tells me to slap him or</v>

200
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:57.880
<v Speaker 3>choke him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the word.</v>

201
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.400
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to beat you up and going</v>

202
00:09:00.401 --> 00:09:03.900
<v Speaker 3>to have to get that from somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have to call her Ari.</v>

203
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 3>Do you think the daddy thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something there.</v>

204
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:08.430
<v Speaker 3>When girls are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck me harder daddy,</v>

205
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:10.590
<v Speaker 3>when is the whole daddy thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think there's something to it?</v>

206
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.050
<v Speaker 3>It's a dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

207
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:13.980
<v Speaker 3>it's dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't mean their dad.</v>

208
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:17.490
<v Speaker 3>They mean you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want you to be their daddy in that</v>

209
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:19.170
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not even like a father,</v>

210
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.470
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the data that's given the Dick,</v>

211
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't even think it's like a</v>

212
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:28.020
<v Speaker 3>different word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different use of the word Daddy,</v>

213
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.090
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean the same thing.</v>

214
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:32.130
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you call someone captain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sub captain,</v>

215
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.080
<v Speaker 3>you don't really think that guy has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>boat.</v>

216
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.840
<v Speaker 3>But what if they follow me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

217
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.530
<v Speaker 3>I told her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing you say,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and she doesn't talk like a kid in any</v>

219

<v Speaker 3>other times except when she's having sex</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to see you leave for school.</v>

227
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean like I'm going to try to go down</v>
<v Speaker 3>that path.</v>

228
00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:09.300
<v Speaker 3>If she brings it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll see if she plays along.</v>

229
00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:10.530
<v Speaker 3>If she plays along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like fun.</v>

230
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:13.860
<v Speaker 3>It's like trying to learn more about</v>
<v Speaker 3>this person that I'm fucking,</v>

233
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.240
<v Speaker 3>Like the dad doesn't even have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse of being drunk</v>

234
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:27.570
<v Speaker 3>coffee and fucks his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is God.</v>

235
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just not your homework.</v>

236
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to find better people,</v>

237
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.870
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you gotta work on yourself.</v>

238
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:34.980
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

239
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.200
<v Speaker 3>Get your own shit in order and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>attract people.</v>

240
00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:40.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't make a noise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't breathe.</v>

241
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 3>I slobber in their hair and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do anything.</v>

242
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Do you still take those pills?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

243
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:49.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stopped at when I started sharing</v>

244
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.950
<v Speaker 3>playing boner pills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

245
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.170
<v Speaker 3>gas station,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boner pills,</v>

246
00:10:52.171 --> 00:10:54.000
<v Speaker 3>gas station,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boner pills specifically.</v>

247
00:10:54.001 --> 00:10:58.530
<v Speaker 3>Brian has like some gas stations picked</v>
<v Speaker 3>out in the valley that he travels to</v>

248
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.550
<v Speaker 3>have Chinese drugs in them that make</v>
<v Speaker 3>your dick a totem pole.</v>

249
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

250
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:04.980
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're very sketchy.</v>

251
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.290
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go to fda.gov and see all the</v>

252
00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:09.180
<v Speaker 3>ingredients and all the ones that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've tested and,</v>

253
00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.330
<v Speaker 3>but I stopped doing it when I start</v>
<v Speaker 3>tripping.</v>

254
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.880
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually saw visuals,</v>

255
00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:17.520
<v Speaker 3>I think I've talked about it on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but recently they've had new packaging</v>

256
00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:19.320
<v Speaker 3>where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holograms and like they're,</v>

257
00:11:19.321 --> 00:11:22.510
<v Speaker 3>they're awesome packaging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a horse running or,</v>

258
00:11:22.511 --> 00:11:23.344
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

259
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.650
<v Speaker 3>like black stallion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A good one.</v>

260
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.470
<v Speaker 3>Here's a question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much do you think it would cost us</v>

261
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.240
<v Speaker 3>to randomly test the gas station pills</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you take and then read the results</v>

262
00:11:33.241 --> 00:11:36.840
<v Speaker 3>on the air?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It probably have some right now that</v>

263
00:11:36.841 --> 00:11:39.150
<v Speaker 3>you've saved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just packaging in my car.</v>

264
00:11:39.151 --> 00:11:42.540
<v Speaker 3>I say about 30 different ones in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you have the packages.</v>

265
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Set aside one package of each one that</v>

266
00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:49.410
<v Speaker 3>you really enjoy blacks down here right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

267
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.530
<v Speaker 3>I want to set these aside and I want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see how much it costs.</v>

268
00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.360
<v Speaker 3>I'll go through the u s uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UFC labs,</v>

269
00:11:55.361 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 3>whatever they use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they use their Nevada state</v>

270
00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:00.190
<v Speaker 3>athletic commission I think uses quest</v>
<v Speaker 3>diagnostics,</v>

271
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:03.760
<v Speaker 3>but they test blood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they test blood and urine.</v>

272
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.850
<v Speaker 3>We can't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we'll find out a place where we</v>

273
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:09.190
<v Speaker 3>could send it to a lab to get the</v>
<v Speaker 3>contents.</v>

274
00:12:09.191 --> 00:12:11.680
<v Speaker 3>Analog Sda has done well on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's done it.</v>

275
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:13.870
<v Speaker 3>So I'll just use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll use whatever guys on it's done.</v>

276
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.280
<v Speaker 3>But FDA has done it for these ones that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're taking,</v>

277
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.210
<v Speaker 3>do you think they're the consistent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're not the same every week.</v>

278
00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 3>They change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could tell they change their</v>

279
00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:24.310
<v Speaker 3>ingredients sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I had one burst open my mouth the</v>

280
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.730
<v Speaker 3>other day and it tastes like tea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've had it before where I burst</v>

281
00:12:27.731 --> 00:12:31.690
<v Speaker 3>open my mouth and it tasted like pills</v>
<v Speaker 3>like inside of a pill,</v>

282
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.180
<v Speaker 3>like a chemical neurol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

283
00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.580
<v Speaker 3>they're all powder inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are powdered.</v>

284
00:12:36.581 --> 00:12:38.890
<v Speaker 3>There's the one that I had the other day</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like a t,</v>

285
00:12:38.891 --> 00:12:41.570
<v Speaker 3>like almost like weed inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But are any of them uh,</v>

286
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:42.420
<v Speaker 3>gels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

287
00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all seem to be like a powder</v>

288
00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:46.780
<v Speaker 3>inside and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like these new ones,</v>

289
00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:50.440
<v Speaker 3>like the latest one black stallion where</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has like a Hologram of a horse</v>

290
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:51.310
<v Speaker 3>running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

291
00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.490
<v Speaker 3>that one legit four days a boner solid.</v>

292
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like really studying it the other</v>

293
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.421
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's,</v>

294
00:12:58.421 --> 00:13:01.720
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like every single pocket of</v>

295
00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Shit on your Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just full.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's swollen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>

297
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.810
<v Speaker 3>it's hard though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels uncomfortable.</v>

298
00:13:07.811 --> 00:13:09.220
<v Speaker 3>Like it doesn't feel like you're normal</v>
<v Speaker 3>dick,</v>

299
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:10.510
<v Speaker 3>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh this is comfortable.</v>

300
00:13:10.511 --> 00:13:13.870
<v Speaker 3>Super high dose of Viagra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's my anger anymore.</v>

301
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.030
<v Speaker 3>I think it used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think this is by,</v>

302
00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.970
<v Speaker 3>I think this is like some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction cause it's like my dick is</v>

303
00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:23.380
<v Speaker 3>swollen up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's got got bit by a snake.</v>

304
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh it's powerful though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

307
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:35.320
<v Speaker 3>but when you're taking this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it go down or do you have to like</v>

308
00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:40.330
<v Speaker 3>deal with a hard dick for hours?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just on call but it's ready to</v>

309
00:13:40.331 --> 00:13:40.850
<v Speaker 3>rock.</v>

310
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:45.850
<v Speaker 3>But when you wake up cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you wake up in the morning it's</v>

311
00:13:46.031 --> 00:13:48.460

<v Speaker 3>And it's only like if like if I'm with a</v>

<v Speaker 3>You would think I was crazy if you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>paid attention to everything I do and</v>

329
00:14:37.361 --> 00:14:42.361
<v Speaker 3>everything I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if we could test him within a</v>

330
00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:46.000
<v Speaker 3>reasonable financial range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should totally for cost a couple of</v>

331
00:14:46.001 --> 00:14:48.070
<v Speaker 3>grand or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>FDA though it really has gone through a</v>

332
00:14:48.071 --> 00:14:49.160
<v Speaker 3>lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of it though,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's been steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of them have had small</v>

334
00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:54.620
<v Speaker 3>amounts of steroids in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was wondering when you were saying</v>

<v Speaker 3>So that's when I kind of stopped my fun</v>
<v Speaker 3>hobby.</v>

<v Speaker 3>people in this gas station laboratory</v>

350
00:15:34.161 --> 00:15:35.550
<v Speaker 3>are not going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

351
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.790
<v Speaker 3>And what's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of them are like,</v>

352
00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I tried to find more information about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the companies that make it good luck.</v>

353
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.780
<v Speaker 3>They don't access shadow governments in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Philippines.</v>

354
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well this is my question.</v>

355
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:51.080
<v Speaker 3>Like they did have an ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like is it say like you look at the</v>

356
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:52.460
<v Speaker 3>package,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says what's in there?</v>

357
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:54.230
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it does.</v>

358
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.390
<v Speaker 3>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can tell it's not what it is.</v>

359
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.270
<v Speaker 3>It's say on the package.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should have rented my car real quick and</v>

360
00:15:59.271 --> 00:16:00.080
<v Speaker 3>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A couple of kids.</v>

361
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.900
<v Speaker 3>I've got to go get one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to talk shit about you while</v>

362
00:16:02.901 --> 00:16:03.734
<v Speaker 3>you're gone.</v>

363
00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.820
<v Speaker 3>He's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know anybody else that takes</v>

364
00:16:08.821 --> 00:16:10.680
<v Speaker 3>those things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only thing I've ever,</v>

365
00:16:10.681 --> 00:16:12.570
<v Speaker 3>I've taken something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not I boner pill,</v>

366
00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:15.260
<v Speaker 3>but I remember taking a bumblebee or</v>
<v Speaker 3>black,</v>

367
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.180
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I can stick a caffeine pill.</v>

368
00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:18.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

369
00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:20.160
<v Speaker 3>I can go on stage or if me and my</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends,</v>

370
00:16:20.161 --> 00:16:22.560
<v Speaker 3>we would take him like Jack ourselves up</v>
<v Speaker 3>before a concert and feel like we're</v>

371
00:16:22.561 --> 00:16:23.910
<v Speaker 3>going to have a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

372
00:16:23.911 --> 00:16:24.470
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

373
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:26.910
<v Speaker 3>it was probably like rip fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that kind of stuff.</v>

374
00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.100
<v Speaker 3>The Federer or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was bad for us too.</v>

375
00:16:29.101 --> 00:16:32.280
<v Speaker 3>We knew those were horrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But see those things,</v>

376
00:16:32.281 --> 00:16:35.320
<v Speaker 3>at least other people were taking them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck do you know?</v>

377
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:39.300
<v Speaker 3>Pioneer gas station,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boner pills and I'm going to do top,</v>

378
00:16:39.301 --> 00:16:43.080
<v Speaker 3>they're like David Crockett.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's setting a standard and he is</v>

379
00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:50.400
<v Speaker 3>just such a ridiculous thing to want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>put in your body when the alternative</v>

380
00:16:50.401 --> 00:16:51.270
<v Speaker 3>exists.</v>

381
00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.000
<v Speaker 3>Like you could go to an actual doctor</v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

382
00:16:54.001 --> 00:16:56.850
<v Speaker 3>I have a hard time getting an erection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll prescribe you viagara.</v>

383
00:16:56.851 --> 00:17:00.120
<v Speaker 3>We all know that doesn't kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe this is the weed of boner pills.</v>

384
00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.490
<v Speaker 3>It's easy to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get it anywhere.</v>

385
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.560
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It definitely is that you don't have to</v>

386
00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:05.470
<v Speaker 3>go to a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

387
00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:06.551
<v Speaker 3>that's what I mean by that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

388
00:17:06.551 --> 00:17:08.550
<v Speaker 3>it used to not have to go to doctors for</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

389
00:17:08.551 --> 00:17:11.790
<v Speaker 3>You used to be able to get things</v>
<v Speaker 3>through Canadian pharmacies.</v>

390
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.160
<v Speaker 3>Canadian pharmacies would just send new</v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>

391
00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:16.380
<v Speaker 3>It was like the big loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do people get,</v>

392
00:17:16.381 --> 00:17:19.200
<v Speaker 3>you can get like that nuvigil stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get free samples online or</v>

393
00:17:19.201 --> 00:17:20.760
<v Speaker 3>something I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you get up.</v>

394
00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:21.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

395
00:17:21.961 --> 00:17:25.140
<v Speaker 3>New vigils.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little different or maybe one version</v>

396
00:17:25.141 --> 00:17:26.910
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Provigil or Nuvigil.</v>

397
00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.290
<v Speaker 3>I know for sure.</v>

398
00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:33.290
<v Speaker 3>I've read guys st posting on message</v>
<v Speaker 3>boards saying that they bought that</v>

399
00:17:33.301 --> 00:17:35.460
<v Speaker 3>stuff somewhere online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was the underground.</v>

400
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:37.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can buy it from this like weird</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're not gonna be able to probably</v>

403
00:17:41.941 --> 00:17:44.260
<v Speaker 3>pick that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's rhino 11 cause it's supposed to be</v>

406
00:17:49.981 --> 00:17:51.750
<v Speaker 3>It comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just for the pill.</v>

407
00:17:51.751 --> 00:17:54.690
<v Speaker 3>It's like this weird matrix capsule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Dude.</v>

408
00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:57.570
<v Speaker 3>How bad are these?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile look at this.</v>

409
00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.780
<v Speaker 3>It says this is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says platinum 6,000 like as if</v>

410
00:18:03.331 --> 00:18:08.331
<v Speaker 3>there's some like measuring going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what's zero platinum?</v>

411
00:18:08.521 --> 00:18:11.640
<v Speaker 3>4,000 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on.</v>

412
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.800
<v Speaker 3>Why are you pretending you have any</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea?</v>

413
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:17.340
<v Speaker 3>Is people making these just thrown some</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit in a bowl and mix it up while</v>

414
00:18:17.341 --> 00:18:18.174
<v Speaker 3>they're drunk?</v>

415
00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.430
<v Speaker 3>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what the fuck's in</v>

416
00:18:20.431 --> 00:18:23.520
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Platinum 6,000 fuck.</v>

417
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.820
<v Speaker 3>These are two companies too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that both use rhinos.</v>

418
00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.550
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't you use Ryan when his</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor Rhino and when is rhino 11?</v>

419
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rhino is what those Asian people,</v>

420
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe that rhino horns give you a rank</v>

421
00:18:38.831 --> 00:18:40.470
<v Speaker 3>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they've killed so many</v>

422
00:18:40.471 --> 00:18:43.260
<v Speaker 3>rhinos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why rhino horns or we're so</v>

423
00:18:43.261 --> 00:18:45.090
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and have you ever seen a Rhino Horn?</v>

424
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.250
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just gross.</v>

425
00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:51.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a giant hard like piece of</v>

426
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:54.990
<v Speaker 3>fingernail or hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like if you look at elephant</v>

427
00:18:54.991 --> 00:18:55.681
<v Speaker 3>tusks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

428
00:18:55.681 --> 00:18:57.450
<v Speaker 3>well I kind of get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's beautiful.</v>

429
00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.650
<v Speaker 3>Those are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are amazing.</v>

430
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.590
<v Speaker 3>Rhino horns don't look cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're gross looking at hill.</v>

431
00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

432
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.910
<v Speaker 3>And so they take those things and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>make some Chinese medicine.</v>

433
00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.320
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't even work.</v>

434
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.520
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that doesn't make your dick hard.</v>

435
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:14.220
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have viagara and they're still</v>

436
00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:17.130
<v Speaker 3>killing rhinos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this actually has ingredients on it.</v>

437
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.040
<v Speaker 3>Like Chinese daughter seed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asparagus.</v>

438
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.440
<v Speaker 3>There's a spare gas in here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Asparagus.</v>

439
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.960
<v Speaker 3>Why would they put asparagus?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want your penis smell different so</v>

440
00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:26.640
<v Speaker 3>that you really feel like something's</v>
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

441
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.150
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they just put asparagus to make it</v>

442
00:19:30.151 --> 00:19:30.481
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

443
00:19:30.481 --> 00:19:33.240
<v Speaker 3>it's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got asparagus 10 and it has none of</v>

444
00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:35.220
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe both arguments were brought up at</v>

445
00:19:35.221 --> 00:19:38.070
<v Speaker 3>the meeting while they were cooking up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>

446
00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:42.450
<v Speaker 3>Best Bathtub Meth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Rhino 12 let's add some Kale.</v>

447
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.100
<v Speaker 3>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

448
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't want any fucking gangsters</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out of us and trying to kill us</v>

449
00:19:47.581 --> 00:19:50.340
<v Speaker 3>because we out what their products are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

450
00:19:50.341 --> 00:19:54.720
<v Speaker 3>because these products are not being</v>
<v Speaker 3>made by above board now folks,</v>

451
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.720
<v Speaker 3>most likely now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they constantly are changing their</v>

452
00:19:57.721 --> 00:19:58.020
<v Speaker 3>names.</v>

453
00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.790
<v Speaker 3>Like if you go through my collection of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

454
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:00.750
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

455
00:20:00.751 --> 00:20:03.390
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why I keep these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're all different names.</v>

456
00:20:03.391 --> 00:20:05.100
<v Speaker 3>There's not one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they have to.</v>

457
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.910
<v Speaker 3>Aubrey was telling us what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what rb says I want.</v>

458
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably butchering it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Aubrey said that these people make</v>

459
00:20:12.511 --> 00:20:14.400
<v Speaker 3>this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They put in Viagara,</v>

460
00:20:14.401 --> 00:20:17.010
<v Speaker 3>which they buy from some Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 3>manufacturer.</v>

461
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.810
<v Speaker 3>They take that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does,</v>

462
00:20:18.811 --> 00:20:21.750
<v Speaker 3>what does it Modafinil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what it's called?</v>

463
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

464
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:28.040
<v Speaker 3>So they buy that stuff in bulk and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sell it for much more than it would</v>

465
00:20:28.051 --> 00:20:30.690
<v Speaker 3>be if they sold it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like if you sell a prescription for</v>

466
00:20:30.691 --> 00:20:32.310
<v Speaker 3>like a hundred pills be x amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars,</v>

467
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:37.080
<v Speaker 3>but if you can stuff it into two gas</v>
<v Speaker 3>station bullshit pills and sell each one</v>

468
00:20:37.081 --> 00:20:39.270
<v Speaker 3>for 10 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how much is a rhino to costs?</v>

469
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:43.470
<v Speaker 3>Well these new ones with the holograms</v>
<v Speaker 3>are like $14 but they last,</v>

470
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.180
<v Speaker 3>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't last 11 days where they</v>

471
00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 3>definitely last a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if that was dessert are only two</v>

472
00:20:48.011 --> 00:20:51.160
<v Speaker 3>pills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that was a bottle of Viagra,</v>

473
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:56.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean $14 it wouldn't be two pills for</v>
<v Speaker 3>$14 it's where they probably make like</v>

474
00:20:56.171 --> 00:21:00.010
<v Speaker 3>100% more and Viagra is bitch compared</v>
<v Speaker 3>to that.</v>

475
00:21:00.011 --> 00:21:00.581
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

476
00:21:00.581 --> 00:21:03.580
<v Speaker 3>like this will beat the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Viagara cause this has like something</v>

477
00:21:03.581 --> 00:21:06.160
<v Speaker 3>that makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Viagra is cool but it lasts a</v>

478
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:06.881
<v Speaker 3>couple hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really do,</v>

479
00:21:06.881 --> 00:21:09.250
<v Speaker 3>it just makes you have a boner kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is like,</v>

480
00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:11.740
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got bit by a snake boner for for</v>

481
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:13.090
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

482
00:21:13.091 --> 00:21:14.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would like to try it,</v>

483
00:21:14.941 --> 00:21:17.850
<v Speaker 3>but it's not worth it and when it gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>you one of the best ones to do it,</v>

484
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:21.820
<v Speaker 3>I found that review of some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dangers that took rhinos seven Oh,</v>

485
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:22.773
<v Speaker 3>this one right here.</v>

486
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.320
<v Speaker 3>This is all that like breakdown of all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the different ingredients and whatnot of</v>

487
00:21:26.321 --> 00:21:27.154
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

488
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:31.110
<v Speaker 3>put that shit up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The main ingredient is called slide sill</v>

489
00:21:31.111 --> 00:21:34.750
<v Speaker 3>that stilled naf believed in Nashville,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the active ingredient in</v>

490
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:35.950
<v Speaker 3>Viagra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

491
00:21:35.951 --> 00:21:36.950
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sold the Nafa,</v>

492
00:21:36.951 --> 00:21:38.730
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would look at it.</v>

493
00:21:38.731 --> 00:21:39.401
<v Speaker 3>It says right to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

494
00:21:39.401 --> 00:21:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Why did I think it was modafinil?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Madame isn't modafinil or Nuvigil.</v>

495
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:44.563
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

496
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.650
<v Speaker 3>If you go up a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a serious side effects like</v>

497
00:21:47.651 --> 00:21:49.300
<v Speaker 3>headache,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nausea and blurred vision.</v>

498
00:21:49.301 --> 00:21:53.590
<v Speaker 3>I had that blurred vision part and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what made me stop these side</v>

499
00:21:53.591 --> 00:21:57.070
<v Speaker 3>effects that generally appear when using</v>
<v Speaker 3>prescription ed medication.</v>

500
00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:01.360
<v Speaker 3>It's funny too because yet the label</v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically makes the claim no</v>

501
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:03.370
<v Speaker 3>headache.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the primary complaints</v>

502
00:22:03.371 --> 00:22:06.420
<v Speaker 3>about the supplement stuff that was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

503
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think her issues really make a lot of</v>

504
00:22:08.381 --> 00:22:08.680
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

505
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.600
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's what it says was in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

506
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.300
<v Speaker 3>Well what about what he found was in it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

507
00:22:13.301 --> 00:22:14.590
<v Speaker 3>well we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just read what it says.</v>

508
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:16.390
<v Speaker 3>Go Gee extract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dang.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

513
00:22:23.441 --> 00:22:25.690
<v Speaker 3>so what's actually in it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really yet.</v>

514
00:22:25.691 --> 00:22:26.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean then he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

515
00:22:26.531 --> 00:22:28.290
<v Speaker 3>he didn't test it himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

516
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.720
<v Speaker 3>it goes up and then did research on all</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things and then did told you how</v>

517
00:22:31.721 --> 00:22:32.890
<v Speaker 3>it worked for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

518
00:22:32.891 --> 00:22:37.660
<v Speaker 3>so did he say it worked?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is Rhino seven work just said it's fast</v>

519
00:22:37.661 --> 00:22:39.450
<v Speaker 3>acting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to write back items</v>

520
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:40.540
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

521
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.780
<v Speaker 3>well there are things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

522
00:22:43.781 --> 00:22:48.010
<v Speaker 3>One thing I can say is I was rock hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says in all caps for like three days</v>

523
00:22:48.011 --> 00:22:50.350
<v Speaker 3>on this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is almost kind of annoying.</v>

524
00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:54.190
<v Speaker 3>It depends on imagine having a hard on</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have to do day to day tasks,</v>

525
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.220
<v Speaker 3>tucking your boner into your pants and</v>
<v Speaker 3>hoping it doesn't just pop out</v>

526
00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.113
<v Speaker 3>unexpectedly.</v>

527
00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

528
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.290
<v Speaker 3>So these things really are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I see,</v>

529
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.320
<v Speaker 3>I thought you were going to send me</v>
<v Speaker 3>something where the guy actually tested</v>

530
00:23:05.321 --> 00:23:08.080
<v Speaker 3>it to find out what the ingredients are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm interested in.</v>

531
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:10.570
<v Speaker 3>If you're gonna have fda.gov if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could probably look up at like a couple</v>

532
00:23:10.571 --> 00:23:13.880
<v Speaker 3>of these different ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust the government and their</v>

533
00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:17.110
<v Speaker 3>line was Bob Chem trails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fucking line was about Dick Pills</v>

534
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.350
<v Speaker 3>definitely makes you a lot hornier like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like horny.</v>

535
00:23:20.351 --> 00:23:24.970
<v Speaker 3>I seek out massages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I seek out like I like,</v>

536
00:23:24.971 --> 00:23:28.620
<v Speaker 3>I literally like am a hundred percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>more hornier than when I'm on these</v>

537
00:23:28.621 --> 00:23:31.900
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like almost bad almost back after you</v>

538
00:23:31.901 --> 00:23:33.700
<v Speaker 3>take them like the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel like shit?</v>

539
00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:35.500
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel worn out now.</v>

540
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.330
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of that kind of affects.</v>

541
00:23:37.331 --> 00:23:39.310
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't get that spokesperson for</v>
<v Speaker 3>boner pills.</v>

542
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.410
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a stake in these companies had an</v>

543
00:23:41.411 --> 00:23:45.100
<v Speaker 3>addiction to them and I spinned out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>control with why don't they fucking</v>

544
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.310
<v Speaker 3>sponsor your podcast?</v>

545
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:47.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't want anything to do with them</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>

546
00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:50.900
<v Speaker 3>Can eat sponsors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This should,</v>

547
00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:53.750
<v Speaker 3>this should be your first sponsor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think on it needs to figure out what's</v>

548
00:23:53.751 --> 00:23:56.990
<v Speaker 3>in these things and make their own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think anovos no,</v>

549
00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.590
<v Speaker 3>probably not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know we don't want to be involved in</v>

550
00:24:00.591 --> 00:24:03.620
<v Speaker 3>any shady shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doctor,</v>

551
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:05.520
<v Speaker 3>doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian's boner pills.</v>

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.580
<v Speaker 3>It's side on it company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could say I'm not really a doctor,</v>

553
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:14.330
<v Speaker 3>but I play one on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking stethoscope on.</v>

<v Speaker 3>This is Dr. Ryan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

555
00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:20.570

<v Speaker 3>Rhino's horn and actual we'll,</v>

556
00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can get that special effects guy,</v>

557
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.360
<v Speaker 3>that guy that did the American Werewolf</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make a rhino horn with blood at the</v>

558
00:24:26.361 --> 00:24:28.920
<v Speaker 3>bottom of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you had just chopped it off like</v>

559
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:29.820
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh like that?</v>

560
00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:31.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And on the other side make it like a</v>

561
00:24:31.311 --> 00:24:33.230
<v Speaker 3>helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it looks like a Dick on the horn.</v>

562
00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:34.760
<v Speaker 3>That'd be so offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People would cry.</v>

563
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.450
<v Speaker 3>They killed a fucking</v>

564
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.580
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just for their show.</v>

565
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Rhinos are beautiful man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is kind of fucked up that they get</v>

566
00:24:44.721 --> 00:24:47.870
<v Speaker 2>killed for that one specific reason for</v>
<v Speaker 2>those horns.</v>

567
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:52.100
<v Speaker 2>So weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just so weird.</v>

568
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.690
<v Speaker 3>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That Rhino,</v>

569
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.790
<v Speaker 3>even though it looks sad that he got his</v>
<v Speaker 3>horns chopped off,</v>

570
00:24:55.791 --> 00:24:58.400
<v Speaker 3>he's probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did my face is a lot lighter now.</v>

571
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.990
<v Speaker 3>This is way better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>

572
00:24:59.991 --> 00:25:00.640
<v Speaker 3>He's an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was stupid stupid eyelashes.</v>

574
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:03.703
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know shit.</v>

575
00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:05.950
<v Speaker 2>But did they chop his horn off to save</v>
<v Speaker 2>him?</v>

576
00:25:05.951 --> 00:25:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Is that what they did here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I know they're doing some weird</v>

577
00:25:08.411 --> 00:25:11.620
<v Speaker 2>stuff to save.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>

578
00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.870
<v Speaker 2>So it just made foot boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

579
00:25:13.871 --> 00:25:16.060
<v Speaker 2>farmed game.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

582
00:25:20.231 --> 00:25:25.231
<v Speaker 2>and then cut the fucking horns off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stole seven rhino horns from a safe.</v>

583
00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the photo doesn't represent,</v>

584
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.420
<v Speaker 2>does that photoshop maybe looks real</v>
<v Speaker 2>either way.</v>

585
00:25:32.310 --> 00:25:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing this to elephants.</v>

586
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.430
<v Speaker 2>They're painting their tusks pink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're dying.</v>

587
00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:40.930
<v Speaker 2>The breast cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

588
00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:44.080
<v Speaker 2>For Awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For Awareness.</v>

589
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Talk for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I write something down.</v>

590
00:25:49.571 --> 00:25:51.340
<v Speaker 2>I've been forgetting and I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>remembered.</v>

591
00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on one second.</v>

592
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:57.330
<v Speaker 3>The rhinos on these boner pills all have</v>
<v Speaker 3>their horns though.</v>

593
00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:00.690
<v Speaker 3>So that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's weird that,</v>

594
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:04.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>aunts and rhinoceroses both supposedly</v>

595
00:26:04.441 --> 00:26:06.750
<v Speaker 3>can make boners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

596
00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like ants.</v>

597
00:26:08.341 --> 00:26:11.700
<v Speaker 3>Like if you grind up these African ants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can also make boners.</v>

598
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.550
<v Speaker 3>But Rhinoceros Horn doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it does.</v>

599
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it does act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many rhinos,</v>

600
00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:18.450
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hello.</v>

601
00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:19.270
<v Speaker 3>Over these</v>

602
00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:22.300
<v Speaker 2>side of that Chinese medicine stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 2>just doesn't do anything.</v>

603
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Some of it's got to work though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

604
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.140
<v Speaker 2>they were hitting mess back then when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't do testing that you had a</v>

605
00:26:28.141 --> 00:26:29.890
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had a hope that you find a guy that</v>

606
00:26:29.891 --> 00:26:33.220
<v Speaker 2>was completely legit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A guy who really knew how to make magic</v>

607
00:26:33.221 --> 00:26:35.830
<v Speaker 2>potions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So essentially what it was when they</v>

608
00:26:35.831 --> 00:26:37.570
<v Speaker 2>didn't have any data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no internet,</v>

609
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.360
<v Speaker 2>no encyclopedias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no fucking medical books to call upon</v>

610
00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.490
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those fucking people there.</v>

611
00:26:42.491 --> 00:26:43.740
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of guessing going on.</v>

612
00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:48.320
<v Speaker 4>Not Real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not real sack of online thing that</v>

613
00:26:48.321 --> 00:26:49.840
<v Speaker 4>kind of went viral.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

614
00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:53.180
<v Speaker 4>But there's still some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>conservation effort going on,</v>

615
00:26:53.181 --> 00:26:55.790
<v Speaker 4>but the pink tusk painting isn't a real</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

616
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:59.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so was it a photoshop thing or was it a</v>

617
00:26:59.141 --> 00:26:59.974
<v Speaker 2>hoax?</v>

618
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:03.300
<v Speaker 4>Both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reports online regarding elephant</v>

619
00:27:03.301 --> 00:27:06.210
<v Speaker 4>Tusk being painted pink and an effort to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do value the ivory poachers.</v>

620
00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:06.831
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this man,</v>

621
00:27:06.831 --> 00:27:08.750
<v Speaker 2>people would still take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd go,</v>

622
00:27:08.751 --> 00:27:10.190
<v Speaker 2>dude is a pink one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one.</v>

623
00:27:10.191 --> 00:27:13.800
<v Speaker 2>They tried to save site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

624
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:15.620
<v Speaker 2>it is kind of fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

625
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.560
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just such a weird,</v>

626
00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:24.620
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing that people would do</v>
<v Speaker 2>to chop off a part of an animal's face</v>

627
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.940
<v Speaker 2>to try to get their dick hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

628
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be one thing if there wasn't an</v>

629
00:27:30.291 --> 00:27:32.150
<v Speaker 2>alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think?</v>

630
00:27:32.151 --> 00:27:34.130
<v Speaker 2>If it was really awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have heard about it though.</v>

631
00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.051
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

632
00:27:36.051 --> 00:27:38.120
<v Speaker 2>I think I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it might be.</v>

633
00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.750
<v Speaker 2>There might be something to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

634
00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:45.170
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you Google?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can Rhino Horns really give you an</v>

635
00:27:45.171 --> 00:27:47.330
<v Speaker 2>erection?</v>

<v Speaker 2>There's still men out there that</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly believe that powdered Horn of</v>

662
00:28:46.241 --> 00:28:48.580
<v Speaker 2>an animal that has been butchered,</v>

665
00:28:52.001 --> 00:28:53.770
<v Speaker 2>chainsaw can still be effective.</v>

666
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:58.450
<v Speaker 2>Cure for rectal dysfunction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we really still this backward?</v>

667
00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't the medical companies that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>the marketing meds that are marketing</v>

668
00:29:03.161 --> 00:29:05.530
<v Speaker 2>meds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are supposed to be temporary</v>

669
00:29:05.531 --> 00:29:07.780
<v Speaker 2>curious for this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be targeting the men?</v>

670
00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Mainly Oriental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asian racist.</v>

671
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.840
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure who are directly responsible</v>

672
00:29:13.841 --> 00:29:16.480
<v Speaker 2>for the death of so many rhino or I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

673
00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:20.050
<v Speaker 2>isn't it the way to say it or rhinos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it sounds better.</v>

674
00:29:20.051 --> 00:29:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Like you're a sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like dear so many Rhino Octopi.</v>

675
00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan of OCTOPI.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

676
00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.760
<v Speaker 2>I thought that most Far Eastern</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries were actually quite</v>

677
00:29:30.761 --> 00:29:33.310
<v Speaker 2>progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they themselves are proving that</v>

678
00:29:33.311 --> 00:29:35.770
<v Speaker 2>they are not exclamation point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

679
00:29:35.771 --> 00:29:40.420
<v Speaker 2>fuck phase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a billion people in China alone,</v>

680
00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:44.680
<v Speaker 2>one yen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not that many people chopping</v>

681
00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:47.740
<v Speaker 2>off rhino horns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you compare them to the idiots that</v>

682
00:29:47.741 --> 00:29:50.920
<v Speaker 2>we have here in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just by capita.</v>

683
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:54.430
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a number of people that are scarfing of</v>

684
00:29:54.431 --> 00:29:57.820
<v Speaker 2>Rhino Horn in Asia versus the number of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people here,</v>

685
00:29:57.821 --> 00:30:02.140
<v Speaker 2>they're chewing on bath salts is</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably way more bass.</v>

686
00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.390
<v Speaker 2>All people here than Rhino Horn people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

687
00:30:04.391 --> 00:30:07.000
<v Speaker 2>that's a totally racist thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir.</v>

688
00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.180
<v Speaker 2>For someone who is so concerned with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>health and welfare of these Rhina Sy,</v>

689
00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.860
<v Speaker 2>this guy's an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

690
00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.330
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy on a forum.</v>

691
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.470
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to be an idiot on a forum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easily been in India on a podcast</v>

692
00:30:20.471 --> 00:30:22.480
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to be an idiot,</v>

693
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:25.330
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I just,</v>

694
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:28.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's,</v>

695
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.420
<v Speaker 2>there seems to be like an easy cure for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

696
00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Like if you just got them some of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gas station,</v>

697
00:30:33.611 --> 00:30:35.530
<v Speaker 2>boner pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't want to have anything to</v>

698
00:30:35.531 --> 00:30:38.200
<v Speaker 2>do with a rhino horn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Rhino Horn is worth thousands of</v>

699
00:30:38.201 --> 00:30:38.500
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

700
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.470
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unless there is a little bit of Rhino</v>

701
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:45.530
<v Speaker 5>Horn in all these imagined calling us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They even made a Hologram on this one.</v>

702
00:30:45.531 --> 00:30:45.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

703
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.860
<v Speaker 2>no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if that's what it is.</v>

704
00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We kind of find out,</v>

705
00:30:49.301 --> 00:30:51.160
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet we would be the pioneer.</v>

706
00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:55.180
<v Speaker 2>I'd be be the first person to actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a scientific test on these pills,</v>

707
00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:58.750
<v Speaker 2>including the people that made them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet they never tested shit.</v>

708
00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:00.460
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what the fuck's in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

709
00:31:00.461 --> 00:31:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

710
00:31:02.051 --> 00:31:04.750
<v Speaker 2>when we had some of the earlier versions</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Alpha brain,</v>

711
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:09.850
<v Speaker 2>we would run these random tests on them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'd find out that like there would</v>

712
00:31:09.851 --> 00:31:14.320
<v Speaker 2>be like b12 in air or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that or creating or it wasn't creating,</v>

713
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.950
<v Speaker 2>it was a beat 12 I would have to ask</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aubrey,</v>

714
00:31:17.951 --> 00:31:22.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about my ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom line was the mixers that</v>

715
00:31:22.421 --> 00:31:24.430
<v Speaker 2>they used for our stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

716
00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.490
<v Speaker 2>when they combine all of our stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't clean it out,</v>

717
00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.070
<v Speaker 2>so they had whatever was in there</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

718
00:31:30.071 --> 00:31:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Even though those just trace a trace</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount,</v>

719
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:34.550
<v Speaker 2>they don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just don't</v>

720
00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:39.820
<v Speaker 2>shake that bag.</v>

<v Speaker 5>freeway,</v>

731
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.340
<v Speaker 5>like under an underpass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're cooking it right in plain sight.</v>

<v Speaker 5>la looking left and looking right.</v>

737
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:23.550
<v Speaker 5>Apparently there's a big NPR piece on</v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

738

<v Speaker 5>The other NBR people are in the getting</v>

740
00:32:29.401 --> 00:32:31.740
<v Speaker 5>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it says contrary to the popular myth</v>

741
00:32:31.741 --> 00:32:35.070
<v Speaker 5>and the West Rhino Horn was never</v>
<v Speaker 5>traditionally viewed as an aphrodisiac.</v>

742
00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:37.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm finding some stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 5>hangover</v>

744
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:45.430
<v Speaker 4>cure is valued more than gold.</v>

<v Speaker 4>something like $1,400 an ounce.</v>

746
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Paris and gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're talking about?</v>

747
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than gold.</v>

<v Speaker 2>H.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

779
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Retired Tom Dawn as we think we retired</v>
<v Speaker 2>official who used to approve</v>

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.450
<v Speaker 2>construction projects in the Vietnamese</v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

781
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:16.630
<v Speaker 2>Got his stash of Rhino Horn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He began taking Rhino Horn to recover</v>

782
00:34:16.701 --> 00:34:21.701
<v Speaker 2>from drinking binges with contractors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I drank alcohol,</v>

783
00:34:21.801 --> 00:34:23.810
<v Speaker 2>I'd go home and grind the horn and</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink.</v>

784
00:34:23.811 --> 00:34:24.650
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

785
00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:28.130
<v Speaker 2>a 65 year old grandfather of two an hour</v>
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>

786
00:34:28.131 --> 00:34:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I'd throw up and feel sober again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm hmm.</v>

787
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:35.630
<v Speaker 2>That chick lake city has breakfast</v>
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>

788
00:34:35.631 --> 00:34:40.631
<v Speaker 2>He unwraps piece of newspaper to reveal</v>
<v Speaker 2>small grade block of Rhino Horn.</v>

789
00:34:40.971 --> 00:34:44.360
<v Speaker 2>He received as a gift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa boy.</v>

790
00:34:44.361 --> 00:34:49.361
<v Speaker 2>Paul pours water into a specially made</v>
<v Speaker 2>bowl with a rough bottom and grinds the</v>

791
00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:54.821
<v Speaker 2>block of Horn into a milky white liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The grinding creates an odor that smells</v>

792
00:34:56.841 --> 00:34:59.900
<v Speaker 2>like burned hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because Rhino Horn contains</v>

793
00:34:59.901 --> 00:35:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Keratin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main component,</v>

794
00:35:01.611 --> 00:35:06.320
<v Speaker 2>fingernails and hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says that the value of Rhino Horn</v>

795
00:35:06.321 --> 00:35:11.321
<v Speaker 2>grew as the value of Rhino Horn grew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It became a kind of currency.</v>

796
00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked.</v>

797
00:35:12.621 --> 00:35:15.500
<v Speaker 2>It's a part of their culture that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked.</v>

798
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.020
<v Speaker 2>That's fucked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like trading in,</v>

799
00:35:18.021 --> 00:35:21.590
<v Speaker 2>giving it to officials and bosses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'll could I have her yo.</v>

801
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.370
<v Speaker 4>Why don't we just like liquor that way?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes people use it.</v>

802
00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.420
<v Speaker 2>How about Cuban cigars too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

803
00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:28.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

804
00:35:28.931 --> 00:35:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Cuban cigars were the thing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuban cigars up until really recently,</v>

805
00:35:33.811 --> 00:35:37.290
<v Speaker 2>were illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could smoke one right now and it was</v>

806
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:38.790
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Powerful Chris Mcguire.</v>

819
00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:16.800
<v Speaker 2>We're here smoking a Cuban cigars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to smoke them now.</v>

820
00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.330

<v Speaker 2>you got to get to Cuba now.</v>

822
00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.690

<v Speaker 2>going to turn into fucking applebee's.</v>

823
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:25.890
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

825
00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:33.340
<v Speaker 2>bite the end off here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read something about how like we</v>

826
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:35.490
<v Speaker 2>are already these dried out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna.</v>

827
00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.670
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard that were like taking all their</v>

828
00:36:38.671 --> 00:36:41.160
<v Speaker 2>beverages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Americans are already like</v>

829
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.080
<v Speaker 2>taking it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like other waters broke apart.</v>

830
00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.660
<v Speaker 2>It broke apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's dry.</v>

831
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.870
<v Speaker 2>We didn't put them in the human door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought they were in these,</v>

832
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.530
<v Speaker 2>there's different kinds of these tubes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of these tubes are sealed.</v>

833
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.600
<v Speaker 2>These ones are just kind of screwed</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

834
00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Let's say the Gar.</v>

835
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:04.263
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

836
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:08.600
<v Speaker 2>People hear that silence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a sound to me being a man smoking</v>

837
00:37:08.601 --> 00:37:10.010
<v Speaker 2>a cigar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuban by the way,</v>

838
00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.720
<v Speaker 2>probably fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just chewing on it.</v>

839
00:37:11.721 --> 00:37:13.120
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't chew on Dude,</v>

840
00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:18.450
<v Speaker 2>we can get you sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I chewed tobacco when I was a kid cause</v>

841
00:37:23.061 --> 00:37:26.870
<v Speaker 2>I read Tom Sawyer and huckleberry Finn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is now centered.</v>

842
00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.053
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

843
00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:30.720
<v Speaker 2>Shoot you like on the side of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>

844
00:37:30.721 --> 00:37:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real chew like you buy a brick of</v>

845
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:36.650
<v Speaker 2>it</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be and men here,</v>

846
00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:40.830
<v Speaker 2>men one turn that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>air conditioning thing on behind you</v>

847
00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:44.370
<v Speaker 2>and we'll uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get some,</v>

848
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:49.760
<v Speaker 2>some hot flow up in this bitch</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

849
00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were talking,</v>

850
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:56.160
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a a like a brick that looked</v>

851
00:37:56.161 --> 00:37:58.920
<v Speaker 2>like maybe like a pack of gum or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that and you pull it</v>

852
00:37:58.921 --> 00:38:03.750
<v Speaker 2>apart and then you bite into the brick</v>
<v Speaker 2>and pull off chunks of tobacco and chew</v>

853
00:38:03.751 --> 00:38:05.220
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I almost threw up once.</v>

854
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:07.230
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I did throw up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>

855
00:38:07.231 --> 00:38:08.160
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is stupid.</v>

856
00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.710
<v Speaker 2>But I got into it because of Tom Sawyer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and huckleberry Finn.</v>

857
00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:14.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never got into smoking cigars because</v>

858
00:38:14.371 --> 00:38:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I wanted in a hail it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

859
00:38:16.741 --> 00:38:18.600
<v Speaker 2>but you get high as fuck off these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

860
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Tobacco has some sort of psychoactive</v>
<v Speaker 2>properties to it for sure.</v>

861
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:29.240
<v Speaker 2>And I think that they use it in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>IOWASCA rituals with a,</v>

862
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:33.600
<v Speaker 2>they light tobacco smoke and they blow</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in your face while you're tripping.</v>

863
00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.910
<v Speaker 2>And both Aubrey and Amber Lyon when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>did it,</v>

864
00:38:36.911 --> 00:38:39.790
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely got some,</v>

865
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.540
<v Speaker 2>like I've smoked cigars before and got</v>
<v Speaker 2>some really good ideas where I was like,</v>

866
00:38:43.541 --> 00:38:44.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brain is flying.</v>

867
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:50.350
<v Speaker 2>You'd probably really like cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't wait until,</v>

868
00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:53.490
<v Speaker 2>except for the whole being healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

869
00:38:53.491 --> 00:38:54.820
<v Speaker 2>it probably would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

870
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.811
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo,</v>

871
00:38:55.811 --> 00:38:57.160
<v Speaker 2>we'll smoke a cigarette every now and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

872
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:58.483
<v Speaker 2>I remember that thing.</v>

873
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.510
<v Speaker 4>I found that thing a couple of weeks ago</v>
<v Speaker 4>that didn't want to bring up because I</v>

874
00:39:01.511 --> 00:39:04.030
<v Speaker 4>wasn't sure if it was real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it said that cigarettes are like</v>

875
00:39:04.031 --> 00:39:06.340
<v Speaker 4>proven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was some study that was proven to</v>

876
00:39:06.341 --> 00:39:09.070
<v Speaker 4>give some sort of benefit for</v>
<v Speaker 4>creativity.</v>

877
00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:12.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was the negative of the inhaling</v>

878
00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.910
<v Speaker 4>almost didn't even outweigh the benefit</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got from creativity.</v>

879
00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.190
<v Speaker 2>Well health wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

880
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.100
<v Speaker 2>the risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

881
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.460
<v Speaker 2>They were saying that it's like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nootropic that it actually stimulates</v>

882
00:39:21.461 --> 00:39:24.100
<v Speaker 2>brain function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if that's the case then you just</v>

883
00:39:24.101 --> 00:39:26.290
<v Speaker 2>talking about the nicotine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

884
00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:28.630
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done before shows,</v>

885
00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:31.510
<v Speaker 2>I've sucked on those blue cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But first of all,</v>

886
00:39:31.511 --> 00:39:35.050
<v Speaker 2>because I want to be Stephen Dorff</v>
<v Speaker 2>secretly and second of all,</v>

887
00:39:35.051 --> 00:39:37.030
<v Speaker 2>because they do give you like a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>pep,</v>

888
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:39.970
<v Speaker 2>like a cup of coffee type pep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

889
00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:40.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that is,</v>

890
00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:42.370
<v Speaker 2>but that's not as strong as its</v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarette</v>

891
00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.600
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That shit's bullshit compared to a</v>

892
00:39:44.601 --> 00:39:46.970
<v Speaker 5>cigarette like I've tried.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why I've tried doing like the</v>

893
00:39:46.971 --> 00:39:49.210
<v Speaker 5>vape life and all that bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's just a,</v>

894
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.200
<v Speaker 5>it's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's just something to,</v>

895
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.860
<v Speaker 2>I should smoke a cigarette before I go</v>
<v Speaker 2>onstage.</v>

896
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see if it was just one time.</v>

897
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:56.993
<v Speaker 2>See what it's like.</v>

898
00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:00.180
<v Speaker 5>You should also have it with your</v>
<v Speaker 5>morning coffee after you eat after sex.</v>

899
00:40:00.181 --> 00:40:03.570
<v Speaker 5>You should have it with a drink while</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're driving.</v>

900
00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:07.190
<v Speaker 2>The problem is</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get addicted,</v>

901
00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:08.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want,</v>

902
00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not going to get addicted to</v>

903
00:40:11.211 --> 00:40:11.771
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

904
00:40:11.771 --> 00:40:12.604
<v Speaker 2>I'll never let,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

905
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:15.140
<v Speaker 2>the habit of doing it every time you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a show and yeah,</v>

906
00:40:15.141 --> 00:40:17.930
<v Speaker 2>that could be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you only smoked two cigarettes a</v>

907
00:40:17.931 --> 00:40:20.500
<v Speaker 2>weekend over the course of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's got,</v>

908
00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:21.610
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

909
00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.450
<v Speaker 2>But you're old enough to do it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

910
00:40:23.451 --> 00:40:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Eddie does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only reason why I would think</v>

911
00:40:25.701 --> 00:40:28.190
<v Speaker 2>there'd be a way to do it is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie,</v>

912
00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Eddie just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll smoke a cigarette every now and</v>

913
00:40:30.531 --> 00:40:33.530
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he might smoke once a month or</v>

914
00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:36.050
<v Speaker 2>every two months or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

915
00:40:36.051 --> 00:40:37.880
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what does [inaudible] look at every</v>

916
00:40:37.881 --> 00:40:39.320
<v Speaker 2>now and then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every now and then we'll have one.</v>

917
00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>

918
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Diaz used to do that for a while too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't do it anymore.</v>

919
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.160
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he still does the blu cigarette</v>

920
00:40:46.161 --> 00:40:48.530
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about Joey not native to</v>

921
00:40:48.531 --> 00:40:51.700
<v Speaker 2>make our nick by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

922
00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.790
<v Speaker 2>dses to even after he quit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would go outside and take a cigarette</v>

923
00:40:55.791 --> 00:40:57.710
<v Speaker 2>from you smoke one like right before a</v>
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>

924
00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:00.920
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely some benefit in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nicotine.</v>

925
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:02.900
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just would,</v>

926
00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.440
<v Speaker 2>I would wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should just smoke a cigar before</v>

927
00:41:06.441 --> 00:41:08.870
<v Speaker 2>I go on stage.</v>

928
00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:13.110
<v Speaker 5>I'd say cigarettes probably better</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you're inhaling it or you're</v>

929
00:41:13.111 --> 00:41:15.420
<v Speaker 5>supposed to inhale it and it's faster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're not sticking up.</v>

930
00:41:15.421 --> 00:41:17.550
<v Speaker 5>The place here that's a problem with is</v>
<v Speaker 5>tanking up the place.</v>

<v Speaker 5>they get immediately angry.</v>

935
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:24.540
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

943
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:41.840

<v Speaker 2>The only reason why I didn't want to</v>

944
00:41:41.841 --> 00:41:43.610
<v Speaker 2>watch that show is because I read headed</v>

<v Speaker 2>some pounds on tobacco.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'd never really do spliffs.</v>

952
00:41:59.631 --> 00:42:02.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a spliff guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I was hanging out with Charlie</v>

955
00:42:07.071 --> 00:42:12.071
<v Speaker 2>nicotine together.</v>

<v Speaker 2>time before in my life.</v>

957
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:17.150
<v Speaker 2>Doing shows with Charlie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Murphy is one of the coolest</v>

<v Speaker 2>Did they say y'all a lot and get mad and</v>

970
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.850

<v Speaker 2>signs.</v>

971
00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Like I could never be a cigar smoker in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my house because then you could tell</v>

<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

974
00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.950
<v Speaker 2>Don't know what you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't love it as much as pipes.</v>

975
00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.950
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I was thinking of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it a Bertrand Russell,</v>

976
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:10.940
<v Speaker 2>I think who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a a a famous inveterate pipe smoker.</v>

977
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:13.100
<v Speaker 2>Tobacco addict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant man.</v>

978
00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:15.500
<v Speaker 2>And back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

979
00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:19.040
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't fly unless he could smoke on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plane.</v>

980
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:20.780
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't fly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said.</v>

981
00:43:20.781 --> 00:43:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>

982

983
00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.000
<v Speaker 2>He's got a story about a on tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you find,</v>

984
00:43:26.001 --> 00:43:27.500
<v Speaker 2>find the youtube clip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

985
00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Bertrand Russell on tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating guy,</v>

986
00:43:31.611 --> 00:43:35.990

<v Speaker 2>of information as far as the modern</v>

987
00:43:35.991 --> 00:43:40.130
<v Speaker 2>world and the world of photography and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to document things.</v>

988
00:43:40.131 --> 00:43:45.131

<v Speaker 7>people in the back pain would drown</v>

1001
00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:38.460
<v Speaker 7>people in into smoking pot and jumped</v>
<v Speaker 7>into the Norwegian showed where we</v>

1002
00:44:38.461 --> 00:44:41.790
<v Speaker 7>landed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Edward saved to the,</v>

1003
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.110
<v Speaker 7>I owe my life to smoking.</v>

1004
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:44.850
<v Speaker 3>Did you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did he drown?</v>

1005
00:44:44.851 --> 00:44:49.050
<v Speaker 3>All the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing crash,</v>

1006
00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:54.380
<v Speaker 3>crazy sacrifice that story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a plane crash bro.</v>

1007
00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:58.030
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all the people that you see,</v>

1008
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:01.800
<v Speaker 3>there's a real ashtray that somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>this seems like one of those stories</v>

1009
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.350
<v Speaker 3>that everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh is that true?</v>

1010
00:45:04.351 --> 00:45:07.410
<v Speaker 3>But there was no internet back then so</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all just believed this guy.</v>

1011
00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:09.300
<v Speaker 3>I think there probably wouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>been a plane accident,</v>

1012
00:45:09.301 --> 00:45:11.400
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he probably made this shit up and</v>

1013
00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.740
<v Speaker 3>just cause he's old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a British accent or whatever,</v>

1014
00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:17.280
<v Speaker 2>like of liars got together and you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>the had like liar conventions.</v>

1015
00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Like the years that the internet came</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1016
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:20.310
<v Speaker 2>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boys,</v>

1017
00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.680
<v Speaker 2>we've got some problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got some problems on the horizon.</v>

1018
00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:24.360
<v Speaker 2>We've got to figure out where to live</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

1019
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:26.880
<v Speaker 2>This is how you got to cover your</v>
<v Speaker 2>tracks.</v>

1020
00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:30.660
<v Speaker 2>Like liars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to be super common to be</v>

1021
00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:33.750
<v Speaker 2>completely full of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly about your martial arts</v>

1022
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:36.850
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of really crazy people</v>

1023
00:45:36.851 --> 00:45:41.130
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid that will like claim in</v>
<v Speaker 2>martial arts master and they would walk</v>

1024
00:45:41.131 --> 00:45:44.730
<v Speaker 2>around with like Chinese Kung Fu outfits</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and shit and slippers.</v>

1025
00:45:44.731 --> 00:45:48.060
<v Speaker 2>They're walk around with those Ninja</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoes where they had the toe that was</v>

1026
00:45:48.061 --> 00:45:49.830
<v Speaker 2>split.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen those shoes?</v>

1027
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:54.600
<v Speaker 2>I've seen dudes walk around with Kung Fu</v>
<v Speaker 2>outfits and did represent two completely</v>

1028
00:45:54.601 --> 00:45:57.720
<v Speaker 2>different countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Kung Fu outfit is from Japan.</v>

1029
00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:00.150
<v Speaker 2>The Ninjas slippers or from Japan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

1030
00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:03.210
<v Speaker 2>the Kung Fu output is from China rather</v>
<v Speaker 2>than Ninja outfit is from Japan.</v>

1031
00:46:03.211 --> 00:46:07.800
<v Speaker 2>These motherfuckers would mix and match</v>
<v Speaker 2>the different styles of train killer.</v>

1032
00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:13.090
<v Speaker 3>That guy isn't a good example though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how back then you'd be like,</v>

1033
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:16.900
<v Speaker 3>so every single person died in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsmoking like every single one,</v>

1034
00:46:16.901 --> 00:46:19.180
<v Speaker 3>every like there was a line where it</v>
<v Speaker 3>said no smoking.</v>

1035
00:46:19.181 --> 00:46:20.590
<v Speaker 3>All those people died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1036
00:46:20.591 --> 00:46:22.320
<v Speaker 3>the front of the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll all see you</v>

1037
00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:26.590
<v Speaker 2>think of when you're watching a guy like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bertrand Russell.</v>

1038
00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:28.180
<v Speaker 2>How what?</v>

<v Speaker 2>talking about how it saved his life,</v>

1040

<v Speaker 2>shitty ass old grainy movie,</v>

1041
00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:41.440
<v Speaker 2>which was in black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was probably a long fucking time</v>

1042
00:46:41.441 --> 00:46:45.880
<v Speaker 2>ago when planes were made out of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>gum wrappers is when he died.</v>

1043
00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:47.410
<v Speaker 2>That's when that interview was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1044
00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:52.390
<v Speaker 2>so if it's in 59 then the plane was</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably from the forties or fifties I</v>

1045
00:46:52.391 --> 00:46:53.650
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows when that happened,</v>

1046
00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:55.350
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ain't</v>

1047
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:57.400
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just mad denial and wanting an</v>

1048
00:46:57.401 --> 00:46:58.820
<v Speaker 3>excuse for smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1050
00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:04.970

1051
00:47:04.971 --> 00:47:06.830
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my grandfather used to smoke and he</v>

1052
00:47:06.831 --> 00:47:08.840
<v Speaker 3>used to have those big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back in the day they used to have,</v>

1053

<v Speaker 3>there's big lighters that would sit on</v>
<v Speaker 3>your desk and it was just like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember those.</v>

1056
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.440

<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1057
00:47:19.441 --> 00:47:21.210
<v Speaker 2>it was real.</v>

<v Speaker 2>A flying boat house.</v>

1060
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:31.360
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't you mentioned that Birch</v>
<v Speaker 2>flying bus survivors.</v>

1061
00:47:31.361 --> 00:47:34.170
<v Speaker 2>We're all in the smoking compartment at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back of the cabin.</v>

1062
00:47:34.171 --> 00:47:35.200
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

1063
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Among the survivors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will the philosopher,</v>

1064

<v Speaker 2>Although it does say I'm five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine and brian cows,</v>

1067
00:47:44.081 --> 00:47:46.750
<v Speaker 2>my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

1068
00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he added that Brian?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1069
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.070
<v Speaker 2>I think as in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1070
00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:52.690
<v Speaker 2>one of the things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1071
00:47:52.691 --> 00:47:53.690
<v Speaker 2>a shiny yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

1072
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:54.790
<v Speaker 2>not shiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Happy Jihad.</v>

1073
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:58.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be dead someday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sketch that Brian Count and I did in</v>

1074
00:47:58.271 --> 00:48:00.850
<v Speaker 2>my parents' basement where we're banging</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>

1075
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:02.260
<v Speaker 2>we're working out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're getting pumped.</v>

1076
00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I think what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how that whole thing started is because</v>

1077
00:48:05.441 --> 00:48:09.430
<v Speaker 2>you used to say he's your brother from</v>
<v Speaker 2>another mother and some idiot was like,</v>

1078
00:48:09.431 --> 00:48:10.360
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're brothers.</v>

1079
00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe it's just for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people did any,</v>

1080
00:48:13.481 --> 00:48:15.850
<v Speaker 2>looks like my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he totally looks like he'd be my</v>

1081
00:48:15.851 --> 00:48:17.440
<v Speaker 2>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we just grew in different</v>

1082
00:48:17.441 --> 00:48:19.770
<v Speaker 2>directions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went north and south and I went east</v>

1083
00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:24.680
<v Speaker 2>and West</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be stretched his face out and he</v>

1084
00:48:24.681 --> 00:48:25.920
<v Speaker 2>stretched his shoulders out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1085
00:48:25.921 --> 00:48:29.200
<v Speaker 2>it's very similar in a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's um,</v>

1086
00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:31.990
<v Speaker 2>might as well be my brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1087
00:48:31.991 --> 00:48:33.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wikipedia is wrong about a lot of shit.</v>

1088
00:48:33.831 --> 00:48:35.860
<v Speaker 2>It says I have crones disease to at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least it used to,</v>

1089
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:38.980
<v Speaker 2>which I don't word that even start for</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1090
00:48:38.981 --> 00:48:40.180
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be in funny,</v>

1091
00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:42.730
<v Speaker 2>so I'm being silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to change any of it.</v>

1092
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:47.200
<v Speaker 2>I think it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like what the Internet does for the</v>

1093
00:48:47.201 --> 00:48:49.870
<v Speaker 2>most part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a little bit of disinformation</v>

1094
00:48:49.871 --> 00:48:50.980
<v Speaker 2>makes a little p.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People go,</v>

1095
00:48:50.981 --> 00:48:51.310
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1096
00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:52.360
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you serious?</v>

1097
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:55.630
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even when those stupid stories come</v>

1098
00:48:55.631 --> 00:48:56.860
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I killed them out in line with a</v>

1099
00:48:56.861 --> 00:48:59.230
<v Speaker 2>belt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My own sister called me up,</v>

1100
00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:01.270
<v Speaker 2>my own fucking sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1101
00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:02.061
<v Speaker 2>was that true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

1102
00:49:02.061 --> 00:49:04.330
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't kill a mountain line with a</v>

1103
00:49:04.331 --> 00:49:05.950
<v Speaker 2>bell like you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think I'd call you?</v>

1104
00:49:05.951 --> 00:49:07.390
<v Speaker 2>If I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

1105
00:49:07.391 --> 00:49:10.420
<v Speaker 2>strap yourself in sister.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause your brother's a fucking</v>

1106
00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.590
<v Speaker 2>killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Outline with a pal.</v>

1107
00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a fucking mount mine with a belt.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll call you back with it.</v>

1109
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:24.010
<v Speaker 2>It'd be strutting around in my underwear</v>
<v Speaker 2>with scars all over my body.</v>

1110
00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:28.240
<v Speaker 2>I'd have all the gauze like with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood oozing through all the stitches,</v>

1111
00:49:28.241 --> 00:49:32.290
<v Speaker 2>which I would be fucking covered with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause even if you survive a mountain</v>

<v Speaker 2>you need to fire then unscathed.</v>

<v Speaker 2>this guy who was like in the 18 hundreds</v>

1125
00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:14.980
<v Speaker 2>killed a leopard with his bare hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got attacked by a leopard in Africa</v>

1126
00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.640
<v Speaker 2>and it wasn't a giant one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was big enough to fuck you up</v>

1127
00:50:18.641 --> 00:50:19.240
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1128
00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:23.020
<v Speaker 2>And he was all wrapped up and stitches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing was dead next to him and</v>

1129
00:50:23.021 --> 00:50:24.220
<v Speaker 2>his arms in a slang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1130
00:50:24.221 --> 00:50:27.680
<v Speaker 2>he's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you got fucked up back then you</v>

1131
00:50:27.681 --> 00:50:30.210
<v Speaker 2>got fucked up for keeps like they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>fix it.</v>

1132
00:50:30.211 --> 00:50:34.280
<v Speaker 2>There was no stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have acl surgery.</v>

1133
00:50:34.281 --> 00:50:38.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would literally be crippled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of my knees would be completely</v>

1134
00:50:38.391 --> 00:50:40.400
<v Speaker 2>shot cause I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the guy,</v>

1135
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:42.710
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carl Eight Glee,</v>

1136
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:45.050
<v Speaker 2>a k e.</v>
<v Speaker 2>L.</v>

1137
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.051
<v Speaker 2>E.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Y.</v>

1138
00:50:45.051 --> 00:50:48.890
<v Speaker 2>And they have them down there as bad ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the week and it's got a leopard.</v>

1139
00:50:48.891 --> 00:50:50.510
<v Speaker 2>That shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much you think that weighs?</v>

1140
00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:52.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like 60 pounds.</v>

1141
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:55.340
<v Speaker 2>Get enough to seem like it could be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit dangerous,</v>

1142
00:50:55.341 --> 00:50:57.080
<v Speaker 2>but it also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like you could kind of kill</v>

1143
00:50:57.081 --> 00:50:58.160
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just would suck.</v>

1144
00:50:58.161 --> 00:51:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Like I have to pray to his poor cats</v>
<v Speaker 2>snack Mahmood.</v>

1145
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:02.660
<v Speaker 2>That thing would kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1146
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:04.700
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding me?</v>

1147
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:06.950
<v Speaker 2>Just think of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he'd probably kill me.</v>

1148
00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that guy probably got real</v>

1149
00:51:09.801 --> 00:51:12.590
<v Speaker 2>lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cat was probably sick,</v>

1150
00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:15.200
<v Speaker 2>which is why I was trying to attack and</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill a person the first place.</v>

1151
00:51:15.201 --> 00:51:16.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean that that does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get sick,</v>

1152
00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.140
<v Speaker 2>they get old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1153
00:51:18.141 --> 00:51:20.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes their teeth get worn out and</v>

1154
00:51:20.361 --> 00:51:24.050
<v Speaker 2>they can't kill something big anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the problems with</v>

1155
00:51:24.051 --> 00:51:25.540
<v Speaker 2>certain animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they,</v>

1156
00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:28.010
<v Speaker 2>their predators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start picking on people because</v>

1157
00:51:28.011 --> 00:51:31.660
<v Speaker 2>they can't get animals anymore and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are so goddamn slow.</v>

1158
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:36.320
<v Speaker 2>So what'd he say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt no pain,</v>

1159
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:39.560
<v Speaker 2>but I certainly never thought for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>moment that I would come out alive.</v>

1160
00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I was rather calm as a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except for a tremendous and wildly</v>

1161
00:51:43.821 --> 00:51:47.390
<v Speaker 2>pleasant thrill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt knowing that I was battling for</v>

1162
00:51:47.391 --> 00:51:49.970
<v Speaker 2>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a fucking man.</v>

1163
00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:53.720
<v Speaker 2>What a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why he survived.</v>

1164
00:51:53.721 --> 00:51:54.680
<v Speaker 2>What year was this?</v>

1165
00:51:56.230 --> 00:52:01.230
<v Speaker 8>What does it say it say?</v>
<v Speaker 8>It doesn't say what a fucking</v>

1166
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:06.070
<v Speaker 2>1864 64 and an eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1167
00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.390
<v Speaker 2>he fought an elephant to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got pinned by an elephant.</v>

1168
00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be a dick.</v>

1169
00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably got slammed on the animal</v>

1170
00:52:11.601 --> 00:52:15.220
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking crocodile hunter overs day.</v>

1171
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:19.580
<v Speaker 2>Just threatening animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or you might,</v>

1172
00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:21.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in Africa for a long enough</v>

1173
00:52:21.651 --> 00:52:23.120
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably get jacked.</v>

1174
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:25.760
<v Speaker 2>So he was born in 1865.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how old do you think it wasn't?</v>

1175
00:52:25.761 --> 00:52:27.860
<v Speaker 2>That picture would probably 30 right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:28.641
<v Speaker 2>Scroll up,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's like Kyle Kinane.</v>

1180
00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.073

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1184
00:52:47.191 --> 00:52:48.150
<v Speaker 2>terrified.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He never supposed to have an asshole</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all these feathers all around it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What do you got there,</v>

1205
00:53:35.881 --> 00:53:36.714
<v Speaker 2>Jamie for us?</v>

1206
00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:39.350
<v Speaker 4>See his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Ackley or hour,</v>

1207
00:53:39.351 --> 00:53:43.410
<v Speaker 4>he say his last name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hall of African Mammals in the American</v>

1208
00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:44.790
<v Speaker 4>Museum of Natural History in Manhattan</v>
<v Speaker 4>is upper west side.</v>

1209
00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:46.210
<v Speaker 2>So what was he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was he,</v>

1210
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:50.460
<v Speaker 4>he was like some sort of conservation as</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunter back in the time of like</v>

1211
00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:52.500
<v Speaker 4>Roosevelt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking through this article.</v>

1212
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:54.930
<v Speaker 4>There's another guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems like he was head to head with</v>

1213
00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:57.840
<v Speaker 4>sort of like a Tesla Edison thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's guy named award.</v>

1214
00:53:58.260 --> 00:54:01.650
<v Speaker 4>So they were going around searching and</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting for animals and finding new</v>

1215
00:54:01.651 --> 00:54:04.140
<v Speaker 4>species of things and different in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Congo.</v>

1216
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:04.360
<v Speaker 4>Oh</v>

1217
00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorts of different places like that.</v>

1218
00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:09.850
<v Speaker 2>I was watching this program on Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1219
00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:14.530
<v Speaker 2>last night and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were talking about how the buffalo</v>

1220
00:54:14.531 --> 00:54:16.420
<v Speaker 2>were decimated and how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1221
00:54:16.510 --> 00:54:21.510
<v Speaker 2>they were shipping these truckloads or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>trains train carriage is filled with</v>

1222
00:54:21.731 --> 00:54:26.410
<v Speaker 2>buffalo meat back to the east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buffalo meat became high in demand and</v>

1223
00:54:26.411 --> 00:54:30.580
<v Speaker 2>then buffalo hides were high in demand</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were showing in this,</v>

1224
00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:35.640
<v Speaker 2>this thing that I was watching stacks of</v>
<v Speaker 2>skins just stacks of skins and of</v>

1225
00:54:38.081 --> 00:54:39.790
<v Speaker 2>skulls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you just look at her like,</v>

1226
00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:42.070
<v Speaker 2>what the F,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you do this?</v>

1227
00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:44.950
<v Speaker 2>How did you guys not think that this was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a terrible idea?</v>

1228
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:47.530
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get those stacks of skulls.</v>

1229
00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:51.430
<v Speaker 2>This is stacks that go all the way up to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the top of that railroad cart.</v>

1230
00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:53.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking bananas.</v>

1231
00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Stacks of skins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at these skins.</v>

1232
00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:01.390
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would just wiping out hundreds of</v>

1233
00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:03.940
<v Speaker 2>thousands of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how many did they wipe out a year?</v>

1234
00:55:03.941 --> 00:55:08.941
<v Speaker 2>Because you got to assume like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff is probably recently come off the</v>

1235
00:55:08.981 --> 00:55:12.460
<v Speaker 2>animal that says it's 40,000 buffalo</v>
<v Speaker 2>hides right there.</v>

1236
00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:16.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so crazy what they did.</v>

1237
00:55:17.590 --> 00:55:19.090
<v Speaker 2>They're going to get this guy on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

1238
00:55:19.091 --> 00:55:22.180
<v Speaker 2>His name's Dan Flores and I found out</v>
<v Speaker 2>about them from Steve Rinella and he has</v>

1239
00:55:22.181 --> 00:55:24.700
<v Speaker 2>a very interesting hypothesis or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1240
00:55:24.701 --> 00:55:26.710
<v Speaker 2>he's a scientist so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1241
00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.440
<v Speaker 2>he has an a and a historian I believe as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1242
00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:32.620
<v Speaker 2>So he has maybe not a scientist either</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1243
00:55:33.370 --> 00:55:37.900
<v Speaker 2>His take on what happened with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>buffalo is essentially my butcher,</v>

1244
00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:41.650
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that when the first Europeans came</v>

1245
00:55:41.651 --> 00:55:45.550
<v Speaker 2>to North America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't find evidence of Buffalo.</v>

1246
00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:48.040
<v Speaker 2>They talked about everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He talked about bear,</v>

1247
00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:50.500
<v Speaker 2>they talked about deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talked about elk,</v>

1248
00:55:50.530 --> 00:55:52.930
<v Speaker 2>they talked about all these different</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals that we know exist here,</v>

1249
00:55:52.931 --> 00:55:55.870
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't really talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>buffalo and the,</v>

1250
00:55:55.871 --> 00:56:00.871
<v Speaker 2>he believes that with the sheer numbers</v>
<v Speaker 2>of buffalo that that existed a hundred</v>

1251
00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:01.570
<v Speaker 2>years later.</v>

1252
00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:04.960
<v Speaker 2>It seems highly improbable that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't talk about him.</v>

1253
00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:10.260
<v Speaker 2>And his take is that what happened was</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Europeans started showing up in</v>

1254
00:56:10.301 --> 00:56:13.090
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they brought with them a lot of diseases</v>

1255
00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:17.740
<v Speaker 2>and those diseases that they gave these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people these like first of all,</v>

1256
00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:21.490
<v Speaker 2>like there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a common myth apparently that</v>

1257
00:56:21.491 --> 00:56:26.491
<v Speaker 2>they gave them syphilis in the form of</v>
<v Speaker 2>scabs in blankets and they put scabs and</v>

1258
00:56:26.561 --> 00:56:28.150
<v Speaker 2>blankets and game to the native</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>

1259
00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.860
<v Speaker 2>As far as I know that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

1260
00:56:32.861 --> 00:56:37.861
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know about bacteria then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know what that you know that</v>

1261
00:56:38.111 --> 00:56:39.730
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how it was spread.</v>

1262
00:56:39.731 --> 00:56:42.370
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know that you would give</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone a scab and that the actual</v>

1263
00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.250
<v Speaker 2>tissue from the scab would cause the</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>

1264
00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:49.690
<v Speaker 2>The knowledge of like how diseases were</v>
<v Speaker 2>spread was not that sophisticated back</v>

1265
00:56:49.691 --> 00:56:51.220
<v Speaker 2>then as far as what I read.</v>

1266
00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:55.420
<v Speaker 2>But what he's saying is that when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europeans came here and they introduced</v>

1267
00:56:55.421 --> 00:56:59.410
<v Speaker 2>these new diseases that they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the natives didn't have any immune</v>

1268
00:56:59.411 --> 00:57:03.130
<v Speaker 2>systems for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it fucking devastated the population and</v>

1269
00:57:03.131 --> 00:57:06.850
<v Speaker 2>he said that that is responsible for as</v>
<v Speaker 2>many deaths as anything else to the</v>

1270
00:57:06.851 --> 00:57:10.720
<v Speaker 2>native Americans that lived here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just got fucking completely wiped</v>

1271
00:57:10.721 --> 00:57:14.200
<v Speaker 2>out by European diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When that happened,</v>

1272
00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:18.630
<v Speaker 2>the native Americans were responsible</v>
<v Speaker 2>for keeping the buffalo populations and</v>

1273
00:57:18.631 --> 00:57:21.760
<v Speaker 2>check and had been doing so pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>efficiently.</v>

1274
00:57:21.761 --> 00:57:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Ever since that the horse was brought to</v>
<v Speaker 2>North America because before the</v>

1275
00:57:26.261 --> 00:57:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Europeans came here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>native Americans didn't have horses.</v>

1276
00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:32.380
<v Speaker 2>They were on horses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the horses that,</v>

1277
00:57:32.381 --> 00:57:33.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we depict the wild west,</v>

1278
00:57:33.911 --> 00:57:36.610
<v Speaker 2>that native Americans rider on the horse</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how they've always been,</v>

1279
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.690
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1280
00:57:37.691 --> 00:57:39.850
<v Speaker 2>They were always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1281
00:57:39.851 --> 00:57:43.540
<v Speaker 2>like really nomadic people that live in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brazil or something like that in the</v>

1282
00:57:43.541 --> 00:57:45.760
<v Speaker 2>rain forest or Ecuador or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1283
00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:49.630
<v Speaker 2>They weren't on horses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they got the horses from the North</v>

1284
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:51.670
<v Speaker 2>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also got the diseases and while</v>

1285
00:57:51.671 --> 00:57:54.460
<v Speaker 2>they hand the horses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were on the way to,</v>

1286
00:57:54.461 --> 00:57:58.450
<v Speaker 2>in his words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extra painting the buffalo from their</v>

1287
00:57:58.451 --> 00:58:01.240
<v Speaker 2>domain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means it local extinction.</v>

1288
00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:04.660
<v Speaker 2>So they were already doing such an</v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient job of killing the buffalo</v>

1289
00:58:04.661 --> 00:58:08.740
<v Speaker 2>from horses because they'd run up on</v>
<v Speaker 2>horses and just fucking Arrow the shit</v>

1290
00:58:08.741 --> 00:58:11.530
<v Speaker 2>out of these buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were ruthlessly effective cause</v>

1291
00:58:11.531 --> 00:58:13.990
<v Speaker 2>they were on a horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they could get that horse right up at</v>

1292
00:58:13.991 --> 00:58:17.560
<v Speaker 2>the buffalo because of Buffalo's full</v>
<v Speaker 2>clip is about 40 miles an hour.</v>

1293
00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:19.750
<v Speaker 2>But a horse can run about 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60,</v>

1294
00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:22.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially like a really strong</v>

1295
00:58:22.481 --> 00:58:25.870
<v Speaker 2>wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these guys would just run up on these</v>

1296
00:58:25.871 --> 00:58:28.660
<v Speaker 2>fucking herds of buffalo and blast them</v>
<v Speaker 2>with arrows and kill them.</v>

1297
00:58:28.661 --> 00:58:31.810
<v Speaker 2>And then they got guns and once they got</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns,</v>

1298
00:58:31.811 --> 00:58:34.480
<v Speaker 2>good googly Mowgli between horses and</v>
<v Speaker 2>rifles.</v>

1299
00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean they were fucking these buffalo</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1300
00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:41.080
<v Speaker 2>So what happened was they got almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>wiped out and the buffalo came back</v>

1301
00:58:41.081 --> 00:58:44.380
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they saw these millions of</v>

1302
00:58:44.381 --> 00:58:46.930
<v Speaker 2>buffalo out on these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these prairies,</v>

1303
00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:51.910
<v Speaker 2>that was an over abundance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a rare cycle in time that</v>

1304
00:58:51.911 --> 00:58:54.280
<v Speaker 2>corresponded with the death of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>native Americans.</v>

1305
00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:55.690
<v Speaker 2>And this is his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1306
00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:59.800
<v Speaker 2>his paper that he wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buffalo Ecology,</v>

1307
00:58:59.801 --> 00:59:03.520
<v Speaker 2>I think something something Buffalo</v>
<v Speaker 2>ecologies name is Dan Flores.</v>

1308
00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:05.980
<v Speaker 2>See if we could find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one of those university</v>

1309
00:59:05.981 --> 00:59:08.740
<v Speaker 2>papers though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you probably have to have a some</v>

1310
00:59:08.741 --> 00:59:12.220
<v Speaker 2>sort of a membership and it's like one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of those things that that kid got in</v>

1311
00:59:12.221 --> 00:59:16.330
<v Speaker 2>trouble for releasing for free or that</v>
<v Speaker 2>kid that wound up killing himself.</v>

1312
00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pdf or you can get others a pdf,</v>

1313
00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:22.790
<v Speaker 2>what does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bison and bison diplomacy.</v>

1314
00:59:22.791 --> 00:59:27.200
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The southern plains from 1800 to 1850</v>

1315
00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:30.080
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting stuff because you</v>

1316
00:59:30.081 --> 00:59:32.210
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're finding out more and more about</v>

1317
00:59:32.211 --> 00:59:35.690
<v Speaker 2>the history of this country obviously</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we still have Columbus Day.</v>

1318
00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:39.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean the fact that we still have a day</v>
<v Speaker 2>named after guy who didn't even get</v>

1319
00:59:39.261 --> 00:59:41.480
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know he landed in the West indies,</v>

1320
00:59:41.481 --> 00:59:43.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that where he landed in The</v>

1321
00:59:43.370 --> 00:59:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Bahamas or some shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether things do you think are on the</v>

1322
00:59:45.351 --> 00:59:47.300
<v Speaker 2>way out and Columbus Day is definitely</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the way.</v>

1323
00:59:47.301 --> 00:59:49.400
<v Speaker 2>It should have been out a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a murderer.</v>

1324
00:59:49.430 --> 00:59:52.190
<v Speaker 2>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbus as a mass murderer.</v>

1325
00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:57.230
<v Speaker 2>If you go to collage to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a missionary or someone that</v>

1326
00:59:57.231 --> 01:00:01.700
<v Speaker 2>was there at the time of Columbus that</v>
<v Speaker 2>detailed the horrors of what they did to</v>

1327
01:00:01.701 --> 01:00:03.440
<v Speaker 2>the native American people that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>found,</v>

1328
01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.510
<v Speaker 2>which to try to get these people to give</v>
<v Speaker 2>them gold.</v>

1329
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:10.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean the fucking whores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would cut off body parts and send</v>

1330
01:00:10.761 --> 01:00:12.800
<v Speaker 2>these people out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would cut their arms off if they</v>

1331
01:00:12.801 --> 01:00:15.310
<v Speaker 2>didn't bring back a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight and gold,</v>

1332
01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:17.690
<v Speaker 2>they would smash babies on the rocks.</v>

1333
01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:20.180
<v Speaker 2>They would take their children from them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and smash them in the rocks.</v>

1334
01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:25.380
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about boat boats filled</v>
<v Speaker 2>with serial killers and we have,</v>

1335
01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:31.330

<v Speaker 2>for a guy who ran a boat of serial</v>

1336
01:00:31.431 --> 01:00:36.431
<v Speaker 2>killers that came across the ocean and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just laid waste to everybody in front of</v>

<v Speaker 2>Another John Dudley story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John who was here yesterday,</v>

1497
01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:58.620
<v Speaker 2>he saw a bear kill a moose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was there when a grizzly swatted a</v>

1498
01:06:59.801 --> 01:07:02.720
<v Speaker 2>moose in the back and broke it's back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1499
01:07:02.770 --> 01:07:06.550
<v Speaker 2>He said the bear was chasing the Mousse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It got the,</v>

1500
01:07:06.551 --> 01:07:11.170
<v Speaker 2>they got into conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bear got on top of him and swatted</v>

1501
01:07:11.171 --> 01:07:12.460
<v Speaker 2>is back and broke it.</v>

1502
01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:15.640
<v Speaker 2>He said he broke his back with one</v>
<v Speaker 2>swipe.</v>

1503
01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also talked about this cabin that</v>

1504
01:07:18.611 --> 01:07:21.610
<v Speaker 2>they had in the woods where this bare</v>
<v Speaker 2>broken in the cabin,</v>

1505
01:07:21.611 --> 01:07:25.750
<v Speaker 2>pulled the wall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled the doorframe and the door off</v>

1506
01:07:25.751 --> 01:07:28.390
<v Speaker 2>the wall with these nine inch spike</v>
<v Speaker 2>nails all around it.</v>

1507
01:07:28.510 --> 01:07:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Then there was a stove inside that</v>
<v Speaker 2>smelled like food.</v>

1508
01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:36.600
<v Speaker 2>He crushed the stove to the ground like</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would stomp on a soda can just to</v>

1509
01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:40.180
<v Speaker 2>ooze out whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fat and grease was inside the</v>

1510
01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:42.700
<v Speaker 2>stove.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck bears man.</v>

1511
01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:46.410
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So crazy that we want more of those are</v>

1512
01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:48.820
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to save those when you need them</v>

1513
01:07:48.821 --> 01:07:50.680
<v Speaker 2>everywhere and the wolves to were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1514
01:07:50.681 --> 01:07:51.730
<v Speaker 2>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so awesome.</v>

1515
01:07:51.731 --> 01:07:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Keeping that things a killing machine</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking right through your eyes.</v>

1516
01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:57.550
<v Speaker 2>It's cool that they exist though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1517
01:07:57.551 --> 01:08:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would be kind of cool of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dinosaurs were still rare here too.</v>

1518
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.580
<v Speaker 2>If there was like a real Jurassic</v>
<v Speaker 2>island,</v>

1519
01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:04.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suck.</v>

1520
01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:07.390
<v Speaker 2>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Long as you didn't have to go there.</v>

1521
01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.760
<v Speaker 2>If it was like an island like New</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zealand.</v>

1522
01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1523
01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:12.910
<v Speaker 2>The Middle Past Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guam.</v>

1524
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well New Zealand is huge.</v>

1525
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Probably not New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would want to do that to those two.</v>

1526
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can get too big.</v>

1527
01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:20.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a New Zealand.</v>

1528
01:08:20.581 --> 01:08:25.581
<v Speaker 2>It was like crazy wildlife situation</v>
<v Speaker 2>because New Zealand is a fairly recent</v>

1529
01:08:25.731 --> 01:08:29.870
<v Speaker 2>continent or island as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as like the volcano volcanic</v>

1530
01:08:29.871 --> 01:08:32.630
<v Speaker 2>activity of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't a lot of land masses</v>

1531
01:08:32.631 --> 01:08:36.950
<v Speaker 2>connecting it to other places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have some indigenous wildlife,</v>

1532
01:08:36.951 --> 01:08:41.240
<v Speaker 2>like a bunch of weird animals and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also have a lot of stuff that</v>

1533
01:08:41.241 --> 01:08:45.350
<v Speaker 2>is non native that was brought in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all these a hunting animals.</v>

1534
01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:48.110
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these really rich dudes a long time ago,</v>

1535
01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:53.270
<v Speaker 2>basically turn New Zealand into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting preserve and they just let these</v>

1536
01:08:53.271 --> 01:08:56.170
<v Speaker 2>stags loose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These European dear,</v>

1537
01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:59.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these red deer and stags tags is like,</v>

1538
01:08:59.391 --> 01:09:02.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a European form of elk and a,</v>

1539
01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:04.970
<v Speaker 2>they let all these things loose all</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout New Zealand,</v>

1540
01:09:04.971 --> 01:09:08.090
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have any mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want any bobcat's.</v>

1541
01:09:08.091 --> 01:09:09.980
<v Speaker 2>They don't have wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough coyotes that,</v>

1542
01:09:09.981 --> 01:09:13.550
<v Speaker 2>of anything that kills these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they have to send people out there to</v>

1543
01:09:13.551 --> 01:09:15.230
<v Speaker 2>kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people just killing them</v>

1544
01:09:15.231 --> 01:09:17.570
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when some of the populations of some</v>

1545
01:09:17.571 --> 01:09:20.690
<v Speaker 2>of the animals get too high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to fly over him and fucking</v>

1546
01:09:20.691 --> 01:09:21.920
<v Speaker 2>gun him down from the sky.</v>

1547
01:09:22.190 --> 01:09:24.110
<v Speaker 5>They're having this problem right now</v>
<v Speaker 5>with Cat Island,</v>

1548
01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:27.470
<v Speaker 5>which is that island of cats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alpha Japan and there are the,</v>

1549
01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:30.110
<v Speaker 5>and they're in breeding like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's scary.</v>

1550
01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:33.410
<v Speaker 5>All these cats like thousands and</v>
<v Speaker 5>thousands of cats just live on this</v>

1551
01:09:33.411 --> 01:09:35.480
<v Speaker 5>island must smell like shit by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I suppose.</v>

1552
01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:36.600
<v Speaker 5>Smells like ammonia pissed,</v>

1553
01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.590
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see what's going on with</v>

1554
01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Fukushima?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fukushima has a problem with radioactive</v>

1555
01:09:44.331 --> 01:09:46.670
<v Speaker 2>wild boars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

1556
01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:51.110
<v Speaker 2>There's like hundreds of radioactive</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild boars that have taken over that</v>

1557
01:09:51.111 --> 01:09:53.300
<v Speaker 2>area because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people aren't really there anymore</v>

1558
01:09:53.690 --> 01:09:56.510
<v Speaker 2>and they're running rampant and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a problem with them.</v>

1559
01:09:56.511 --> 01:09:59.780
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have radioactive wild pigs.</v>

1560
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:02.900
<v Speaker 2>Look at this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thousands of,</v>

1561
01:10:02.901 --> 01:10:03.770
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said hundreds.</v>

1562
01:10:03.771 --> 01:10:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Thousands of radioactive boars are</v>
<v Speaker 2>overrunning farmland in Fukushima.</v>

1563
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:10.970
<v Speaker 2>But look at the photos of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have some photos of these fucking</v>

1564
01:10:10.971 --> 01:10:13.040
<v Speaker 2>bores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1565
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.660
<v Speaker 2>maybe different article.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1566
01:10:14.690 --> 01:10:16.430
<v Speaker 2>Here's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be stock footage though.</v>

1567
01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wild boar stock seat on the fucking</v>

1568
01:10:18.711 --> 01:10:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Internet wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

1569
01:10:20.270 --> 01:10:23.030
<v Speaker 2>I know it's probably all the photos are</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably stock,</v>

1570
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:27.770
<v Speaker 2>but there was one video of this guy who</v>
<v Speaker 2>had like a radioactive suit on like he</v>

1571
01:10:27.771 --> 01:10:31.460
<v Speaker 2>was some sort of a scientist and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>bores were chasing him.</v>

1572
01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all look stock,</v>

1573
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:35.280
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>

1575
01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:42.650
<v Speaker 2>What is this other radioactive dudes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those the a,</v>

1576
01:10:42.651 --> 01:10:46.700
<v Speaker 2>the board themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a real problem.</v>

1577
01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Those things start turning into like</v>
<v Speaker 2>some comic book,</v>

1578
01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Superhero type character powers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they could things of radioactive,</v>

1579
01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:59.720
<v Speaker 2>like what if they start morphing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it becomes super smart because</v>

1580
01:10:59.721 --> 01:11:02.780
<v Speaker 2>we already know that boards are smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like pigs are supposed to be smarter</v>

1581
01:11:02.781 --> 01:11:03.614
<v Speaker 2>than dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Lots of them slamming into the fucking</v>

1584
01:11:12.051 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 2>fence trying to get out of this cage and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they caught him in.</v>

1585
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:16.670
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>

1586
01:11:16.671 --> 01:11:17.780
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>

1587
01:11:17.781 --> 01:11:20.390
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that thing is still leaking</v>

1588
01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:24.950
<v Speaker 2>thousands of gallons of radioactive shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the water every day</v>

1589
01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.340
<v Speaker 5>isn't California.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we still have that gas leak up and</v>

1590
01:11:27.341 --> 01:11:29.890
<v Speaker 5>send me valley or wherever that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did they?</v>

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:35.030
<v Speaker 2>but that was bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said it was like every car in the</v>

1593
01:11:35.031 --> 01:11:36.800
<v Speaker 2>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emissions from every car in the</v>

1594
01:11:36.801 --> 01:11:38.840
<v Speaker 2>United States in one day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1595

1596
01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:44.630
<v Speaker 2>FYI.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Powerful desk squad cop.</v>

1597
01:11:44.631 --> 01:11:48.860
<v Speaker 2>I liked this one man that I'm drinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of available right now at death</v>

1598

<v Speaker 2>Brian Red band creations.</v>

1600
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:53.920
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's fun stuff.</v>

1601
01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:55.000
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1602
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.520
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you remember when we used to talk about</v>

1603
01:11:57.521 --> 01:11:59.500
<v Speaker 5>that radioactive up there and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

1604
01:11:59.501 --> 01:12:02.640
<v Speaker 5>the thing I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's funny because I know somebody or I</v>

1605
01:12:02.650 --> 01:12:05.320
<v Speaker 5>met these triplets the other day that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that grew up there.</v>

1606
01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:08.560
<v Speaker 5>What do you think the odds are that</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're triplets because they grew up</v>

1607
01:12:08.561 --> 01:12:11.530
<v Speaker 5>near that radioactive?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What makes triplets?</v>

1608
01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:16.360
<v Speaker 5>It's a real good question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think horse the horse,</v>

1609
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:20.780
<v Speaker 2>you just have to love Dick so much that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take in so much calm that there's</v>

1610
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:23.960
<v Speaker 2>this calm just rushes and no one egg</v>
<v Speaker 2>wins.</v>

1611
01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a a dude who's just got a lot of</v>

1612
01:12:27.321 --> 01:12:29.450
<v Speaker 2>calm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what makes me super</v>

1613
01:12:29.451 --> 01:12:30.000
<v Speaker 2>aggressive.</v>

1614
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.950
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] people that have triplets my</v>
<v Speaker 5>age.</v>

1615
01:12:31.951 --> 01:12:35.580
<v Speaker 5>But I think nowadays it's probably more</v>
<v Speaker 5>for like maybe they might be using</v>

1616
01:12:35.581 --> 01:12:37.980
<v Speaker 5>fertility thing or two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you take like an accident they had</v>

1617
01:12:37.981 --> 01:12:38.814
<v Speaker 5>three and the only one is right.</v>

1618
01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:41.370
<v Speaker 2>That definitely happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That happens with the older ladies.</v>

1619
01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.720
<v Speaker 2>That's like John and kate plus eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that chicken like seven fucking</v>

1620
01:12:45.721 --> 01:12:48.780
<v Speaker 2>babies inside of her and when they know</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight inside of her and then two</v>

1621
01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:52.770
<v Speaker 2>additionally they had to first and</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided they wanted more and so they</v>

1622
01:12:52.771 --> 01:12:55.560
<v Speaker 2>fill themselves up with babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1623
01:12:55.570 --> 01:12:58.920
<v Speaker 2>I remember that show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy that was an interesting show because</v>

1624
01:12:58.921 --> 01:13:03.921
<v Speaker 2>that was a show that kind of showed how</v>
<v Speaker 2>much pressure of the average person gets</v>

1625
01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:09.810
<v Speaker 2>under when you're under the microscope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people that behave like totally</v>

1626
01:13:09.811 --> 01:13:11.880
<v Speaker 2>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think their behavior is totally</v>

1627
01:13:11.881 --> 01:13:13.050
<v Speaker 2>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then all of sudden they're under the</v>

1628
01:13:13.051 --> 01:13:17.700
<v Speaker 2>microscope and the whole world sees that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they get criticized and freaked</v>

1629
01:13:17.701 --> 01:13:20.760
<v Speaker 2>on and then next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't handle it anymore and they</v>

1630
01:13:20.761 --> 01:13:22.620
<v Speaker 2>break up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then John,</v>

1631
01:13:22.621 --> 01:13:24.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was forced to get like regular jobs and</v>

1632
01:13:24.781 --> 01:13:26.880
<v Speaker 2>catch them dating women and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1633
01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:28.980
<v Speaker 2>they would let hound the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

1634
01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really ugly.</v>

1635
01:13:30.570 --> 01:13:31.410
<v Speaker 2>As real ugly.</v>

1636
01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:32.430
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1637
01:13:32.430 --> 01:13:34.530
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're poor fucking kids,</v>

1638
01:13:34.531 --> 01:13:35.364
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1639
01:13:35.610 --> 01:13:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1640
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess they had six.</v>

1641
01:13:40.020 --> 01:13:40.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1642
01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.190
<v Speaker 2>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1643
01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:43.770
<v Speaker 2>they had two previous than they had six</v>
<v Speaker 2>babies inside of her.</v>

1644
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:45.930
<v Speaker 2>And that's all those fertility drugs for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1645
01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:49.170
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird,</v>

1646
01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:51.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's also weird because I'm</v>

1647
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:53.490
<v Speaker 2>pretty sure they were strictly</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious,</v>

1648
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.710
<v Speaker 2>weren't thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I feel like that's when it</v>

1649
01:13:55.711 --> 01:13:56.640
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1650
01:13:56.850 --> 01:14:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Well not really because see like God</v>
<v Speaker 2>says be fruitful and multiply,</v>

1651
01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:05.220
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't say anything about taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>fertility drugs in order to make that</v>

1652
01:14:05.221 --> 01:14:06.720
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1653
01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:10.050
<v Speaker 2>And if it's God's plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it all God's plan when a scientist</v>

1654
01:14:10.051 --> 01:14:11.590
<v Speaker 2>steps in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it God's plan?</v>

1655
01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Because a scientist is here that God</v>
<v Speaker 2>make the scientist,</v>

1656
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:16.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do you draw the line as far as</v>

1657
01:14:16.211 --> 01:14:18.130
<v Speaker 2>like what God wants because if that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>

1658
01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:20.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone invented abortion.</v>

1659
01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Was it God's plan to make abortion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was God's plan for everything</v>

1660
01:14:23.910 --> 01:14:26.970
<v Speaker 4>and a multiple families for I'm from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause if like Catholic family raised</v>

1661
01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:29.430

<v Speaker 4>I know at least three families that have</v>

1662
01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:30.330
<v Speaker 4>10 12 kids.</v>

1663
01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:32.850
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horse horse.</v>

1664
01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:36.600

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>how you like shoot yourself in the all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pis and everything comes out if you</v>

1673
01:14:56.671 --> 01:14:57.690
<v Speaker 2>have any in you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1674
01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean surely there's something that you</v>

1675
01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:01.830
<v Speaker 2>have an anal sex with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A girl likes to do meth.</v>

1676
01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:04.350
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said that's the way to go because</v>

1677
01:15:04.351 --> 01:15:05.150
<v Speaker 2>they don't eat.</v>

1678
01:15:05.150 --> 01:15:06.350
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

1679
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Brian is a light bulb went off about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>math.</v>

1680
01:15:10.290 --> 01:15:12.300
<v Speaker 2>They don't eat and their apartments are</v>
<v Speaker 2>squeaky clean.</v>

1681
01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:16.290
<v Speaker 2>All they do is clean their apartments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just thinking of how realistic</v>

1682
01:15:16.291 --> 01:15:17.880
<v Speaker 2>would it be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that Jesus on the cross,</v>

1683
01:15:17.881 --> 01:15:20.600
<v Speaker 2>if it was realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was just shit and piss everywhere</v>

1684
01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:24.480
<v Speaker 2>on the bottom of the cross and it cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though they probably definitely be</v>

1685
01:15:24.481 --> 01:15:27.180
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine if they fed them before</v>

1686
01:15:27.181 --> 01:15:30.480
<v Speaker 2>they strung him up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting too because they always</v>

1687
01:15:30.481 --> 01:15:33.510
<v Speaker 2>show the crucifixion marks through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands,</v>

1688
01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.840
<v Speaker 2>but apparently that's not capable of</v>
<v Speaker 2>supporting your body.</v>

1689
01:15:36.841 --> 01:15:38.210
<v Speaker 2>They go through the wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1690
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

1691
01:15:40.561 --> 01:15:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's how you hang a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go through the,</v>

1692
01:15:43.621 --> 01:15:46.510
<v Speaker 2>the ligament behind the knee and you put</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a stick through it and you get to</v>

1693
01:15:46.511 --> 01:15:46.960
<v Speaker 2>hang up.</v>

1694
01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.910
<v Speaker 4>No suffocation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The way I would have hung his body.</v>

1695
01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:52.570
<v Speaker 4>He would have suffocated in a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours instead of days because the way</v>

1696
01:15:52.571 --> 01:15:53.291
<v Speaker 4>the honey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1697
01:15:53.291 --> 01:15:55.710
<v Speaker 4>the way your body would have hung the</v>
<v Speaker 4>weight on your diaphragm or something</v>

1698
01:15:55.711 --> 01:15:58.120
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was too much in Catholic religion</v>

1699
01:15:58.150 --> 01:15:59.890
<v Speaker 4>class to have all this stuff explained</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1700
01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:02.280
<v Speaker 4>Now I've learned extra stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1701
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:03.890
<v Speaker 2>what uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1702
01:16:03.891 --> 01:16:07.370
<v Speaker 2>there was a story that Danieli Bolelli</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1703
01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:10.400
<v Speaker 2>of history on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got an awesome podcast history on</v>

1704
01:16:10.401 --> 01:16:14.300
<v Speaker 2>fire and the opening podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a pilot like episode zero zero</v>

1705
01:16:14.301 --> 01:16:16.670
<v Speaker 2>and then he says episode one in episode</v>
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

1706
01:16:16.671 --> 01:16:21.671
<v Speaker 2>he tells a story that he told on this</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast about this.</v>

1707
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was the Romans had hung up</v>

1708
01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:31.310
<v Speaker 2>some insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a hundred miles of bodies,</v>

1709
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:33.230
<v Speaker 2>something crazy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what was the,</v>

1710
01:16:33.231 --> 01:16:36.620
<v Speaker 2>the actual number I remember your till</v>
<v Speaker 2>is saying that right now it was like the</v>

1711
01:16:36.621 --> 01:16:37.500
<v Speaker 2>hymn sing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1712
01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:41.900
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole pathway or the whole road</v>
<v Speaker 2>to wherever it was a hundred miles or</v>

1713
01:16:41.901 --> 01:16:46.040
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it was was just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>every x amount of meters.</v>

1714
01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:51.370
<v Speaker 2>They had a body that was crucified all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all along the road.</v>

1715
01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.260
<v Speaker 2>The like that was how people used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>roll back then.</v>

1716
01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:56.300
<v Speaker 2>They used to scare the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1717
01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:59.870
<v Speaker 2>There was no like hiding the photos of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the caskets.</v>

1718
01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:00.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1719
01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:04.130
<v Speaker 2>they hung people on sticks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuffed them into the ground.</v>

1720
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Spartacus road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>6,000 spartacus,</v>

1721
01:17:07.010 --> 01:17:09.710
<v Speaker 2>6,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the same thing.</v>

1722
01:17:10.670 --> 01:17:14.660
<v Speaker 2>They crucified 6,000 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

1723
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:17.900
<v Speaker 2>People were Baroud back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1724
01:17:17.901 --> 01:17:20.440
<v Speaker 2>I guess they're brutal today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>him with a drone.</v>

1745
01:18:08.981 --> 01:18:13.450
<v Speaker 2>trees to protect his family because no</v>

<v Speaker 2>thinkpads.</v>

1853
01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:40.360
<v Speaker 2>I read this review of a Lenovo thinkpad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has 15 hours of battery life that's</v>

1854
01:22:40.521 --> 01:22:44.240
<v Speaker 2>supposed to have them the most tactile</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling keyboard.</v>

1855
01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:47.400
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>di did a review of it and he said that</v>

1856
01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:50.150
<v Speaker 2>the keyboard itself I saved at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second,</v>

1857
01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:55.340
<v Speaker 2>he said that the keyboard itself was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>good that it actually upped his words</v>

1858
01:22:55.341 --> 01:22:57.620
<v Speaker 2>per minute faster than his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>How is that even possible?</v>

1861
01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.040

<v Speaker 2>but it seems like bullshit.</v>

1862
01:23:04.190 --> 01:23:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Who does that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we say that Lenovo thinkpad t 50</v>

<v Speaker 2>review and it's on Laptop magazine.</v>

1864
01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:15.580

<v Speaker 2>deal with windows.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1870
01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.030

<v Speaker 2>I'm just bored.</v>

1872
01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:35.170
<v Speaker 2>I just want to try something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that apple and also you can take</v>

1873
01:23:35.171 --> 01:23:37.570
<v Speaker 2>the battery out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have a separate battery.</v>

1874
01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:38.920
<v Speaker 2>You remember when you could do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1875
01:23:38.921 --> 01:23:41.770
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the fact that you keep a fucking</v>

1876
01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:44.280
<v Speaker 2>full battery with you on that came up</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there,</v>

1877
01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:48.340
<v Speaker 2>that's their kind of pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's lg or slide in slide out</v>

1878
01:23:48.341 --> 01:23:49.600
<v Speaker 2>battery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it comes with the next one.</v>

1879
01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my galaxy until the recent one,</v>

1880
01:23:52.631 --> 01:23:56.200
<v Speaker 2>my Samsung Galaxy had that and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>waterproof and you can take the battery</v>

1881
01:23:56.201 --> 01:23:56.530
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1882
01:23:56.530 --> 01:24:00.820
<v Speaker 2>It was still waterproof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goddammit keys to be able to carry an</v>

1883
01:24:00.821 --> 01:24:03.640
<v Speaker 2>extra battery it in your laptop bag and</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1884
01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:05.620
<v Speaker 2>your laptop was running out of battery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Close it,</v>

1885
01:24:05.621 --> 01:24:07.360
<v Speaker 2>pop that bitch out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop the new end.</v>

1886
01:24:07.361 --> 01:24:10.120
<v Speaker 2>You're back in action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fully loaded.</v>

1887
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:11.980
<v Speaker 2>But now you have those like portable</v>
<v Speaker 2>charger,</v>

1888
01:24:11.981 --> 01:24:14.770
<v Speaker 2>battery chargers and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of unnecessary.</v>

1889
01:24:14.771 --> 01:24:17.080
<v Speaker 2>What's really interesting is as good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>iphone,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Your iphone.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>But I had,</v>

1895
01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:30.190
<v Speaker 2>when I went hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought one with me that I didn't even</v>

1899
01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The end of the day,</v>

1900
01:24:38.981 --> 01:24:41.710
<v Speaker 2>you've walked 14 miles up mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're exhausted.</v>

1901
01:24:41.711 --> 01:24:44.530
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take a shit in the woods,</v>

<v Speaker 2>go back to your tent,</v>

1903
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:49.080
<v Speaker 2>pass out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

1904
01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:51.930
<v Speaker 2>I carried it around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was probably like at least 10 pounds.</v>

1905
01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:54.820
<v Speaker 2>It was huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it worked.</v>

1906
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Worked when you need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>IPAD,</v>

1907
01:24:58.090 --> 01:24:59.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1908
01:24:59.201 --> 01:25:00.060
<v Speaker 2>fuck I pads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I like a button,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1910
01:25:01.481 --> 01:25:03.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a tactile person.</v>

1911
01:25:03.220 --> 01:25:05.450
<v Speaker 2>I like to feel buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like even I,</v>

1912
01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:07.450
<v Speaker 2>it took me a long time to get used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the iphone,</v>

1913
01:25:07.451 --> 01:25:10.510
<v Speaker 2>but the iphone is benefits of touching</v>
<v Speaker 2>the screen.</v>

1914
01:25:11.020 --> 01:25:12.910
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having the full screen real estate for</v>

1915
01:25:12.911 --> 01:25:15.610
<v Speaker 2>videos and photographs and email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so worth it.</v>

1916
01:25:15.730 --> 01:25:18.840
<v Speaker 2>It's so worth it because I know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>blackberry came out with a new one with</v>

1917
01:25:18.841 --> 01:25:22.480
<v Speaker 2>a giant ass screen and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing slides out the bottom and then</v>

1918
01:25:22.481 --> 01:25:24.920
<v Speaker 2>you have a keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not pioneer.</v>

1919
01:25:25.390 --> 01:25:29.080
<v Speaker 2>No enough is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could just get the ipad pro with a</v>

1920
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:30.300
<v Speaker 2>keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a real keyboard.</v>

1921
01:25:30.330 --> 01:25:32.890
<v Speaker 2>My snap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't save files.</v>

1922
01:25:32.970 --> 01:25:33.791
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1923
01:25:33.791 --> 01:25:35.770
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't like put like Microsoft word</v>

1924
01:25:35.771 --> 01:25:38.370
<v Speaker 2>files in a folder on your desktop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1925
01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:40.450
<v Speaker 2>they have Microsoft word now on your</v>
<v Speaker 2>desktop,</v>

1926
01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:42.970
<v Speaker 2>but you can put it in the cloud</v>
<v Speaker 2>equivalent thing.</v>

1927
01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:47.340
<v Speaker 2>You can nowadays it close to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean close to that?</v>

1928
01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:50.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it go in the cloud or is it uh,</v>

1929
01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:53.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably is saved on your ipad but I</v>

1930
01:25:53.651 --> 01:25:57.050
<v Speaker 2>bet you could use like the docs app for</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google or something like that.</v>

1931
01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pages for that's on that and you can</v>

1932
01:25:59.441 --> 01:26:01.690
<v Speaker 2>save it on something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So offline use,</v>

1933
01:26:01.691 --> 01:26:06.691
<v Speaker 2>it's cached and the new force speaker</v>
<v Speaker 2>system on the ipad pro is bad ass.</v>

1934
01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:09.890
<v Speaker 2>There's four different speakers and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>detects if you're holding it.</v>

1935
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:11.870
<v Speaker 2>So like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're holding it on the left side it</v>

1936
01:26:11.871 --> 01:26:14.520
<v Speaker 2>will make a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom left louder,</v>

1937
01:26:14.521 --> 01:26:15.740
<v Speaker 2>you know to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:50.900
<v Speaker 2>having your own playlist before you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>on?</v>

1956
01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:55.900
<v Speaker 2>I guess for the theater when people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to infringe on the creative</v>

1957
01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:59.330
<v Speaker 2>rights of the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's the sound guy in that situation</v>

1958
01:26:59.331 --> 01:27:01.130
<v Speaker 2>you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now you've got someone picking a C</v>

1959
01:27:01.131 --> 01:27:03.320
<v Speaker 2>and c music factory to warm up your</v>
<v Speaker 2>crowd like that.</v>

1960
01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally making that part up but it</v>
<v Speaker 2>can happen.</v>

1961
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:08.000
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Where the fuck did you get CNC music</v>

1963
01:27:12.861 --> 01:27:17.660
<v Speaker 2>factors and that's a randomly allocating</v>
<v Speaker 2>something really shitty from a long time</v>

1964
01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:19.520
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean you could have like a nice little</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just even like if you just put it</v>

1967
01:27:25.401 --> 01:27:28.910
<v Speaker 2>in your warmup or your workout playlist</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just have those like rock songs with</v>

1968
01:27:28.911 --> 01:27:31.220
<v Speaker 2>a couple of a hip hop songs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that'd be good to play for 30</v>

1969
01:27:31.221 --> 01:27:36.221
<v Speaker 2>minutes while someone's warming up</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of a anything random love shack</v>

<v Speaker 2>One of them is woody Allen doing stand</v>

2090
01:32:59.841 --> 01:33:02.290
<v Speaker 2>up in like the 1960s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

2091
01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:04.330
<v Speaker 2>He's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a very good stand up man.</v>

2092
01:33:04.570 --> 01:33:06.100
<v Speaker 2>He was a good comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why shaking your head?</v>

2093
01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:06.920
<v Speaker 2>I just hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2094
01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:08.500
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a whiner to me.</v>

2095
01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:11.440
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that windy back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't that one you back then.</v>

2096
01:33:11.441 --> 01:33:12.040
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2097
01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:13.930
<v Speaker 2>it was a different style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>

2098
01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:15.340
<v Speaker 2>it was different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a different guy.</v>

2099
01:33:15.341 --> 01:33:19.360
<v Speaker 2>He was a young guy and he was known more</v>
<v Speaker 2>of as a comic.</v>

2100
01:33:19.600 --> 01:33:21.040
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2101
01:33:21.190 --> 01:33:26.190
<v Speaker 2>an interview where it's just woody allen</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about the process of creating</v>

2102
01:33:26.471 --> 01:33:29.640
<v Speaker 2>comedy and what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of after he hits stuff.</v>

2103
01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:30.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it right there.</v>

2104
01:33:30.401 --> 01:33:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Those are the two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woody Allen on comedy and then Woody</v>

2105
01:33:33.860 --> 01:33:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Allen standup comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the two that I was listening</v>

2106
01:33:36.581 --> 01:33:38.410
<v Speaker 2>to back to back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>

2107
01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:40.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2108
01:33:40.690 --> 01:33:43.240
<v Speaker 2>certainly not sympathetic to like what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's done.</v>

2109
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:45.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's such a fucking Weirdo and what he's</v>

2110
01:33:45.041 --> 01:33:46.960
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just this,</v>

2111
01:33:46.961 --> 01:33:50.230
<v Speaker 2>the fact that that girl was his daughter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I guess it's so creepy to me write</v>

2112
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:55.470
<v Speaker 2>to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but looking past that and just trying</v>

2113
01:33:55.631 --> 01:33:56.350
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2114
01:33:56.350 --> 01:33:58.700
<v Speaker 2>examine him as a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a,</v>

2115
01:33:58.701 --> 01:34:01.060
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a complex and weird human being he is.</v>

2116
01:34:01.061 --> 01:34:02.470
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's pretty fascinating.</v>

2117
01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:04.840
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think he's victimizing</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody else,</v>

2118
01:34:04.841 --> 01:34:05.800
<v Speaker 2>at least as far as I know.</v>

2119
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:08.080
<v Speaker 2>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any judgment.</v>

2120
01:34:08.110 --> 01:34:08.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2121
01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:10.510
<v Speaker 2>He's not in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so no one's,</v>

2122
01:34:10.570 --> 01:34:12.750
<v Speaker 2>no one's going after him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whatever.</v>

2123
01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:13.301
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2124
01:34:13.301 --> 01:34:16.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just watching his life.</v>

2125
01:34:16.151 --> 01:34:19.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm just looking at his life and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a fascinating character,</v>

2126
01:34:19.361 --> 01:34:20.650
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2127
01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:24.040
<v Speaker 2>he is a jazz musician and for awhile he</v>
<v Speaker 2>did,</v>

2128
01:34:24.041 --> 01:34:28.750
<v Speaker 2>he did a documentary before everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>got real ugly right where he was going</v>

2129
01:34:28.751 --> 01:34:31.180
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it before everything got real ugly</v>

2130
01:34:31.181 --> 01:34:35.710
<v Speaker 2>or was it in the middle of it all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he went around playing jazz</v>

2131
01:34:35.711 --> 01:34:37.870
<v Speaker 2>concerts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that was always like sort of like</v>

2132
01:34:37.871 --> 01:34:40.300
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dream that he had.</v>

2133
01:34:40.330 --> 01:34:43.660
<v Speaker 2>So he went around and doing a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>jazz concerts and um,</v>

2134
01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:46.270

<v Speaker 2>Wild Man Blues.</v>

2136
01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:53.560
<v Speaker 2>1997 wonder who named it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was ironic,</v>

2137
01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:57.920
<v Speaker 2>ironic calling him the wild wild man</v>
<v Speaker 2>blues or is building a wild man.</v>

2138
01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:01.440
<v Speaker 2>I wonder when was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if some of it's,</v>

2139
01:35:01.450 --> 01:35:02.930
<v Speaker 2>that's 97.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did,</v>

2140
01:35:02.931 --> 01:35:04.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this controversy take place?</v>

2141
01:35:04.890 --> 01:35:06.050

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2142
01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:07.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so because that's 20 years</v>

2143
01:35:07.971 --> 01:35:10.460
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 20 years ago that that girl was like</v>

2144
01:35:10.461 --> 01:35:12.560
<v Speaker 2>10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2145
01:35:13.010 --> 01:35:15.320

<v Speaker 2>We forget about it.</v>

2148
01:35:22.641 --> 01:35:25.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>woody Allen seems to have fallen in love</v>

01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:02.230
<v Speaker 9>Nope.</v>

2184
01:37:02.230 --> 01:37:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>published 2015 oh,</v>

2185
01:37:04.081 --> 01:37:08.420
<v Speaker 2>why just say 92 now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fling started in 1992 oh,</v>

2186
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:09.950
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

2187
01:37:09.951 --> 01:37:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Cause how the fuck was she?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2188
01:37:11.751 --> 01:37:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm retarded because in 1992 that</v>

2189
01:37:15.351 --> 01:37:16.580
<v Speaker 2>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2190
01:37:16.581 --> 01:37:17.990
<v Speaker 2>That's so weird though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

2191
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:21.860
<v Speaker 2>So he talks about it now and they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been married forever.</v>

2192
01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:26.720
<v Speaker 2>See that's what's fucked up about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's fucked up about it is it worked.</v>

2193
01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:31.040
<v Speaker 2>They've been together for 23 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have children.</v>

2194
01:37:31.041 --> 01:37:33.200
<v Speaker 2>Look at that photo of him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's scroll down and look at their</v>

2195
01:37:33.201 --> 01:37:34.250
<v Speaker 2>photo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're smiling there,</v>

2196
01:37:34.251 --> 01:37:35.380
<v Speaker 2>arm in arm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they leave,</v>

2197
01:37:35.410 --> 01:37:37.580
<v Speaker 2>they're happy together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked up,</v>

2198
01:37:37.581 --> 01:37:39.830
<v Speaker 2>but it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I get a certain point in time.</v>

2199
01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:41.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

2200
01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:44.030
<v Speaker 2>they're not genetically related,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is always the big concern.</v>

2201
01:37:44.031 --> 01:37:46.280
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big concern was that your genes</v>

2202
01:37:46.281 --> 01:37:49.040
<v Speaker 2>would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had sex with someone who's your</v>

2203
01:37:49.041 --> 01:37:52.100
<v Speaker 2>actual daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your genes be all fucked up and you'd</v>

2204
01:37:52.101 --> 01:37:52.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2205
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:54.690
<v Speaker 2>she's kissing him on the cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She seems to love them.</v>

2206
01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:57.300
<v Speaker 2>Shovel head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

2207
01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:58.261
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2208
01:37:58.261 --> 01:38:01.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have these ideas of what's,</v>

2209
01:38:01.771 --> 01:38:03.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's okay and not okay and it's</v>

2210
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:07.020
<v Speaker 2>certainly seems fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if she was 21 when it happened,</v>

2211
01:38:07.230 --> 01:38:09.210
<v Speaker 2>she was a grown woman and she decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

2212
01:38:10.110 --> 01:38:13.020
<v Speaker 2>I want to fuck my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my sort of dad,</v>

2213
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:16.770
<v Speaker 2>the guy who lives across the lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the city,</v>

2214
01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:17.290
<v Speaker 2>they live in like</v>

2215
01:38:17.290 --> 01:38:19.480
<v Speaker 5>opposite sides of the parking or so in</v>
<v Speaker 5>this picture,</v>

2216
01:38:19.510 --> 01:38:19.961
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2217
01:38:19.961 --> 01:38:22.690
<v Speaker 5>I could see what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was probably fucking her though at</v>

2218
01:38:22.691 --> 01:38:24.940
<v Speaker 5>this age.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what the problem is as it's</v>

2219
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:26.410
<v Speaker 5>parental,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2220
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:29.500
<v Speaker 5>he should not be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he might have like raised her to want</v>

2221
01:38:29.501 --> 01:38:31.120
<v Speaker 5>that Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh.</v>

2222
01:38:31.570 --> 01:38:36.520
<v Speaker 5>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you can adopt a girl at 17 maybe find</v>

2223
01:38:36.521 --> 01:38:37.900
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's not bad.</v>

2224
01:38:37.901 --> 01:38:39.970
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause it's like if you were like a</v>

2225
01:38:39.971 --> 01:38:41.890
<v Speaker 5>parent to a kid for like six months.</v>

2226
01:38:42.410 --> 01:38:44.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm well I'm sure that's been done.</v>

2227
01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't it like a Ted nugent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2228
01:38:47.350 --> 01:38:49.310
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it jokingly hinted out for a long time</v>

2229
01:38:49.311 --> 01:38:51.020
<v Speaker 2>before they actually came out and said</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2230
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:51.890
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know actually,</v>

2231
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Ted nugent did that.</v>

2232
01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Ted nugent adopted a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like Google that there was like some</v>

2233
01:38:59.451 --> 01:39:00.560
<v Speaker 2>crazy controversy</v>

2234
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:04.800
<v Speaker 5>cause I mean that might not be a bad</v>
<v Speaker 5>deal checking out some of these like</v>

2235
01:39:04.830 --> 01:39:07.710
<v Speaker 5>orphanage websites and just finding the</v>
<v Speaker 5>17 year old ones.</v>

2236
01:39:08.690 --> 01:39:09.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun to it.</v>

2237
01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:11.120
<v Speaker 2>See if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2238
01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:12.450
<v Speaker 2>but good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just Google that,</v>

2239
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:13.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2240
01:39:13.411 --> 01:39:18.411
<v Speaker 2>well he wrote songs about like having</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex with young young ladies that were</v>

2241
01:39:18.721 --> 01:39:21.090
<v Speaker 2>very young under age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted nugent pick,</v>

2242
01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:22.610
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2243
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Legal Guardian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He became her legal guardian.</v>

2244
01:39:25.861 --> 01:39:27.030
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't adopt her.</v>

2245
01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:30.780
<v Speaker 2>She was 17 that's exactly head of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2246
01:39:30.870 --> 01:39:32.400
<v Speaker 2>But back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2247
01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.680
<v Speaker 2>What year was this when this happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

2248
01:39:34.710 --> 01:39:36.630
<v Speaker 2>get rid of these photos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gross me out.</v>

2249
01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what year was that?</v>

2250
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:44.000
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] 78 78</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much different with things back then</v>

2251
01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:47.400
<v Speaker 2>do you take that into consideration?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to almost all the time.</v>

2252
01:39:47.401 --> 01:39:52.290
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to consider the con.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the context of what's going</v>

2253
01:39:52.291 --> 01:39:52.710
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2254
01:39:52.710 --> 01:39:54.840
<v Speaker 2>What was the context in the culture at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the time?</v>

2255
01:39:55.170 --> 01:39:57.330
<v Speaker 2>Because we were talking about that with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the socrates.</v>

2256
01:39:57.900 --> 01:39:59.420
<v Speaker 2>Socrates was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2257
01:39:59.490 --> 01:40:02.970
<v Speaker 2>they were all pederasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all liked to bang young boys.</v>

2258
01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:05.040
<v Speaker 2>It was real common back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2259
01:40:05.041 --> 01:40:09.480
<v Speaker 2>but yet no one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one has a little asterisk next to</v>

2260
01:40:09.481 --> 01:40:11.610
<v Speaker 2>everything soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said you don't say,</v>

2261
01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:14.310
<v Speaker 2>but remember he used to bang little</v>
<v Speaker 2>boys,</v>

2262
01:40:14.730 --> 01:40:17.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if that was today you would,</v>

2263
01:40:17.790 --> 01:40:20.850
<v Speaker 2>so as far as like woody Allen did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's creepy,</v>

2264
01:40:21.630 --> 01:40:22.710
<v Speaker 2>but is it bad?</v>

2265
01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:27.720
<v Speaker 5>It just depends when it started and if</v>
<v Speaker 5>it started when she was 12 or something</v>

2266
01:40:27.721 --> 01:40:29.910
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then he could have like totally fucking,</v>

2267
01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:31.920
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brainwashed her to the point where now</v>

2268
01:40:31.921 --> 01:40:33.690
<v Speaker 5>she just thinks she has to be with him</v>

2269
01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:36.530
<v Speaker 2>and there was a mia frowns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other daughter was saying that he did</v>

2270
01:40:36.531 --> 01:40:40.160
<v Speaker 2>something to her too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Woody Allen was saying that.</v>

2271
01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:41.690
<v Speaker 2>What do be US magazine?</v>

<v Speaker 2>about it all day.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He would pay that much money for a</v>

2277
01:40:55.841 --> 01:40:57.460
<v Speaker 2>baseball game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basketball.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He did a really good job marketing</v>
<v Speaker 4>himself in Asia.</v>

2288
01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.380
<v Speaker 4>Did he,</v>

2290
01:41:23.541 --> 01:41:25.370
<v Speaker 4>the off season.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would go play and do like a</v>

2291
01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:29.510
<v Speaker 4>exhibitions and whatnot and they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it to get the Asian market into</v>

<v Speaker 2>what happened to Lynn Sanity?</v>

2299
01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I'm on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't hear about that dude anymore.</v>

2300
01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.470
<v Speaker 2>He's in Charlotte right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I'm,</v>

2301
01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:55.940
<v Speaker 2>but what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he doing well?</v>

2302
01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:57.020
<v Speaker 2>He's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just an average,</v>

2303
01:41:57.021 --> 01:42:00.110
<v Speaker 2>really good point guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck happened during that one</v>

2304
01:42:00.111 --> 01:42:02.270
<v Speaker 2>time where he's just New York and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>was he doing?</v>

2305
01:42:02.271 --> 01:42:03.740
<v Speaker 2>He's just kept hitting three pointers or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2306
01:42:03.741 --> 01:42:04.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm really good street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2307
01:42:04.590 --> 01:42:08.210
<v Speaker 4>Give like 10 games where he played</v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely well and they needed some</v>

2308
01:42:08.211 --> 01:42:11.520
<v Speaker 4>hyped of weight and he was playing into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hike and it worked out</v>

2309
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:14.060
<v Speaker 2>and now it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that it's over,</v>

2310
01:42:14.061 --> 01:42:15.410
<v Speaker 2>it's just there's other things to talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

2311
01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how come like me on the outside,</v>

2312
01:42:17.930 --> 01:42:21.620
<v Speaker 2>I find out about athletes when they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>in trouble or they do something crazy.</v>

2313
01:42:21.950 --> 01:42:23.510
<v Speaker 2>They have to do something like really</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

2314
01:42:24.050 --> 01:42:25.730
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the only time I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I remember thinking,</v>

2315
01:42:25.731 --> 01:42:27.410
<v Speaker 2>well this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking,</v>

2316
01:42:27.411 --> 01:42:30.560
<v Speaker 2>well look in there finally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know the Asian people have some</v>

2317
01:42:30.561 --> 01:42:33.710
<v Speaker 2>super fucking bad ass basketball player</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than the giant guy.</v>

2318
01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:36.140
<v Speaker 2>This is what he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like doing the crazy hairstyles</v>

2319
01:42:36.570 --> 01:42:38.960
<v Speaker 2>like dragon ball z out his hair this</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

2320
01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Crazy spiky hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2321
01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:40.711
<v Speaker 4>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I said,</v>

2322
01:42:40.711 --> 01:42:42.540
<v Speaker 4>he's playing in Charlotte,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a smaller market.</v>

2323
01:42:42.541 --> 01:42:43.980
<v Speaker 4>So there's lot of people talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2324
01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:46.860
<v Speaker 4>When he was playing in La,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you did a couple of years ago</v>

2325
01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:49.560
<v Speaker 4>after the whole thing happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was a part of getting the Asian</v>

2326
01:42:49.561 --> 01:42:53.010
<v Speaker 4>market into play in the NBA and like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lakers and there's a lot of Asian people</v>

2327
01:42:53.011 --> 01:42:55.800
<v Speaker 4>in la that they could get money off of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he was in New York,</v>

2328
01:42:55.801 --> 01:42:57.390
<v Speaker 4>he went to La,</v>
<v Speaker 4>played in Houston for a little while,</v>

2329
01:42:57.391 --> 01:42:59.280
<v Speaker 4>but now he's stuck in Charlotte,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is why you don't hear about them.</v>

2330
01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well also he hasn't been set in the</v>

2331
01:43:03.081 --> 01:43:03.800
<v Speaker 2>world on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2332
01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:05.570
<v Speaker 2>And they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not one of the top teams,</v>

2333
01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:07.340
<v Speaker 2>but they play against the top teams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2334
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if he was like super awesome,</v>

2335
01:43:10.190 --> 01:43:11.210
<v Speaker 2>you would hear about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2336
01:43:11.211 --> 01:43:13.730
<v Speaker 2>And you still do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you tuned into sports center and see</v>

2337
01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:16.220
<v Speaker 2>the top 10 or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would hear about his name here and</v>

2338
01:43:16.221 --> 01:43:17.054
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2339
01:43:17.110 --> 01:43:21.140
<v Speaker 2>He's just kind of like four k four k.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

2340
01:43:22.610 --> 01:43:24.350
<v Speaker 2>He's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was that fun.</v>

2341
01:43:24.550 --> 01:43:26.890
<v Speaker 2>And that was a hinchcliffe I okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's Vietnamese.</v>

2343
01:43:30.831 --> 01:43:32.540
<v Speaker 2>He's not Vietnamese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was racist.</v>

2344
01:43:32.541 --> 01:43:34.310
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's pho.</v>

2345
01:43:34.311 --> 01:43:35.850
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you say Fafa.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know you were over here using all</v>

2353
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:53.230
<v Speaker 5>far.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2354
01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:58.300

<v Speaker 5>restaurants always use it as it's like</v>

2355
01:43:58.341 --> 01:44:00.890

<v Speaker 5>Like cause I know that we're stupid and</v>

2356
01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:03.200
<v Speaker 5>we don't bother researching what the</v>
<v Speaker 5>actual word.</v>

2357
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:05.510
<v Speaker 5>It's like how many people called the</v>
<v Speaker 5>hoists?</v>

2358
01:44:05.511 --> 01:44:09.530
<v Speaker 5>Gracie Royce Gracie?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because they were unaware that you have</v>

2359
01:44:09.531 --> 01:44:12.350
<v Speaker 5>to pronounce the r like an h when he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>speaking Portuguese.</v>

<v Speaker 2>names,</v>

2365

01:44:35.210 --> 01:44:36.830
<v Speaker 4>I was trying to ask you yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

2368
01:44:36.831 --> 01:44:38.780
<v Speaker 4>about this facebook camera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you thought about it.</v>

2369
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:43.610
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's 17 cameras put together in one to</v>

2370
01:44:43.611 --> 01:44:45.170
<v Speaker 4>make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's called the facebook camera.</v>

2371
01:44:45.171 --> 01:44:45.951
<v Speaker 4>They announced it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>

2372
01:44:45.951 --> 01:44:47.390
<v Speaker 4>they're not selling it or anything like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2373
01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:50.150
<v Speaker 4>It's going to cost 30,000 bucks to put</v>
<v Speaker 4>it all together,</v>

2374
01:44:50.630 --> 01:44:53.630
<v Speaker 4>but supposedly it's going to make</v>
<v Speaker 4>seamless three 60 video.</v>

2375
01:44:54.020 --> 01:44:54.990
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2376
01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:56.390
<v Speaker 4>so people can watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy that,</v>

2377
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:58.690
<v Speaker 2>how long before that flies around?</v>

2378
01:44:59.060 --> 01:45:00.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you could put it on a drone,</v>

2379
01:45:00.441 --> 01:45:01.020
<v Speaker 4>that'd be pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah</v>

2380
01:45:01.020 --> 01:45:02.670
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that looks like a Ufo.</v>

2381
01:45:03.090 --> 01:45:07.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean this thing that you showing me</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now looks exactly like a classic</v>

2382
01:45:07.711 --> 01:45:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Ufo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>

2383
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.880
<v Speaker 2>Like if they could figure out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a way to make that like put some sort of</v>

2384
01:45:14.881 --> 01:45:19.580
<v Speaker 2>a inside fan makes that thing hover and</v>
<v Speaker 2>move around.</v>

2385
01:45:20.150 --> 01:45:20.510
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2386
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:22.110
<v Speaker 5>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll looks like a Ufo.</v>

2387
01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:24.660
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they sell one that's like that one that</v>

2388
01:45:24.661 --> 01:45:26.670
<v Speaker 5>they sell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kind of like at best buy or Amazon</v>

2389
01:45:26.671 --> 01:45:28.410
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's the same idea where it just</v>

2390
01:45:28.411 --> 01:45:31.710
<v Speaker 5>records it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like write it records like a three 60</v>

2391
01:45:31.711 --> 01:45:32.940
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you can't really do anything with</v>

2392
01:45:32.941 --> 01:45:35.010
<v Speaker 5>the video other than the vr.</v>

2393
01:45:35.050 --> 01:45:36.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of trouble right now going</v>

2394
01:45:36.941 --> 01:45:38.650
<v Speaker 4>into a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we brought this up the other day,</v>

2395
01:45:38.651 --> 01:45:39.670
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people were asking us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2396
01:45:39.671 --> 01:45:41.050
<v Speaker 4>you guys should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be totally awesome,</v>

2397
01:45:41.051 --> 01:45:44.110
<v Speaker 4>which it would be cool for us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of hurdles to get to.</v>

2398
01:45:44.150 --> 01:45:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had a real good point too.</v>

2399
01:45:45.411 --> 01:45:46.880
<v Speaker 2>We said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember when people are going,</v>

2400
01:45:46.881 --> 01:45:48.740
<v Speaker 2>how come everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it on three D tv?</v>

2401
01:45:49.010 --> 01:45:52.040
<v Speaker 2>What about three d TV while you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>your show on three d tv now try to find</v>

2402
01:45:52.041 --> 01:45:53.600
<v Speaker 2>a three D tv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has one.</v>

2403
01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:56.550
<v Speaker 4>The Three d broadcasting was still</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably only did twice.</v>

2404
01:45:56.670 --> 01:45:57.660
<v Speaker 2>It's not ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2405
01:45:57.810 --> 01:46:00.960
<v Speaker 2>none of that stuff's ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's going to be like oculus</v>

2406
01:46:00.961 --> 01:46:03.270
<v Speaker 2>rift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it wasn't ready until it's ready.</v>

2407
01:46:03.570 --> 01:46:05.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for the longest time when we were</v>

2408
01:46:05.101 --> 01:46:07.530
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual reality was a thing like there</v>

2409
01:46:07.531 --> 01:46:09.720
<v Speaker 2>was even a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where was it?</v>

2410
01:46:09.721 --> 01:46:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Lawnmower man.</v>
