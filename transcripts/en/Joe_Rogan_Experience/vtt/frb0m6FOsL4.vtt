00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.470
<v Speaker 2>but in fact your original question of why am I thinking about simplifying and</v>

3
00:00:06.471 --> 00:00:07.340
<v Speaker 2>all those kinds of stuff.</v>

4
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.960
<v Speaker 2>I am a pretty light positive person.</v>

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Very optimistic,</v>

6
00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:13.311
<v Speaker 2>very.</v>

7
00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:15.350
<v Speaker 2>I kind of live in that world,</v>

8
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.630
<v Speaker 2>but when I just started reading the book,</v>

9
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.100
<v Speaker 2>are things really pissing me off?</v>

10
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.210
<v Speaker 2>Am I stressed?</v>

11
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.480
<v Speaker 2>Do I have anxiety because I live in this house because I'm trying to do these</v>

12
00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:27.380
<v Speaker 2>things with my career because I'm trying to always do this because I'm carrying</v>

13
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.500
<v Speaker 2>children and parents and all of this stuff.</v>

14
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to make everybody happy.</v>

15
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

16
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

17
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.830
<v Speaker 2>maybe just realizing that and thinking about it.</v>

18
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm didn't.</v>

19
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.080
<v Speaker 2>No heavy meditation on it.</v>

20
00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:39.410
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

21
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Just being aware that maybe that's where it's coming from.</v>

22
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you over a month and a half the pain slowly went away and I don't</v>

23
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:49.334
<v Speaker 2>have it.</v>

24
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.030
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

25
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

26
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:51.740
<v Speaker 2>That is interesting.</v>

27
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>

28
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>like what was bothering you before?</v>

29
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Like I know that you're,</v>

30
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>you're successful and you had a television show for awhile and you've got a</v>

32
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>bunch of projects going on.</v>

33
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>You're always doing standup and specials,</v>

34
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.230
<v Speaker 1>so you have had a lot of success.</v>

35
00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>You've got a lot of great stuff going on.</v>

36
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.020
<v Speaker 1>What was,</v>

37
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>what was kind of chew and at you?</v>

38
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

39
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really 100 percent sure of what the sources,</v>

40
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.750
<v Speaker 2>but I do feel like I have a lot of people on my back and it's all,</v>

41
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.490
<v Speaker 2>it's all quiet.</v>

42
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.570
<v Speaker 2>It's all in my head,</v>

43
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.590
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

44
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.700
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people on your back.</v>

45
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

46
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.500
<v Speaker 2>I've got a wife.</v>

47
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.310
<v Speaker 2>I've got,</v>

48
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I've got kids,</v>

49
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.680
<v Speaker 2>I've got pets,</v>

50
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.240
<v Speaker 2>I've got family.</v>

51
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.240
<v Speaker 2>I've got</v>

52
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>in the end that you feel that there's a weird,</v>

53
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:39.400
<v Speaker 1>a weird way to um,</v>

54
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 1>bring,</v>

55
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.981
<v Speaker 1>bring this up.</v>

56
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>But there's that.</v>

57
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>How much of that like having a wife and having kids,</v>

58
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>obviously there's going to be compromises and there's going to be stressed that</v>

59
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 1>comes along with any sort of relationship.</v>

60
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.180
<v Speaker 1>But do you feel like it was tipping more towards the negative than towards the</v>

61
00:01:57.181 --> 00:01:58.014
<v Speaker 1>positive?</v>

62
00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.733
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

63
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was.</v>

64
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.520
<v Speaker 2>I think I just,</v>

65
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:03.354
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

66
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 2>the whole experience to me seems positive.</v>

67
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 2>My relationship with my wife is great.</v>

68
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.630
<v Speaker 2>The kids I adore,</v>

69
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.950
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's all positive,</v>

70
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.960
<v Speaker 2>but I do carry the burden of everybody's worries and everybody's wellbeing all</v>

71
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:19.171
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

72
00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:20.170
<v Speaker 2>I was working on this act,</v>

73
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 2>this joke in my act before I started thinking about all this stuff I had this</v>

74
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 2>moment where I'm standing in this house,</v>

75
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 2>I moved to this bigger house.</v>

76
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:28.850
<v Speaker 2>It's a really nice house to bigger,</v>

77
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 2>bigger home and I was shutting off all the lights is what I was working through</v>

78
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 2>onstage and I was turning off all the lights one night and locking the doors for</v>

79
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:39.270
<v Speaker 2>all the bad people that are coming to get us.</v>

80
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 2>And everyone's in their beds and the cat's asleep and the dog's asleep and</v>

81
00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 2>everybody the Lizard Asleep.</v>

82
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.623
<v Speaker 2>And it just,</v>

83
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 2>all my responsibility washed over me.</v>

84
00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody,</v>

85
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.310
<v Speaker 2>every living thing here is,</v>

86
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

87
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

88
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 2>depending on my success.</v>

89
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.740
<v Speaker 2>If I don't keep going,</v>

90
00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 2>if I don't keep succeeding this,</v>

91
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 2>everything here changes everybody's little life.</v>

92
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:04.774
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's perfect,</v>

93
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 2>perfect little existence.</v>

94
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 2>It's all washing over me and I can't tell anyone about it.</v>

95
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you the audience,</v>

96
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 2>but I can't go sit on my daughter's bed at two in the morning when I have that</v>

97
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:15.454
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>

98
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.403
<v Speaker 2>Honey,</v>

99
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.353
<v Speaker 2>do you ever.</v>

100
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever feel like he just can't do it anymore?</v>

101
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 2>You ever feel like you can't.</v>

102
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 2>He just want to stop.</v>

103
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 2>He just wanted to take a break.</v>

104
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 2>This whole thing about waking up my daughter with my fears.</v>

105
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

106
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't tell my wife that stuff.</v>

107
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:31.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't tell my kids that stuff.</v>

108
00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 2>I just carry it.</v>

109
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 2>So when I started reading this book I'm like,</v>

110
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm just taking this really seriously and feeling like,</v>

111
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.993
<v Speaker 2>hm.</v>

112
00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

113
00:03:41.321 --> 00:03:42.790
<v Speaker 3>I used to have to deal with a lot more.</v>

114
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 3>I used to choose to deal with it a lot more and now it's just like I'm 46.</v>

115
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

116
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you like there was a person who came to one of the screenings on the</v>

117
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:51.401
<v Speaker 3>road.</v>

118
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:52.690
<v Speaker 3>We had the screening at.</v>

119
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

120
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.681
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

121
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 3>I forgot where we were.</v>

122
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 3>I want to say New Orleans and of Yoga hosers I was doing q and a afterwards and</v>

123
00:03:59.231 --> 00:03:59.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

124
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 3>everyone's getting up and like,</v>

125
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:00.510
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

126
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking stupid.</v>

127
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:06.180
<v Speaker 3>And asking questions and then one guy gets up and he is like tight dude.</v>

128
00:04:06.181 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 3>He's very serious and he's just like,</v>

129
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

130
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.311
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

131
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:12.660
<v Speaker 3>You told the big long story before that movie began and I did.</v>

132
00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:13.950
<v Speaker 3>It was a big intro for the movement.</v>

133
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Began told like an hour long story of how we got there.</v>

134
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:17.471
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

135
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 3>that story did not match the movie I just watched.</v>

136
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.101
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

137
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

138
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.271
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

139
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:23.260
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>

140
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.011
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

141
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:25.810
<v Speaker 3>why did you make that movie?</v>

142
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.681
<v Speaker 3>He's gone.</v>

143
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 3>I found that unwatchable as and everyone in the audience has gone.</v>

144
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.521
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

145
00:04:30.521 --> 00:04:30.881
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

146
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:31.714
<v Speaker 3>no many,</v>

147
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 3>he paid like he overpaid to see this movie if I'm sitting here talking.</v>

148
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

149
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:37.710
<v Speaker 3>let him say what he want,</v>

150
00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 3>like I'm a big boy and fine.</v>

151
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.031
<v Speaker 3>And so he goes,</v>

152
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think you ever should have made it.</v>

153
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:42.484
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>

154
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.031
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

155
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:43.211
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

156
00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 3>you understand that subjective,</v>

157
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:44.741
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

158
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 3>Like you're surrounded by a bunch of people that feel like the opposite way.</v>

159
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.970
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

160
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.331
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

161
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

162
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 3>when people were applauding and shit and then uh,</v>

163
00:04:51.911 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 3>some guy behind him in line jumps in front of the mic and goes,</v>

164
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 3>you want me to kick his ass?</v>

165
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:56.164
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

166
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.981
<v Speaker 3>fuck no.</v>

167
00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:57.640
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

168
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 3>everyone's entitled to their opinion.</v>

169
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.041
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

170
00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:02.830
<v Speaker 3>but his opinion is I never should have done this.</v>

171
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

172
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 3>my answer to that is like,</v>

173
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.990
<v Speaker 3>that's ridiculous.</v>

174
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:06.240
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>

175
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 3>if I wanted to make it,</v>

176
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.670
<v Speaker 3>like that's the only reason we're here,</v>

177
00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:10.504
<v Speaker 3>I just want to see it.</v>

178
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 3>Like you can choose not to see it.</v>

179
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:13.510
<v Speaker 3>And in this instance,</v>

180
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm really sorry that like you didn't,</v>

181
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 3>artists didn't coincide,</v>

182
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Speaker 3>but every time I go to do one of these things I'd do it the same way.</v>

183
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 3>Whether it was clerks up to the most recent one.</v>

184
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Speaker 3>I just make the movie I want to see.</v>

185
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.090
<v Speaker 3>And hopefully others like it.</v>

186
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.020
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes they do.</v>

187
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 3>And that's amazing and it feels great and you're like,</v>

188
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:27.971
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

189
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:28.804
<v Speaker 3>my fingers on the pulse.</v>

190
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes you're fucking alone.</v>

191
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:31.811
<v Speaker 3>But at least you're like,</v>

192
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm happy with the thing that I made.</v>

193
00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.941
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

194
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:35.650
<v Speaker 3>but I feel heartbroken that you came out of,</v>

195
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:36.910
<v Speaker 3>you're looking for something I didn't give you.</v>

196
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.860
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>

197
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:38.681
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to give you your money back.</v>

198
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 3>And I gave him 40 bucks and I was like,</v>

199
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.540
<v Speaker 3>put it on a riser,</v>

200
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:43.653
<v Speaker 3>a speaker.</v>

201
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.801
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

202
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:45.401
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that.</v>

203
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:45.761
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

204
00:05:45.761 --> 00:05:46.181
<v Speaker 3>no man,</v>

205
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 3>honestly take,</v>

206
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:47.441
<v Speaker 3>it's not a trick.</v>

207
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 3>It's not like Jason Who's going to come out and hit you with a hammer.</v>

208
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:49.931
<v Speaker 3>Just take it like,</v>

209
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:50.471
<v Speaker 3>I feel bad.</v>

210
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:52.740
<v Speaker 3>I want you to have a good time and shit like that.</v>

211
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.961
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

212
00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:53.111
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

213
00:05:53.111 --> 00:05:53.944
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that.</v>

214
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.461
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

215
00:05:54.461 --> 00:05:54.671
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

216
00:05:54.671 --> 00:05:55.930
<v Speaker 3>it makes for an excellent story.</v>

217
00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 3>Like I told him his movie fucking blue to his face and I fucking took his money</v>

218
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 3>and walked out and he goes,</v>

219
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

220
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 3>And he went and sat down and crossed his arms and just stayed there for another,</v>

221
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 3>like half hour during the q and a.</v>

222
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 3>So for him it was worth the $40 bucks just to say it.</v>

223
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to visit a verb,</v>

224
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 3>like just sit here and fucking hate on this and let you know and then sit down</v>

225
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 3>again so you know,</v>

226
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:16.221
<v Speaker 3>you deal with that,</v>

227
00:06:16.221 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 3>but that's the memorable one because that never happens.</v>

228
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 3>Generally speaking,</v>

229
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 3>like when we toured the movie,</v>

230
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.090
<v Speaker 3>you're touring and you're in a safe zone dog.</v>

231
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.930
<v Speaker 3>I hated old edible about a month ago.</v>

232
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 3>I found the back of my draw.</v>

233
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 3>That thing fucked me up</v>

234
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 1>was just like an expired it and you would take an expired viking and you won't</v>

235
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 1>have paid for a week.</v>

236
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.253
<v Speaker 1>Mouth.</v>

237
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how many root canals they give.</v>

238
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:40.630
<v Speaker 1>You expired my pants,</v>

239
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.420
<v Speaker 1>my wife's,</v>

240
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 1>my wife and watch that tell you about that now.</v>

241
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.543
<v Speaker 1>A lot of</v>

242
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>

243
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.090
<v Speaker 1>I pop that motherfucking after it was washing detergent stronger than ever.</v>

244
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Fucking I just found it.</v>

245
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.841
<v Speaker 1>I found it.</v>

246
00:06:56.841 --> 00:07:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't even on the bike and I took one out with me in case I had tooth pain</v>

247
00:07:00.121 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 1>and those pain and I never wore those pants again.</v>

248
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.093
<v Speaker 1>I go to Portland,</v>

249
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 1>I go on the pants and that her,</v>

250
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.750
<v Speaker 1>she watched it right before I went onstage.</v>

251
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I popped up out that motherfucker</v>

252
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 1>who gives a fuck.</v>

253
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to know what it is anymore.</v>

254
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:15.980
<v Speaker 1>I've been through everything.</v>

255
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Pulling a do nothing dog.</v>

256
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.183
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

257
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.363
<v Speaker 1>how strong was it?</v>

258
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.361
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

259
00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:25.050
<v Speaker 1>I took a half on stage and I blacked out like the first 30 minutes.</v>

260
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.120
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't wait to get back to the hotel room.</v>

261
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.213
<v Speaker 1>The other</v>

262
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 1>radio the next day.</v>

263
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

264
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Black the fuck.</v>

265
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.950
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what came out of my mouth.</v>

266
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.410
<v Speaker 1>When you on radio you just start swearing.</v>

267
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:37.970
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

268
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:38.091
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

269
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:38.191
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

270
00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:38.790
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

271
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm headed to Portland Thursday night.</v>

272
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.693
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Portland.</v>

273
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting dressed.</v>

274
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 1>When I was pulling pants,</v>

275
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.460
<v Speaker 1>these pants are darker than my usual jeans.</v>

276
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.533
<v Speaker 1>I never wore.</v>

277
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:49.981
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want.</v>

278
00:07:49.981 --> 00:07:50.814
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

279
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.000
<v Speaker 1>last time I went was probably when I had the surgery and that's when I found the</v>

280
00:07:54.001 --> 00:07:55.530
<v Speaker 1>pill in that they were clean.</v>

281
00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I went into the detergent,</v>

282
00:07:58.561 --> 00:07:59.730
<v Speaker 1>had won the numbers down,</v>

283
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.230
<v Speaker 1>so could have been anything,</v>

284
00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.113
<v Speaker 1>so I just.</v>

285
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:02.441
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

286
00:08:02.441 --> 00:08:03.271
<v Speaker 1>let me not be an answer.</v>

287
00:08:03.271 --> 00:08:04.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll eat the whole thing.</v>

288
00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.150
<v Speaker 1>People give me crazy shit all the time.</v>

289
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Let me break this and maybe somebody gave it to me and I watched over it.</v>

290
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I knew it was like a viking cousin to the village,</v>

291
00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:12.924
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>

292
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.300
<v Speaker 1>They had to be a cousin or a brother in law,</v>

293
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:16.590
<v Speaker 1>something that bike.</v>

294
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:17.971
<v Speaker 1>I popped it.</v>

295
00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I took a half and went to Portland.</v>

296
00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:22.740
<v Speaker 1>I walked up those stairs and when I sat down on top of the thing,</v>

297
00:08:22.741 --> 00:08:23.040
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

298
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:23.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucked up.</v>

299
00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.731
<v Speaker 1>I smoked dogs,</v>

300
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:26.131
<v Speaker 1>but I tell you,</v>

301
00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:29.430
<v Speaker 1>I set the fire alarm off and the club on Friday night,</v>

302
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.300
<v Speaker 1>the fight in the dressing room and the fucking fire department had to come</v>

303
00:08:33.301 --> 00:08:34.680
<v Speaker 1>because the whole club blacks out,</v>

304
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:36.510
<v Speaker 1>all the lights go out and pilot</v>

305
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.590
<v Speaker 1>had to go onstage and fucking Felicia what up?</v>

306
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Where?</v>

307
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.630
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

308
00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 1>do you want me to go up there and check it out?</v>

309
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:44.170
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

310
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:44.820
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

311
00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.980
<v Speaker 1>that's how much of a comedy store she is.</v>

312
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody else has said,</v>

313
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:49.170
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
