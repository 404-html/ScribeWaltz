<v Speaker 1>They roll pretty hard.</v>

15
00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really a heavy smoker man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be honest on the road.</v>

16
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.930
<v Speaker 1>It keeps me occupied from time to time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I'm writing maybe,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

19
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.550
<v Speaker 1>the first time I did that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what it was.</v>

20
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just pulled it like it was a big old</v>

21
00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:49.750
<v Speaker 1>bong rip and they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I need,</v>

24
00:00:51.731 --> 00:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>you instantly know you just did</v>
<v Speaker 1>something you shouldn't have.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck man.</v>

27
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.660
<v Speaker 1>So I sat down and looked at a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

28
00:00:58.661 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I just started getting really cold and</v>
<v Speaker 1>clammy and I was like,</v>

29
00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to Puke.</v>

30
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.480
<v Speaker 1>So I went over and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucked this guy.</v>

31
00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:06.910
<v Speaker 1>So puke right in the sink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

32
00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:07.840
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta go home.</v>

33
00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I feel like dog shit now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm pretty sure I'm dying.</v>

34
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.080
<v Speaker 1>So I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lived in this apartment and I was</v>

35
00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:17.260
<v Speaker 1>like went out the door and turned the</v>
<v Speaker 1>corner to go down the hallway to mind.</v>

36
00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:19.090
<v Speaker 1>And it was full on vertigo like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hall.</v>

37
00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Every time I took a step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hall we got twice as long.</v>

38
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucked up.</v>

39
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.050
<v Speaker 1>My wife was out of the country on work</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time and I was like,</v>

40
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.610
<v Speaker 1>I remember I was sitting down in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hallway just like trying to get my shit</v>

41
00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:31.271
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

42
00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Cause I thought I was having a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart attack.</v>

43
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>It's just like sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember this voice saying,</v>

44
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>get up you stupid junkie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck before somebody comes out here and</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

46
00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:47.350
<v Speaker 1>sitting in the hallway like a dumb ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I managed to like pop out of it and</v>

47
00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:49.900
<v Speaker 1>as soon as I got back to my place and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down in the couch,</v>

48
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.550
<v Speaker 1>everything was fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just so initial and the rush,</v>

49
00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I was just like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like it ain't a bat.</v>

81
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 2>what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if he was your friend and he texted</v>

<v Speaker 2>feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wouldn't be a good time.</v>

118
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 2>If you're Mckenzie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're anybody that someone is saying</v>

119
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:13.640
<v Speaker 2>those things about right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just be,</v>

120
00:05:13.641 --> 00:05:15.980
<v Speaker 2>and just trying to be open mind cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going off</v>

121
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.360
<v Speaker 2>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turn social justice.</v>

122
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking account.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came out.</v>

123
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 2>It's not possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying is if you look at it</v>

124
00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:30.601
<v Speaker 2>from the position of the person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person who's buttholes in question,</v>

125
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.430
<v Speaker 2>that would be an uncomfortable position</v>
<v Speaker 2>to in right.</v>

126
00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 2>Bunch of people talking about what your</v>
<v Speaker 2>butthole smelled like.</v>

127
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.120
<v Speaker 2>We just try to make a living on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just tried to make a living.</v>

128
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Just tried to trick a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what that it's,</v>

129
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 2>it's also Joey Dheas being</v>
<v Speaker 2>complimentary.</v>

130
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be one thing if she was not an</v>

131
00:05:49.271 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 2>attractive female shut like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's obviously very attractive,</v>

132
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 2>which is what makes us funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree 100%.</v>

133
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely people that are bored</v>
<v Speaker 2>with though like enough.</v>

134
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Well they Hollywood's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Hollywood tends to be,</v>

135
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 2>what bothers me about Hollywood is their</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual virtue signaling.</v>

136
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 2>Like they're going to set an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucking guys like you want to be</v>

137
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:09.080
<v Speaker 2>liked.</v>

138
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're as fickle as it gets.</v>

139
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 2>They were the same people that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing up and clapping for Roman</v>

140
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.490
<v Speaker 2>Polanski.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry man.</v>

141
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 2>Well some of them were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them were really saying some</v>

142
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:21.150
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean guys,</v>

143
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 2>it's a long time ago and he's drugged</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sodomized.</v>

144
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:27.470
<v Speaker 2>A 13 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was like more than one too.</v>

145
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So guess what?</v>

146
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 2>I can't have that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not kidding.</v>

147
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.580
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to sign a petition to bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>them back in the country.</v>

148
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 2>I can't forgive that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No stay in France.</v>

149
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Speaker 2>Well they want to bring it back to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country to arrest them and they're</v>

150
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 2>really trying hard to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's people that resist that.</v>

151
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 2>I think he's an amazing artist and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

152
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.130
<v Speaker 2>artists are just be consistent though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you can system.</v>

153
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.360
<v Speaker 2>That's where I draw the line.</v>

154
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.660
<v Speaker 2>You can't drug kids fucking with the HR</v>
<v Speaker 2>Argento who was one of the,</v>

155
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.820
<v Speaker 2>one of the people that came out against</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvey Weinstein,</v>

156
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 2>she had been raped by him apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she had a sexual relationship</v>

157
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:04.580
<v Speaker 2>with for 10 years afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>

158
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 2>people are like Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I actually forgive that because</v>

159
00:07:07.161 --> 00:07:08.450
<v Speaker 2>people go back to the trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

160
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 2>They want to relive it on their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms.</v>

161
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 2>But she signed the petition to for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for Roman Polanski to,</v>

162
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be freed when he was put under arrest</v>

163
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:20.930
<v Speaker 2>and I believe it was Switzerland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now that's not consistent.</v>

164
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

165
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 2>But if that guy is just as bad as yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see the petition online.</v>

166
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:31.361
<v Speaker 2>What was her perspective?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was somebody who thought Roman</v>

167
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Polanski should not be prosecuted for</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that happened a long time ago.</v>

168
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:38.990
<v Speaker 2>She signed that petition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never sign that petition.</v>

169
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.930
<v Speaker 2>So there's a lot of disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have a big problem with that sort</v>

170
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 2>of disconnect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem.</v>

171
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:45.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know this woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know her.</v>

172
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe her.</v>

173
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:49.670
<v Speaker 2>I believe what she says about Harvey</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weinstein.</v>

174
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:51.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

175
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:51.981
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:07:51.981 --> 00:07:53.480
<v Speaker 2>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well she went back to the scene of the</v>

177
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:54.740
<v Speaker 2>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very common,</v>

178
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:59.741
<v Speaker 2>but don't sign a petition and then now</v>
<v Speaker 2>be this leading voice in this whole,</v>

179
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti harassment.</v>

180
00:08:01.591 --> 00:08:03.650
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very inconsistent.</v>

181
00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to pay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to at least answer to that.</v>

182
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Did she comment on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she signed,</v>

183
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 2>there was a mia culpa there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's very inconsistent in it and</v>

184
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:11.780
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of that up.</v>

185
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.470
<v Speaker 1>So No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of my s team members are going</v>

186
00:08:16.471 --> 00:08:20.670
<v Speaker 1>to shoot me in the face for talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this because in the face,</v>

187
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally in the face.</v>

188
00:08:22.771 --> 00:08:27.771
<v Speaker 1>Because one thing that was an ongoing</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing when I was on the u s team,</v>

189
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.340
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was this thing that went on about</v>

190
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:37.230
<v Speaker 1>how long we could go at a tournament</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we talked about this particular</v>

191
00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:41.820
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So during my time on the teams,</v>

192
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:46.850
<v Speaker 1>we actually had a person that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

193
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:51.990
<v Speaker 1>she claimed to have a medical disorder</v>
<v Speaker 1>or she didn't actually claim to have it,</v>

194
00:08:51.991 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 1>but supposedly it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she claimed have a disorder where</v>

195
00:08:56.131 --> 00:09:01.131
<v Speaker 1>she had attachment to items.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This girl that was on my team actually</v>

196
00:09:01.721 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 1>ended up marrying the Eiffel Tower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you serious?</v>

197
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.750

<v Speaker 1>She and she had an attachment to</v>

198
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.740
<v Speaker 1>a loving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she actually filed some claims against,</v>
