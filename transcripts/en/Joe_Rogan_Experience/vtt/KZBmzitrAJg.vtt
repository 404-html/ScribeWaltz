<v Speaker 1>Hello</v>

<v Speaker 2>Freak bitches.</v>

3
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.020
<v Speaker 2>You put that much emphasis on beauty being one of the defining self worth</v>

4
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:08.070
<v Speaker 2>characteristics.</v>

5
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Then when that starts to go,</v>

6
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 2>you're in this mad fucking scramble for as much surgery as possible to restore</v>

7
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 2>this youth rather than appreciating the gifts that each age bring.</v>

8
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 2>Like each age should bring more wisdom and like,</v>

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 2>like the older Abuelita's like the that you see down in the jungle that have</v>

14
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm tuned into my instincts and I can fucking bring magic.</v>

15
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:34.500
<v Speaker 2>I can heal with herbs.</v>

16
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 2>I can do these different things.</v>

17
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 2>That's all well and good,</v>

18

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

26
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.500

27
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 2>but better than naked because it's all compressed like it's not.</v>

28
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you don't see the sloppy aspects of skin and flesh and tissue and</v>

31
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:11.950
<v Speaker 2>brain and the colors of a flower.</v>

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.241
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit of fear of,</v>

61
00:01:58.241 --> 00:01:58.640
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

62
00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.391

<v Speaker 2>mostly in Canada and in America.</v>

67
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Outside magazine.</v>

68
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.530
<v Speaker 2>The date they quashed that story.</v>

69
00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:06.711
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

70
00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:07.850
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be a big feature.</v>

71
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.841
<v Speaker 2>How did that happen?</v>

72
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:10.400
<v Speaker 2>Do you know the mechanism?</v>

73
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

74
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.781
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

75
00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:12.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

76
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 2>the writer was staying at our place and at the time I believe we had,</v>

77
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

78
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.163
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>

79
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

80
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.000
<v Speaker 2>there were people watching us and I had specifically said because his,</v>

81
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.990
<v Speaker 2>his rental vehicles parked across and here he was sitting on the couch and,</v>

82
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.270
<v Speaker 2>we're talking and talking and I looked and it was a truck that repeatedly drove</v>

84
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:31.220
<v Speaker 2>by and stopped and went to the other in the street,</v>

85
00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:31.491
<v Speaker 2>turned around.</v>

86
00:02:31.491 --> 00:02:31.731
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

87
00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

88
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.510
<v Speaker 2>you're being,</v>

89
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.291
<v Speaker 2>you're being watched.</v>

90
00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:33.970
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

91
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:34.730
<v Speaker 2>and he's just like,</v>

92
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

93
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.360
<v Speaker 2>I think at this point he didn't truly appreciate the depths that we were in.</v>

94
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.650
<v Speaker 2>And at this point I don't,</v>

95
00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.760
<v Speaker 2>we weren't even sued yet.</v>

96
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.841
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

97
00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:42.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

98
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.730
<v Speaker 2>sure as shit marina and named him by name the author and uh,</v>

99
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.841
<v Speaker 2>and that was it.</v>

100
00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:49.720
<v Speaker 2>So he wouldn't,</v>

101
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

102
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.260
<v Speaker 2>he tried to get the,</v>

103
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.521
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

104
00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:51.791
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

105
00:02:51.791 --> 00:02:52.700
<v Speaker 2>the article to run,</v>

106
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:54.070
<v Speaker 2>but outside ultimately said like,</v>

107
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.970
<v Speaker 2>we're not interested in being sued now.</v>

108
00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:56.511
<v Speaker 2>It's a different time.</v>

109
00:02:56.511 --> 00:02:57.830
<v Speaker 2>There's anti slap legislation now,</v>

110
00:02:57.831 --> 00:02:59.120
<v Speaker 2>so outside if you're listening,</v>

111
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

112
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 2>well why didn't they just shut their fucking mouth until they published it?</v>

113
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

114
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.431
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

115
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 2>how did they find out what he was looking?</v>

116
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 2>He was asking a current and former employees to see if anyone would speak.</v>

117
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 2>And then obviously there was someone that went to,</v>

118
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

119
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 2>when you live,</v>

120
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 2>when you worked in an oppressive sort of regime,</v>

121
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:17.190
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>

122
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.520
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

123
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 2>you're quick to try to score bonus points.</v>

124
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 2>I assume the former trainer or someone probably said,</v>

125
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:21.761
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

126
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 2>this guy's calling around looking for something.</v>

127
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 2>What are the businesses that guy have?</v>

128
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 2>They're all in house businesses,</v>

129
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:27.191
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

130
00:03:27.191 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 2>he's got,</v>

131
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 2>he owns a lot of property.</v>

132
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 2>He has,</v>

133
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 2>he owes no one any money.</v>

134
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 2>There's no outside,</v>

135
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

136
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 2>financial interest whatsoever.</v>

137
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 2>He is the sole controlling mind cause it seems like God,</v>

138
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 2>like that needs a come to Jesus moment.</v>

139
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 2>We're just realizing it's was like,</v>

140
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>

141
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.233
<v Speaker 2>My life is,</v>

142
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's at the later stages of his life and just live in like this.</v>

143
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:44.261
<v Speaker 2>So when people,</v>

144
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 2>it's all anger and evil and,</v>

145
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 2>well I hate to mention it,</v>

146
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 2>but the couple of years ago,</v>

147
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:48.701
<v Speaker 2>a few years ago,</v>

148
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 2>and this was my greatest ally,</v>

149
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 2>his son actually passed away and this was the guy who actually allowed me into</v>

150
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 2>the park when I,</v>

151
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 2>when unbenounced to me,</v>

152
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 2>I was no longer allowed there.</v>

153
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 2>He let me in and that's when I saw,</v>

154
00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

155
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.150
<v Speaker 2>smooshy in the condition that she was in.</v>

156
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 2>That ultimately inspired me to sort of speak out and not be anonymous.</v>

157
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

158
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.620
<v Speaker 2>he shortly thereafter actually passed away and he was my age.</v>

159
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 2>I think if you became a lawyer and you were arguing all the time,</v>

160
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 2>you'd probably be a nightmare to be around cause you're probably always trying</v>

161
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:14.254
<v Speaker 2>to win.</v>

162
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.673
<v Speaker 2>I'll for sure.</v>

163
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

164
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

165
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>

166
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

167
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.603
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>

168
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Find their way out of technicalities.</v>

169
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 2>You're a shrink too and you're,</v>

170
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

171
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.081
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

172
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:24.370
<v Speaker 2>every conversation you get in,</v>

173
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:26.290
<v Speaker 2>are you psychoanalyzing everybody probably,</v>

174
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

175
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

176
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

177
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 2>That's got to wear out on you other people for Awhile.</v>

178
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Like will you knock it the fuck off?</v>

179
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

180
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Well when I was in college that was the area.</v>

181
00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm never really applied myself at college at all.</v>

182
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 2>But the one thing that I was thinking of,</v>

183
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 2>like if I had a job,</v>

184
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>

185
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 2>What are things that I'm interested in?</v>

186
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:47.830
<v Speaker 2>Psychology did come up because I'd read a lot of like self help books and</v>

187
00:04:47.831 --> 00:04:52.831
<v Speaker 2>psychology books while I was fighting to try to like manage my mind and anxiety</v>

188
00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:53.854
<v Speaker 2>and shit like that.</v>

189
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.481
<v Speaker 2>But then I thought about it.</v>

190
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:56.314
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

191
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 2>you just be dealing with people with problems all the time and you don't,</v>

192
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily want that.</v>

193
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

194
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's a good idea.</v>

195
00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Just make you dick soft.</v>

196
00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 2>That's why.</v>

197
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Is that do it?</v>

198
00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.993
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

200
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:11.530

201
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 2>I always feel like if you tell me your problems,</v>

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.450

206
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.810

<v Speaker 2>with banter between like the piano player and the guy on the mic and he's like,</v>
