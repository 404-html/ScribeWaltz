<v Speaker 1>minutes comedy for five and that was it.</v>

12
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.920

<v Speaker 1>had to get clever.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I had been asked that a lot and I was</v>

18
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:44.034
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So someone more than one.</v>

23
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>I've been asked by several people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>online or in person.</v>

24
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.241
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

26
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Like that was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that you brought that up is probably</v>

27
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>going to be like some blog posts written</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it and a conspiracy will get</v>

28
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.331
<v Speaker 1>formed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

31
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the type of things that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really wacky people that believe in</v>

32
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:23.061
<v Speaker 1>the Illuminati would start to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>say the d five is actually the jumps in</v>

33
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.210
<v Speaker 1>each.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:29.540
<v Speaker 1>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

36
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>So I was just kind of doing it through</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a little bit too.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it had nothing to do with anything.</v>

40
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 1>The number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name Jenny Johnson was just taken.</v>

41
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.330
<v Speaker 1>You sound a little defensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started to believe that maybe I've got</v>

42
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>the full blown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>full blown disease.</v>

43
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Is Hiv even the disease anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is,</v>

44
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>but nobody dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now I feel like now it's like</v>

45
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.330
<v Speaker 1>whooping cough or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids.</v>

46
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the moment when there's</v>

47
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 1>a few moments where I remember like when</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Kinison died,</v>

48
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like things along those lines when you</v>

49
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 1>found out that someone was done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I heard that Magic Johnson had</v>

50
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the car with my girlfriend and</v>

51
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>we were in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were driving.</v>

52
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 1>We were both like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

53
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>It was like beginning of like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking dead when people started to get</v>

54
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:20.590
<v Speaker 1>sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

55
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.320

<v Speaker 1>It is magic.</v>

57
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Johnson of all people Jensen's famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say the one that killed me too is a</v>

58
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:28.074
<v Speaker 1>easy eating.</v>

59
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He died of aids and that was also like,</v>

60
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.420

<v Speaker 1>you didn't see that coming.</v>

61
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Like I guess I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I just assumed maybe it was all</v>

62
00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:40.610
<v Speaker 1>in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was gay guys that are getting,</v>

<v Speaker 1>York.</v>

67

68
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.210

<v Speaker 1>because every,</v>

00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you would see.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was flipping.</v>

118
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was candy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flip it with some 20 year olds.</v>

119
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Get to say that I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

120
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they brag about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

121
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.010
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my old man.</v>

122
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 2>That poor fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a fascinating guy though because he</v>

123
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 2>is fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on one of the worst sitcoms ever</v>

124
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.290
<v Speaker 2>that was successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that fucking two and a half men was</v>

125
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 2>so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

126
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 2>I tried to watch one episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>

127
00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:44.080
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

128
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even make it through like so</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next break for,</v>

129
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not for me,</v>

130
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.330
<v Speaker 2>but it's for somebody obviously giantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful and to even have him fired</v>

131
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 2>and to bring another lead on and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>still works,</v>

132
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't get canceled it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

133
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:03.760
<v Speaker 3>but I thought it worked for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long do they do it with a coach?</v>

134
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.920
<v Speaker 3>A couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It did work for a bit.</v>

135
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 3>Even noticed the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching that,</v>

136
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 3>they're all on Ahcccs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just fucking sitting in front of</v>

137
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 3>the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whacked out of their head.</v>

138
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.430
<v Speaker 3>They're</v>
<v Speaker 3>just waiting for the laugh track to kick</v>

139
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:21.431
<v Speaker 3>in so they can laugh it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The commercial going to be on.</v>

140
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 3>They get excited for commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So commercial coming on soon and I'm</v>

141
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:28.890
<v Speaker 3>sure the commercials were really</v>
<v Speaker 3>appropriate for that shout down.</v>

142
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.030
<v Speaker 3>Well those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy who Charlie Sheen feuded with</v>

143
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

144
00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 3>he's awesome at making those kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitcoms.</v>

145
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.480
<v Speaker 3>He knows that he's done it a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>successful as shit to that guy.</v>

146
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.460
<v Speaker 3>If I was on a sitcom with him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would ask no questions.</v>

147
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 3>He knows exactly what the fuck he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

148
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 3>You had read the script and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

149
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:47.920
<v Speaker 3>This is the funniest thing she'd ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>read.</v>

150
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just tell me what the words are right</v>

151
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:54.850
<v Speaker 3>before I say</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

152
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.140
<v Speaker 3>what are rehearsed this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's perfect.</v>

153
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.033
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

154
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.560
<v Speaker 3>It's totally amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows how to hit that frequency.</v>

155
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.930
<v Speaker 3>There's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a dog whistle.</v>

156
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Is it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it people in Oxy,</v>

157
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 3>do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or do you just think it's like kind of</v>

158
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:09.740
<v Speaker 3>middle America just get home from work</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

159
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:10.574
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

160
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.070
<v Speaker 3>it's on CBS.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely that.</v>

161
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.050
<v Speaker 3>There's definitely the Middle America</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

162
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Speaker 3>It's not offensive and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an easy watch,</v>

163
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've always said like,</v>

164
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck does anybody watch keeping</v>
<v Speaker 3>up with the Kardashians until I watched</v>

165
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:30.641
<v Speaker 3>it and the fucking thing is so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's compelling the air out loud and</v>

166
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 3>just shit talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like allow things.</v>

167
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.510
<v Speaker 3>I punched my dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

168
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.160
<v Speaker 3>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a lot of people,</v>

169
00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:38.870
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a lot of people hate watch</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

170
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they definitely for sure.</v>

171
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.670
<v Speaker 3>I think there's plenty of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sadly enough that like it.</v>

172
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.790
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people actually watch</v>

173
00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 3>it just because they hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

174
00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:50.660
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things is they've</v>

175
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:53.120
<v Speaker 3>become,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much focus on them that</v>

176
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:55.710
<v Speaker 3>they've become a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when,</v>

177
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.930
<v Speaker 3>when the camera's on people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have this theory about television fame</v>

178
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 3>and just any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any form of media and my theory is that</v>

179
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:08.890
<v Speaker 3>it hijacks these ancient reward systems</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are in place for us to follow</v>

180
00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 3>successful people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like say if we were going to tribe</v>

181
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:17.081
<v Speaker 3>together and all the three of us were in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tribe together and Jamie just fucking</v>

182
00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.500
<v Speaker 3>slayed all the intruders and figured out</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to get the food and new world,</v>

183
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.830
<v Speaker 3>the water was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd be like,</v>

184
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:26.080
<v Speaker 3>we've got a foul Jamie.</v>

185
00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to follow him.</v>

186
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.830
<v Speaker 3>And so Jamie would talk in front of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Campfire and we would listen.</v>

187
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of like a natural thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You follow successful behavior.</v>

188
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when a camera's on someone for whatever</v>

189
00:08:40.011 --> 00:08:41.090
<v Speaker 3>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

190
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.140
<v Speaker 3>we think that that person is successful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they talk,</v>

191
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.450
<v Speaker 3>they talk and we see all the money they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

192
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 3>we see the cars they drive and all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>nails and the purses and all the jazz</v>

193
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.891
<v Speaker 3>and we'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

194
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:53.870
<v Speaker 3>they have all the good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to follow them.</v>

195
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.210
<v Speaker 3>And it sort hijacks this thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>

196
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we're designed for media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that television and film and</v>

197
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:05.140
<v Speaker 3>music and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it hijacks this part of,</v>

198
00:09:05.141 --> 00:09:08.010
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of being a human being that is a.</v>

199
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 3>it's just unaccustomed to these sounds</v>
<v Speaker 3>and these images,</v>

200
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.590
<v Speaker 3>like you go to a movie and you see a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know Brad Pitt or whatever.</v>

201
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:21.570
<v Speaker 3>His head is fucking 15 feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every time he talks the music plays is</v>

202
00:09:21.571 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 3>the words are perfect because they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>all labored by a group of writers.</v>

203
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.750
<v Speaker 3>They've worked at it for weeks to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right sequence of words and the</v>

204
00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:35.751
<v Speaker 3>right order and the right way to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they practiced it hijacks you and</v>

205
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:37.530
<v Speaker 3>then you run into them in person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

206
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.070
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are</v>

207
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.080
<v Speaker 3>dumb as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Hell.</v>

208
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.500
<v Speaker 3>There was an interview that he did once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget who the fuck it was,</v>

209
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who he was doing an interview with</v>

210
00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.261
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

211
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:51.540
<v Speaker 3>who's this fucking moron that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

212
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 3>whoever the guy is like Larry King's</v>
<v Speaker 3>interviewing,</v>

213
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.781
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck is this?</v>

214
00:09:54.781 --> 00:09:57.930
<v Speaker 3>It was on TV and then I turned around</v>
<v Speaker 3>the corner and I saw that it was Brad</v>

215
00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:58.171
<v Speaker 3>Pitt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

216
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brad Pitt.</v>

217
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:03.930
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it bad?</v>

218
00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.690
<v Speaker 3>You're boring as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

219
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.520
<v Speaker 3>It was boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

220
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.560
<v Speaker 3>Is it worse that they're boring or is it</v>
<v Speaker 3>worse when they have been famous for so</v>

221
00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:15.180
<v Speaker 3>long that they have the answers to</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything?</v>

222
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:20.310
<v Speaker 3>I think he's probably so tired from</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Angelina Jolie all the time that</v>

223
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:24.030
<v Speaker 3>he just has no energy for thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all those kids was kids running</v>

224
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:27.270
<v Speaker 3>around screaming and before her it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jennifer Aniston.</v>

225
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.590
<v Speaker 3>Probably reading scripts are there all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time till 3:00 in the morning just</v>

226
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.980
<v Speaker 3>in brush brushing each other's hair and.</v>

227
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 3>But he doesn't have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

228
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:38.070
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like he's like a lottery</v>
<v Speaker 3>winner.</v>

229
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:40.920
<v Speaker 3>He's got great features.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a movie star from the time he was</v>

230
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:43.440
<v Speaker 3>very young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No need to develop a personality</v>

231
00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:45.010
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're pretty,</v>

232
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.440
<v Speaker 3>it works for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've looked at it again,</v>

233
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:48.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's my thing on Angelina Jolie and</v>

234
00:10:48.751 --> 00:10:53.220
<v Speaker 3>Brad Pitt who out of all the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the really famous movie star type</v>

235
00:10:53.221 --> 00:10:57.090
<v Speaker 3>people has ever done more good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that is true.</v>

236
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.760
<v Speaker 3>They do so much good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so charitable.</v>

237
00:10:59.761 --> 00:11:01.790
<v Speaker 3>They're always involved in all these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

238
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.630
<v Speaker 3>charitable</v>
<v Speaker 3>functions and go to the shitty parts of</v>

239
00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:11.631
<v Speaker 3>the world to adopt like 50 kids a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Constantly adopting kids.</v>

240
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.180
<v Speaker 3>This gang of kids have a gang of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's entirely true.</v>

241
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you have all those kids at</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>

242
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.000
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a tribe.</v>

243
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.850
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet they each have a nanny.</v>

244
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.930
<v Speaker 3>The nanny think they each have a spotter</v>
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

245
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:30.870
<v Speaker 3>each kid has their own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether the dudes boring or not,</v>

246
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe those fucking interviews are</v>

247
00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:33.570
<v Speaker 3>boring to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

248
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:34.423
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's far.</v>

249
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:36.870
<v Speaker 3>Jesus wasn't the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if it was Larry King.</v>

250
00:11:36.871 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember who the hell it was he</v>

251
00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:39.534
<v Speaker 3>was talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was,</v>

252
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.400
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was in the other room and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

253
00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:43.590
<v Speaker 3>who is this boring dude?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's getting interviewed.</v>

254
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.820
<v Speaker 3>And then I turned the corner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

255
00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.850
<v Speaker 3>that's Brad Pitt proud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're boring,</v>

256
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.790
<v Speaker 3>boring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should be fucking psyched.</v>

257
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.990
<v Speaker 3>He should be like a brat pack.</v>

258
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really funny when you go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

259
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:57.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have like people come into town,</v>

260
00:11:57.101 --> 00:11:58.660
<v Speaker 1>they always want to go to a taping of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

261
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.570
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I've used whatever connection I</v>

262
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:02.021
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

263
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:05.350
<v Speaker 1>we'll go to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love watching the painful look on the</v>

264
00:12:05.351 --> 00:12:07.300
<v Speaker 1>interviewer's face during commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

265

<v Speaker 1>where they're just reaching and it's</v>

267
00:12:13.661 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I can tell,</v>

268
00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're very likable and they're good at</v>

270
00:12:18.971 --> 00:12:21.340
<v Speaker 1>it and a chatty and work the crowd and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

271
00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Like I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like Nick Cannon was on</v>

272
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Ellen I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give two shits about.</v>

273
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:32.590
<v Speaker 1>But the guy did it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was good with that audience.</v>

274
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.101
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

275
00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 1>he said the little funny jokes and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was real and then I saw some other guy</v>

276
00:12:37.091 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 1>go on and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

277
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:43.681
<v Speaker 1>this is one of my first interviews I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>given on empire.</v>

278
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:45.850
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch empire,</v>

279
00:12:45.851 --> 00:12:49.450
<v Speaker 1>and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sad clown in the audience.</v>

280
00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.660
<v Speaker 1>He had prepped whatever it was he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to say,</v>

281
00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:55.570
<v Speaker 1>but everything he wanted to say was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking lame.</v>

282
00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.360
<v Speaker 1>You just had to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her face was just like [inaudible]</v>

283
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.750
<v Speaker 3>just struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going through the whole thing.</v>

284
00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:06.470
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

285
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.600
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the worst part about those shows</v>

286
00:13:08.601 --> 00:13:11.750
<v Speaker 3>and the best part about doing a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I only have people on that I want</v>

287
00:13:11.751 --> 00:13:13.550
<v Speaker 3>to have on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's all up to me.</v>

288
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.320
<v Speaker 3>I decide like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

289
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.430
<v Speaker 3>maybe Jenny Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hi,</v>

290

<v Speaker 3>five.</v>

291
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.810
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then those people,</v>

292
00:13:20.811 --> 00:13:24.980
<v Speaker 3>they have to get like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are on radio shows or radio</v>

293
00:13:24.981 --> 00:13:27.710
<v Speaker 3>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't ever interview radio show people.</v>

294
00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.050
<v Speaker 3>I think I made that up other than Howard</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stern.</v>

295
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.900
<v Speaker 3>What radio guy ever gets interviewed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

296
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:33.763
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

297
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.930
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say like rush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they have to.</v>

298
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.070
<v Speaker 3>They have to interview people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't really give a fuck about.</v>

299
00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.520
<v Speaker 3>It's like CNN or whoever it is that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>work for.</v>

300
00:13:40.521 --> 00:13:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Sets it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of my favorite ones was when Chelsea</v>

<v Speaker 3>handler was on with a fuckhead.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's a nice guy.</v>

307
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.790
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we stop saying that he's gross on</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a show.</v>

324
00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.420
<v Speaker 3>He would just start checking his phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at twitter and really seeing</v>

<v Speaker 3>Pull up a pierce.</v>

347
00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:52.420
<v Speaker 3>Morgan gets destroyed by Ben Shapiro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of love that though.</v>

348
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:56.590
<v Speaker 3>I like when people are just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't stand all that stupid so.</v>

349
00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.410
<v Speaker 3>Well those shows that whole type of</v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

350
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:01.520
<v Speaker 3>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

351
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:03.350
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it only exists because you have a</v>

352
00:16:03.351 --> 00:16:03.981
<v Speaker 3>network,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

353
00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 3>So you have a network which is this</v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic thing that has had programs on</v>

354
00:16:07.161 --> 00:16:10.370
<v Speaker 3>forever and they have all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>advertisers that they do business with</v>

355
00:16:10.371 --> 00:16:12.170
<v Speaker 3>and they have these commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're gonna sell.</v>

356
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:17.210
<v Speaker 3>So essentially the show is only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only an advertiser for advertisers.</v>

357
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.210
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all these interviews and all the</v>

358
00:16:20.211 --> 00:16:23.300
<v Speaker 3>different programs they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all they're doing is trying to get you</v>

359
00:16:23.301 --> 00:16:26.060
<v Speaker 3>to lock in long enough so they could</v>
<v Speaker 3>slip an add in.</v>

360
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:29.840
<v Speaker 3>So every 15 minutes I'll slip ads in and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they sell.</v>

361
00:16:29.841 --> 00:16:34.220
<v Speaker 3>What they really sell is ads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So didn't give a fuck what you want.</v>

362
00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:35.900
<v Speaker 3>It's not personality driven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

363
00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.960
<v Speaker 3>It's not about establishing something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting and fascinating.</v>

364
00:16:38.961 --> 00:16:40.310
<v Speaker 3>And Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing good work here.</v>

365
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just about selling ads like that.</v>

366
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.630
<v Speaker 3>I was a news producer for like almost 12</v>
<v Speaker 3>years where you really were a and</v>

367
00:16:47.631 --> 00:16:48.980
<v Speaker 3>Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>San Antonio and Houston.</v>

368
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas knows top producing first and then</v>

369
00:16:54.291 --> 00:16:56.450
<v Speaker 3>I just wanted to make more money so I</v>
<v Speaker 3>got the news,</v>

370
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.110
<v Speaker 3>but it was still like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

371
00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:02.150
<v Speaker 3>you have to know all that crap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to get your stories.</v>

372
00:17:02.151 --> 00:17:05.590
<v Speaker 3>And here was a watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is pierce Morgan gets owned by but</v>

373
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:08.450
<v Speaker 3>in a video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I found like a five minute version.</v>

374
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.293
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

375
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:18.870
<v Speaker 4>in American</v>
<v Speaker 4>TV series</v>

376
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:26.600
<v Speaker 4>American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why am I of only on this issue?</v>

377
00:17:27.041 --> 00:17:28.390
<v Speaker 4>Because what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've seen it,</v>

378
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.740
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you tend to do is you tend to</v>

379
00:17:32.741 --> 00:17:36.630
<v Speaker 4>demonize people who differ from you</v>
<v Speaker 4>politically standing on the grades that</v>

380
00:17:36.631 --> 00:17:38.440
<v Speaker 4>the children will see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not saying they don't seem to care</v>

381
00:17:38.441 --> 00:17:40.690
<v Speaker 4>enough about the decades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they cared more about the decades,</v>

382
00:17:40.691 --> 00:17:43.940
<v Speaker 4>they would agree with you on policy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we can have a rational political</v>

383
00:17:43.941 --> 00:17:48.010
<v Speaker 4>conversation about balancing rights and</v>
<v Speaker 4>risks and rewards of all of these</v>

384
00:17:48.011 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 4>different policies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that what we need to</v>

385
00:17:50.221 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 4>do is humanize people on the other side</v>
<v Speaker 4>is as being unfeeling about that,</v>

386
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:56.680
<v Speaker 4>about what happened in January.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You accused me of standing up the</v>

387
00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.010
<v Speaker 4>grades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen you do it.</v>

388
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.790
<v Speaker 4>Liquors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I say,</v>

389
00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.200
<v Speaker 4>update.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me.</v>

390
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.890
<v Speaker 4>You can keep saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you've done it repeatedly.</v>

391
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.630
<v Speaker 4>Well what you do and you keep sending</v>
<v Speaker 4>those folks if they disagree with you</v>

392
00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:13.080
<v Speaker 4>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then somehow this is a violation of what</v>

393
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:16.560
<v Speaker 4>happened in Sandy Hook and you get I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really like to hear your policy</v>

394
00:18:16.561 --> 00:18:20.730
<v Speaker 4>prescriptions for what we should do</v>
<v Speaker 4>about guns because you respect the</v>

395
00:18:20.731 --> 00:18:23.340
<v Speaker 4>second amendment and you know I brought</v>
<v Speaker 4>this here for you so that you can read</v>

396
00:18:23.341 --> 00:18:24.460
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Constitution.</v>

397
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.210
<v Speaker 4>I really like for you to explain to me</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you would do about guns that would</v>

398
00:18:29.211 --> 00:18:30.840
<v Speaker 4>have prevented what happened in Sandy</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hook.</v>

399
00:18:30.841 --> 00:18:32.280
<v Speaker 4>If you want to do what you did in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>UK,</v>

400
00:18:32.281 --> 00:18:33.031
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is banned,</v>

401
00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:35.280
<v Speaker 4>virtually all gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is at least a fair argument and we</v>

402
00:18:35.281 --> 00:18:38.220
<v Speaker 4>can have a discussion about whether</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's something that we ought to do</v>

403
00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.610
<v Speaker 4>very clear what I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is exactly what Kelly wants to do</v>

404
00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.350
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rather than talk about that rather than</v>

405
00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:49.040
<v Speaker 4>address your comments to me about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>staffing of the grades of children</v>

406
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.960
<v Speaker 4>starting to trust them too long because</v>
<v Speaker 4>he agrees with everything I've been</v>

407
00:18:52.961 --> 00:18:54.360
<v Speaker 4>saying because he thinks the same way.</v>

408
00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.970
<v Speaker 1>What does that do to talk to someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else?</v>

409
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Gabby giffords.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it?</v>

410
00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's just now picking a different</v>

411
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:09.530
<v Speaker 1>shooting</v>
<v Speaker 1>total.</v>

412
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.040
<v Speaker 1>Now we got him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He agrees.</v>

413
00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:17.530
<v Speaker 1>What was it like doing news work is fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it bleeds,</v>

414
00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:18.430
<v Speaker 1>it leads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

415
00:19:18.431 --> 00:19:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Like what are the conversations that</v>
<v Speaker 1>nightcrawler show with nightcrawler</v>

416
00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.340
<v Speaker 1>movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what somebody get burned back at</v>

417
00:19:24.341 --> 00:19:25.720
<v Speaker 1>babies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd have a lead tonight</v>

418
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.060
<v Speaker 1>per and a bag of</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever's new.</v>

419
00:19:31.061 --> 00:19:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Whatever's you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Houston,</v>

420
00:19:32.741 --> 00:19:35.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it'd be an apartment fire</v>

421
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.750
<v Speaker 1>southwest Houston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's just whatever's happening.</v>

422
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

423
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:42.130
<v Speaker 1>it's local news and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Austin I did more sports which</v>

424
00:19:42.131 --> 00:19:46.960
<v Speaker 1>was more fun and then when I made the</v>
<v Speaker 1>transition to news I was in San Antonio</v>

425
00:19:46.961 --> 00:19:49.690
<v Speaker 1>and in Houston and it's as a producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

426
00:19:49.691 --> 00:19:52.010
<v Speaker 1>you write the newscast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're writing with the anchor site,</v>

427
00:19:52.011 --> 00:19:54.880
<v Speaker 1>they're talking heads and then you go in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the booth,</v>

428
00:19:54.881 --> 00:19:57.190
<v Speaker 1>you all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

429
00:19:57.191 --> 00:20:01.420
<v Speaker 1>two and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was fun for awhile and then I think</v>

430
00:20:01.421 --> 00:20:02.890
<v Speaker 1>it actually got under my skin a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

431
00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I was always doing like comedy and stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and everything on the side.</v>

432
00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:10.740
<v Speaker 1>And then when I realized I could do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>full time instead of news I got out</v>

433
00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:15.010
<v Speaker 1>while you were doing the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were still doing stand up around</v>

434
00:20:15.011 --> 00:20:17.950
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was this during the last stop days?</v>

435
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.300
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

436
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Houston and in Austin it was like 2000</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 2004,</v>

437
00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:29.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I opened at cap city one time,</v>

438
00:20:29.451 --> 00:20:34.390
<v Speaker 1>but I did like the ones on sixth street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Velveeta room was just learning.</v>

439
00:20:34.391 --> 00:20:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I was just starting out so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that great.</v>

440
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't gonna be a headliner at cap</v>
<v Speaker 1>city at that point.</v>

441
00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.460
<v Speaker 1>What is it like working with</v>
<v Speaker 1>newscasters?</v>

442
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Because they are the most bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 1>television personality.</v>

443
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Like there's really nobody that is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogant</v>

444
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.380
<v Speaker 2>than your local newscaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

445
00:20:50.381 --> 00:20:55.381
<v Speaker 2>it's not because it's that person that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>been there forever and everyone around</v>

446
00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:57.850
<v Speaker 2>town knows him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the moment they cross out of town,</v>

447
00:20:57.851 --> 00:20:59.500
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just,</v>

448
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:03.400
<v Speaker 2>they're very big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big egos and sometimes they'll try to,</v>

449
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:05.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flex nuts and god isn't ready.</v>

450
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.430
<v Speaker 2>I just sit down old man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

451
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:10.900
<v Speaker 2>just put the thing on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I would never take shit from them,</v>

452
00:21:10.901 --> 00:21:14.080
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of people would get their</v>
<v Speaker 2>feelings hurt sometimes.</v>

453
00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Bizarre folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're in the entertainment.</v>

454
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.180
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're essentially.</v>

455
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What their entertainment is like.</v>

456
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.400
<v Speaker 2>They have a voice that's soothing for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the news,</v>

457
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a way of delivering the news.</v>

458
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like the way someone would sing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>song where like it,</v>

459
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:35.040
<v Speaker 2>the melodies sort of like interacts with</v>

576
00:26:57.391 --> 00:27:00.390
<v Speaker 2>like the beginning of the end for me</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I couldn't stop,</v>

577
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:01.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do it.</v>

578
00:27:01.741 --> 00:27:04.470
<v Speaker 2>I used to do like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything felt very personal.</v>

579
00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

580
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:07.920
<v Speaker 2>So that was kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sucked.</v>

581
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.271
<v Speaker 2>But I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

582
00:27:09.271 --> 00:27:12.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad I did it for as long as I did</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I did well.</v>

583
00:27:12.031 --> 00:27:14.190
<v Speaker 2>But do you talk about it on stage at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all?</v>

584
00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>

585
00:27:16.711 --> 00:27:20.220
<v Speaker 2>But</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess sometimes it just depends on the</v>

586
00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:22.580
<v Speaker 2>context or whatever's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes we'll talk about it.</v>

587
00:27:22.581 --> 00:27:25.950
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it'd be right or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>write something about it because it</v>

588
00:27:25.951 --> 00:27:30.480
<v Speaker 2>seems like it would be so ripe for</v>
<v Speaker 2>material and just what it's like.</v>

589
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.970
<v Speaker 2>That movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is night stocker,</v>

590
00:27:31.971 --> 00:27:33.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Xeloda is nightcrawler.</v>

591
00:27:33.211 --> 00:27:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Nightcrawler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't even seen that one yet,</v>

592
00:27:35.131 --> 00:27:38.550
<v Speaker 2>but I heard it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really creepy.</v>

593
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Jake Gyllenhaal will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will.</v>

594
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.160
<v Speaker 2>He looks wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shirt and shit.</v>

595
00:27:42.161 --> 00:27:44.400
<v Speaker 2>He's all scrawny and creepy looking now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so good.</v>

596
00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.010
<v Speaker 2>He's such a good creeper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's perfect.</v>

597
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.840
<v Speaker 2>It's like maybe it's too good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I just think he's got it off.</v>

598
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.180
<v Speaker 2>He can become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that guy in the but he can become</v>

599
00:27:54.181 --> 00:27:54.850
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

600
00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:57.480
<v Speaker 2>Know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he just did such a good job of</v>

601
00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:02.340
<v Speaker 2>capturing the sort of sociopathic</v>
<v Speaker 2>personality of someone who would</v>

602
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:06.180
<v Speaker 2>ambulance chaser and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think that happens a lot.</v>

603
00:28:06.181 --> 00:28:08.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean people that want to get the</v>
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

604
00:28:08.071 --> 00:28:12.090
<v Speaker 2>break the story first and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to break a story first,</v>

605
00:28:12.091 --> 00:28:13.530
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's something horrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

606
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.550
<v Speaker 2>you do feel like when you're done it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

607
00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just trying to call people and trying to</v>

608
00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:21.780
<v Speaker 2>dig up shit and you're just wasn't for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

609
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:25.710
<v Speaker 2>After awhile I could imagine I have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>friend who's a cop and he's told me that</v>

610
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:29.970
<v Speaker 2>they'll get to a scene and someone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>had been shot and people,</v>

611
00:28:29.971 --> 00:28:30.680
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

612
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.970
<v Speaker 2>no one even bats an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll,</v>

613
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
<v Speaker 2>they'll start eating donuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally eating donuts like right</v>

614
00:28:36.001 --> 00:28:38.250
<v Speaker 2>next to the body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like no one to care for them.</v>

615
00:28:38.251 --> 00:28:39.810
<v Speaker 2>It's work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a crime scene and start</v>

616
00:28:39.811 --> 00:28:40.890
<v Speaker 2>cracking jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

617
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:42.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

618
00:28:42.051 --> 00:28:43.020
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

619
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:46.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say like I went there</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean sometimes I,</v>

620
00:28:46.321 --> 00:28:48.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we would see a video,</v>

621
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.240
<v Speaker 2>the full video before it's been edited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we would edit out the dead per.</v>

622
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.230
<v Speaker 2>And it is weird when you're just doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and thinking absolutely nothing of</v>

623
00:28:58.231 --> 00:28:59.880
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just cut that.</v>

624
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:03.600
<v Speaker 2>Is there any pressure to show like more</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

625
00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:08.090
<v Speaker 2>there's like libel laws that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow in news like in,</v>

626
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.790
<v Speaker 2>you have to know those going into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what you can and can't say what you</v>

627
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.890
<v Speaker 2>can and can't show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

628
00:29:13.891 --> 00:29:16.650
<v Speaker 2>you can't say like you were saying like</v>
<v Speaker 2>allegedly or you know,</v>

629
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.330
<v Speaker 2>there's certain things like that.</v>

630
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:23.330
<v Speaker 2>You can't say it's a fact when it's just</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it has to come from a legit news</v>

631
00:29:23.551 --> 00:29:25.800
<v Speaker 2>source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Associated Press or CNN,</v>

632

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

633
00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.520

<v Speaker 2>that you got the information from.</v>

636
00:29:35.011 --> 00:29:37.830
<v Speaker 2>credible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite ones was this a news</v>

<v Speaker 6>take a look at this scene.</v>

651
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.410
<v Speaker 6>What is happening right here behind me?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can see that firefighters are still</v>

652
00:30:25.411 --> 00:30:28.380
<v Speaker 6>working to make sure that this fire is</v>
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>

653
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:32.100
<v Speaker 6>Smoke is still in the hearing and</v>
<v Speaker 6>firefighters are still over here trying</v>

654
00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.440
<v Speaker 6>to make sure that everything gets under</v>
<v Speaker 6>control.</v>

<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

658
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.313
<v Speaker 6>What happened?</v>

659
00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:47.940
<v Speaker 7>I woke up and said beating on the doors.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My neighbors.</v>

660
00:30:47.941 --> 00:30:49.980
<v Speaker 7>I opened up the door.</v>

<v Speaker 7>so well opened up the door.</v>

663
00:30:53.431 --> 00:30:57.000
<v Speaker 7>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just blazing from the garage and I woke</v>

664
00:30:57.001 --> 00:30:58.380
<v Speaker 7>him up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my husband</v>

<v Speaker 7>had him go back in the house to get our</v>

667
00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:07.980
<v Speaker 7>two dogs that we had in there.</v>

668
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.280
<v Speaker 6>When you got outside and you saw what</v>
<v Speaker 6>was happening,</v>

669
00:31:11.281 --> 00:31:13.860
<v Speaker 6>you saw what was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what were your thoughts face in the</v>

670
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.210
<v Speaker 6>background?</v>
<v Speaker 6>My Gosh.</v>

671
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:16.223
<v Speaker 6>Oh my gosh.</v>

672
00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.180
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't ever think it was going to</v>

673
00:31:18.181 --> 00:31:19.014
<v Speaker 7>happen to us.</v>

674
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.420
<v Speaker 6>Do you know how this buyer story up?</v>

675
00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:23.103
<v Speaker 7>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I do.</v>

676
00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:27.030
<v Speaker 7>It was cousin my cousin and I don't want</v>
<v Speaker 7>to mention no names.</v>

677
00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.030
<v Speaker 6>And you said you think your cousin</v>
<v Speaker 6>started this?</v>

678
00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.570
<v Speaker 6>Do you know how or why?</v>

679
00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.790
<v Speaker 7>He's mad because he couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He can't get with me.</v>

680
00:31:36.791 --> 00:31:39.320
<v Speaker 7>I'm married to my husband and</v>

681
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:41.990
<v Speaker 6>my second cousin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Marie short?</v>

682
00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:43.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he put it.</v>

683
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.830
<v Speaker 6>He already put him in the hospital once</v>
<v Speaker 6>last month.</v>

684
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:49.000
<v Speaker 2>I figured he's going to do something</v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

685
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Should be on cost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not on the news for the look at the guy.</v>

686
00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.000
<v Speaker 2>How is he not dying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Laughing?</v>

687
00:31:58.300 --> 00:31:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not very good at his job either.</v>

688
00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.070
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tough gig.</v>

689
00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.370
<v Speaker 2>It is a tough Gig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a normal reaction to</v>

690
00:32:06.371 --> 00:32:08.920
<v Speaker 2>someone saying that he normally acts was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a what?</v>

691
00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Your cousin hold up.</v>

<v Speaker 3>using tanning beds,</v>

<v Speaker 3>1,600 bucks a month for rent in DC.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders.</v>

752
00:34:57.871 --> 00:34:59.820
<v Speaker 3>You think he's lying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bernie,</v>

753
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I think Brittany needs to run for like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>homeowners association</v>

754
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:08.810
<v Speaker 1>in Boca Raton or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie,</v>

755
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.250
<v Speaker 1>a nice cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sac,</v>

756
00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:16.440
<v Speaker 1>the sac ping pong championships on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one percent of the CULDESAC.</v>

757
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders is an interesting guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

758
00:35:20.331 --> 00:35:23.720
<v Speaker 1>He's at least getting young people</v>
<v Speaker 1>excited because they're hoping and</v>

759
00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:26.750
<v Speaker 1>praying that someone is different and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is different but him.</v>

760
00:35:26.751 --> 00:35:30.230
<v Speaker 1>He's the one guy that's coming along,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's saying trump's different in,</v>

761
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:31.550
<v Speaker 1>in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a bad way,</v>

762
00:35:31.551 --> 00:35:34.760
<v Speaker 1>but he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually will say I was backed into a</v>

763
00:35:34.761 --> 00:35:35.910
<v Speaker 1>corner and somebody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

764
00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.860
<v Speaker 1>say something nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad he's not lying.</v>

765
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

766
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.010
<v Speaker 2>believe he believes every single thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he's saying.</v>

767
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:43.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he has a team of campaign</v>
<v Speaker 2>managers telling them what to say.</v>

768
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:49.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure that he just gets up</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and just start spewing crazy.</v>

769
00:35:49.591 --> 00:35:52.560
<v Speaker 2>But he believes that lets it rip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's worth a few billion.</v>

770
00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:53.161
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

771
00:35:53.161 --> 00:35:54.100
<v Speaker 2>let's roll the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

772
00:35:54.101 --> 00:35:54.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

773
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.820
<v Speaker 2>there's something that's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious about that part,</v>

774
00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:58.710
<v Speaker 2>but other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all full of shit.</v>

775
00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:03.510
<v Speaker 2>There's a recent bill or a vote that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to take place in the UK to try to</v>

776
00:36:03.511 --> 00:36:05.970
<v Speaker 2>ban him from entering the UK for hate</v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

777
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.650
<v Speaker 2>This is like a serious consideration and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going on right now.</v>

778
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.270
<v Speaker 2>He's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for uh,</v>

779
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that he said about Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just said,</v>

780
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some point you're like,</v>

781
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I think that everybody was kind of on</v>
<v Speaker 2>board at first.</v>

782
00:36:21.301 --> 00:36:24.810
<v Speaker 2>Like all the old crazies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody saying what we're all thinking</v>

783
00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:29.010
<v Speaker 2>that it's kind of people and then he</v>
<v Speaker 2>just hasn't stopped talking and I think</v>

784
00:36:29.011 --> 00:36:30.800
<v Speaker 2>now they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

785
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.033
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

786
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.340
<v Speaker 2>come on buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you crossed we get your back.</v>

787
00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.750
<v Speaker 2>But now kind of spewing some crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

788
00:36:37.751 --> 00:36:42.390
<v Speaker 2>I actually think that like all these old</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that like him believe that Muslim</v>

789
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:47.100
<v Speaker 2>is a terrorist organization group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't think that they get that.</v>

790
00:36:47.101 --> 00:36:49.530
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like they think Al Jazeera,</v>

791
00:36:49.531 --> 00:36:54.531
<v Speaker 2>that's actually a TV channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a like the Taliban that Brown</v>

792
00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Peoples Jihad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jihad,</v>

793
00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:02.940
<v Speaker 2>Jihad and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

794
00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:06.030
<v Speaker 2>well people are terrified of people from</v>
<v Speaker 2>other cultures,</v>

795
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.570
<v Speaker 2>but when you've got all their cultures</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are involved and things like,</v>

796
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.720
<v Speaker 2>you know when Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when people have to understand is</v>

797
00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:16.140
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isis is killing more Muslims in there.</v>

798
00:37:16.141 --> 00:37:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Are Anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the people that they're killing</v>

799
00:37:18.811 --> 00:37:19.644
<v Speaker 2>or Muslims?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

800
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:22.230
<v Speaker 2>Like they know they're just bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this battle that they're,</v>

801
00:37:22.231 --> 00:37:24.870
<v Speaker 2>they're like they're criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

802
00:37:24.871 --> 00:37:28.290
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why this annoys me,</v>

803
00:37:28.291 --> 00:37:30.720
<v Speaker 2>but when I'm watching the news or</v>
<v Speaker 2>reading the news,</v>

804
00:37:30.721 --> 00:37:33.450
<v Speaker 2>which I prefer to read it because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>annoys me,</v>

805
00:37:33.451 --> 00:37:35.640
<v Speaker 2>not watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people will say,</v>

806
00:37:35.641 --> 00:37:37.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know we're waiting to find out if</v>

807
00:37:37.111 --> 00:37:40.200
<v Speaker 2>this was a terrorist attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the San Bernandino thing before</v>

808
00:37:40.201 --> 00:37:41.430
<v Speaker 2>they release those names.</v>

809
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Once they released their names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore it became a terrorist attack.</v>

810
00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:47.790
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that like the Sandy Hook</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guy,</v>

811
00:37:47.791 --> 00:37:51.560
<v Speaker 2>that was kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was terrorizing people,</v>

812
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:55.770
<v Speaker 2>but I like that they have to be a brown</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to be a terrorist.</v>

813
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:56.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's our new.</v>

814
00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that weird though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our new enemies,</v>

815
00:37:58.771 --> 00:38:01.890
<v Speaker 2>the war on terror and terror has to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

816
00:38:01.891 --> 00:38:03.720
<v Speaker 2>It's like the Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to go up to the Germans and the</v>

817
00:38:03.721 --> 00:38:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Japanese or the terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the terrorists.</v>

818
00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.370
<v Speaker 2>It's country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what does tear me,</v>

819
00:38:08.371 --> 00:38:09.950
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't mean brown people do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

820
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.150
<v Speaker 2>We renamed the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Japan,</v>

821
00:38:12.151 --> 00:38:15.030
<v Speaker 2>they call themselves the poem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know what we're</v>

822
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.940
<v Speaker 2>going to wait because I remember Pearl</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harbor.</v>

823
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.160
<v Speaker 2>There's all these people that believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are in other countries,</v>

824
00:38:20.161 --> 00:38:23.010
<v Speaker 2>but as Americans we get to dictate what</v>
<v Speaker 2>their actual alarms are,</v>

825
00:38:23.011 --> 00:38:24.870
<v Speaker 2>so we're just going to decide to call it</v>
<v Speaker 2>all terror.</v>

826
00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:27.450
<v Speaker 2>So these are terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They live in terror.</v>

827
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:29.810
<v Speaker 2>That's the part of the world called</v>
<v Speaker 2>care.</v>

828
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:33.930
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to come over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll put you in camps like we did the</v>

829
00:38:33.931 --> 00:38:34.764
<v Speaker 2>japs.</v>

830
00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.450
<v Speaker 1>That's some dark shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

831
00:38:37.451 --> 00:38:40.990
<v Speaker 1>So horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to my mom who lives in</v>

832
00:38:40.991 --> 00:38:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Houston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative Republican and all those</v>

833
00:38:43.121 --> 00:38:45.100
<v Speaker 1>fun things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I love poking her at the stick.</v>

834
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:47.170
<v Speaker 1>It's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when she said,</v>

835
00:38:47.171 --> 00:38:49.540
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was terrorists in San Bernardino,</v>

836
00:38:49.541 --> 00:38:51.040
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

837
00:38:51.041 --> 00:38:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean anybody that did that is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist.</v>

838
00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we find out what their name was,</v>

839
00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Jenny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrorists are like the really bad</v>

840
00:38:58.751 --> 00:39:02.050
<v Speaker 1>ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

841
00:39:02.051 --> 00:39:03.070
<v Speaker 1>I begged him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

842
00:39:03.071 --> 00:39:04.540
<v Speaker 1>I think the Sandy Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty bad.</v>

843
00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was awesome.</v>

844
00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:09.150
<v Speaker 3>The fucking Colorado movie theater guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a terrorist.</v>

845
00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.120
<v Speaker 3>No white guy with the orange hair of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>real bad ones though.</v>

846
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:13.650
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can print announces.</v>

847
00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can pronounce his name,</v>

848
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.420
<v Speaker 3>just not as bad as the guys that saw he</v>
<v Speaker 3>lumped.</v>

849
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:22.590
<v Speaker 3>That'd be that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad stuff.</v>

850
00:39:22.591 --> 00:39:23.630
<v Speaker 3>Bad News.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

851
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:27.600
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it bugs me when people won't criticize</v>

852
00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.510
<v Speaker 3>Islamic terrorists or Islamic people</v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

853
00:39:30.511 --> 00:39:33.120
<v Speaker 3>because they are worried about being</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamophobic.</v>

854
00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:36.390
<v Speaker 3>Like Islamophobia is a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird one though.</v>

855
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's a phobic like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like if you're on a watch list or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

859
00:39:43.231 --> 00:39:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm drawing a big fucking blank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it called me?</v>

860
00:39:47.311 --> 00:39:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudging somebody here.</v>

861
00:39:48.781 --> 00:39:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

862
00:39:50.071 --> 00:39:53.150
<v Speaker 1>there was some prescreening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

863
00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:54.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're making an assumption here.</v>

864
00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:55.980
<v Speaker 1>I've stereotype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

865
00:39:55.981 --> 00:39:56.814
<v Speaker 1>like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

866
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:59.640
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes</v>

867
00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I heard this couple one time I was</v>

868
00:40:04.561 --> 00:40:08.920
<v Speaker 1>on a flight and this family and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely dressed Muslim,</v>

869
00:40:08.921 --> 00:40:11.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the face covered in magazines,</v>

870
00:40:11.851 --> 00:40:13.170
<v Speaker 1>old people just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

871
00:40:13.171 --> 00:40:14.790
<v Speaker 1>the Gilligan's island,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old people,</v>

872
00:40:14.791 --> 00:40:15.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

873
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:20.510
<v Speaker 1>and they're like hitting each other like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy.</v>

874
00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:21.811
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

875
00:40:21.811 --> 00:40:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I care about the guys that are going to</v>

876
00:40:24.481 --> 00:40:27.970
<v Speaker 1>come on board with slacks that they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>just bought at Mervyn's or something and</v>

877
00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:31.410
<v Speaker 1>will button down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still get creases like no luggage,</v>

878
00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

879
00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:37.380
<v Speaker 1>if that's who's going to freak me out on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a plane as the ones that just are trying</v>

880
00:40:37.381 --> 00:40:39.220
<v Speaker 1>to fit in fuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out of their shoe,</v>

881
00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:42.630
<v Speaker 1>not the ones that are like fully</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing out with all of it.</v>

882
00:40:42.631 --> 00:40:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

883
00:40:43.501 --> 00:40:45.500
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I,</v>

884
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:47.160
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will prejudge.</v>

885
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm not going to just go,</v>

886
00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.020
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to offend anybody so let me</v>

887
00:40:52.021 --> 00:40:53.880
<v Speaker 1>get on this plane at these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy people.</v>

888
00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I was getting at is it,</v>

889
00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:58.740
<v Speaker 3>it's just weird that people will call</v>
<v Speaker 3>you out on being Islamophobic,</v>

890
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.170
<v Speaker 3>but at the same people will openly mock</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christians.</v>

891
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.093
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

892
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:05.080
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can openly mock scientologists they</v>

893
00:41:05.081 --> 00:41:05.730
<v Speaker 3>should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

894
00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:07.620
<v Speaker 3>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>

895
00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:08.920
<v Speaker 3>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I guess the,</v>

896
00:41:08.921 --> 00:41:13.650
<v Speaker 3>the legit angle would be obviously</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're at war.</v>

897
00:41:13.651 --> 00:41:17.220
<v Speaker 3>We were at war with two different</v>
<v Speaker 3>countries and we're still in</v>

898
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.240
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

899
00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.750
<v Speaker 3>A lot of troops still in Iraq and more</v>
<v Speaker 3>now than before.</v>

900
00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.490
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we just send some new ones over</v>

901
00:41:23.491 --> 00:41:24.324
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

902
00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:29.160
<v Speaker 3>And those people that are involved in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conflict over there are Islamic or</v>

903
00:41:29.161 --> 00:41:30.410
<v Speaker 3>are Brown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

904
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 3>So I guess it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it lends the idea</v>

905
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.200
<v Speaker 2>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you shouldn't be Islamophobic,</v>

906
00:41:36.201 --> 00:41:40.820
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be critical or prejudice</v>
<v Speaker 2>against Islamic people,</v>

907
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:45.410
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an ideology like lucky first of</v>

908
00:41:45.411 --> 00:41:47.330
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

909
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:49.970
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any religion is stupid,</v>

910
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:54.440
<v Speaker 2>but they're all dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just watching bill burrs stand up</v>

911
00:41:54.441 --> 00:41:57.650
<v Speaker 2>and I was laughing so damn hard about</v>
<v Speaker 2>and talking about scientology and he</v>

912
00:41:57.651 --> 00:41:57.891
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

913
00:41:57.891 --> 00:41:59.160
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you're,</v>

914
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.950
<v Speaker 2>God's name is Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

915
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:04.490
<v Speaker 2>get a driver's license and a social</v>
<v Speaker 2>security card.</v>

916
00:42:04.491 --> 00:42:06.440
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I found out about it when I was an</v>

917
00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:07.310
<v Speaker 2>adult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're a kid,</v>

918
00:42:07.311 --> 00:42:09.030
<v Speaker 2>you don't question it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

919
00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:09.921
<v Speaker 2>grew up Catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

920
00:42:09.921 --> 00:42:10.341
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

921
00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:11.270
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would you?</v>

922
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

924
00:42:13.471 --> 00:42:13.920

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

925

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

927
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Like you just believe it and then as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get older to challenge it or to question</v>

928
00:42:19.401 --> 00:42:21.980
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an asshole.</v>

929
00:42:21.981 --> 00:42:22.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you just can't,</v>

930
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:24.560
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't challenge the Bible,</v>

931
00:42:24.561 --> 00:42:25.460
<v Speaker 2>don't it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

932
00:42:25.461 --> 00:42:26.294
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>

933
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:29.210
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a higher power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's that story,</v>

934
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:31.820
<v Speaker 2>but maybe a version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not.</v>

935
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:34.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what it is,</v>

936
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.920
<v Speaker 2>but whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not what l Ron Hubbard wrote.</v>

937
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:40.910
<v Speaker 2>It's not the one guy who wrote the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>books of anybody who ever wrote books,</v>

938
00:42:40.911 --> 00:42:43.950
<v Speaker 2>ever scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote five books,</v>

939
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:45.410
<v Speaker 2>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote more fiction.</v>

940
00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Any person's ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He really did.</v>

941
00:42:47.681 --> 00:42:49.970
<v Speaker 2>He did have one person that's ever lived</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the planet.</v>

942
00:42:49.971 --> 00:42:53.450
<v Speaker 2>He wrote the most books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible that they think that</v>

943
00:42:53.451 --> 00:42:54.470
<v Speaker 2>that city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

944
00:42:54.850 --> 00:42:56.710
<v Speaker 2>Fuck load.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly a fuck load.</v>

945
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:58.220
<v Speaker 2>Fuck load.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exact number.</v>

946
00:42:58.290 --> 00:42:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of books.</v>

947
00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.770
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>James is gonna.</v>

948
00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:01.850
<v Speaker 2>Pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna find out,</v>

949
00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.490
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote the hold the distinction.</v>

950
00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:09.110
<v Speaker 2>She's the most prolific fiction author</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever in the history of the human race.</v>

951
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:13.760
<v Speaker 2>That's how stupid scientology is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy who made up the most shit ever</v>

952
00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:19.200
<v Speaker 2>also told the truth about the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>frozen ice cubes filled with Metta</v>

953
00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:22.610
<v Speaker 2>volcanoes and volcanic and that's why</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get anxious.</v>

954
00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:26.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>

955
00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:29.450
<v Speaker 2>it's all so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Swimming across the board that's made up</v>

956
00:43:29.451 --> 00:43:31.070
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's people making things up,</v>

957
00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:33.890
<v Speaker 2>but you live and you die and no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows what happens when you die.</v>

958
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.690
<v Speaker 2>We'll all find out one day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully.</v>

959
00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we won't.</v>

960
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it will become something that</v>

961
00:43:38.631 --> 00:43:42.500
<v Speaker 2>doesn't think here it is.</v>

971
00:44:09.701 --> 00:44:12.170
<v Speaker 2>a big part of what he was doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>originally.</v>

972
00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:14.940
<v Speaker 2>Wiki would get books published in those,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think it was like the nineties.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that he had laying around.</v>

980
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:34.700

985
00:44:43.321 --> 00:44:44.820
<v Speaker 2>because he looks crazy.</v>

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:20.340
<v Speaker 2>they lived in clearwater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My sister still lives in Tampa.</v>

1041
00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:23.310
<v Speaker 2>There's still still down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that where you're from?</v>

1042
00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:24.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1043
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:26.160
<v Speaker 2>They moved there to escape the Boston</v>
<v Speaker 2>winters.</v>

1044
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Now they're just trapped and trapped in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sea of stupid.</v>

1045
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.720
<v Speaker 2>A lot of Nice people down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>

1046
00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:39.430
<v Speaker 2>I was just there in Tampa this past</v>
<v Speaker 2>weekend.</v>

1047
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:42.760
<v Speaker 2>You know what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all people from the northeast that</v>

1048
00:47:42.761 --> 00:47:45.520
<v Speaker 2>escaped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all my whole show was like New</v>

1049
00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:46.241
<v Speaker 2>Yorkers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston people,</v>

1050
00:47:46.241 --> 00:47:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Jersey people were tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People just get out of their fucking get</v>

1051
00:47:49.421 --> 00:47:51.160
<v Speaker 2>a job down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck winter.</v>

1052
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:53.140
<v Speaker 2>They just say fuck winter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they'd go to Florida.</v>

1053
00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:56.050
<v Speaker 2>I would do the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I grew up in south Texas,</v>

1054
00:47:56.051 --> 00:47:58.150
<v Speaker 2>so like an admin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 50 degrees out here and I'm like,</v>

1055
00:47:58.151 --> 00:47:59.530
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's freezing.</v>

1056
00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:02.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm such A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't deal with.</v>

1057
00:48:02.021 --> 00:48:04.160
<v Speaker 2>It will sound like Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I dunno.</v>

1058
00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:08.920
<v Speaker 2>I love Houston spots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got is it's got character.</v>

1059
00:48:08.921 --> 00:48:11.110
<v Speaker 2>If you're downtown and there's a lot to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1060
00:48:11.111 --> 00:48:12.100
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1061
00:48:12.101 --> 00:48:13.600
<v Speaker 2>there's a life down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that.</v>

1062
00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:15.070
<v Speaker 2>But then there are certain places that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1063
00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:15.960
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that fun.</v>

1064
00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I was in Boston,</v>

1065
00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:20.980
<v Speaker 2>there was essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was four big comedy scenes that</v>

1066
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:22.990
<v Speaker 2>we'd heard about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was the Boston scene,</v>

1067
00:48:22.991 --> 00:48:24.970
<v Speaker 2>there was the New York scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a,</v>

1068
00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:28.570
<v Speaker 2>the La scene is kind of a San Francisco</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem a little bit,</v>

1069
00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:32.050
<v Speaker 2>but there was a Houston scene and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Houston scene was because of Kennison</v>

1070
00:48:32.051 --> 00:48:37.030
<v Speaker 2>and Hicks Hicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where he was such a fan of his.</v>

1071
00:48:37.031 --> 00:48:39.780
<v Speaker 2>But like now they just have the Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

1072
00:48:39.781 --> 00:48:44.350
<v Speaker 2>I did a show at the Improv over</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas break and it's awesome.</v>

1073
00:48:44.351 --> 00:48:46.780
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking huge too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great venue,</v>

1074
00:48:46.781 --> 00:48:49.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of in a weird part of town</v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

1075
00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just,</v>

1076
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:52.630
<v Speaker 2>you mean black?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1077
00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:56.210
<v Speaker 2>it's out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really,</v>

1078
00:48:56.211 --> 00:48:59.770
<v Speaker 2>it's not a black part of town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They only seem to book a lot of black</v>

1079
00:48:59.771 --> 00:49:00.590
<v Speaker 2>comedians.</v>

1080
00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>

1081
00:49:01.991 --> 00:49:05.260
<v Speaker 2>it's just off of the interstate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an exit,</v>

1082
00:49:05.261 --> 00:49:07.420
<v Speaker 2>you know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a weird part of town.</v>

1083
00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Like there's just nothing really around</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1084
00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:12.430
<v Speaker 2>You're just kind of like hauling ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1085
00:49:12.431 --> 00:49:14.650
<v Speaker 2>I 10 and then you take an exit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the Improv.</v>

1086
00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:18.100
<v Speaker 2>So sad because that place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the laptop in river oaks,</v>

1087
00:49:18.101 --> 00:49:20.920
<v Speaker 2>that's where I know that was the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did my first CD there.</v>

1088
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Ninety nine was the shit,</v>

1089
00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:26.440
<v Speaker 2>it was the best club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was set up.</v>

1090
00:49:26.441 --> 00:49:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it was like a restaurant and I think</v>

1091
00:49:29.171 --> 00:49:32.380
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to get it where they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least open part of it up.</v>

1092
00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:35.360
<v Speaker 2>It's still there for comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a different uh,</v>

1093
00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.001
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1094
00:49:36.001 --> 00:49:37.180
<v Speaker 2>it's a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a restaurant,</v>

1095
00:49:37.181 --> 00:49:38.250
<v Speaker 2>bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant and that,</v>

1096
00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:39.820
<v Speaker 2>but as the stage still there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1097
00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:41.830
<v Speaker 2>No it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're trying to,</v>

1098
00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:43.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all the comedians are going,</v>

1099
00:49:43.301 --> 00:49:45.220
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give us a parking the.</v>

1100
00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Because there are a lot of good</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians and he just,</v>

1101
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:50.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he wanted to be able to like do your</v>

1102
00:49:50.861 --> 00:49:54.040
<v Speaker 2>job and then try to do this on the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what I always enjoyed about</v>

1103
00:49:54.041 --> 00:49:55.660
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1104
00:49:55.661 --> 00:49:59.890
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to go to the Improv or try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get some stage time or sometimes I would</v>

1105
00:49:59.891 --> 00:50:01.810
<v Speaker 2>open up for my friends that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>musicians.</v>

1106
00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I would just do a set at their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1107
00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:07.360
<v Speaker 2>so at least I could get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could get stage time,</v>

1108
00:50:07.361 --> 00:50:09.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's tough though.</v>

1109
00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So non ideal.</v>

1110
00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:13.001
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1111
00:50:13.001 --> 00:50:15.760
<v Speaker 2>it helped that I already had a job so I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't care as much.</v>

1112
00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:16.601
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1113
00:50:16.601 --> 00:50:19.720
<v Speaker 2>like if I was depending on that as my</v>
<v Speaker 2>livelihood,</v>

1114
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.450
<v Speaker 2>maybe I would have been more nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was like,</v>

1115
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:21.850
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine,</v>

1116
00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:24.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to work tomorrow is</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the more frustrating things for a</v>

1117
00:50:24.581 --> 00:50:25.360
<v Speaker 2>young comedian.</v>

1118
00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:27.200
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're starting out is to grow up a</v>

1119
00:50:27.201 --> 00:50:30.710
<v Speaker 2>town that doesn't have a scene play now</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're in Cleveland or something like</v>

1120
00:50:30.711 --> 00:50:31.860
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if Cleveland as a scene,</v>

1121
00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:36.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these clubs like the Improv are</v>

1122
00:50:36.021 --> 00:50:38.630
<v Speaker 2>amazing to work out if you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>professional.</v>

1123
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:40.910
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've done,</v>

1124
00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:44.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of shows at the Improv here,</v>

1125
00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:49.040
<v Speaker 2>but it's only because maybe somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>asked and they had to pull strings</v>

1126
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:50.960
<v Speaker 2>because I'm not a name for a marquee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1127
00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.810
<v Speaker 2>and you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for the Improv you have to be like</v>

1128
00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:58.310
<v Speaker 2>trying to get on at the store or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh factory.</v>

1129
00:50:58.311 --> 00:51:00.890
<v Speaker 2>And on like a Saturday night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to just go,</v>

1130
00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:03.860
<v Speaker 2>hey yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go do seven minutes.</v>

1131
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've sort of boxed themselves into</v>

1132
00:51:05.841 --> 00:51:10.841
<v Speaker 2>this whole though because you're the</v>
<v Speaker 2>only will they have these rooms that are</v>

1133
00:51:11.001 --> 00:51:15.140
<v Speaker 2>like 500 seats so they can't have open</v>
<v Speaker 2>mic nights because they can't keep the</v>

1134
00:51:15.141 --> 00:51:17.930
<v Speaker 2>room open because they can't eat all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>staff and everything.</v>

1135
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:19.550
<v Speaker 2>It'll cost them too much money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1136
00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:22.610
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as you don't have open mic</v>
<v Speaker 2>nights then you're not developing new</v>

1137
00:51:22.611 --> 00:51:24.140
<v Speaker 2>talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you're not developing new</v>

1138
00:51:24.141 --> 00:51:28.670
<v Speaker 2>talent then you have to get all your ax</v>
<v Speaker 2>in from out of town and it just,</v>

1139
00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:32.300
<v Speaker 2>it kills the whole art form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to have a place to start,</v>

1140
00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no one place where everybody</v>

1141
00:51:34.851 --> 00:51:35.810
<v Speaker 2>starts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say,</v>

1142
00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.180
<v Speaker 2>oh well they have open mic nights in La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about it.</v>

1143
00:51:38.350 --> 00:51:40.240
<v Speaker 2>We'll start out in la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1144
00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I came out here and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>started doing just.</v>

1145
00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:44.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing more writing,</v>

1146
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:46.760
<v Speaker 2>but I still like doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like trying to do stand up,</v>

1147
00:51:46.761 --> 00:51:47.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

1148
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:49.580
<v Speaker 2>three nights a week or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's hard to even get that</v>

1149
00:51:49.581 --> 00:51:50.930
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the laugh factory.</v>

1150
00:51:50.931 --> 00:51:51.830
<v Speaker 2>They're good to me over there.</v>

1151
00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:53.320
<v Speaker 2>And they'll give me a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1152
00:51:53.330 --> 00:51:53.961
<v Speaker 2>Monday,</v>

1161
00:52:08.121 --> 00:52:10.460
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have to find everything myself.</v>

1162
00:52:10.461 --> 00:52:12.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't rely on like my agent to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1163
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Like it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I still do that.</v>

1165
00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:20.330
<v Speaker 2>I just find everything myself to day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You find that because I like sitting</v>

00:52:26.301 --> 00:52:28.490
<v Speaker 2>And especially like little clubs in</v>

1171
00:52:31.311 --> 00:52:32.510
<v Speaker 2>my agents do all that stuff.</v>

1172
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:35.390

<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1201
00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:44.220
<v Speaker 2>It's actually really pretty cool</v>
<v Speaker 2>considering like I moved here from</v>

<v Speaker 2>Houston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1203
00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.730
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just no scene.</v>

1204
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:51.620
<v Speaker 2>It just wasn't there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't exist so used to.</v>

1205
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:54.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that used to be one of the best places.</v>

1206
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:59.600
<v Speaker 2>When I first got there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I first got to Houston in like 96 or 97,</v>

1207
00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.280
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 90,</v>

1208
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:04.470
<v Speaker 2>maybe 98 either way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1209
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:07.140
<v Speaker 2>when I first got there I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1210
00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:10.740
<v Speaker 2>They had an open mic night that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>start at like eight and go till 2:00 in</v>

1211
00:54:10.741 --> 00:54:11.490
<v Speaker 2>the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1212
00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:14.560
<v Speaker 2>And the open mic night was in the bar</v>
<v Speaker 2>area where they had a small stage and</v>

1213
00:54:14.561 --> 00:54:16.770
<v Speaker 2>then they had the main stage with a main</v>
<v Speaker 2>room was,</v>

1214
00:54:16.771 --> 00:54:19.800
<v Speaker 2>which was fucking perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the perfect setup and they had</v>

1215
00:54:19.801 --> 00:54:24.240
<v Speaker 2>all these really creative young local</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians and they didn't have any</v>

1216
00:54:24.241 --> 00:54:26.030
<v Speaker 2>tolerance for hacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1217
00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:28.080
<v Speaker 2>this is just like Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like hot,</v>

1218
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:32.370
<v Speaker 2>like hot weather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody can put their finger on why</v>

1219
00:54:32.371 --> 00:54:35.640
<v Speaker 2>it stopped because the club went under.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that easy to throw water on a fire</v>

1220
00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:38.880
<v Speaker 2>if they don't have anywhere to perform</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if there's no one seen like,</v>

1221
00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:41.580
<v Speaker 2>like somebody than try to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just felt like there would be</v>

1222
00:54:41.581 --> 00:54:44.250
<v Speaker 2>somebody that would make more of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>effort to try to get it right,</v>

1223
00:54:44.251 --> 00:54:47.070
<v Speaker 2>but who do it like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1224
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I always thought that there would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody that would try to bring it back</v>

1225
00:54:50.611 --> 00:54:51.241
<v Speaker 2>up again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>

1226
00:54:51.241 --> 00:54:53.730
<v Speaker 2>Well they tried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you need like real resources.</v>

1227
00:54:53.731 --> 00:54:56.040
<v Speaker 2>You need a club,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need a liquor license,</v>

1228
00:54:56.041 --> 00:54:56.880
<v Speaker 2>you need a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1229
00:54:56.881 --> 00:54:59.360
<v Speaker 2>you need the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're idiots.</v>

1230
00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:01.890
<v Speaker 2>Can open bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many bar owners do you know?</v>

1231
00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know any idiots that owned bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know it?</v>

1232
00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:08.940
<v Speaker 2>Idiots it on bars really a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really Talk to those idiots.</v>

1233
00:55:08.941 --> 00:55:09.900
<v Speaker 2>Tell him to put a stage up.</v>

1234
00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking.</v>

1235
00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:15.390
<v Speaker 2>It's not like anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>

1236
00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:18.780
<v Speaker 2>if you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess being a musician was probably</v>

1237
00:55:18.781 --> 00:55:21.530
<v Speaker 2>just as difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how does that mean?</v>

1238
00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:23.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you can kind of make your own</v>

1239
00:55:23.221 --> 00:55:25.430
<v Speaker 2>mix tape and shit alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need.</v>

1240
00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:28.710
<v Speaker 2>You don't need an audience to practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the difference between comedy and</v>

1241
00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:32.070
<v Speaker 2>other art forms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need an audience to practice to know</v>

1242
00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:32.851
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1243
00:55:32.851 --> 00:55:34.500
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing that I always enjoyed</v>
<v Speaker 2>about twitter.</v>

1244
00:55:34.501 --> 00:55:37.620
<v Speaker 2>You can kind of tell if something a joke</v>
<v Speaker 2>works or doesn't work on twitter by</v>

1245
00:55:37.621 --> 00:55:38.820
<v Speaker 2>people liking it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1246
00:55:38.821 --> 00:55:39.720
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like,</v>

1247
00:55:39.721 --> 00:55:40.650
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that works,</v>

1248
00:55:40.651 --> 00:55:44.640
<v Speaker 2>so let me try it verbally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a big following on twitter just</v>

1249
00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:46.250
<v Speaker 2>from being funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1250
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Bert Chrysler and I were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>you one day,</v>

1251
00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:50.890
<v Speaker 2>the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why I say that message?</v>

1252
00:55:50.891 --> 00:55:53.830
<v Speaker 2>It was all my friends were like sending</v>
<v Speaker 2>me the link to it and like,</v>

1253
00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:54.750
<v Speaker 2>oh sweet.</v>

1254
00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a cool thing about twitter</v>

1255
00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:59.940
<v Speaker 2>is it's like there's a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She calls herself slash lien.</v>

1256
00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:00.751
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love her.</v>

1257
00:56:00.751 --> 00:56:03.540
<v Speaker 2>She's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's up in Toronto.</v>

1258
00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.480
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She developed this giant following just</v>

1259
00:56:06.481 --> 00:56:10.230
<v Speaker 2>from being funny and I think that like</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like her myself,</v>

1260
00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm like Rob Delaney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all kind of jumped in at the exact</v>

1261
00:56:15.331 --> 00:56:18.810
<v Speaker 2>same time and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's possible now for</v>

1262
00:56:18.811 --> 00:56:21.900
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's too many people that</v>

1263
00:56:21.901 --> 00:56:23.350
<v Speaker 2>people always say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

1264
00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:26.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to start a podcast now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's got a podcast,</v>

1265
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:26.950
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

1266
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:28.780
<v Speaker 2>how about those guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We fucked girls.</v>

1267
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Those girls that have that podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>called guys we fucked.</v>

1268
00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I'd never heard of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never heard of it.</v>

1269
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:36.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like top 10 always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's only been around for like</v>

1270
00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:38.180
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just have a really good podcast,</v>

1271
00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:41.410
<v Speaker 2>developed as big as following and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>shot up through the rankings,</v>

1272
00:56:41.411 --> 00:56:41.920
<v Speaker 2>like quit.</v>

1273
00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:43.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that podcasts I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

1274
00:56:43.721 --> 00:56:45.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that yeah,</v>

1275
00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.130
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people have them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still would encourage people to</v>

1276
00:56:48.131 --> 00:56:49.780
<v Speaker 2>try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with twitter,</v>

1277
00:56:49.781 --> 00:56:51.690
<v Speaker 2>the only thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1278
00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:54.340
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so new and different and</v>

1279
00:56:54.341 --> 00:56:55.350
<v Speaker 2>everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is that per,</v>

1280
00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:57.730
<v Speaker 2>you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was so new and exciting and now</v>

1281
00:56:57.731 --> 00:57:00.490
<v Speaker 2>there's all this other crap either</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's too many things,</v>

1282
00:57:00.491 --> 00:57:01.690
<v Speaker 2>periscope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snapchat,</v>

1283
00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.960
<v Speaker 2>all the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these other social media things and</v>

1284
00:57:04.961 --> 00:57:09.961
<v Speaker 2>at the time it was just like facebook</v>
<v Speaker 2>and twitter and I was at twitter doesn't</v>

1285
00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:11.800
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't grow like it used to.</v>

1286
00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:15.100
<v Speaker 2>The amount of people that you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people don't like you.</v>

1287
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:18.910
<v Speaker 2>Some people used to get like massive</v>
<v Speaker 2>amounts of new followers like really</v>

1288
00:57:18.911 --> 00:57:20.680
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's hard to do that now.</v>

1289
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:23.940
<v Speaker 2>I think also like if you look at someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you look to see like,</v>

1290
00:57:24.070 --> 00:57:25.480
<v Speaker 2>like how many people do you follow?</v>

1291
00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:30.960
<v Speaker 2>I follow a lot of people and you read</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single shit.</v>

1292
00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:33.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got something wrong with me.</v>

1293
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:38.220
<v Speaker 2>I scan twitter constantly for</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting stories and if someone</v>

1294
00:57:38.471 --> 00:57:39.990
<v Speaker 2>posts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll look through their feed.</v>

1295
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:40.920
<v Speaker 2>They post two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

1296
00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:42.580
<v Speaker 2>four interesting stories in a row and</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

1297
00:57:42.581 --> 00:57:43.720
<v Speaker 2>I follow him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1298
00:57:43.721 --> 00:57:45.060
<v Speaker 2>you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how do you find them?</v>

1299
00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Just through somebody retreating number</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something.</v>

1300
00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Most of it is because they tweet things</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

1301
00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:50.380
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1302
00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:53.250
<v Speaker 2>So someone will tweet something really</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool to me and uh,</v>

1303
00:57:53.251 --> 00:57:56.410
<v Speaker 2>I retweet it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what I've started doing,</v>

1304
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:59.920
<v Speaker 2>I started doing a long time ago is when</v>
<v Speaker 2>people send me cool stuff,</v>

1305
00:57:59.950 --> 00:58:04.330
<v Speaker 2>I retweet it because it gives people an</v>
<v Speaker 2>incentive to send you more cool stuff</v>

1306
00:58:04.331 --> 00:58:04.961
<v Speaker 2>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1307
00:58:04.961 --> 00:58:06.040
<v Speaker 2>retweeted me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>

1308
00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:10.330
<v Speaker 2>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like when I find their page,</v>

1309
00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:13.600
<v Speaker 2>like if someone retweets something or if</v>
<v Speaker 2>I retweet something someone sent me and</v>

1310
00:58:13.601 --> 00:58:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I find their page and they have a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of cool shit on there,</v>

1311
00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:16.900
<v Speaker 2>I'll start following them.</v>

1312
00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:22.290
<v Speaker 2>And I think that just that way you</v>
<v Speaker 2>ensure that you have like sort of a</v>

1313
00:58:22.421 --> 00:58:26.380
<v Speaker 2>network of people that are distributing</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting information,</v>

1314
00:58:26.381 --> 00:58:27.770
<v Speaker 2>sending it your way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a link.</v>

1315
00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:31.210
<v Speaker 2>Is it links to things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's links to things that are.</v>

1316
00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's just a funny not apply to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1317
00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's funny reply sometimes.</v>

1318
00:58:35.711 --> 00:58:39.700
<v Speaker 2>It's just a funny post now how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfunny replies you get from people</v>

1319
00:58:39.701 --> 00:58:41.270
<v Speaker 2>trying to make you laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1320
00:58:41.271 --> 00:58:46.230
<v Speaker 2>You get those that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just cluttered and it's just,</v>

1321
00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's so pull.</v>

1322
00:58:47.731 --> 00:58:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Yours is so humor based,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1323
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:52.510
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're almost insulting me.</v>

1324
00:58:52.511 --> 00:58:53.530
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

1325
00:58:53.531 --> 00:58:54.650
<v Speaker 2>And they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's getting,</v>

1326
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:55.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like as a joke,</v>

1327
00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:57.670
<v Speaker 2>a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1328
00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:58.990
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1329
00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:00.453
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

1330
00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Well you got to think there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are just trying anything to</v>

1331
00:59:03.191 --> 00:59:04.540
<v Speaker 2>get a reaction from you.</v>

1332
00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:08.860
<v Speaker 2>They're standing out there hyping until</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get a signal back.</v>

1333
00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

1334
00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:15.180
<v Speaker 2>it's such an interesting concept that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like,</v>

1335
00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:18.670
<v Speaker 2>like I did a panel at south by southwest</v>
<v Speaker 2>last year,</v>

1336
00:59:18.671 --> 00:59:19.540
<v Speaker 2>two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1337
00:59:19.541 --> 00:59:20.770
<v Speaker 2>And it was just it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1338
00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:24.530
<v Speaker 2>And it was just about like getting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>career out of it,</v>

1339
00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:27.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how else would anybody have noticed</v>

1340
00:59:27.111 --> 00:59:30.080
<v Speaker 2>me outside of Houston?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's how I noticed you.</v>

1341
00:59:30.081 --> 00:59:31.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember when I started noticing</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1342
00:59:31.641 --> 00:59:34.220
<v Speaker 2>but I've been following you for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long have you been on twitter?</v>

1343
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:37.820
<v Speaker 2>Since like 2009.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I the thing I've been following you for</v>

1344
00:59:37.821 --> 00:59:40.220
<v Speaker 2>at least two years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least two years.</v>

1345
00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:45.520
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know how long totally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I remember a guy tweeted one of your</v>

1346
00:59:45.771 --> 00:59:48.500
<v Speaker 2>things like to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think someone tweeted something funny</v>

1347
00:59:48.501 --> 00:59:52.400
<v Speaker 2>that you said and I think I retweeted it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I started following you.</v>

1348
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:53.960
<v Speaker 2>That's how I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's really.</v>

1349
00:59:53.961 --> 00:59:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of,</v>

1350
00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:57.320
<v Speaker 2>it's word of mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>word of word,</v>

1351
00:59:57.350 --> 00:59:58.850
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could still do that,</v>

1352
00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:00.320
<v Speaker 2>but I do think that's fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1353
01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.050
<v Speaker 2>that's what I love about twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really fascinating that.</v>

1354
01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:07.520
<v Speaker 2>How else would anybody I've ever heard</v>
<v Speaker 2>of me if it wasn't for that particular</v>

1355
01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:10.280
<v Speaker 2>form of social media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think there's too much now.</v>

1356
01:00:10.281 --> 01:00:13.850
<v Speaker 2>There's too many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's too many extra things that I</v>

1357
01:00:13.851 --> 01:00:16.910
<v Speaker 2>don't think people are going to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed that way that I lucked out and</v>

1358
01:00:16.911 --> 01:00:18.230
<v Speaker 2>got out of this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>When you're going to be billions of</v>

1381
01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:21.830
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Billions and now he's got a new baby.</v>

1382
01:01:21.831 --> 01:01:23.590
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His wife just had a baby.</v>

1383
01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.190
<v Speaker 2>He's Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he takes pictures of everything is</v>

1384
01:01:26.191 --> 01:01:27.770
<v Speaker 2>why it was baby.</v>

1385
01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:29.840

01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:31.100
<v Speaker 2>like he's getting the jump.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well maybe he's just surrounded by</v>

<v Speaker 2>fucking Spec ops guys just locked and</v>

<v Speaker 2>cool at first and then all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started getting friend requests</v>

<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like on this side of the road,</v>

1415
01:02:49.831 --> 01:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm holding my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like eating an apple and she took</v>

1416
01:02:52.141 --> 01:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>a picture but it was so beautiful behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and I put that on instagram like,</v>

1418
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>And then I had these people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1419
01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:00.030
<v Speaker 1>you have to stay at Fenton.</v>

1420
01:03:00.070 --> 01:03:01.890
<v Speaker 1>That's where you have to stay and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to go eat.</v>

1421
01:03:01.891 --> 01:03:05.100
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think I drove from La to big Sur</v>

1422
01:03:05.101 --> 01:03:09.210
<v Speaker 1>without a plan of where I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay and what I'm going to do?</v>

1423
01:03:09.211 --> 01:03:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Like they're telling me what I need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1424
01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.233
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just trying to help.</v>

1425
01:03:12.740 --> 01:03:14.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in a different way.</v>

1426
01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:14.761
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1427
01:03:14.761 --> 01:03:17.160
<v Speaker 1>you need to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know if it's like a deep</v>

1428
01:03:17.161 --> 01:03:21.510
<v Speaker 1>seated like as a kid being told that or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that it's just so obnoxious to</v>

1429
01:03:21.511 --> 01:03:22.111
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1430
01:03:22.111 --> 01:03:24.360
<v Speaker 1>It's like I know I have a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry.</v>

1431
01:03:24.361 --> 01:03:25.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

1432
01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:27.750
<v Speaker 1>You're a bit of a rebel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see what's now.</v>

1433
01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:32.370
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm probably an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bit of an asshole is probably more</v>

1434
01:03:32.371 --> 01:03:34.050
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always assume it's.</v>

1435
01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.360
<v Speaker 1>We have very different reactions to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

1436
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:39.180
<v Speaker 1>I always assume that it's people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in town that are trying to help me</v>

1437
01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:40.830
<v Speaker 1>out and steer me towards a good story.</v>

1438
01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:42.450
<v Speaker 1>You look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they live in Vermont or</v>

1439
01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:43.380
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just like,</v>

1440
01:03:43.381 --> 01:03:45.480
<v Speaker 1>they've been there once and telling me</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do,</v>

1441
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:47.910
<v Speaker 1>but don't you think that just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>steer you in the right direction.</v>

1442
01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:48.721
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

1443
01:03:48.721 --> 01:03:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell me what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1444
01:03:49.801 --> 01:03:50.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're horrible people.</v>

1445
01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:56.280
<v Speaker 1>I think they're terrorist sympathizers</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the sympathizers,</v>

1446
01:03:56.281 --> 01:03:58.080
<v Speaker 1>yet they're all about isis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1447
01:03:58.081 --> 01:03:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I always think they're just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help out.</v>

1448
01:03:59.941 --> 01:04:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy it when people do that.</v>

1449
01:04:02.191 --> 01:04:04.860
<v Speaker 1>I even asked for suggestions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll ask for.</v>

1450
01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.080
<v Speaker 1>That's different now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll ask for suggestions.</v>

1451
01:04:07.081 --> 01:04:07.561
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1452
01:04:07.561 --> 01:04:09.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm in big Sur and then it's like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to go eat here,</v>

1453
01:04:09.661 --> 01:04:11.010
<v Speaker 1>you need to stay here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1454
01:04:11.011 --> 01:04:12.300
<v Speaker 1>you have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need.</v>

1455

<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1456
01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.500
<v Speaker 1>if you made it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worded it in a way that was like,</v>

1457
01:04:16.501 --> 01:04:19.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where you're staying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I could tell you like I stayed here</v>

1458
01:04:19.581 --> 01:04:21.450
<v Speaker 1>at one time and it was fantastic.</v>

1459
01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:23.150
<v Speaker 1>It was more of like the telling me what</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

1460
01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.220
<v Speaker 1>You think that people say that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's awesome like,</v>

1461
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:27.990

<v Speaker 1>you need to check this out.</v>

1462
01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:31.890
<v Speaker 1>I find sometimes people do it to let me</v>
<v Speaker 1>know they've been places.</v>

1463
01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Does that ever happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like I have that jacket too.</v>

1469
01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Do you react?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it like men telling you to go</v>

1470
01:04:50.851 --> 01:04:52.120
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and do things?</v>

1475
01:04:59.551 --> 01:05:01.090
<v Speaker 1>whatever it kicks up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like pollen,</v>

01:05:50.130 --> 01:05:52.380
<v Speaker 1>He would have had instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1495
01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1496
01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:54.670
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not yours.</v>

1497
01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Not My dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would probably,</v>

1498
01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:58.890
<v Speaker 1>he would have been more of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1499
01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:00.160
<v Speaker 1>like when you're a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1500
01:06:00.161 --> 01:06:03.160
<v Speaker 1>you walk in your Dad's watching tv and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's just tits on the</v>

1501
01:06:03.161 --> 01:06:05.440
<v Speaker 1>screen here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get on there,</v>

1502
01:06:05.441 --> 01:06:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skinemax or whatever these flipping</v>

1503
01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:11.650
<v Speaker 1>through and then I walk in and surprise</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and he,</v>

1504
01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:14.890
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just trying to figure out those</v>

1505
01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:15.930
<v Speaker 1>goddamn remote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1506
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:16.690
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1507
01:06:16.690 --> 01:06:17.523
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>

1508
01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:19.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what he grew up in a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>

1509
01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:20.940
<v Speaker 1>If he grew up today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1510
01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.730
<v Speaker 1>your era definitely formed you in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1511
01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:26.650
<v Speaker 1>My parents were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad and I were like,</v>

1512
01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:29.050
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years younger than my parents.</v>

1513
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:30.730
<v Speaker 1>My Dad's no longer with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my.</v>

1514
01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were just older people that had</v>

1515
01:06:32.921 --> 01:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>kids later in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1516
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:36.580
<v Speaker 1>there was still banging it out late in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1517
01:06:36.581 --> 01:06:37.414
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1518
01:06:37.930 --> 01:06:40.210
<v Speaker 1>They were like married for I think like</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years before that.</v>

1519
01:06:40.211 --> 01:06:41.560
<v Speaker 1>My sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1520
01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the downside would be like my sister</v>

1521
01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:44.951
<v Speaker 1>and I'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1522
01:06:44.951 --> 01:06:47.350
<v Speaker 1>we want to go to California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to Disneyland.</v>

1523
01:06:47.351 --> 01:06:48.184
<v Speaker 1>Disney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1524
01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:49.780
<v Speaker 1>and I know we've been there a million</v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

1525
01:06:51.470 --> 01:06:52.860
<v Speaker 1>just say all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1526
01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:57.580
<v Speaker 1>that's makes me sad as a dad</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my kids,</v>

1527
01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.700
<v Speaker 1>we always did shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we were.</v>

1528
01:06:59.701 --> 01:07:02.010
<v Speaker 1>We grew up on the water so we had like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1529
01:07:02.020 --> 01:07:03.730
<v Speaker 1>we always ended with beach boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sailboat.</v>

1530
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:07.420
<v Speaker 1>We had all the fun stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we were in the Gulf that</v>

1531
01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.680
<v Speaker 1>water</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil spills up that motherfucker</v>

1532
01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:16.960
<v Speaker 1>now probably a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there were so many when I</v>

1533
01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:18.340
<v Speaker 1>was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't digging,</v>

1534
01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:21.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1535
01:07:21.790 --> 01:07:26.470
<v Speaker 1>I went to Santa Barbara recently after</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big oil spill in the Gulf.</v>

1536
01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Whenever I see those fucking things out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the water,</v>

1537
01:07:29.681 --> 01:07:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's a ticking time bomb.</v>

1538
01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's going to fuck up eventually.</v>

1539
01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:36.010
<v Speaker 1>And then this beautiful beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have oil all over it.</v>

1540
01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Well the odds of it fucking upper</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>

1541
01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:43.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean you think about how many rigs are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the water and how many spills there</v>

1542
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:45.250
<v Speaker 1>have actually been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1543
01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:46.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1544
01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:50.680
<v Speaker 1>it's not the odds of all of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1545
01:07:50.681 --> 01:07:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Having a a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a spill is pretty.</v>

1546
01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:55.660
<v Speaker 1>It's fairly low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly low and it's,</v>

1547
01:07:55.661 --> 01:07:58.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's always like human error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just they're not hiring and it's</v>

1548
01:07:58.691 --> 01:08:01.450
<v Speaker 1>always bp and I always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think it's always bp.</v>

1549
01:08:01.451 --> 01:08:05.200
<v Speaker 1>They don't hire the right people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not always other companies with the</v>

1550
01:08:05.201 --> 01:08:10.201
<v Speaker 1>last big BP oil spill to cut corners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fact that they cut corners and</v>

1551
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:12.880
<v Speaker 1>the way they constructed it because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were behind budget,</v>

1552
01:08:12.881 --> 01:08:15.920
<v Speaker 1>but exactly the amount of they have</v>

1553
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:21.100
<v Speaker 2>versus the amount of accidents that</v>
<v Speaker 2>occur and the devastation that occurs</v>

1554
01:08:21.111 --> 01:08:22.940
<v Speaker 2>because of the accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one way of looking at it,</v>

1555
01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:26.660
<v Speaker 2>but the other way of looking at it is</v>
<v Speaker 2>when those accidents do occur,</v>

1556
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.430
<v Speaker 2>the fucking catastrophic damage is so</v>
<v Speaker 2>devastating that each one of those</v>

1557
01:08:31.431 --> 01:08:34.730
<v Speaker 2>things is a ticking time bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how long have they been doing it?</v>

1558
01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:36.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've only been doing those offshore</v>

1559
01:08:36.951 --> 01:08:39.320
<v Speaker 2>oil drills for like 30 or 40 years I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

1560
01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:42.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's been more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's been.</v>

1561
01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.500
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just over 40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1562
01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:48.680
<v Speaker 2>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at it like nuclear power.</v>

1563
01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.930
<v Speaker 2>There's only been a couple of nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 2>accidents,</v>

1564
01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:55.310
<v Speaker 2>but those accidents are a fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Fukushima.</v>

1565
01:08:55.311 --> 01:08:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's sort of forgotten about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every.</v>

1566
01:08:57.441 --> 01:09:00.980
<v Speaker 2>I still check on the news or on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fukushima because the mainstream news is</v>

1567
01:09:00.981 --> 01:09:02.750
<v Speaker 2>completely stopped paying attention to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1568
01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:05.600
<v Speaker 2>but if you pay attention to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go and search out,</v>

1569
01:09:05.930 --> 01:09:07.970
<v Speaker 2>it's off cluster fuck over there.</v>

1570
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:10.370
<v Speaker 2>It's really bad and it's not getting any</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

1571
01:09:10.410 --> 01:09:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Like anytime soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1572
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:15.530
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in the town I grew up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually had a nuclear power plant.</v>

1573
01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:16.523
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1574
01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.250
<v Speaker 2>and then riggs everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just.</v>

1575
01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised I don't have like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking arm guard out of my head.</v>

1576
01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:26.060
<v Speaker 2>I have a buddy who was a bone cancer</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he grew up next to a golf course</v>

1577
01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:30.340
<v Speaker 2>and really fucking golfing and gives you</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunk answer.</v>

1578
01:09:30.370 --> 01:09:33.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pesticides they would use on the</v>

1579
01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:34.580
<v Speaker 2>golf course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep the weeds down.</v>

1580
01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sank into the wells and so they had well</v>

1581
01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:41.000
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody on his fucking block.</v>

1582
01:09:41.001 --> 01:09:43.370
<v Speaker 2>Our cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally everybody got cancer</v>

1583
01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:45.170
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well my dad,</v>

1584
01:09:45.171 --> 01:09:46.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He died from cancer,</v>

1585
01:09:46.671 --> 01:09:49.340
<v Speaker 2>but he also worked at a chemical plant</v>
<v Speaker 2>for 37 years,</v>

1586
01:09:49.341 --> 01:09:54.341
<v Speaker 2>so now you can't tell me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that didn't like play into him getting</v>

1587
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:55.970
<v Speaker 2>diagnosed with cancer.</v>

1588
01:09:56.350 --> 01:10:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Just smelling chemicals all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's just no way.</v>

1589
01:10:00.051 --> 01:10:03.260
<v Speaker 2>And I know all the people that he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked with and how many people have</v>

1590
01:10:03.261 --> 01:10:04.040
<v Speaker 2>ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1591
01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.600
<v Speaker 2>getting some fucked up kind of cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's a weird thing going on with</v>

1594
01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:14.810
<v Speaker 2>instagram and social media and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

1595
01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:18.290
<v Speaker 2>that there's this new sort of intimacy</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very difficult to navigate.</v>

1596
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:21.030
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was saying that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sort of contact.</v>

<v Speaker 2>with people that like them or follow</v>

1648
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:33.490
<v Speaker 2>But it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sometimes I'll,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's a joke.</v>

1687
01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:32.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the entire thing has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>following mice.</v>

1688
01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Just randomly type in his name and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because I'm like,</v>

1689
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:38.560
<v Speaker 1>let me see what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it never.</v>

1690
01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:40.810
<v Speaker 1>It never doesn't make me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

1691
01:14:40.811 --> 01:14:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Every single time I've seen some good</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>

1692
01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:45.760
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that are fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked out there just to just say</v>

1693
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:47.860
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I follow them for that.</v>

1694
01:14:48.170 --> 01:14:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Just hoping they're going to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>something stupid.</v>

1695
01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:54.720
<v Speaker 1>I liked the people that will post things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to show you how great their life</v>

1696
01:14:55.151 --> 01:14:58.210
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the humble brag kind of way.</v>

1697
01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Like I remember this one girl was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to show that her son had straight</v>

1698
01:15:04.571 --> 01:15:09.520
<v Speaker 1>a's on his report card and so like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that she was holding it was also to</v>

1699
01:15:09.521 --> 01:15:12.850
<v Speaker 1>show that she was wearing a rolex and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit fucking ring on.</v>

1700
01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:15.640
<v Speaker 1>But it was like perfectly in the frame</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

1701
01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:20.290
<v Speaker 1>But that is amazing that you just did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and I know exactly what you're</v>

1702
01:15:20.291 --> 01:15:25.291
<v Speaker 1>doing but you think you're outsmarting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is so proud of my son.</v>

1703
01:15:26.771 --> 01:15:31.771
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag let my son and then just</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird little monkeys in that regard.</v>

1704

<v Speaker 1>Peacocking monkeys and in some things</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I,</v>

1705

<v Speaker 1>if my sister will send like a picture of</v>

1706

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1707
01:15:44.441 --> 01:15:49.000
<v Speaker 1>everybody likes to do that first day of</v>
<v Speaker 1>school lunchbox backpack and standing in</v>

<v Speaker 2>road and you'd watch someone's swerving</v>

1935
01:25:39.641 --> 01:25:43.500
<v Speaker 2>was talking about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That media I think is too compelling for</v>

1936
01:25:43.501 --> 01:25:47.650
<v Speaker 2>our natural response systems or natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>instincts and reward systems that are in</v>

1937
01:25:47.651 --> 01:25:50.680
<v Speaker 2>place for people like this is too much</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on there.</v>

1938
01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.920

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1940
01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:57.340
<v Speaker 2>but if you ever get like where you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a long flight and there was no Wifi</v>

1941
01:25:57.341 --> 01:26:00.050

<v Speaker 2>play with your phone [inaudible],</v>

1947
01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.550
<v Speaker 2>joke about aids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that was,</v>

1948

<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like one of those people that</v>

1950
01:26:24.890 --> 01:26:25.610

1951
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:29.110

<v Speaker 2>trying to be rude.</v>

01:26:47.691 --> 01:26:49.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sorta like draft kings,</v>

1960
01:26:49.351 --> 01:26:51.860
<v Speaker 2>one of those kinds of companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are fees involved in another</v>

1961
01:26:51.861 --> 01:26:53.600
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are they getting shaken?</v>

1962
01:26:53.601 --> 01:26:56.570
<v Speaker 2>The owners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got too greedy with their</v>

1963
01:26:56.571 --> 01:26:57.860
<v Speaker 2>commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

1964
01:26:57.861 --> 01:27:00.830
<v Speaker 2>Now because everybody that did fantasy</v>
<v Speaker 2>football and shit like that were,</v>

1965
01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:02.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the cool dudes.</v>

1966
01:27:02.941 --> 01:27:05.850
<v Speaker 2>If I go to hooters on Saturday morning</v>
<v Speaker 2>to draft my team,</v>

1967
01:27:05.851 --> 01:27:06.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>

1968
01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:09.740
<v Speaker 2>And I think that it just got to like in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your face like,</v>

1969
01:27:09.741 --> 01:27:10.461
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gambling,</v>

1970
01:27:10.461 --> 01:27:11.030
<v Speaker 2>we don't give a shit.</v>

1971
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:13.070
<v Speaker 2>Here's our ad for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't do that,</v>

1972
01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:15.350
<v Speaker 2>but it should be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should,</v>

1973
01:27:15.690 --> 01:27:18.500
<v Speaker 2>it should totally be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the reason they're in trouble I</v>

1974
01:27:18.501 --> 01:27:21.170
<v Speaker 2>think because they get too greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that why they're in trouble,</v>

1975
01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:22.460
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know about all that stuff.</v>

1976
01:27:23.490 --> 01:27:27.050
<v Speaker 2>Is that whether in trouble sort of sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of there being,</v>

1977
01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:30.020
<v Speaker 2>from what I understand there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're being a little bit deceptive and</v>

1978
01:27:30.021 --> 01:27:33.980
<v Speaker 2>what's actually going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what I've read,</v>

1979
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:37.340
<v Speaker 2>one percent of the people that actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>play are winning like 99 percent of the</v>

1980
01:27:37.341 --> 01:27:39.350
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smart ones like the rest of the world.</v>

1981
01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:43.100
<v Speaker 2>And have some algorithms used to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>professional poker players online.</v>

1982
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1983
01:27:45.411 --> 01:27:48.110
<v Speaker 2>so they've figured out how to do it with</v>
<v Speaker 2>math.</v>

1984
01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:49.033
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1985
01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:52.790
<v Speaker 2>I would not be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1986
01:27:52.791 --> 01:27:56.030
<v Speaker 2>I used to have the sponsor called</v>
<v Speaker 2>lumosity and lumosity is like their</v>

1987
01:27:56.031 --> 01:27:58.430
<v Speaker 2>brain games and they're supposed to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>increase your Iq.</v>

1988
01:27:58.431 --> 01:28:00.140
<v Speaker 2>They're kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're supposed to increase.</v>

1989
01:28:00.620 --> 01:28:05.620
<v Speaker 2>There are games that you play that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually accelerate learning or help you</v>

1990
01:28:06.831 --> 01:28:10.040
<v Speaker 2>learn or make your brain work better or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like three's the.</v>

1991
01:28:10.041 --> 01:28:12.740
<v Speaker 2>There's some number games they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to help you.</v>

1992
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:13.790
<v Speaker 2>Chess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chess.</v>

1993
01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:18.410
<v Speaker 2>It helps your brain while these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>got greedy with their claims and now</v>

1994
01:28:18.411 --> 01:28:21.320
<v Speaker 2>they're fucked and they go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just had a judgment against him for</v>

1995
01:28:21.321 --> 01:28:23.360
<v Speaker 2>like millions of dollars have payback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1996
01:28:23.730 --> 01:28:25.790
<v Speaker 2>because they were saying shit like it</v>
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>

1997
01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:30.680
<v Speaker 2>I guess they had alluded to the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it would help stave off early</v>

1998
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1999
01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:37.220
<v Speaker 2>I had read something about that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was different games and there was</v>

2000
01:28:37.221 --> 01:28:41.520
<v Speaker 2>something that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're driving somewhere and</v>

2001
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:44.450
<v Speaker 2>there was a thing like drive with oven</v>
<v Speaker 2>mitts on or you know.</v>

2002
01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was like do something different.</v>

2003
01:28:46.641 --> 01:28:48.410
<v Speaker 2>Like you always go to the grocery store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go on this.</v>

2004
01:28:48.411 --> 01:28:49.970
<v Speaker 2>I'll start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll start in the middle.</v>

2005
01:28:50.890 --> 01:28:53.690
<v Speaker 2>So as people get older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you get older,</v>

2006
01:28:53.691 --> 01:28:56.060
<v Speaker 2>you really get set in your ways and so</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2007
01:28:56.061 --> 01:28:57.860
<v Speaker 2>to go this way to this place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go the other way.</v>

2008
01:28:58.050 --> 01:28:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how fucked up.</v>

2009
01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:03.330
<v Speaker 2>But something to just kind of jar your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain to make you.</v>

2010
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:04.351
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2011
01:29:04.351 --> 01:29:07.410
<v Speaker 2>Now I have to think because usually</v>
<v Speaker 2>after a while you're just a robot if</v>

2012
01:29:07.690 --> 01:29:10.020
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it exactly the same damn</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2013
01:29:10.021 --> 01:29:12.050
<v Speaker 2>And so different grocery store you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2014
01:29:12.490 --> 01:29:13.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that kind of thing.</v>

2015
01:29:13.591 --> 01:29:17.340
<v Speaker 2>And it was my mom's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told her about this and she goes,</v>

2016
01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:18.070
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2017
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.751
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well tell me.</v>

2018
01:29:18.751 --> 01:29:19.141
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2019
01:29:19.141 --> 01:29:20.580
<v Speaker 2>like when you go to the grocery store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2020
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:22.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go a different route,</v>

2021
01:29:22.411 --> 01:29:24.570
<v Speaker 2>take you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the seventh street and go around</v>

2022
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:25.823
<v Speaker 2>doing that.</v>

2023
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.511
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2024
01:29:27.511 --> 01:29:29.490
<v Speaker 2>well when you have the best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you go and you always start at</v>

2025
01:29:29.491 --> 01:29:31.260
<v Speaker 2>produce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is go start at the bread.</v>

2026
01:29:31.261 --> 01:29:32.940
<v Speaker 2>I only other said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's just stupid.</v>

2027
01:29:32.941 --> 01:29:34.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2028
01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:36.430
<v Speaker 2>well I'll buy and I'll see in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nursing home and always</v>

2029
01:29:38.610 --> 01:29:42.630
<v Speaker 2>trying to help people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird that people have that thing</v>

2030
01:29:42.631 --> 01:29:47.631
<v Speaker 2>where like patterns or they actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of like limit the possibilities</v>

2031
01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:51.810
<v Speaker 2>that your brain has to consider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your brain sort of atrophies almost</v>

2032
01:29:51.811 --> 01:29:52.431
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2033
01:29:52.431 --> 01:29:55.440
<v Speaker 2>like not lifting weights are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercising or something along those</v>

2034
01:29:55.441 --> 01:29:58.770
<v Speaker 2>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I mean like I have to go exercise.</v>

2035
01:29:58.950 --> 01:30:00.780
<v Speaker 2>That helps me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it makes me.</v>

2036
01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:02.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that helps.</v>

2037
01:30:02.671 --> 01:30:04.770
<v Speaker 2>That helps a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you do that before shows?</v>

2038
01:30:04.771 --> 01:30:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Do you find that like if you have an</v>
<v Speaker 2>important show that exercising sort of</v>

2039
01:30:07.471 --> 01:30:08.070
<v Speaker 2>leaving it?</v>

2040
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I try to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me it's cardio like hard cardio or</v>

2041
01:30:12.390 --> 01:30:15.720
<v Speaker 2>do like elliptical machine or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that for like a half an hour before</v>

2042
01:30:15.721 --> 01:30:17.850
<v Speaker 2>show of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh I feel so much better.</v>

2043
01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:21.060
<v Speaker 2>It's almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like I know it doesn't work</v>

2044
01:30:21.061 --> 01:30:23.160
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's almost like I got clean out my</v>

2045
01:30:23.161 --> 01:30:26.400
<v Speaker 2>brain pipes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm just flushing the system blood.</v>

2046
01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:29.670
<v Speaker 2>I know it doesn't really work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually think it does because if you</v>

2047
01:30:29.671 --> 01:30:32.130
<v Speaker 2>ever had a show where you know you've</v>
<v Speaker 2>got somewhere and you're like,</v>

2048
01:30:32.131 --> 01:30:32.610
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to,</v>

2049
01:30:32.610 --> 01:30:34.740
<v Speaker 2>I have to take a nap because I've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

2050
01:30:34.750 --> 01:30:37.560
<v Speaker 2>going to take a nap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wake up to go to the show,</v>

2051
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:39.670
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2052
01:30:40.500 --> 01:30:41.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just woken up.</v>

2053
01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:46.620
<v Speaker 2>I just don't feel as sharp as if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2054
01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:49.230
<v Speaker 2>when I go work out and then I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

2055
01:30:49.231 --> 01:30:50.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to go.</v>

2056
01:30:50.490 --> 01:30:51.271
<v Speaker 2>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2057
01:30:51.271 --> 01:30:55.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't know know exactly what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms are that are going on inside</v>

2058
01:30:55.021 --> 01:30:58.920
<v Speaker 2>the mind when you're exercising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something that the mind gets</v>

2059
01:30:58.921 --> 01:31:03.060
<v Speaker 2>exercised too as well as the body</v>
<v Speaker 2>because your mind has to move the body,</v>

2060
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:08.360
<v Speaker 2>like you think of exercise being a non</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental thing because oh,</v>

2061
01:31:08.521 --> 01:31:10.520
<v Speaker 2>your just immediate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just feel good and working out,</v>

2062
01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:13.110
<v Speaker 2>lifting weights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something that's going on</v>

2063
01:31:13.111 --> 01:31:16.200
<v Speaker 2>while your brain is forcing your body to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do these movements.</v>

2064
01:31:16.210 --> 01:31:18.510
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're exercising willpower,</v>

2065
01:31:18.690 --> 01:31:21.060
<v Speaker 2>you're exercising like determination and</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus.</v>

2066
01:31:21.061 --> 01:31:24.900
<v Speaker 2>There's always things that are going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think accentuate intellectual</v>

2067
01:31:24.901 --> 01:31:25.870
<v Speaker 2>pursuits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2068
01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.150
<v Speaker 2>If that makes any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2069
01:31:27.151 --> 01:31:28.880
<v Speaker 2>it does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like I,</v>

2070
01:31:28.881 --> 01:31:32.880
<v Speaker 2>I go to this boxing gym and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually spar with people but it's just</v>

2071
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:36.110
<v Speaker 2>one on one me and my trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but heel pads on his hands and he,</v>

2072
01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:41.820
<v Speaker 2>I have to do combinations so I have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>think and I know when I start getting</v>

2073
01:31:41.821 --> 01:31:43.800
<v Speaker 2>really tired and I need to contribute a</v>
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>

2074
01:31:43.801 --> 01:31:47.670
<v Speaker 2>like I'll start forgetting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can watch myself be fresh and then I'm</v>

2075
01:31:47.671 --> 01:31:48.421
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh Whoa,</v>

2076
01:31:48.421 --> 01:31:48.961
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2077
01:31:48.961 --> 01:31:50.130
<v Speaker 2>you told me to waive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2078
01:31:50.131 --> 01:31:52.620
<v Speaker 2>hang on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back at it again.</v>

2079
01:31:52.621 --> 01:31:53.950
<v Speaker 2>Let me get a drink of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>

2080
01:31:54.330 --> 01:31:56.950
<v Speaker 2>I like it because it makes me think</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I'm doing something right,</v>

2081
01:31:57.210 --> 01:31:59.280
<v Speaker 2>I still have to concentrate on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2082
01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:00.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2083
01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:03.310
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there is something to it.</v>

2084
01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:05.650
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any,</v>

2085
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:08.050
<v Speaker 3>any sort of exercise that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about?</v>

2086
01:32:08.051 --> 01:32:11.590
<v Speaker 3>Things like they say handball is really</v>
<v Speaker 3>good for the mind,</v>

2087
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:13.000
<v Speaker 3>like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2088
01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.500
<v Speaker 3>racketball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>handball,</v>

2089
01:32:14.501 --> 01:32:16.060
<v Speaker 3>things on those lines with that ball's</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming.</v>

2090
01:32:16.061 --> 01:32:19.870
<v Speaker 3>You don't know where it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to really anticipate what's</v>

2091
01:32:19.871 --> 01:32:20.870
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2092
01:32:20.970 --> 01:32:22.690
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine tennis would be the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2093
01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:26.490
<v Speaker 3>Like because your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your hand eye coordination involved with</v>

2094
01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.530
<v Speaker 3>fast motion calculations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the spin of the ball,</v>

2095
01:32:29.531 --> 01:32:33.820
<v Speaker 3>the ball's bouncing here goes a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>different things you have to sort of</v>

2096
01:32:33.821 --> 01:32:36.850
<v Speaker 3>trick your mind into getting engaged</v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

2097
01:32:38.130 --> 01:32:39.250
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that.</v>

2098
01:32:39.251 --> 01:32:41.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2099
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:44.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know like what Causes</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alzheimer's?</v>

2100
01:32:44.891 --> 01:32:46.300
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the cause of it?</v>

2101
01:32:46.301 --> 01:32:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Is it just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a genetic issue,</v>

2102
01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:49.240
<v Speaker 3>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Believe so.</v>

2103
01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:52.900
<v Speaker 3>I believe it's the people who have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>genetic propensity for it.</v>

2104
01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:56.480
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if people that just do like</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people get old and they're just in</v>

2105
01:32:56.481 --> 01:32:59.650
<v Speaker 3>their recliner all fucking day long and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's watching the same shit.</v>

2106
01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:02.470
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not challenging yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

2107
01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:05.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that factors in at all.</v>

2108
01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:08.530
<v Speaker 3>I think it certainly could factor in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people that have it,</v>

2109
01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:10.370
<v Speaker 3>it is a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2110
01:33:11.110 --> 01:33:15.460
<v Speaker 3>people that I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who's girlfriend's dad</v>

2111
01:33:15.461 --> 01:33:19.660
<v Speaker 3>has it and they have to go visit and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

2112
01:33:19.930 --> 01:33:21.730
<v Speaker 3>he's just barely there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just,</v>

2113
01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:27.180
<v Speaker 3>he's completely out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was an interesting podcast,</v>

2114
01:33:27.490 --> 01:33:30.490
<v Speaker 3>I think it was radio lab where they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about they were trying to</v>

2115
01:33:30.491 --> 01:33:33.760
<v Speaker 3>repopulate the whooping crane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whipping cream was like in danger of</v>

2116
01:33:33.761 --> 01:33:36.760
<v Speaker 3>extinction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that they had done</v>

2117
01:33:36.761 --> 01:33:41.230
<v Speaker 3>was they tried to come up with new</v>
<v Speaker 3>migration paths for these animals.</v>

2118
01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:44.020
<v Speaker 3>I think I read something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2119
01:33:44.021 --> 01:33:48.040
<v Speaker 3>this lady had a bird feeders in her yard</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's whooping cranes,</v>

2120
01:33:48.041 --> 01:33:52.750
<v Speaker 3>had come to her yard to use the bird</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeders and you know,</v>

2121
01:33:52.751 --> 01:33:56.950
<v Speaker 3>they were setting up these bird feeders</v>
<v Speaker 3>and interacting with them and the</v>

2122
01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:01.980
<v Speaker 3>scientists that had spent so much money</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so much time trying to engage these</v>

2123
01:34:02.771 --> 01:34:05.590
<v Speaker 3>whooping cranes into forming these new</v>
<v Speaker 3>migration pass.</v>

2124
01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:07.660
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to get her to stop doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2125
01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:11.530
<v Speaker 3>trying to get her to stop feeding the</v>
<v Speaker 3>birds because these birds,</v>

2126
01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:12.430
<v Speaker 3>they will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want them.</v>

2127
01:34:12.490 --> 01:34:15.160
<v Speaker 3>They want them to be wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want them to rely on people.</v>

2128
01:34:15.161 --> 01:34:19.180
<v Speaker 3>And also because these patterns were</v>
<v Speaker 3>predictable,</v>

2129
01:34:19.210 --> 01:34:20.600
<v Speaker 3>people would find them in the people</v>
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>

2130
01:34:20.710 --> 01:34:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Some people were shooting the whooping</v>
<v Speaker 3>cranes and should.</v>

2131
01:34:22.561 --> 01:34:26.680
<v Speaker 3>They had lost a few of them and it's bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking ungodly amounts of money trying</v>

2132
01:34:26.681 --> 01:34:31.360
<v Speaker 3>to repopulate these birds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but her husband had Alzheimer's like</v>

2133
01:34:31.361 --> 01:34:35.320
<v Speaker 3>real bad and the only thing that would</v>
<v Speaker 3>get them excited was birds.</v>

2134
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:38.790
<v Speaker 3>So he would be out there with her and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>would see the birds.</v>

2135
01:34:38.791 --> 01:34:39.640
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd all look,</v>

2136
01:34:39.641 --> 01:34:40.660
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there he is right there.</v>

2137
01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:43.720
<v Speaker 3>And she said like for that brief moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while these birds were there,</v>

2138
01:34:43.721 --> 01:34:46.900
<v Speaker 3>he would be back and she'd be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>engage them and talk to them,</v>

2139
01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:50.260
<v Speaker 3>but when the birds were gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just drifted away right back.</v>

2140
01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.150
<v Speaker 3>And he was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so she was like,</v>

2141
01:34:52.151 --> 01:34:54.340
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hanging out with my husband with the</v>

2142
01:34:54.341 --> 01:34:56.020
<v Speaker 3>birds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was weird,</v>

2143
01:34:56.021 --> 01:34:56.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty.</v>

2144
01:34:57.020 --> 01:34:57.853
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2145
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:59.810
<v Speaker 1>It's actually kind of incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2146
01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:02.420
<v Speaker 1>I remember like when my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before he died,</v>

2147
01:35:02.421 --> 01:35:04.450
<v Speaker 1>this real fun story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my head,</v>

2148
01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:06.220
<v Speaker 1>my mom was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2149
01:35:06.230 --> 01:35:07.970
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were frustrated with each other.</v>

2150
01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:10.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just riddled with cancer.</v>

2151
01:35:10.881 --> 01:35:13.730
<v Speaker 1>She's trying to help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's pissed and they never fought.</v>

2152
01:35:13.731 --> 01:35:16.490
<v Speaker 1>They never ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was weird to see them that way.</v>

2153
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:19.580
<v Speaker 1>But then if somebody came that he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2154
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:24.140
<v Speaker 1>he would come back like it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a new person.</v>

2155
01:35:24.470 --> 01:35:25.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2156
01:35:25.761 --> 01:35:28.010
<v Speaker 1>like as soon as somebody brand new came</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2157
01:35:28.011 --> 01:35:30.080
<v Speaker 1>like if it was a nurse or somebody that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't know,</v>

2158
01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I would watch him just immediately come</v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

2159
01:35:33.381 --> 01:35:36.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I don't know if he was trying to be</v>

2160
01:35:36.411 --> 01:35:38.660
<v Speaker 1>more hospitable or if it was like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2161
01:35:38.661 --> 01:35:43.100
<v Speaker 1>but just you would watch them just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could just switch and he would be</v>

2162
01:35:43.101 --> 01:35:43.450
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

2163
01:35:43.450 --> 01:35:46.420
<v Speaker 3>Well I think novelty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new things,</v>

2164
01:35:46.421 --> 01:35:48.790
<v Speaker 3>new new experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new places,</v>

2165
01:35:48.791 --> 01:35:52.690
<v Speaker 3>all those things stimulate areas of our</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain that we kind of take for granted.</v>

2166
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:56.530
<v Speaker 3>Like I like doing things that I suck at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the things that I really</v>

2167
01:35:56.531 --> 01:35:59.090
<v Speaker 3>liked doing or like doing things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not good at it.</v>

2168
01:35:59.100 --> 01:36:01.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm new at them and because because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>new at,</v>

2169
01:36:01.531 --> 01:36:04.490
<v Speaker 3>am I getting obsessed with it like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be good at,</v>

2170
01:36:05.310 --> 01:36:09.430
<v Speaker 3>but you're probably competitive to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fault of issues.</v>

2171
01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:14.380
<v Speaker 3>I'll be sweating at a board game or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2172
01:36:14.381 --> 01:36:17.980
<v Speaker 3>Like just probably why it was real bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was young.</v>

2173
01:36:17.981 --> 01:36:21.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm way better at it now way better</v>
<v Speaker 3>because now I understand what it is.</v>

2174
01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Back then I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just would be overwhelmed by the demon</v>

2175
01:36:24.970 --> 01:36:27.440
<v Speaker 3>and I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just needed to win,</v>

2176
01:36:27.700 --> 01:36:29.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find a way to win.</v>

2177
01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:31.690
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm just new things,</v>

2178
01:36:31.691 --> 01:36:32.840
<v Speaker 3>like even things that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>competitive.</v>

2179
01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:37.640
<v Speaker 3>Well I guess archery can be competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just do it like sort of as</v>

2180
01:36:37.690 --> 01:36:39.410
<v Speaker 3>practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I'm obsessed with it.</v>

2181
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:43.990
<v Speaker 3>I fucking it just because I suck at it</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason.</v>

2182
01:36:43.991 --> 01:36:48.760
<v Speaker 3>Like when I'm practicing it's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes my entire focus and these new</v>

2183
01:36:48.761 --> 01:36:50.650
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Yoga is another thing.</v>

2184
01:36:50.651 --> 01:36:53.760
<v Speaker 3>I fucking suck at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was doing it.</v>

2185
01:36:53.770 --> 01:36:55.330
<v Speaker 3>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come you can't do it?</v>

2186
01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:58.180
<v Speaker 3>You only tried it once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not flexible.</v>

2187
01:36:58.450 --> 01:37:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Well that's because you got to stretch</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>

2188
01:37:00.131 --> 01:37:02.770
<v Speaker 3>Kind of logic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I suck.</v>

2189
01:37:02.771 --> 01:37:06.370
<v Speaker 3>That's like saying yeah I tried playing</v>
<v Speaker 3>football but I'm not good at it.</v>

2190
01:37:06.371 --> 01:37:08.500
<v Speaker 3>But try to move around a lot more.</v>

2191
01:37:09.150 --> 01:37:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you go really wasn't I</v>

2192
01:37:11.191 --> 01:37:12.930
<v Speaker 1>like feeling like I'm doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to go jog,</v>

2193
01:37:12.931 --> 01:37:13.651
<v Speaker 1>I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2194
01:37:13.651 --> 01:37:15.840
<v Speaker 1>like that's not enough moving about.</v>

2195
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:18.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's part of the whole practice</v>

2196
01:37:18.141 --> 01:37:22.460
<v Speaker 3>of it is practice being still holding</v>
<v Speaker 3>poses.</v>

2197
01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:25.390
<v Speaker 3>My point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my point is I'm not good at it but.</v>

2198
01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.650
<v Speaker 3>So I'm obsessed with it so when I do it</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2199
01:37:27.651 --> 01:37:31.260
<v Speaker 3>it just becomes like this overwhelming</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing for me.</v>

2200
01:37:31.261 --> 01:37:34.610
<v Speaker 3>But I concentrate on it all the time and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do it a couple days a week and for</v>

2201
01:37:34.611 --> 01:37:37.040
<v Speaker 3>the other days that I'm not doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about it a lot of time.</v>

2202
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:39.890
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why I like,</v>

2203
01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:42.740
<v Speaker 1>well I kind of stand up those up for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2204
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Stand up really does that for me because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

2205
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I always get a little nervous before a</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

2206
01:37:46.401 --> 01:37:49.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you and if it works,</v>

2207
01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:51.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if it doesn't you figure out what</v>

2208
01:37:51.591 --> 01:37:53.200
<v Speaker 1>joke didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it did,</v>

2209
01:37:53.210 --> 01:37:54.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should scrap it,</v>

2210
01:37:55.080 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 1>change it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I.</v>

2211
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:56.791
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2212
01:37:56.791 --> 01:38:00.180
<v Speaker 2>that's one thing I really love about</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup is it does like Jeremy,</v>

2213
01:38:00.210 --> 01:38:02.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes me like,</v>

2214
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:05.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how you feel when you get off stage</v>

2215
01:38:05.041 --> 01:38:07.860
<v Speaker 2>and you're like all psyched up and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I love that feeling of being</v>

2216
01:38:07.861 --> 01:38:11.430
<v Speaker 2>nervous and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>onstage and that always is very like</v>

2217
01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:14.490
<v Speaker 2>rewarding to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stand was one of the few things is still</v>

2218
01:38:14.491 --> 01:38:16.950
<v Speaker 2>challenging in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these years later,</v>

2219
01:38:16.951 --> 01:38:20.640
<v Speaker 2>26 plus years later for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also because I write new stuff.</v>

2220
01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:23.310
<v Speaker 2>That's the key is practicing new</v>
<v Speaker 2>material,</v>

2221
01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.400
<v Speaker 2>having new material,</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly writing.</v>

2222
01:38:26.430 --> 01:38:30.300
<v Speaker 2>If you don't do that then you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>trapped and if you get trapped with an</v>

2223
01:38:30.301 --> 01:38:34.650
<v Speaker 2>act like we all know those older comics</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have been around for 50 fucking</v>

2224
01:38:34.651 --> 01:38:37.290
<v Speaker 2>years or whatever and they have that act</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're doing like Reagan</v>

2225
01:38:37.291 --> 01:38:38.620
<v Speaker 2>impressions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoke issues,</v>

2226
01:38:39.810 --> 01:38:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Claritin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>claritin.</v>

2227
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:42.870
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't kicked in yet.</v>

2228
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:45.090
<v Speaker 2>I took it on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way here are alerted to anything</v>

2229
01:38:45.091 --> 01:38:45.751
<v Speaker 2>else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cats,</v>

2230
01:38:45.751 --> 01:38:46.590
<v Speaker 2>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheese,</v>

2231
01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:47.540
<v Speaker 2>milk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

2232
01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:50.140
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just flying through the air.</v>

2233
01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:51.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

2234
01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:52.711
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2235
01:38:52.711 --> 01:38:54.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like a Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time it rains,</v>

2236
01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:57.320
<v Speaker 2>that's when it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's whatever's kicked up like</v>

2237
01:38:57.330 --> 01:39:01.620
<v Speaker 2>ragweed pollen is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's seasonal times a year.</v>

2238
01:39:01.930 --> 01:39:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you get it in Houston as well?</v>

2239
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just different times a year in Houston</v>

2240
01:39:06.450 --> 01:39:08.520
<v Speaker 2>is different out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've actually had a worse out here,</v>

2241
01:39:08.521 --> 01:39:09.354
<v Speaker 2>which is weird.</v>

2242
01:39:10.810 --> 01:39:12.100
<v Speaker 2>That is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2243
01:39:12.101 --> 01:39:15.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's the climate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was in a really humid climate.</v>

2244
01:39:15.911 --> 01:39:18.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there's just something</v>
<v Speaker 2>else maybe that I'm allergic to that I</v>

2245
01:39:18.731 --> 01:39:21.400
<v Speaker 2>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've noticed that because my eyes</v>

2246
01:39:21.401 --> 01:39:22.660
<v Speaker 2>get a little burn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2247
01:39:22.661 --> 01:39:24.490
<v Speaker 2>and I'll get like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2248
01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:28.000
<v Speaker 2>that just real bread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could feel like everything's draining.</v>

2249
01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:31.660
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people move to like dry desert climates</v>

2250
01:39:31.661 --> 01:39:34.240
<v Speaker 2>like Arizona to try to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe me,</v>

2251
01:39:34.241 --> 01:39:35.140
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

2252
01:39:35.141 --> 01:39:38.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's been worse since I've been in</v>

2253
01:39:38.591 --> 01:39:41.080
<v Speaker 2>La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Houston in the summer is one of the</v>

2254
01:39:41.081 --> 01:39:42.490
<v Speaker 2>most bizarre environments.</v>

2255
01:39:44.530 --> 01:39:46.920
<v Speaker 2>You're just breathing water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He like,</v>

2256
01:39:47.230 --> 01:39:48.190
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's just.</v>

2257
01:39:48.191 --> 01:39:49.100
<v Speaker 2>It's wet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2258
01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:50.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really feel like you could drain your</v>

2259
01:39:51.070 --> 01:39:55.600
<v Speaker 2>100 degrees and 100 percent humidity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just the windows outside.</v>

2260
01:39:55.601 --> 01:39:56.800
<v Speaker 2>You Walk Up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wearing sunglasses,</v>

2261
01:39:56.801 --> 01:39:59.860
<v Speaker 2>they fog up and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your your sunglasses fog up,</v>

2262
01:39:59.861 --> 01:40:02.110
<v Speaker 2>your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your clothes instantly stick to you.</v>

2263
01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:05.740
<v Speaker 2>Like to concerts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll start filming a flimsy.</v>

2264
01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:07.890
<v Speaker 2>It could be at one of those like stiff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2265
01:40:07.900 --> 01:40:09.760
<v Speaker 2>t shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden it's real flimsy.</v>

2266
01:40:09.780 --> 01:40:14.110
<v Speaker 2>It stuck to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really good for your skin.</v>

2267
01:40:14.980 --> 01:40:15.813
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2268
01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Chicks to young looking for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

2269
01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Just stay where they're moist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Facially</v>

2270
01:40:24.490 --> 01:40:28.640
<v Speaker 2>skin was don't mean the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moist.</v>

2271
01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your facial skin stays moist.</v>

2272
01:40:33.850 --> 01:40:34.870
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My line,</v>

2273
01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:36.580
<v Speaker 2>my bacon things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use lotion.</v>

2274
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:37.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that helps too.</v>

2275
01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good move.</v>

2276
01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:39.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do that,</v>

2277
01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:41.950
<v Speaker 2>but I think that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the environment,</v>

2278
01:40:41.951 --> 01:40:44.830
<v Speaker 2>like the dry air environment is bad for</v>
<v Speaker 2>your skin.</v>

2279
01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:50.480
<v Speaker 2>It definitely is because I know like</v>
<v Speaker 2>when those moments during the summertime</v>

2280
01:40:50.481 --> 01:40:54.190
<v Speaker 2>out here when it's just fucking that</v>
<v Speaker 2>just gnarly heat,</v>

2281
01:40:54.191 --> 01:40:57.250
<v Speaker 2>that desert heat heat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2282
01:40:57.251 --> 01:40:59.950
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my skin is like drinking the lotion that</v>

2283
01:40:59.951 --> 01:41:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I've put on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like how my skin already dried out</v>

2284
01:41:03.401 --> 01:41:03.971
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2285
01:41:03.971 --> 01:41:06.490
<v Speaker 2>like you're just sitting there just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty,</v>

2286
01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:08.193
<v Speaker 2>pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Fun.</v>

2287
01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:10.840
<v Speaker 2>But I like it out here better.</v>

2288
01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:14.250
<v Speaker 3>What do you like about here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But more open minded more.</v>

2289
01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:14.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

2290
01:41:14.970 --> 01:41:15.803
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>

2291
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:16.663
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2292
01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:20.040
<v Speaker 2>I like doing all the standup stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing and it's different because I</v>

2293
01:41:20.041 --> 01:41:21.050
<v Speaker 2>moved out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2294
01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:24.480
<v Speaker 2>Career wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I love my career so that makes it,</v>

2295
01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:25.510
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2296
01:41:25.510 --> 01:41:27.660
<v Speaker 2>And plus the weather's usually always</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice out here.</v>

2297
01:41:27.930 --> 01:41:30.720
<v Speaker 2>I liked the beaches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to surf.</v>

2298
01:41:30.721 --> 01:41:32.460
<v Speaker 2>I like to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2299
01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.560
<v Speaker 2>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two things I don't like out</v>

2300
01:41:34.561 --> 01:41:35.460
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

2301
01:41:35.461 --> 01:41:36.880
<v Speaker 2>the overpopulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2302
01:41:36.930 --> 01:41:38.550
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculously over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Traffic sucks.</v>

2303
01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:42.870
<v Speaker 2>Traffic sucks that stuff and to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>

2304
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

2305
01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:46.650
<v Speaker 2>she's</v>

2306
01:41:46.650 --> 01:41:48.090
<v Speaker 3>tucking away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2307
01:41:48.091 --> 01:41:50.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like throwing all my fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>tissues.</v>

2308
01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:55.320
<v Speaker 3>It's really impressive that the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other thing is there's this</v>

2309
01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:58.050
<v Speaker 3>disingenuous aspect of the entertainment</v>
<v Speaker 3>industry.</v>

2310
01:41:58.320 --> 01:42:01.620
<v Speaker 3>This is shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird sort of actor.</v>

2311
01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:05.820
<v Speaker 3>He thing that I think is a product of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people having to audition.</v>

2312
01:42:06.090 --> 01:42:08.910
<v Speaker 3>So you're constantly having to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to like you,</v>

2313
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.500
<v Speaker 3>so you put on this sort of fake behavior</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you become a part of whatever</v>

2314
01:42:13.501 --> 01:42:18.450
<v Speaker 3>click or whatever pattern that you think</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like in the vogue in popular,</v>

2315
01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:20.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how many people called Caitlyn</v>

2316
01:42:20.850 --> 01:42:22.690
<v Speaker 3>Jenner a hero and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's,</v>

2317
01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:23.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in,</v>

2318
01:42:23.851 --> 01:42:26.240
<v Speaker 3>you're in with the right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the right sensibilities to.</v>

2319
01:42:26.241 --> 01:42:27.074
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2320
01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:29.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even on your head,</v>

2321
01:42:29.071 --> 01:42:31.200
<v Speaker 3>you could be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Kony 2012.</v>

2322
01:42:31.201 --> 01:42:36.201
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was like this fucking Kony</v>
<v Speaker 3>2012 where everybody fucking jumped on</v>

2323
01:42:36.241 --> 01:42:36.691
<v Speaker 3>board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2324
01:42:36.691 --> 01:42:39.960
<v Speaker 3>do you even know what the fuck you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bumper sticker for?</v>

2325
01:42:39.961 --> 01:42:42.960
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still Hashtag that Kony 2012,</v>

2326
01:42:42.961 --> 01:42:45.840
<v Speaker 3>but I'll do it on something that makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely no sense.</v>

2327
01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:49.500
<v Speaker 3>It's just about World Dick joke and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>always put Kony 2012.</v>

2328
01:42:52.130 --> 01:42:53.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to let it die,</v>

2329
01:42:53.661 --> 01:42:56.520
<v Speaker 3>but it's going to keep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it to stay relevant.</v>

2330
01:42:56.521 --> 01:42:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Kony 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one of my favorite all time human</v>

2331
01:42:59.521 --> 01:43:01.710
<v Speaker 3>folly stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the guy who started that whole</v>

2332
01:43:01.711 --> 01:43:03.330
<v Speaker 3>movement meltdown he had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2333
01:43:03.331 --> 01:43:05.460
<v Speaker 3>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so good.</v>

2334
01:43:05.461 --> 01:43:08.060
<v Speaker 3>That was true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was true meltdowns.</v>

2335
01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:13.820
<v Speaker 3>I think he was probably completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane before he started the pressure of</v>

2336
01:43:14.131 --> 01:43:17.730
<v Speaker 3>the success of the movement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like somehow or another this guy got</v>

2337
01:43:17.731 --> 01:43:22.470
<v Speaker 3>celebrities and all these world famous</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were on board because it became</v>

2338
01:43:22.500 --> 01:43:24.630
<v Speaker 3>the cause detour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2339
01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:28.260
<v Speaker 3>it was the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the flavor of the month.</v>

2340
01:43:28.261 --> 01:43:32.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean he like how long did it last?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm trying to think quite a while.</v>

2341
01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:33.690
<v Speaker 3>Six months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe six.</v>

2342
01:43:33.691 --> 01:43:34.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>

2343
01:43:35.010 --> 01:43:36.690
<v Speaker 3>But it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:43:36.691 --> 01:43:39.210
<v Speaker 3>Every celebrity was on board wearing</v>
<v Speaker 3>their tee shirt.</v>

2345
01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Kony 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So many bumper stickers.</v>

2346
01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:46.050
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day jerking off in front of people</v>

2347
01:43:46.260 --> 01:43:49.070
<v Speaker 3>running around the street with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>pants down screen.</v>

2348
01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 3>Completely naked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just on a corner.</v>

2349
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:54.230
<v Speaker 2>And I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Kony 2012.</v>

2350
01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Don't forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't forget.</v>

2351
01:43:55.971 --> 01:43:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Blessed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blessed.</v>

2352
01:43:58.010 --> 01:44:00.580
<v Speaker 2>And it ended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It ended like that.</v>

2353
01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all it took.</v>

2354
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:05.390
<v Speaker 2>It was like people talked a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the meltdown and then it was like</v>

2355
01:44:05.391 --> 01:44:08.720
<v Speaker 2>something else happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We never heard like who knows what that</v>

2356
01:44:08.721 --> 01:44:12.590
<v Speaker 2>guy's doing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to me that embodies the disingenuous</v>

2357
01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:16.610
<v Speaker 2>aspect of a lot of the Hollywood like</v>
<v Speaker 2>activism type behavior.</v>

2358
01:44:16.611 --> 01:44:19.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like I don't necessarily think</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really interested in the</v>

2359
01:44:19.821 --> 01:44:22.850
<v Speaker 2>activism as much as they're interested</v>
<v Speaker 2>in people thinking they're interested in</v>

2360
01:44:22.851 --> 01:44:25.880
<v Speaker 2>the activism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to put together a</v>

2361
01:44:25.881 --> 01:44:27.170
<v Speaker 2>package,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2362
01:44:27.171 --> 01:44:29.060
<v Speaker 2>and that package is how you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you dress,</v>

2363
01:44:29.061 --> 01:44:29.894
<v Speaker 2>how you act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you behave,</v>

2364
01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:32.750
<v Speaker 2>and you have to have liberal</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensibilities because you want to be</v>

2365
01:44:32.751 --> 01:44:36.110
<v Speaker 2>fucking cast so you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to connect with these people</v>

2366
01:44:36.111 --> 01:44:37.160
<v Speaker 2>that have the casting agents.</v>

2367
01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:40.400
<v Speaker 2>You can't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't be outrageous in,</v>

2368
01:44:40.410 --> 01:44:43.320
<v Speaker 2>in any way that's non.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

2369
01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:47.840
<v Speaker 2>don't know if you say you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's that says Rob Schneider.</v>

2370
01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Somebody said he was a republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was he,</v>

2371
01:44:50.230 --> 01:44:53.030
<v Speaker 2>I think he said it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just lays up fucking vaccine</v>

2372
01:44:53.031 --> 01:44:54.710
<v Speaker 2>denier and he's carrying a lot of weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2373
01:44:55.330 --> 01:44:57.170
<v Speaker 2>But it's like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not liberal,</v>

2374
01:44:57.171 --> 01:44:59.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like kind of I guess the vaccine.</v>

2375
01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:02.290
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of vaccine deniers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really liberal,</v>

2376
01:45:02.690 --> 01:45:05.780
<v Speaker 2>but it's such a weird thing that if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something that's not the norm out</v>

2377
01:45:05.781 --> 01:45:07.280
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone just treats you like a bag of</v>

2378
01:45:07.281 --> 01:45:09.750
<v Speaker 2>shit and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2379
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:12.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like I don't have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem because I'm not an actor.</v>

2380
01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:17.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm a writer and I do stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also I don't know if it's because I</v>

2381
01:45:17.121 --> 01:45:22.070
<v Speaker 2>moved out here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 37 so I didn't move out here at 19</v>

2382
01:45:22.071 --> 01:45:25.230
<v Speaker 2>starry eyed with five roommates and</v>
<v Speaker 2>inefficiency,</v>

2383
01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:27.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm super vulnerable to other</v>

2384
01:45:27.891 --> 01:45:28.440
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

2385
01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.690
<v Speaker 2>I've been working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a stock portfolio.</v>

2386
01:45:30.691 --> 01:45:35.691
<v Speaker 2>I bought a house so I didn't really give</v>
<v Speaker 2>a shit the way that I think that if you</v>

2387
01:45:35.811 --> 01:45:38.690
<v Speaker 2>come out here so early you're totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>affected by it.</v>

2388
01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I've met a lot of people that were</v>

2389
01:45:41.181 --> 01:45:44.270
<v Speaker 2>really young when they came out here and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met them young when they were out</v>

2390
01:45:44.271 --> 01:45:46.310
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I did a show once back in the day</v>

2391
01:45:46.311 --> 01:45:50.930
<v Speaker 2>with this guy who was an actor and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like 22 and he was this handsome guy</v>

2392
01:45:51.140 --> 01:45:55.640
<v Speaker 2>and he was trying so hard to fucking be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the that God,</v>

2393
01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:57.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we were talking about.</v>

2394
01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that Jack Nicholson</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie with um,</v>

2395
01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Helen Hunt thing is called as good as it</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets?</v>

2396
01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:06.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking hated that movie.</v>

2397
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:10.530
<v Speaker 2>I hated that movie with every fiber of</v>
<v Speaker 2>my being and one of the reasons why I</v>

2398
01:46:10.531 --> 01:46:14.480
<v Speaker 2>hated it because I felt sad that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman who's a single mom and she seemed</v>

2399
01:46:14.481 --> 01:46:18.740
<v Speaker 2>really nice and Jack Nicholson's a piece</v>
<v Speaker 2>of shit and asshole and she's stuck with</v>

2400
01:46:18.741 --> 01:46:20.600
<v Speaker 2>them and this is as good as you get.</v>

2401
01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:24.470
<v Speaker 2>That was the whole idea of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this is fucking ridiculous idea</v>

2402
01:46:24.471 --> 01:46:27.080
<v Speaker 2>that he was racist because he needed</v>
<v Speaker 2>medication.</v>

2403
01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.480
<v Speaker 2>So they gave him medication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He stopped being racist,</v>

2404
01:46:29.481 --> 01:46:32.210
<v Speaker 2>like what the fuck kind of movie is I</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess grows.</v>

2405
01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:35.690
<v Speaker 2>And so he and I were having this</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation because it was the movie</v>

2406
01:46:35.691 --> 01:46:37.600
<v Speaker 2>that everybody enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone did she,</v>

2407
01:46:38.230 --> 01:46:39.320
<v Speaker 2>it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2408
01:46:39.321 --> 01:46:43.010
<v Speaker 2>She wanted an Oscar for it and so he and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I were having this conversation.</v>

2409
01:46:43.011 --> 01:46:47.240
<v Speaker 2>He was doing that thing that they do</v>
<v Speaker 2>where if it is something that everybody</v>

2410
01:46:47.241 --> 01:46:49.010
<v Speaker 2>likes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he likes it and,</v>

2411
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:51.030
<v Speaker 2>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking hated that movie.</v>

2412
01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:51.930
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

2413
01:46:52.350 --> 01:46:53.760
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing movie.</v>

2414
01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:54.810
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is amazing.</v>

2415
01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:56.560
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is cheese?</v>

2416
01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:59.400
<v Speaker 2>This poor woman was this kid and he says</v>
<v Speaker 2>old cut.</v>

2417
01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:03.090
<v Speaker 2>And she stuck with them and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting any better.</v>

2418
01:47:03.090 --> 01:47:04.950
<v Speaker 2>So she'd rather sickly kid be around</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2419
01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Creepy dude with sunglasses on.</v>

2420
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.050
<v Speaker 2>So he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

2421
01:47:10.051 --> 01:47:11.820
<v Speaker 2>I thought he had a lot to offer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2422
01:47:11.821 --> 01:47:13.020
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you just say?</v>

2423
01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:15.300
<v Speaker 2>He had a lot to offer what but</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathing.</v>

2424
01:47:15.301 --> 01:47:18.260
<v Speaker 2>He's my hanging around her money and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't what it that mean?</v>

2425
01:47:18.730 --> 01:47:20.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2426
01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:22.830
<v Speaker 2>the purpose of that movie was</v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusting,</v>

2427
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:25.650
<v Speaker 2>but when I had this conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 2>him about it,</v>

2428
01:47:25.651 --> 01:47:29.940
<v Speaker 2>it became clear really early on when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>started chipping away at it,</v>

2429
01:47:29.941 --> 01:47:32.600
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it that got you about the movie</v>

2430
01:47:32.601 --> 01:47:33.730
<v Speaker 2>where it would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

2431
01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:35.520
<v Speaker 2>would go well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but got him.</v>

2432
01:47:35.521 --> 01:47:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Is it everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was saying they liked it,</v>

2433
01:47:37.380 --> 01:47:39.660
<v Speaker 2>everybody said they liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you wanted to say he liked it.</v>

2434
01:47:39.661 --> 01:47:42.990
<v Speaker 2>So he was just wracking his brain for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that one thing that person said</v>

2435
01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:43.530
<v Speaker 2>about it?</v>

2436
01:47:43.530 --> 01:47:45.960
<v Speaker 2>He's an interesting case because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got real,</v>

2437
01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:48.960
<v Speaker 2>real hot real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people were really into them.</v>

2438
01:47:48.961 --> 01:47:51.990
<v Speaker 2>But then they found out he was Kinda</v>
<v Speaker 2>dumb and it just drifted away.</v>

2439
01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:54.960
<v Speaker 2>It just ended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I thought that was okay in Hollywood</v>

2440
01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:58.220
<v Speaker 2>you can only be so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was real super dumb.</v>

2441
01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:02.310
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that they get</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a little bit of juice in the</v>

2442
01:48:02.311 --> 01:48:04.950
<v Speaker 2>beginning and like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really starting to happen,</v>

2443
01:48:05.090 --> 01:48:07.320
<v Speaker 2>should I not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the juice cuts off.</v>

2444
01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then some new one with maybe better</v>

2445
01:48:09.781 --> 01:48:12.200
<v Speaker 2>cheeks or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody has their moments and</v>

2446
01:48:12.201 --> 01:48:16.200
<v Speaker 2>getting hot and then cold and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hope if you get cold you get hot,</v>

2447
01:48:16.201 --> 01:48:18.420
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2448
01:48:18.421 --> 01:48:22.410
<v Speaker 2>But</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really fucking stupid.</v>

2449
01:48:22.411 --> 01:48:25.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like during that whole Chris Brown</v>

2450
01:48:25.231 --> 01:48:27.680
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's my only like examples.</v>

2451
01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Of course I was getting invited to be on</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows and talk about it and I declined</v>

2452
01:48:32.790 --> 01:48:33.330
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2453
01:48:33.330 --> 01:48:34.320
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2454
01:48:34.321 --> 01:48:35.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2455
01:48:35.851 --> 01:48:37.620
<v Speaker 2>absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't the Chris Brown things.</v>

2456
01:48:37.650 --> 01:48:41.730
<v Speaker 2>We talked about it before the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if people don't know Chris Brown</v>

2457
01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:46.680
<v Speaker 2>obviously was in trouble because of beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>up or Yana and that whole thing and you</v>

2458
01:48:46.681 --> 01:48:49.560
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the domestic violence issue and you</v>

2459
01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:51.960
<v Speaker 2>tweeted something at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you tweet?</v>

2460
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like my lowest form of comedy.</v>

2461
01:48:55.381 --> 01:48:58.890
<v Speaker 2>Writing is the celebrity reach weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because I can't think of anything</v>

2462
01:48:58.891 --> 01:49:03.891
<v Speaker 2>else and I'll just go to my favorite</v>
<v Speaker 2>targets like camera Kim Kardashians and</v>

2463
01:49:04.081 --> 01:49:06.000
<v Speaker 2>I only make fun of when they write</v>
<v Speaker 2>something stupid.</v>

2464
01:49:06.001 --> 01:49:07.500
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never ever,</v>

2465
01:49:07.501 --> 01:49:10.780
<v Speaker 2>like I've never talked about some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these looks their weight there,</v>

2466
01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:13.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's just something dumb.</v>

2467
01:49:13.530 --> 01:49:15.360
<v Speaker 2>And with his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what he did,</v>

2468
01:49:15.361 --> 01:49:18.630
<v Speaker 2>he's a horrible person and he had showed</v>
<v Speaker 2>no signs of remorse.</v>

2469
01:49:18.630 --> 01:49:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Like he kept doing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He threw a chair through the window and</v>

2470
01:49:22.291 --> 01:49:24.470
<v Speaker 2>good morning America and Robert and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert's interviews.</v>

2471
01:49:24.870 --> 01:49:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2472
01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:28.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean like asking him about it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently they had made some sort of an</v>

2473
01:49:28.771 --> 01:49:31.210
<v Speaker 2>agreement where they weren't going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring up with domestic violence.</v>

2474
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:34.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to talk about my album,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the whole thing is,</v>

2475
01:49:34.141 --> 01:49:37.530
<v Speaker 2>it's like how he channeled his rage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing a chair through a fucking</v>

2476
01:49:37.550 --> 01:49:42.550
<v Speaker 2>window really couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was born child and so I was born</v>

2477
01:49:43.231 --> 01:49:45.840
<v Speaker 2>and he had tweeted something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2478
01:49:45.841 --> 01:49:47.950
<v Speaker 2>I look old as fuck and I'm only 23.</v>

2479
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:51.400
<v Speaker 1>And so I retweeted it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know being a worthless piece of shit</v>

2480
01:49:51.401 --> 01:49:55.570
<v Speaker 1>can really age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was funny and then all of a</v>

2481
01:49:55.571 --> 01:50:00.571
<v Speaker 1>sudden like I look at my replies on my</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone and it will look like that</v>

2482
01:50:02.170 --> 01:50:04.930
<v Speaker 1>waterfall of just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden it was like a thousand</v>

2483
01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:05.830
<v Speaker 1>$2,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2484
01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoops.</v>

2485
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:10.570
<v Speaker 1>What did I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized he was coming back,</v>

2486
01:50:11.550 --> 01:50:14.230
<v Speaker 1>like Gino telling me to suck his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2487
01:50:14.231 --> 01:50:15.430
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mother must be so.</v>

2488
01:50:15.431 --> 01:50:16.870
<v Speaker 1>But like I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played with them.</v>

2489
01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:18.490
<v Speaker 1>It was a Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was bored.</v>

2490
01:50:18.491 --> 01:50:23.180
<v Speaker 1>And like next thing I know is like he</v>
<v Speaker 1>deleted his entire twitter account and</v>

2491
01:50:23.210 --> 01:50:26.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what I meant to say.</v>

2494
01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:37.960

<v Speaker 1>I think he was trying to sound smart</v>

<v Speaker 1>beam accuracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he have with his is even the back</v>

2524
01:51:55.211 --> 01:51:56.790
<v Speaker 1>How hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was laughing.</v>

2525
01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:00.640
<v Speaker 1>She was totally not promoting this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got some good ones I want you to</v>

<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2530
01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:06.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it because I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to.</v>

2531
01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:09.850
<v Speaker 1>That's not my intention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just so happened.</v>

2532
01:52:09.851 --> 01:52:12.400
<v Speaker 1>That's something that I thought he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't going to take.</v>

2533
01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:13.670
<v Speaker 1>They get pissed about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2534
01:52:13.710 --> 01:52:17.080
<v Speaker 1>that ended up being something and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't how I wanted to make my,</v>

2535
01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:18.670
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self known,</v>

2536
01:52:18.671 --> 01:52:19.504
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just,</v>

2537
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:21.370
<v Speaker 1>at that point I already had like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2538
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:23.650
<v Speaker 1>300,000 followers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like I didn't.</v>

2539
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just starting out and I was</v>

2540
01:52:26.051 --> 01:52:28.900
<v Speaker 1>trying to get fame or something off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2541
01:52:28.901 --> 01:52:33.100
<v Speaker 1>but you doing what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing what I do and it went</v>

2542
01:52:33.730 --> 01:52:37.540
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that I didn't ask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2543
01:52:37.541 --> 01:52:38.410
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2544
01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:39.340
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that.</v>

2545
01:52:39.341 --> 01:52:42.430
<v Speaker 1>And I think about it and like I wonder</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people would.</v>

2546
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Somebody said something one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did that bother you that that was when</v>

<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the low was be like dipping,</v>

2551
01:52:52.660 --> 01:52:53.780
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2552
01:52:53.781 --> 01:52:57.170
<v Speaker 1>it was not my finest hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not proud of that moment at all.</v>

2553
01:52:57.171 --> 01:52:58.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't regret it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>

2554
01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:02.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm certainly not going to go sit on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>show and talk about how wonderful I am.</v>

2555
01:53:03.070 --> 01:53:03.711
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2556
01:53:03.711 --> 01:53:06.620
<v Speaker 1>I look at what I wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called it like a fucking ignorant</v>

2557
01:53:06.621 --> 01:53:11.300
<v Speaker 1>fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Rosa parks.</v>

2558
01:53:11.330 --> 01:53:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Just something near like some heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like no,</v>

2559
01:53:14.151 --> 01:53:16.730
<v Speaker 1>he was a piece of shit and I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like acknowledging that.</v>

2560
01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

2561
01:53:18.530 --> 01:53:22.790
<v Speaker 1>I wish I knew what happened with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know he beat her and I know you should</v>

2562
01:53:22.791 --> 01:53:25.190
<v Speaker 1>never beat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't beat anybody.</v>

2563
01:53:25.370 --> 01:53:27.080
<v Speaker 1>You definitely shouldn't beat someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>you love.</v>

2564
01:53:27.110 --> 01:53:28.970
<v Speaker 1>You definitely shouldn't be the girl if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a guy.</v>

2565
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:31.300
<v Speaker 1>But I want to know what she did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2566
01:53:31.310 --> 01:53:32.750
<v Speaker 1>she might have punched him in the face</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2567
01:53:32.751 --> 01:53:34.410
<v Speaker 1>And he punched her back or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2568
01:53:34.420 --> 01:53:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean the whole police report is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2569
01:53:37.071 --> 01:53:39.440
<v Speaker 1>which he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he actually acknowledged at all was she</v>

2570
01:53:39.441 --> 01:53:43.040
<v Speaker 1>took his phone and there was another</v>
<v Speaker 1>chick texting and she was like,</v>

2571
01:53:43.041 --> 01:53:43.910
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2572
01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:46.730
<v Speaker 1>but they're driving and then he punched</v>
<v Speaker 1>her in the mouth and then just kept</v>

2573
01:53:46.731 --> 01:53:49.700
<v Speaker 1>punching or driving around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a 30 minute torture session.</v>

2574
01:53:49.701 --> 01:53:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2575
01:53:50.930 --> 01:53:55.580
<v Speaker 1>like he beat her head until it says and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dot whatever her actual last name is.</v>

2576
01:53:55.590 --> 01:53:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Her mouth filled with blood tooth</v>
<v Speaker 1>chipped a.</v>

2577
01:53:58.370 --> 01:54:01.190
<v Speaker 1>So he doesn't hit him at all now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't hit him at all.</v>

2578
01:54:01.191 --> 01:54:02.900
<v Speaker 1>She kept trying to get out of the car</v>
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>

2579
01:54:03.210 --> 01:54:06.260
<v Speaker 1>But then they break up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course she got a restraining order</v>

2580
01:54:06.261 --> 01:54:09.470
<v Speaker 1>and then when that ended she got back</v>
<v Speaker 1>together with him.</v>

2581
01:54:09.710 --> 01:54:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Probably give some good Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

2582
01:54:11.830 --> 01:54:14.150
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess</v>

2583
01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she forgave him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't,</v>

2584
01:54:19.131 --> 01:54:20.750
<v Speaker 1>maybe shouldn't have been fucking with</v>
<v Speaker 1>his phone.</v>

2585
01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Maybe she should have kept her hands</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they belong.</v>

2586
01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Not on his phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was such a like,</v>

2587
01:54:29.450 --> 01:54:31.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was such a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2588
01:54:31.630 --> 01:54:33.770
<v Speaker 1>when I started getting all I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2589
01:54:34.130 --> 01:54:36.260
<v Speaker 1>my mom is going to like read the shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I wrote.</v>

2590
01:54:36.570 --> 01:54:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I was more just going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was your daughter and that guy was</v>

2591
01:54:40.581 --> 01:54:43.940
<v Speaker 1>hitting your daughter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then just,</v>

2592
01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:45.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting back together with him.</v>

2593
01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2594
01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:50.310
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2595
01:54:50.690 --> 01:54:52.820
<v Speaker 1>who knows what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really luck or what she's really</v>

2596
01:54:52.821 --> 01:54:54.560
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's obviously a little crazy too.</v>

2597
01:54:54.650 --> 01:54:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she'd have to be like a little.</v>

2598
01:54:58.380 --> 01:55:00.770
<v Speaker 1>But I think people that are that</v>
<v Speaker 1>talented are just fucking crazy.</v>

2599
01:55:00.770 --> 01:55:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember her,</v>

2600
01:55:03.261 --> 01:55:04.400
<v Speaker 1>who's talented?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her.</v>

2601
01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:06.230
<v Speaker 1>She's very talented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her voice.</v>

2602
01:55:06.710 --> 01:55:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of people can say you don't</v>

2603
01:55:08.781 --> 01:55:11.060
<v Speaker 1>think she's talented?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2604
01:55:11.061 --> 01:55:13.880
<v Speaker 1>it's just because I think she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she saw him for getting back together</v>

2605
01:55:13.970 --> 01:55:14.391
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2606
01:55:14.391 --> 01:55:16.130
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a hard time getting past that.</v>

2607
01:55:16.131 --> 01:55:18.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't even listen to new music</v>

2608
01:55:18.471 --> 01:55:19.000
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2609
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.900
<v Speaker 1>sit down with an old person driving</v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

2610
01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:24.340
<v Speaker 1>listening to lithium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serious.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's probably it.</v>

2614

<v Speaker 1>I listened to that eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties first wave.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

2617
01:55:38.770 --> 01:55:40.820
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really care for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think about it?</v>

2618

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:04.500
<v Speaker 3>I was out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't finish it actually because</v>

2629
01:56:04.501 --> 01:56:06.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't watch bad acting.</v>

2630
01:56:06.811 --> 01:56:11.811
<v Speaker 3>Like I thought it was a documentary and</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'm watching actors pretend to be and</v>

2631
01:56:12.571 --> 01:56:14.550
<v Speaker 3>it's somebody else's version of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2632
01:56:14.551 --> 01:56:15.630
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it felt</v>

2633
01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:18.353
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2634
01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:20.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you in that sense.</v>

2635
01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:23.760
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think they had rights to</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything else.</v>

2636
01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:26.820
<v Speaker 3>I think she owns the rights to Kurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2637
01:56:26.970 --> 01:56:30.390
<v Speaker 3>so like I don't think they could do</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything else if they wanted to show</v>

2638
01:56:30.391 --> 01:56:33.810
<v Speaker 3>that movie and depict those stories and</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you just not do it?</v>

2639
01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:36.390
<v Speaker 3>Well then they just write a book.</v>

2640
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:42.430
<v Speaker 3>The problem is people won't read books</v>
<v Speaker 3>and another problem is if you want</v>

2641
01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:47.520
<v Speaker 3>people to pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would have to listen to her actual</v>

2642
01:56:47.521 --> 01:56:52.080
<v Speaker 3>voice saying a bunch of crazy shit which</v>
<v Speaker 3>is in that documentary when you hear her</v>

2643
01:56:52.081 --> 01:56:56.970
<v Speaker 3>actual voice lying about like having a</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug overdose and making these publicity</v>

2644
01:56:56.971 --> 01:57:01.320
<v Speaker 3>stunts and lying to him about where she</v>
<v Speaker 3>found the suicide note or you know,</v>

2645
01:57:01.321 --> 01:57:04.230
<v Speaker 3>when she said she found it under the bed</v>
<v Speaker 3>or under the pillows and he's like,</v>

2646
01:57:04.231 --> 01:57:06.420
<v Speaker 3>well here's the problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I checked other pillows.</v>

2647
01:57:06.421 --> 01:57:08.400
<v Speaker 3>We chucked under all the pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We checked on there everything.</v>

2648
01:57:08.401 --> 01:57:10.800
<v Speaker 3>We scoured that room and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2649
01:57:10.801 --> 01:57:15.570
<v Speaker 3>I says like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you hear that and then when</v>

2650
01:57:15.571 --> 01:57:20.571
<v Speaker 3>you see the actual physical evidence of</v>
<v Speaker 3>her copying Kurt cobain's handwriting</v>

2651
01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:24.480
<v Speaker 3>and then you see the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>the suicide note,</v>

2652
01:57:24.481 --> 01:57:28.500
<v Speaker 3>which is three mostly like seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight suicide note is him talking about</v>

2653
01:57:28.501 --> 01:57:29.610
<v Speaker 3>non related stuff.</v>

2654
01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:33.600
<v Speaker 3>And then the last tiny portion of it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the suicide note,</v>

2655
01:57:33.601 --> 01:57:35.520
<v Speaker 3>which is clearly an indifferent</v>
<v Speaker 3>handwriting.</v>

2656
01:57:35.970 --> 01:57:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Bigger letters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>

2657
01:57:37.351 --> 01:57:38.980
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did she fucking write this?</v>

2658
01:57:38.981 --> 01:57:41.700
<v Speaker 3>Like it still doesn't mean that she</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed them.</v>

2659
01:57:41.810 --> 01:57:46.810
<v Speaker 3>It couldn't mean that crazy bitch wrote</v>
<v Speaker 3>a suicide note for him to make herself</v>

2660
01:57:47.761 --> 01:57:51.240
<v Speaker 3>look awesome that he loved them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just fucking crazy.</v>

2661
01:57:51.690 --> 01:57:54.450
<v Speaker 3>She's fucking crazy if I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think there's anybody that</v>

2662
01:57:54.451 --> 01:57:56.550
<v Speaker 3>believes that she's not crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2663
01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:57.960
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would be.</v>

2664
01:57:57.961 --> 01:57:59.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's a person that</v>
<v Speaker 3>would go nuts.</v>

2665
01:58:00.030 --> 01:58:02.220
<v Speaker 3>She's totally safe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she could be out of her mind.</v>

2666
01:58:02.221 --> 01:58:03.980
<v Speaker 3>She could be a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She can be all those things.</v>

2667
01:58:03.981 --> 01:58:07.500
<v Speaker 3>It's still not be guilty of murder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's nothing in that documentary</v>

2668
01:58:07.501 --> 01:58:10.230
<v Speaker 3>that shows that she killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing.</v>

2669
01:58:10.290 --> 01:58:14.130
<v Speaker 3>It's just that it just shows she's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which everybody already knew.</v>

2670
01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:15.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when it like it.</v>

2671
01:58:15.271 --> 01:58:19.860
<v Speaker 3>Everyone made a big deal about it and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like the reenacting really took me</v>

2672
01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:23.100
<v Speaker 3>completely picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen so many things.</v>

2673
01:58:23.130 --> 01:58:26.160
<v Speaker 3>Like everyone knows she's batshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't surprise me at all if she</v>

2674
01:58:26.161 --> 01:58:26.994
<v Speaker 3>did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

2675
01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:28.190
<v Speaker 3>Well the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2676
01:58:28.190 --> 01:58:32.160
<v Speaker 3>the sheriff killed the police work is so</v>
<v Speaker 3>piss poor.</v>

2677
01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:33.900
<v Speaker 3>That was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the most disturbing things about</v>

2678
01:58:33.901 --> 01:58:36.510
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you find out what was it,</v>

2679
01:58:36.511 --> 01:58:40.050
<v Speaker 3>like 94 when he died or something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was like 1974.</v>

2680
01:58:40.270 --> 01:58:44.530
<v Speaker 3>And so we're pre internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the accountability was minimal.</v>

2681
01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:46.180
<v Speaker 3>Small town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2682
01:58:46.181 --> 01:58:49.720
<v Speaker 3>ate a small area and then it was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Seattle police department.</v>

2683
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:53.230
<v Speaker 3>The sheriff was a fucking idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up a bunch of other cases.</v>

2684
01:58:53.231 --> 01:58:56.890
<v Speaker 3>Eventually he was kicked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was all sorts of bad police work</v>

2685
01:58:56.891 --> 01:58:59.740
<v Speaker 3>going on on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The difference between the first</v>

2686
01:58:59.741 --> 01:59:03.490
<v Speaker 3>responders accounts of the murder scene</v>
<v Speaker 3>versus his response.</v>

2687
01:59:03.820 --> 01:59:06.460
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference between the image of the</v>

2688
01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:09.850
<v Speaker 3>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's allergies,</v>

2689
01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:15.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm the first responder said you could</v>
<v Speaker 3>clearly tell who it is and then you</v>

2690
01:59:15.371 --> 01:59:15.970
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

2691
01:59:15.970 --> 01:59:18.640
<v Speaker 3>their version of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that his face was blown off like,</v>

2692
01:59:18.641 --> 01:59:22.450
<v Speaker 3>well those are two different versions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that they cremated him six days</v>

2693
01:59:22.451 --> 01:59:24.550
<v Speaker 3>later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that they called it a suicide</v>

2694
01:59:24.610 --> 01:59:27.880
<v Speaker 3>instantly before the autopsy was</v>
<v Speaker 3>performed,</v>

2695
01:59:27.881 --> 01:59:31.240
<v Speaker 3>that you're supposed to leave that to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>forensic scientists to go over the</v>

2696
01:59:31.241 --> 01:59:33.580
<v Speaker 3>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just as a cluster fuck,</v>

2697
01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:36.340
<v Speaker 3>but in that cluster fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't try to kill themselves.</v>

2698
01:59:36.850 --> 01:59:38.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2699
01:59:38.770 --> 01:59:40.880
<v Speaker 3>I do not know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other thing is I don't know.</v>

2700
01:59:40.930 --> 01:59:44.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they say that he had three times</v>

2701
01:59:44.561 --> 01:59:48.460
<v Speaker 3>the lethal dose of heroin in his system</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that he wouldn't have been able to</v>

2702
01:59:48.461 --> 01:59:48.970
<v Speaker 3>pull the trigger.</v>

2703
01:59:48.970 --> 01:59:51.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if maybe he had an insane</v>

2704
01:59:51.521 --> 01:59:53.110
<v Speaker 3>tolerance because he did a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>heroin.</v>

2705
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:56.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe three times for you and I,</v>

2706
01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:58.630
<v Speaker 3>but not three times for him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2707
01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:00.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was,</v>

2708
02:00:00.610 --> 02:00:02.560
<v Speaker 3>it was creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's creepy documentary.</v>

2709
02:00:03.550 --> 02:00:06.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean that whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That whole metal seem as creepy as shit.</v>

2710
02:00:06.821 --> 02:00:07.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even like when,</v>

2711
02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:08.771
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2712
02:00:08.771 --> 02:00:10.470
<v Speaker 3>what's his face?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scott Weiland it,</v>

2713
02:00:10.471 --> 02:00:13.450
<v Speaker 3>read that he passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2714
02:00:13.451 --> 02:00:15.850
<v Speaker 3>it's so terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I felt like every single person was</v>

2715
02:00:15.851 --> 02:00:16.211
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2716
02:00:16.211 --> 02:00:18.880
<v Speaker 3>that was going to Scott Weiland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met him.</v>

2717
02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:21.520
<v Speaker 3>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dana White's a birthday party dean and</v>

2718
02:00:21.521 --> 02:00:25.000
<v Speaker 3>while he was president of the UFC and</v>
<v Speaker 3>performed stone temple pilots performed</v>

<v Speaker 3>swollen.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like three times and every time they</v>

2721
02:00:32.621 --> 02:00:33.280
<v Speaker 3>were awesome.</v>

2722
02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:36.280
<v Speaker 3>They performed in a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a ballroom for.</v>

2723
02:00:36.430 --> 02:00:39.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe there was like 200 people</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and the people that were paying</v>

2724
02:00:39.641 --> 02:00:42.100
<v Speaker 3>attention when they went on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like maybe 40,</v>

2725
02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:46.420
<v Speaker 3>like we had to get people up towards the</v>
<v Speaker 3>stage to pay attention.</v>

2726

<v Speaker 3>That motherfucker rocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he was in front of $25,000.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I remember being humbled.</v>

2729
02:00:56.140 --> 02:00:58.940
<v Speaker 3>I remember seeing seeing that and going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 3>like that guy.</v>

02:01:28.210 --> 02:01:30.970
<v Speaker 3>out or whatever the fuck he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>

2742
02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:36.120
<v Speaker 3>he was like barely you there all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and always on edge and you know,</v>

2743
02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:40.310
<v Speaker 3>you could blame it on his creative</v>
<v Speaker 3>juices</v>

2744
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:42.800
<v Speaker 2>inside of him that made him such a</v>
<v Speaker 2>genius performer,</v>

2745
02:01:42.920 --> 02:01:44.750
<v Speaker 2>which are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is undeniable that he was a</v>

2746
02:01:44.751 --> 02:01:47.070
<v Speaker 2>genius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like performance wise and mean.</v>

2747
02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.840
<v Speaker 2>He put on a show like every time I ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw him,</v>

2748
02:01:50.330 --> 02:01:53.450
<v Speaker 2>that band play that he was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

2749
02:01:53.700 --> 02:01:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Did you read what the mother of his</v>
<v Speaker 2>children said about them?</v>

2750
02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Like that rolling stone thing him so</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up and then you would go to be</v>

2751
02:02:01.701 --> 02:02:05.390
<v Speaker 2>married to that and you have children</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that guy and then he had new</v>

2752
02:02:05.391 --> 02:02:09.350
<v Speaker 2>children with their new wife and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sort of didn't talk to the old.</v>

2753
02:02:09.530 --> 02:02:11.690
<v Speaker 2>And of course obviously that's her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her story.</v>

2754
02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:15.870
<v Speaker 2>Who knows how crazy she is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows what the reality of it.</v>

2755
02:02:16.010 --> 02:02:18.860
<v Speaker 2>You could die and your ex boyfriend</v>
<v Speaker 2>could write a fucking crazy book about</v>

2756
02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:20.270
<v Speaker 2>yearning to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2758
02:02:21.590 --> 02:02:23.820
<v Speaker 2>we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is set.</v>

2759
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:25.910
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking crazy drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That heroin.</v>

2760
02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never in a million years touch</v>

2761
02:02:28.881 --> 02:02:31.180
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it made you like so good.</v>

2762
02:02:31.550 --> 02:02:33.140

<v Speaker 2>Afraid.</v>

2764
02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:37.210
<v Speaker 2>Microdose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be the one that would die like the</v>

2765
02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:39.530
<v Speaker 2>first time trying died first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying it.</v>

2766
02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:40.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2767

<v Speaker 2>I gotta let to live for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they find out it's averse reaction</v>

2768
02:02:43.641 --> 02:02:45.680
<v Speaker 2>to Claritin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Claritin,</v>

2769
02:02:45.681 --> 02:02:46.580
<v Speaker 2>d.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>hour yet.</v>

2772
02:02:49.821 --> 02:02:53.270

<v Speaker 2>It seems to have an awesome effect on</v>

2773
02:02:53.730 --> 02:02:57.130
<v Speaker 2>musicians so well until they die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2774
02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:00.420
<v Speaker 2>but up until up until age 27.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After that,</v>

2775
02:03:00.421 --> 02:03:02.930
<v Speaker 2>it seems to drop off radically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like all the age.</v>

2776
02:03:02.931 --> 02:03:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Twenty seven people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2777
02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Janis Joplin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morrison a Hendrix winehouse.</v>

2778
02:03:09.710 --> 02:03:12.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm Kurt cobain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2779
02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:14.420
<v Speaker 2>they all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all 27.</v>

2780
02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:17.390
<v Speaker 2>So bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At 27 is the age that everybody just</v>

2781
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Illuminati.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that five thing.</v>

2782
02:03:21.670 --> 02:03:26.120
<v Speaker 2>It is high five HIV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually what I have.</v>

2783
02:03:26.121 --> 02:03:29.420
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's the age coming out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your nose.</v>

2784
02:03:29.421 --> 02:03:31.420
<v Speaker 2>The night agencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to touch it.</v>

2785
02:03:31.421 --> 02:03:34.380
<v Speaker 2>AIDS AIDS is acronym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2786
02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:37.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a drug that has a more unique</v>

2787
02:03:37.881 --> 02:03:40.670
<v Speaker 2>relationship to music than heroin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

2788
02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:46.120
<v Speaker 2>The only comedian that I knew that was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroine guy was Hedberg and Mitch</v>

2789
02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:51.400
<v Speaker 2>Hedberg had like a sort of almost like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>jazzy sort of sense of humor and it was</v>

2790
02:03:52.371 --> 02:03:53.980
<v Speaker 2>like a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even his voice,</v>

2791
02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:56.570
<v Speaker 2>he spoke and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

2792
02:03:56.571 --> 02:03:58.180
<v Speaker 2>it was like a cool cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2793
02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:59.210
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2794
02:03:59.630 --> 02:04:01.970
<v Speaker 2>He would do his act sometimes with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to the crowd.</v>

2795
02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:05.990
<v Speaker 2>It would turn and do it and kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was killing it wouldn't even looking</v>

2796
02:04:05.991 --> 02:04:06.824
<v Speaker 2>at everybody.</v>

2797
02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:08.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something about that confidence</v>

2798
02:04:08.601 --> 02:04:11.240
<v Speaker 2>due to do something that just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>outrageous.</v>

2799
02:04:11.241 --> 02:04:14.720
<v Speaker 2>Turn your back to the crowd but not give</v>
<v Speaker 2>a shit.</v>

2800
02:04:14.721 --> 02:04:15.780
<v Speaker 2>You're not nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

2801
02:04:15.790 --> 02:04:17.750
<v Speaker 2>they would sniff you out if you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2802
02:04:17.810 --> 02:04:19.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're scared,</v>

2803
02:04:19.180 --> 02:04:22.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's like he had such control over</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody that he just could do it and</v>

2804
02:04:22.461 --> 02:04:23.720
<v Speaker 2>everybody would laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2805
02:04:23.721 --> 02:04:26.420
<v Speaker 2>he was a unique guy in that for a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2806
02:04:26.421 --> 02:04:31.421
<v Speaker 2>He had a real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a following certain acts like when they</v>

2807
02:04:32.090 --> 02:04:35.900
<v Speaker 2>would say if you get booked in like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny bone and Columbus,</v>

2808
02:04:35.901 --> 02:04:37.680
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get there,</v>

2809
02:04:37.910 --> 02:04:38.250
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2810
02:04:38.250 --> 02:04:40.830
<v Speaker 3>unless you are a big draw to the point</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you say,</v>

2811
02:04:40.831 --> 02:04:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm bringing my opening acts with me.</v>

2812
02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:46.800
<v Speaker 3>They would book local people and so they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have some guy like I know a story</v>

2813
02:04:46.801 --> 02:04:48.960
<v Speaker 3>where he went to this club.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had a local guy,</v>

2814
02:04:48.961 --> 02:04:51.840
<v Speaker 3>local guy before him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His fucking literally doing handstands.</v>

2815
02:04:51.841 --> 02:04:53.820
<v Speaker 3>He's singing and dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has music.</v>

2816
02:04:53.821 --> 02:04:55.920
<v Speaker 3>He plays,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does a wrap to close.</v>

2817
02:04:56.070 --> 02:04:58.140
<v Speaker 3>He closed with a wrapped audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes crazy,</v>

2818
02:04:58.470 --> 02:05:00.750
<v Speaker 3>and then Hedberg goes up there with</v>
<v Speaker 3>sunglasses on,</v>

2819
02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:03.390
<v Speaker 3>stands in front of the microphone and</v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

2820
02:05:03.450 --> 02:05:06.300
<v Speaker 3>somebody asked me if I want a banana</v>
<v Speaker 3>frozen banana.</v>

2821
02:05:06.301 --> 02:05:06.931
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2822
02:05:06.931 --> 02:05:09.810
<v Speaker 3>but I want a regular banana later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yes,</v>

2823
02:05:11.250 --> 02:05:14.460
<v Speaker 3>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But not after some dudes doing flips and</v>

2824
02:05:14.461 --> 02:05:17.370
<v Speaker 3>standing on his head and then shooting</v>
<v Speaker 3>rockets on his dick.</v>

2825
02:05:17.590 --> 02:05:18.780
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy</v>

2826
02:05:20.330 --> 02:05:22.770
<v Speaker 3>might be exaggerating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2827
02:05:22.771 --> 02:05:23.300
<v Speaker 3>there's like.</v>

2828
02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:26.730
<v Speaker 3>So he would bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would have these horrible sets until</v>

2829
02:05:26.731 --> 02:05:29.430
<v Speaker 3>he found his audience and then when</v>
<v Speaker 3>people knew what to expect,</v>

2830
02:05:29.431 --> 02:05:32.010
<v Speaker 3>like from lettermen appearances and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you,</v>

2831
02:05:32.250 --> 02:05:34.830
<v Speaker 3>then they knew what to expect and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>would go to cm and then finally they</v>

2832
02:05:34.831 --> 02:05:39.570
<v Speaker 3>started doing the opening act correctly</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that guy had a really hard time</v>

2833
02:05:39.571 --> 02:05:41.760
<v Speaker 3>though because of the way we so</v>
<v Speaker 3>specific,</v>

2834
02:05:41.761 --> 02:05:44.730
<v Speaker 3>like the kind of comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you could probably go anywhere and</v>

2835
02:05:44.731 --> 02:05:47.940
<v Speaker 3>you could check the crowd out and go</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2836
02:05:47.970 --> 02:05:49.230
<v Speaker 3>you could figure it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2837
02:05:49.231 --> 02:05:51.810
<v Speaker 3>in your head when something is working,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they like and what they don't like,</v>

2838
02:05:52.980 --> 02:05:56.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even depends if someone's there to see</v>

2839
02:05:57.660 --> 02:06:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Gilbert Melendez,</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2842

<v Speaker 3>Fluffy.</v>

2844

<v Speaker 3>after that or some,</v>

2850
02:06:29.590 --> 02:06:34.230

2855
02:06:44.970 --> 02:06:48.480
<v Speaker 3>there's some crowds that just don't work</v>
<v Speaker 3>for you for your style of humor,</v>

2856
02:06:48.540 --> 02:06:52.110
<v Speaker 3>but like if you were going on a show and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you Anthony Jeselnik and bill</v>

2857
02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:53.630
<v Speaker 3>burr wouldn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2858
02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:58.170
<v Speaker 3>It's all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've done that 20,</v>

2859
02:06:58.171 --> 02:07:02.240
<v Speaker 3>30 times at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's I think probably in my head.</v>

2860
02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Well the store you'll have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

2861
02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:06.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone might go on and.</v>

2862
02:07:06.180 --> 02:07:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Well they're really good at the store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like setting the lineup and it really</v>

2863
02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:13.230
<v Speaker 3>sort of homogenous way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a horrible show there.</v>

2864
02:07:13.231 --> 02:07:17.430
<v Speaker 3>I rarely do the some girl I guess was</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to put together a show and it was</v>

2865
02:07:17.431 --> 02:07:20.460
<v Speaker 3>like bring her show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it was.</v>

2866
02:07:20.620 --> 02:07:21.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll do like,</v>

2867
02:07:21.271 --> 02:07:24.060
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want my room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a weeknight in the main room?</v>

2868
02:07:24.190 --> 02:07:26.680
<v Speaker 3>It was like Monday night in the main</v>
<v Speaker 3>room with a shadows.</v>

2869
02:07:26.730 --> 02:07:28.680
<v Speaker 3>Never first time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

2870
02:07:28.830 --> 02:07:30.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm in main room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight people,</v>

2871
02:07:30.460 --> 02:07:31.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just mad.</v>

2872
02:07:31.681 --> 02:07:35.280
<v Speaker 3>It was just absolutely bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything I said bomb like nothing.</v>

2873
02:07:35.290 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 3>And I was just going</v>

2874
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:40.030
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many more minutes do a red light?</v>

2875
02:07:40.031 --> 02:07:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Could you flick that at me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was just,</v>

2876
02:07:42.071 --> 02:07:43.420
<v Speaker 1>it was bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't like,</v>

2877
02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:45.280
<v Speaker 1>this is not my crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

2878
02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:47.460
<v Speaker 3>they had a show there the other day and</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2879
02:07:47.550 --> 02:07:49.290
<v Speaker 3>I got there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excuse me.</v>

2880
02:07:49.380 --> 02:07:53.070
<v Speaker 3>I got there and the waitresses are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2881
02:07:53.310 --> 02:07:55.830
<v Speaker 3>go to the main room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see this fucking show in the main room.</v>

2882
02:07:55.831 --> 02:07:56.670
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>

2883
02:07:56.910 --> 02:07:59.400
<v Speaker 3>They go a cult rented out the main room</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>

2884
02:07:59.401 --> 02:08:03.270
<v Speaker 3>what are you serious?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went in there and when I went in</v>

2885
02:08:03.271 --> 02:08:04.860
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the show was just ending.</v>

2886
02:08:04.861 --> 02:08:07.790
<v Speaker 3>The comedy show was just ending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So some comedian was onstage.</v>

2887
02:08:07.860 --> 02:08:10.410
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who the comedian was and it</v>

2888
02:08:10.411 --> 02:08:12.420
<v Speaker 3>just wasn't going so well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going okay.</v>

2889
02:08:12.421 --> 02:08:14.250
<v Speaker 3>But it was just very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very strange.</v>

2890
02:08:14.460 --> 02:08:17.520
<v Speaker 3>And then after the show they all huddled</v>
<v Speaker 3>up around mother,</v>

2891
02:08:18.030 --> 02:08:20.310
<v Speaker 3>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this woman that they called mother who</v>

2892
02:08:20.311 --> 02:08:24.570
<v Speaker 3>was the head of the cult and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 50 people around her.</v>

2893
02:08:24.571 --> 02:08:28.980
<v Speaker 3>They're all dressed to the nines suits</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ties like the nicest dresses,</v>

2894
02:08:28.981 --> 02:08:31.050
<v Speaker 3>like everybody's dressed up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're going to a,</v>

2895
02:08:31.060 --> 02:08:32.280
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an award show,</v>

2896
02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:32.940
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2897
02:08:32.940 --> 02:08:37.230
<v Speaker 3>And mother sat around with her back to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stage where they're all facing her.</v>

2898
02:08:37.231 --> 02:08:39.160
<v Speaker 3>Like as if she was on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she might as well have been on</v>

2899
02:08:39.161 --> 02:08:41.850
<v Speaker 3>stage and she was talking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2900
02:08:41.851 --> 02:08:44.880
<v Speaker 3>like really like self help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonsense,</v>

2901
02:08:44.881 --> 02:08:48.090
<v Speaker 3>sort of fucking cookie cutter</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientology style,</v>

2902
02:08:48.091 --> 02:08:50.040
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2903
02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:54.510
<v Speaker 3>our intention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we put out into the world is what</v>

2904
02:08:54.511 --> 02:08:57.510
<v Speaker 3>the world gives us back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you love yourself,</v>

2905
02:08:57.511 --> 02:09:01.530
<v Speaker 3>the world loves that kind of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were all like cheering along</v>

2906
02:09:01.531 --> 02:09:05.340
<v Speaker 3>with it and clapping with her and say it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was so fucking strange.</v>

2907
02:09:05.370 --> 02:09:06.480
<v Speaker 3>It was so strange.</v>

2908
02:09:06.570 --> 02:09:08.580
<v Speaker 1>But they rented the room like how did</v>
<v Speaker 1>they even rent them?</v>

2909
02:09:08.820 --> 02:09:11.390
<v Speaker 3>Don't understand what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happened because I got</v>

2910
02:09:11.391 --> 02:09:12.160
<v Speaker 3>there late,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2911
02:09:12.160 --> 02:09:14.490
<v Speaker 3>I got there like as it was ending,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last comment was onstage,</v>

2912
02:09:14.570 --> 02:09:18.450
<v Speaker 3>but Al Madrigal had been on earlier and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just fucking eaten deck up there</v>

2913
02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:22.730
<v Speaker 3>and he apparently goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck kind of crowd is this.</v>

2914
02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Like he was saying it while he was up</v>
<v Speaker 3>there because he realized he looked out</v>

2915
02:09:26.391 --> 02:09:30.060
<v Speaker 3>and he sees all these people with suits</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ties and dresses and they're all</v>

2916
02:09:30.110 --> 02:09:32.480
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all fucking super lost.</v>

2917
02:09:32.481 --> 02:09:37.481
<v Speaker 3>I mean like really lost strange people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget first sitting there</v>

2918
02:09:38.391 --> 02:09:40.790
<v Speaker 3>and then gathered around her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to her,</v>

2919
02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:43.700
<v Speaker 3>listening to her every hang on every</v>
<v Speaker 3>word she says.</v>

2920
02:09:43.701 --> 02:09:48.701
<v Speaker 3>We saw bird feeding its babies</v>
<v Speaker 3>spit and it was all just waiting for it.</v>

2921
02:09:50.111 --> 02:09:51.830
<v Speaker 3>A hallmark card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

2922
02:09:51.831 --> 02:09:54.890
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really strange.</v>

2923
02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:56.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2924
02:09:56.300 --> 02:09:59.390
<v Speaker 3>Well that whole self help thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know if you are,</v>

2925
02:09:59.450 --> 02:10:02.420
<v Speaker 3>if you're so inclined you can piece</v>
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>

2926
02:10:02.421 --> 02:10:06.230
<v Speaker 3>especially today like it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about like Anthony</v>

2927
02:10:06.230 --> 02:10:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Robbins days of 1988 or nobody else was</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it and you had to actually have</v>

2928
02:10:11.571 --> 02:10:15.360
<v Speaker 3>some really concise thoughts about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>to improve yourself.</v>

2929
02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:18.740
<v Speaker 3>They're repeating other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's come up with something brand</v>

2930
02:10:18.741 --> 02:10:19.820
<v Speaker 3>spanking new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2931
02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:20.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you.</v>

2932
02:10:20.571 --> 02:10:23.360
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is sort of mind the</v>
<v Speaker 3>internet for these things,</v>

2933
02:10:23.570 --> 02:10:26.660
<v Speaker 3>repackage them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reshape them and put on a seminar and</v>

2934
02:10:26.661 --> 02:10:28.600
<v Speaker 3>have all these people together and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people that are doing that.</v>

2935
02:10:28.610 --> 02:10:31.460
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That voice and that's just that weird,</v>

2936
02:10:31.970 --> 02:10:33.510
<v Speaker 3>odd look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2937
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:35.720
<v Speaker 2>I watched that documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The source family.</v>

2938
02:10:35.721 --> 02:10:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever see that one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2939
02:10:37.221 --> 02:10:39.200
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty Whitney.</v>

2940
02:10:39.201 --> 02:10:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Cummings was telling me I have to see</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2941
02:10:40.491 --> 02:10:44.510
<v Speaker 2>It's good because I don't think anybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>really heard of it because the guy</v>

2942
02:10:44.511 --> 02:10:46.550
<v Speaker 2>didn't like do a Mass Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2943
02:10:46.551 --> 02:10:50.690
<v Speaker 2>like he fucking got an angle either in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawaii and said,</v>

2944
02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:54.770
<v Speaker 2>Jesus wants me to fly out and then say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2945
02:10:54.771 --> 02:10:59.150
<v Speaker 2>he didn't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's how Jesus wanted them to</v>

2946
02:10:59.151 --> 02:10:59.931
<v Speaker 2>come to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2947
02:10:59.931 --> 02:11:01.310
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't kill his people.</v>

2948
02:11:01.311 --> 02:11:02.330
<v Speaker 2>He just was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nope.</v>

2949
02:11:02.331 --> 02:11:05.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting vibes that I need to go on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this hang glider on this cliff and</v>

2950
02:11:06.710 --> 02:11:11.210
<v Speaker 2>that's a fucked up way to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually he survived and then died</v>

2951
02:11:11.211 --> 02:11:12.110
<v Speaker 2>like a few,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2952
02:11:12.710 --> 02:11:14.480
<v Speaker 2>one or two days later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2953
02:11:14.481 --> 02:11:15.410
<v Speaker 2>But Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less,</v>

2954
02:11:15.470 --> 02:11:17.900
<v Speaker 2>less exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was fun.</v>

2955
02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:19.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

2956
02:11:19.791 --> 02:11:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's what he was hoping for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hang gliding seems like a fucking</v>

2957
02:11:24.140 --> 02:11:26.630
<v Speaker 2>great time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not trying it.</v>

2958
02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:28.520
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to like,</v>

2959
02:11:28.521 --> 02:11:29.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2960
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:30.530
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2961
02:11:30.531 --> 02:11:33.410
<v Speaker 2>you have to depend on the wind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like depending on things like</v>

2962
02:11:33.411 --> 02:11:35.090
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not into depending on wind,</v>

2963
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:37.760
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does whatever the fuck it wants.</v>

2964
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't want to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

2965
02:11:40.750 --> 02:11:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like tell him no,</v>

2966
02:11:42.890 --> 02:11:46.370
<v Speaker 2>that would be like floating in the water</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a boat,</v>

2967
02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:50.570
<v Speaker 2>sailing around on a boat in and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>sudden the boat decides it doesn't want</v>

2968

02:16:53.370 --> 02:16:54.203
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

3084
02:16:56.090 --> 02:16:59.890
<v Speaker 3>was a judge of the Cannabis Cup once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what that is.</v>

3085
02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:04.050
<v Speaker 3>The Cannabis Cup is this thing where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they judge a weed and they decide like,</v>

3086
02:17:04.060 --> 02:17:06.100
<v Speaker 3>what's the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it like one of those beer?</v>

3087
02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:08.470
<v Speaker 3>It's way worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing,</v>

3088
02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:13.570
<v Speaker 3>you don't have any idea which one is</v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting you better or not or you don't</v>

3089
02:17:13.571 --> 02:17:14.950
<v Speaker 3>know like this is what the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3090
02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:18.400
<v Speaker 3>like um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like old people have like those Monday</v>

3091
02:17:18.401 --> 02:17:21.580
<v Speaker 3>through Sunday pillow things and each</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

3092
02:17:21.630 --> 02:17:23.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you pop them open and you take it.</v>

3093
02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:25.600
<v Speaker 3>It was that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would give you one of those.</v>

3094
02:17:25.900 --> 02:17:29.710
<v Speaker 3>I said I had it with a dried wheat in it</v>
<v Speaker 3>for like the longest sitting on.</v>

3095
02:17:29.711 --> 02:17:31.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to save this and I put it</v>

3096
02:17:31.421 --> 02:17:33.700
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just does a nostalgia for the highest</v>

3097
02:17:33.701 --> 02:17:35.800
<v Speaker 3>I've ever been in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I get there.</v>

3098
02:17:36.550 --> 02:17:38.680
<v Speaker 3>They give everybody that's a judge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They asked me to be a,</v>

3099
02:17:38.681 --> 02:17:41.230
<v Speaker 3>just to give everybody who's a judge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of these little boxes with all these</v>

3100
02:17:41.231 --> 02:17:44.140
<v Speaker 3>different strains in it and each one has</v>
<v Speaker 3>a name and you know,</v>

3101
02:17:44.141 --> 02:17:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Blah Blah Blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the name,</v>

3102
02:17:45.550 --> 02:17:47.260
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to start smoking it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3103
02:17:47.410 --> 02:17:48.880
<v Speaker 3>So you started some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't know what,</v>

3104
02:17:48.940 --> 02:17:51.850
<v Speaker 3>what's getting you high and what's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>your highest fuck?</v>

3105
02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:54.550
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we went into this place that they did</v>

3106
02:17:54.551 --> 02:17:56.290
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just this place on melrose.</v>

3107
02:17:56.291 --> 02:17:58.210
<v Speaker 3>It was like a head shop in the back of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the head shop.</v>

3108
02:17:58.211 --> 02:18:02.710
<v Speaker 3>They had this big giant room where all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people ran and I remember just</v>

3109
02:18:02.890 --> 02:18:07.890
<v Speaker 3>being just completely blitzed out of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind by the time I got to Tuesday,</v>

3110
02:18:10.570 --> 02:18:11.500
<v Speaker 3>Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thursday,</v>

3111
02:18:11.501 --> 02:18:14.260
<v Speaker 3>Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saturday and Sunday I am fucked up man</v>

3112
02:18:14.590 --> 02:18:16.720
<v Speaker 3>and people are handing me cookies and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just eating them.</v>

3113
02:18:17.390 --> 02:18:21.220
<v Speaker 3>They're just eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are handing me bags like those a</v>

3114
02:18:21.221 --> 02:18:23.890
<v Speaker 3>volcano bags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking sucking on a volcano bag.</v>

3115
02:18:24.100 --> 02:18:27.400
<v Speaker 3>I just went as deep as I've ever gone in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my life.</v>

3116
02:18:27.430 --> 02:18:32.430
<v Speaker 3>How many days before you came to?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was legitimately high for 24 hours.</v>

3117
02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not like legitimately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you do anything?</v>

3118
02:18:35.801 --> 02:18:36.360
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3119
02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:37.510
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were you just sitting?</v>

3120
02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:42.160
<v Speaker 3>I just laid down after it was over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember thinking I can't even.</v>

3121
02:18:42.250 --> 02:18:44.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even form sentences.</v>

3122
02:18:44.051 --> 02:18:46.630
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't know what I was doing.</v>

3123
02:18:46.631 --> 02:18:48.580
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is I got,</v>

3124
02:18:48.670 --> 02:18:53.670
<v Speaker 3>I got so high that people stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stopped looking like people to me</v>

3125
02:18:54.910 --> 02:18:58.810
<v Speaker 3>and what they started being is like two</v>
<v Speaker 3>dimensional,</v>

3126
02:18:58.990 --> 02:19:03.990
<v Speaker 3>like a cardboard cut out like a movie</v>
<v Speaker 3>Promo cutout of a person and then behind</v>

3127
02:19:04.031 --> 02:19:07.450
<v Speaker 3>that person was like their soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like peeking around the corner,</v>

3128
02:19:07.451 --> 02:19:10.200
<v Speaker 3>like looking at you like they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>walking towards you with this like</v>

3129
02:19:10.240 --> 02:19:13.300
<v Speaker 3>cardboard cutout and behind them this.</v>

3130
02:19:13.330 --> 02:19:16.150
<v Speaker 3>That's how the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like the impression that I got</v>

3131
02:19:16.151 --> 02:19:18.070
<v Speaker 3>from looking at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's just like a two dimensional</v>

3132
02:19:18.071 --> 02:19:22.060
<v Speaker 3>outside and then I could occasionally</v>
<v Speaker 3>seek glimpses of the real self,</v>

3133
02:19:22.061 --> 02:19:24.640
<v Speaker 3>like peeking around the corner looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>at me and then Heidi,</v>

3134
02:19:26.070 --> 02:19:27.590
<v Speaker 3>I was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3135
02:19:27.591 --> 02:19:28.420
<v Speaker 3>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

3136
02:19:28.420 --> 02:19:32.540
<v Speaker 3>I was untethered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>untethered from reality from life.</v>

3137
02:19:32.850 --> 02:19:33.740
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

3138
02:19:34.370 --> 02:19:37.740
<v Speaker 3>I was gone and I remember having this</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird conversation with this.</v>

3139
02:19:37.790 --> 02:19:39.470
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing about these marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

3140
02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:42.310
<v Speaker 3>especially marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what we're were talking like I</v>

3141
02:19:42.311 --> 02:19:45.620
<v Speaker 3>think I was a judge in 2003,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

3142
02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:48.280
<v Speaker 3>Two thousand two are still in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>system from the problem.</v>

3143
02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:53.210
<v Speaker 3>Probably still test positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the people that were into it,</v>

3144
02:19:53.340 --> 02:19:56.840
<v Speaker 3>the really involved in the quote unquote</v>
<v Speaker 3>cannabis community.</v>

3145
02:19:56.841 --> 02:20:00.800
<v Speaker 3>It was a small sort of tight knit group</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we're producing it and selling it</v>

3146
02:20:00.801 --> 02:20:02.690
<v Speaker 3>and growing it and they would gather</v>
<v Speaker 3>together so these,</v>

3147
02:20:02.880 --> 02:20:05.780
<v Speaker 3>they would use these things as an excuse</v>
<v Speaker 3>to kind of get together with everybody</v>

3148
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:11.000
<v Speaker 3>and that kind of in this conversation</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this guy who was banking on the</v>

3149
02:20:11.001 --> 02:20:14.450
<v Speaker 3>cannabis community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking care of him when he was old and</v>

3150
02:20:14.451 --> 02:20:17.120
<v Speaker 3>that's what he was like concentrating on</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it was.</v>

3151
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:18.620
<v Speaker 3>I was so high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just had to listen.</v>

3152
02:20:18.621 --> 02:20:22.010
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was wearing and he was saying,</v>

3153
02:20:22.011 --> 02:20:24.220
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this amazing thing is the cannabis</v>

3154
02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:26.230
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're gonna have me,</v>

3155
02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:29.000
<v Speaker 3>they're going to take care of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cannabis community will be there for</v>

3156
02:20:29.001 --> 02:20:29.834
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So right.</v>

3157
02:20:30.220 --> 02:20:31.870
<v Speaker 3>Nk with them or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3158
02:20:32.180 --> 02:20:34.130
<v Speaker 3>he thought the cannabis community was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the small,</v>

3159
02:20:34.131 --> 02:20:37.200
<v Speaker 3>tight knit thing and now it's a swarm of</v>
<v Speaker 3>humanity.</v>

3160
02:20:37.220 --> 02:20:39.680
<v Speaker 3>Even if there is no cannabis community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homey.</v>

3161
02:20:39.681 --> 02:20:41.230
<v Speaker 3>It's called life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3162
02:20:41.460 --> 02:20:43.910
<v Speaker 3>It's just humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to him it was like,</v>

3163
02:20:43.940 --> 02:20:46.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like local growers or whatever it was</v>

3164
02:20:46.791 --> 02:20:50.340
<v Speaker 3>like this local organic community of</v>
<v Speaker 3>work.</v>

3165
02:20:50.530 --> 02:20:54.290
<v Speaker 3>So it was just a strange conversation</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that was his angle was almost like</v>

3166
02:20:54.291 --> 02:20:57.620
<v Speaker 3>he was like really into pot because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>had given him an identity within this</v>

3167
02:20:57.621 --> 02:21:01.340
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was expressing that to me in this</v>

3168
02:21:01.370 --> 02:21:05.390
<v Speaker 3>very strange way and almost trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>like wrap my head around like what he</v>

3169
02:21:05.391 --> 02:21:07.460
<v Speaker 3>thought was gonna happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

3170
02:21:07.461 --> 02:21:08.620
<v Speaker 3>But he kept saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3171
02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:10.610
<v Speaker 3>the cannabis community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so always going to take care of me,</v>

3172
02:21:10.611 --> 02:21:11.520
<v Speaker 3>the cannabis community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3173
02:21:11.810 --> 02:21:13.420
<v Speaker 3>guess what dude?</v>

3174
02:21:13.450 --> 02:21:16.060
<v Speaker 3>just fucking people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are just going to take care of</v>

3175
02:21:16.061 --> 02:21:16.540
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3176
02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Another stoner dude</v>
<v Speaker 1>got out of the room,</v>

3177
02:21:23.570 --> 02:21:26.750
<v Speaker 1>one of my roommates in college one time</v>
<v Speaker 1>just ate a shit ton of pot brownies and</v>

3178

<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

<v Speaker 1>she's going to jump out of my car.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like she was really like freaked out.</v>

3193
02:22:05.420 --> 02:22:09.050
<v Speaker 1>in a way that nothing else can be any</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it won't go away.</v>

3194
02:22:09.051 --> 02:22:12.710
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing you can take or do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will have to wait it out.</v>

3195
02:22:12.711 --> 02:22:15.440
<v Speaker 1>And one thing that helps a little bit is</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

3196
02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Coffee does copy cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean if you're so whacked out</v>

3197
02:22:19.041 --> 02:22:21.880
<v Speaker 1>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to sit in a chair and wait</v>

3198
02:22:21.890 --> 02:22:23.110
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ride this out.</v>

3199
02:22:23.220 --> 02:22:24.980
<v Speaker 3>Do you know the different wall?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's.</v>

3200
02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:26.580
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about this so many times</v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

3201
02:22:26.581 --> 02:22:28.980
<v Speaker 3>People gonna get annoyed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do you know what happens when you</v>

3202
02:22:28.981 --> 02:22:31.230
<v Speaker 3>eat it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That there's a different like biological</v>

3203
02:22:31.231 --> 02:22:33.780
<v Speaker 3>processes opposed to smoking?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you smoke it,</v>

3204
02:22:33.781 --> 02:22:37.230
<v Speaker 3>you're your body's reacting to Thc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the active compound when you</v>

3205
02:22:37.231 --> 02:22:39.120
<v Speaker 3>smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you eat it,</v>

3206
02:22:39.121 --> 02:22:42.510
<v Speaker 3>it's processed by your liver and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>produces something called 11 hydroxy</v>

3207
02:22:42.511 --> 02:22:46.170
<v Speaker 3>metabolite that's five times more</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychoactive than thc.</v>

3208
02:22:46.590 --> 02:22:50.520
<v Speaker 3>It's insanely powerful and it's a much</v>
<v Speaker 3>more psychedelic drug.</v>

3209
02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:54.270
<v Speaker 3>Like you'll have hallucinations and</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if you close your eyes,</v>

3210
02:22:54.510 --> 02:22:56.940
<v Speaker 3>you can have some really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really intense.</v>

3211
02:22:57.130 --> 02:22:59.730
<v Speaker 3>That freaks me out too much in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

3212
02:22:59.731 --> 02:23:00.720
<v Speaker 3>I close my eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3213
02:23:01.140 --> 02:23:04.130
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

3214
02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:06.540
<v Speaker 3>I was on both when I was at the Cannabis</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cup.</v>

3215
02:23:06.541 --> 02:23:10.140
<v Speaker 3>That was what was so fucked up because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had been high from smoking it.</v>

3216
02:23:10.170 --> 02:23:13.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrible.</v>

3217
02:23:13.650 --> 02:23:15.990
<v Speaker 3>Throwing it up was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's alcohol,</v>

3218
02:23:16.330 --> 02:23:20.520
<v Speaker 3>if you throw up and you drink alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know it gets out of your system and</v>

3219
02:23:20.521 --> 02:23:20.970
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3220
02:23:20.970 --> 02:23:24.150
<v Speaker 3>it helps you sober up quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like if I was,</v>

3221
02:23:24.510 --> 02:23:26.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all do it stupid.</v>

3222
02:23:26.461 --> 02:23:31.200
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how we can take when we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>in college and I would drink until I was</v>

3223
02:23:31.201 --> 02:23:31.620
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

3224
02:23:31.620 --> 02:23:32.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hammered and then I will.</v>

3225
02:23:32.940 --> 02:23:34.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll look that.</v>

3226
02:23:34.141 --> 02:23:38.730
<v Speaker 3>And then I always appeared that'd be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>only time I'd ever puke was when I did</v>

3227
02:23:38.731 --> 02:23:39.211
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3228
02:23:39.211 --> 02:23:40.044
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to learn.</v>

3229
02:23:40.050 --> 02:23:41.960
<v Speaker 3>We'll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also because when you smoke you,</v>

3230
02:23:41.990 --> 02:23:45.480
<v Speaker 3>you become hyper aware and you're body</v>
<v Speaker 3>is aware of the poison side to you in</v>

3231
02:23:45.481 --> 02:23:46.920
<v Speaker 3>the form of alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And your body's like,</v>

3232
02:23:46.930 --> 02:23:49.180
<v Speaker 3>what did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get it out.</v>

3233
02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:53.513
<v Speaker 3>I took a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3234
02:23:53.780 --> 02:23:57.700
<v Speaker 3>a pot that sky made thc pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was this,</v>

3235
02:23:57.720 --> 02:23:59.430
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>

3236
02:23:59.431 --> 02:24:02.100
<v Speaker 3>he figured out how to make pills and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know how he did it,</v>

3237
02:24:02.310 --> 02:24:04.940
<v Speaker 3>but he made them in these capsules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

3238
02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:05.970
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to,</v>

3239
02:24:05.971 --> 02:24:08.340
<v Speaker 3>it has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's something that has to be fat</v>

3240
02:24:08.341 --> 02:24:09.200
<v Speaker 3>soluble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3241
02:24:09.420 --> 02:24:11.790
<v Speaker 3>like when you cook it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of times they cook or they</v>

3242
02:24:11.791 --> 02:24:13.760
<v Speaker 3>use butter and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3243
02:24:13.940 --> 02:24:17.280
<v Speaker 3>they melt the marijuana into the butter</v>
<v Speaker 3>that make it fat soluble.</v>

3244
02:24:17.281 --> 02:24:18.510
<v Speaker 3>The make your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3245
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:19.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand the process,</v>

3246
02:24:19.861 --> 02:24:22.140
<v Speaker 3>but he figured out how to do it and put</v>
<v Speaker 3>it into capsule forms.</v>

3247
02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:23.460
<v Speaker 3>So he told us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

3248
02:24:23.970 --> 02:24:24.870
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much should I take?</v>

3249
02:24:25.260 --> 02:24:27.120
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just take one pill because they're a</v>

3250
02:24:27.121 --> 02:24:28.680
<v Speaker 3>little packages of two pills that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave us.</v>

3251
02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:31.320
<v Speaker 3>It was just take one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my friend Eddie Bravo was like,</v>

3252
02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:32.880
<v Speaker 3>fuck that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm taking it too.</v>

3253
02:24:33.150 --> 02:24:34.380
<v Speaker 3>So he took two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listened.</v>

3254
02:24:34.410 --> 02:24:39.410
<v Speaker 3>I took one and I was fucking the</v>
<v Speaker 3>blitzkrieg and I wound up talking to</v>

3255
02:24:41.371 --> 02:24:44.940
<v Speaker 3>this guy and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was at a Jujitsu tournament and this</v>

3256
02:24:44.941 --> 02:24:47.850
<v Speaker 3>guy was one of the competitors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember thinking like,</v>

3257
02:24:47.851 --> 02:24:50.520
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's vibe is so crazy.</v>

3258
02:24:50.521 --> 02:24:52.280
<v Speaker 3>Like he's giving me like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you really hot,</v>

3259
02:24:52.500 --> 02:24:56.820
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was just because I'm that high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like insanely dangerous vibe about him.</v>

3260
02:24:57.750 --> 02:25:01.980
<v Speaker 3>Turns out he was a rapist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>turned into a rapist and um,</v>

3261
02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:04.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was on the run and uh,</v>

3262
02:25:04.530 --> 02:25:07.260
<v Speaker 3>went on the run and we went to a Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 3>tournament.</v>

3263
02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:07.800
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3264
02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:08.630
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

3265
02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:11.490
<v Speaker 3>he was a rapist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had done some other shit too.</v>

3266
02:25:11.700 --> 02:25:14.910
<v Speaker 3>One of the things he had done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had choked to death and then they</v>

3267
02:25:14.911 --> 02:25:19.660
<v Speaker 3>revived him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got in a street fight on a traffic</v>

3268
02:25:19.661 --> 02:25:21.720
<v Speaker 3>incident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of those mayhem or whatever.</v>

3269
02:25:21.730 --> 02:25:22.563
<v Speaker 3>Those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3270

<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

3271
02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:24.433
<v Speaker 3>I'm forgetting.</v>

02:25:24.940 --> 02:25:27.380
<v Speaker 2>I forget her name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More machines now.</v>

3273
02:25:27.460 --> 02:25:30.370
<v Speaker 2>That was another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on my podcast and actually just a</v>

3274
02:25:30.370 --> 02:25:33.540
<v Speaker 2>couple months before he did that with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the girl that he beat the fuck out if</v>

3275
02:25:33.541 --> 02:25:35.020
<v Speaker 2>she was here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

3276
02:25:35.021 --> 02:25:38.650
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst sounding story I ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw the whole thing on real sports.</v>

3277
02:25:38.651 --> 02:25:39.600
<v Speaker 2>They did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3278
02:25:39.601 --> 02:25:43.210
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On real sports on HBO is terrible.</v>

3279
02:25:43.730 --> 02:25:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was terrible.</v>

3280
02:25:45.310 --> 02:25:50.310
<v Speaker 2>That whole thing was a combination of</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is all the abuse that he</v>

3281
02:25:50.741 --> 02:25:52.540
<v Speaker 2>suffered in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steroids,</v>

3282
02:25:52.660 --> 02:25:56.260
<v Speaker 2>this fucking brain damage that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>unquestionably has.</v>

3283
02:25:56.800 --> 02:25:59.700
<v Speaker 2>So many of them have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brain damage is so many fighters.</v>

3284
02:25:59.800 --> 02:26:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Same Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The football players.</v>

3285
02:26:02.531 --> 02:26:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They snap the chronic and syphilis.</v>

3286
02:26:06.430 --> 02:26:07.263
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3287
02:26:07.500 --> 02:26:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Try it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3288
02:26:08.110 --> 02:26:11.400
<v Speaker 2>cte,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just any form of head trauma over</v>

3289
02:26:11.401 --> 02:26:13.900
<v Speaker 2>repeated periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scared cause issues,</v>

3290
02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:16.780
<v Speaker 2>but they keep talking about football</v>
<v Speaker 2>players and like you can't tell me that</v>

3291
02:26:16.781 --> 02:26:18.460
<v Speaker 2>like Nascar drivers don't have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3292
02:26:18.670 --> 02:26:20.770
<v Speaker 2>They reckon you have concussions all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3293
02:26:21.700 --> 02:26:23.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they were rick that much</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

3294
02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:26.730
<v Speaker 2>but it just takes a little like once</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3295
02:26:26.740 --> 02:26:29.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you've had one concussion it's</v>

3296
02:26:29.051 --> 02:26:32.800
<v Speaker 2>easier to get another and a lot of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>drivers have had multiple concussions.</v>

3297
02:26:32.830 --> 02:26:34.810
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never really thought about that.</v>

3298
02:26:34.811 --> 02:26:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I would think about different people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hockey.</v>

3299
02:26:37.610 --> 02:26:38.530
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly.</v>

3300
02:26:38.531 --> 02:26:40.330
<v Speaker 2>But it always seems to go to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>football.</v>

3301
02:26:40.331 --> 02:26:41.164
<v Speaker 2>But you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3302
02:26:41.170 --> 02:26:42.700
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know plenty.</v>

3303
02:26:43.150 --> 02:26:45.960
<v Speaker 2>I like car racing but like a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>open will,</v>

3304
02:26:47.050 --> 02:26:49.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they have just a barely at rec,</v>

3305
02:26:49.630 --> 02:26:51.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had,</v>

3306
02:26:51.610 --> 02:26:53.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have all the head neck restraints</v>

3307
02:26:53.211 --> 02:26:55.180
<v Speaker 2>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you hit the side of a wall,</v>

3308
02:26:55.450 --> 02:26:59.350
<v Speaker 2>you brand squash around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've already had three concussions</v>

3309
02:26:59.351 --> 02:27:03.010
<v Speaker 2>maybe in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with all the connective tissue,</v>

3310
02:27:03.011 --> 02:27:06.100
<v Speaker 2>the connective tissue that holds your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain inside your skull,</v>

3311
02:27:06.160 --> 02:27:07.180
<v Speaker 2>that stuff tears.</v>

3312
02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:09.080
<v Speaker 2>And when it tears it doesn't come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3313
02:27:09.490 --> 02:27:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

3314
02:27:10.350 --> 02:27:12.530
<v Speaker 2>I resilient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's done.</v>

3315
02:27:13.060 --> 02:27:14.280
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

3316
02:27:14.740 --> 02:27:16.780
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know like what that stuff was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3317
02:27:16.781 --> 02:27:21.330
<v Speaker 2>like what is the connected tissue leg</v>
<v Speaker 2>until I butchered a moose once and uh,</v>

3318
02:27:21.370 --> 02:27:22.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go right here.</v>

3319
02:27:22.750 --> 02:27:26.050
<v Speaker 2>And when we're lifting up the leg and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting the connective tissue,</v>

3320
02:27:26.230 --> 02:27:28.540
<v Speaker 2>it's like almost like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like candy,</v>

3321
02:27:28.620 --> 02:27:29.650
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3322
02:27:29.651 --> 02:27:30.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's that stuff called?</v>

3323
02:27:30.731 --> 02:27:33.510
<v Speaker 2>Cotton candy fibers look and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like,</v>

3324
02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.970
<v Speaker 2>it's so soft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just cuts right through.</v>

3325
02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:37.841
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3326
02:27:37.841 --> 02:27:41.800
<v Speaker 2>this is similar to the stuff that holds</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain in your head and you can</v>

3327
02:27:41.801 --> 02:27:46.480
<v Speaker 2>imagine over repeated traumatic impacts</v>
<v Speaker 2>like over and over again.</v>

3328
02:27:46.481 --> 02:27:48.400
<v Speaker 2>That stuff would just start tearing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking news.</v>

3329
02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:51.190
<v Speaker 2>And then once it's torn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're fucked.</v>

3330
02:27:51.250 --> 02:27:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Like your head's just rattling around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3331
02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:54.820
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scary.</v>

3332
02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend of mine,</v>

3333
02:27:55.871 --> 02:27:58.930
<v Speaker 2>a good friend of mine who's an expert in</v>
<v Speaker 2>traumatic brain injuries.</v>

3334
02:27:58.931 --> 02:28:01.600
<v Speaker 2>He's a doctor and he treats a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers,</v>

3335
02:28:01.601 --> 02:28:02.650
<v Speaker 2>football players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the like.</v>

3336
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:04.610
<v Speaker 2>And he said that you can get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>concussion,</v>

3337
02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:07.660
<v Speaker 2>a severe concussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting hit in the chest like a lot</v>

3338
02:28:07.661 --> 02:28:09.640
<v Speaker 2>of football players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had impact.</v>

3339
02:28:09.641 --> 02:28:11.590
<v Speaker 2>They get hit in the chest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

3340
02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:16.760
<v Speaker 2>that the chest snapped your head back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and your brain rattles around inside</v>

3341
02:28:18.071 --> 02:28:21.410
<v Speaker 2>your head and it gives you a massive</v>
<v Speaker 2>concussion and they,</v>

3342
02:28:21.650 --> 02:28:22.310
<v Speaker 2>the ignorant</v>

3343
02:28:22.310 --> 02:28:23.630
<v Speaker 3>people that didn't know any better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3344
02:28:23.631 --> 02:28:26.160
<v Speaker 3>ignorant as far as it didn't have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>information they would,</v>

3345
02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:26.931
<v Speaker 3>they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3346
02:28:26.931 --> 02:28:28.220
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even get hit in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fine,</v>

3347
02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:31.040
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that just getting hit in the chest.</v>

3348
02:28:31.041 --> 02:28:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Like if someone kicks you in the chest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get a concussion.</v>

3349
02:28:34.730 --> 02:28:36.260
<v Speaker 3>I hope nobody ever kicks me in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>chest.</v>

3350
02:28:36.500 --> 02:28:40.790
<v Speaker 3>I hope nobody kicks you in the chest to</v>
<v Speaker 3>not be a fan of that suck.</v>

3351
02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:45.260
<v Speaker 3>But if they did like you see your brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets fucked up.</v>

3352
02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:46.760
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had a concussion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3353
02:28:46.761 --> 02:28:49.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you're sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't know for a fact that you</v>

3354
02:28:49.491 --> 02:28:53.330
<v Speaker 3>had one piece of kickbox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So did you ever have where you were at</v>

3355
02:28:53.331 --> 02:28:54.890
<v Speaker 3>the hospital and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3356
02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:56.600
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3357
02:28:56.601 --> 02:29:00.260
<v Speaker 3>but I definitely had headaches and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>punched in the head a bunch of times.</v>

3358
02:29:00.710 --> 02:29:02.830
<v Speaker 3>I've been hit in the head a gang at</v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

3359
02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:06.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm just definitely in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing about concussions and</v>

3360
02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:09.560
<v Speaker 3>traumatic brain injury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people think that it's just a</v>

3361
02:29:09.561 --> 02:29:10.740
<v Speaker 3>concussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3362
02:29:10.741 --> 02:29:13.880
<v Speaker 3>you are concussed and defined</v>
<v Speaker 3>concussion,</v>

3363
02:29:13.940 --> 02:29:14.301
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3364
02:29:14.301 --> 02:29:16.520
<v Speaker 3>your pupils are dilated and you get hit</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the head.</v>

3365
02:29:16.930 --> 02:29:19.040
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you like small impacts,</v>

3366
02:29:19.041 --> 02:29:23.060
<v Speaker 3>repeated subconcussive impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I have the most devastating</v>

3367
02:29:23.061 --> 02:29:26.150
<v Speaker 3>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like soccer players oftentimes develop</v>

3368
02:29:26.450 --> 02:29:28.820
<v Speaker 3>the same sort of symptoms from heading</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ball.</v>

3369
02:29:28.910 --> 02:29:30.770
<v Speaker 3>Just a ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bouncing a ball off your head.</v>

3370
02:29:30.771 --> 02:29:31.604
<v Speaker 3>No concussion.</v>

3371
02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:33.000
<v Speaker 1>I would have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3372
02:29:33.510 --> 02:29:36.960
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a concussion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I assume that I've done damage from</v>

3373
02:29:37.230 --> 02:29:38.820
<v Speaker 1>surfing or wakeboarding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

3374
02:29:39.240 --> 02:29:40.160
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3375
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3376
02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:44.430
<v Speaker 1>you would know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take you a minute.</v>

3377
02:29:44.460 --> 02:29:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Like you really wipe out and you're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like laying there,</v>

3378
02:29:46.801 --> 02:29:49.590
<v Speaker 1>like</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a deep breath.</v>

3379
02:29:49.591 --> 02:29:50.221
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3380
02:29:50.221 --> 02:29:53.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to sit the next few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Mark Gordon</v>

3381
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:55.880
<v Speaker 3>was saying that you can get it from</v>
<v Speaker 3>wakeboarding or I'm not.</v>

3382
02:29:55.881 --> 02:29:57.260
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm jet skiing.</v>

3383

<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

3386
02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:04.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I'd be out on the boat or</v>

3387

3409
02:30:56.520 --> 02:30:58.590
<v Speaker 1>living on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remembering where I live.</v>

3410

<v Speaker 1>Not having somebody like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3412
02:31:04.350 --> 02:31:06.450
<v Speaker 1>well for football players you've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

3413
02:31:06.660 --> 02:31:08.610
<v Speaker 1>If you've seen the real sports episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am</v>

3414
02:31:08.690 --> 02:31:12.310
<v Speaker 3>NFL players from the seventies and</v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties that are just jobs.</v>

3415
02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one I saw,</v>

3416
02:31:15.170 --> 02:31:18.960
<v Speaker 1>it was a pbs frontline that was about</v>
<v Speaker 1>those concussions and,</v>

3417
02:31:19.410 --> 02:31:20.280
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3418
02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:23.640
<v Speaker 1>the guy's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not the same person,</v>

3419
02:31:23.820 --> 02:31:26.610
<v Speaker 1>they're just fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've just done a number on</v>

3420
02:31:26.611 --> 02:31:31.611
<v Speaker 1>their bodies and you don't bounce back</v>
<v Speaker 1>after so many just hoping that one day</v>

3421
02:31:32.251 --> 02:31:35.340
<v Speaker 1>they're going to figure out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>inject stem cells in your brain or</v>

3422
02:31:35.341 --> 02:31:38.060
<v Speaker 1>something like that to reinvigorate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

3423
02:31:38.160 --> 02:31:40.020
<v Speaker 1>as of right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really can't do much.</v>

3424
02:31:40.060 --> 02:31:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Are you a football fan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really,</v>

3425

02:31:42.781 --> 02:31:43.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

3427
02:31:43.880 --> 02:31:47.910
<v Speaker 1>you think about you'd see a big hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would make this know wide world of</v>

3428
02:31:47.911 --> 02:31:49.530
<v Speaker 1>sports real or some shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

3429
02:31:50.210 --> 02:31:51.960
<v Speaker 1>do you want to watch it again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just insane.</v>

3430
02:31:51.961 --> 02:31:53.190
<v Speaker 1>And everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3431
02:31:53.191 --> 02:31:55.710
<v Speaker 1>and they're fucking and now I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3432
02:31:56.640 --> 02:31:58.890

<v Speaker 1>old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3434
02:32:00.040 --> 02:32:04.090
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's probably lost however many lost</v>

3435
02:32:04.170 --> 02:32:07.350
<v Speaker 1>whatever function of his brain that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>say is like your emotions and your</v>

3436
02:32:07.351 --> 02:32:09.930
<v Speaker 1>decision making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why a lot of those guys will</v>

3437
02:32:10.260 --> 02:32:13.560
<v Speaker 1>shoot their girlfriend killed themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to show one jamie.</v>

02:32:16.290 --> 02:32:17.123
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

02:32:17.240 --> 02:32:20.230
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

3441
02:32:21.530 --> 02:32:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was two weeks ago.</v>

3442
02:32:23.390 --> 02:32:25.670
<v Speaker 1>You can tell the knockout when the hand</v>
<v Speaker 1>stamp.</v>

3443
02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3444
02:32:27.210 --> 02:32:28.260
<v Speaker 3>believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

3445
02:32:28.410 --> 02:32:30.300
<v Speaker 3>I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've probably seen more people get</v>

3446
02:32:30.301 --> 02:32:35.230
<v Speaker 3>knocked unconscious in real life then I</v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

3447
02:32:35.330 --> 02:32:37.140
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would really,</v>

3448
02:32:37.170 --> 02:32:42.170
<v Speaker 3>without any reservation say that I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>seen more people get knocked out then</v>

3449
02:32:44.960 --> 02:32:46.590
<v Speaker 3>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>zero point one,</v>

3450
02:32:46.591 --> 02:32:48.080
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one percent of the population.</v>

3451
02:32:48.081 --> 02:32:51.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm like in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the smallest group of people,</v>

3452
02:32:52.320 --> 02:32:57.320
<v Speaker 3>like there's maybe a hundred or 200</v>
<v Speaker 3>people on the planet that have seen more</v>

3453
02:32:57.421 --> 02:32:59.070
<v Speaker 3>people get knocked out than me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe</v>

3454
02:32:59.980 --> 02:33:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people get knocked out not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that extent,</v>

3455
02:33:03.131 --> 02:33:07.210
<v Speaker 1>but because of my sports producer I used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have to actually go to all the games.</v>

3456
02:33:07.390 --> 02:33:08.690
<v Speaker 1>So I'd be on the sideline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3457
02:33:08.760 --> 02:33:11.200
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I saw it,</v>

3458
02:33:11.201 --> 02:33:12.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right there up close.</v>

3459
02:33:12.431 --> 02:33:14.840
<v Speaker 1>And it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you just see it coming.</v>

3460
02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:17.740
<v Speaker 1>You could see the guy coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see his head turned the other</v>

3461
02:33:17.741 --> 02:33:19.690
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has no idea what's you know,</v>

3462
02:33:19.900 --> 02:33:23.020
<v Speaker 1>and then the moment he just lays down</v>
<v Speaker 1>those arms just oh yeah,</v>

3463
02:33:23.110 --> 02:33:24.110
<v Speaker 1>they just stay up until like</v>

3464
02:33:24.430 --> 02:33:26.200
<v Speaker 3>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well because of doing commentary for the</v>

3465
02:33:26.201 --> 02:33:28.930
<v Speaker 3>UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean literally I've seen more</v>

3466
02:33:28.931 --> 02:33:32.620
<v Speaker 3>knockouts than way more than 99 percent</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the population.</v>

3467
02:33:32.980 --> 02:33:34.850
<v Speaker 3>It's probably like 99 point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>

3468
02:33:34.860 --> 02:33:35.693
<v Speaker 3>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine.</v>

3469
02:33:35.800 --> 02:33:38.440
<v Speaker 3>There might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there might be 20 people on earth that</v>

3470
02:33:38.441 --> 02:33:40.030
<v Speaker 3>have seen more people get knocked out</v>
<v Speaker 3>than me.</v>

3471
02:33:40.031 --> 02:33:42.970
<v Speaker 3>It might really be that low because how</v>
<v Speaker 3>long have you been doing that?</v>

3472
02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:45.940
<v Speaker 3>I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started doing the commentary from 97</v>

3473
02:33:46.420 --> 02:33:50.640
<v Speaker 3>and I started again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it from 97 and 98.</v>

3474
02:33:50.690 --> 02:33:54.070
<v Speaker 3>Then I quit and then came back in 2002</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the new company and I've been doing</v>

3475
02:33:54.071 --> 02:33:56.980
<v Speaker 3>it for the last 14 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you've seen a lot of.</v>

3476
02:33:57.090 --> 02:34:00.760
<v Speaker 3>But I also was fighting from the time I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was 15,</v>

3477
02:34:00.910 --> 02:34:05.590
<v Speaker 3>so was 15 to 22 was all kick boxing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts.</v>

3478
02:34:05.740 --> 02:34:10.300
<v Speaker 3>So I saw a lot of people get knocked out</v>
<v Speaker 3>in person there and then I saw was just</v>

3479
02:34:10.420 --> 02:34:12.050
<v Speaker 3>fucking done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God called like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's way more than a thousand fights.</v>

3481
02:34:15.640 --> 02:34:20.640
<v Speaker 3>It's probably close to 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've probably seen five or 600 people</v>

3482
02:34:22.121 --> 02:34:25.650
<v Speaker 3>just get shut off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just wham.</v>

<v Speaker 3>toes curled.</v>

3486
02:34:32.681 --> 02:34:35.200

<v Speaker 3>200,</v>

3487

<v Speaker 3>300 times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>When you really stop,</v>

3489
02:34:39.180 --> 02:34:42.750
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's weird that like going from</v>

3490
02:34:42.751 --> 02:34:44.910
<v Speaker 1>something I would watch and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3491
02:34:45.030 --> 02:34:46.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch it again to like,</v>

3492
02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:48.510
<v Speaker 1>now I'm just going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeez,</v>

3494
02:34:51.160 --> 02:34:52.500
<v Speaker 1>We're getting old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun anymore.</v>

3495
02:34:52.530 --> 02:34:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

3496
02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:56.920
<v Speaker 3>becoming more and more aware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And plus like the knew will smith movie</v>

3497
02:34:56.950 --> 02:35:01.950
<v Speaker 3>concussions coming out where people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting to say no I haven't.</v>

3498
02:35:02.111 --> 02:35:02.820
<v Speaker 3>Is it out already?</v>

3499
02:35:02.820 --> 02:35:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Came on over Christmas,</v>

3500
02:35:04.420 --> 02:35:08.490
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think what it should have.</v>

3501
02:35:08.860 --> 02:35:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read something that there was like</v>

3502
02:35:10.831 --> 02:35:14.820
<v Speaker 1>this long thing of discrepancies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they chose to leave out because</v>

3503
02:35:14.821 --> 02:35:16.020
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be a true story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3504
02:35:16.021 --> 02:35:16.560
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

3505
02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:20.370
<v Speaker 1>they admitted very important facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>

3506
02:35:20.371 --> 02:35:24.990
<v Speaker 1>because of the nfl of how they treated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3507
02:35:24.991 --> 02:35:28.360
<v Speaker 1>like there are certain things that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know who got behind what and like</v>

3508
02:35:28.380 --> 02:35:32.460
<v Speaker 1>who kind of strong arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong arm them into like doing what</v>

3509
02:35:33.060 --> 02:35:36.090
<v Speaker 1>leave that part out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that part in or maybe try to avoid</v>

3510
02:35:36.091 --> 02:35:40.620
<v Speaker 1>lawsuits to something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean I used to think when I would</v>

3511
02:35:40.621 --> 02:35:42.990
<v Speaker 1>hear people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I grew up in Texas too,</v>

3512
02:35:42.991 --> 02:35:46.500
<v Speaker 1>so football was such a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how there would be people that would</v>

3513
02:35:46.501 --> 02:35:47.011
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3514
02:35:47.011 --> 02:35:48.900
<v Speaker 1>I'd never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not letting my son play football and</v>

3515
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:53.040
<v Speaker 1>your pussy and I get it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't have kids,</v>

3516
02:35:53.041 --> 02:35:55.920
<v Speaker 1>but I would say I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you see the results in these</v>

3517
02:35:55.921 --> 02:35:57.360
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just fogged.</v>

3518
02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:58.870
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3519
02:35:59.510 --> 02:36:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Well I mean if boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if my kids wanted to fight,</v>

3520
02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:06.370
<v Speaker 3>I would be very conservative about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to.</v>

3521
02:36:06.670 --> 02:36:10.660
<v Speaker 3>I'd have to really try to get it into</v>
<v Speaker 3>their head to understand defense before</v>

3522
02:36:10.661 --> 02:36:13.060
<v Speaker 3>anything really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to like the most important</v>

3523
02:36:13.061 --> 02:36:15.760
<v Speaker 3>thing to practice is learning how to</v>
<v Speaker 3>avoid being hit and how to.</v>

3524
02:36:15.970 --> 02:36:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I took like,</v>

3525
02:36:17.370 --> 02:36:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I took karate as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

3526
02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.040
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad was like,</v>

3527
02:36:21.041 --> 02:36:22.300
<v Speaker 1>you never start a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3528
02:36:22.301 --> 02:36:24.220
<v Speaker 1>but if somebody ever tried to hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

3529
02:36:24.221 --> 02:36:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just punched him right in the nose and</v>

3530
02:36:26.201 --> 02:36:29.410
<v Speaker 1>keep doing it until like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but defend yourself,</v>

3531
02:36:29.411 --> 02:36:30.490
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3532
02:36:30.491 --> 02:36:33.620

<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3533
02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:35.620
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3534
02:36:35.660 --> 02:36:38.200
<v Speaker 1>well avoiding fights is always to get in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fight.</v>

3535
02:36:39.390 --> 02:36:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Don't hit me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be so upset.</v>

3536
02:36:42.230 --> 02:36:45.820
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well just if you didn't avoid it and you</v>

3537
02:36:45.821 --> 02:36:47.590
<v Speaker 1>got hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>badly hurt.</v>

02:36:47.620 --> 02:36:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And something you could have avoided it</v>

3539
02:36:49.450 --> 02:36:51.520
<v Speaker 1>feel so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have been forever.</v>

3540
02:36:51.670 --> 02:36:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you're the one that started it and</v>

3541
02:36:53.021 --> 02:36:55.960
<v Speaker 1>then you get the shit kicked out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cooler heads.</v>

3542
02:36:55.961 --> 02:36:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Prevail is always a good thing to focus</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

3543
02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:01.420
<v Speaker 1>It's just sad.</v>

3544
02:37:02.010 --> 02:37:04.660
<v Speaker 3>It's almost always whatever the fuck it</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that people fight over,</v>

3545
02:37:04.661 --> 02:37:06.370
<v Speaker 3>it's almost always going to be worked</v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

3546
02:37:06.790 --> 02:37:10.570
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People just want to fight when they're</v>

3547
02:37:10.571 --> 02:37:14.470
<v Speaker 3>drunk and that's the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>alcohol and pot.</v>

3548
02:37:14.740 --> 02:37:16.610
<v Speaker 3>Nobody fought at the Cannabis Cup,</v>

3549
02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:20.330
<v Speaker 2>those fucking people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even had a fight that day.</v>

3550
02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:25.170
<v Speaker 2>I want to just grab it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just slowly answer for say,</v>

3551
02:37:25.990 --> 02:37:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slow dance me and you man talk.</v>

3552
02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to tell you about,</v>

3553
02:37:30.980 --> 02:37:34.770
<v Speaker 2>but let's talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck the people come out of a bar to</v>

3554
02:37:35.930 --> 02:37:38.180
<v Speaker 2>fire it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the worst drug when it comes to</v>

3555
02:37:38.181 --> 02:37:39.014
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worst,</v>

3556
02:37:39.300 --> 02:37:43.040
<v Speaker 2>the worst job because it narrows your</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the danger that you're</v>

3557
02:37:43.041 --> 02:37:47.630
<v Speaker 2>involved in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loosens inhibition impedes rational</v>

3558
02:37:47.631 --> 02:37:51.290
<v Speaker 2>thinking and it's always somebody that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fucking hammered,</v>

3559
02:37:51.760 --> 02:37:53.570
<v Speaker 2>but they can't even put one foot in</v>
<v Speaker 2>front of the other,</v>

3560
02:37:53.571 --> 02:37:58.040
<v Speaker 2>but in their mind they're seeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>something completely different and they</v>

3561
02:37:58.041 --> 02:37:59.750
<v Speaker 2>always end up getting the shit knocked</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of them.</v>

3562
02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:02.270
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen it a bunch of times.</v>

3563
02:38:02.300 --> 02:38:04.210
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's seen.</v>

3564
02:38:04.250 --> 02:38:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Street fights is always so strange too</v>
<v Speaker 2>because sometimes you see street fights</v>

3565
02:38:07.581 --> 02:38:10.760
<v Speaker 2>with people that are so confident and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they literally have no idea how to fight</v>

3566
02:38:10.790 --> 02:38:11.900
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you so?</v>

3567
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:13.320
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even.</v>

3568
02:38:13.410 --> 02:38:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they beat up somebody that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>really scrawny.</v>

3569
02:38:16.930 --> 02:38:20.570
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to happen to get that good</v>

3570
02:38:20.690 --> 02:38:23.240
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that big giant bouncer.</v>

3571
02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:28.360
<v Speaker 2>I got this and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always want to like if you ever met</v>

3572
02:38:28.521 --> 02:38:31.640
<v Speaker 2>someone that like they become a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different person when they get drunk,</v>

3573
02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:33.970
<v Speaker 2>they drink and then like a switch goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

3574
02:38:33.971 --> 02:38:34.641
<v Speaker 2>If they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3575
02:38:34.641 --> 02:38:36.230
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Jenny go with Jenny,</v>

3576
02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Jenny in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those eyes are just like,</v>

3577
02:38:38.460 --> 02:38:41.540
<v Speaker 2>they get gerbils,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hamsters and then you say something,</v>

3578
02:38:41.610 --> 02:38:44.450
<v Speaker 2>then it's usually the people that get</v>
<v Speaker 2>mad really easily.</v>

3579
02:38:45.230 --> 02:38:49.550
<v Speaker 2>We were just having fun like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well fuck this shit,</v>

3580
02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:51.860
<v Speaker 2>fuck this fuck of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And was looking at me.</v>

3581
02:38:51.890 --> 02:38:53.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because your drink's empty.</v>

3582
02:38:53.120 --> 02:38:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell happened to you?</v>

3583
02:38:56.540 --> 02:38:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Where'd you go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of amazing that.</v>

3584
02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:01.070
<v Speaker 2>So few fights do take place.</v>

3585
02:39:01.070 --> 02:39:04.130
<v Speaker 2>When you think about how much alcohol is</v>
<v Speaker 2>available and how many people drink,</v>

3586
02:39:04.190 --> 02:39:06.860
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of amazing when you go out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't see a fight,</v>

3587
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:08.710
<v Speaker 2>which is more often than not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3588
02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:12.110
<v Speaker 2>Depends on where you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when I was in Austin,</v>

3589
02:39:12.111 --> 02:39:14.390
<v Speaker 2>so you've got on sixth street and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>good place.</v>

3590
02:39:15.530 --> 02:39:18.200
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be weird to not see a fight on</v>

3591
02:39:18.201 --> 02:39:20.930
<v Speaker 2>sixth street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then if you go to a place that's</v>

3592
02:39:20.931 --> 02:39:21.800
<v Speaker 2>like a nicer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3593
02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:24.890
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are adults instead of a bunch of</v>

3594
02:39:24.891 --> 02:39:29.150
<v Speaker 2>just college kids that are ripped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see as many,</v>

3595
02:39:29.151 --> 02:39:31.400
<v Speaker 2>but that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw a lot in Austin.</v>

3596
02:39:31.401 --> 02:39:33.380
<v Speaker 2>That was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty common.</v>

3597
02:39:33.690 --> 02:39:36.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>college towns and then you got Texas</v>

3598
02:39:36.771 --> 02:39:39.620
<v Speaker 2>people and then he got booze and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw it all together.</v>

3599
02:39:40.130 --> 02:39:41.600
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fucking Johan.</v>

3600
02:39:43.780 --> 02:39:45.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a great town though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love great town.</v>

3601
02:39:46.100 --> 02:39:48.110
<v Speaker 2>A town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's getting choked up with people</v>

3602
02:39:48.111 --> 02:39:50.150
<v Speaker 2>though these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to live there now.</v>

3603
02:39:50.210 --> 02:39:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't know.</v>

3604
02:39:52.460 --> 02:39:55.430
<v Speaker 2>It's cool as shit to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a nice place.</v>

3605
02:39:55.431 --> 02:39:56.920
<v Speaker 2>That was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

3606
02:39:56.921 --> 02:39:58.330
<v Speaker 2>it's a good atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

3607
02:39:58.331 --> 02:40:00.500
<v Speaker 2>I think it's laid back that help</v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic.</v>

3608
02:40:00.501 --> 02:40:01.450
<v Speaker 2>There's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3609
02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:04.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's started becoming like just.</v>

3610
02:40:04.120 --> 02:40:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's overwhelming.</v>

3611
02:40:05.720 --> 02:40:08.720
<v Speaker 2>Their infrastructure can't really handle</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because it's not designed for that</v>

3612
02:40:08.721 --> 02:40:11.600
<v Speaker 2>many people and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything's consistently under</v>

3613
02:40:11.720 --> 02:40:13.860
<v Speaker 2>construction that never get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3614
02:40:13.861 --> 02:40:16.410
<v Speaker 2>it's just like everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just,</v>

3615
02:40:16.470 --> 02:40:18.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all going gonna be a new</v>

3616
02:40:18.841 --> 02:40:20.060
<v Speaker 2>building that's going to be it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3617
02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:22.230
<v Speaker 2>So we have to close that street off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that straight offs.</v>

3618
02:40:22.530 --> 02:40:23.610
<v Speaker 2>Traffic's now worse.</v>

3619
02:40:26.020 --> 02:40:30.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is a very unique city in Texas</v>

3620
02:40:30.391 --> 02:40:33.240
<v Speaker 2>too because it's got its own vibe to it</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to.</v>

3621
02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:35.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the capital,</v>

3622
02:40:35.490 --> 02:40:38.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's got its own vibe to it that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>different than any other Texas city.</v>

3623
02:40:38.641 --> 02:40:41.190
<v Speaker 2>It's so liberal and open minded and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweared.</v>

3624
02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:46.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that like I worked</v>
<v Speaker 2>downtown and where the office,</v>

3625
02:40:46.980 --> 02:40:49.500
<v Speaker 2>where our station was was right there</v>
<v Speaker 2>next to the capital,</v>

3626
02:40:49.740 --> 02:40:51.870
<v Speaker 2>so it was kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was on Congress and you could walk</v>

3627
02:40:51.871 --> 02:40:52.704
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

3628
02:40:52.770 --> 02:40:55.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't live very far.</v>

3629
02:40:55.171 --> 02:40:58.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was still young so I had a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little cool dope ass little high rise,</v>

3630
02:40:58.511 --> 02:41:00.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was fun,</v>

3631
02:41:00.630 --> 02:41:03.960
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like every time I go back it's</v>

3632
02:41:03.961 --> 02:41:06.660
<v Speaker 2>just thousands more people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3633
02:41:07.020 --> 02:41:10.470
<v Speaker 2>We'll do some nutty number of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>move there every day.</v>

3634
02:41:10.950 --> 02:41:13.500
<v Speaker 2>It was like a thousand people moved</v>
<v Speaker 2>there everyday or something like that.</v>

3635
02:41:13.510 --> 02:41:15.930
<v Speaker 2>Something insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something really ridiculous.</v>

3636
02:41:15.931 --> 02:41:19.590
<v Speaker 2>And it is sprawling because you can go</v>
<v Speaker 2>out towards the lakes and all those kind</v>

3637
02:41:19.591 --> 02:41:21.550
<v Speaker 2>of houses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people move to Austin every</v>

3638
02:41:21.551 --> 02:41:22.384
<v Speaker 2>day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google that.</v>

3639
02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:24.990
<v Speaker 2>I bet there's a statistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

3640
02:41:24.991 --> 02:41:27.510
<v Speaker 2>by the lake will the lakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to be two lakes,</v>

3641
02:41:27.511 --> 02:41:28.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lake Austin,</v>

3642
02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:32.640
<v Speaker 2>Lake Travis and Lake Travis had fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>become nothing but there was town lake</v>

3643
02:41:32.670 --> 02:41:34.680
<v Speaker 2>and then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like travis is now,</v>

3644
02:41:34.681 --> 02:41:37.740
<v Speaker 2>like just speed boats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody filled up again.</v>

3645
02:41:37.770 --> 02:41:40.260
<v Speaker 2>It was down to nothing and it rained so</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

3646
02:41:40.261 --> 02:41:43.320
<v Speaker 2>It filled back up again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was pretty fucked up because nobody</v>

3647
02:41:43.321 --> 02:41:46.560
<v Speaker 2>could even get in the water due to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria.</v>

3648
02:41:46.561 --> 02:41:48.450
<v Speaker 2>It's only 110.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 50.</v>

3649
02:41:49.770 --> 02:41:52.080
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing.</v>

3650
02:41:53.330 --> 02:41:55.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when for 2014.</v>

3651
02:41:56.640 --> 02:42:01.200
<v Speaker 2>So two years ago,</v>
