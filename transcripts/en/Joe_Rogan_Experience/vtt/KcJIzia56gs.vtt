00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.570
<v Speaker 2>If we go back to 10,000,</v>

3
00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:06.710
<v Speaker 2>12,000 years ago,</v>

4
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:11.660
<v Speaker 2>clearly whatever happened then must've been profoundly traumatic to the</v>

5
00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:12.500
<v Speaker 2>survivors.</v>

6
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.611
<v Speaker 2>Think about this.</v>

7
00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:18.611
<v Speaker 2>If you were the survivor of an event that basically erased modern civilization</v>

8
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.810
<v Speaker 2>and you are living in a small isolated band of survivors with no way to</v>

9
00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:27.560
<v Speaker 2>communicate with the rest of the world and no knowledge of whether there was</v>

10
00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.870
<v Speaker 2>even other survivors anywhere on the earth.</v>

11
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.300
<v Speaker 2>It could profoundly affect your,</v>

12
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.541
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

13
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:32.751
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

14
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:37.751
<v Speaker 2>your consciousness and and that could be so profound that it's the imprint of</v>

15
00:00:38.511 --> 00:00:41.570
<v Speaker 2>those events can be so profound and it could be passed on</v>

16
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.640
<v Speaker 2>for generations and and be lodged in our subconscious.</v>

17
00:00:46.641 --> 00:00:51.350
<v Speaker 2>This idea of human conflict necessary for human survival and the traumas that</v>

18
00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.290
<v Speaker 2>had been visited upon our species by nature itself.</v>

19
00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.030
<v Speaker 2>So I think that once we come to terms with the possibly origins of only until we</v>

20
00:01:02.211 --> 00:01:04.580
<v Speaker 2>come to terms with the origin of human conflict,</v>

21
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.940
<v Speaker 2>are we going to be able to purge it once and for all?</v>

22
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.600
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

23
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.600
<v Speaker 2>and realize that that the modern analog for that scenario was that coming out of</v>

24
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:17.420
<v Speaker 2>that catastrophe.</v>

25
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Abundant resources,</v>

26
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.301
<v Speaker 2>abundance,</v>

27
00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:21.050
<v Speaker 2>habitat,</v>

28
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.070
<v Speaker 2>abundant space,</v>

29
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.020
<v Speaker 2>no conflict for territory or resources because the human population was limited.</v>

30
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.180
<v Speaker 2>What I suggest is that if people want to understand the viable future of the</v>

31
00:01:32.181 --> 00:01:33.140
<v Speaker 2>human species,</v>

32
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.030
<v Speaker 2>go out on a crystal clear night and look at the sky.</v>

33
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.920
<v Speaker 2>There is the future.</v>

34
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.790
<v Speaker 2>There's our potential future because the scenario is that had been around since</v>

35
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:48.650
<v Speaker 2>the 1970 show that everything that we're extracting now from the earth,</v>

36
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.910
<v Speaker 2>the minerals,</v>

37
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.470
<v Speaker 2>the precious metals,</v>

38
00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:52.490
<v Speaker 2>the hydrocarbons,</v>

39
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.830
<v Speaker 2>it's all out there in infinite abundance and it's basically just outside of our</v>

40
00:01:57.831 --> 00:01:58.664
<v Speaker 2>doorstep.</v>

41
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 2>And we are as close now to being able to harvest the resources of the cosmic</v>

42
00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:08.740
<v Speaker 2>environment as we were from setting foot on the moon in 1960.</v>

43
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:09.040
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

44
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.701
<v Speaker 1>nick and nate,</v>

45
00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:12.310
<v Speaker 1>they get a painted to be these bad guys and you know,</v>

46
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.550
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the persona that they promote,</v>

47
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.820
<v Speaker 1>that that's all well and good.</v>

48
00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:17.260
<v Speaker 1>But like they're very,</v>

49
00:02:17.261 --> 00:02:17.971
<v Speaker 1>very respectable.</v>

50
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:18.251
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

51
00:02:18.251 --> 00:02:18.491
<v Speaker 1>when he,</v>

52
00:02:18.491 --> 00:02:19.324
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.730
<v Speaker 1>when Nick beat Frank Shamrock,</v>

54
00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:24.850
<v Speaker 1>he was on the ground after the fight and nick reached down and picked him up and</v>

55
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:25.190
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

56
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.081
<v Speaker 1>you're a legend.</v>

58
00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:26.831
<v Speaker 1>You can't be on the floor,</v>

59
00:02:26.831 --> 00:02:27.670
<v Speaker 1>stand up or whatever.</v>

60
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

61
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.223
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

62
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.980
<v Speaker 1>but all the people see is they go for the stare down at the press conference.</v>

63
00:02:32.981 --> 00:02:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Netflix,</v>

64
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm off and frank shamrock grabs his balls,</v>

65
00:02:35.141 --> 00:02:37.570
<v Speaker 1>but they're both very respectful fighters in the,</v>

66
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.730
<v Speaker 1>I think they get,</v>

68
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.900
<v Speaker 1>they get a bad rap sometimes.</v>

69
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

70
00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:45.100
<v Speaker 1>he definitely gets crazy before the fight and anxious and.</v>

71
00:02:45.101 --> 00:02:48.070
<v Speaker 1>But that's to be expected and the shit talking.</v>

72
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Look sunsuit set it and the art of war,</v>

73
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.690
<v Speaker 1>a multi Musashi talked about it in the book of five rings did.</v>

75
00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of things that go on in the fight and in contest there's</v>

76
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>advantages to be had and there's a mental advantages that if you do not take</v>

77
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>advantage of those mental advantages and your opponent does,</v>

78
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 1>you're at a disadvantage.</v>

79
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.610
<v Speaker 1>And when nick immediately starts the fight and he's like,</v>

80
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.340
<v Speaker 1>he's got his hands out to Anderson,</v>

81
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 1>like what Bitch,</v>

82
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.801
<v Speaker 1>what pitch?</v>

83
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>And he's walking towards him.</v>

84
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.181
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

85

<v Speaker 1>And you see him talking,</v>

89
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>like constantly talking and you just see Anderson,</v>

90
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:24.500
<v Speaker 1>like people get flustered when nick does that mean,</v>

91
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>so it does it in sparring to tell the really high.</v>

92
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>That's the first time I met Nicole was brought in for actually the,</v>

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.010
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

148
00:04:40.011 --> 00:04:43.160
<v Speaker 3>whenever I hear people say that this has nothing to do with religion,</v>

149
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.440
<v Speaker 3>it just doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

150
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.970
<v Speaker 3>Is that like an American liberal convenient thing to say because it makes you</v>

151
00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:53.160
<v Speaker 3>look super sensitive and very noam Chomsky ask?</v>

152
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.140
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah it does.</v>

153
00:04:54.141 --> 00:04:55.950
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a um,</v>

154
00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what goes into it.</v>

155
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.390
<v Speaker 3>I know that there's a lot of fear and you know,</v>

156
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 3>people don't want to criticize this,</v>

157
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

158
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

159
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.740
<v Speaker 3>we saw what happened with someone or I stayed all the way up to the Paris</v>

160
00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:07.574
<v Speaker 3>attacks.</v>

161
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.180
<v Speaker 3>So there is a fear of that and there's also a fear of being seen as a bigot.</v>

162
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.603
<v Speaker 3>That was Brian.</v>

163
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.600
<v Speaker 3>I call it Islamophobia Phobia.</v>

164
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:16.503
<v Speaker 3>People are like,</v>

165
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.950
<v Speaker 3>great word and you know,</v>

166
00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:19.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm a phobia phobia.</v>

167
00:05:19.941 --> 00:05:20.774
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

168
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.590
<v Speaker 3>It's something that a lot of people relate to immediately trigger it.</v>

169
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.610
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

170
00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:26.630
<v Speaker 3>I hate that term.</v>

171
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.560
<v Speaker 3>Islamophobia.</v>

172
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.430
<v Speaker 3>And look,</v>

173
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.810
<v Speaker 3>what about Christian have phobia.</v>

174
00:05:29.811 --> 00:05:33.800
<v Speaker 3>What's hilarious to me is that a lot of quote unquote progressive,</v>

175
00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:37.040
<v Speaker 3>very left wing people will openly mock Christianity.</v>

176
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

177
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.460
<v Speaker 3>While defending Islam or by labeling people Islamophobic who conservative.</v>

178
00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

179
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

180
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.010
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

181
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.530
<v Speaker 3>you gotta you gotta stay consistent.</v>

182
00:05:45.531 --> 00:05:46.820
<v Speaker 3>If you're a true liberal,</v>

183
00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Speaker 3>and I know everybody's saying this,</v>

184
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.371
<v Speaker 3>well unfortunately,</v>

185
00:05:49.371 --> 00:05:50.470
<v Speaker 3>not everybody's saying it.</v>

186
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.650
<v Speaker 3>I wish more people were saying it,</v>

187
00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:52.430
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

188
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.263
<v Speaker 3>if you are,</v>

189
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.781
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

190
00:05:53.781 --> 00:05:55.760
<v Speaker 3>opposed to killing gay people,</v>

191
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 3>you should be opposed killing baby gay people.</v>

192
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:03.101
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's in the KKK manifesto or the Bible or the Koran,</v>

193
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 3>or in the Republican Party,</v>

194
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

195
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.050
<v Speaker 3>or in Uganda,</v>

196
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter what it is,</v>

197
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 3>if you're opposed to something you should be opposed to it across the board.</v>

198
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't suddenly become respectful that,</v>

199
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:13.911
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

200
00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:14.300
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

201
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.021
<v Speaker 3>well it's in the Bible,</v>

202
00:06:15.021 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 3>so we got to respect that.</v>

203
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 3>Know and it's respect for ideas is just such an overrated.</v>

204
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 3>It's considered a virtue,</v>

205
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:23.961
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

206
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:27.840
<v Speaker 3>respecting people's ideas and beliefs and ideas are not people you know,</v>

207
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:28.620
<v Speaker 3>like that's,</v>

208
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 3>and I was trying to,</v>

209
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.100
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem with the word Islamophobia is that it implies criticism of an</v>

210
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:37.670
<v Speaker 3>idea and there is genuine anti Muslim bigotry.</v>

211
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 3>People do commit hate crimes against Muslims,</v>

212
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 3>but Muslims are people.</v>

213
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:43.580
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

214
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.310
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>

215
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're entitled to respect,</v>

216
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:46.640
<v Speaker 3>they have rights.</v>

217
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.280
<v Speaker 3>Islam itself is not a person.</v>

218
00:06:48.281 --> 00:06:48.930
<v Speaker 3>It's just a,</v>

219
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:49.701
<v Speaker 3>it's a book.</v>

220
00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:50.690
<v Speaker 3>It's an ideology.</v>

221
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.470
<v Speaker 3>It's an ideology,</v>

222
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of ideas in a book.</v>

223
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't have rights and it's not entitled to respect.</v>

224
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.681
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

225
00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:56.011
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

226
00:06:56.011 --> 00:06:56.460
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

227
00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.460
