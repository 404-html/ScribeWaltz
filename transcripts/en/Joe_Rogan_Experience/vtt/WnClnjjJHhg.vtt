00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Five four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Donny Vincent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>How are you buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very excited that you didn't know about</v>

6
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>floating at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know about float tanks even</v>

7
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>remotely until you came here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's wicked looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun,</v>

9
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've got time after the show,</v>

10
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>you can float.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to do it,</v>

11
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.630
<v Speaker 1>I might have to do it just to say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it.</v>

12
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

13
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know the science behind it</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than obviously floating right.</v>

14
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.150
<v Speaker 1>just feels good just to meditate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to sit there in a quiet,</v>

16
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:36.931
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a little kid and you go on a</v>

18
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>swimming pool or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put your ears just under the water</v>

19
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>and you get that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

20
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>When everything's just peaceful and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can just sit there and you can't hear</v>

21
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>your mother or you can't hear your</v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend or whatever and it's just</v>

22
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>quiet.</v>

23
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 1>I assume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot like that.</v>

24
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.970
<v Speaker 1>It's very telling me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said to women,</v>

25
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>you didn't say your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't see your grandpa.</v>

26
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.840
<v Speaker 1>My Dad never talked to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's a whole nother subject.</v>

27
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.480
<v Speaker 1>That's another part of the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>

28
00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:59.783
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

29
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>I am trying to get floating spread</v>
<v Speaker 1>across where like this is the best way</v>

30
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>for people to relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does nothing like it because first of</v>

31
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>all physically you're relaxed because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water has so much epson salts in it</v>

32
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just really good for your muscles.</v>

33
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.570
<v Speaker 1>It's good for sore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sore muscles overworked.</v>

35
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.710
<v Speaker 1>It's great for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also great in the environment</v>

36
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were in that tank with total</v>

37
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>darkness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>total silence.</v>

38
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>It's pitch black in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You close the door,</v>

39
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>you don't see a ray of light and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ears are underwater.</v>

40
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>And then I have to get some earplugs for</v>
<v Speaker 1>guests.</v>

41
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind having the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

42
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>the salt in my ears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people get a little weirded out</v>

43
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>by the salt in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we have as women that,</v>

44
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:43.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I buy,</v>

45
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.240
<v Speaker 1>I bought a big thing of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

46
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>My memory's fucked up dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with me?</v>

47
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about all giant jug of it.</v>

48
00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

49
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing is that it just gives</v>

50
00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:58.640
<v Speaker 1>you a lone time in a way that you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever get when you're floating in there.</v>

51
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>You're not thinking about your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 1>thinking about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just,</v>

53
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 1>you're just floating and then it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>very peaceful,</v>

54
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>just a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What makes you,</v>

55
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a real moment to consider</v>

56
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had made some of my best decisions</v>

57
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:14.250
<v Speaker 1>in that thing and I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously we all know the rat</v>

58
00:02:14.251 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>race right now.</v>

59
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.080
<v Speaker 1>None of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

60
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>it's why I go to the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

61
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Like they're just sitting there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>peace in my mind has been doing this for</v>

62
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>years where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 1>early on in and when I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm going in the Arctic,</v>

64
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>or early on when I'd go into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains or something like that,</v>

65
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>everything was frantic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I had to do things really quickly.</v>

66
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to cover a lot of ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to,</v>

67
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>packing,</v>

68
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>moving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was so frantic.</v>

69
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>And then when I started realizing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I would just stop and slow down and</v>

70
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>look at the very tiniest details around</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

71
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>no matter where I was or who I was with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I started having a great</v>

72
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:52.680
<v Speaker 1>appreciation of my presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sure something like that is just</v>

73
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.720
<v Speaker 1>because of the darkness and because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the floating,</v>

74
00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:59.721
<v Speaker 1>it's just hyper extended into that</v>
<v Speaker 1>presence of you can trick yourself into</v>

75
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>thinking that nothing else is going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>

76
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

77
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we take this attitude that</v>

78
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>we have in the city when you're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with traffic and massive amounts of</v>

79
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>people and you sort of have that same</v>
<v Speaker 1>momentum when you go into the mountains</v>

80
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>and if you do do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to appreciate it the</v>

81
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

82
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look around.</v>

83
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that for a few years.</v>

84
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 1>I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I had to accomplish something.</v>

85
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 1>So I'd go to site a and hunt there then</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I tried to,</v>

86
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.260
<v Speaker 1>as horrible as the sentences to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to kill as fast as I could so I</v>

87
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>could get out of there and go to site B</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sight see.</v>

88
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>And then I started realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually had a friend of mine,</v>

89
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:39.941
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

90
00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 1>I think you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're hunting too much.</v>

91
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>I think this is going to catch up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you're going to,</v>

92
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>the experience is going to start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>degrade for you.</v>

93
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was almost like I was trying to</v>

94
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>accomplish really fast goals and when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started slowing that down and saying,</v>

95
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go to the Arctic for</v>

96
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 1>seven days and try to knock all of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things off my list in seven days.</v>

97
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to the Arctic for 30 days</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now let the Arctic come to me.</v>

98
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Let Let.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I just want to sit still and be</v>

99
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:09.580
<v Speaker 1>quiet and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not chase the Arctic down,</v>

100
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 1>but I want it just now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it to come to me.</v>

101
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Well I think people for the La people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't have any experience in the</v>

102
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>outdoors and certainly people who don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt don't understand it and their</v>

103
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>version of it they're getting either</v>
<v Speaker 1>from movies were hunters are always</v>

104
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.080
<v Speaker 1>portrayed as villains or they're getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>it from these outdoor TV shows,</v>

105
00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.410
<v Speaker 1>which I don't think a good do a good job</v>
<v Speaker 1>of representing what it actually is.</v>

106
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.420
<v Speaker 1>Even the really good ones like Rinella</v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

107
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>which I think is the best show out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

108
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>it's still 22 minutes with commercials</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just don't think that you get a</v>

109
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 1>real sense of what it's like what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you did.</v>

110
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why I wanted to have you on.</v>

111
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 1>As you're doing films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're doing an hour long film</v>

112
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.230
<v Speaker 1>about a hunt and in that you really get</v>
<v Speaker 1>an understanding of the environment.</v>

113
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:02.750
<v Speaker 1>You take great shots or whoever your</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera man is great shots of being a</v>

114
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.860
<v Speaker 1>fireman and closeups on leaves floating</v>
<v Speaker 1>down a river and you just get,</v>

115
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 1>you get a real sense of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is missing.</v>

116
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.100
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still,</v>

117
00:05:12.101 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 1>you're still getting a blink of Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

118
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>multiple weeks in the wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

119
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.360
<v Speaker 1>But you at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a feel like,</v>

120
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.900
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something very different than</v>

121
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>what's being portrayed.</v>

122
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.010
<v Speaker 1>This is like this intense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost spiritual experience in this very</v>

123
00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 1>bizarre environment that surrounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

124
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>And we think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

125
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 1>in these weird terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're out there in it,</v>

126
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to capture what</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like.</v>

127
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:42.880
<v Speaker 1>And I think you've done an amazing job</v>
<v Speaker 1>at doing that.</v>

128
00:05:42.881 --> 00:05:45.450
<v Speaker 1>And here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's put some of your stuff up online</v>

129
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.660
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get a chance to see it.</v>

130
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:47.700
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

131
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.990
<v Speaker 1>and I appreciate that it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>

132
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>It drives me nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead.</v>

133
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.451
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

134
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to say,</v>

135
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever's doing your editing,</v>

136
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 1>kyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fantastic.</v>

137
00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really talented.</v>

138
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 1>He does a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good job of,</v>

139
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 1>of just picking good shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just the overall experience is</v>

140
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 1>relayed very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you get a chance to see like,</v>

141
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.471
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

142
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 1>this is an adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't just as simple as,</v>

143
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's going out there trying to fill</v>

144
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>a freezer with wild game meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

145
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on an adventure.</v>

146
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 1>And then the wild game meat is a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

147
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all apps.</v>

148
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.330
<v Speaker 1>A lot of shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was,</v>

149
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:24.980
<v Speaker 1>this piece right here was specifically</v>

150
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.460
<v Speaker 2>don for Nat Geo because they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

151
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.220
<v Speaker 2>the National Geographic Society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the magazine.</v>

152
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.950
<v Speaker 2>And then they have national geographic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the TV show.</v>

153
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.180
<v Speaker 2>And so they wanted to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hit me up for a bunch of TV shows.</v>

154
00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:42.930
<v Speaker 2>They wanted me to come and find bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted me to,</v>

155
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.490
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

156
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.710
<v Speaker 2>they call the fuck are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they called me for everything.</v>

157
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.390
<v Speaker 2>They would call me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

158
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.660
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

159
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.850
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are you right now?</v>

160
00:06:50.851 --> 00:06:52.200
<v Speaker 2>Where are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's your cabin?</v>

161
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.330
<v Speaker 2>And I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a cabin.</v>

162
00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:55.181
<v Speaker 2>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

163
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:57.240
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm surely you're skinning a beaver out</v>

164
00:06:57.241 --> 00:06:58.260
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

165
00:06:58.261 --> 00:06:58.621
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

166
00:06:58.621 --> 00:06:59.760
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in Wisconsin.</v>

167
00:06:59.761 --> 00:07:03.930
<v Speaker 2>Just taught in Minneapolis and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking my labrador down the street in</v>

168
00:07:03.931 --> 00:07:05.910
<v Speaker 2>shorts and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

169
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.991
<v Speaker 2>and so they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

170
00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:08.910
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they really want to do a TV show.</v>

171
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.560
<v Speaker 2>And they wanted it to encapsulate</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting to some degree.</v>

172
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.590
<v Speaker 2>But the society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the magazine was against hunting.</v>

173
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.950
<v Speaker 2>The TV show would allow it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they wanted me to do a no bullshit a</v>

174
00:07:23.281 --> 00:07:27.420
<v Speaker 2>sermon if you will download looking down</v>
<v Speaker 2>the barrel of the camera and just said,</v>

175
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:28.820
<v Speaker 2>this isn't going to go public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

176
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.230
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't have to be pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to be edited well,</v>

177
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 2>but just please tell us why you hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>W try to explain it so that we can bring</v>

178
00:07:36.571 --> 00:07:39.810
<v Speaker 2>it to our producers and saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why he hunts.</v>

179
00:07:39.811 --> 00:07:42.900
<v Speaker 2>And so I did this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had my little temper tantrum there.</v>

180
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.470
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in doing it realized like,</v>

181
00:07:46.471 --> 00:07:48.810
<v Speaker 2>it made me really question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

182
00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:49.471
<v Speaker 2>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

183
00:07:49.471 --> 00:07:53.070
<v Speaker 2>so you want to know why I hunt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it made me take a step back and</v>

184
00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:55.470
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

185
00:07:55.471 --> 00:07:57.030
<v Speaker 2>for the love of God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't even know.</v>

186
00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why I hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can explain some of the areas.</v>

187
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.190
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't explain why I'm a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't explain exactly why a hunt,</v>

188
00:08:05.191 --> 00:08:10.191
<v Speaker 2>but I can tell you I love the adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you I love the really clean</v>

189
00:08:10.201 --> 00:08:14.580
<v Speaker 2>protein that I get for me and my family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you that our ancestry</v>

190
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:19.700
<v Speaker 2>unequivocally comes from 100% groups of</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunters and gatherers that's around the</v>

191
00:08:20.071 --> 00:08:22.170
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you all of these points.</v>

192
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.430
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you that I love seeing</v>
<v Speaker 2>antlers of all sizes and and the hides,</v>

193
00:08:26.431 --> 00:08:29.310
<v Speaker 2>and I can tell you I love watching</v>
<v Speaker 2>grizzly bears eat blueberries and</v>

194
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.890
<v Speaker 2>watching salmon come up a river to</v>
<v Speaker 2>spawn.</v>

195
00:08:31.891 --> 00:08:36.150
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know if all of those things</v>

196
00:08:36.151 --> 00:08:39.210
<v Speaker 2>make me a hunter or if I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiencing all those things because I</v>

197
00:08:39.211 --> 00:08:41.970
<v Speaker 2>am a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just very difficult to articulate.</v>

198
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.870
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to articulate how</v>
<v Speaker 2>much you love something,</v>

199
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.430
<v Speaker 2>yet you're willing to engage it in such</v>
<v Speaker 2>a heavy way,</v>

200
00:08:50.431 --> 00:08:53.310
<v Speaker 2>such a violent way that you're willing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to step in,</v>

201
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.380
<v Speaker 2>kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut up,</v>

202
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 2>get your hands</v>

203
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.810
<v Speaker 1>bloody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because really,</v>

204
00:08:57.811 --> 00:09:01.800
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We love it so much that we're willing to</v>

205
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 1>expose ourselves to the elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put ourselves in these places,</v>

206
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 1>let the air or the bullet go watch an</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal die,</v>

207
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:12.730
<v Speaker 1>which is never a never an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to watch.</v>

208
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I say interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just not a pleasurable thing to</v>

209
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:17.550
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is how we engage as hunters</v>

210
00:09:17.551 --> 00:09:20.160
<v Speaker 1>into these environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was trying to convey that to</v>

211
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 1>nat geo and a seven minute piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Kyle,</v>

212
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after he put it together,</v>

213
00:09:26.251 --> 00:09:27.420
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should release this.</v>

214
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell no.</v>

215
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Hell No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk about Peta in it.</v>

216
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 1>I talk about being a vegetarian in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm not against vegetarianism.</v>

217
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:37.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm pete as a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

218
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he insisted.</v>

219
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:42.090
<v Speaker 1>So he finally won the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

220
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

221
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea behind ethical treatment of</v>

222
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:48.180
<v Speaker 1>animals is amazing.</v>

223
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

224
00:09:49.651 --> 00:09:50.990
<v Speaker 1>like you were saying you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>labrador.</v>

225
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.360
<v Speaker 1>The idea that hunters hate animals too</v>
<v Speaker 1>is also a very confusing thing.</v>

226
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.850
<v Speaker 1>This is ponders love animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

227
00:09:56.851 --> 00:09:58.860
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of hunters that have dogs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cats.</v>

228
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But ethical treatment of animals is,</v>

229
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.890
<v Speaker 1>is imperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very important.</v>

230
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we are really the stewards of nature,</v>

231
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:11.430
<v Speaker 1>if we were really the top of the food</v>
<v Speaker 1>chain and we most certainly are we and</v>

232
00:10:11.431 --> 00:10:13.860
<v Speaker 1>we're conscious and we have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscience,</v>

233
00:10:13.861 --> 00:10:17.160
<v Speaker 1>we absolutely should be ethical in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment of animals and take care of</v>

234
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:22.020
<v Speaker 1>them and be kind to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which the problem with Peta is that's</v>

235
00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:25.620
<v Speaker 1>not really what they're about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the Animal Liberation</v>

236
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what they really are,</v>

237
00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.240
<v Speaker 1>what they're about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want any animals to be pets.</v>

238
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't want people to have pets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is,</v>

239
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:35.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean this sounds radical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's absolutely true.</v>

240
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.360
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peta euthanizes thousands of pets a</v>

241
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.490
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kill pets and they killed them</v>

242
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:43.860
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't keep him alive very long.</v>

243
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:46.980
<v Speaker 1>And the idea being is that for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>critics,</v>

244
00:10:46.981 --> 00:10:47.221
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

245
00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:48.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea has been bandied about is they</v>

246
00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:52.290
<v Speaker 1>don't want these animals to live and</v>
<v Speaker 1>breed and stay pets.</v>

247
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:56.280
<v Speaker 1>They want animals to only be wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine,</v>

248
00:10:56.281 --> 00:11:00.690
<v Speaker 1>but there's thousands and thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years of domesticated animals,</v>

249
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.820
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to let those animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>loose,</v>

250
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 1>it have them wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a whole another series of</v>

251
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:08.520
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you want to kill all the golden</v>

252
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:11.640
<v Speaker 1>retrievers and all the Chihuahuas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that they're not going to survive in</v>

253
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:12.474
<v Speaker 1>the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

254
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.750
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've perpetuated pass that a long time</v>

255
00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:16.141
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

256
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:17.970
<v Speaker 1>They're not wild animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just not.</v>

257
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.930
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

258
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little fat kids.</v>

259
00:11:20.851 --> 00:11:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Not a wild animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either.</v>

260
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:24.120
<v Speaker 1>You leave him in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to die just as quickly as</v>

261
00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:24.954
<v Speaker 1>your fucking Chihuahua.</v>

262
00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.070
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

263
00:11:26.071 --> 00:11:27.340
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

264
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:28.830
<v Speaker 1>This is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

265
00:11:28.831 --> 00:11:33.180
<v Speaker 1>so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a weird ideology that they're</v>

266
00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:35.230
<v Speaker 1>attached to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

267
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.740
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not tenable.</v>

268
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:38.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

269
00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.890
<v Speaker 1>you can't argue it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

270
00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.020
<v Speaker 1>the idea of ethical treatment of</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>

271
00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:47.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100% with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hate the whole idea of captive</v>

272
00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 1>orkis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That to me is one of the big rows that</v>

273
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 1>freaks me the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we can take these alien creatures</v>

274
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:59.071
<v Speaker 1>that are essentially as smart as us</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably and put them in swimming pools</v>

275
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 1>and justify it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that the only time they've ever</v>

276
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 1>killed people in recorded history has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been in those swimming pools.</v>

277
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.260
<v Speaker 1>They don't kill people in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kill everything else.</v>

278
00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:10.300
<v Speaker 1>They kill whales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed dolphins,</v>

279
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.670
<v Speaker 1>they kill sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't fuck with people.</v>

280
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:14.200
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been instances where they've</v>

281
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:17.860
<v Speaker 1>saved people and yet we've decided to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put those.</v>

282
00:12:17.861 --> 00:12:20.530
<v Speaker 1>So me and Peter are on the hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent the same page as that.</v>

283
00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:23.500
<v Speaker 1>And Pete has retweeted a bunch of shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've put up before,</v>

284
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:26.400
<v Speaker 1>which is really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They retweeted a bunch of shit that I've</v>

285
00:12:26.401 --> 00:12:27.670
<v Speaker 1>put up about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

286
00:12:27.671 --> 00:12:28.740
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

287
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.030
<v Speaker 1>orcas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I've done that,</v>

288
00:12:31.031 --> 00:12:31.841
<v Speaker 1>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

289
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:32.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hunts,</v>

290
00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:33.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

291
00:12:33.641 --> 00:12:34.720
<v Speaker 1>then it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

292
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:36.950
<v Speaker 1>radio silence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

293
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.510
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to comment on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want to support my hate for,</v>

294
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:41.463
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orca.</v>

295
00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:42.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

296
00:12:42.591 --> 00:12:43.251
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

297
00:12:43.251 --> 00:12:44.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most,</v>

298
00:12:44.781 --> 00:12:48.080
<v Speaker 2>I've had some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been fortunate to have remarkable</v>

299
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.830
<v Speaker 2>engagements with wildlife in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but two years ago in NBC,</v>

300
00:12:51.831 --> 00:12:53.840
<v Speaker 2>I had one with a killer whale and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

301
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.910
<v Speaker 2>it was wicked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to this day I regret not making the</v>

302
00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:01.340
<v Speaker 2>decision I'm about to tell you about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we had been,</v>

303
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd been bear hunting on the coast and</v>

304
00:13:04.101 --> 00:13:08.120
<v Speaker 2>we were in a boat cruising back to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>harbor and we found two pods of killer</v>

305
00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:09.180
<v Speaker 2>whales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

306
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.360
<v Speaker 2>three big bowls and a bunch of cows that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were hunting.</v>

307
00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:12.460
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

308
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.230
<v Speaker 2>we kept as they would come up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were chasing salmon and as they</v>

309
00:13:15.231 --> 00:13:18.110
<v Speaker 2>would come up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've just get closer just to film them</v>

310
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.570
<v Speaker 2>or even just to see them and then they'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>go down.</v>

311
00:13:20.571 --> 00:13:24.310
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was just happenstance</v>

312
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.900
<v Speaker 2>of where we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we came up and we were just kind of</v>

313
00:13:26.901 --> 00:13:30.110
<v Speaker 2>waiting for the whole pod to come up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden,</v>

314
00:13:30.111 --> 00:13:32.420
<v Speaker 2>just 50 feet from the boat.</v>

315
00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Here comes the huge dorsal fin of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>bowl,</v>

316
00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:38.750
<v Speaker 2>comes right at our boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bumps into our boat.</v>

317
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm standing on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the crow's nest,</v>

318
00:13:41.241 --> 00:13:43.640
<v Speaker 2>essentially I'm on the roof of the boat</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the same,</v>

319
00:13:43.641 --> 00:13:47.000
<v Speaker 2>he comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bumps into our boat and he just glides</v>

320
00:13:47.001 --> 00:13:52.001
<v Speaker 2>his left side all along the boat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his left pectoral fin is probably</v>

321
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.800
<v Speaker 2>under our gunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>

322
00:13:54.801 --> 00:13:58.460
<v Speaker 2>or under our hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he's just dragging his finn and</v>

323
00:13:58.461 --> 00:14:02.060
<v Speaker 2>he rotates on his side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dragging his dorsal fin along our side</v>

324
00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.410
<v Speaker 2>exhales covering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm our director of photography Williams</v>

325
00:14:06.411 --> 00:14:09.650
<v Speaker 2>face in his spray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as he's doing this,</v>

326
00:14:09.651 --> 00:14:12.770
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he hugs the bowel of our boat and he</v>

327
00:14:12.771 --> 00:14:17.771
<v Speaker 2>never ever breaks eye contact with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's staring at me out of his left eye,</v>

328
00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:22.220
<v Speaker 2>literally rolling his eye over and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>just cruises all the way around the</v>

329
00:14:22.221 --> 00:14:23.054
<v Speaker 2>boat.</v>

330
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.890
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

331
00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:26.840
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to dive in and I just wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

332
00:14:26.841 --> 00:14:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't want to be one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to die.</v>

333
00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.540
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to be the first guy to</v>
<v Speaker 2>die.</v>

334
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.230
<v Speaker 2>And I also didn't want to have like some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of shallow water blackout because</v>

335
00:14:36.231 --> 00:14:38.900
<v Speaker 2>the water was so cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't want to dive in and have all</v>

336
00:14:38.901 --> 00:14:41.480
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I didn't know how my body would</v>

337
00:14:41.481 --> 00:14:43.130
<v Speaker 2>react cause I hadn't been in the water</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

338
00:14:43.131 --> 00:14:44.090
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

339
00:14:44.091 --> 00:14:45.530
<v Speaker 2>and then also I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

340
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd watched black fish or whatever that</v>

341
00:14:47.901 --> 00:14:50.120
<v Speaker 2>film is really killed a bunch of folks</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

342
00:14:50.121 --> 00:14:52.310
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in seaworld and NBC</v>

343
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.151
<v Speaker 3>and saw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just like,</v>

344
00:14:53.151 --> 00:14:56.120
<v Speaker 3>well what if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be at first,</v>

345
00:14:56.121 --> 00:14:58.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves never killed anyone any either.</v>

346
00:14:58.371 --> 00:14:59.061
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

347
00:14:59.061 --> 00:15:02.180

<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] son of a bitch,</v>

348
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:03.410
<v Speaker 3>we have number one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

349
00:15:03.411 --> 00:15:06.520
<v Speaker 3>there's a long history of killing people</v>
<v Speaker 3>though in the past.</v>

350
00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:07.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

351
00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:08.480
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

352
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.800
<v Speaker 3>in recorded time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was still,</v>

353
00:15:09.801 --> 00:15:10.790
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>

354
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:14.420
<v Speaker 3>and he maintained eye contact turned and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then just continued on with the hunt.</v>

355
00:15:14.421 --> 00:15:17.360
<v Speaker 3>But it was the only film all this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

356
00:15:17.361 --> 00:15:19.700
<v Speaker 3>Well you filmed as much as we could</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it happened really fast.</v>

357
00:15:19.701 --> 00:15:20.810
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was wicked.</v>

358
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.580
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely wicked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:26.510
<v Speaker 3>his dorsal fins probably 10 feet tall</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it is just,</v>

361
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you drag something against another</v>

362
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.300
<v Speaker 3>on in an object with force,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

363
00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:33.140
<v Speaker 3>it's finished.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

364
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just very engaged with the boat</v>

365
00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:37.860
<v Speaker 3>as a doorstop.</v>

366
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

371
00:15:45.821 --> 00:15:47.380
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so big.</v>

372
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>dolphins in the wall and I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>whales in the wild.</v>

374
00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen an Orca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean wicked animals.</v>

376
00:15:55.421 --> 00:15:57.010
<v Speaker 1>We don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't even comprehend what that</v>

377
00:15:57.011 --> 00:16:00.160
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if Orca is weren't real and big</v>

378
00:16:00.161 --> 00:16:02.950
<v Speaker 1>foot was real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't give a shit about big foot,</v>

379
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:06.130
<v Speaker 1>big foot who'd be in the zoo right next</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the fucking orangutans.</v>

380
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.061
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>look at the big monkey stupid monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

382
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But orcas,</v>

383
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:15.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean they speak in a language that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't decipher.</v>

384
00:16:15.221 --> 00:16:17.830
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know that they have dialects.</v>

385
00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.800
<v Speaker 1>We know that they stay in these pods for</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

386
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.760
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

387
00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.710
<v Speaker 1>they have this family organization and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all stay in their clan there.</v>

388
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.570
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've seen,</v>

389
00:16:28.571 --> 00:16:30.580
<v Speaker 1>you've seen black fish obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

390
00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I so much as I could watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could watch the whole thing and I get</v>

391
00:16:33.341 --> 00:16:35.520
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

392
00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I get furious that this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a giant business,</v>

393
00:16:38.441 --> 00:16:42.430
<v Speaker 1>that they take these things and they buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>them from other organizations.</v>

394
00:16:42.431 --> 00:16:43.960
<v Speaker 1>And I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

395
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had real problems with it for a</v>

396
00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:49.360
<v Speaker 1>long time and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt my friend Phil Demars,</v>

397
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:53.230
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a a trainer at marine land and he's been</v>

398
00:16:53.231 --> 00:16:55.660
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times and he's involved in these</v>

399
00:16:55.661 --> 00:16:58.580
<v Speaker 1>constant lawsuits with Bahrain land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

400
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.500
<v Speaker 1>he was a walrus trainer and he also</v>
<v Speaker 1>trained killer whales and you know,</v>

401
00:17:02.501 --> 00:17:07.501
<v Speaker 1>he's given us some real insight into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrors of what it's like in marine land</v>

402
00:17:07.931 --> 00:17:10.150
<v Speaker 1>and even in seaworld and what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and how they,</v>

403
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.650
<v Speaker 1>how they get these orchids and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how they're treated and how bad it</v>

404
00:17:14.651 --> 00:17:18.010
<v Speaker 1>is for them to be trapped in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>environments and how their dorsal fins</v>

405
00:17:18.011 --> 00:17:20.410
<v Speaker 1>go limp because they never have to deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with current.</v>

406
00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:22.920
<v Speaker 1>So the atrophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole thing is sick.</v>

407
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.720
<v Speaker 1>It's sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they still have them now and killer</v>

408
00:17:25.721 --> 00:17:27.250
<v Speaker 1>whales at sea world now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

409
00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still have them.</v>

410
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't,</v>

411
00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.950
<v Speaker 1>they can't buy new ones apparently or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

412
00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.240
<v Speaker 1>There's someone here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>

413
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole thing.</v>

414
00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:37.630
<v Speaker 1>They can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they could still breed them</v>

415
00:17:37.631 --> 00:17:38.021
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

416
00:17:38.021 --> 00:17:39.400
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

417
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.620
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like slavery.</v>

418
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.830
<v Speaker 1>If like we had aliens as slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just couldn't,</v>

419
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.000
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you saying?</v>

420
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.691
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

421
00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:47.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

422
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Get in the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to fish in the fucking pool.</v>

423
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's basically what's going on.</v>

424
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:53.131
<v Speaker 1>It's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

425
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:53.964
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sick.</v>

426
00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.220
<v Speaker 1>It's twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

427
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just,</v>

428
00:17:57.361 --> 00:17:59.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's where me and peed were,</v>

429
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.960
<v Speaker 1>we're on the same page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

430
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:02.430
<v Speaker 1>I think anyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

431
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treating anything with ethics,</v>

432
00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

433
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Particularly animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course a hunters are animal lovers.</v>

434
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:09.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we rescue dogs,</v>

435
00:18:09.841 --> 00:18:11.010
<v Speaker 1>we rescue cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

436
00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.800
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it absolutely goes without saying,</v>

437
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:16.710
<v Speaker 1>which is where the contention comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

438
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:18.260
<v Speaker 1>That's where the questions come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

439
00:18:18.261 --> 00:18:19.094
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

440
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:24.000
<v Speaker 1>I get as many letters from non hunters</v>
<v Speaker 1>and from,</v>

441
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that think that they're against</v>

442
00:18:26.701 --> 00:18:28.570
<v Speaker 1>hunting or have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

443
00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe damning questions than I do from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunters themselves.</v>

444
00:18:32.161 --> 00:18:32.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

445
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:37.580
<v Speaker 1>I get letters from Hunter's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say you're a bad ass or you really</v>

446
00:18:37.651 --> 00:18:39.450
<v Speaker 1>inspire me or you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

447
00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:42.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really happy that I can have my kids</v>

448
00:18:42.271 --> 00:18:44.550
<v Speaker 1>watch your films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't let them watch a hunting</v>

449
00:18:44.551 --> 00:18:46.860
<v Speaker 1>tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we sit down and they want to</v>

450
00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:48.810
<v Speaker 1>see something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to ingest something that has</v>

451
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:50.550
<v Speaker 1>hunting and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll watch your films.</v>

452
00:18:50.551 --> 00:18:51.720
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that's really cool.</v>

453
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.770
<v Speaker 1>But I get a lot of questions from non</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunters and then people that have some</v>

454
00:18:55.771 --> 00:18:58.290
<v Speaker 1>contention with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think there's a lot of people out</v>

455
00:18:58.291 --> 00:19:01.770
<v Speaker 1>there that are curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean 90 depending on who you asked,</v>

456
00:19:01.771 --> 00:19:06.771
<v Speaker 1>95 or 90% 97% of the population eats</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat and the percentage that actually</v>

457
00:19:08.101 --> 00:19:10.500
<v Speaker 1>killed that meet themselves is</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly small.</v>

458
00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:12.690
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like a 1% you know what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean?</v>

459
00:19:12.691 --> 00:19:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be a little bit harder than</v>

460
00:19:14.371 --> 00:19:15.660
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's no more than five.</v>

461
00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.730
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>just on the fence and they're there.</v>

462
00:19:19.731 --> 00:19:21.390
<v Speaker 1>They're just sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

463
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.810
<v Speaker 1>I eat it but I don't kill myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

464
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.170
<v Speaker 1>I somehow or another were angry that</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's doing it themselves.</v>

465
00:19:28.171 --> 00:19:31.740
<v Speaker 1>Like my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I ever thought about hunting,</v>

466
00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:36.330
<v Speaker 1>my thoughts about hunters were that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were cruel people that like to kill</v>

467
00:19:36.331 --> 00:19:37.110
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

468
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Why would you kill animals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessary.</v>

469
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.960
<v Speaker 1>You can buy meat from a store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the very shallow thinking that I</v>

470
00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:43.860
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

471
00:19:43.861 --> 00:19:46.080
<v Speaker 1>decades ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then,</v>

472
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I started getting older and really</v>

473
00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:52.980
<v Speaker 1>considering what I do with my body and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of food I put in,</v>

474
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.670
<v Speaker 1>and then the internet was a big one</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the internet came along and I</v>

475
00:19:56.671 --> 00:20:00.450
<v Speaker 1>started watching those videos that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them that Peter puts up of factory</v>

476
00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:02.910
<v Speaker 1>farming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh and I'm terrible.</v>

477
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.890
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just terrible.</v>

478
00:20:04.891 --> 00:20:06.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

479
00:20:06.811 --> 00:20:11.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like human beings at their very</v>

480
00:20:11.281 --> 00:20:15.900
<v Speaker 1>worst that we've treated these things as</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the the most,</v>

481
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:23.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean not just as a commodity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've ignored their feelings and</v>

482
00:20:23.221 --> 00:20:27.000
<v Speaker 1>their thoughts and their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they have instincts and</v>

483
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:29.550
<v Speaker 1>needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that we've stuffed them into these</v>

484
00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:30.720
<v Speaker 1>tiny little cages.</v>

485
00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a sickness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you see the cruel,</v>

486
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.610
<v Speaker 1>inhumane treatment that some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that work there,</v>

487
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people that work in farms will tell</v>

488
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:37.771
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

489
00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:41.850
<v Speaker 1>this is very rare and these are isolated</v>
<v Speaker 1>instances and this is terrible.</v>

490
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:45.300
<v Speaker 1>That's well and good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's also ag gag laws that</v>

491
00:20:45.301 --> 00:20:49.720
<v Speaker 1>prevent people from filming agricultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>gag laws that prevent people from</v>

492
00:20:49.721 --> 00:20:53.200
<v Speaker 1>filming on these factory farms because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want people to know how</v>

493
00:20:53.201 --> 00:20:54.780
<v Speaker 1>horrific those conditions are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

494
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:56.710
<v Speaker 1>there's some truth to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

495
00:20:56.711 --> 00:20:59.530
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're isolated instances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a small percentage of the</v>

496
00:20:59.531 --> 00:21:01.300
<v Speaker 1>farms that do treat their animals like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

497
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:05.350
<v Speaker 1>But it's significant enough that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about the impact on the economy</v>

498
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.400
<v Speaker 1>to the point where they're passing laws</v>
<v Speaker 1>that keep people from filming and</v>

499
00:21:09.401 --> 00:21:11.260
<v Speaker 1>showing people what it's like in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

500
00:21:11.261 --> 00:21:13.660
<v Speaker 1>And you can even just show people</v>
<v Speaker 1>without any abuse,</v>

501
00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.400
<v Speaker 1>just show what's going on.</v>

502
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Just even a still photo of how they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>living and you're not going to want to</v>

503
00:21:19.601 --> 00:21:22.930
<v Speaker 1>consume the food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these and the people that they think</v>

504
00:21:22.931 --> 00:21:25.090
<v Speaker 1>that these animals were raised this way</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

505
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Their cows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their bovines,</v>

506
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.100
<v Speaker 1>they're big dumb animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were bred for this.</v>

507
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea what's going on until</v>

508
00:21:33.251 --> 00:21:36.640
<v Speaker 1>that spike hits him or they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>electrocuted or they get their throats</v>

509
00:21:36.641 --> 00:21:39.670
<v Speaker 1>slit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you have anywhere with hall at</v>

510
00:21:39.671 --> 00:21:41.440
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have any,</v>

511
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:46.360
<v Speaker 1>being any soul at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe this is the wrong</v>

512
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:51.100
<v Speaker 1>idealization or the wrong picture and</v>
<v Speaker 1>building my head,</v>

513
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:54.520
<v Speaker 1>but if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you make yourself the cow just for a</v>

514
00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:56.770
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you remove yourself just for a</v>

515
00:21:56.771 --> 00:22:01.420
<v Speaker 1>freaking second and just say like is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this how I would want to be treated?</v>

516
00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Is this how I would want to live?</v>

517
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Is this how I would want to die?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you start to ask yourself some</v>

518
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:10.300
<v Speaker 1>pretty big questions that are relatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to answer and we have a lot of</v>

519
00:22:10.301 --> 00:22:15.301
<v Speaker 1>people on the earth right now and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to continue until something big</v>

520
00:22:15.581 --> 00:22:16.371
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

521
00:22:16.371 --> 00:22:18.940
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can remove yourself from your own</v>

522
00:22:18.941 --> 00:22:23.740
<v Speaker 1>ego and from your own comfort and try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>visualize at all what these other</v>

523
00:22:23.741 --> 00:22:25.780
<v Speaker 1>animals are going through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even animals you're hunting,</v>

524
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:29.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna make you better and more</v>

525
00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:34.381
<v Speaker 1>cognizant of being ethical and treating</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything with absolute care even in</v>

526
00:22:34.571 --> 00:22:35.800
<v Speaker 1>killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

527
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictions there though,</v>

528
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With hunting because like if you really</v>

529
00:22:41.681 --> 00:22:43.120
<v Speaker 1>care about the animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you kill it?</v>

530
00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:43.661
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

531
00:22:43.661 --> 00:22:44.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the big question.</v>

532
00:22:44.771 --> 00:22:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hardest thing to wrap your head</v>

533
00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:46.600
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

534
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not,</v>

535
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.600
<v Speaker 1>if you're not in doing our wilderness</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

536
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:51.101
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

537
00:22:51.101 --> 00:22:52.420
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely wild.</v>

538
00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:54.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public lands in particular,</v>

539
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.020
<v Speaker 1>they're very there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely wild.</v>

540
00:22:56.170 --> 00:23:00.160
<v Speaker 1>But it's also a very weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of the funding for that</v>

541
00:23:00.161 --> 00:23:05.161
<v Speaker 1>wildlife comes from people that buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting tags and hunting equipment in</v>

542
00:23:05.861 --> 00:23:09.520
<v Speaker 1>order to kill those animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way those animals are sustained</v>

543
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:14.320
<v Speaker 1>and the way the wildlife's are protected</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the way that the wardens and game</v>

544
00:23:14.321 --> 00:23:19.321
<v Speaker 1>rangers are paid is a lot of it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the hunters who want to go out</v>

545
00:23:20.111 --> 00:23:22.840
<v Speaker 1>and kill the animals that live on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a lot of people like,</v>

546
00:23:22.841 --> 00:23:25.240
<v Speaker 1>well Keith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is wild sorta,</v>

547
00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.060
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean sword a sword.</v>

548
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.670
<v Speaker 1>It's protected by people that want to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that water.</v>

549
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean engage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

550
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.351
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

551
00:23:32.351 --> 00:23:34.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're reducing it to a single</v>
<v Speaker 1>variable.</v>

552
00:23:34.271 --> 00:23:36.910
<v Speaker 1>So you want to protect these Lx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go in there and kill an elk.</v>

553
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to protect these.</v>

554
00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.830
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to protect the habitat so these l</v>

555
00:23:41.831 --> 00:23:46.010
<v Speaker 1>can thrive and then in certain instances</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and remove</v>

556
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.280
<v Speaker 2>a few animals or in certain instances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you're in Alaska or something</v>

557
00:23:49.281 --> 00:23:51.020
<v Speaker 2>like that and hunting a stable Caribou</v>
<v Speaker 2>herd,</v>

558
00:23:51.021 --> 00:23:52.610
<v Speaker 2>you can go in and remove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

559
00:23:52.611 --> 00:23:55.040
<v Speaker 2>not everything is based off of sole</v>
<v Speaker 2>management,</v>

560
00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:57.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As animals encroach where people are,</v>

561
00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.070
<v Speaker 2>we need to cut their numbers down</v>
<v Speaker 2>because humans have taken up so much</v>

562
00:24:01.071 --> 00:24:01.904
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

563
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are other populations that are</v>

564
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.850
<v Speaker 2>trending in relative harmony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they have big,</v>

565
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:10.550
<v Speaker 2>huge scales of land and we're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>drilling for oil or whatever,</v>

566
00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.300
<v Speaker 2>who already can go and remove a few a</v>
<v Speaker 2>few animals in their Predator and prey</v>

567
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:16.250
<v Speaker 2>scenario and it works just fine for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>herd.</v>

568
00:24:16.251 --> 00:24:18.430
<v Speaker 2>It works just fine for the population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually,</v>

569
00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a very small way helps the population</v>

570
00:24:21.651 --> 00:24:24.410
<v Speaker 2>by removing certain animals for an age</v>
<v Speaker 2>class or a sex class,</v>

571
00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:25.760
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

572
00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the difficulty is we're,</v>

573
00:24:28.251 --> 00:24:32.750
<v Speaker 2>we're preserving the habitat so that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can go in and engage in the wild.</v>

574
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:33.231
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

575
00:24:33.231 --> 00:24:36.440
<v Speaker 2>I think also a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think you buy your gun,</v>

576
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.750
<v Speaker 2>you buy your bow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you buy your tag,</v>

577
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.480
<v Speaker 2>you go to Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you leave with an elk.</v>

578
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is how it works for like 15% of the</v>

579
00:24:45.231 --> 00:24:46.250
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that,</v>

580
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:49.970
<v Speaker 2>if that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a whole contingent of 80% or</v>

581
00:24:49.971 --> 00:24:53.510
<v Speaker 2>90% of people that buy their bowl by</v>
<v Speaker 2>their gun,</v>

582
00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.580
<v Speaker 2>by their pickup truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get their hotel room,</v>

583
00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.400
<v Speaker 2>get their tent hike 20 miles into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wilderness,</v>

584
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.400
<v Speaker 2>strike out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listened to a lot of quiet,</v>

585
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 2>look around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hike out,</v>

586
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.540
<v Speaker 2>get back in their truck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drive home,</v>

587
00:25:05.541 --> 00:25:09.530
<v Speaker 2>send me an email saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where is it that you find elk around</v>

588
00:25:09.531 --> 00:25:12.980
<v Speaker 2>September 15th in Utah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's instill those people are</v>

589
00:25:12.981 --> 00:25:14.270
<v Speaker 2>engaging in still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

590
00:25:14.271 --> 00:25:16.250
<v Speaker 2>and there's all different wides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

591
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's fly fishermen in El counters</v>

592
00:25:18.221 --> 00:25:19.580
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's people that just want to</v>

593
00:25:19.581 --> 00:25:21.920
<v Speaker 2>take photos and so everyone has their</v>
<v Speaker 2>different engagement.</v>

594
00:25:21.921 --> 00:25:25.910
<v Speaker 2>But that's really what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have what we're trending towards</v>

595
00:25:25.911 --> 00:25:27.680
<v Speaker 2>8 billion people on the face of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

596
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.903
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

597
00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:34.400
<v Speaker 1>large scale agriculture and farming and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in animal agriculture as well has</v>

598
00:25:35.791 --> 00:25:40.050
<v Speaker 1>created this environment where people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can thrive in these cities where they're</v>

599
00:25:40.051 --> 00:25:42.120
<v Speaker 1>not growing any food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean California,</v>

600
00:25:42.121 --> 00:25:44.280
<v Speaker 1>where we're at right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the weirdest places on the</v>

601
00:25:44.281 --> 00:25:46.110
<v Speaker 1>planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's 20 million people.</v>

602
00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.490
<v Speaker 1>No one's growing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we'd,</v>

603
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look around here,</v>

604
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.210
<v Speaker 1>it's just a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no farms out here,</v>

605
00:25:51.211 --> 00:25:52.080
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

606
00:25:52.081 --> 00:25:53.150
<v Speaker 1>it's farms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

607
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's completely,</v>

608
00:25:54.391 --> 00:25:56.820
<v Speaker 1>we're in the people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these people that are writing a</v>

609
00:25:56.821 --> 00:25:58.170
<v Speaker 1>lot of these people that are against</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

610
00:25:58.171 --> 00:26:01.840
<v Speaker 1>They're so hypocritical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're eating cheeseburgers while the</v>

611
00:26:01.841 --> 00:26:04.170
<v Speaker 1>types and how hypocritical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very strange.</v>

612
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've been that person.</v>

613
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.000
<v Speaker 1>I've been that meat eating person who</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that that hunters recording,</v>

614
00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:12.480
<v Speaker 1>I've been that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

615
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.860
<v Speaker 1>I know where they're coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

616
00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:17.040
<v Speaker 1>and I've considered vegetarianism and V</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I was fighting,</v>

617
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:19.920
<v Speaker 1>I was a Vegan or a vegetarian rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

618
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was probably considered Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I was eating any cheese</v>

619
00:26:23.281 --> 00:26:26.580
<v Speaker 1>and I wasn't drinking any milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I did that for like six months.</v>

620
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.830
<v Speaker 1>It didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just didn't agree with me,</v>

621
00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.380
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe I didn't do it right and I</v>

622
00:26:31.381 --> 00:26:33.810
<v Speaker 1>never did it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was doing it to try to lose weight</v>

623
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.620
<v Speaker 1>as what else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was also not eating enough.</v>

624
00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:38.401
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

625
00:26:38.401 --> 00:26:40.410
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot going on there cause I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was trying to fight it,</v>

626
00:26:40.411 --> 00:26:43.320
<v Speaker 1>a low weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

627
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:47.020
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people do it and they do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>well and it works for them,</v>

628
00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.750
<v Speaker 1>but they have to understand even that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not clean man,</v>

629
00:26:49.751 --> 00:26:52.270
<v Speaker 1>large scale agriculture in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>farming,</v>

630
00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.120
<v Speaker 1>that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kills a lot of animals and it</v>

631
00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:59.470
<v Speaker 1>displaces a lot of wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're never supposed to have a thousand</v>

632
00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:03.530
<v Speaker 1>acres of soybeans or a thousand acres of</v>
<v Speaker 1>corn or a thousand acres of fucking</v>

633
00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:05.200
<v Speaker 1>wheat or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

634
00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.530
<v Speaker 1>All that shit is fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that shit is something someone's put</v>

635
00:27:08.531 --> 00:27:10.690
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they're using pesticides that</v>

636
00:27:10.691 --> 00:27:13.210
<v Speaker 1>killing things and when they're using</v>
<v Speaker 1>those combines,</v>

637
00:27:13.211 --> 00:27:18.070
<v Speaker 1>they are grinding up bunnies and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>rats and mice and killing countless</v>

638
00:27:18.071 --> 00:27:20.020
<v Speaker 1>bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that you're getting away</v>

639
00:27:20.021 --> 00:27:22.570
<v Speaker 1>without killing any sentient life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bullshit.</v>

640
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:25.050
<v Speaker 3>And even look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the corridor of the Mississippi</v>

641
00:27:25.051 --> 00:27:27.930
<v Speaker 3>River,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right used to be solid wetlands and our</v>

642
00:27:27.931 --> 00:27:30.450
<v Speaker 3>wetlands is how we recycle water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's how we,</v>

643
00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:34.800
<v Speaker 3>that stinky biomass that you smell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's clean water being made,</v>

644
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:38.100
<v Speaker 3>that's detritus materially being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being processed.</v>

645
00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Mississippi River used to be completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>lined with these wetlands.</v>

646
00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:47.040
<v Speaker 3>Farmers have one in [inaudible] and</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's not the farmer's fault.</v>

647
00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:50.250
<v Speaker 3>This is just as soon as we started</v>
<v Speaker 3>agriculture,</v>

648
00:27:50.251 --> 00:27:54.810
<v Speaker 3>1314 15,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stopwatch was hit.</v>

649
00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.390
<v Speaker 3>We went one direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You cannot go away.</v>

650
00:27:57.391 --> 00:28:00.180
<v Speaker 3>We were hunters and gatherers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could only raise so many children.</v>

651
00:28:00.181 --> 00:28:04.170
<v Speaker 3>We had to move with the food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had to move away from our excrement.</v>

652
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:09.240
<v Speaker 3>We had to keep a small population.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the second we figured out how to</v>

653
00:28:09.241 --> 00:28:14.040
<v Speaker 3>grow corn and rice and stay in one place</v>
<v Speaker 3>and raise more than one child,</v>

654
00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:15.810
<v Speaker 3>and now we're close to our excrement.</v>

655
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:20.730
<v Speaker 3>Literally the stopwatch to something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is going to be a fantastic event</v>

656
00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:23.340
<v Speaker 3>has started.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I'm going to see it.</v>

657
00:28:23.341 --> 00:28:26.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you're going to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but something wicked is coming.</v>

658
00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:27.550
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

659
00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:31.050
<v Speaker 3>and there's no other way to look around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's there,</v>

660
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.800
<v Speaker 3>there's anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something big as overpopulation,</v>

661
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.170
<v Speaker 3>overpopulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something will happen.</v>

662
00:28:37.171 --> 00:28:38.760
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings are animals.</v>

663
00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.220
<v Speaker 3>We have awesome thumbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have great brains,</v>

664
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.820
<v Speaker 3>but we are nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing amazing about us.</v>

665
00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:47.880
<v Speaker 3>We can fly to the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can do all this great stuff.</v>

666
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.820
<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved your discussion with your flat</v>

667
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.490
<v Speaker 3>Arthur Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was freaking amazing.</v>

668
00:28:53.491 --> 00:28:56.070
<v Speaker 3>And the other guy that thinks if you eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>the perfect amount of food,</v>

669
00:28:56.071 --> 00:28:58.440
<v Speaker 3>you won't Poop or pee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's silly.</v>

670
00:28:58.441 --> 00:29:00.870
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>California remains the leading us date</v>

671
00:29:00.871 --> 00:29:03.810
<v Speaker 3>for cash farm receipts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Biggest state with,</v>

672
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:04.910
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

673
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.060
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's outside of La.</v>

674
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:07.103
<v Speaker 3>If you go outside.</v>

675
00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just talking about La,</v>

676
00:29:09.391 --> 00:29:11.190
<v Speaker 3>California as a lot of farms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

677
00:29:11.191 --> 00:29:14.820
<v Speaker 3>if you drive from La and you go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fresno,</v>

678
00:29:14.821 --> 00:29:18.060
<v Speaker 3>like when we were working to Fresno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was fucking nothing but farms like</v>

679
00:29:18.061 --> 00:29:20.010
<v Speaker 3>all the way up to San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing but farms.</v>

680
00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.040
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of almond farming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tomatoes,</v>

681
00:29:23.041 --> 00:29:24.720
<v Speaker 3>Avocados.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you look at,</v>

682
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.430
<v Speaker 3>so we've gotten rid of our wetlands and</v>
<v Speaker 3>now where are our soils are saw dust.</v>

683
00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:32.820
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing in them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we pump in the nitrogen we pump in.</v>

684
00:29:32.821 --> 00:29:35.880
<v Speaker 3>The phosphate still reigns to cause a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people don't understand that you,</v>

685
00:29:35.881 --> 00:29:39.960
<v Speaker 3>when you use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you grow vegetables on a plot of</v>

686
00:29:39.961 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 3>land over and over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you deplete</v>

687
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.740
<v Speaker 2>the soil of all the minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

688
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.760
<v Speaker 2>Because you're not letting anything die</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

689
00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.950
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are pulling from the earth,</v>

690
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.740
<v Speaker 2>you're harvesting the plant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing is dying.</v>

691
00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Nothing is returning back to the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so your er,</v>

692
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:58.110
<v Speaker 2>so then the next year you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>that detritus material creating a,</v>

693
00:29:58.181 --> 00:30:00.100
<v Speaker 2>all the goodies and the soils,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bugs,</v>

694
00:30:00.101 --> 00:30:01.150
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the microbes.</v>

695
00:30:01.151 --> 00:30:04.540
<v Speaker 2>You don't have these funguses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have these symbiotic</v>

696
00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:07.940
<v Speaker 2>relationships that are working with all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these insects and microbes diamond,</v>

697
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:11.320
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that create your soil to be a living</v>

698
00:30:11.321 --> 00:30:13.270
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've as,</v>

699
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:16.360
<v Speaker 2>as we push all that into the plant and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we harvest it and we just keep doing</v>

700
00:30:16.361 --> 00:30:17.320
<v Speaker 2>that repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

701
00:30:17.321 --> 00:30:19.930
<v Speaker 2>there's less and less of this biomass in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the soil.</v>

702
00:30:19.931 --> 00:30:24.070
<v Speaker 2>So we have to then go in and fertilize</v>
<v Speaker 2>with nitrogen and phosphorous to give</v>

703
00:30:24.071 --> 00:30:27.520
<v Speaker 2>our plants nitrogen fixation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like this to grow these plants.</v>

704
00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.100
<v Speaker 2>Then we harvest them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then rains come.</v>

705
00:30:30.101 --> 00:30:34.060
<v Speaker 2>There's a Rojan all of the soil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we lose some of our top soils,</v>

706
00:30:34.061 --> 00:30:38.530
<v Speaker 2>which brings us down to even more other</v>
<v Speaker 2>different levels of soils that need even</v>

707
00:30:38.531 --> 00:30:41.350
<v Speaker 2>more chemicals brought into them so they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can actually grow something.</v>

708
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.810
<v Speaker 2>But all these soils that are heavily</v>
<v Speaker 2>laden with,</v>

709
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.180
<v Speaker 2>with nitrogen fosters porn in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mississippi River.</v>

710
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:48.790
<v Speaker 2>And people know about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying anything that isn't,</v>

711
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't been extremely well documented</v>

712
00:30:51.451 --> 00:30:55.480
<v Speaker 2>and pushes down to the Gulf of Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sunlight hits it.</v>

713
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:57.000
<v Speaker 2>All of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

714
00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Al Algal blooms happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All this allergy hits this nitrogen and</v>

715
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:01.630
<v Speaker 2>phosphorous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It grows.</v>

716
00:31:01.631 --> 00:31:05.300
<v Speaker 2>It just like it grows a corn stock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sunlight hits it.</v>

717
00:31:05.301 --> 00:31:08.050
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have these huge blooms that needs</v>

718
00:31:08.051 --> 00:31:12.130
<v Speaker 2>oxygen to function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it creates these huge hip oxic zones,</v>

719
00:31:12.131 --> 00:31:13.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've heard these things called dead</v>

720
00:31:13.391 --> 00:31:13.720
<v Speaker 2>zones.</v>

721
00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Fish can't live in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so anyone that's hangs their hat on</v>

722
00:31:18.041 --> 00:31:21.670
<v Speaker 2>being a vegetarian or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know there's reasons for being a</v>

723
00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:24.750
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's people that refuse to</v>

724
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.170
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to kill the animal</v>

725
00:31:26.171 --> 00:31:27.970
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

726
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:28.781
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

727
00:31:28.781 --> 00:31:30.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're not going to buy from a</v>

728
00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:34.420
<v Speaker 2>factory farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably have more in common with</v>

729
00:31:34.421 --> 00:31:38.200
<v Speaker 2>vegetarian people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't want to kill their own</v>

730
00:31:38.201 --> 00:31:39.790
<v Speaker 2>animals and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

731
00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:42.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't willing to eat factory grown food</v>

732
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:45.440
<v Speaker 2>that than I have with some of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

733
00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:47.800
<v Speaker 2>hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then with other hunters,</v>

734
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:49.750
<v Speaker 2>you're saying it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

735
00:31:49.751 --> 00:31:50.830
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I also,</v>

736
00:31:50.831 --> 00:31:51.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

737
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:54.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so focused on conservation and</v>

738
00:31:54.761 --> 00:31:57.220
<v Speaker 2>habitat and being aware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not,</v>

739
00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.840
<v Speaker 2>and it's not ever present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

740
00:31:58.841 --> 00:32:01.570
<v Speaker 2>I have this awareness of when I go and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt someplace that,</v>

741
00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I,</v>

742
00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:06.850
<v Speaker 2>am I actually doing something good here?</v>

743
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:07.421
<v Speaker 2>Am I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

744
00:32:07.421 --> 00:32:10.840
<v Speaker 2>I won a few years ago to Newfoundland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hunt woodland Caribou and the</v>

745
00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:13.720
<v Speaker 2>population was really down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I got,</v>

746
00:32:13.721 --> 00:32:15.090
<v Speaker 2>I got invited to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

747
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.490
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I started looking into it because of</v>

748
00:32:17.491 --> 00:32:18.460
<v Speaker 2>the population has done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

749
00:32:18.461 --> 00:32:19.920
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should I ever even really be doing this?</v>

750
00:32:19.921 --> 00:32:22.390
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through my research I found out this</v>

751
00:32:22.391 --> 00:32:24.470
<v Speaker 2>population of Caribou was really sick</v>
<v Speaker 2>lick.</v>

752
00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:28.480
<v Speaker 2>And as they fall really low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thrive.</v>

753
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.040
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the best times for the</v>

754
00:32:30.041 --> 00:32:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Caribou.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And actually when their populations are</v>

755
00:32:32.171 --> 00:32:34.270
<v Speaker 2>at a huge boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do the worst.</v>

756
00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:35.240
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

757
00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.200
<v Speaker 2>I wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they too much of the lichens.</v>

758
00:32:37.201 --> 00:32:38.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just,</v>

759
00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:41.030
<v Speaker 2>their resource just starts to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>overlaid in,</v>

760
00:32:41.031 --> 00:32:42.860
<v Speaker 2>then they have another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another Boston.</v>

761
00:32:42.861 --> 00:32:43.790
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

762
00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:45.970
<v Speaker 2>so I went and did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>

763
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:49.490
<v Speaker 2>there's a constant ying and Yang and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as a hunter,</v>

764
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.410
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a vegetarian,</v>

765
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.560
<v Speaker 2>even if you want to claim veganism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things,</v>

766
00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.320
<v Speaker 2>we should be asking ourselves big</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>

767
00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:00.020
<v Speaker 2>This whole thing that everything lives</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in a gray area.</v>

768
00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:02.660
<v Speaker 2>There is no black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not against vegetarians and not</v>

769
00:33:02.661 --> 00:33:05.210
<v Speaker 2>against vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a Vegan comes up to me and says,</v>

770
00:33:05.211 --> 00:33:08.330
<v Speaker 2>how in the hell can you kill an animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wear leather shoes?</v>

771
00:33:08.331 --> 00:33:10.070
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

772
00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:13.070
<v Speaker 2>that's a really good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd let me ask myself cause I'm going to</v>

773
00:33:13.071 --> 00:33:16.700
<v Speaker 2>have to sit down in a quiet float tank</v>
<v Speaker 2>and think about myself.</v>

774
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Like what I should be asking myself some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these big questions.</v>

775
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:20.900
<v Speaker 2>And as it should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

776
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:24.860
<v Speaker 2>I just think there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>information that we should keep asking</v>

777
00:33:24.861 --> 00:33:27.350
<v Speaker 2>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep asking ourselves because if the</v>

778
00:33:27.351 --> 00:33:30.440
<v Speaker 2>population of human beings continues</v>
<v Speaker 2>exponentially,</v>

779
00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:33.230
<v Speaker 2>which it will until this major event</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>

780
00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:35.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everyone thinks is calming</v>

781
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:41.240
<v Speaker 2>hunters should almost be the first ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>to give up hunting.</v>

782
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.370
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it trends towards that someday.</v>

783
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:44.390
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it gets to be,</v>

784
00:33:44.391 --> 00:33:49.391
<v Speaker 2>there's not enough wildlife or wild</v>
<v Speaker 2>lands or something fantastic happens.</v>

785
00:33:49.671 --> 00:33:53.420
<v Speaker 2>Like hunters should be the first ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should be on the front line of</v>

786
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:57.260
<v Speaker 2>being aware of the habitat and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources and say,</v>

787
00:33:57.261 --> 00:33:57.831
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

788
00:33:57.831 --> 00:33:59.630
<v Speaker 2>we need to back off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

789
00:33:59.631 --> 00:34:00.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen it before.</v>

790
00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:02.060
<v Speaker 2>It's actually really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Few,</v>

791
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.310
<v Speaker 2>few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a micro instance,</v>

792
00:34:04.311 --> 00:34:07.070
<v Speaker 2>but a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually a few years ago,</v>

793
00:34:07.071 --> 00:34:09.200
<v Speaker 2>I say it's long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1991,</v>

794
00:34:09.201 --> 00:34:12.410
<v Speaker 2>a huge blizzard hit in Wisconsin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

795
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.240
<v Speaker 2>on Halloween Day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

796
00:34:14.241 --> 00:34:17.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Wisconsin deer hunters association</v>

797
00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.480
<v Speaker 2>shut down whitetail hunting overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

798
00:34:20.481 --> 00:34:23.450
<v Speaker 2>there is no deer hunting this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's canceled.</v>

799
00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.700
<v Speaker 2>It's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no legal deer hunting this year.</v>

800
00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.450
<v Speaker 2>And then all of these deer hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're taking their tractors out on these</v>

801
00:34:29.451 --> 00:34:34.451
<v Speaker 2>public lands and on their private lands</v>
<v Speaker 2>and plowing areas for the deer to walk</v>

802
00:34:35.121 --> 00:34:36.410
<v Speaker 2>around in the deer to move around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

803
00:34:36.411 --> 00:34:39.200
<v Speaker 2>and so there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all sorts of instances about it.</v>

804
00:34:39.201 --> 00:34:42.740
<v Speaker 2>But you get what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to keep asking ourselves</v>

805
00:34:42.741 --> 00:34:45.590
<v Speaker 2>these questions as we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we move through our time and space.</v>

806
00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.780
<v Speaker 1>I think it's real important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you said about,</v>

807
00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:50.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're essentially saying is that</v>

808
00:34:50.211 --> 00:34:51.570
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

809
00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:55.340
<v Speaker 1>and this is always been my problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that proselytize or people that</v>

810
00:34:55.341 --> 00:34:56.174
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

811
00:34:56.210 --> 00:35:01.210
<v Speaker 1>that are really into proclaiming that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the moral high ground because</v>

812
00:35:01.431 --> 00:35:04.640
<v Speaker 1>they only vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That high ground is filled with holes.</v>

813
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.090
<v Speaker 1>You're going to step in one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>holes if you keep talking because the</v>

814
00:35:08.091 --> 00:35:11.270
<v Speaker 1>more angry you get at people that hunt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the more angry you get,</v>

815
00:35:11.271 --> 00:35:14.120
<v Speaker 1>the people that eat meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand that if you're</v>

816
00:35:14.121 --> 00:35:17.030
<v Speaker 1>eating vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just by fact that you're buying them</v>

817
00:35:17.031 --> 00:35:19.970
<v Speaker 1>from a factory farm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're buying them from large scale</v>

818
00:35:19.971 --> 00:35:22.880
<v Speaker 1>agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're absolutely responsible for death</v>

819
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.850
<v Speaker 1>and the death of fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you brought that up because</v>

820
00:35:25.851 --> 00:35:28.880
<v Speaker 1>those dead zones in the ocean that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a gigantic problem.</v>

821
00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

822
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:33.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a gigantic problem and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem that is caused in large</v>

823
00:35:33.621 --> 00:35:35.810
<v Speaker 1>part by large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large scale agriculture.</v>

824
00:35:35.811 --> 00:35:39.030
<v Speaker 1>As you said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that one of these problems is</v>

825
00:35:39.031 --> 00:35:42.510
<v Speaker 1>going to be solved by factory created</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet.</v>

826
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.440
<v Speaker 1>The problem is how many other problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be created by that?</v>

827
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:50.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't even mean jen like made me like</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of soy.</v>

828
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

829
00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:51.580
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

830
00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:52.161
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

831
00:35:52.161 --> 00:35:57.161
<v Speaker 1>they're making meat in laboratories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laboratory created meat and they're</v>

832
00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:59.130
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

833
00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:00.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what the process</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

834
00:36:00.901 --> 00:36:04.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's flesh cellular base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the first thing that they</v>

835
00:36:04.261 --> 00:36:04.980
<v Speaker 1>find?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Patriot,</v>

836
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.850
<v Speaker 1>essentially they're cloning beef and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these different things and the ideas</v>

837
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.160
<v Speaker 1>that they're going to be able to do this</v>
<v Speaker 1>without anything dying it.</v>

838
00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.590
<v Speaker 1>So if you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think our population,</v>

839
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.350
<v Speaker 1>if you think our human growth is</v>
<v Speaker 1>exponential now,</v>

840
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:22.620
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we can get rid of the land now we</v>

841
00:36:22.621 --> 00:36:23.670
<v Speaker 1>don't need the land now.</v>

842
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:27.930
<v Speaker 1>There's no value for wild places and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no value even for farms.</v>

843
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Now we can get rid of all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And billionaires,</v>

844
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 1>billionaires off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love money and so billionaires will</v>

845
00:36:33.961 --> 00:36:36.420
<v Speaker 1>buy up all this land because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>already have all the money to buy the</v>

846
00:36:36.421 --> 00:36:37.770
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll buy the land,</v>

847
00:36:37.771 --> 00:36:41.490
<v Speaker 1>they'll get the farms and they'll get</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the wild places out and they'll</v>

848
00:36:41.491 --> 00:36:45.240
<v Speaker 1>build even more houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can eat some beige colored</v>

849
00:36:45.241 --> 00:36:49.950
<v Speaker 1>grool or laboratory design meet and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get even more people.</v>

850
00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Well I don't think they're thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it that way.</v>

851
00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so I just invented something.</v>

852
00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:54.890
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

853
00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:56.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>

854
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:59.640
<v Speaker 1>it's like the idea of they like they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do this and then,</v>

855
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:04.670
<v Speaker 1>well they're us and there's wildlife and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild lands are protected.</v>

856
00:37:05.071 --> 00:37:10.071
<v Speaker 1>There's federal land and you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really build factory farmed meat houses</v>

857
00:37:10.141 --> 00:37:10.980
<v Speaker 1>on those places.</v>

858
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:13.980
<v Speaker 1>But now I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's also the real problem with</v>

859
00:37:13.981 --> 00:37:15.500
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

860
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.630
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no free ride.</v>

861
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Like what happens when you make that</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat?</v>

862
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's that time asking you?</v>

863
00:37:22.261 --> 00:37:24.030
<v Speaker 1>What's the first thing in the Petri</v>
<v Speaker 1>dish?</v>

864
00:37:24.031 --> 00:37:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's the cost of doing this also,</v>

865
00:37:26.101 --> 00:37:28.710
<v Speaker 1>is there some sort of a side effect to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating that meat?</v>

866
00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it have negative health effects?</v>

867
00:37:30.961 --> 00:37:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Is it have a negative environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect?</v>

868
00:37:33.301 --> 00:37:36.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there any sort of like waste product</v>

869
00:37:36.211 --> 00:37:39.030
<v Speaker 1>that's created by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by creating this meat?</v>

870
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are all questions that have to be</v>

871
00:37:41.221 --> 00:37:44.160
<v Speaker 1>answered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of it's clean now.</v>

872
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.940
<v Speaker 1>This is what's really important to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you run an Arrow through a bull elk</v>

873
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.470
<v Speaker 1>and that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

874
00:37:49.471 --> 00:37:53.430
<v Speaker 1>runs 20 yards and falls down and dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this weird feeling that you</v>

875
00:37:53.431 --> 00:37:56.160
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a weird feeling of loss</v>

876
00:37:56.370 --> 00:38:00.330
<v Speaker 1>that goes along with this weird feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>of happiness that you're successful.</v>

877
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:01.500
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not,</v>

878
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.710
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no like one or zero.</v>

879
00:38:04.711 --> 00:38:06.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not a binary experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

880
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:09.240
<v Speaker 1>it's not clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like life itself.</v>

881
00:38:09.241 --> 00:38:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Life eats life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to claim the moral high</v>

882
00:38:13.381 --> 00:38:16.650
<v Speaker 1>ground because you're a vegetarian or if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to claim the moral high ground</v>

883
00:38:16.651 --> 00:38:18.600
<v Speaker 1>because you're a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

884
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:23.840
<v Speaker 1>I think you're missing the big picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is all this weirdness to life and</v>

885
00:38:24.451 --> 00:38:29.451
<v Speaker 1>that there is this thing that we do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we consume and that every other animal</v>

886
00:38:30.181 --> 00:38:33.540
<v Speaker 1>does as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that always strikes me</v>

887
00:38:33.541 --> 00:38:35.870
<v Speaker 1>as being strange is the</v>

888
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:40.510
<v Speaker 3>people have a real hard time with people</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating predators are people hunting</v>

889
00:38:40.511 --> 00:38:45.220
<v Speaker 3>predators like bear hunting is one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number one,</v>

890
00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:49.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most sure fire ways to get people angry</v>

891
00:38:49.131 --> 00:38:50.770
<v Speaker 3>at you online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

892
00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.880
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of ignorance attached to</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

893
00:38:52.881 --> 00:38:56.080
<v Speaker 3>particularly with black bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which are responsible for literally</v>

894
00:38:56.081 --> 00:38:58.820
<v Speaker 3>killing 50% of all the moose calves and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>

895
00:38:58.821 --> 00:39:01.090
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the deer fawns and elk calves.</v>

896
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.520
<v Speaker 3>50% of them get whacked by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by black.</v>

897
00:39:03.521 --> 00:39:05.350
<v Speaker 3>They're very successful at calving</v>
<v Speaker 3>season.</v>

898
00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

899
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.593
<v Speaker 3>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

900
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.200
<v Speaker 3>how strong is their nose?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's some,</v>

901
00:39:08.201 --> 00:39:12.930
<v Speaker 3>it's like a bloodhound is thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 3>times stronger scent.</v>

902
00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:16.870
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then a or then us and then a black</v>

903
00:39:16.871 --> 00:39:21.871
<v Speaker 3>bear measurably above that measure be</v>
<v Speaker 3>above this so they can smell like,</v>

904
00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.800
<v Speaker 3>the way I try to explain it to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

905
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:26.840
<v Speaker 3>you know how you smell skunk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're driving your car,</v>

906
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.800
<v Speaker 3>you can smell it as fucking skunk for</v>
<v Speaker 3>blocks.</v>

907
00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Now a black bear can do that with your</v>
<v Speaker 3>foot odor.</v>

908
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.010
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

909
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Literally can smell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can smell the mustard on a hamburger</v>

910
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.800
<v Speaker 3>and pick it out from the beef and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>pickles.</v>

911
00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:46.030
<v Speaker 3>It's even better than that because some</v>
<v Speaker 3>biologists are surmising that they</v>

912
00:39:46.031 --> 00:39:48.580
<v Speaker 3>actually can tell time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put their nose.</v>

913
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:49.930
<v Speaker 3>So when they walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

914
00:39:49.931 --> 00:39:51.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you and I are driving on the road</v>

915
00:39:51.251 --> 00:39:52.380
<v Speaker 3>and we go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

916
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.310
<v Speaker 3>you smell that skunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

917
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.740
<v Speaker 3>he sitting there as he strolls through</v>
<v Speaker 3>the neighborhood,</v>

918
00:39:56.741 --> 00:39:57.700
<v Speaker 3>he's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

919
00:39:57.701 --> 00:40:01.900
<v Speaker 3>A skunk was hit by a car this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yesterday a little fat kid threw a</v>

920
00:40:01.901 --> 00:40:05.710
<v Speaker 3>cheeseburger out of the window here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And two days ago a woman with really</v>

921
00:40:05.711 --> 00:40:07.780
<v Speaker 3>strong perfume walked down the sidewalk</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a poodle.</v>

922
00:40:07.781 --> 00:40:11.050
<v Speaker 3>So they are literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so many layers to what they're</v>

923
00:40:11.051 --> 00:40:13.320
<v Speaker 3>taking in and everything has it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

924
00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.420
<v Speaker 3>essentially like different strengths</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of how long it's been president</v>

925
00:40:16.421 --> 00:40:20.590
<v Speaker 3>of the area that they can almost kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>read a book as they're strolling through</v>

926
00:40:20.591 --> 00:40:21.424
<v Speaker 3>their environment.</v>

927
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:23.500
<v Speaker 3>And so it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do they know that they can do that?</v>

928
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:27.880
<v Speaker 3>I think they're just making a summations</v>
<v Speaker 3>off of like how powerful their noses are</v>

929
00:40:27.881 --> 00:40:31.000
<v Speaker 3>and that they're picking up so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>information that they're picking up old</v>

930
00:40:31.001 --> 00:40:32.830
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>current information,</v>

931
00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:34.770
<v Speaker 3>brand new information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

932
00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.280
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean,</v>

933
00:40:36.281 --> 00:40:39.010
<v Speaker 3>if you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of that information coming in their</v>

934
00:40:39.011 --> 00:40:41.170
<v Speaker 3>head in an instant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every instant,</v>

935
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:44.860
<v Speaker 3>every time they breathe in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that I think scientists are probably</v>

936
00:40:44.861 --> 00:40:47.890
<v Speaker 3>making a summation that these bears have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to processes information as they're</v>

937
00:40:47.891 --> 00:40:49.810
<v Speaker 3>going through because otherwise they'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>run scared.</v>

938
00:40:49.811 --> 00:40:50.710
<v Speaker 3>I'll all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

939
00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:53.140
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're incredible animals.</v>

940
00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.630
<v Speaker 3>But it's interesting how many delicious</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are.</v>

941
00:40:55.631 --> 00:40:57.820
<v Speaker 3>They good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are they delicious?</v>

942
00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:00.070
<v Speaker 3>People don't want to hear that though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You eat bears.</v>

943
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You eat a bear.</v>

944
00:41:01.181 --> 00:41:05.620
<v Speaker 3>So I have this thing where I've hunted</v>
<v Speaker 3>with several hunting guides,</v>

945
00:41:05.621 --> 00:41:09.760
<v Speaker 3>several bear hunting guides where I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>convinced they've never eaten bear meat.</v>

946
00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.250
<v Speaker 3>Some of these guys that are guides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they send them meat home with their</v>

947
00:41:12.251 --> 00:41:13.840
<v Speaker 3>clients where they get it or they donate</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

948
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.370
<v Speaker 3>But I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you guys ever eaten,</v>

949
00:41:15.371 --> 00:41:16.021
<v Speaker 3>bear me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

950
00:41:16.021 --> 00:41:17.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they mean the bears here,</v>

951
00:41:17.321 --> 00:41:17.811
<v Speaker 3>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

952
00:41:17.811 --> 00:41:19.150
<v Speaker 3>like worms and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

953
00:41:19.151 --> 00:41:20.620
<v Speaker 3>they're fat as yellow in there and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

954
00:41:20.621 --> 00:41:22.420
<v Speaker 3>and I say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're full of crap.</v>

955
00:41:22.421 --> 00:41:25.900
<v Speaker 3>And so I did a hunt two years ago with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very dear friend of mine.</v>

956
00:41:25.901 --> 00:41:28.990
<v Speaker 3>I won't mention his name cause he'd be</v>
<v Speaker 3>mortified as he should be.</v>

957
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:30.303
<v Speaker 3>But I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

958
00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:32.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's eat some bears.</v>

959
00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:32.760
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when,</v>

960
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 3>when I get there and we kill</v>

961
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.730
<v Speaker 2>a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>

962
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.260
<v Speaker 2>what if you don't kill a bear?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

963
00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:39.110
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a few bear hunts before me.</v>

964
00:41:39.111 --> 00:41:40.590
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>

965
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:43.400
<v Speaker 2>he kills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very old bears.</v>

966
00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:45.850
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please save the ratty.</v>

967
00:41:45.851 --> 00:41:49.400
<v Speaker 2>Just bear that you kill for us the</v>
<v Speaker 2>oldest,</v>

968
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.550
<v Speaker 2>nastiest looking bore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please save,</v>

969
00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.433
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

970
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:56.750
<v Speaker 2>ask the archer or the hunter if we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>steal one of his hindquarters.</v>

971
00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:59.060
<v Speaker 2>And he did and he let us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when we got there,</v>

972
00:41:59.061 --> 00:42:01.640
<v Speaker 2>he pulled it out of the trash bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had in a trash bag in there and</v>

973
00:42:01.641 --> 00:42:05.280
<v Speaker 2>they're hanging cooler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He pulled out of the trash bag and that</v>

974
00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:08.060
<v Speaker 2>the fat was yellow and it looked</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>

975
00:42:08.061 --> 00:42:10.850
<v Speaker 2>And he told me that when he was skinny</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he actually saw some worms</v>

976
00:42:10.851 --> 00:42:11.810
<v Speaker 2>underneath the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

977
00:42:11.811 --> 00:42:13.290
<v Speaker 2>the high devs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

978
00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:14.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

979
00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:15.980
<v Speaker 2>it's a constant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

980
00:42:15.981 --> 00:42:20.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we made it that night along with some</v>

981
00:42:20.451 --> 00:42:22.610
<v Speaker 2>big horn sheep and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

982
00:42:22.611 --> 00:42:25.760
<v Speaker 2>which is fantastic eating and all of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>big horn,</v>

983
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:27.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>several pieces of the big Horn river</v>

984
00:42:27.271 --> 00:42:27.650
<v Speaker 2>left.</v>

985
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:31.640
<v Speaker 2>The bear was long gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was absolutely amazing.</v>

986
00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.640
<v Speaker 2>And guys cook it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

987
00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.910
<v Speaker 2>we did it two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

988
00:42:34.911 --> 00:42:38.360
<v Speaker 2>one day or one way we did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause we were kind of having a dinner</v>

989
00:42:38.361 --> 00:42:40.790
<v Speaker 2>party at a cabin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we may just these little tiny</v>

990
00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:42.680
<v Speaker 2>medallions and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

991
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:44.780
<v Speaker 2>it was really funny to his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his reaction.</v>

992
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:49.490
<v Speaker 2>So then we just pan seared it with</v>
<v Speaker 2>butter and garlic and onions and just</v>

993
00:42:49.491 --> 00:42:52.280
<v Speaker 2>ate at like little whatever chicken</v>
<v Speaker 2>mcnuggets if you will.</v>

994
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:53.750
<v Speaker 2>And he ate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he's like,</v>

995
00:42:53.751 --> 00:42:54.081
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

996
00:42:54.081 --> 00:42:58.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean you combine anything with butter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and onions and garlic and it's going to</v>

997
00:42:58.341 --> 00:42:59.090
<v Speaker 2>taste good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

998
00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:00.710
<v Speaker 2>do you hear yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

999
00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:02.150
<v Speaker 2>it's going up to a chef and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1000
00:43:02.151 --> 00:43:06.070
<v Speaker 2>you made me codfish but use dill and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manet's and yeah,</v>

1001
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.060
<v Speaker 2>you're a little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a liar.</v>

1002
00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:09.330
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so,</v>

1003
00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:12.590
<v Speaker 2>so then that night we made this big</v>
<v Speaker 2>roast and we seared it all sides,</v>

1004
00:43:12.591 --> 00:43:12.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1005
00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.530
<v Speaker 2>And seasoned it all up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made a nice robin and put it in this</v>

1006
00:43:15.531 --> 00:43:18.060
<v Speaker 2>broth with vegetables and everything and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate that.</v>

1007
00:43:18.061 --> 00:43:18.891
<v Speaker 2>And then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1008
00:43:18.891 --> 00:43:20.750
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you made a rob and you sear it.</v>

1009
00:43:20.751 --> 00:43:21.201
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1010
00:43:21.201 --> 00:43:23.480
<v Speaker 2>if you suck at cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the bears fault.</v>

1011
00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Like bear meat's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not telling you to eat it raw off</v>

1012
00:43:26.541 --> 00:43:28.430
<v Speaker 2>his skeleton the moment you're skinning</v>
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1013
00:43:28.431 --> 00:43:30.890
<v Speaker 2>But if you take the time to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1014
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:34.700
<v Speaker 2>prepare the flesh when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're in the field and then cook</v>

1015
00:43:34.701 --> 00:43:35.534
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1016
00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.820
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's right up there with anything you're</v>

1017
00:43:37.821 --> 00:43:39.800
<v Speaker 2>dealing with is internal biases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1018
00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:40.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1019
00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.670
<v Speaker 2>he's got these biases and he's just had</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and held onto them forever.</v>

1020
00:43:43.671 --> 00:43:44.930
<v Speaker 2>And especially if you're skinning</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1021
00:43:44.931 --> 00:43:48.290
<v Speaker 2>you see worms didn't get grossed out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you already think it's weird.</v>

1022
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:53.060
<v Speaker 2>I know Rinella told me a story once</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a bear that he shot and killed and</v>

1023
00:43:53.061 --> 00:43:55.010
<v Speaker 2>was cooking on a friend smoker.</v>

1024
00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:56.630
<v Speaker 2>And he told the friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

1025
00:43:56.631 --> 00:43:57.441
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

1026
00:43:57.441 --> 00:43:59.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to clean that fucking smoker</v>

1027
00:43:59.481 --> 00:44:00.350
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the guy's like,</v>

1028
00:44:00.351 --> 00:44:01.131
<v Speaker 2>were you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1029
00:44:01.131 --> 00:44:02.440
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's smoker,</v>

1030
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:04.040
<v Speaker 2>smelled like fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

1031
00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:06.680
<v Speaker 2>I'd never cooked the fish on that smoker</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

1032
00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you talking about?</v>

1033
00:44:08.271 --> 00:44:12.050
<v Speaker 2>And he's realizing that the bear that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed had just been eating nothing but</v>

1034
00:44:12.051 --> 00:44:12.800
<v Speaker 2>fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1035
00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:16.040
<v Speaker 2>And he said that when he was eating it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a like eating smoked fish.</v>

1036
00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:17.990
<v Speaker 2>Like it was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1037
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:21.060
<v Speaker 2>But it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was this weird taste because it</v>

1038
00:44:21.061 --> 00:44:23.390
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're eating this red meat that tastes</v>

1039
00:44:23.391 --> 00:44:25.880
<v Speaker 2>like smoked fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's wicked.</v>

1040
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:28.970
<v Speaker 2>They're awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're awesome if you had a blueberry</v>

1041
00:44:28.971 --> 00:44:29.804
<v Speaker 2>bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>

1042
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 2>I've never had that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard of the most incredible meet</v>

1043
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.690
<v Speaker 1>on the planet earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1044
00:44:33.691 --> 00:44:35.380
<v Speaker 1>I got dropped off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1045
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:36.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five,</v>

1046
00:44:36.421 --> 00:44:37.680
<v Speaker 1>six years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in the Arctic,</v>

1047
00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 30 or so days in the pilot dropped</v>

1048
00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:41.640
<v Speaker 1>us off and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1049
00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:43.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a bear tag?</v>

1050
00:44:43.861 --> 00:44:44.490
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1051
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I have a bear tag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

1052
00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:46.770
<v Speaker 1>if you kill a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1053
00:44:46.771 --> 00:44:48.690
<v Speaker 1>just tons of bears where I'm dropping</v>
<v Speaker 1>you off.</v>

1054
00:44:48.691 --> 00:44:50.250
<v Speaker 1>And he's like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tons of grizzlies,</v>

1055
00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:52.380
<v Speaker 1>tons of black bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is uncommon.</v>

1056
00:44:52.381 --> 00:44:54.270
<v Speaker 1>But he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you kill a black bear,</v>

1057
00:44:54.271 --> 00:44:55.650
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't want the meat,</v>

1058
00:44:55.651 --> 00:44:56.461
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1059
00:44:56.461 --> 00:44:59.100
<v Speaker 1>He'd made it very clear before he even</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped us off and I said,</v>

1060
00:44:59.101 --> 00:44:59.934
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

1061
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.841
<v Speaker 1>we'll keep it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we'll,</v>

1062
00:45:00.841 --> 00:45:03.300
<v Speaker 1>we'll share with you for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll definitely share some with you,</v>

1063
00:45:03.301 --> 00:45:05.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1064
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Rinella was telling me that it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally the greatest meat on earth.</v>

1065
00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Like when you have a bear that's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating nothing but blueberries,</v>

1066
00:45:12.271 --> 00:45:15.000
<v Speaker 1>and he did a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an episode immediate or once we shot</v>

1067
00:45:15.001 --> 00:45:16.710
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as he's opening it up,</v>

1068
00:45:16.711 --> 00:45:18.450
<v Speaker 1>you see purple fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1069
00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.790
<v Speaker 1>because the bears have been eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>blueberries for so long.</v>

1070
00:45:20.791 --> 00:45:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Their fat is purple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it made me think about my own diet</v>

1071
00:45:24.001 --> 00:45:27.270
<v Speaker 1>quite honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if this thing tastes so good and</v>

1072
00:45:27.271 --> 00:45:29.310
<v Speaker 1>smell so good because of what it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>

1073
00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:32.520
<v Speaker 1>if you're eating like fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheeseburgers and fries,</v>

1074
00:45:32.521 --> 00:45:35.820
<v Speaker 1>like that's gotta be in your fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get all that bullshit food,</v>

1075
00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking donuts that's gotta be in your</v>

1076
00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.880
<v Speaker 1>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you literally are what you eat.</v>

1077
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:44.850
<v Speaker 1>We know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you internalize it?</v>

1078
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:47.220
<v Speaker 1>I think when you see a bear that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>purple fat,</v>

1079
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe you internalize it even more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>

1080
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.641
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1081
00:45:50.641 --> 00:45:54.480
<v Speaker 1>anytime you're able to spend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1082
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:55.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1083
00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:56.520
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1084
00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.650
<v Speaker 1>you're dismantling and animal or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1085
00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:00.870
<v Speaker 1>You actually get to see these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1086
00:46:00.871 --> 00:46:04.620
<v Speaker 1>If you have this same perspective or</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherewithal that we were talking about a</v>

1087
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.120
<v Speaker 1>few minutes ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you sit there and go,</v>

1088
00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:06.811
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

1089
00:46:06.811 --> 00:46:08.790
<v Speaker 1>You're not just mindlessly skinning this</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear.</v>

1090
00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:12.060
<v Speaker 1>You're sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is my fat look like skittles?</v>

1091
00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pounded a bag of skittles yesterday.</v>

1092
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard they,</v>

1093
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:17.010
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are gross though.</v>

1094
00:46:17.011 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 1>If they've been eating like a rotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>moose,</v>

1095
00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:21.350
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you eat a bear that's been eating</v>

1096
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.190
<v Speaker 1>rotten meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's pretty fucking gross.</v>

1097
00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:26.190
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've eaten them and it was fine.</v>

1098
00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:28.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you ate one that ate or rotten</v>

1099
00:46:28.261 --> 00:46:29.790
<v Speaker 1>moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I've eaten one that is,</v>

1100
00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:31.650
<v Speaker 1>he was eating a rotten whale.</v>

1101
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.770
<v Speaker 1>The whale was like a whale was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>orange,</v>

1102
00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:39.540
<v Speaker 1>orange and yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do that,</v>

1103
00:46:39.541 --> 00:46:40.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a whale gets beached,</v>

1104
00:46:40.891 --> 00:46:44.570
<v Speaker 1>it dies like living it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll crawl right up inside of its rib</v>

1105
00:46:44.571 --> 00:46:47.700
<v Speaker 1>cage and they come out looking like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>sound too much hair gel and just</v>

1106
00:46:47.701 --> 00:46:52.110
<v Speaker 1>everything that's so foul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually good.</v>

1107
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:53.783
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1108
00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.500
<v Speaker 1>How did you cook it at?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same,</v>

1109
00:46:55.830 --> 00:46:58.710
<v Speaker 1>same way that actually I did more</v>
<v Speaker 1>medallions that way because I was</v>

1110
00:46:58.711 --> 00:47:00.570
<v Speaker 1>backpacking so I ate it right on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beach.</v>

1111
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.400
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about bear hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>

1112
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:06.570
<v Speaker 1>you're going up against years of movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1113
00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:11.600
<v Speaker 1>years of fucking Yogi and booboo and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have this weird perception of</v>

1114
00:47:13.891 --> 00:47:18.891
<v Speaker 1>what a bear is and we are the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>things they keep their population in</v>

1115
00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:22.380
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only things if you care about deer</v>

1116
00:47:22.381 --> 00:47:25.230
<v Speaker 1>and if you care about Moose and if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>care about other wildlife,</v>

1117
00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Predator control is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real problem there.</v>

1118
00:47:28.381 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 1>One of the most ethical animals are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really</v>

1119
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.500
<v Speaker 2>to hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of them there.</v>

1120
00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:33.850
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to like,</v>

1121
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:34.960
<v Speaker 2>you have to be careful though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1122
00:47:34.961 --> 00:47:38.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need to be controlled in certain</v>

1123
00:47:38.171 --> 00:47:39.010
<v Speaker 2>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain areas.</v>

1124
00:47:39.011 --> 00:47:41.290
<v Speaker 2>There's probably a decent balance cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of,</v>

1125
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of food,</v>

1126
00:47:43.001 --> 00:47:45.880
<v Speaker 2>so they might not be focusing on Moose</v>
<v Speaker 2>calves,</v>

1127
00:47:45.881 --> 00:47:47.710
<v Speaker 2>rakes or might not be a lot of moose or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1128
00:47:47.711 --> 00:47:49.810
<v Speaker 2>But in areas where there's great</v>
<v Speaker 2>overlap,</v>

1129
00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:51.820
<v Speaker 2>like it's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1130
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.580
<v Speaker 2>they don't get killed a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1131
00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:57.810
<v Speaker 2>And so people don't hunt them a lot in</v>
<v Speaker 2>general and,</v>

1132
00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1133
00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:02.230
<v Speaker 2>and people just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1134
00:48:02.231 --> 00:48:02.980
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1135
00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.070
<v Speaker 2>they instantly go to the ungulates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1136
00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.110
<v Speaker 2>Instantly go to the deer and the Moose</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Caribou,</v>

1137
00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:07.960
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1138
00:48:07.961 --> 00:48:11.200
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely need to be managed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The place I hunted,</v>

1139
00:48:11.201 --> 00:48:15.580
<v Speaker 2>I was bear hunting last week in BC and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the place I was hunting hasn't really</v>

1140
00:48:15.581 --> 00:48:17.170
<v Speaker 2>been hunted in like 10 years.</v>

1141
00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:22.620
<v Speaker 2>And you just know that these bears are</v>
<v Speaker 2>so terribly successful at stealing mule</v>

1142
00:48:22.901 --> 00:48:25.510
<v Speaker 2>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fawns and Moose calves in this area and,</v>

1143
00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:28.390
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen it before and you just see</v>

1144
00:48:28.391 --> 00:48:29.110
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1145
00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:31.690
<v Speaker 2>I killed a grizzly bear a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

1146
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:33.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say I killed it.</v>

1147
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:35.530
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it charged us.</v>

1148
00:48:35.531 --> 00:48:37.480
<v Speaker 2>And so the guy that I was with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had to shoot it.</v>

1149
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:38.980
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so he killed it.</v>

1150
00:48:38.981 --> 00:48:43.000
<v Speaker 2>But as soon as the bullet hit the bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he pooped out to,</v>

1151
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.550
<v Speaker 2>to call Moose calves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we had,</v>

1152
00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:48.970
<v Speaker 2>we had s we had seen a cow with two</v>
<v Speaker 2>calves,</v>

1153
00:48:48.971 --> 00:48:50.620
<v Speaker 2>two twins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

1154
00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:52.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just cruising up and down the</v>

1155
00:48:52.211 --> 00:48:53.050
<v Speaker 2>river.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he,</v>

1156
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.570
<v Speaker 2>he definitely got them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when we kill them,</v>

1157
00:48:55.571 --> 00:48:56.770
<v Speaker 2>he'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

1158
00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't even really thinking much about</v>

1159
00:48:59.291 --> 00:49:02.500
<v Speaker 2>it and just didn't have this wherewithal</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what was going on.</v>

1160
00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:05.050
<v Speaker 2>And it was kind of intense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1161
00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:08.740
<v Speaker 2>situation when it went down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But later on we were talking to the</v>

1162
00:49:08.741 --> 00:49:12.520
<v Speaker 2>biologist about it when we were having</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bear skull and hide and meet sealed</v>

1163
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:15.310
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we told him that he picked out a</v>

1164
00:49:15.311 --> 00:49:16.001
<v Speaker 2>calf and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1165
00:49:16.001 --> 00:49:18.370
<v Speaker 2>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there are grizzly bears and</v>

1166
00:49:18.371 --> 00:49:22.360
<v Speaker 2>black bears that are really successful</v>
<v Speaker 2>fon and calf killers.</v>

1167
00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:24.210
<v Speaker 2>And then there are others that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

1168
00:49:24.211 --> 00:49:26.140
<v Speaker 2>They're kind of individualistic like we</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

1169
00:49:26.141 --> 00:49:27.010
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so he's like,</v>

1170
00:49:27.011 --> 00:49:30.610
<v Speaker 2>it's really good that you're moving this</v>
<v Speaker 2>big old board who was a successful calf</v>

1171
00:49:30.611 --> 00:49:31.330
<v Speaker 2>killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause he,</v>

1172
00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:33.070
<v Speaker 2>he would just fixate on that in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>spring.</v>

1173
00:49:33.071 --> 00:49:36.250
<v Speaker 2>And really it does not take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of people might think,</v>

1174
00:49:36.251 --> 00:49:37.440
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's millions of Moose up.</v>

1175
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:38.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there aren't.</v>

1176
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.540
<v Speaker 2>And you go up in these areas like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1177
00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.340
<v Speaker 2>people ask me all the time when we're up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Alaska,</v>

1178
00:49:42.341 --> 00:49:43.174
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1179
00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:45.100
<v Speaker 2>when you get off the airplane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's got to be just animals</v>

1180
00:49:45.101 --> 00:49:45.934
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

1181
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:47.800
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no animals.</v>

1182
00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:51.010
<v Speaker 2>You get off the airplane in the Arctic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'd take a look around and there's</v>

1183
00:49:51.011 --> 00:49:53.950
<v Speaker 2>nothing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to go with no trees.</v>

1184
00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:55.540
<v Speaker 2>There's no trees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no moose.</v>

1185
00:49:55.541 --> 00:49:57.400
<v Speaker 2>There's no care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like you find them when you go</v>

1186
00:49:57.401 --> 00:49:59.320
<v Speaker 2>looking for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you find them when you find this</v>

1187
00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:03.730
<v Speaker 2>little micro niche of habitat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by and large,</v>

1188
00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.190
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing there because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1189
00:50:06.191 --> 00:50:11.020
<v Speaker 2>there's not a ton of resources there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like I think people think it's</v>

1190
00:50:11.021 --> 00:50:14.980
<v Speaker 2>the Serengeti and it and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if you have a successful grizzly</v>

1191
00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:17.950
<v Speaker 2>and he's preying on Moose and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular valley,</v>

1192
00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:21.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could really do some damage.</v>

1193
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:23.650
<v Speaker 2>And where I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just hunted mountain line for the</v>

1194
00:50:23.651 --> 00:50:27.530
<v Speaker 2>first time in BC this winter and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to the biologist cause I had</v>

1195
00:50:27.531 --> 00:50:31.160
<v Speaker 2>great contention about doing it and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed that,</v>

1196
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:33.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to run them with dogs.</v>

1197
00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:35.300
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to shoot it out of a bait</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a tree.</v>

1198
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:38.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had never interested me.</v>

1199
00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:43.400
<v Speaker 2>And so a buddy of mine just got his</v>
<v Speaker 2>first hunting concession in BC has been</v>

1200
00:50:43.401 --> 00:50:45.480
<v Speaker 2>a guide his whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he now has his own concession.</v>

1201
00:50:45.490 --> 00:50:48.770
<v Speaker 2>He has black bears and mule deer is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy that I was also just bear hunting</v>

1202
00:50:48.771 --> 00:50:49.431
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he said,</v>

1203
00:50:49.431 --> 00:50:51.650
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you come up and do a lion hunt?</v>

1204
00:50:51.651 --> 00:50:52.630
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no man,</v>

1205
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:54.050
<v Speaker 2>it's not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1206
00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.730
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1207
00:50:55.731 --> 00:50:57.170
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of being a hypocrite right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1208
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:58.041
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1209
00:50:58.041 --> 00:50:58.851
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1210
00:50:58.851 --> 00:51:00.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're always preaching that people</v>

1211
00:51:00.201 --> 00:51:03.560
<v Speaker 2>should ask themselves big questions and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people should kind of dive into,</v>

1212
00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:06.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this tornado or the storm and,</v>

1213
00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:10.520
<v Speaker 2>and experience things and ask themselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually challenge their thought</v>

1214
00:51:10.521 --> 00:51:10.940
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

1215
00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.040
<v Speaker 2>So who better to come up and go on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lion hunt?</v>

1216
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:16.340
<v Speaker 2>And if you have prejudice about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you come up and do it?</v>

1217
00:51:16.341 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 2>And so you can see if your prejudice are</v>
<v Speaker 2>real or,</v>

1218
00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:21.670
<v Speaker 2>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I did it and it was very eye</v>

1219
00:51:21.671 --> 00:51:23.600
<v Speaker 2>opening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an incredible experience.</v>

1220
00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:26.030
<v Speaker 2>What was eye opening about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1221
00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.800
<v Speaker 2>just the animals themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1222
00:51:27.801 --> 00:51:28.530
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1223
00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:31.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the enthusiasm around the hounds.</v>

1224
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of pictured this,</v>

1225
00:51:33.411 --> 00:51:34.244
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this,</v>

1226
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:36.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fox and the hound scenario built up in</v>

1227
00:51:36.831 --> 00:51:37.500
<v Speaker 2>my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1228
00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:41.720
<v Speaker 2>like it felt for the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same stereotypes that non hunters and</v>

1229
00:51:41.721 --> 00:51:43.090
<v Speaker 2>anti hundreds were falling forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1230
00:51:43.091 --> 00:51:44.660
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's hounds better kind of redneck.</v>

1231
00:51:44.661 --> 00:51:47.120
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there,</v>

1232
00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:49.160
<v Speaker 2>they treat their dogs like crap and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1233
00:51:49.161 --> 00:51:52.160
<v Speaker 2>and they're sending their dogs into this</v>
<v Speaker 2>line fight and it's,</v>

1234
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:55.430
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna get rough and these dogs are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get beat up and scarred up.</v>

1235
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:59.780
<v Speaker 2>And then finally you treat this lion and</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the hunter comes waltzing in with no,</v>

1236
00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:04.810
<v Speaker 2>no barrier of entry whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No physical suffering whatsoever.</v>

1237
00:52:04.941 --> 00:52:07.820
<v Speaker 2>No mental suffering whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comes waltzing in and shoots this thing</v>

1238
00:52:07.821 --> 00:52:12.821
<v Speaker 2>out of a tree and take some photos and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then skins at out leaves the flesh and</v>

1239
00:52:13.731 --> 00:52:17.000
<v Speaker 2>moves on with their life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I go up there and meet the hounds</v>

1240
00:52:17.001 --> 00:52:18.200
<v Speaker 2>men and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and first of all,</v>

1241
00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:20.900
<v Speaker 2>my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his name's Ben storic and um,</v>

1242
00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:23.140
<v Speaker 2>he's very gracious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunteries,</v>

1243
00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.130
<v Speaker 2>very aware.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's very kind to animals.</v>

1244
00:52:25.131 --> 00:52:28.730
<v Speaker 2>These has tremendous wherewithal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why we continue to hunt</v>

1245
00:52:28.731 --> 00:52:29.564
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>

1246
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:31.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I go up there and meet as Holland's</v>

1247
00:52:31.221 --> 00:52:32.300
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great guy.</v>

1248
00:52:32.301 --> 00:52:35.640
<v Speaker 2>His hounds are part of the family sleep</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the cabin with him,</v>

1249
00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.800
<v Speaker 2>great dog food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great medical care every single night</v>

1250
00:52:39.801 --> 00:52:41.900
<v Speaker 2>when we'd get home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1251
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:47.260
<v Speaker 2>in the scenario in which I killed the</v>
<v Speaker 2>line was also very rewarding for me as a</v>

1252
00:52:47.481 --> 00:52:47.900
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

1253
00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:50.120
<v Speaker 2>We tracked him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll use kilometers cause that's what we</v>

1254
00:52:50.121 --> 00:52:50.954
<v Speaker 2>were doing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1255
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:53.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tracked him for like 21,</v>

1256
00:52:53.901 --> 00:52:58.901
<v Speaker 2>22 kilometers just by his track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was really cool because this lion</v>

1257
00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:03.230
<v Speaker 2>had tore his back right track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was kind of like a movie.</v>

1258
00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:08.450
<v Speaker 2>We'd see his tracks in the snow and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always a dime sized spot of</v>

1259
00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:11.090
<v Speaker 2>blood in his track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was pretty cool cause we went and</v>

1260
00:53:11.091 --> 00:53:12.980
<v Speaker 2>spoke with some ranchers along this</v>
<v Speaker 2>river and they're like,</v>

1261
00:53:12.981 --> 00:53:13.814
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

1262
00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:18.290
<v Speaker 2>he's sport killing deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I didn't believe but I just want</v>

1263
00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:20.900
<v Speaker 2>to hear the ranchers a kind of summation</v>
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>

1264
00:53:20.901 --> 00:53:23.210
<v Speaker 2>And they didn't want him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ranchers where I was really</v>

1265
00:53:23.211 --> 00:53:24.890
<v Speaker 2>surprised with the wrench or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1266
00:53:24.891 --> 00:53:27.660
<v Speaker 2>we you to kill this cat because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1267
00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.460
<v Speaker 2>he sport killing these deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1268
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:32.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want ben to be very measured in how</v>

1269
00:53:32.221 --> 00:53:35.340
<v Speaker 2>he takes cats because they really love</v>
<v Speaker 2>cats in this area and they just want ben</v>

1270
00:53:35.341 --> 00:53:36.570
<v Speaker 2>to be cognizant of the animals.</v>

1271
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:37.760
<v Speaker 2>He removes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he has anyway.</v>

1272
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:42.060
<v Speaker 2>But they love cats just because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just love the idea of them being there,</v>

1273
00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:44.310
<v Speaker 2>the wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the symbolism of the wild.</v>

1274
00:53:44.311 --> 00:53:47.820
<v Speaker 2>And then all these ranchers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they raise cattle and they watch the</v>

1275
00:53:47.821 --> 00:53:49.350
<v Speaker 2>wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1276
00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:52.530
<v Speaker 2>harass their cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they watch the cats will literally</v>

1277
00:53:52.531 --> 00:53:56.490
<v Speaker 2>walk right through a calf pen and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cavs won't spend any,</v>

1278
00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:00.240
<v Speaker 2>they don't even look at the lion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cows aren't looking at the lion,</v>

1279
00:54:00.241 --> 00:54:04.290
<v Speaker 2>but the lion will just stroll right</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the pen and just carry on about</v>

1280
00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:05.760
<v Speaker 2>his day because he wants to kill a deer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sheet.</v>

1281
00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:07.560
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what he wants to fixate on.</v>

1282
00:54:07.561 --> 00:54:09.240
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want to deal probably with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mama Cow.</v>

1283
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:12.270
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we track the same for 22 kilometers.</v>

1284
00:54:12.271 --> 00:54:13.990
<v Speaker 2>We actually got down on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1285
00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:16.710
<v Speaker 2>on top of a mule deer killed that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>had made the night before.</v>

1286
00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bumped it and it ran way up into the</v>

1287
00:54:19.141 --> 00:54:21.750
<v Speaker 2>mountains and these and these hills and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tracked it all the way up there.</v>

1288
00:54:21.751 --> 00:54:25.740
<v Speaker 2>We tracked another four or five</v>
<v Speaker 2>kilometers and then that's when we</v>

1289
00:54:25.741 --> 00:54:30.741
<v Speaker 2>release the hounds and it was wicked to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the enthusiasm in the hounds.</v>

1290
00:54:30.841 --> 00:54:34.890
<v Speaker 2>Like I just pictured something that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be blood thirsty and like,</v>

1291
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:36.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1292
00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:40.140
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to rip this cat apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these hounds that the look on their</v>

1293
00:54:40.141 --> 00:54:41.280
<v Speaker 2>faces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm making,</v>

1294
00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.640
<v Speaker 2>making judgments here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the look on their faces were just</v>

1295
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.820
<v Speaker 2>pure enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a game.</v>

1296
00:54:48.030 --> 00:54:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Like our job is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the chase this cat down inside,</v>

1297
00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:54.510
<v Speaker 2>they've been trained and to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to get it in a tree,</v>

1298
00:54:54.511 --> 00:54:57.390
<v Speaker 2>like they're not sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to catch and kill this cat.</v>

1299
00:54:57.810 --> 00:55:00.210
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our job is to kind of get it in the</v>

1300
00:55:00.211 --> 00:55:00.510
<v Speaker 2>tree.</v>

1301
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:02.940
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just really cool to be around the</v>

1302
00:55:02.941 --> 00:55:05.910
<v Speaker 2>dogs and watched her energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they went and treated the line.</v>

1303
00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:08.670
<v Speaker 2>We snuck in on the line and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1304
00:55:08.671 --> 00:55:09.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't like it and see,</v>

1305
00:55:09.961 --> 00:55:13.710
<v Speaker 2>he jumped off and the dogs and sued,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pursued again and then we treat him</v>

1306
00:55:13.711 --> 00:55:16.410
<v Speaker 2>again and I killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And killing him was,</v>

1307
00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:19.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neither here nor there.</v>

1308
00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.910
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1309
00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:23.610
<v Speaker 2>it was just an act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

1310
00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a light switch for me.</v>

1311
00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:27.130
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1312
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Ben Needs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1313
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:31.020
<v Speaker 2>Ben had spoke with the biologists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted a certain amount of cats</v>

1314
00:55:31.021 --> 00:55:35.460
<v Speaker 2>removed from this area cause they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>really having predatory impact on the</v>

1315
00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.260
<v Speaker 2>sheep and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the deer.</v>

1316
00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:40.370
<v Speaker 2>And I kind of found out why afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I spoke to the biologist.</v>

1317
00:55:40.371 --> 00:55:41.200
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1318
00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:42.900
<v Speaker 2>we got him in three and ben just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1319
00:55:42.901 --> 00:55:46.470
<v Speaker 2>he's a big Tom and he's an old tom and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1320
00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.410
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to kill him anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you want to kill him,</v>

1321
00:55:49.411 --> 00:55:49.740
<v Speaker 2>kill him.</v>

1322
00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:50.820
<v Speaker 2>If not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to kill him.</v>

1323
00:55:50.821 --> 00:55:52.170
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they had tags to everything was</v>

1324
00:55:52.171 --> 00:55:53.550
<v Speaker 2>legal and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1325
00:55:53.551 --> 00:55:54.550
<v Speaker 2>I'll kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1326
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.220
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to take the process all the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>

1327
00:55:56.221 --> 00:55:57.780
<v Speaker 2>so I killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He died very quickly.</v>

1328
00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd always heard that their meat was</v>

1329
00:56:01.201 --> 00:56:02.490
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1330
00:56:02.491 --> 00:56:04.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd also heard people say it's on the,</v>

1331
00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:08.130
<v Speaker 2>so of course I don't kill anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless I'm going to eat it.</v>

1332
00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:08.964
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1333
00:56:09.090 --> 00:56:12.660
<v Speaker 2>we ate it and it was arguably the finest</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat I'd ever had in my life.</v>

1334
00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:14.370
<v Speaker 2>It's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rinella told me,</v>

1335
00:56:14.430 --> 00:56:16.620
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it tastes like pork you've ever had.</v>

1336
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even a big fan of pork.</v>

1337
00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:20.490
<v Speaker 2>Like I like pork,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was pork is okay.</v>

1338
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Mountain lion is like succulent flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep rich pork.</v>

1339
00:56:24.701 --> 00:56:27.090
<v Speaker 2>It's just absolutely unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1340
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:29.350
<v Speaker 2>their fat is supposed to be really good</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

1341
00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1342
00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:31.360
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1343
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.840
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1344
00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:33.910
<v Speaker 2>so it was just really rewarding</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience for me.</v>

1345
00:56:33.911 --> 00:56:35.530
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I got to hang out with the dogs</v>

1346
00:56:35.531 --> 00:56:37.120
<v Speaker 2>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I went and spoke with a</v>

1347
00:56:37.121 --> 00:56:39.910
<v Speaker 2>biologist that was eye opening as well</v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

1348
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:41.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hounds when we're with,</v>

1349
00:56:41.981 --> 00:56:44.260
<v Speaker 2>he kind of gets the cat to be like five</v>
<v Speaker 2>or six years old,</v>

1350
00:56:44.261 --> 00:56:46.480
<v Speaker 2>which would be very old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turned out to be three.</v>

1351
00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:52.410
<v Speaker 2>And which is amazing that they go from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>kitten to this thing was like 170 580</v>

1352
00:56:52.421 --> 00:56:53.890
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1353
00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:56.530
<v Speaker 2>and that big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that big and just three years.</v>

1354
00:56:56.531 --> 00:57:00.730
<v Speaker 2>And the biologist even told me he had</v>
<v Speaker 2>one come in earlier that year that was</v>

1355
00:57:00.731 --> 00:57:02.350
<v Speaker 2>over 200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like two oh two,</v>

1356
00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:04.210
<v Speaker 2>two or three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about as big as they get.</v>

1357
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:06.670
<v Speaker 2>And it was radio collared and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1358
00:57:06.671 --> 00:57:09.010
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be wicked because we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the radio collar,</v>

1359
00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be able to call the</v>
<v Speaker 2>biologist that radio collared this</v>

1360
00:57:11.711 --> 00:57:11.890
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1361
00:57:11.890 --> 00:57:14.410
<v Speaker 2>It's 200 pounds of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be like five or six,</v>

1362
00:57:14.411 --> 00:57:17.860
<v Speaker 2>seven years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He called the guy and the thing was,</v>

1363
00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:19.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just had barely leaves,</v>

1364
00:57:19.961 --> 00:57:24.340
<v Speaker 2>like just over two years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's already 200 pounds.</v>

1365
00:57:24.430 --> 00:57:25.930
<v Speaker 2>Two years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1366
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.780
<v Speaker 2>And they're just so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1367
00:57:27.781 --> 00:57:28.614
<v Speaker 2>and with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1368
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:30.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes aging dear aging bears is</v>

1369
00:57:30.881 --> 00:57:33.310
<v Speaker 2>kind of a tricky prospect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at the molar where,</v>

1370
00:57:33.311 --> 00:57:35.190
<v Speaker 2>and you're looking at their lateral and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sizes and they're,</v>

1371
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:36.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1372
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:41.230
<v Speaker 2>medial incisors and you're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>where and everything with the lions,</v>

1373
00:57:41.231 --> 00:57:46.231
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to see like they have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>age classes have distinct dental changes</v>

1374
00:57:47.411 --> 00:57:48.400
<v Speaker 2>that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

1375
00:57:48.401 --> 00:57:49.090
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1376
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:50.740
<v Speaker 2>there's kind of no middle ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

1377
00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:52.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course the radio collar they</v>

1378
00:57:52.511 --> 00:57:55.990
<v Speaker 2>knew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're just so terribly successful.</v>

1379
00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:59.440
<v Speaker 2>And just looking at the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>biomass they put on their bodies,</v>

1380
00:57:59.441 --> 00:58:03.070
<v Speaker 2>just their size and how they carry a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking forearms</v>

1381
00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:06.220
<v Speaker 2>arms or like a human thigh.</v>

1382
00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:08.140
<v Speaker 2>That's what freaked me out because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting there holding,</v>

1383
00:58:08.141 --> 00:58:11.320
<v Speaker 2>this thing's</v>
<v Speaker 2>gone out body,</v>

1384
00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:13.240
<v Speaker 2>it's going to wear to skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>skin and body.</v>

1385
00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:16.420
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it weighs the exact same as a deer.</v>

1386
00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Like it's the same thing as a deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the proportions are way off.</v>

1387
00:58:19.210 --> 00:58:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is so much shorter.</v>

1388
00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:22.780
<v Speaker 2>The meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1389
00:58:22.781 --> 00:58:26.020
<v Speaker 2>it goes all the way down to their paws</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they can jump,</v>

1390
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:28.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 feet out of a tree and land and just</v>

1391
00:58:28.391 --> 00:58:31.000
<v Speaker 2>like you and I would be rolling around</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the ground going,</v>

1392
00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:32.350
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at my femur.</v>

1393
00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:34.960
<v Speaker 2>And these guys just boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're off to the races and it's</v>

1394
00:58:34.961 --> 00:58:36.070
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1395
00:58:36.071 --> 00:58:37.830
<v Speaker 2>you drop it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weigh the same as the deer.</v>

1396
00:58:37.831 --> 00:58:40.330
<v Speaker 2>You drop a deer out of a train,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to have four broken legs.</v>

1397
00:58:40.331 --> 00:58:43.090
<v Speaker 2>These things just land and off to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>races,</v>

1398
00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:43.930
<v Speaker 2>the animals.</v>

1399
00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:45.250
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I was gonna say,</v>

1400
00:58:45.251 --> 00:58:48.940
<v Speaker 2>so the sport killing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the biologist told me where the area</v>

1401
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:51.640
<v Speaker 2>where there's a lot of wolves and so the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves,</v>

1402
00:58:51.670 --> 00:58:55.930
<v Speaker 2>the lines are so much more successful at</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing and the wolves that the wolves</v>

1403
00:58:55.931 --> 00:58:59.830
<v Speaker 2>just become somewhat lazy and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>get in these little packs and the</v>

1404
00:58:59.831 --> 00:59:01.840
<v Speaker 2>literally find a big Tom and they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>just follow him.</v>

1405
00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:06.460
<v Speaker 2>And so what this cat is doing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists have observed him killing</v>

1406
00:59:06.461 --> 00:59:10.210
<v Speaker 2>deer and he'll literally kill and cash</v>
<v Speaker 2>dear and sheep.</v>

1407
00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:13.480
<v Speaker 2>So that when the wolves find his caches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wolves will eat.</v>

1408
00:59:13.481 --> 00:59:18.070
<v Speaker 2>And so then he can now he can go and eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>in peace himself so he doesn't get</v>

1409
00:59:18.071 --> 00:59:20.500
<v Speaker 2>fucked with by the wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's leaving them food,</v>

1410
00:59:20.501 --> 00:59:23.570
<v Speaker 2>he's leaving them food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why the ranchers thought cause</v>

1411
00:59:23.571 --> 00:59:24.890
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he killed a deer and you didn't do</v>

1412
00:59:24.891 --> 00:59:25.370
<v Speaker 2>anything with it.</v>

1413
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:27.350
<v Speaker 2>He just killed a deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're like,</v>

1414
00:59:27.351 --> 00:59:27.531
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1415
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:28.370
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He killed a deer.</v>

1416
00:59:28.371 --> 00:59:30.110
<v Speaker 2>And it's funny cause when we tracked him</v>
<v Speaker 2>that day,</v>

1417
00:59:30.111 --> 00:59:33.890
<v Speaker 2>he brought us to nine kill sites that</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

1418
00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1419
00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:38.270
<v Speaker 2>So he's literally doing that while</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're chasing,</v>

1420
00:59:38.271 --> 00:59:38.841
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1421
00:59:38.841 --> 00:59:40.760
<v Speaker 2>just eat this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leave me the fuck alone.</v>

1422
00:59:40.761 --> 00:59:41.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as,</v>

1423
00:59:41.810 --> 00:59:45.050
<v Speaker 2>as you're tracking him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's tracking you pass spots,</v>

1424
00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.710
<v Speaker 2>hoping that you take his cash and leave</v>
<v Speaker 2>him alone.</v>

1425
00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1426
00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a fantastic experience.</v>

1427
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:55.310
<v Speaker 2>And then the biologist also told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

1428
00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:57.980
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of contention and I'll come</v>

1429
00:59:57.981 --> 00:59:59.590
<v Speaker 2>in here and hunting lions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had,</v>

1430
01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how successful they are at</v>

1431
01:00:02.171 --> 01:00:03.200
<v Speaker 2>repopulating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1432
01:00:03.201 --> 01:00:06.020
<v Speaker 2>we almost hunted them to extinction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the turn of the century and they're</v>

1433
01:00:06.021 --> 01:00:09.530
<v Speaker 2>just starting to kind of make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're starting to expand now back into</v>

1434
01:00:09.531 --> 01:00:11.270
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of their original territories.</v>

1435
01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's like,</v>

1436
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:13.821
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donnie,</v>

1437
01:00:13.821 --> 01:00:15.380
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a great animal to take.</v>

1438
01:00:15.381 --> 01:00:17.900
<v Speaker 2>This is an area that receives very</v>
<v Speaker 2>little lion hunting.</v>

1439
01:00:17.901 --> 01:00:20.750
<v Speaker 2>We have to take some of these lines out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he showed me data that they had on</v>

1440
01:00:20.751 --> 01:00:24.140
<v Speaker 2>this one lion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to misquote the data,</v>

1441
01:00:24.141 --> 01:00:27.800
<v Speaker 2>but basically the single line had</v>
<v Speaker 2>removed like nine or 11% of this</v>

1442
01:00:27.801 --> 01:00:29.510
<v Speaker 2>particular sheep herd in a year.</v>

1443
01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Just like boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

1444
01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:36.170
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this dude knew the game.</v>

1445
01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.620
<v Speaker 2>He knew where to kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knew how to kill and he had no</v>

1446
01:00:39.621 --> 01:00:40.490
<v Speaker 2>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1447
01:00:40.491 --> 01:00:42.470
<v Speaker 2>he's just a super pressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have no chance.</v>

1448
01:00:42.471 --> 01:00:44.030
<v Speaker 2>If he finds them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to kill them.</v>

1449
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The runs faster.</v>

1450
01:00:45.261 --> 01:00:46.790
<v Speaker 2>He's stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if he gets a hold of them,</v>

1451
01:00:46.791 --> 01:00:48.170
<v Speaker 2>they never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they never lose.</v>

1452
01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:51.110
<v Speaker 2>It's never like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a deer gets away.</v>

1453
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:51.601
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1454
01:00:51.601 --> 01:00:52.820
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they win every time.</v>

1455
01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:53.683
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>

1456
01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.600
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right on the same like,</v>

1457
01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same path.</v>

1458
01:00:56.661 --> 01:00:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Has all the predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1459
01:00:58.090 --> 01:00:58.923
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

1460
01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.180
<v Speaker 2>it leads to really good discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people get upset when you kill</v>

1461
01:01:02.181 --> 01:01:03.410
<v Speaker 2>predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get very upset.</v>

1462
01:01:03.411 --> 01:01:05.150
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really strange because they don't,</v>

1463
01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:08.870
<v Speaker 2>they don't have any problem with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator killing deer and they have less</v>

1464
01:01:08.871 --> 01:01:10.490
<v Speaker 2>problem with people killing deer.</v>

1465
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:13.790
<v Speaker 2>But they have a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People killing predators and I believe</v>

1466
01:01:13.791 --> 01:01:16.850
<v Speaker 2>it's the same problem they have with</v>
<v Speaker 2>like cecil the lion and shit like that.</v>

1467
01:01:16.851 --> 01:01:20.360
<v Speaker 2>They think that you're just doing it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be an asshole and you just want this</v>

1468
01:01:20.361 --> 01:01:22.850
<v Speaker 2>thing on your wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I went ahead on your wall.</v>

1469
01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.850
<v Speaker 2>I do have some contention and you tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and like,</v>

1470
01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.600
<v Speaker 2>like for instance like the grizzly bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue being shutdown and BC,</v>

1471
01:01:29.830 --> 01:01:33.420
<v Speaker 2>there's a bear grizzly bear hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you can explain that for me.</v>

1472
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:35.150
<v Speaker 2>People don't understand what's going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

1473
01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:35.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1474
01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.360
<v Speaker 2>so the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the British Columbia government</v>

1475
01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.980
<v Speaker 2>shutdown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>British Columbia,</v>

1476
01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:44.390
<v Speaker 2>British Columbia grizzly bear hunting</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they equated it and I guess</v>

1477
01:01:44.391 --> 01:01:46.460
<v Speaker 2>they're probably correct with trophy</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting,</v>

1478
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:50.300
<v Speaker 2>right to where it hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're killing these animals and just</v>

1479
01:01:50.301 --> 01:01:53.510
<v Speaker 2>taking the skulls and hides and leaving</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flush behind.</v>

1480
01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:54.973
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1481
01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.420
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never,</v>

1482
01:01:56.630 --> 01:02:00.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have I at Grizzly bear hunting NBC</v>

1483
01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.360
<v Speaker 2>wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was actually more on a sheep hunt.</v>

1484
01:02:02.361 --> 01:02:03.770
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1485
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just this notion of like,</v>

1486
01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:07.970
<v Speaker 2>like the gentleman that killed cecil the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lion,</v>

1487
01:02:07.971 --> 01:02:11.660
<v Speaker 2>like if you're really going to kill an</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal and,</v>

1488
01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:13.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just take its hide,</v>

1489
01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I've pretty significant issue with</v>

1490
01:02:16.461 --> 01:02:18.220
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like I,</v>

1491
01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.970
<v Speaker 2>I just hope hunters that</v>

1492
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>the guys are hunting the grizzly bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

1493
01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:26.930
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if this was more of a hunter</v>
<v Speaker 1>instilled issue then,</v>

1494
01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:29.070
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1495
01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>people are even bringing light into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause if people were killing grizzly</v>

1496
01:02:32.431 --> 01:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>bears in British Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking their hides,</v>

1497
01:02:35.070 --> 01:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>taking their skulls and taking all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flesh,</v>

1498
01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>I feel like we'd still be grizzly bear</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting in British Columbia.</v>

1499
01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe,</v>

1500
01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but grizzly bears are another notch up</v>

1501
01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>even above black bears in terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct.</v>

1502
01:02:49.381 --> 01:02:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rinella calls charismatic megafauna.</v>

1503
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>People love those things cause they</v>
<v Speaker 1>liked seeing them.</v>

1504
01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't have to deal with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're not like that,</v>

1505
01:02:57.860 --> 01:02:59.640
<v Speaker 1>a guy in ennis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado last year,</v>

1506
01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:02.910
<v Speaker 1>they've got his head cut open by one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have to deal with them,</v>

1507
01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:03.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1508
01:03:03.501 --> 01:03:06.720
<v Speaker 1>they are amazing to look at and we all</v>
<v Speaker 1>want them around.</v>

1509
01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they're an incredible animal,</v>

1510
01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:13.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's this thing of trophy hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These what you think of some fat,</v>

1511
01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Lazy ass hole with a rifle that stands</v>
<v Speaker 1>on top of a lion.</v>

1512
01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:19.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this image that I found online</v>

1513
01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:21.290
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at,</v>

1514
01:03:21.291 --> 01:03:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

1515
01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:25.380
<v Speaker 1>that's why people have a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>trophy hunters.</v>

1516
01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Axonify this fat fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who should never in a million years</v>

1517
01:03:30.661 --> 01:03:34.860
<v Speaker 1>without that rifle had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have ever the help or the help,</v>

1518
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:36.930
<v Speaker 1>especially the help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1519
01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no way he would've got on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1520
01:03:39.841 --> 01:03:41.600
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to who had got to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

1521
01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:43.650
<v Speaker 1>He must've got there in a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1522
01:03:43.651 --> 01:03:46.590
<v Speaker 1>and then they have this line in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's perched up on the line like he</v>

1523
01:03:46.591 --> 01:03:48.200
<v Speaker 1>did some amazing thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1524
01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:51.450
<v Speaker 1>And my my meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably one of those caged lines</v>

1525
01:03:51.451 --> 01:03:51.990
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

1526
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.650
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1527
01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:54.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have so many of those high fence</v>

1528
01:03:54.481 --> 01:03:57.930
<v Speaker 1>hunt where they let these lions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have them all caged up in a pen.</v>

1529
01:03:57.931 --> 01:04:01.830
<v Speaker 1>They throw a cows over the dead cows</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the pen,</v>

1530
01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.150
<v Speaker 1>over the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pen,</v>

1531
01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:08.040
<v Speaker 1>the lions tear them apart and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick one and take that one out into the</v>

1532
01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.520
<v Speaker 1>wilderness area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which all fenced in anyway.</v>

1533
01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:15.390
<v Speaker 1>And then they let it loose and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lions stays in the area because it has</v>

1534
01:04:15.391 --> 01:04:18.450
<v Speaker 1>no idea what its boundary is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what its territory is,</v>

1535
01:04:18.500 --> 01:04:20.130
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what other lines were in that area.</v>

1536
01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:23.940
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of times they sit still and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wait for awhile before they figure</v>

1537
01:04:23.941 --> 01:04:26.370
<v Speaker 1>out what their territory is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hunter comes in,</v>

1538
01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:27.960
<v Speaker 1>shoots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stands on,</v>

1539
01:04:27.961 --> 01:04:30.390
<v Speaker 1>it takes a picture of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just shot a pet.</v>

1540
01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:32.550
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you told me,</v>

1541
01:04:32.551 --> 01:04:33.181
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1542
01:04:33.181 --> 01:04:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I went into Tanzania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went into,</v>

1543
01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:39.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wildest part and uh,</v>

1544
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:44.100
<v Speaker 1>backpacked in and set up camp and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>there for 40 days and you know,</v>

1545
01:04:44.101 --> 01:04:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed an eight planes game and I worked</v>

1546
01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:49.020
<v Speaker 1>with the locals and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1547
01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.970
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shared meet with these different</v>

1548
01:04:50.971 --> 01:04:54.000
<v Speaker 1>tribes and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and man and we found a pride of lions</v>

1549
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:58.170
<v Speaker 1>and there was a giant main to mail and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was another sister pride over here</v>

1550
01:04:58.171 --> 01:04:58.770
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>

1551
01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:00.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we snuck in and we killed them.</v>

1552
01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:02.220
<v Speaker 1>We hunted him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we killed him,</v>

1553
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:04.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we skinned him out,</v>

1554
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:09.270
<v Speaker 1>we took his flesh and we went on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest hunt and we engage the wild here</v>

1555
01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:14.160
<v Speaker 1>and we were moved into animal wicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to read that book.</v>

1556
01:05:14.161 --> 01:05:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to see that film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to hear you.</v>

1557
01:05:15.901 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Tell me that story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does eat lions?</v>

1558
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1559
01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.020
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1560
01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:22.240
<v Speaker 2>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1561
01:05:22.241 --> 01:05:24.280
<v Speaker 2>I never even heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never been to Africa.</v>

1562
01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:30.030
<v Speaker 2>And if and if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what are we doing?</v>

1563
01:05:30.071 --> 01:05:31.720
<v Speaker 2>I understand killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there,</v>

1564
01:05:31.721 --> 01:05:32.350
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1565
01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:36.130
<v Speaker 2>there's some weirdness there too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause if you told me,</v>

1566
01:05:36.131 --> 01:05:37.390
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you called me and said,</v>

1567
01:05:37.391 --> 01:05:40.720
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna pay you $1 million,</v>

1568
01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.000
<v Speaker 2>I want you to come down to my</v>
<v Speaker 2>concession.</v>

1569
01:05:43.001 --> 01:05:45.580
<v Speaker 2>I get these offers daily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not $1 million,</v>

1570
01:05:45.581 --> 01:05:49.480
<v Speaker 2>but if you come down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you come down on my concession and</v>

1571
01:05:49.481 --> 01:05:52.510
<v Speaker 2>shoot a giraffe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just making this up,</v>

1572
01:05:52.511 --> 01:05:54.430
<v Speaker 2>but I'm trying to pick a zoo animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1573
01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:56.560
<v Speaker 2>you come down and shoot a giraffe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1574
01:05:56.561 --> 01:05:58.810
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to see come down and film this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Blah Blah and,</v>

1575
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:59.770
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1576
01:05:59.771 --> 01:06:02.890
<v Speaker 2>the is no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no explaining a concession to</v>

1577
01:06:02.891 --> 01:06:07.891
<v Speaker 2>people to this large areas that are most</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the time fenced in lot of thousands.</v>

1578
01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:10.510
<v Speaker 2>It's thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even tens of thousands of acres.</v>

1579
01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Like you're never going to see the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fence.</v>

1580
01:06:12.551 --> 01:06:15.380
<v Speaker 2>We could drive you around in there for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>week and you never see it.</v>

1581
01:06:15.381 --> 01:06:17.500
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless I'm my wild.</v>

1582
01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fence thing is very weird,</v>

1583
01:06:19.901 --> 01:06:21.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because like their habitat,</v>

1584
01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:24.580
<v Speaker 2>the fence essentially keeps people out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1585
01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:26.130
<v Speaker 2>It protects them from poachers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1586
01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:28.360
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily to trap the</v>

1587
01:06:28.361 --> 01:06:29.980
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although the animals can't leave.</v>

1588
01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:33.490
<v Speaker 2>It's to keep the poachers out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to preserve these areas because</v>

1589
01:06:33.491 --> 01:06:37.510
<v Speaker 2>people</v>
<v Speaker 2>with greed will take,</v>

1590
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.790
<v Speaker 2>they'll kill anything that get a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars in the marketplace for,</v>

1591
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:43.360
<v Speaker 2>for market meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then certainly to sell a hide to</v>

1592
01:06:43.361 --> 01:06:47.440
<v Speaker 2>maybe even a even more fat hunter that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or person that calls themselves a hunter</v>

1593
01:06:47.441 --> 01:06:50.560
<v Speaker 2>that wants a lion on their wall that</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't even want to engage in the</v>

1594
01:06:50.561 --> 01:06:51.191
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1595
01:06:51.191 --> 01:06:54.220
<v Speaker 2>They'll buy the skin or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's why there's trading tiger skins and</v>

1596
01:06:54.221 --> 01:06:54.790
<v Speaker 2>things like this.</v>

1597
01:06:54.790 --> 01:06:56.500
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1598
01:06:56.530 --> 01:06:58.180
<v Speaker 2>so in these concessions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so these,</v>

1599
01:06:58.181 --> 01:06:59.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you called me and said,</v>

1600
01:06:59.291 --> 01:07:00.730
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you come down and shoot a giraffe,</v>

1601
01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:02.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1602
01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:03.940
<v Speaker 2>pay 1 million bucks to come down and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot a draft.</v>

1603
01:07:03.970 --> 01:07:05.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer's no,</v>

1604
01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:08.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to kill a giraffe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you called me and said,</v>

1605
01:07:08.561 --> 01:07:09.580
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1606
01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:12.490
<v Speaker 2>we have restored this habitat in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole river delta,</v>

1607
01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:16.240
<v Speaker 2>and Lo and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the giraffes have absolutely taken off</v>

1608
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.150
<v Speaker 2>and they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very successful and they're decimating</v>

1609
01:07:19.151 --> 01:07:21.820
<v Speaker 2>the vegetation here and they're starting</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight each other with,</v>

1610
01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:24.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great severity and were finding dead</v>

1611
01:07:24.701 --> 01:07:27.820
<v Speaker 2>bowls and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to remove 10 animals from this</v>

1612
01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.070
<v Speaker 2>hurdle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You come down and shoot 10 drops with</v>

1613
01:07:30.071 --> 01:07:30.760
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100%.</v>

1614
01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I can come down and contribute</v>

1615
01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:38.970
<v Speaker 2>to the ecology of an area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either as a hunter or as somebody that's</v>

1616
01:07:39.281 --> 01:07:42.970
<v Speaker 2>just removing animals with a high</v>
<v Speaker 2>powered rifle to create some more</v>

1617
01:07:42.971 --> 01:07:44.980
<v Speaker 2>balance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all into it.</v>

1618
01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:50.010
<v Speaker 2>But if I'm going to pay you $70,000 to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a big main line so I can have my</v>

1619
01:07:51.071 --> 01:07:53.960
<v Speaker 2>photo with a big main lion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1620
01:07:54.010 --> 01:07:55.360
<v Speaker 2>that I can show my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

1621
01:07:55.361 --> 01:07:57.790
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when I was in Botswana and that's</v>

1622
01:07:57.791 --> 01:08:01.840
<v Speaker 2>all I could tell you that story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had no interest in it.</v>

1623
01:08:01.841 --> 01:08:06.841
<v Speaker 2>And I think some of that stuff is</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe really poisonous for hunting.</v>

1624
01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:10.120
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very poisonous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that Cecil the lion story,</v>

1625
01:08:10.121 --> 01:08:12.130
<v Speaker 2>it was incredibly poisonous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1626
01:08:12.310 --> 01:08:16.250
<v Speaker 2>It was one of those stories where it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost to</v>

1627
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:21.310
<v Speaker 1>find any support for the guy who did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing and you know,</v>

1628
01:08:21.591 --> 01:08:23.840
<v Speaker 1>and it was legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1629
01:08:23.841 --> 01:08:24.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1630
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:26.470
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the collared lion yet blown?</v>

1631
01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:29.580
<v Speaker 1>You can't really tell like they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant mains.</v>

1632
01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Even if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean anything.</v>

1633
01:08:30.921 --> 01:08:32.780
<v Speaker 1>You can shoot color an animal's yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1634
01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:34.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not collared because they're</v>

1635
01:08:34.281 --> 01:08:36.320
<v Speaker 1>protected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like the idea is like you could</v>

1636
01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:38.180
<v Speaker 1>never shoot it because it's collared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1637
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:39.620
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1638
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:43.480
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not what people [inaudible].</v>

1639
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:46.040
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's real hard to justify if you're not</v>

1640
01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:47.030
<v Speaker 1>eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1641
01:08:47.031 --> 01:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you want to do it?</v>

1642
01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Why would you want to go and hunt a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lion?</v>

1643
01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.670
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to be an asshole.</v>

1644
01:08:52.730 --> 01:08:54.320
<v Speaker 1>That guy not asking himself any</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

1645
01:08:54.321 --> 01:08:55.220
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1646
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:56.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1647
01:08:56.751 --> 01:08:57.580
<v Speaker 1>Why is he doing it?</v>

1648
01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:59.180
<v Speaker 1>He's doing it because that's what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>likes to do.</v>

1649
01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.260
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1650
01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I haven't grizzly bear hunting in</v>
<v Speaker 1>British Columbia,</v>

1651
01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:04.520
<v Speaker 1>but I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not,</v>

1652
01:09:04.521 --> 01:09:06.650
<v Speaker 1>I have lots of friends that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are guides and outfitters.</v>

1653
01:09:06.651 --> 01:09:09.500
<v Speaker 1>And I understand that the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1654
01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:12.110
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it's gross too,</v>

1655
01:09:12.111 --> 01:09:14.480
<v Speaker 1>but I've eaten it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is it fantastic.</v>

1656
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1657
01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:17.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1658
01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.600
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know John Barklow from Sitka?</v>

1659
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1660
01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I think I've met him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've met him just telling me</v>

1661
01:09:24.891 --> 01:09:25.724
<v Speaker 1>that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1662
01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:30.080
<v Speaker 1>he served people a brown bear meat at</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

1663
01:09:30.081 --> 01:09:31.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a party once,</v>

1664
01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:34.910
<v Speaker 1>like kid cooked it and put it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made it like little hors d'oeuvres and</v>

1665
01:09:34.911 --> 01:09:36.350
<v Speaker 1>he didn't tell people what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

1666
01:09:36.351 --> 01:09:37.310
<v Speaker 1>this is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

1667
01:09:37.311 --> 01:09:37.881
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1668
01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:40.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a brown bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they got real mad at him making me</v>

1669
01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.130
<v Speaker 1>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they liked it.</v>

1670
01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1671
01:09:43.730 --> 01:09:45.110
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>

1672
01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:47.750
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was hunting a brown bears on Kodiak</v>

1673
01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:49.520
<v Speaker 2>island a few years ago and I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't kill one.</v>

1674
01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when we got done,</v>

1675
01:09:51.651 --> 01:09:54.680
<v Speaker 2>there was a guy there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a classically trained chef that lived in</v>

1676
01:09:54.681 --> 01:09:56.580
<v Speaker 2>town and he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1677
01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:59.780
<v Speaker 2>him and his buddies had killed a bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he invited us over for dinner and</v>

1678
01:09:59.781 --> 01:10:03.800
<v Speaker 2>when we were in town and he served as</v>
<v Speaker 2>brown bear and it was amazing.</v>

1679
01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:05.750
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you cook it?</v>

1680
01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:08.600
<v Speaker 2>He did it several different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the ways he did it,</v>

1681
01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:09.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was really amazing.</v>

1682
01:10:09.681 --> 01:10:11.210
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is all in preparation,</v>

1683
01:10:11.211 --> 01:10:12.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he made kind of like Swedish</v>

1684
01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:14.360
<v Speaker 2>meatballs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he probably,</v>

1685
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:16.910
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he told us that the preparation was</v>

1686
01:10:16.911 --> 01:10:18.620
<v Speaker 2>intensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he made a bath,</v>

1687
01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:21.740
<v Speaker 2>a whole milk bath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put the bear meat in it,</v>

1688
01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:25.160
<v Speaker 2>let it sit for 10 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dump the milk,</v>

1689
01:10:25.161 --> 01:10:27.890
<v Speaker 2>output more whole milk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did that like four or five times</v>

1690
01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:30.830
<v Speaker 2>to just leech anything that was in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>meat out.</v>

1691
01:10:30.831 --> 01:10:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably blood in any sort of,</v>

1692
01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:34.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know</v>

1693
01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:36.240
<v Speaker 1>if you could be elk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

1694
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:39.990
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno if that's doing that with bass,</v>

1695
01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:43.950
<v Speaker 1>like taking baths filets and catfish</v>
<v Speaker 1>filets and putting them in milk.</v>

1696
01:10:44.010 --> 01:10:44.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1697
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:47.420
<v Speaker 2>And would it be something along the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines of Osmosis?</v>

1698
01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Would it be that the milk has a greater</v>
<v Speaker 2>density?</v>

1699
01:10:50.391 --> 01:10:52.640
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the blood wants to leave the meat and</v>

1700
01:10:52.641 --> 01:10:55.160
<v Speaker 2>go into that and create asking the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

1701
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:57.170
<v Speaker 2>I really have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just me guessing.</v>

1702
01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1703
01:10:58.281 --> 01:11:02.120
<v Speaker 2>and then he pants here to a bunch of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was like a roast,</v>

1704
01:11:02.121 --> 01:11:05.060
<v Speaker 2>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he did it all in a really hot cast</v>

1705
01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:08.840
<v Speaker 2>iron skillet and it was phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I just heard somebody the other</v>

1706
01:11:08.841 --> 01:11:09.890
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1707
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:12.270
<v Speaker 2>what was I listening to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1708
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:14.280
<v Speaker 2>I was reading something about polar bear</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting</v>

1709
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:17.280
<v Speaker 1>and somebody was remarking that a polar</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear was really good to eat.</v>

1710
01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:21.900
<v Speaker 1>And so I think there's a lot of um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>misinformation out there about what is</v>

1711
01:11:21.901 --> 01:11:24.450
<v Speaker 1>edible and what is not edible and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>is good and what isn't.</v>

1712
01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:27.390
<v Speaker 1>And probably because of the preparation</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people think so.</v>

1713
01:11:27.490 --> 01:11:30.150
<v Speaker 1>I've been ignorant about how to prepare</v>
<v Speaker 1>and key up me.</v>

1714
01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause I have people that think I have</v>

1715
01:11:32.041 --> 01:11:33.870
<v Speaker 1>lots of friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think deer meat's disgusting.</v>

1716
01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:36.870
<v Speaker 1>Soak fish and milk for odor free</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking.</v>

1717
01:11:37.330 --> 01:11:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1718
01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:41.760
<v Speaker 1>So it says when you're buying fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1719
01:11:41.761 --> 01:11:44.310
<v Speaker 1>here's the science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try to say that word.</v>

1720
01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Try methylene trimethylamine oxide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trimethylamine oxide oxide is a common</v>

1721
01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:51.570
<v Speaker 1>chemical in living things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's colorless,</v>

1722
01:11:51.571 --> 01:11:54.060
<v Speaker 1>odorless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and produced by normal metabolic</v>

1723
01:11:54.061 --> 01:11:56.670
<v Speaker 1>processes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a fish or shellfish is killed,</v>

1724
01:11:56.671 --> 01:11:58.830
<v Speaker 1>however it breaks down into</v>
<v Speaker 1>trimethylamine,</v>

1725
01:11:59.070 --> 01:12:02.760
<v Speaker 1>which is the chemical responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fishy smell that we know so well.</v>

1726
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:07.830
<v Speaker 1>If your cut of fish isn't too far gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the flesh is still from and only a</v>

1727
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:11.450
<v Speaker 1>few days thought at most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quick soak about 10 to 20 minutes and</v>

1728
01:12:11.451 --> 01:12:14.190
<v Speaker 1>a bowl of milk will help get rid of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>odor like casing.</v>

1729
01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd he say it?</v>

1730
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Is that Cassie or Casey?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it both ways.</v>

1731
01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.200
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only read it.</v>

1732
01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>C A s e I n in the milk bonds with the</v>

1733
01:12:22.741 --> 01:12:26.010
<v Speaker 1>tri methylene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while it's not a full extraction,</v>

1734
01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.510
<v Speaker 1>a quick soak can pull a good bit amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the flesh,</v>

1735
01:12:28.530 --> 01:12:30.880
<v Speaker 1>reduce the odor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's probably what's going on.</v>

1736
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:35.190
<v Speaker 1>You're reducing the odor and the meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it just probably re enhancing the</v>

1737
01:12:35.191 --> 01:12:38.630
<v Speaker 1>flavor and doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with a stinky as Baird's meat</v>

1738
01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:41.610
<v Speaker 1>and fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this one definitely had,</v>

1739
01:12:41.611 --> 01:12:42.421
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1740
01:12:42.421 --> 01:12:45.390
<v Speaker 1>well the big ones especially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one of the reasons why the</v>

1741
01:12:45.391 --> 01:12:48.990
<v Speaker 1>grow so big on Kodiak rights because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have so much access to fish and</v>

1742
01:12:48.991 --> 01:12:49.960
<v Speaker 1>short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1743
01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:51.870
<v Speaker 1>short torpor short hibernation.</v>

1744
01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy,</v>

1745
01:12:53.071 --> 01:12:53.960
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1746
01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never eaten grizzly.</v>

1747
01:12:56.401 --> 01:12:58.860
<v Speaker 1>I've eaten brown bear or black bear</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather.</v>

1748
01:12:58.861 --> 01:12:59.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1749
01:13:00.090 --> 01:13:03.480
<v Speaker 1>my friend John and Jen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a camp up in Alberta and we,</v>

1750
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:04.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh sure eight.</v>

1751
01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you know them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Rivets?</v>

1752
01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:07.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the,</v>

1753
01:13:07.401 --> 01:13:10.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a camp up in Alberta and great</v>

1754
01:13:10.021 --> 01:13:13.770
<v Speaker 1>black pair of hunting and jen is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good cook and she made this black</v>

1755
01:13:13.771 --> 01:13:16.380
<v Speaker 1>bear stir fry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even people that were skeptical,</v>

1756
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:17.330
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1757
01:13:17.331 --> 01:13:18.660
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never eaten bear before.</v>

1758
01:13:18.661 --> 01:13:19.740
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy shit,</v>

1759
01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:23.550
<v Speaker 1>this is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She cooked this stir fry and then serve</v>

1760
01:13:23.551 --> 01:13:24.690
<v Speaker 1>it over rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1761
01:13:24.691 --> 01:13:26.110
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

1762
01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:29.100
<v Speaker 1>It was so good and so good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way I explain it to people,</v>

1763
01:13:29.101 --> 01:13:31.440
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a d like a deer fucked a pig.</v>

1764
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:33.090
<v Speaker 1>That's what the meat tastes like.</v>

1765
01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:38.100
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's cousin was a cow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's,</v>

1766
01:13:38.101 --> 01:13:41.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a meat that tastes like</v>

1767
01:13:41.371 --> 01:13:43.920
<v Speaker 1>anything you could put your thumb on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1768
01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:46.560
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's just like this.</v>

1769
01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

1770
01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:49.650
<v Speaker 1>that's just really rich and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1771
01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fantastic.</v>

1772
01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:52.830
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at bear hunting all the way around,</v>

1773
01:13:52.831 --> 01:13:54.210
<v Speaker 1>it's just awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1774
01:13:54.211 --> 01:13:55.200
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1775
01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:59.580
<v Speaker 1>it's so charged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so charged in the public eye in</v>

1776
01:13:59.581 --> 01:14:03.930
<v Speaker 1>terms of like how people perceive it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those animals.</v>

1777
01:14:03.931 --> 01:14:07.950
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's because of these movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people grow up with these movies</v>

1778
01:14:07.951 --> 01:14:10.260
<v Speaker 1>where these animals are our friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1779
01:14:10.261 --> 01:14:12.130
<v Speaker 1>and they're looking out us and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>our buddies.</v>

1780
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:17.020
<v Speaker 3>And it's just like we've done ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>knows service by doing that,</v>

1781
01:14:17.021 --> 01:14:20.920
<v Speaker 3>by creating these films that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>poisoned little kids' minds as to what</v>

1782
01:14:20.921 --> 01:14:25.921
<v Speaker 3>these animals are and what these animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>are are opportunists and predators.</v>

1783
01:14:25.991 --> 01:14:29.130
<v Speaker 3>And they are there to remove the weak</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

1784
01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:32.860
<v Speaker 3>the limping and the babies and anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>else he can get his hands on for</v>

1785
01:14:32.861 --> 01:14:35.530
<v Speaker 3>population control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is the balance of nature.</v>

1786
01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:38.020
<v Speaker 3>If we still were hunters and gatherers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1787
01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:42.430
<v Speaker 3>there would not be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was not a single anti hunter in</v>

1788
01:14:42.431 --> 01:14:43.420
<v Speaker 3>that group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1789
01:14:43.421 --> 01:14:46.450
<v Speaker 3>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy didn't live,</v>

1790
01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.640
<v Speaker 3>there is no room for that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even,</v>

1791
01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:50.800
<v Speaker 3>you know what I talked about in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>short film,</v>

1792
01:14:50.801 --> 01:14:54.310
<v Speaker 3>who we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the president of Pida comes from a</v>

1793
01:14:54.311 --> 01:14:58.930
<v Speaker 3>strong group of hunters and gatherers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise the dude wouldn't be here like</v>

1794
01:14:58.931 --> 01:15:01.420
<v Speaker 3>to play devil's advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their thought process and the thought</v>

1795
01:15:01.421 --> 01:15:04.960
<v Speaker 3>process of vegans and vegetarians are</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1796
01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:08.650
<v Speaker 3>if I could speak for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we're moving past that we're</v>

1797
01:15:08.651 --> 01:15:10.390
<v Speaker 3>moving past animal cruelty.</v>

1798
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:13.420
<v Speaker 3>We're moving past that need to eat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>consume meat.</v>

1799
01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:15.880
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1800
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.440
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I disagree.</v>

1801
01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:19.110
<v Speaker 3>I think we have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1802
01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:22.420
<v Speaker 3>through infrastructures of Safety and</v>
<v Speaker 3>laziness we've set,</v>

1803
01:15:22.450 --> 01:15:25.420
<v Speaker 3>we've set it up so that you can go down</v>
<v Speaker 3>that road if you want.</v>

1804
01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:28.000
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've shut this up so you don't have to,</v>

1805
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:29.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>break.</v>

1806
01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.910
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never have to crack an egg.</v>

1807
01:15:30.911 --> 01:15:32.950
<v Speaker 3>If you have enough money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never have to crack an egg in your</v>

1808
01:15:32.951 --> 01:15:37.510
<v Speaker 3>entire life and you can eat eggs your</v>
<v Speaker 3>entire life so you can back away from</v>

1809
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.510
<v Speaker 3>who we really are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you know,</v>

1810
01:15:40.511 --> 01:15:44.650
<v Speaker 3>if you have the financial wherewithal or</v>
<v Speaker 3>you live in New York City or you live in</v>

1811
01:15:44.651 --> 01:15:47.080
<v Speaker 3>La,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can back off of the real muddiness</v>

1812
01:15:47.081 --> 01:15:49.420
<v Speaker 3>as far as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in true reality,</v>

1813
01:15:49.421 --> 01:15:53.410
<v Speaker 3>this is really who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that we have infrastructures</v>

1814
01:15:53.411 --> 01:15:55.420
<v Speaker 3>now that make up for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that make you,</v>

1815
01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:58.000
<v Speaker 3>that allow that disconnection.</v>

1816
01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:00.520
<v Speaker 3>They allow you to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>

1817
01:16:00.521 --> 01:16:01.750
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we move past this now.</v>

1818
01:16:01.751 --> 01:16:03.640
<v Speaker 3>Like I can get my coffee at the corner</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1819
01:16:03.641 --> 01:16:04.570
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

1820
01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.880
<v Speaker 3>and it's to go to Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1821
01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to argue,</v>

1822
01:16:08.050 --> 01:16:08.920
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to argue.</v>

1823
01:16:08.921 --> 01:16:10.640
<v Speaker 3>And we did a piece,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1824
01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:12.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my production company,</v>

1825
01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Sick Manta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did a piece of years ago or last year</v>

1826
01:16:14.321 --> 01:16:16.090
<v Speaker 3>for epic meets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1827
01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:19.090
<v Speaker 3>have you ever heard of those guys?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they do like high and Jerky and they</v>

1828
01:16:19.091 --> 01:16:22.120
<v Speaker 3>do like animal fats and they do bone</v>
<v Speaker 3>broths and things like that.</v>

1829
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:24.940
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the owners were bars.</v>

1830
01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:26.500
<v Speaker 3>Those are delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1831
01:16:26.501 --> 01:16:28.960
<v Speaker 3>they're really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the owners were vegans,</v>

1832
01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:31.720
<v Speaker 3>they are both vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a husband and wife couple and,</v>

1833
01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:34.660
<v Speaker 3>and they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're both also triathletes.</v>

1834
01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:40.200
<v Speaker 3>And they were doing these races and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were having a tough time recovering from</v>

1835
01:16:40.241 --> 01:16:43.930
<v Speaker 3>their races and they actually owned one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the largest vegan food companies in</v>

1836
01:16:43.931 --> 01:16:47.050
<v Speaker 3>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they went to go see a friend who was</v>

1837
01:16:47.051 --> 01:16:49.450
<v Speaker 3>a medical doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend of theirs.</v>

1838
01:16:49.451 --> 01:16:50.530
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey look,</v>

1839
01:16:50.531 --> 01:16:53.260
<v Speaker 3>I think you guys need to get some</v>
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

1840
01:16:53.290 --> 01:16:54.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>high end,</v>

1841
01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:56.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal fats in your systems to help your</v>

1842
01:16:56.951 --> 01:17:00.640
<v Speaker 3>body recover from these races.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they started doing that and their</v>

1843
01:17:00.641 --> 01:17:01.600
<v Speaker 3>symptoms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1844
01:17:01.601 --> 01:17:03.670
<v Speaker 3>like their soreness or whether it be</v>
<v Speaker 3>back pain,</v>

1845
01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:05.050
<v Speaker 3>hip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knees,</v>

1846
01:17:05.051 --> 01:17:06.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm assuming that was all from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>races,</v>

1847
01:17:07.150 --> 01:17:08.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started to go away almost.</v>

1848
01:17:09.650 --> 01:17:10.280
<v Speaker 3>So they started</v>

1849
01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:15.280
<v Speaker 2>kind of delving into their psyche and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their questions and they started kind of</v>

1850
01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:18.830
<v Speaker 2>revisiting their philosophies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will.</v>

1851
01:17:18.831 --> 01:17:20.220
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

1852
01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:22.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get the story wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think while they still owned the</v>

1853
01:17:22.851 --> 01:17:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Vegan food company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started epic meets and they</v>

1854
01:17:25.941 --> 01:17:28.460
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we find meat that is responsibly</v>

1855
01:17:28.461 --> 01:17:31.700
<v Speaker 2>grown and sourced for people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to kill it themselves?</v>

1856
01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:32.961
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1857
01:17:32.961 --> 01:17:36.050
<v Speaker 2>and they went down that road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They ended up actually selling the Vegan</v>

1858
01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:37.430
<v Speaker 2>food company off because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1859
01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:41.960
<v Speaker 2>people found out that they owned both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think there is obviously some</v>

1860
01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:44.230
<v Speaker 2>problems there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1861
01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.790
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they just found,</v>

1862
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:48.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good source for me and,</v>

1863
01:17:48.691 --> 01:17:50.510
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do all feel the harvest.</v>

1864
01:17:50.511 --> 01:17:52.790
<v Speaker 2>And so we did a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we did a commercial production for them,</v>

1865
01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:54.460
<v Speaker 2>a branding piece for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1866
01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:57.010
<v Speaker 2>to kind of highlight how they treat</v>
<v Speaker 2>their animals and how they kill their</v>

1867
01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:58.160
<v Speaker 2>animals because they kill them.</v>

1868
01:17:58.550 --> 01:18:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than putting them on a truck and</v>

1869
01:18:01.011 --> 01:18:03.170
<v Speaker 2>loading them into crowds and doing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole thing,</v>

1870
01:18:03.171 --> 01:18:06.710
<v Speaker 2>they literally drive out with the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>tractor that they feed them with and</v>

1871
01:18:06.711 --> 01:18:08.990
<v Speaker 2>they've had them on huge pastures so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're actually,</v>

1872
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:11.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm reclaiming the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1873
01:18:11.210 --> 01:18:13.490
<v Speaker 2>and it's really cool when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they do ranches,</v>

1874
01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:17.360
<v Speaker 2>they'll go in and test all the soils of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ranches and the grasses and then</v>

1875
01:18:17.361 --> 01:18:19.970
<v Speaker 2>they'll retest them after one year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three years,</v>

1876
01:18:19.971 --> 01:18:21.980
<v Speaker 2>five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're finding even better soils</v>

1877
01:18:21.981 --> 01:18:24.350
<v Speaker 2>and better grasp as these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've spent time there because they're</v>

1878
01:18:24.351 --> 01:18:25.410
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1879
01:18:25.450 --> 01:18:28.340
<v Speaker 2>more fertilizing and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the grasses are being reclaimed.</v>

1880
01:18:28.341 --> 01:18:29.190
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1881
01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:31.280
<v Speaker 2>they shoot the animal in the head with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>high powered rifle.</v>

1882
01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.650
<v Speaker 2>And so they do just lights out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

1883
01:18:33.651 --> 01:18:35.420
<v Speaker 2>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that's how they booked from so,</v>

1884
01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:36.950
<v Speaker 2>so they do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it</v>

1885
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:39.680
<v Speaker 1>about as ethically and humanely as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can kill an animal,</v>

1886
01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.800
<v Speaker 1>as you can kill an animal that's being</v>
<v Speaker 1>raised in a pen.</v>

1887
01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:46.180
<v Speaker 1>What was that place in la?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it called harmony cafes?</v>

1888
01:18:46.190 --> 01:18:48.860
<v Speaker 1>That what it was called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the place where the people,</v>

1889
01:18:48.861 --> 01:18:51.860
<v Speaker 1>the owned it gratitude cafe gratitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1890
01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:53.150
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

1891
01:18:53.151 --> 01:18:55.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place in la that was owned by these</v>

1892
01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:56.930
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It still is,</v>

1893
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.590
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1894
01:18:57.590 --> 01:19:02.120
<v Speaker 1>they were vegans for a long time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were having health issues as well.</v>

1895
01:19:02.121 --> 01:19:05.060
<v Speaker 1>And they decided to butcher their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and start raising their own</v>

1896
01:19:05.061 --> 01:19:06.890
<v Speaker 1>animals and butchering them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1897
01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:10.910
<v Speaker 1>I think they wrote about it on a blog</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were just trying to explain</v>

1898
01:19:10.911 --> 01:19:13.160
<v Speaker 1>themselves and vegans went fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

1899
01:19:13.161 --> 01:19:15.500
<v Speaker 1>The people that own the restaurant went</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy and they've got a bunch of death</v>

1900
01:19:15.501 --> 01:19:18.410
<v Speaker 1>threats and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it became this giant issue with</v>

1901
01:19:18.411 --> 01:19:19.150
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1902
01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1903
01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:22.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get where they're coming from.</v>

1904
01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:23.401
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1905
01:19:23.401 --> 01:19:27.380
<v Speaker 1>they have this rigid idea of what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and they don't want an animal</v>

1906
01:19:27.381 --> 01:19:29.180
<v Speaker 1>to die so that they can live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

1907
01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:34.630
<v Speaker 1>But their perception of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ethical purity of their deciding to</v>

1908
01:19:35.811 --> 01:19:40.811
<v Speaker 1>just eat vegetables and the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual health consequences in terms</v>

1909
01:19:40.851 --> 01:19:43.970
<v Speaker 1>of like how many people can get by and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your,</v>

1910
01:19:43.971 --> 01:19:47.330
<v Speaker 1>your physical dietary needs are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people can get by on just</v>

1911
01:19:47.331 --> 01:19:50.480
<v Speaker 1>eating a Vegan Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're not like super</v>

1912
01:19:50.481 --> 01:19:54.470
<v Speaker 1>careful and using algae and all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things to get b12 and fat</v>

1913
01:19:54.471 --> 01:19:58.070
<v Speaker 1>soluble vitamins and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get by.</v>

1914
01:19:58.250 --> 01:20:02.570
<v Speaker 1>But is it optimum for most people</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to most nutritionists and</v>

1915
01:20:02.571 --> 01:20:04.280
<v Speaker 1>people that aren't ideologues?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1916
01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1917
01:20:05.941 --> 01:20:06.361
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1918
01:20:06.361 --> 01:20:11.220
<v Speaker 1>it's like we are herbivores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean rather a omnivores and we're not</v>

1919
01:20:11.221 --> 01:20:14.460
<v Speaker 1>herbivores and some people that are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vegetarian world,</v>

1920
01:20:14.461 --> 01:20:18.930
<v Speaker 1>they want us to think that we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically herbivores and that we can get</v>

1921
01:20:18.931 --> 01:20:23.250
<v Speaker 1>by and then our desire to consume meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just because of the sickness that we</v>

1922
01:20:23.251 --> 01:20:26.750
<v Speaker 1>have and this is evil nature that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1923
01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.640
<v Speaker 1>human being sometimes are possessed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1924
01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:30.090
<v Speaker 1>but it's just just not true.</v>

1925
01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are the whole reason why we became</v>

1926
01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:35.820
<v Speaker 1>a human being in the first place as</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to like one of the lower</v>

1927
01:20:35.821 --> 01:20:38.610
<v Speaker 1>primates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that is attributed to our</v>

1928
01:20:38.611 --> 01:20:40.590
<v Speaker 1>consumption of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting,</v>

1929
01:20:40.591 --> 01:20:41.790
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking,</v>

1930
01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:44.670
<v Speaker 1>cooking with fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's such a fantastic,</v>

1931
01:20:44.671 --> 01:20:48.150
<v Speaker 1>like I would love</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could do,</v>

1932
01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:50.160
<v Speaker 1>if I was a billionaire and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1933
01:20:50.161 --> 01:20:53.070
<v Speaker 1>do you want to continue along with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>career that you're on right now?</v>

1934
01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:56.790
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that I would love the most</v>

1935
01:20:56.791 --> 01:20:58.810
<v Speaker 1>is to take people with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1936
01:20:58.811 --> 01:21:02.070
<v Speaker 1>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super hard for a Vegan to get into</v>

1937
01:21:02.071 --> 01:21:03.180
<v Speaker 1>that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1938
01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:04.290
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have to,</v>

1939
01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:07.020
<v Speaker 1>they'd have to have some sort of desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their part.</v>

1940
01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely love life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] you could just like take</v>

1941
01:21:10.441 --> 01:21:14.430
<v Speaker 1>some flower child and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only in sprouts and say,</v>

1942
01:21:14.431 --> 01:21:16.530
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go shoot this mule deer</v>

1943
01:21:16.531 --> 01:21:18.870
<v Speaker 1>through the lungs with a fucking yeah.</v>

1944
01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:19.980
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1945
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Mazy trocar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1946
01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.820
<v Speaker 1>you're going to sit there and watch him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1947
01:21:24.330 --> 01:21:25.470
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have to be,</v>

1948
01:21:26.190 --> 01:21:27.530
<v Speaker 1>have questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1949
01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would have to be on that path</v>

1950
01:21:29.731 --> 01:21:31.200
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

1951
01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:36.260
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting byproduct to me of</v>
<v Speaker 1>society of what we've done with this</v>

1952
01:21:37.081 --> 01:21:40.740
<v Speaker 1>really incredible infrastructure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've created where we can get food to</v>

1953
01:21:40.741 --> 01:21:45.741
<v Speaker 1>these 20 million people that live in La</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no one be a part of that preparation</v>

1954
01:21:46.321 --> 01:21:47.160
<v Speaker 1>in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1955
01:21:47.190 --> 01:21:48.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the animal,</v>

1956
01:21:48.241 --> 01:21:49.560
<v Speaker 1>killing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serving it,</v>

1957
01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:50.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>butchering it,</v>

1958
01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.110
<v Speaker 1>cooking it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serving it.</v>

1959
01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.350
<v Speaker 1>We cut all that shit out and go right to</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying the meat that's already cooked.</v>

1960
01:21:55.351 --> 01:21:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've done it so much and it's so</v>

1961
01:21:58.710 --> 01:22:01.410
<v Speaker 1>much more prevalent than any of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other steps.</v>

1962
01:22:01.890 --> 01:22:02.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the,</v>

1963
01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:07.530
<v Speaker 1>most of the consumption that most people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country,</v>

1964
01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:09.750
<v Speaker 1>like when we're talking about eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>meat,</v>

1965
01:22:10.380 --> 01:22:14.370
<v Speaker 1>I would say maybe even what is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>number?</v>

1966
01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:18.450
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know what the number is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had a guess of how many people even</v>

1967
01:22:18.451 --> 01:22:20.210
<v Speaker 1>cook their own meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

1968
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people are getting most of</v>

1969
01:22:22.861 --> 01:22:27.720
<v Speaker 1>their meals from a store or a restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 1>or fast food?</v>

1970
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty prepped.</v>

1971
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how many people would,</v>

1972
01:22:29.791 --> 01:22:31.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean I didn't even think about fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

1973
01:22:31.171 --> 01:22:32.490
<v Speaker 1>That's gotta be the majority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1974
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:34.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many people actually even cooking</v>

1975
01:22:34.651 --> 01:22:37.380
<v Speaker 1>their own meal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've cut out so many steps.</v>

1976
01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:41.670
<v Speaker 1>When I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would bet it was probably more than</v>

1977
01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:43.440
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't even cook their own meat.</v>

1978
01:22:44.610 --> 01:22:45.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1979
01:22:45.091 --> 01:22:46.680
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't have,</v>

1980
01:22:46.710 --> 01:22:48.810
<v Speaker 1>they just don't have an understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it comes from.</v>

1981
01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And engagement.</v>

1982
01:22:50.761 --> 01:22:53.100
<v Speaker 1>There's just no understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

1983
01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:55.560
<v Speaker 1>It's hard subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just saw,</v>

1984
01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:57.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying here to meet with you.</v>

1985
01:22:57.631 --> 01:23:00.210
<v Speaker 1>I just saw a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in the Minneapolis</v>

1986
01:23:00.211 --> 01:23:02.340
<v Speaker 1>airport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a huge sign on the wall.</v>

1987
01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:07.410
<v Speaker 1>It was a picture of a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive cornfield and it may,</v>

1988
01:23:07.411 --> 01:23:09.670
<v Speaker 1>it may have been doctored up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was corn as far as the eye can</v>

1989
01:23:09.671 --> 01:23:11.710
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was for cargill,</v>

1990
01:23:11.730 --> 01:23:14.830
<v Speaker 1>a big car corporation out of Minneapolis</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then get out of Minneapolis.</v>

1991
01:23:14.831 --> 01:23:15.850
<v Speaker 1>But it said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1992
01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:18.760
<v Speaker 1>it said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1993
01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:23.730
<v Speaker 1>preparing to feed 8 billion people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1994
01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:25.570
<v Speaker 1>so I just see that sign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

1995
01:23:25.630 --> 01:23:28.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hell in a hand basket right there.</v>

1996
01:23:28.410 --> 01:23:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Corns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking terrible for you.</v>

1997
01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely terrible.</v>

1998
01:23:31.331 --> 01:23:31.801
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1999
01:23:31.801 --> 01:23:34.120
<v Speaker 1>and literally you can read that sign and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these people be like,</v>

2000
01:23:34.150 --> 01:23:35.290
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so beautiful.</v>

2001
01:23:35.291 --> 01:23:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Like all those corn stalks and there'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>be food for us forever.</v>

2002
01:23:38.231 --> 01:23:43.210
<v Speaker 1>And why cook when you cannot the</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of diners or dinners rather</v>

2003
01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:47.680
<v Speaker 1>eaten at home that were actually made at</v>
<v Speaker 1>home in the u s and it's so weird having</v>

2004
01:23:47.681 --> 01:23:49.240
<v Speaker 1>you here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie's the shit.</v>

2005
01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:51.080
<v Speaker 1>This is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just dinner.</v>

2006
01:23:51.081 --> 01:23:51.850
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2007
01:23:51.850 --> 01:23:54.910
<v Speaker 1>so this is how many people are cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really that's the only meal.</v>

2008
01:23:55.210 --> 01:23:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Lower and lower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's below,</v>

2009
01:23:57.910 --> 01:24:02.910
<v Speaker 1>it's somewhere in the 60% range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the percentage of it dinners eaten at</v>

2010
01:24:04.121 --> 01:24:09.121
<v Speaker 1>home that were actually made at home in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the u s somewhere around 60% so in that</v>

2011
01:24:10.151 --> 01:24:15.151
<v Speaker 1>60% you got to think there's the mom or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dad that's cooking and then the kids</v>

2012
01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:19.600
<v Speaker 1>that are eating the food so they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking shit.</v>

2013
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:24.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's probably way lower than that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the actual human beings that</v>

2014
01:24:24.251 --> 01:24:26.290
<v Speaker 1>are eating cooked food that they cook</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

2015
01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how can you,</v>

2016
01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:31.050
<v Speaker 1>how can it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you stand on a,</v>

2017
01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:34.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on any sort of laurels at all without at</v>

2018
01:24:34.421 --> 01:24:36.550
<v Speaker 1>least asking some questions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2019
01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:38.740
<v Speaker 1>people that they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their answers are,</v>

2020
01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:42.340
<v Speaker 1>they feel better if they think that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing no harm.</v>

2021
01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:45.700
<v Speaker 1>And the way to do no harm is to eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegan.</v>

2022
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:49.210
<v Speaker 1>So this is the ideology behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I understand it.</v>

2023
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:51.610
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

2024
01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:56.680
<v Speaker 1>But the fucking anger at people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't follow that path is where it gets</v>

2025
01:24:56.681 --> 01:24:58.270
<v Speaker 1>real squirrely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2026
01:24:58.271 --> 01:25:02.050
<v Speaker 1>and it's a small number of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've talked about this in my act,</v>

2027
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:05.860
<v Speaker 1>that the problem with vegans is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with people,</v>

2028
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:08.080
<v Speaker 1>it's not veganism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's people.</v>

2029
01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:10.840
<v Speaker 1>If you get a room that has a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in it,</v>

2030
01:25:11.170 --> 01:25:16.170
<v Speaker 1>the odds of one of those people being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking idiot is 100% it's almost a</v>

2031
01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:18.430
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent that one of them is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking idiot.</v>

2032
01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you get 300 million people,</v>

2033
01:25:21.191 --> 01:25:25.150
<v Speaker 1>you have 3 million fucking idiots and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those folks are vegans.</v>

2034
01:25:25.410 --> 01:25:27.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem with veganism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

2035
01:25:27.730 --> 01:25:31.930
<v Speaker 1>it's not veganism itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's there's a certain percentage of</v>

2036
01:25:31.931 --> 01:25:36.430
<v Speaker 1>human beings that they don't have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to become vegans.</v>

2037
01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just joined this group.</v>

2038
01:25:38.171 --> 01:25:39.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we're,</v>

2039
01:25:39.821 --> 01:25:42.880
<v Speaker 1>we're thinking about louring you in to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Vegan culture,</v>

2040
01:25:42.881 --> 01:25:44.380
<v Speaker 1>but we want to know what your philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2041
01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Are you a hateful person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you a person who's looking to be a</v>

2042
01:25:47.291 --> 01:25:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Vegan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could just talk shit about other</v>

2043
01:25:48.821 --> 01:25:50.610
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you looking to be angry?</v>

2044
01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:54.580
<v Speaker 1>You're looking to be in a group or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gang of plant based gang and put the</v>

2045
01:25:54.581 --> 01:25:57.520
<v Speaker 1>word Vegan in front of your name and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just start talking shit.</v>

2046
01:25:57.521 --> 01:25:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's a lot of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2047
01:25:59.350 --> 01:26:03.560
<v Speaker 1>And so people read all these angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hateful things that people,</v>

2048
01:26:03.561 --> 01:26:04.261
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>

2049
01:26:04.261 --> 01:26:06.110
<v Speaker 1>oh well this is vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not,</v>

2050
01:26:06.330 --> 01:26:08.300
<v Speaker 1>it's not the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the kids are not like that at</v>

2051
01:26:08.301 --> 01:26:09.020
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2052
01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:11.120
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people are not like that at all.</v>

2053
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:15.050
<v Speaker 1>But there's a certain percentage of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they claim veganism and they usually</v>

2054
01:26:15.051 --> 01:26:17.870
<v Speaker 1>put that name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word Vegan in their fucking screen</v>

2055
01:26:17.871 --> 01:26:18.260
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>

2056
01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:20.220
<v Speaker 1>That's how you can spot those assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2057
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Proud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2058
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:23.650
<v Speaker 1>they're into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're in a plant based gang.</v>

2059
01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really what happens.</v>

2060
01:26:24.851 --> 01:26:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what it is is not necessarily</v>

2061
01:26:28.581 --> 01:26:32.990
<v Speaker 1>even a problem of diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem of human nature is that</v>

2062
01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:35.870
<v Speaker 1>people love to stand on the moral high</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

2063
01:26:35.871 --> 01:26:38.000
<v Speaker 1>They will love to point down to all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

2064
01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:41.540
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a religious issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're not eating Halau or you're</v>

2065
01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:44.810
<v Speaker 1>not eating kosher or are you a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating meat on Good Friday.</v>

2066
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Whenever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just decide that they have this</v>

2067
01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:51.470
<v Speaker 1>moral high ground that you don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fuck you.</v>

2068
01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:53.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it really comes from our own</v>

2069
01:26:53.751 --> 01:26:58.640
<v Speaker 1>questions of our own existence and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>messiness that we're all inherently</v>

2070
01:26:58.641 --> 01:27:01.490
<v Speaker 1>aware of that life eats life</v>

2071
01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:03.810
<v Speaker 2>big time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big Time.</v>

2072
01:27:03.850 --> 01:27:07.680
<v Speaker 2>There was a guy that I did a podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>without a Maine and he was,</v>

2073
01:27:07.681 --> 01:27:11.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was for sure a vegetarian.</v>

2074
01:27:11.461 --> 01:27:15.510
<v Speaker 2>He might've been a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he started and he's a forge or</v>

2075
01:27:15.511 --> 01:27:17.460
<v Speaker 2>big time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually pretty remarkable what he</v>

2076
01:27:17.461 --> 01:27:20.670
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think 99% of his food he finds in</v>

2077
01:27:20.671 --> 01:27:22.950
<v Speaker 2>the forest year round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just into it.</v>

2078
01:27:22.951 --> 01:27:27.951
<v Speaker 2>Big Time process all of his food from</v>
<v Speaker 2>wild apples to acorns to tovar.</v>

2079
01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:29.161
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2080
01:27:29.161 --> 01:27:30.580
<v Speaker 2>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2081
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:33.530
<v Speaker 2>what's Daniel vitality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2082
01:27:34.050 --> 01:27:34.501
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2083
01:27:34.501 --> 01:27:35.550
<v Speaker 2>Daniel vitale's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2084
01:27:35.551 --> 01:27:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard of him as well?</v>

2085
01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2086
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:39.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I did a podcast with him and he,</v>

2087
01:27:39.391 --> 01:27:41.160
<v Speaker 2>and he told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2088
01:27:41.670 --> 01:27:43.740
<v Speaker 2>and he'd eat insects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want it.</v>

2089
01:27:43.741 --> 01:27:46.330
<v Speaker 2>He has completely against hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to kill anything.</v>

2090
01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:47.730
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why he's eating insects.</v>

2091
01:27:47.731 --> 01:27:48.990
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I would get a little bit of hate</v>

2092
01:27:48.991 --> 01:27:49.824
<v Speaker 2>mail.</v>

2093
01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:52.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started eating a Damsel,</v>

2094
01:27:52.231 --> 01:27:54.630
<v Speaker 2>flies and dragonflies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'd get a little bit of hate mail.</v>

2095
01:27:54.631 --> 01:27:56.400
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a friend of his was like,</v>

2096
01:27:56.401 --> 01:27:57.280
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2097
01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:58.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should,</v>

2098
01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:01.260
<v Speaker 2>let's go gig some frogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go get some frogs,</v>

2099
01:28:01.261 --> 01:28:01.891
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2100
01:28:01.891 --> 01:28:02.550
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

2101
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll do it.</v>

2102
01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:05.340
<v Speaker 2>So when he started catching frogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2103
01:28:05.341 --> 01:28:07.890
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a lot of meat on one of</v>

2104
01:28:07.891 --> 01:28:08.790
<v Speaker 2>these frogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's,</v>

2105
01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:09.450
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2106
01:28:09.450 --> 01:28:11.790
<v Speaker 2>it's like 20 dragonflies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2107
01:28:11.791 --> 01:28:12.870
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he got,</v>

2108
01:28:12.871 --> 01:28:16.530
<v Speaker 2>he got a little bit more flack for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it's a buddy of his wanting to</v>

2109
01:28:16.531 --> 01:28:19.410
<v Speaker 2>take him fishing and they caught a trout</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>

2110
01:28:19.411 --> 01:28:21.030
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like three frogs.</v>

2111
01:28:21.090 --> 01:28:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Like this is three frog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what he's equating it to is how</v>

2112
01:28:24.151 --> 01:28:28.290
<v Speaker 2>much work he has to go through to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>this protein or to get this,</v>

2113
01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:29.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get just plant,</v>

2114
01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:31.650
<v Speaker 2>like you find one apple that's 15</v>
<v Speaker 2>acorns,</v>

2115
01:28:31.651 --> 01:28:31.950
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2116
01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:36.540
<v Speaker 2>And so like he's equating this to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he kept just kept moving up the</v>

2117
01:28:36.541 --> 01:28:37.920
<v Speaker 2>food chain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2118
01:28:37.921 --> 01:28:40.430
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then one year he killed a Turkey and</v>

2119
01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.630
<v Speaker 2>he told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I killed a snowshoe hare.</v>

2120
01:28:42.631 --> 01:28:46.590
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was blown away at how much meat was on</v>

2121
01:28:46.591 --> 01:28:47.550
<v Speaker 2>a snowshoe hare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2122
01:28:47.551 --> 01:28:48.890
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2123
01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:51.300
<v Speaker 2>three meals for him and his girlfriend</v>
<v Speaker 2>try a moose.</v>

2124
01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:53.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he just kept moving up and killed</v>

2125
01:28:53.341 --> 01:28:55.200
<v Speaker 2>a Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then this last year he killed a black</v>

2126
01:28:55.201 --> 01:28:57.600
<v Speaker 2>bear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's like every stage that he's</v>

2127
01:28:57.601 --> 01:29:00.000
<v Speaker 2>moved up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his hate mail is went up,</v>

2128
01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no horn exponentially,</v>

2129
01:29:01.771 --> 01:29:02.070
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2130
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.750
<v Speaker 3>significantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's just,</v>

2131
01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:05.790
<v Speaker 3>people equate all of these things to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2132
01:29:05.791 --> 01:29:07.380
<v Speaker 3>they remember,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we relate more to mammals,</v>

2133
01:29:07.381 --> 01:29:08.430
<v Speaker 3>obviously we're mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2134
01:29:08.431 --> 01:29:12.510
<v Speaker 3>and then you bring in something like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bear that has anthropomorphic,</v>

2135
01:29:12.650 --> 01:29:14.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mannerisms,</v>

2136
01:29:14.101 --> 01:29:14.541
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

2137
01:29:14.541 --> 01:29:16.830
<v Speaker 3>you watch a black bear for a half a day</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

2138
01:29:16.831 --> 01:29:18.080
<v Speaker 3>you see your dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2139
01:29:18.081 --> 01:29:20.370
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just sat on his ass for four hours</v>

2140
01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:23.340
<v Speaker 3>around sometimes on his toenails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2141
01:29:23.341 --> 01:29:27.180
<v Speaker 3>He's like itched his ear farted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he pooped over there next to the girl</v>

2142
01:29:27.181 --> 01:29:27.961
<v Speaker 3>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

2143
01:29:27.961 --> 01:29:30.270
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's my dad hunting my dad.</v>

2144
01:29:30.271 --> 01:29:31.104
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2145
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:32.160
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2146
01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:34.080
<v Speaker 3>there's things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

2147
01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:36.960
<v Speaker 3>that's where this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's where this really cool</v>

2148
01:29:36.961 --> 01:29:38.790
<v Speaker 3>engagement comes from with hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2149
01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:41.460
<v Speaker 3>and there's a lot of hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I talked to a lot of hundreds and I</v>

2150
01:29:41.461 --> 01:29:43.110
<v Speaker 3>don't want to be negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying not to be negative,</v>

2151
01:29:43.111 --> 01:29:44.350
<v Speaker 3>but I talked to a lot of hundreds that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have no,</v>

2152
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:45.810
<v Speaker 3>I have nothing in common with them.</v>

2153
01:29:45.930 --> 01:29:47.760
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you hunt,</v>

2154
01:29:47.761 --> 01:29:49.680
<v Speaker 3>I hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think we have that uncommon</v>

2155
01:29:49.681 --> 01:29:52.010
<v Speaker 3>because I see how you hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this had nothing to do with how I</v>

2156
01:29:52.011 --> 01:29:54.120
<v Speaker 3>sound like what we were just saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>about vegans,</v>

2157
01:29:54.121 --> 01:29:56.040
<v Speaker 3>that the problem is just being a human</v>
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

2158
01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:59.700
<v Speaker 3>That's the amount of people that choose</v>
<v Speaker 3>to hunt that or they're not well</v>

2159
01:29:59.701 --> 01:30:01.350
<v Speaker 3>informed and they're fucking idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2160
01:30:01.410 --> 01:30:02.970
<v Speaker 3>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the stuff is like,</v>

2161
01:30:02.971 --> 01:30:04.470
<v Speaker 3>same with the vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2162
01:30:04.471 --> 01:30:06.720
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's vegans that sit at home</v>

2163
01:30:06.721 --> 01:30:10.080
<v Speaker 3>and just grab their face and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe somebody just said that.</v>

2164
01:30:10.081 --> 01:30:11.760
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe they sent a death</v>
<v Speaker 3>threat.</v>

2165
01:30:12.270 --> 01:30:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're Vegan for God's,</v>

2166
01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:18.300

<v Speaker 3>net words hilarious comedian.</v>

2167
01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:19.800

<v Speaker 3>I know some vegans too.</v>

2168
01:30:19.801 --> 01:30:21.630
<v Speaker 3>And I actually know some vegetarians</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2169

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2170
01:30:22.651 --> 01:30:25.320
<v Speaker 3>it was an education for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had some vegetarians hit me up for</v>

2171

<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>this was a while ago,</v>

2180
01:30:36.481 --> 01:30:37.111
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2181
01:30:37.111 --> 01:30:40.410
<v Speaker 3>now I'm starting to get it here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people have ethical concerns about</v>

2182
01:30:40.411 --> 01:30:42.020
<v Speaker 3>where their meat comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2183
01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:45.150
<v Speaker 3>My friend Jake shields,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a go fight in the UFC and he's a</v>

2184
01:30:45.570 --> 01:30:48.450
<v Speaker 3>worldclass Jujitsu black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's been a vegetarian his whole life.</v>

2185
01:30:48.451 --> 01:30:50.220
<v Speaker 3>But he said he would eat meat that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunted.</v>

2186
01:30:50.370 --> 01:30:51.031
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

2187
01:30:51.031 --> 01:30:52.020
<v Speaker 3>cause that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2188
01:30:52.170 --> 01:30:54.510
<v Speaker 3>there's no ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it adds up in his head for him.</v>

2189
01:30:54.511 --> 01:30:56.220
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the answers his questions and</v>

2190
01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:58.170
<v Speaker 3>sonically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's exactly it.</v>

2191
01:30:59.340 --> 01:31:01.440
<v Speaker 3>I've had some awesome conversations</v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

2192
01:31:01.530 --> 01:31:04.320
<v Speaker 3>with people that were not hunters that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2193
01:31:04.410 --> 01:31:06.030
<v Speaker 3>asked great questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2194
01:31:06.031 --> 01:31:09.000
<v Speaker 3>way better than conversations I've had</v>
<v Speaker 3>with guys that call themselves hunters</v>

2195
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.720
<v Speaker 3>at times.</v>

2196
01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:10.291
<v Speaker 3>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2197
01:31:10.291 --> 01:31:12.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean this again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the problem with human beings,</v>

2198
01:31:12.781 --> 01:31:13.381
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2199
01:31:13.381 --> 01:31:14.850
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's certain people that just aren't</v>

2200
01:31:14.851 --> 01:31:16.800
<v Speaker 3>thinking that much and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's certain,</v>

2201
01:31:16.830 --> 01:31:20.180
<v Speaker 3>there's certain parts of the hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture that are really a boring.</v>

2202
01:31:20.210 --> 01:31:20.740
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2203
01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:21.421
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2204
01:31:21.421 --> 01:31:26.421
<v Speaker 3>there's people that think it's funny or</v>
<v Speaker 3>fun to shoot as many animals as they can</v>

2205
01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:30.210
<v Speaker 3>and they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have any consideration to,</v>

2206
01:31:30.230 --> 01:31:33.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this life has been taken so that</v>

2207
01:31:33.361 --> 01:31:38.190
<v Speaker 3>your life can be nurtured or get</v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrition from this animal.</v>

2208
01:31:38.191 --> 01:31:40.770
<v Speaker 3>And they're not thinking of it in terms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this cycle of life.</v>

2209
01:31:41.190 --> 01:31:43.560
<v Speaker 3>They're just thinking of in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2210
01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:46.860
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like the worst aspects that you get</v>

2211
01:31:46.890 --> 01:31:51.890
<v Speaker 3>like in a movie about hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for me like doing it,</v>

2212
01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:53.830
<v Speaker 3>going to the Arctic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2213
01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:55.920
<v Speaker 3>I bring that up often because it's my</v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite place.</v>

2214
01:31:55.921 --> 01:31:58.590
<v Speaker 3>But once you realize the Arctic your</v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite place,</v>

2215
01:31:58.620 --> 01:31:59.860
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2216
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:03.250
<v Speaker 2>just so wide open and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2217
01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:04.420
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2218
01:32:04.690 --> 01:32:09.070
<v Speaker 2>northern lights at night if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're locking massive moose and</v>

2219
01:32:09.071 --> 01:32:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Caribou,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like watching Caribou migrate and</v>

2220
01:32:11.051 --> 01:32:12.910
<v Speaker 2>Grizzly bears eating blueberries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

2221
01:32:12.911 --> 01:32:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent so much time with wolves up in</v>

2222
01:32:15.701 --> 01:32:16.680
<v Speaker 2>these areas and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2223
01:32:16.681 --> 01:32:18.880
<v Speaker 2>and really engaging with the wolves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and just,</v>

2224
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:21.910
<v Speaker 2>it's just always fed these experiences</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

2225
01:32:21.911 --> 01:32:25.270
<v Speaker 2>And that's what really started to mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what really mattered the most to</v>

2226
01:32:25.271 --> 01:32:29.080
<v Speaker 2>me was being in these areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a deep breath,</v>

2227
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:32.680
<v Speaker 2>being super present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being super aware and seeing all of</v>

2228
01:32:32.681 --> 01:32:36.040
<v Speaker 2>these different things that were filling</v>
<v Speaker 2>my soul.</v>

2229
01:32:36.041 --> 01:32:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>True soul food wall.</v>

2230
01:32:37.691 --> 01:32:41.950
<v Speaker 2>I was hunting and Moose are wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was hunting and Caribou and then maybe</v>

2231
01:32:41.951 --> 01:32:45.490
<v Speaker 2>being successful on a moose or Caribou</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and skinning it out and,</v>

2232
01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:47.840
<v Speaker 2>and feeling the weight on my back.</v>

2233
01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:50.680
<v Speaker 2>So I'm getting it back to camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the northern lights or overhead or</v>

2234
01:32:50.681 --> 01:32:51.610
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're not out,</v>

2235
01:32:51.611 --> 01:32:54.160
<v Speaker 2>the stars are out and I'm hearing wolves</v>
<v Speaker 2>howling.</v>

2236
01:32:54.161 --> 01:32:55.300
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2237
01:32:55.301 --> 01:32:56.134
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2238
01:32:56.290 --> 01:32:57.123
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2239
01:32:57.340 --> 01:33:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I lived with a pack of wolves one summer</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Alaska when I was up there doing</v>

2240
01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:03.130
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so like all of these with a pack of</v>

2241
01:33:03.131 --> 01:33:04.810
<v Speaker 2>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I just do that.</v>

2242
01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2243
01:33:06.851 --> 01:33:09.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing research for the US fish and</v>

2244
01:33:09.311 --> 01:33:13.930
<v Speaker 2>wildlife service and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran a research campa genetics camp for</v>

2245
01:33:13.931 --> 01:33:17.500
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from June through September,</v>

2246
01:33:17.530 --> 01:33:20.660
<v Speaker 2>may through September or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it five years in a row and,</v>

2247
01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:25.740
<v Speaker 2>and one year a pack of wolves moved into</v>
<v Speaker 2>my research camp and,</v>

2248
01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:26.800
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2249
01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:28.570
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2250
01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:31.750
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went fly fishing one night and I was</v>

2251
01:33:31.751 --> 01:33:36.730
<v Speaker 2>standing on the bank of a river casting</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was an eerie little river that I</v>

2252
01:33:36.731 --> 01:33:38.710
<v Speaker 2>was on is pretty quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it had a good flow.</v>

2253
01:33:38.710 --> 01:33:40.510
<v Speaker 2>And we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was waiting for salmon to come up and</v>

2254
01:33:40.511 --> 01:33:42.910
<v Speaker 2>I was fly fishing for grayling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2255
01:33:42.911 --> 01:33:44.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just kind of had this eerie feeling.</v>

2256
01:33:44.291 --> 01:33:47.080
<v Speaker 2>I was by myself and I was just had this</v>
<v Speaker 2>eerie feeling that it's being watched.</v>

2257
01:33:47.081 --> 01:33:49.150
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I happened to look behind me.</v>

2258
01:33:49.151 --> 01:33:50.950
<v Speaker 2>And there's a big alder thicket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2259
01:33:50.951 --> 01:33:51.550
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

2260
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:53.930
<v Speaker 2>these bushes that are probably 10 to 12</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet high,</v>

2261
01:33:53.940 --> 01:33:55.720
<v Speaker 2>have green leaves on them in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>twisted,</v>

2262
01:33:55.721 --> 01:33:56.680
<v Speaker 2>gnarly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a,</v>

2263
01:33:57.310 --> 01:33:59.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boo Radley type tree,</v>

2264
01:33:59.141 --> 01:34:00.770
<v Speaker 2>like gnarly branches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was,</v>

2265
01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.610
<v Speaker 2>I was just staring in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2266
01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:04.690
<v Speaker 2>in the alders and there's grizzly bears</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I was.</v>

2267
01:34:04.691 --> 01:34:06.700
<v Speaker 2>So I was just trying to mind my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

2268
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:09.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking on wolf and Grizzly bear</v>

2269
01:34:09.411 --> 01:34:12.100
<v Speaker 2>attracts I'm fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was just staring back in the</v>

2270
01:34:12.101 --> 01:34:13.540
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2271
01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:15.160
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a movie.</v>

2272
01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:17.920
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my eyes were starting to truncate down</v>

2273
01:34:17.921 --> 01:34:20.530
<v Speaker 2>on the leaves and then all of a sudden</v>
<v Speaker 2>it came to all this little opening.</v>

2274
01:34:20.531 --> 01:34:24.110
<v Speaker 2>I could see a wolf's face staring at me</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the olders.</v>

2275
01:34:24.170 --> 01:34:28.030
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she was probably 10 yards away,</v>

2276
01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:31.450
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I saw her and when I looked at</v>

2277
01:34:31.451 --> 01:34:33.820
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was just staring at me and I just</v>

2278
01:34:33.821 --> 01:34:35.500
<v Speaker 2>looked back at her and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I just said,</v>

2279
01:34:35.501 --> 01:34:36.281
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2280
01:34:36.281 --> 01:34:37.540
<v Speaker 2>I just said hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2281
01:34:37.541 --> 01:34:38.770
<v Speaker 2>hey mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

2282
01:34:39.190 --> 01:34:42.730
<v Speaker 2>And I just kept fishing because I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>her to know that I knew and I turned my</v>

2283
01:34:42.731 --> 01:34:43.810
<v Speaker 2>back on her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept fishing.</v>

2284
01:34:43.811 --> 01:34:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Well Lo and behold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she comes out on the sandbar with me and</v>

2285
01:34:47.231 --> 01:34:50.920
<v Speaker 2>she starts walking down behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was funny cause if I didn't make</v>

2286
01:34:50.921 --> 01:34:53.530
<v Speaker 2>eye contact she was totally chill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I made eye contact,</v>

2287
01:34:53.531 --> 01:34:57.100
<v Speaker 2>she would snarl at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She raised her lips up and give a little</v>

2288
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:58.183
<v Speaker 2>seated girl</v>

2289
01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:02.330
<v Speaker 3>and so she was standing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now she's probably three feet behind me.</v>

2290
01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:03.350
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2291
01:35:03.650 --> 01:35:05.000
<v Speaker 3>And so she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's right there.</v>

2292
01:35:05.001 --> 01:35:08.120
<v Speaker 3>She's literally right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm just like,</v>

2293
01:35:08.121 --> 01:35:09.220
<v Speaker 3>hey mom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>

2294
01:35:09.230 --> 01:35:12.890
<v Speaker 3>Just cast my flyer on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like when I'm not looking at her,</v>

2295
01:35:12.891 --> 01:35:16.130
<v Speaker 3>she's kind of trying to check me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's doing the whole nose extension,</v>

2296
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:18.800
<v Speaker 3>getting a with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she moves off,</v>

2297
01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:22.520
<v Speaker 3>she moves off down that she moves off</v>
<v Speaker 3>down to have a gun on you.</v>

2298
01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.760
<v Speaker 3>I did have a 12 gauge at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I left 12 gauge slug gun.</v>

2299
01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:28.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've rarely took that thing with me.</v>

2300
01:35:28.221 --> 01:35:31.550
<v Speaker 3>But I got in trouble actually from one</v>
<v Speaker 3>of my bosses because one of the other</v>

2301
01:35:31.551 --> 01:35:35.180
<v Speaker 3>biologists told my boss is like never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he never carries the gun and we're</v>

2302
01:35:35.181 --> 01:35:36.440
<v Speaker 3>supposed to carry a gun everywhere we</v>
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

2303
01:35:36.441 --> 01:35:37.580
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2304
01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:41.300
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she laughed and I'm worried that she</v>

2305
01:35:41.301 --> 01:35:42.620
<v Speaker 3>was gonna attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2306
01:35:43.130 --> 01:35:45.620
<v Speaker 3>now she gets it so close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems weird.</v>

2307
01:35:45.890 --> 01:35:46.701
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2308
01:35:46.701 --> 01:35:48.710
<v Speaker 3>she was just checking me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's just checking me out.</v>

2309
01:35:48.711 --> 01:35:49.250
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2310
01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:50.900
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how I was reading into it anyway.</v>

2311
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:54.590
<v Speaker 3>Just by the way you were talking to her</v>
<v Speaker 3>that she realized that you weren't even</v>

2312
01:35:54.591 --> 01:35:58.430
<v Speaker 3>interested in being a threat and she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>confident that she can get the fuck away</v>

2313
01:35:58.431 --> 01:35:59.990
<v Speaker 3>from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>

2314
01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:01.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>

2315
01:36:01.131 --> 01:36:02.330
<v Speaker 3>And not a feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2316
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:04.580
<v Speaker 3>that's this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one,</v>

2317
01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:06.590
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three.</v>

2318
01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:08.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe even two and a half feet.</v>

2319
01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:10.610
<v Speaker 3>Like she was right behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could touch her.</v>

2320
01:36:10.670 --> 01:36:11.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets much better.</v>

2321
01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:14.330
<v Speaker 3>It gets much better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I end up spending a whole summer with</v>

2322
01:36:14.331 --> 01:36:17.330
<v Speaker 3>her and all the other animals in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the pack.</v>

2323
01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:21.350
<v Speaker 3>So the next day I hear her howell down</v>
<v Speaker 3>the river.</v>

2324
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:23.720
<v Speaker 3>So I'm just messing around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I hold back to her.</v>

2325
01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:26.450
<v Speaker 3>She holds back to me instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hobbled back to her.</v>

2326
01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:29.420
<v Speaker 3>All of a sudden I see her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's now standing exactly where I was</v>

2327
01:36:29.421 --> 01:36:32.150
<v Speaker 3>standing the night before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all true story.</v>

2328
01:36:32.151 --> 01:36:35.390
<v Speaker 3>She's sitting on her butt sitting</v>
<v Speaker 3>upright,</v>

2329
01:36:35.391 --> 01:36:37.970
<v Speaker 3>like you would see a German shepard</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting staring at me.</v>

2330
01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:43.010
<v Speaker 3>So I give her just a little coy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little Rah Rah Rah Rah.</v>

2331
01:36:43.670 --> 01:36:48.170
<v Speaker 3>She lays down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she maintains eye contact with me and</v>

2332
01:36:48.171 --> 01:36:52.090
<v Speaker 3>then she just sitting there staring at</v>
<v Speaker 3>me and then she sits up again and I will</v>

2333
01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:53.570
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a little one.</v>

2334
01:36:53.571 --> 01:36:56.100
<v Speaker 3>She lays down again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She just maintaining eye contact.</v>

2335
01:36:56.101 --> 01:36:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Then she leaves that night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that area,</v>

2336
01:36:59.670 --> 01:37:01.940
<v Speaker 3>the Tundra that I was on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2337
01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:05.900
<v Speaker 3>is greatly impacted by even human foot</v>
<v Speaker 3>traffic.</v>

2338
01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:08.240
<v Speaker 3>So you have to be really careful where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you step because you know,</v>

2339
01:37:08.241 --> 01:37:09.950
<v Speaker 3>your footprint will be there for a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

2340
01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:13.010
<v Speaker 3>So we'd walk on these little planks that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we made out of two by fours.</v>

2341
01:37:13.011 --> 01:37:14.900
<v Speaker 3>I would sit up on logs that were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2342
01:37:14.901 --> 01:37:18.800
<v Speaker 3>that we put and placed in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in and put a place night 10 rice slapped</v>

2343
01:37:18.801 --> 01:37:21.170
<v Speaker 3>and I had a genetics 10 where I did all</v>
<v Speaker 3>my stuff.</v>

2344
01:37:21.171 --> 01:37:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Then I had to cook 10 things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2345
01:37:23.721 --> 01:37:26.360
<v Speaker 3>but right in front of my tent I had this</v>
<v Speaker 3>little platform where I would get</v>

2346
01:37:26.361 --> 01:37:28.760
<v Speaker 3>dressed in the morning cause I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would literally live for five and a</v>

2347
01:37:28.761 --> 01:37:30.920
<v Speaker 3>half months in a little two and a half</v>
<v Speaker 3>person pup tent.</v>

2348
01:37:31.610 --> 01:37:34.580
<v Speaker 3>And so I get out in the morning and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>dressed on this little piece of wood and</v>

2349
01:37:34.581 --> 01:37:38.870
<v Speaker 3>then I'd walk to breakfast or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>or to the river in the middle of the</v>

2350
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:42.470
<v Speaker 3>night that Alpha male was sitting on my</v>
<v Speaker 3>little platform and he how old it right</v>

2351
01:37:42.471 --> 01:37:46.430
<v Speaker 3>outside my tent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I sat up and I grabbed my gun and I</v>

2352
01:37:46.431 --> 01:37:49.310
<v Speaker 3>was just sitting there and he woke me up</v>
<v Speaker 3>from a dead sleep and I was just sitting</v>

2353
01:37:49.311 --> 01:37:52.640
<v Speaker 3>there panting with my gun and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking all around and I didn't know</v>

2354
01:37:52.641 --> 01:37:54.320
<v Speaker 3>what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I heard something and I kind of</v>

2355
01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:56.130
<v Speaker 3>peeked out and I saw that it was just</v>
<v Speaker 3>big male.</v>

2356
01:37:57.310 --> 01:37:57.840
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

2357
01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.730
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not just a wolf,</v>

2358
01:37:59.731 --> 01:38:00.980
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2359
01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:04.890
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to bother me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I hung my gun back up and I just</v>

2360
01:38:04.891 --> 01:38:07.050
<v Speaker 2>aren't set my gun back down and I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>laid back down.</v>

2361
01:38:07.051 --> 01:38:10.890
<v Speaker 2>But those two instances just started</v>
<v Speaker 2>each day.</v>

2362
01:38:11.130 --> 01:38:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next day I come out and I'm walking</v>

2363
01:38:14.431 --> 01:38:19.431
<v Speaker 2>to the genetics tent and I see him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's 20 yards away and he's paralleling</v>

2364
01:38:19.531 --> 01:38:23.550
<v Speaker 2>me on this plank and I go into the cook</v>
<v Speaker 2>tent and then I'm kind of like peeking</v>

2365
01:38:23.551 --> 01:38:24.600
<v Speaker 2>out the little corners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2366
01:38:24.601 --> 01:38:25.830
<v Speaker 2>like I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2367
01:38:26.050 --> 01:38:29.910
<v Speaker 2>cause I don't know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to walk out and get</v>

2368
01:38:29.911 --> 01:38:30.571
<v Speaker 2>attacked or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2369
01:38:30.571 --> 01:38:33.000
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that they have no body</v>

2370
01:38:33.001 --> 01:38:36.840
<v Speaker 2>language of hunting whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what is their body language of</v>

2371
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:38.550
<v Speaker 2>curiosity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Curiosity.</v>

2372
01:38:38.670 --> 01:38:39.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2373
01:38:40.020 --> 01:38:41.070
<v Speaker 2>I hate to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to,</v>

2374
01:38:41.071 --> 01:38:42.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anthropomorphize.</v>

2375
01:38:43.110 --> 01:38:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was just like,</v>

2376
01:38:45.330 --> 01:38:47.790
<v Speaker 2>it was just like that movie never cry</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolf.</v>

2377
01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.980
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly how the wolves were</v>
<v Speaker 2>engaged with that movie.</v>

2378
01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Just about a researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a book by Farley Mowat of a researcher</v>

2379
01:38:54.211 --> 01:38:57.300
<v Speaker 2>that went up to the Canadian government</v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

2380
01:38:57.420 --> 01:39:01.170
<v Speaker 2>they were thinking that wolves were</v>
<v Speaker 2>decimating these caribou herds.</v>

2381
01:39:01.650 --> 01:39:05.040
<v Speaker 2>And so they sent this biologists out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there to research the wolves to see how</v>

2382
01:39:05.041 --> 01:39:08.310
<v Speaker 2>many care were they were killing in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically what the biologists found out</v>

2383
01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:11.160
<v Speaker 2>was that the wolves weren't in killing</v>
<v Speaker 2>any Caribou zero Caribou.</v>

2384
01:39:11.161 --> 01:39:13.890
<v Speaker 2>They were killing redback voles and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were fishing.</v>

2385
01:39:13.891 --> 01:39:16.140
<v Speaker 2>And they're doing other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're eating small animals,</v>

2386
01:39:16.141 --> 01:39:19.110
<v Speaker 2>which is basically a very large part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What wolves do.</v>

2387
01:39:19.111 --> 01:39:21.870
<v Speaker 2>The very small animals and occasionally</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed Caribou,</v>

2388
01:39:21.871 --> 01:39:23.970
<v Speaker 2>occasionally kill Moose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that in certain areas there,</v>

2389
01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:27.180
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can be really hardcore predators</v>

2390
01:39:27.181 --> 01:39:28.680
<v Speaker 2>and other areas that eat a lot of mice.</v>

2391
01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.540
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2392
01:39:31.110 --> 01:39:34.470
<v Speaker 2>but that's how these wolves are engaging</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the actor in this movie.</v>

2393
01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:36.000
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were kind of inquisitive.</v>

2394
01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:38.340
<v Speaker 2>They're coming around and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so these,</v>

2395
01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:40.800
<v Speaker 2>these wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were just always present.</v>

2396
01:39:40.801 --> 01:39:44.040
<v Speaker 2>Like even I would go hiking just to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>some exercise and literally three or</v>

2397
01:39:44.041 --> 01:39:47.100
<v Speaker 2>four of them would go with me and they'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>hang back like 50,</v>

2398
01:39:47.101 --> 01:39:49.560
<v Speaker 2>60 yards behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I had high for like 10 miles.</v>

2399
01:39:49.561 --> 01:39:53.370
<v Speaker 2>And then they do the whole thing with me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and returned back to camp with me.</v>

2400
01:39:53.371 --> 01:39:56.910
<v Speaker 2>And then it started to really grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2401
01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:00.240
<v Speaker 2>cause we have this research gear that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the river so that we can count</v>

2402
01:40:00.241 --> 01:40:03.900
<v Speaker 2>speciate and sample the salmon as they</v>
<v Speaker 2>swim through to go spawn.</v>

2403
01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:06.630
<v Speaker 2>But after the salmon spawn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all die,</v>

2404
01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:09.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they would spawn die and they'd</v>

2405
01:40:09.121 --> 01:40:11.010
<v Speaker 2>come back and they'd wash up on my gear.</v>

2406
01:40:11.430 --> 01:40:13.560
<v Speaker 2>And so I'd have all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why the wolves were there.</v>

2407
01:40:13.950 --> 01:40:16.710
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to eat the dead fish that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were coming back down.</v>

2408
01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:20.370
<v Speaker 2>And so as I started toss fish off on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>banks of the river,</v>

2409
01:40:20.371 --> 01:40:21.900
<v Speaker 2>usually I would just toss them back into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the river.</v>

2410
01:40:21.901 --> 01:40:25.290
<v Speaker 2>But I tossed him on the banks of fresher</v>
<v Speaker 2>fish and a,</v>

2411
01:40:25.291 --> 01:40:28.110
<v Speaker 2>the wolves started eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then our relationship just kept</v>

2412
01:40:28.111 --> 01:40:29.910
<v Speaker 2>growing and growing and growing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing.</v>

2413
01:40:29.911 --> 01:40:32.430
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I'm spending like three and a</v>

2414
01:40:32.431 --> 01:40:35.370
<v Speaker 2>half months with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you think while you were doing this,</v>

2415
01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:39.660
<v Speaker 2>this is probably how human beings and</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves developed this relationship?</v>

2416
01:40:39.661 --> 01:40:43.170
<v Speaker 2>A hundred percent a hundred percent a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent and I actually,</v>

2417
01:40:43.410 --> 01:40:46.290
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad saying this and I hope I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't offend anybody,</v>

2418
01:40:46.291 --> 01:40:49.170
<v Speaker 2>but I was working with two in you at</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys to ask them,</v>

2419
01:40:49.171 --> 01:40:50.490
<v Speaker 2>oh guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they want him to shoot all these</v>

2420
01:40:50.491 --> 01:40:53.740
<v Speaker 2>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of lied to him.</v>

2421
01:40:53.741 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 2>And I just</v>

2422
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:54.641
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2423
01:40:54.641 --> 01:40:56.080
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever seen wolves behave like</v>

2424
01:40:56.081 --> 01:40:56.891
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they said no.</v>

2425
01:40:56.891 --> 01:40:57.724
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2426
01:40:57.850 --> 01:40:59.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of your guys' beliefs,</v>

2427
01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:03.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fall that your ancestors move on into</v>

2428
01:41:03.071 --> 01:41:04.300
<v Speaker 3>the animal kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2429
01:41:04.301 --> 01:41:04.871
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2430
01:41:04.871 --> 01:41:05.501
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2431
01:41:05.501 --> 01:41:08.680
<v Speaker 3>is there a chance that some of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves could be some of your ancestors?</v>

2432
01:41:08.681 --> 01:41:11.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know that it's not true.</v>

2433
01:41:11.650 --> 01:41:13.600
<v Speaker 3>At least I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that's not true,</v>

2434
01:41:13.601 --> 01:41:14.351
<v Speaker 3>but they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2435
01:41:14.351 --> 01:41:16.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just was trying to convince these</v>

2436
01:41:16.031 --> 01:41:17.500
<v Speaker 3>guys cause they wanted to blast these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2437
01:41:17.501 --> 01:41:20.620
<v Speaker 3>And so I just convinced him not to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wolves and I feel like an asshole</v>

2438
01:41:20.621 --> 01:41:22.330
<v Speaker 3>singing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you feel like an asshole saying</v>

2439
01:41:22.331 --> 01:41:23.081
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2440
01:41:23.081 --> 01:41:24.490
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't want them to shoot the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves.</v>

2441
01:41:24.491 --> 01:41:27.130
<v Speaker 3>So I just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably a good way to rationalize.</v>

2442
01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:30.460
<v Speaker 3>I steered them down a path of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of where their minds may have gone</v>

2443
01:41:30.461 --> 01:41:31.540
<v Speaker 3>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2444
01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:32.491
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

2445
01:41:32.491 --> 01:41:34.390
<v Speaker 3>I spend time with those wolves and I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>had,</v>

2446
01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:36.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2447
01:41:36.551 --> 01:41:36.980
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2448
01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:39.450
<v Speaker 3>in the idea of management,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when we're in,</v>

2449
01:41:39.451 --> 01:41:41.830
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the short that Jamie was just playing</v>

2450
01:41:41.831 --> 01:41:42.910
<v Speaker 3>who we are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we played.</v>

2451
01:41:42.911 --> 01:41:45.790
<v Speaker 3>You can see some wolves in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a few years ago I got surrounded by</v>

2452
01:41:45.791 --> 01:41:50.050
<v Speaker 3>a pack of wolves in the Arctic with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>crew and it films really beautifully.</v>

2453
01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:52.690
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was one of the most remarkable</v>

2454
01:41:52.691 --> 01:41:54.460
<v Speaker 3>engagements I've ever had in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>wilderness.</v>

2455
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:56.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were definitely,</v>

2456
01:41:56.770 --> 01:42:01.770
<v Speaker 3>their body language was definitely</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at us as though are we food?</v>

2457
01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:04.090
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>

2458
01:42:04.091 --> 01:42:06.700
<v Speaker 3>that was one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we had like six or seven wolves come</v>

2459
01:42:06.701 --> 01:42:09.490
<v Speaker 3>in behind us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this wolf would be in front of us,</v>

2460
01:42:09.730 --> 01:42:11.060
<v Speaker 3>two or three others would be behind</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2461
01:42:11.070 --> 01:42:13.330
<v Speaker 3>but you can see they're not attacking</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

2462
01:42:13.330 --> 01:42:15.070
<v Speaker 3>They're not even hunting us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can just see,</v>

2463
01:42:15.071 --> 01:42:16.270
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're wondering,</v>

2464
01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:18.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there,</v>

2465
01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:20.050
<v Speaker 3>is there a play here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2466
01:42:20.051 --> 01:42:21.280
<v Speaker 3>Is there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a play here?</v>

2467
01:42:21.281 --> 01:42:22.270
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2468
01:42:22.271 --> 01:42:23.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

2469
01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:24.580
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean there's,</v>

2470
01:42:24.581 --> 01:42:27.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm not being a tough guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't an ounce that I didn't have</v>

2471
01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:31.510
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a fiber of my body was afraid at any</v>

2472
01:42:31.511 --> 01:42:32.740
<v Speaker 3>point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's probably six,</v>

2473
01:42:32.741 --> 01:42:37.480
<v Speaker 3>seven molds around us within 10 yards</v>
<v Speaker 3>all and they're communicating,</v>

2474
01:42:37.481 --> 01:42:39.440
<v Speaker 3>they're doing this little like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah.</v>

2475
01:42:39.490 --> 01:42:42.940
<v Speaker 3>So they're talking to each other and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then they just moved off and it turns</v>

2476
01:42:42.941 --> 01:42:46.180
<v Speaker 3>out that the w the Moose that I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>stalking,</v>

2477
01:42:46.181 --> 01:42:49.150
<v Speaker 3>I think they were stocking too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause there was a big bowl that was</v>

2478
01:42:49.151 --> 01:42:53.500
<v Speaker 3>bedded and if they weren't stocking him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I think they would have had their</v>

2479
01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:56.290
<v Speaker 3>hands full with him for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they weren't stocking him then they</v>

2480
01:42:56.291 --> 01:42:58.060
<v Speaker 3>were just moving in that general</v>
<v Speaker 3>direction in a,</v>

2481
01:42:58.180 --> 01:42:59.800
<v Speaker 3>they were for sure hunting.</v>

2482
01:43:00.490 --> 01:43:03.400
<v Speaker 3>And I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always had a tremendous respect for</v>

2483
01:43:03.401 --> 01:43:06.370
<v Speaker 3>them and I've always spent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've just,</v>

2484
01:43:06.810 --> 01:43:08.740
<v Speaker 3>I've always had time with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always had time.</v>

2485
01:43:08.741 --> 01:43:12.700
<v Speaker 3>And then I've always been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had wolf tags in my pocket before.</v>

2486
01:43:12.820 --> 01:43:16.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of falls under the same idea</v>

2487
01:43:16.211 --> 01:43:18.100
<v Speaker 3>of conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like these walls right here.</v>

2488
01:43:18.101 --> 01:43:19.630
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a wolf tag in my pocket.</v>

2489
01:43:19.631 --> 01:43:22.210
<v Speaker 3>I had my bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could've arrowed any of these wolves,</v>

2490
01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:24.370
<v Speaker 3>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Multiples of them probably.</v>

2491
01:43:24.850 --> 01:43:27.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't want to kill a wolf here</v>

2492
01:43:27.101 --> 01:43:28.200
<v Speaker 3>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2493
01:43:28.990 --> 01:43:31.300
<v Speaker 3>they know when another wolf has gone</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2494
01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:32.410
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pack knows.</v>

2495
01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:35.290
<v Speaker 3>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that weighs on me a little bit.</v>

2496
01:43:35.291 --> 01:43:36.041
<v Speaker 3>That's me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're so,</v>

2497
01:43:36.041 --> 01:43:36.910
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2498
01:43:36.911 --> 01:43:37.850
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why kill him?</v>

2499
01:43:38.050 --> 01:43:42.130
<v Speaker 3>Like what is there too many of them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a real issue.</v>

2500
01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:43.960
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the thing for me is like I</v>

2501
01:43:43.961 --> 01:43:46.330
<v Speaker 3>didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do my homework for this area,</v>

2502
01:43:46.331 --> 01:43:48.760
<v Speaker 3>so I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno if there's a lot of wolves.</v>

2503
01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:50.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't under the little wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to kill the wolf.</v>

2504
01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:53.780
<v Speaker 3>I've no interest in killing wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get a wolf tag with my stuff.</v>

2505
01:43:54.290 --> 01:43:58.280
<v Speaker 3>Rinella was telling me that there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the explorers that traveled the</v>

2506
01:43:58.281 --> 01:44:02.120
<v Speaker 3>West during the Lewis and Clark days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his favorite meal was wolf.</v>

2507
01:44:02.670 --> 01:44:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that wolf was literally his favorite</v>

2508
01:44:05.751 --> 01:44:08.360
<v Speaker 3>thing to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never eaten it.</v>

2509
01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have a real hard time.</v>

2510
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:14.250
<v Speaker 3>I just couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are too much like dogs there.</v>

2511
01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:19.010
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some sort of a genetic</v>
<v Speaker 3>memory that we have of our relationship</v>

2512
01:44:19.011 --> 01:44:20.010
<v Speaker 3>with wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've,</v>

2513
01:44:20.190 --> 01:44:22.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've become dogs and they've become</v>

2514
01:44:22.371 --> 01:44:23.960
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2515
01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:28.190
<v Speaker 3>our companions and they become a part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>our community.</v>

2516
01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.410
<v Speaker 3>It just wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2517
01:44:30.650 --> 01:44:31.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't for me.</v>

2518
01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:34.130
<v Speaker 3>And when the pilot picked me up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he asked me if I'd seen any wolves and I</v>

2519
01:44:34.131 --> 01:44:34.461
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2520
01:44:34.461 --> 01:44:37.640
<v Speaker 3>we saw a lot of wolves and how he's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>all there now,</v>

2521
01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:39.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not,</v>

2522
01:44:39.171 --> 01:44:40.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm not telling you is running surveys</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

2523
01:44:40.701 --> 01:44:41.151
<v Speaker 3>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2524
01:44:41.151 --> 01:44:42.080
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of wolves here.</v>

2525
01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:44.330
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of predation on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Moose here.</v>

2526
01:44:44.331 --> 01:44:46.690
<v Speaker 3>So we're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to really cut the wolves</v>

2527
01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:47.351
<v Speaker 3>down here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

2528
01:44:47.351 --> 01:44:50.960
<v Speaker 3>and I saw a lot of wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I also saw a ton of Moose and I saw</v>

2529
01:44:50.961 --> 01:44:54.620
<v Speaker 3>a ton of cows and I saw lots of calves</v>
<v Speaker 3>and lots of big bowls.</v>

2530
01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:57.470
<v Speaker 3>So everything seemed to be functioning</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that area.</v>

2531
01:44:57.471 --> 01:44:59.890
<v Speaker 3>And I also saw a ton of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2532
01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:02.420
<v Speaker 3>back vols right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They look like mice with little short</v>

2533
01:45:02.421 --> 01:45:04.230
<v Speaker 3>tails.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know where there's a lot of red</v>

2534
01:45:04.231 --> 01:45:07.730
<v Speaker 3>back vols I know the wolves do extremely</v>
<v Speaker 3>well eating them.</v>

2535
01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:10.850
<v Speaker 3>And so you see these little tunnels</v>
<v Speaker 3>right in the Tundra and stuff.</v>

2536
01:45:10.851 --> 01:45:12.140
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2537
01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:16.370
<v Speaker 3>I think wolves eat a lot smaller of prey</v>
<v Speaker 3>than people think on average.</v>

2538
01:45:16.371 --> 01:45:20.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We see sensational things of small dogs</v>

2539
01:45:20.061 --> 01:45:20.900
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or wolves.</v>

2540
01:45:20.901 --> 01:45:21.910
<v Speaker 3>And we filmed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if,</v>

2541
01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:24.710
<v Speaker 3>did you see the Dingo Hunt that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>filmed in Australia?</v>

2542
01:45:24.770 --> 01:45:26.270
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2543
01:45:26.650 --> 01:45:28.330
<v Speaker 3>And I was wondering a Dingo Hunt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

2544
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:32.330
<v Speaker 3>We were hunting buffalo and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while we were hunting Buffalo Dingo has</v>

2545
01:45:32.331 --> 01:45:35.210
<v Speaker 3>just exploded from the bush and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>dingoes.</v>

2546
01:45:35.211 --> 01:45:38.210
<v Speaker 3>We're pack hunting the Asiatic water</v>
<v Speaker 3>buffaloes.</v>

2547
01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:41.690
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's ever seen it before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's ever filmed it before.</v>

2548
01:45:41.691 --> 01:45:45.050
<v Speaker 3>We had the Dingo institute call us</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately from Australia.</v>

2549
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:48.530
<v Speaker 3>We had Dingo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small,</v>

2550
01:45:48.531 --> 01:45:50.990
<v Speaker 3>tiny dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we filmed all that is not straight.</v>

2551
01:45:50.991 --> 01:45:53.240
<v Speaker 3>It's literally never been filmed before</v>
<v Speaker 3>to our knowledge.</v>

2552
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:55.190
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone that we talked to that is Dingo</v>

2553
01:45:55.191 --> 01:45:57.140
<v Speaker 3>researchers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to know exactly where this was</v>

2554
01:45:57.141 --> 01:45:59.870
<v Speaker 3>because I'd never seen this behavior and</v>
<v Speaker 3>see this behavior right here,</v>

2555
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:04.520
<v Speaker 3>that was actually coming in to hunt Das.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can see the whole crew sat down.</v>

2556
01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:08.060
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was totally committed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to kill that calf right</v>

2557
01:46:08.061 --> 01:46:10.400
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And still that calf is monstrous,</v>

2558
01:46:10.401 --> 01:46:12.500
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's four or five,</v>

2559
01:46:12.501 --> 01:46:13.220
<v Speaker 3>six on there.</v>

2560
01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:17.120
<v Speaker 3>And then they chase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stampede the whole herd directly</v>

2561
01:46:17.121 --> 01:46:19.160
<v Speaker 3>right into us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you're seeing right here.</v>

2562
01:46:19.161 --> 01:46:22.670
<v Speaker 3>And that the heard actually comes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 15 feet before they split around</v>

2563
01:46:22.671 --> 01:46:24.860
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all sitting on our butts and then</v>

2564
01:46:24.861 --> 01:46:28.910
<v Speaker 3>the dingoes actually turn their</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to us and they come in around</v>

2565
01:46:28.911 --> 01:46:29.391
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>

2566
01:46:29.391 --> 01:46:31.400
<v Speaker 3>cause you can see us instantly looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>at us as a,</v>

2567
01:46:31.401 --> 01:46:33.500
<v Speaker 3>we're a meal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like wolves,</v>

2568
01:46:33.620 --> 01:46:35.690
<v Speaker 3>like grizzly bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like black bears,</v>

2569
01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:37.480
<v Speaker 3>very quickly they look at you and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>got,</v>

2570
01:46:37.481 --> 01:46:40.130
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not going to work out for me.</v>

2571
01:46:40.190 --> 01:46:42.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to die.</v>

2572
01:46:42.621 --> 01:46:43.490
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

2573
01:46:43.491 --> 01:46:45.090
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody had ever seen die.</v>

2574
01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:47.810
<v Speaker 3>Why the fuck are they going after water</v>
<v Speaker 3>bottle?</v>

2575
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.530
<v Speaker 3>Terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But obviously there,</v>

2576
01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:54.960
<v Speaker 3>I dunno if this group has done this</v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

2577
01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:57.390
<v Speaker 3>Well they must've ride.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The must have been successful on the</v>

2578
01:46:57.391 --> 01:46:58.560
<v Speaker 3>calf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2579
01:46:58.561 --> 01:47:02.550
<v Speaker 3>and the idea is that they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>chase him and wear him out and that one</v>

2580
01:47:02.551 --> 01:47:04.620
<v Speaker 3>of the cavs going to be separated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to take it down.</v>

2581
01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:06.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they're like 35 pounds.</v>

2582
01:47:07.170 --> 01:47:09.450
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a small animal.</v>

2583
01:47:09.451 --> 01:47:12.060
<v Speaker 3>And these calves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the calves are probably like a</v>

2584
01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:14.610
<v Speaker 3>hundred pounds</v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger.</v>

2585
01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:16.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe even 200.</v>

2586
01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:19.170
<v Speaker 3>That Guy Looks Australia is fuck the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other guy.</v>

2587
01:47:19.171 --> 01:47:20.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's barefoot and everything.</v>

2588
01:47:20.610 --> 01:47:21.540
<v Speaker 3>I might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2589
01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got my hat.</v>

2590
01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:27.360
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just all these instances like this,</v>

2591
01:47:27.390 --> 01:47:28.390
<v Speaker 3>literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate to,</v>

2592
01:47:29.530 --> 01:47:33.690
<v Speaker 3>but this why I hunt like that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

2593
01:47:33.691 --> 01:47:36.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably not going on a photo safari</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever in my entire life.</v>

2594
01:47:36.481 --> 01:47:40.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm not climbing Mount Everest unless</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something at the top that I'm</v>

2595
01:47:40.410 --> 01:47:41.230
<v Speaker 3>need.</v>

2596
01:47:41.230 --> 01:47:43.660
<v Speaker 3>It's just not men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My DNA is not who I am,</v>

2597
01:47:43.870 --> 01:47:45.780
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but going out to,</v>

2598
01:47:46.170 --> 01:47:48.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill a water buffalo in Australia</v>

2599
01:47:48.781 --> 01:47:51.300
<v Speaker 3>because they're not only are they</v>
<v Speaker 3>overpopulated,</v>

2600
01:47:51.301 --> 01:47:54.150
<v Speaker 3>they're absolutely decimating the</v>
<v Speaker 3>country and they're not supposed to be</v>

2601
01:47:54.151 --> 01:47:54.551
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2602
01:47:54.551 --> 01:47:55.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he killed them all.</v>

2603
01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:59.580
<v Speaker 3>You could snap your fingers right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill every buffalo in on the continent</v>

2604
01:47:59.581 --> 01:48:01.950
<v Speaker 3>of Australia and you'd be doing nothing</v>
<v Speaker 3>but helping that place.</v>

2605
01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:03.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2606
01:48:03.061 --> 01:48:05.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the kinds of engagements that</v>

2607
01:48:05.611 --> 01:48:06.390
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2608
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:08.490
<v Speaker 3>Going there and seeing these things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to see him unless</v>

2609
01:48:08.491 --> 01:48:10.500
<v Speaker 3>you're there and you're not gonna see</v>
<v Speaker 3>him unless you're there for very long</v>

2610
01:48:10.501 --> 01:48:11.760
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2611
01:48:12.110 --> 01:48:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Being in the woods and seeing wildlife</v>
<v Speaker 1>in its wild environment is a crazy</v>

2612
01:48:17.661 --> 01:48:19.910
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was telling my friend Colton,</v>

2613
01:48:19.911 --> 01:48:24.911
<v Speaker 1>he's a guide in Utah and I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys should have a thing for people</v>

2614
01:48:25.221 --> 01:48:28.430
<v Speaker 1>that have zero desire to hunt and let</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

2615
01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:31.430
<v Speaker 1>like take them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them in full cammo and have them</v>

2616
01:48:31.431 --> 01:48:36.431
<v Speaker 1>creep through the woods during the Rut</v>
<v Speaker 1>and watch these elk scream at each other</v>

2617
01:48:36.441 --> 01:48:39.470
<v Speaker 1>and communicate and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to be around them is amazing.</v>

2618
01:48:39.850 --> 01:48:42.080
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing cause then to know that</v>

2619
01:48:42.081 --> 01:48:44.690
<v Speaker 1>these things have done this for</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands,</v>

2620
01:48:44.691 --> 01:48:48.410
<v Speaker 1>if not millions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've found whitetail deer</v>

2621
01:48:48.411 --> 01:48:53.411
<v Speaker 1>skulls in Florida that have been age to</v>
<v Speaker 1>over a million years.</v>

2622
01:48:54.230 --> 01:48:59.230
<v Speaker 1>So they know that they've been in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>form and likely elk as well in that form</v>

2623
01:48:59.421 --> 01:49:01.790
<v Speaker 1>for a fucking million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even more years.</v>

2624
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:03.890
<v Speaker 1>These things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what they've done.</v>

2625
01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:06.440
<v Speaker 1>They've done it forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to be around them when they don't</v>

2626
01:49:06.441 --> 01:49:07.840
<v Speaker 1>know you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2627
01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:09.900
<v Speaker 1>we did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a film for underarmor,</v>

2628
01:49:09.970 --> 01:49:14.000
<v Speaker 1>me and a Cam Haynes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we went elk hunting and Utah and we,</v>

2629
01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:16.280
<v Speaker 1>we were in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2630
01:49:16.910 --> 01:49:21.500
<v Speaker 1>this wooded area watching these elk that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were in this meadow by a stream.</v>

2631
01:49:21.501 --> 01:49:24.830
<v Speaker 1>And we sat there waiting for a shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for like,</v>

2632
01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:28.220
<v Speaker 1>like an hour or so watching them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had no idea we were there.</v>

2633

<v Speaker 1>It's so amazing.</v>

2638
01:49:35.730 --> 01:49:37.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wash and breathe.</v>

2639
01:49:37.201 --> 01:49:39.000

<v Speaker 3>it was trippy.</v>

2643
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm talking to the art director at</v>
<v Speaker 3>men's hall.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They have no idea what life is about.</v>

2645
01:49:52.121 --> 01:49:53.800
<v Speaker 3>So she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had Donnie.</v>

2646
01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:55.960
<v Speaker 3>So what we're gonna do is we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you and your crew.</v>

2647
01:49:55.961 --> 01:50:00.220
<v Speaker 3>So there's three in my crew and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have a photographer,</v>

2648
01:50:00.221 --> 01:50:03.070
<v Speaker 3>photographers assistant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we'll have the writer with you.</v>

2649
01:50:03.190 --> 01:50:04.930
<v Speaker 3>Well good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm just like,</v>

2650
01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:07.750
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm stocking bull elk and I've never</v>

2651
01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:10.150
<v Speaker 3>elk hunted before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I have no idea what I'm doing other</v>

2652
01:50:10.151 --> 01:50:14.020
<v Speaker 3>than what I've read about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm stocking these bowls with six</v>

2653
01:50:14.021 --> 01:50:15.670
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they asked me like,</v>

2654
01:50:15.671 --> 01:50:17.020
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we have to wear camouflage that no,</v>

2655
01:50:17.021 --> 01:50:18.040
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to wear camouflage.</v>

2656
01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:20.320
<v Speaker 3>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well what is there anything we shouldn't</v>

2657
01:50:20.321 --> 01:50:20.861
<v Speaker 3>wear?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

2658
01:50:20.861 --> 01:50:24.700
<v Speaker 3>just try not to wear anything with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>really bright start colors and try not</v>

2659
01:50:24.701 --> 01:50:26.740
<v Speaker 3>to wear any bright yellows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's the spectrum.</v>

2660
01:50:26.741 --> 01:50:29.940
<v Speaker 3>That elk scene and the photographer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>photographer assistant shows off with</v>

2661
01:50:29.950 --> 01:50:31.990
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like canary,</v>

2662
01:50:31.991 --> 01:50:33.760
<v Speaker 3>yellow pants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>skinny jeans.</v>

2663
01:50:33.850 --> 01:50:37.090
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like eight from Ohi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's a little high that's here,</v>

2664
01:50:37.091 --> 01:50:38.330
<v Speaker 3>right in southern California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2665
01:50:38.331 --> 01:50:40.400
<v Speaker 3>So they're from Ohio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2666
01:50:40.620 --> 01:50:43.150
<v Speaker 3>but it was wicked cause we snuck up to</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight.</v>

2667
01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:46.510
<v Speaker 3>We got to 18 yards from the six by six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of us,</v>

2668
01:50:46.570 --> 01:50:49.000
<v Speaker 3>six of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>18 yards from the six by six.</v>

2669
01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:53.110
<v Speaker 3>And what was crazy is there staring at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the six by six,</v>

2670
01:50:53.111 --> 01:50:55.510
<v Speaker 3>like all of their jaws are on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground,</v>

2671
01:50:55.930 --> 01:51:00.010
<v Speaker 3>but I'm staring at them because I really</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't care about the six by six.</v>

2672
01:51:00.011 --> 01:51:01.300
<v Speaker 3>He's too young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to shoot him.</v>

2673
01:51:01.301 --> 01:51:04.540
<v Speaker 3>But I loved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was addicted to their reactions and</v>

2674
01:51:04.541 --> 01:51:07.330
<v Speaker 3>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the elk Wa actually,</v>

2675
01:51:07.331 --> 01:51:10.240
<v Speaker 3>so we're staring at them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the elk staring at these guys.</v>

2676
01:51:10.241 --> 01:51:12.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm staring at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like taking this on.</v>

2677
01:51:12.110 --> 01:51:13.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is pretty Rad.</v>

2678
01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:18.450
<v Speaker 3>Nevada Shell Creek range in Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2679
01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.040
<v Speaker 3>and so we're sending,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden the elk looks to its</v>

2680
01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:25.780
<v Speaker 3>left really sharply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I look over and there's a coyote</v>

2681
01:51:26.170 --> 01:51:29.800
<v Speaker 3>10 yards from us staring at the ELAC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then all these guys are seeing the</v>

2682
01:51:29.801 --> 01:51:31.030
<v Speaker 3>Chi out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing the ELAC.</v>

2683
01:51:31.031 --> 01:51:33.910
<v Speaker 3>And then everything runs away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I turn around and look at these guys</v>

2684
01:51:33.911 --> 01:51:36.400
<v Speaker 3>and they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2685
01:51:36.540 --> 01:51:37.990
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2686
01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:39.880
<v Speaker 3>the one photographer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2687
01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:44.860
<v Speaker 3>that was a literal monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like a three year old,</v>

2688
01:51:44.861 --> 01:51:47.710
<v Speaker 3>six by six and four year old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>66 and he's like that thing.</v>

2689
01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:51.700
<v Speaker 3>And like I just shut up and I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 3>living in these guys and they're just</v>

2690
01:51:51.701 --> 01:51:54.250
<v Speaker 3>Jay and now two of the three of them on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hunt,</v>

2691
01:51:54.790 --> 01:51:56.860
<v Speaker 3>they'd never hunt in their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that writer,</v>

2692
01:51:56.861 --> 01:51:59.140
<v Speaker 3>writer Michael Easter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he really wants to hunt and he's</v>

2693
01:51:59.141 --> 01:52:00.820
<v Speaker 3>actually going to go on another hunt</v>
<v Speaker 3>with me I think.</v>

2694
01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:04.230
<v Speaker 3>And next year I'm going to spend like 40</v>
<v Speaker 3>days in the Yukon territories,</v>

2695
01:52:04.270 --> 01:52:08.080
<v Speaker 3>just walking from one end to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>concession that a friend of mine has</v>

2696
01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:11.020
<v Speaker 3>like four and a half million acres.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to try to walk from one half</v>

2697
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Kinda to the other half if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in hunting our way through just kind of</v>

2698
01:52:14.441 --> 01:52:15.610
<v Speaker 3>doing journal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunt film,</v>

2699
01:52:15.611 --> 01:52:18.070
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Beautifully tried to and tell a story</v>

2700
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:21.400
<v Speaker 3>and he wants to go along and write a</v>
<v Speaker 3>book about the experience.</v>

2701
01:52:21.970 --> 01:52:22.803
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2702
01:52:23.410 --> 01:52:24.700
<v Speaker 3>but that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like all these guys,</v>

2703
01:52:24.701 --> 01:52:26.470
<v Speaker 3>like they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just to see their look,</v>

2704

<v Speaker 3>like in,</v>

2705
01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:31.030

<v Speaker 3>he put on quite a show.</v>

2706
01:52:31.031 --> 01:52:32.500
<v Speaker 3>He didn't bugle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really wish you would have,</v>

2707
01:52:32.501 --> 01:52:35.410
<v Speaker 3>although they heard bugles cause we</v>
<v Speaker 3>camped at 12,000 feet.</v>

2708
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:37.180
<v Speaker 3>I made them hike all the way up to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>top.</v>

2709
01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:38.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm like man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're camping cabin at the tippity</v>

<v Speaker 3>around the canyon but they watched him</v>

2720
01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:05.270
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2723
01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:10.820
<v Speaker 3>Just a small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small curvature.</v>

2724
01:53:11.100 --> 01:53:11.570
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2725
01:53:11.570 --> 01:53:14.090
<v Speaker 3>he's been on a cavaliers tear over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last few days.</v>

2726
01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:16.280
<v Speaker 3>All sorts of different hats on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2727
01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:17.240
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2728
01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:18.350
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

2729
01:53:18.351 --> 01:53:20.120
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was saying to these guys is like,</v>

2730
01:53:20.150 --> 01:53:22.730
<v Speaker 3>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without even having to have a tag,</v>

2731
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.990
<v Speaker 3>like you guys could guide these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it wouldn't be a dent and the</v>

2732
01:53:26.991 --> 01:53:30.140
<v Speaker 3>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't diminish the population.</v>

2733
01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:30.860
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would,</v>

2734
01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:34.670
<v Speaker 3>it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an educational experience and just,</v>

2735
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:37.580
<v Speaker 3>there's ripples that come from that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people are going to go back and</v>

2736
01:53:37.581 --> 01:53:40.250
<v Speaker 3>tell other people about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's one thing to go to the zoo,</v>

2737
01:53:40.251 --> 01:53:42.980
<v Speaker 3>but you go to the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the most unnatural environment,</v>

2738
01:53:42.981 --> 01:53:44.990
<v Speaker 3>the world where animals are looking you</v>
<v Speaker 3>right in the eye and they're not</v>

2739
01:53:44.991 --> 01:53:47.690
<v Speaker 3>freaking out that that has nothing to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>with what you're talking about.</v>

2740
01:53:47.900 --> 01:53:49.880
<v Speaker 3>Those two things you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll cut at the zoo,</v>

2741
01:53:49.881 --> 01:53:53.400
<v Speaker 3>but you can't watch an elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The elk is not an alk.</v>

2742
01:53:53.410 --> 01:53:55.130
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a farm animal.</v>

2743
01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:58.250
<v Speaker 3>It's just not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you see one in the wild and</v>

2744
01:53:58.251 --> 01:54:00.470
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their noses are flaring and they're</v>

2745
01:54:00.471 --> 01:54:01.770
<v Speaker 3>smelling the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're,</v>

2746
01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:06.260
<v Speaker 3>their ears are twitching left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's scanning for noises and you realize</v>

2747
01:54:06.261 --> 01:54:06.711
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2748
01:54:06.711 --> 01:54:09.740
<v Speaker 3>this thing is out there fucking earning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hustling,</v>

2749
01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:10.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eating grass,</v>

2750
01:54:10.971 --> 01:54:12.110
<v Speaker 3>trying to stay alive.</v>

2751
01:54:12.110 --> 01:54:14.030
<v Speaker 3>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it gets to,</v>

2752
01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:16.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that elk that I have out there was</v>

2753
01:54:16.131 --> 01:54:19.670
<v Speaker 3>nine years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a nine year old animal that's out there</v>

2754
01:54:19.671 --> 01:54:24.671
<v Speaker 3>surviving against mountain lions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>bears and just figuring out a way to get</v>

2755
01:54:25.071 --> 01:54:28.760
<v Speaker 3>through and keep surviving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get through those winters,</v>

2756
01:54:28.761 --> 01:54:30.620
<v Speaker 3>make it to spring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep going,</v>

2757
01:54:30.621 --> 01:54:32.510
<v Speaker 3>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that is uh,</v>

2758
01:54:32.590 --> 01:54:34.430
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an amazing animal.</v>

2759
01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:36.740
<v Speaker 3>Has a story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing has a story and you,</v>

2760
01:54:36.741 --> 01:54:38.870
<v Speaker 3>and if you sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2761
01:54:38.930 --> 01:54:40.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you were sad when you kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2762
01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:44.630
<v Speaker 3>but you sit down and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm sure you were euphoric as hell</v>

2763
01:54:44.631 --> 01:54:49.610
<v Speaker 3>that your plan finally worked because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've watched it fail 2000 times.</v>

2764
01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:53.720
<v Speaker 3>So you sit there with your kind of holy</v>
<v Speaker 3>crap moment of this actually happened</v>

2765
01:54:53.721 --> 01:54:56.810
<v Speaker 3>and he's actually dead now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2766
01:54:56.811 --> 01:54:58.760
<v Speaker 3>you have the sorrow of taking an</v>
<v Speaker 3>animal's life,</v>

2767
01:54:58.761 --> 01:55:01.040
<v Speaker 3>but then you sit there and you have any</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective at all.</v>

2768
01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:03.570
<v Speaker 3>You think about those nine years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like you just did you think like</v>

2769
01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:05.960
<v Speaker 3>any minute of those nine years and he'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>say much like sheep,</v>

2770
01:55:05.961 --> 01:55:06.794
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or like,</v>

2771
01:55:06.930 --> 01:55:08.420
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your water buffalo back here,</v>

2772
01:55:08.421 --> 01:55:09.560
<v Speaker 3>like this is horn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2773
01:55:09.561 --> 01:55:13.040
<v Speaker 3>So they don't lose it every year that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the l cast their antlers off every year</v>

2774
01:55:13.041 --> 01:55:14.090
<v Speaker 3>and grow new ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

2775
01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:18.050
<v Speaker 3>I think it's fastest growing biological</v>
<v Speaker 3>substance known to man.</v>

2776
01:55:18.051 --> 01:55:19.270
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So crazy.</v>

2777
01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:20.730
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but these things have horn,</v>

2778
01:55:20.731 --> 01:55:23.780
<v Speaker 3>so it's made out of like fingernail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you literally can sit there with your</v>

2779
01:55:23.781 --> 01:55:28.250
<v Speaker 3>buffalo and track your fingernail or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>big horn sheep are dall sheep and drag</v>

2780
01:55:28.251 --> 01:55:31.520
<v Speaker 3>your finger nail through these little</v>
<v Speaker 3>cracks and you see the splits and cracks</v>

2781
01:55:31.521 --> 01:55:33.140
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2782
01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:37.190
<v Speaker 3>what was a bad winter and what was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>great spring?</v>

2783
01:55:37.191 --> 01:55:38.990
<v Speaker 3>And when did the wolves chase you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2784
01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:41.180
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did you almost lose your life in a</v>

2785
01:55:41.181 --> 01:55:43.880
<v Speaker 3>fight?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when like I wish,</v>

2786
01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:45.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish we could kind of hold on to these</v>

2787
01:55:45.721 --> 01:55:49.500
<v Speaker 3>things and kind of go through a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>montage of what to sing live through,</v>

2788
01:55:49.501 --> 01:55:51.120
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the only thing we can do is</v>

2789
01:55:51.121 --> 01:55:54.840
<v Speaker 3>insert ourselves into the wilderness for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a short amount of time or as much time</v>

2790
01:55:54.841 --> 01:55:56.110
<v Speaker 3>as we can afford and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2791
01:55:56.130 --> 01:55:59.520
<v Speaker 3>and</v>
<v Speaker 3>convince ourselves that that's where we</v>

2792
01:55:59.521 --> 01:56:01.440
<v Speaker 3>still live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2793
01:56:01.530 --> 01:56:03.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean that just</v>

2794
01:56:03.550 --> 01:56:06.100
<v Speaker 1>the relationship that we have with</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature I think is,</v>

2795
01:56:06.190 --> 01:56:08.830
<v Speaker 1>it's taken such a bizarre turn because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cities.</v>

2796
01:56:09.370 --> 01:56:14.080
<v Speaker 1>I think that what we've done also in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with animals,</v>

2797
01:56:14.081 --> 01:56:18.100
<v Speaker 1>by putting them in these little animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>prisons that we call zoos and having</v>

2798
01:56:18.101 --> 01:56:21.730
<v Speaker 1>people go and stare at them and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unnatural way,</v>

2799
01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:27.180
<v Speaker 1>we've really distorted the majesty of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildlife and nature.</v>

2800
01:56:27.790 --> 01:56:29.560
<v Speaker 1>And the only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

2801
01:56:29.561 --> 01:56:33.730
<v Speaker 1>the only real way to appreciate what an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what an animal is,</v>

2802
01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.690
<v Speaker 1>is to see an animal in the wild to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in its habitat.</v>

2803
01:56:37.691 --> 01:56:40.180
<v Speaker 1>And until that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until you do that,</v>

2804
01:56:40.181 --> 01:56:42.280
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see a,</v>

2805
01:56:42.790 --> 01:56:45.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a giraffe at the zoo and they're pretty</v>

2806
01:56:45.731 --> 01:56:47.380
<v Speaker 1>majestic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really crazy.</v>

2807
01:56:47.381 --> 01:56:50.410
<v Speaker 1>And they're one of the weirdest animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>too because they let little kids feed</v>

2808
01:56:50.411 --> 01:56:51.191
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2809
01:56:51.191 --> 01:56:56.191
<v Speaker 1>they're so confident in their behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ms. I had a a bit about it in my act and</v>

2810
01:56:56.231 --> 01:56:58.810
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you say that animals don't belong</v>

2811
01:56:58.811 --> 01:56:59.260
<v Speaker 1>in the zoo.</v>

2812
01:56:59.260 --> 01:57:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2813
01:57:00.500 --> 01:57:05.500
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you except for giraffes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Xerox don't seem to have any fucking</v>

2814
01:57:05.531 --> 01:57:07.270
<v Speaker 1>problem with the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love it.</v>

2815
01:57:07.450 --> 01:57:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My joke was that they're like another</v>

2816
01:57:10.031 --> 01:57:13.480
<v Speaker 1>day with no lions and they're just</v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering around having a great old</v>

2817
01:57:13.481 --> 01:57:14.314
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2818
01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:16.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so confident that like when my</v>

2819
01:57:16.841 --> 01:57:19.390
<v Speaker 1>daughter was two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we brought her to the zoo and they'll</v>

2820
01:57:19.391 --> 01:57:22.180
<v Speaker 1>let a two year old hold a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lettuce up for a giraffe.</v>

2821
01:57:22.210 --> 01:57:23.290
<v Speaker 1>They just fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2822
01:57:23.370 --> 01:57:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you saw a g,</v>

2823
01:57:26.290 --> 01:57:27.730
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time I ever saw him,</v>

2824
01:57:27.731 --> 01:57:30.610
<v Speaker 1>I was from my friend Mike Hawk Ridge and</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Ben O'brian,</v>

2825
01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:32.380
<v Speaker 1>the first time I ever saw a moose in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild,</v>

2826
01:57:32.620 --> 01:57:36.220
<v Speaker 1>we pulled the car over and it was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that scene in Jurassic Park when Jeff</v>

2827
01:57:36.220 --> 01:57:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Goldbloom sticks his head out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>jeep and he's like,</v>

2828
01:57:38.290 --> 01:57:41.650
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you see one in the wild,</v>

2829
01:57:41.651 --> 01:57:45.340
<v Speaker 1>you realize how big they really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this thing was just walking through</v>

2830
01:57:45.341 --> 01:57:48.100
<v Speaker 1>this open field in the woods and we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2831
01:57:48.101 --> 01:57:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of that thing.</v>

2832
01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Filmmaker killed by Giraffe by working</v>
<v Speaker 1>in South Africa.</v>

2833
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got headbutted,</v>

2834
01:57:56.081 --> 01:57:56.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2835
01:57:57.040 --> 01:57:58.300
<v Speaker 1>That's how they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2836
01:57:58.301 --> 01:57:58.801
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2837
01:57:58.801 --> 01:58:03.580
<v Speaker 1>they use their head like a whip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We showed a film of these two battling</v>

2838
01:58:03.581 --> 01:58:06.220
<v Speaker 1>these two bulls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slam each other with their heads.</v>

2839
01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:07.830
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Total.</v>

2840
01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:10.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As is anything that lives out there.</v>

2841
01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:11.770
<v Speaker 3>That's a way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

2842
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:14.440
<v Speaker 3>Get killed by a giraffe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You didn't even see it.</v>

2843
01:58:14.441 --> 01:58:16.300
<v Speaker 3>He was looking through the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2844
01:58:16.301 --> 01:58:17.134
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2845
01:58:17.470 --> 01:58:18.910
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He still thinks she's looking through a</v>

2846
01:58:18.911 --> 01:58:21.640
<v Speaker 3>camera right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He probably is some of the dimension.</v>

2847
01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:23.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like what happened?</v>

2848
01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:24.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's gone.</v>

2849
01:58:24.370 --> 01:58:25.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2850
01:58:25.631 --> 01:58:29.020
<v Speaker 3>That had to be lights out and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to the grizzly bear hunting thing.</v>

2851
01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:30.490
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the unfortunate thing,</v>

2852
01:58:30.491 --> 01:58:32.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all those people that closed down</v>

2853
01:58:32.111 --> 01:58:34.210
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never even,</v>

2854
01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:35.710
<v Speaker 3>they all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

2855
01:58:35.740 --> 01:58:40.740
<v Speaker 3>I would venture a guess that anyone that</v>
<v Speaker 3>voted on that ballot has never seen a</v>

2856
01:58:41.200 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 3>bear or Bennett</v>

2857
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:45.820
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bear territory or participated</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all in understanding how that</v>

2858
01:58:45.821 --> 01:58:49.240
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem works isn't in a very small</v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of people.</v>

2859
01:58:49.241 --> 01:58:53.710
<v Speaker 1>It was a very small number of people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got the information from an email</v>

2860
01:58:53.711 --> 01:58:54.620
<v Speaker 1>list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2861
01:58:54.730 --> 01:58:58.180
<v Speaker 1>I think the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was less than 3000 people.</v>

2862
01:58:58.240 --> 01:58:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something really crazy.</v>

2863
01:58:59.801 --> 01:59:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Which heil of misinformation and a and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rumor.</v>

2864
01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also if you talk to the actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildlife biologists and maybe even more</v>

2865
01:59:07.481 --> 01:59:10.210
<v Speaker 1>importantly the people that are in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>field on a daily basis,</v>

2866
01:59:10.211 --> 01:59:13.240
<v Speaker 1>like there is no pop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem with the grizzly bear</v>

2867
01:59:13.241 --> 01:59:15.070
<v Speaker 1>population in British Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2868
01:59:15.071 --> 01:59:20.071
<v Speaker 1>it's thriving and it's a giant animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>that eats a lot of meat and it's out</v>

2869
01:59:20.681 --> 01:59:22.960
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken out a lot of calves right now as</v>

2870
01:59:22.961 --> 01:59:24.610
<v Speaker 1>we speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now that they can't hunt them,</v>

2871
01:59:25.090 --> 01:59:28.060
<v Speaker 1>they're very likely to have a situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're going to have to hire</v>

2872
01:59:28.061 --> 01:59:29.650
<v Speaker 1>people to shoot problem bears.</v>

2873
01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first eco tour that goes down where</v>

2874
01:59:33.431 --> 01:59:38.431
<v Speaker 1>a a boat full or a bus full or a hiking</v>
<v Speaker 1>group watches a boar kill and eat</v>

2875
01:59:40.061 --> 01:59:43.600
<v Speaker 1>triplets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill and eat three football or</v>

2876
01:59:43.601 --> 01:59:46.960
<v Speaker 1>watermelon sized cubs and rip them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shreds and eat them while they're</v>

2877
01:59:46.961 --> 01:59:50.140
<v Speaker 1>bawling and trying to get to their mom</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then have him killed her mom.</v>

2878
01:59:50.570 --> 01:59:52.420
<v Speaker 1>Once that goes down and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2879
01:59:52.421 --> 01:59:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I think we might have a couple too many</v>
<v Speaker 1>barriers here,</v>

2880
01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:56.830
<v Speaker 1>so now we're again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that happens every day even in a</v>

2881
01:59:56.831 --> 01:59:58.990
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everyday but it happens often even</v>

2882
01:59:58.991 --> 02:00:02.920
<v Speaker 1>in a good population but now that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've shut down any killing</v>

2883
02:00:02.921 --> 02:00:05.140
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things have no predators other</v>

2884
02:00:05.141 --> 02:00:07.990
<v Speaker 1>from old bores that become giant bullies</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the block.</v>

2885
02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to do about that?</v>

2886
02:00:09.641 --> 02:00:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Because apparently there is some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a movement to try to educate people and</v>

2887
02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:17.890
<v Speaker 1>get them to understand what they've done</v>
<v Speaker 1>by making this hunt illegal.</v>

2888
02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:23.260
<v Speaker 1>But what I would like to see is people</v>
<v Speaker 1>also be educated on the fact like what</v>

2889
02:00:23.261 --> 02:00:26.050
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these animals are actually edible</v>

2890
02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:28.990
<v Speaker 1>and that instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the part of the problem is the</v>

2891
02:00:28.991 --> 02:00:31.900
<v Speaker 1>fact that these people are just taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head in the hide and leaving behind</v>

2892
02:00:31.901 --> 02:00:35.050
<v Speaker 1>the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you were responsible for not just</v>

2893
02:00:35.470 --> 02:00:39.430
<v Speaker 1>taking the meat but showing that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>consuming it and then teaching these</v>

2894
02:00:39.431 --> 02:00:41.950
<v Speaker 1>people how to cook it and then how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>prepare it and,</v>

2895
02:00:42.150 --> 02:00:47.150
<v Speaker 1>and make them realize like you should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>using this thing is in its entirety as a</v>

2896
02:00:47.531 --> 02:00:50.230
<v Speaker 1>resource.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And don't just think about it as this</v>

2897
02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:53.170
<v Speaker 1>fucking rug or this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2898
02:00:53.171 --> 02:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>skull that you're going to have on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>wall.</v>

2899
02:00:54.850 --> 02:00:56.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the problem.</v>

2900
02:00:56.771 --> 02:00:58.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's the problem because</v>

2901
02:00:58.511 --> 02:00:59.620
<v Speaker 1>if people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people,</v>

2902
02:00:59.621 --> 02:01:02.050
<v Speaker 1>and some people do think this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get letters like this all the time</v>

2903
02:01:02.051 --> 02:01:03.370
<v Speaker 1>where people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me get this straight.</v>

2904
02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:06.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it always happens after we posted a</v>

2905
02:01:06.971 --> 02:01:08.860
<v Speaker 1>picture of me with an animal in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>backpack,</v>

2906
02:01:09.730 --> 02:01:10.690
<v Speaker 1>elk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antlers or whatever.</v>

2907
02:01:10.691 --> 02:01:11.770
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yup,</v>

2908
02:01:11.890 --> 02:01:13.960
<v Speaker 1>I can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how many meet in that backpack?</v>

2909
02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:15.220
<v Speaker 1>And I tell him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2910
02:01:15.250 --> 02:01:19.090
<v Speaker 1>my first four backpack loads were meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking the head out last.</v>

2911
02:01:19.091 --> 02:01:21.250
<v Speaker 1>That's how we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The head goes out last because it's the</v>

2912
02:01:21.251 --> 02:01:22.930
<v Speaker 1>least of importance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It holds the,</v>

2913
02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:26.080
<v Speaker 1>the least importance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the hide in the head go out last.</v>

2914
02:01:26.081 --> 02:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>So if you take a picture of a backpack</v>
<v Speaker 1>full of meat,</v>

2915
02:01:29.651 --> 02:01:32.560
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a backpack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause the meats inside.</v>

2916
02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:34.240
<v Speaker 1>So it looks like you're wearing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>backpack.</v>

2917
02:01:34.241 --> 02:01:38.680
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we purposefully did one last year in</v>

2918
02:01:38.681 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see</v>

2919
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:43.200
<v Speaker 3>the elks hooves sticking out of the top</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the backpack.</v>

2920
02:01:43.201 --> 02:01:46.220
<v Speaker 3>So people realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are moving quarters and we publish</v>

2921
02:01:46.221 --> 02:01:48.560
<v Speaker 3>these photos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so people will Ryan and say,</v>

2922
02:01:48.561 --> 02:01:49.490
<v Speaker 3>seat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me get this straight.</v>

2923
02:01:49.491 --> 02:01:51.080
<v Speaker 3>You kill the deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take its life,</v>

2924
02:01:51.530 --> 02:01:53.600
<v Speaker 3>you take it's hide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he'd take his antlers and you just</v>

2925
02:01:53.601 --> 02:01:56.240
<v Speaker 3>take it home in mountain and you leave</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else to rot and said,</v>

2926
02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:56.491
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2927
02:01:56.491 --> 02:01:57.740
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it says that it's,</v>

2928
02:01:57.820 --> 02:01:58.730
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're ignorant.</v>

2929
02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:01.340
<v Speaker 3>They're not paying any attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well the there whatsoever.</v>

2930
02:02:01.370 --> 02:02:03.690
<v Speaker 3>That's willful ignorance because you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could find that out in,</v>

2931
02:02:03.691 --> 02:02:06.620
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone knows that deer's delicious</v>

2932
02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:09.680
<v Speaker 3>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>venison and elk in particular.</v>

2933
02:02:09.710 --> 02:02:13.490
<v Speaker 3>It's delicious meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that you would even consider</v>

2934
02:02:13.491 --> 02:02:15.110
<v Speaker 3>leaving that behind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

2935
02:02:15.111 --> 02:02:17.300
<v Speaker 3>Nobody does that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard of anybody doing that.</v>

2936
02:02:17.301 --> 02:02:20.570
<v Speaker 3>I know I've heard of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've heard a lot of fear in elk.</v>

2937
02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:21.321
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in,</v>

2938
02:02:21.321 --> 02:02:22.550
<v Speaker 3>not in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not in reality.</v>

2939
02:02:22.551 --> 02:02:23.720
<v Speaker 3>I've just heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2940
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:25.400
<v Speaker 3>I've heard people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

2941
02:02:25.401 --> 02:02:28.160
<v Speaker 3>it's what they used to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what they did and you know,</v>

2942
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:31.120
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even imagine that as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>scenario in,</v>

2943
02:02:31.170 --> 02:02:32.540
<v Speaker 3>in today's Day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2944
02:02:32.860 --> 02:02:36.560
<v Speaker 3>the meat is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had people at my house before,</v>

2945
02:02:36.561 --> 02:02:38.360
<v Speaker 3>they've never eaten elk and I've cooked</v>
<v Speaker 3>it for him.</v>

2946
02:02:38.361 --> 02:02:39.830
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

2947
02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:43.040
<v Speaker 3>Because it has a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a feeling you get from eating it</v>

2948
02:02:43.041 --> 02:02:45.020
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It almost like his energy in it.</v>

2949
02:02:45.290 --> 02:02:46.910
<v Speaker 3>I get charges you up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2950
02:02:46.970 --> 02:02:49.520
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a potent protein and so</v>

2951
02:02:49.521 --> 02:02:52.480
<v Speaker 3>delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said that with leave that behind me.</v>

2952
02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:54.140
<v Speaker 3>That should be a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2953
02:02:54.141 --> 02:02:54.701
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2954
02:02:54.701 --> 02:02:55.580
<v Speaker 3>I if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2955
02:02:55.730 --> 02:02:57.500
<v Speaker 3>if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it go the other way.</v>

2956
02:02:57.530 --> 02:03:01.100
<v Speaker 3>I've seen hunters argue over their</v>
<v Speaker 3>share,</v>

2957
02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:02.690
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're sharing an elk with a</v>

2958
02:03:02.691 --> 02:03:04.370
<v Speaker 3>friend or you went on a hunt and one you</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill.</v>

2959
02:03:04.370 --> 02:03:05.031
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>well how much do I get?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2961
02:03:06.610 --> 02:03:08.390
<v Speaker 3>I've seen guys argue over that more than</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

2962
02:03:08.391 --> 02:03:10.580
<v Speaker 3>And I sent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sent elk meat to a,</v>

2963

<v Speaker 3>the writer of men's health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>up killing the elk two days after he</v>

2965
02:03:15.951 --> 02:03:17.450
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had to go on another story and I</v>

<v Speaker 3>Cause I feel like I was really a part of</v>

2969
02:03:21.831 --> 02:03:23.900
<v Speaker 3>this hunt and I did so.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean he wrote about in the article but</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in the last paragraph forever.</v>

2972
02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:31.100
<v Speaker 3>But he sent me a text message and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

2973
02:03:31.101 --> 02:03:33.560
<v Speaker 3>are you freaking kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the funniest thing I've ever</v>

2974
02:03:33.561 --> 02:03:34.800
<v Speaker 3>eaten in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

2975
02:03:34.801 --> 02:03:37.970
<v Speaker 3>it's prepared correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to learn how to do that</v>

2976
02:03:37.980 --> 02:03:38.813
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

2977
02:03:38.910 --> 02:03:39.561
<v Speaker 3>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2978
02:03:39.561 --> 02:03:41.270
<v Speaker 3>he's seared everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talked to us and we told you,</v>

2979
02:03:41.271 --> 02:03:43.430
<v Speaker 3>you want to keep it like really medium</v>
<v Speaker 3>rare and just,</v>

2980
02:03:44.530 --> 02:03:45.650
<v Speaker 3>he just loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He loved it.</v>

2981
02:03:45.651 --> 02:03:46.341
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

2982
02:03:46.341 --> 02:03:50.270
<v Speaker 3>and he talked about like all those days</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he hiked with us in the mountains,</v>

2983
02:03:51.110 --> 02:03:52.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he remarked that he could taste that in</v>

2984
02:03:52.881 --> 02:03:53.780
<v Speaker 3>the flesh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2985
02:03:53.810 --> 02:03:57.320
<v Speaker 3>He felt that he felt that connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now he's like big time wants to,</v>

2986
02:03:57.650 --> 02:03:59.930
<v Speaker 3>wants to start hunting first food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2987
02:03:59.931 --> 02:04:03.170
<v Speaker 3>I always tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you really want to start hunting,</v>

2988
02:04:03.171 --> 02:04:07.430
<v Speaker 3>you really want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so difficult to get started.</v>

2989
02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:12.520
<v Speaker 3>It's so difficult to even find the</v>
<v Speaker 3>resources to take the first steps.</v>

2990
02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:15.440
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people that say,</v>

2991
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:16.610
<v Speaker 3>I want to bow hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2992
02:04:16.611 --> 02:04:19.130
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

2993
02:04:19.131 --> 02:04:21.740
<v Speaker 3>you need to learn how to shoot a bow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And second of all,</v>

2994
02:04:22.130 --> 02:04:25.850
<v Speaker 3>by saying that you want to bow hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you're saying to me is I want to</v>

2995
02:04:25.851 --> 02:04:30.800
<v Speaker 3>practice 300 days a year with my bow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to really learn archery.</v>

2996
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:34.520
<v Speaker 3>I want to learn the proper form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to learn mental control.</v>

2997
02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:38.430
<v Speaker 3>I want to learn the ability to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to keep your mind</v>

2998
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:39.601
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2999
02:04:39.601 --> 02:04:44.220
<v Speaker 1>in the moment while you're under extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety and facing an animal,</v>

3000
02:04:44.221 --> 02:04:47.700
<v Speaker 1>to understand how to range an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to,</v>

3001
02:04:47.850 --> 02:04:50.940
<v Speaker 1>what's the proper yardage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the proper shot placement?</v>

3002
02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:54.210
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about a lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about literally changing</v>

3003
02:04:54.211 --> 02:04:55.890
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not,</v>

3004
02:04:55.920 --> 02:05:00.330
<v Speaker 1>don't say I want to go bow hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I want to go deep sea fishing on a</v>

3005
02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:02.820
<v Speaker 1>charter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put the fee,</v>

3006
02:05:02.850 --> 02:05:04.860
<v Speaker 1>the bait on the hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop it in,</v>

3007
02:05:04.861 --> 02:05:06.630
<v Speaker 1>and I just really the the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fish,</v>

3008
02:05:07.020 --> 02:05:08.460
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>

3009
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's saying I want to go bow hunting.</v>

3010
02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3011
02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:13.380
<v Speaker 1>they see you do it and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3012
02:05:13.381 --> 02:05:14.430
<v Speaker 1>you bow hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3013
02:05:15.090 --> 02:05:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm crazy and I've been obsessed</v>

3014
02:05:17.461 --> 02:05:21.120
<v Speaker 1>with this shit for years and I practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day and you go to my backyard,</v>

3015
02:05:21.150 --> 02:05:25.110
<v Speaker 1>I've got fucking rubber elk sitting on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hillside and I shoot at him every day</v>

3016
02:05:25.111 --> 02:05:26.040
<v Speaker 1>before I do anything.</v>

3017
02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:28.230
<v Speaker 1>So how much do you want to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3018
02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:31.230
<v Speaker 1>How much do you really want to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you first have to come on</v>

3019
02:05:31.231 --> 02:05:32.310
<v Speaker 1>archer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3020
02:05:32.311 --> 02:05:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to learn something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and now you have to actually get</v>

3021
02:05:36.931 --> 02:05:40.920
<v Speaker 1>out of your truck and take a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>steps into the Wilderness and hope you</v>

3022
02:05:40.921 --> 02:05:45.230
<v Speaker 1>can even just get back to your truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let alone finding an animal,</v>

3023
02:05:45.231 --> 02:05:48.060
<v Speaker 1>illegal animal sneaking into within</v>
<v Speaker 1>archery range,</v>

3024
02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:51.330
<v Speaker 1>killing him quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dismembering them,</v>

3025
02:05:51.331 --> 02:05:52.150
<v Speaker 1>getting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3026
02:05:52.150 --> 02:05:55.110
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that freaked me out when</v>

3027
02:05:55.111 --> 02:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I first went hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in shape as far as like Jujitsu,</v>

3028
02:05:59.080 --> 02:05:59.811
<v Speaker 1>martial art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shay,</v>

3029
02:05:59.811 --> 02:06:04.811
<v Speaker 1>but fucking hiking with a backpack on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and altitude and you're going up and</v>

3030
02:06:05.431 --> 02:06:08.010
<v Speaker 1>down and up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an hours a day like,</v>

3031
02:06:08.070 --> 02:06:08.791
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3032
02:06:08.791 --> 02:06:10.710
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be conditioned for this shit.</v>

3033
02:06:10.710 --> 02:06:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3034
02:06:11.850 --> 02:06:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I think if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3035
02:06:13.290 --> 02:06:18.120
<v Speaker 1>I think the way to do it if somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>really wants to is really wild pigs,</v>

3036
02:06:18.630 --> 02:06:22.440
<v Speaker 1>wild pigs with a gun is probably the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first way you should do it because I</v>

3037
02:06:22.441 --> 02:06:24.750
<v Speaker 1>think first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be done.</v>

3038
02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:26.740
<v Speaker 1>This is something that's imperative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

3039
02:06:26.741 --> 02:06:28.230
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about can't be done</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

3040
02:06:28.270 --> 02:06:29.400
<v Speaker 1>It can't be done enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

3041
02:06:29.401 --> 02:06:33.450
<v Speaker 1>you could go no wild pigs starting now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would be a great,</v>

3042
02:06:33.690 --> 02:06:36.180
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a great service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a great service except for</v>

3043
02:06:36.181 --> 02:06:39.540
<v Speaker 1>people enjoy wild pig meat and hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's awesome.</v>

3044
02:06:39.720 --> 02:06:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's an awesome way to get</v>

3045
02:06:41.461 --> 02:06:43.500
<v Speaker 1>started too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go wild pig hunting,</v>

3046
02:06:43.530 --> 02:06:46.260
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing good for the environment.</v>

3047
02:06:46.261 --> 02:06:50.130
<v Speaker 1>This is an invasive species that</v>
<v Speaker 1>devastates ground nesting birds,</v>

3048
02:06:50.131 --> 02:06:53.610
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of plant species and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're dealing with agriculture</v>

3049
02:06:53.640 --> 02:06:55.320
<v Speaker 1>like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean then it's really,</v>

3050
02:06:55.321 --> 02:06:58.080
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a massive financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>burden on farmers,</v>

3051
02:06:58.530 --> 02:07:00.510
<v Speaker 1>but with a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way to do it because the</v>

3052
02:07:00.511 --> 02:07:02.850
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much easier if you have a rifle</v>

3053
02:07:02.851 --> 02:07:05.460
<v Speaker 1>rest and someone can take you to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>range.</v>

3054
02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:08.880
<v Speaker 1>The learning curve is so much shorter</v>
<v Speaker 1>than when the bow.</v>

3055
02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

3056
02:07:10.110 --> 02:07:12.390
<v Speaker 1>100% and that's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great first animal.</v>

3057
02:07:12.391 --> 02:07:13.950
<v Speaker 1>The only other thing that I would maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>say if,</v>

3058
02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:18.870
<v Speaker 1>if somebody could share with you is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>share a duck blind or something along</v>

3059
02:07:18.871 --> 02:07:21.330
<v Speaker 1>those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because sometimes it's difficult to wrap</v>

3060
02:07:21.331 --> 02:07:23.400
<v Speaker 1>your head around killing a large animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

3061
02:07:23.401 --> 02:07:25.830
<v Speaker 1>It might help to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As odd as that sounds,</v>

3062
02:07:25.831 --> 02:07:28.770
<v Speaker 1>we're more comfortable with killing</v>
<v Speaker 1>pheasants or grouse or docs or something</v>

3063
02:07:28.771 --> 02:07:29.604
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3064
02:07:29.670 --> 02:07:33.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also a very tricky shot.</v>

3065
02:07:33.300 --> 02:07:34.290
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3066
02:07:34.291 --> 02:07:37.360
<v Speaker 1>and there's safety there because a</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of people have guns and not</v>

3067
02:07:37.361 --> 02:07:38.820
<v Speaker 1>everyone's paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3068
02:07:38.880 --> 02:07:39.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3069
02:07:39.910 --> 02:07:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you been the one?</v>

3070
02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:42.640
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

3071
02:07:43.180 --> 02:07:44.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3072
02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:48.400
<v Speaker 1>I've done it two years in a row now</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we hunt axis deer in Lanai and</v>

3073
02:07:48.401 --> 02:07:50.860
<v Speaker 1>it's another one of those things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be done.</v>

3074
02:07:51.190 --> 02:07:56.190
<v Speaker 1>There's something around 3000 people on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the island and more than 20,000 access</v>

3075
02:07:58.991 --> 02:08:01.960
<v Speaker 1>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very small island and it's</v>

3076
02:08:02.140 --> 02:08:04.210
<v Speaker 1>fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3077
02:08:04.211 --> 02:08:06.700
<v Speaker 1>we were coming home from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3078
02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:09.760
<v Speaker 1>w w we got super lucky on the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

3079
02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:13.000
<v Speaker 1>the first night a hunting we got out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truck.</v>

3080
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:18.030
<v Speaker 1>We set up a target to see if the bows</v>
<v Speaker 1>were in tune shot one arrow at a target</v>

3081
02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:21.820
<v Speaker 1>and a Alec.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy that I was with went,</v>

3082
02:08:21.850 --> 02:08:24.190
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a buck about 200 yards.</v>

3083
02:08:24.191 --> 02:08:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Look right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're like,</v>

3084
02:08:25.481 --> 02:08:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kicked off our shoes,</v>

3085
02:08:28.330 --> 02:08:30.850
<v Speaker 1>stocked in on him and I killed them</v>
<v Speaker 1>within 15 minutes,</v>

3086
02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:34.630
<v Speaker 1>which is nuts because what the next four</v>
<v Speaker 1>days without killing anything,</v>

3087
02:08:34.631 --> 02:08:36.220
<v Speaker 1>and I finally got another one on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last day,</v>

3088
02:08:36.670 --> 02:08:39.790
<v Speaker 1>but you can shoot as many as 12 day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they want to get rid of all of</v>

3089
02:08:39.791 --> 02:08:42.040
<v Speaker 1>course eating themselves up a house in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

3090
02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3091
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:45.160
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The numbers,</v>

3092
02:08:45.161 --> 02:08:48.070
<v Speaker 1>the numbers are crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also crazy how tuned in these</v>

3093
02:08:48.071 --> 02:08:50.940
<v Speaker 1>things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they evolved to escape tigers.</v>

3094
02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:52.221
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

3095
02:08:52.221 --> 02:08:55.630
<v Speaker 1>they're from India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are fucking switched on.</v>

3096
02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:59.320
<v Speaker 1>They're like a whitetail deer on</v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids and meth.</v>

3097
02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

3098
02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:00.760
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>

3099
02:09:00.760 --> 02:09:03.610
<v Speaker 1>What's up your own?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're gone and they're so fast.</v>

3100
02:09:03.611 --> 02:09:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen an animal so fast.</v>

3101
02:09:05.800 --> 02:09:06.820
<v Speaker 1>So wicked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3102
02:09:06.821 --> 02:09:09.550
<v Speaker 1>But it's a good argument for hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3103
02:09:09.551 --> 02:09:10.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>

3104
02:09:10.090 --> 02:09:13.480
<v Speaker 1>here's the situation where the animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>are out there,</v>

3105
02:09:13.481 --> 02:09:17.200
<v Speaker 1>the population is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no balance of life here.</v>

3106
02:09:17.201 --> 02:09:19.870
<v Speaker 1>This is not like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no balance here.</v>

3107
02:09:19.871 --> 02:09:23.740
<v Speaker 1>This is completely out of balance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that they hire snipers.</v>

3108
02:09:23.890 --> 02:09:25.270
<v Speaker 1>I was just going to shake them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3109
02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:28.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming they hiring guns to come in</v>
<v Speaker 1>at night and shoot them a night.</v>

3110
02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Scopes are exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what,</v>

3111
02:09:30.161 --> 02:09:32.980
<v Speaker 1>just to keep it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to keep it somewhat in check.</v>

3112
02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:37.480
<v Speaker 1>But unless you want to let wolves loose</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this island and you know,</v>

3113
02:09:37.481 --> 02:09:39.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how else you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix that.</v>

3114
02:09:39.220 --> 02:09:41.830
<v Speaker 1>You want to put tigers there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really supposed to be</v>

3115
02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:44.410
<v Speaker 1>catching them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually studied tigers right out of</v>

3116
02:09:44.411 --> 02:09:47.920
<v Speaker 1>college in Bangladesh and Nepal and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would see,</v>

3117
02:09:47.930 --> 02:09:50.920
<v Speaker 1>I would see access deer there and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

3118
02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:52.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean the jungle there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was real.</v>

3119
02:09:52.690 --> 02:09:54.340
<v Speaker 1>So like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why they're looking at</v>

3120
02:09:54.341 --> 02:09:55.061
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3121
02:09:55.061 --> 02:09:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Because you look at a tiger and a zoo</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

3122
02:09:56.891 --> 02:10:01.240
<v Speaker 1>there's no way that thing can hide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you go to the jungle and</v>

3123
02:10:01.241 --> 02:10:05.290
<v Speaker 1>everything is green.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except for all the palms that die turned</v>

3124
02:10:05.291 --> 02:10:08.680
<v Speaker 1>bright orange and they all have really</v>
<v Speaker 1>long sharp,</v>

3125
02:10:09.090 --> 02:10:11.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frons that look like a tiger stripes.</v>

3126
02:10:11.701 --> 02:10:16.701
<v Speaker 1>He sees little blotches of orange and</v>
<v Speaker 1>black all disappearing into the green</v>

3127
02:10:17.291 --> 02:10:20.500
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we would see the deer and the deer</v>

3128
02:10:20.501 --> 02:10:22.440
<v Speaker 1>would know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when we were going into an area to,</v>

3129
02:10:22.490 --> 02:10:24.790
<v Speaker 1>to either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a cat that was radio collared,</v>

3130
02:10:24.791 --> 02:10:27.730
<v Speaker 1>are going in to look at a particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of habitat.</v>

3131
02:10:28.090 --> 02:10:30.550
<v Speaker 1>The deer were just like on pins and</v>
<v Speaker 1>needles.</v>

3132
02:10:30.551 --> 02:10:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Like we'd get him remotely close and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could see him.</v>

3133
02:10:32.441 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 1>We're dealing a lot with islands and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd</v>

3134
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:35.810
<v Speaker 3>see him leaving the island on the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>

3135
02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:37.670
<v Speaker 3>like they'd be ditching the swim to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>next island.</v>

3136
02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:39.260
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very aware.</v>

3137
02:10:39.261 --> 02:10:42.740
<v Speaker 3>They're extremely aware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How crazy is it that somehow or another</v>

3138
02:10:42.741 --> 02:10:47.741
<v Speaker 3>the tiger evolve to develop those</v>
<v Speaker 3>stripes that looked like the colors in</v>

3139
02:10:47.841 --> 02:10:50.450
<v Speaker 3>nature?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is the mechanism?</v>

3140
02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:52.520
<v Speaker 3>Phenotypical representation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3141
02:10:52.521 --> 02:10:53.870
<v Speaker 3>He's all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is from,</v>

3142
02:10:54.020 --> 02:10:55.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where this picture was</v>
<v Speaker 3>taken,</v>

3143
02:10:55.101 --> 02:10:59.390
<v Speaker 3>but this reminds me of like in Nepal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>southern Nepal where I was the Royal</v>

3144
02:10:59.390 --> 02:11:01.490
<v Speaker 3>Chitwan National Forest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had this grass that grows like 20</v>

3145
02:11:01.491 --> 02:11:03.650
<v Speaker 3>feet tall and I mean just absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 3>disappear.</v>

3146
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:08.060
<v Speaker 3>But how bizarre is it that this animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another evolve this</v>

3147
02:11:08.061 --> 02:11:09.260
<v Speaker 3>camouflage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3148
02:11:09.530 --> 02:11:13.040
<v Speaker 3>It's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So strange that that's what's so</v>

3149
02:11:13.041 --> 02:11:13.810
<v Speaker 3>amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3150
02:11:13.810 --> 02:11:16.260
<v Speaker 3>so the evolution of it and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3151
02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:19.070
<v Speaker 3>this idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of phenotypical their physical</v>

3152
02:11:19.071 --> 02:11:22.010
<v Speaker 3>representation that their genetics is</v>
<v Speaker 3>just so fantastic.</v>

3153
02:11:22.130 --> 02:11:24.650
<v Speaker 3>What did you study in college while</v>
<v Speaker 3>biology?</v>

3154
02:11:25.250 --> 02:11:26.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause I wanted to,</v>

3155
02:11:27.460 --> 02:11:29.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I got started doing,</v>

3156
02:11:29.260 --> 02:11:30.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting and things like that,</v>

3157
02:11:30.351 --> 02:11:32.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't come from a hunting family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just,</v>

3158
02:11:32.350 --> 02:11:33.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when did you start hunting?</v>

3159
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:36.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as soon as I could,</v>

3160
02:11:36.381 --> 02:11:38.390
<v Speaker 3>like when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3161
02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:39.111
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>11,</v>

3162
02:11:39.111 --> 02:11:41.570
<v Speaker 3>12,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would force my dad.</v>

3163
02:11:41.890 --> 02:11:42.511
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a,</v>

3164
02:11:42.511 --> 02:11:45.950
<v Speaker 3>he had a couple of guns cause he just</v>
<v Speaker 3>had guns and he was a kid and he would,</v>

3165
02:11:45.951 --> 02:11:50.940
<v Speaker 3>he would go up and he'd go like deer</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting once a year with a buddy of his</v>

3166
02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:51.840
<v Speaker 3>in Maine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3167
02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:53.880
<v Speaker 3>I think they just drank beer and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>think that he,</v>

3168
02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:54.740
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he never killed a deer.</v>

3169
02:11:54.741 --> 02:11:57.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they ever even deer on and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just literally drive up getting a</v>

3170
02:11:57.501 --> 02:12:00.320
<v Speaker 3>cabin and their bodies and get hammered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get hammered.</v>

3171
02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:02.120
<v Speaker 3>I think that was probably gay scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3172
02:12:02.121 --> 02:12:04.070
<v Speaker 3>That's like when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was in high school,</v>

3173
02:12:04.071 --> 02:12:05.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my friends from high school,</v>

3174
02:12:05.841 --> 02:12:07.130
<v Speaker 3>he did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

3175
02:12:07.131 --> 02:12:07.880
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3176
02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:09.140
<v Speaker 3>his family would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3177
02:12:09.170 --> 02:12:11.870
<v Speaker 3>go deer hunting and his dad literally</v>
<v Speaker 3>never killed a deer.</v>

3178
02:12:12.260 --> 02:12:13.820
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the dumbest Shit I've ever heard</v>

3179
02:12:13.821 --> 02:12:16.400
<v Speaker 3>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your Dad spends all this time hunting in</v>

3180
02:12:16.401 --> 02:12:18.380
<v Speaker 3>the woods is never killed a d not</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting.</v>

3181
02:12:18.580 --> 02:12:20.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>David Able David.</v>

3182
02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:21.830
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

3183
02:12:21.831 --> 02:12:22.361
<v Speaker 3>so my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

3184
02:12:22.361 --> 02:12:24.550
<v Speaker 3>my dad is a gift to me was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3185
02:12:24.590 --> 02:12:27.830
<v Speaker 3>my grandparents got him a subscription,</v>
<v Speaker 3>outdoor life books.</v>

3186
02:12:28.190 --> 02:12:32.360
<v Speaker 3>So He'd get all these at all of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>books that were painted by these gifted</v>

3187
02:12:32.450 --> 02:12:34.670
<v Speaker 3>authors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of them was named Jack O'Connor,</v>

3188
02:12:34.671 --> 02:12:37.310
<v Speaker 3>who's inspired my entire career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'd read all these things and,</v>

3189
02:12:38.090 --> 02:12:39.950
<v Speaker 3>and so I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to spend time outside,</v>

3190
02:12:39.951 --> 02:12:43.520
<v Speaker 3>so might as well get a wildlife biology</v>
<v Speaker 3>degree and then do research and live</v>

3191
02:12:43.521 --> 02:12:44.580
<v Speaker 3>outside and things like that.</v>

3192
02:12:44.580 --> 02:12:47.120
<v Speaker 3>And it was odd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As odd as it was when I was in college,</v>

3193
02:12:47.121 --> 02:12:51.110
<v Speaker 3>I was still hunting a lot and I had</v>
<v Speaker 3>family and friends sent me down and</v>

3194
02:12:51.111 --> 02:12:51.831
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

3195
02:12:51.831 --> 02:12:53.660
<v Speaker 3>you got to like buckle down on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies.</v>

3196
02:12:53.661 --> 02:12:55.280
<v Speaker 3>And I wasn't disagreeing with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're like,</v>

3197
02:12:55.281 --> 02:12:58.250
<v Speaker 3>you need to stop hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop hunting so much.</v>

3198
02:12:58.670 --> 02:13:01.220
<v Speaker 3>And because I'd literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd go to the Arctic Caribou hunting by</v>

3199
02:13:01.221 --> 02:13:04.460
<v Speaker 3>myself and I'd come home and go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>classes and then I'd leave to go to</v>

3200
02:13:04.461 --> 02:13:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Alaska on a black bear hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd come home and go to classes and I've</v>

3201
02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:09.260
<v Speaker 3>just save as much money as I could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't party,</v>

3202
02:13:09.261 --> 02:13:10.700
<v Speaker 3>didn't drink with any of my body's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>

3203
02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:13.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't do anything lavish.</v>

3204
02:13:13.521 --> 02:13:15.650
<v Speaker 3>I just literally kept going on trips and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3205
02:13:15.651 --> 02:13:18.470
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of basically what's led to my</v>
<v Speaker 3>career today.</v>

3206
02:13:18.530 --> 02:13:20.300
<v Speaker 3>But it was funny that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3207
02:13:20.301 --> 02:13:21.890
<v Speaker 3>these kinds of things traveled in</v>
<v Speaker 3>parallel,</v>

3208
02:13:21.891 --> 02:13:22.430
<v Speaker 3>if you will.</v>

3209
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:24.860
<v Speaker 3>When did you start making films and when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did it,</v>

3210
02:13:24.890 --> 02:13:29.360
<v Speaker 3>did you make them with the intention of</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to relay like what I was</v>

3211
02:13:29.361 --> 02:13:33.070
<v Speaker 3>explaining at the beginning of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast that what you do best as you,</v>

3212
02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:38.120
<v Speaker 3>you as much as possible in an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're relaying the whole experience as</v>

3213
02:13:38.881 --> 02:13:43.770
<v Speaker 3>opposed to what you're going to get when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see a hunting television show or</v>

3214
02:13:43.771 --> 02:13:45.480
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially what you're going to get when</v>

3215
02:13:45.481 --> 02:13:47.860
<v Speaker 3>you see honey in a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

3216
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:51.600
<v Speaker 3>we started in 2012 and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had some guys that approached me to</v>

3217
02:13:51.601 --> 02:13:54.740
<v Speaker 3>host a hunting TV show and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>

3218
02:13:56.340 --> 02:13:57.600
<v Speaker 3>what's that going to look like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

3219
02:13:57.601 --> 02:13:58.950
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll pay for your trips.</v>

3220
02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll get all your sponsors and stuff</v>

3221
02:14:01.171 --> 02:14:02.760
<v Speaker 3>lined up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll be fully sponsored.</v>

3222
02:14:02.761 --> 02:14:04.530
<v Speaker 3>We'll split the sponsor dollars with</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3223
02:14:04.531 --> 02:14:06.090
<v Speaker 3>We'll buy your air time x,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Y,</v>

3224
02:14:06.091 --> 02:14:06.330
<v Speaker 3>and z.</v>

3225
02:14:06.330 --> 02:14:08.760
<v Speaker 3>These guys were pretty wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3226
02:14:08.761 --> 02:14:11.400
<v Speaker 3>this sounds like the absolute dream to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

3227
02:14:11.720 --> 02:14:12.630
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I said,</v>

3228
02:14:12.631 --> 02:14:15.510
<v Speaker 3>I want to control how it's filmed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we go,</v>

3229
02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:18.960
<v Speaker 3>how we hunt and the gear that I use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they said 100%.</v>

3230
02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:21.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very quickly within like the first eight</v>

3231
02:14:21.691 --> 02:14:23.730
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things started to go out the</v>

3232
02:14:23.731 --> 02:14:24.840
<v Speaker 3>window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

3233
02:14:24.841 --> 02:14:27.510
<v Speaker 3>we want you to go here and hunt with</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy because he's super popular and</v>

3234
02:14:27.511 --> 02:14:29.590
<v Speaker 3>we want you to kill this animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want you to wear this clothing.</v>

3235
02:14:29.591 --> 02:14:30.151
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3236
02:14:30.151 --> 02:14:32.700
<v Speaker 3>I never do any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing any of this.</v>

3237
02:14:33.210 --> 02:14:33.940
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

3238
02:14:33.940 --> 02:14:35.430
<v Speaker 3>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate the opportunity but I'm</v>

3239
02:14:35.431 --> 02:14:37.980
<v Speaker 3>going to walk away from this Gig.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I walked away from it.</v>

3240
02:14:38.610 --> 02:14:40.020
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then I met,</v>

3241
02:14:40.021 --> 02:14:43.380
<v Speaker 3>ended up meeting up with kyle of whom</v>
<v Speaker 3>you met earlier is in your green room</v>

3242
02:14:43.381 --> 02:14:43.830
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

3243
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:46.440
<v Speaker 3>And then another guy named William</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oltman,</v>

3244
02:14:46.441 --> 02:14:48.840
<v Speaker 3>who's our director of photography now at</v>
<v Speaker 3>CIC Manta.</v>

3245
02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:52.260
<v Speaker 3>And I met up with these guys and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and through a series of weird</v>

3246
02:14:52.261 --> 02:14:55.160
<v Speaker 3>circumstances we ended up filming</v>
<v Speaker 3>together and we,</v>

3247
02:14:55.170 --> 02:14:57.030
<v Speaker 3>when we just started kind of going on</v>
<v Speaker 3>trips,</v>

3248
02:14:57.031 --> 02:15:01.560
<v Speaker 3>but when we started going on trips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our intention was never to do a TV show.</v>

3249
02:15:01.590 --> 02:15:06.590
<v Speaker 3>Our intention was how can we tell a</v>
<v Speaker 3>story about what we're doing?</v>

3250
02:15:06.811 --> 02:15:10.500
<v Speaker 3>Because really what we're doing ends up</v>
<v Speaker 3>at having a really fantastic tale.</v>

3251
02:15:10.501 --> 02:15:13.320
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be a huge tail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be moby Dick,</v>

3252
02:15:13.650 --> 02:15:15.870
<v Speaker 3>but there's a story whenever you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on these hunts.</v>

3253
02:15:15.871 --> 02:15:19.350
<v Speaker 3>And so we just decided to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how can we flesh this out?</v>

3254
02:15:19.351 --> 02:15:22.560
<v Speaker 3>So we just went on these trips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we filmed them as beautifully as we</v>

3255
02:15:22.561 --> 02:15:24.690
<v Speaker 3>could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We film them as completely as we could</v>

3256
02:15:24.691 --> 02:15:26.190
<v Speaker 3>write.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of guys when they go on these</v>

3257
02:15:26.191 --> 02:15:27.030
<v Speaker 3>trips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll film,</v>

3258
02:15:27.570 --> 02:15:29.730
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you arrived and now you're hunting and</v>

3259
02:15:29.731 --> 02:15:30.570
<v Speaker 3>then you kill an animal.</v>

3260
02:15:30.570 --> 02:15:33.420
<v Speaker 3>And they're just trying to like get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little piece of when we would try and</v>

3261
02:15:33.421 --> 02:15:36.600
<v Speaker 3>film everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when we got done,</v>

3262
02:15:37.050 --> 02:15:39.450
<v Speaker 3>we started putting together our first</v>
<v Speaker 3>film and we thought,</v>

3263
02:15:39.451 --> 02:15:40.770
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll put together a film,</v>

3264
02:15:40.890 --> 02:15:44.910
<v Speaker 3>we'll see what the audience kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>things and then we'll just play from</v>

3265
02:15:44.911 --> 02:15:46.860
<v Speaker 3>there and we'll just go from there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>see what happens.</v>

3266
02:15:46.861 --> 02:15:50.250
<v Speaker 3>And so I started writing the film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>writing the script,</v>

3267
02:15:51.230 --> 02:15:51.931
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>

3268
02:15:51.931 --> 02:15:55.440
<v Speaker 3>all the dialogue that was going to live</v>
<v Speaker 3>outside of what was already naturally</v>

3269
02:15:55.441 --> 02:15:58.440
<v Speaker 3>occurring on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I brought it into Kyle's office and</v>

3270
02:15:58.441 --> 02:15:59.161
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3271
02:15:59.161 --> 02:16:01.500
<v Speaker 3>so read this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he picked up my notebook and he's</v>

3272
02:16:01.501 --> 02:16:02.000
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3273
02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.530
<v Speaker 3>I've never ever heard you talk like</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

3274
02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:06.930
<v Speaker 3>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was I think probably a little bit</v>

3275
02:16:06.931 --> 02:16:09.630
<v Speaker 3>macho and a little bit sensational,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit like,</v>

3276
02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:13.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being actual delivered,</v>

3277
02:16:13.561 --> 02:16:18.220
<v Speaker 3>like delivering a line and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>convey something on film that wasn't me.</v>

3278
02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:19.110
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never,</v>

3279
02:16:19.111 --> 02:16:21.180
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you write like how you talk in</v>

3280
02:16:21.181 --> 02:16:23.310
<v Speaker 3>the office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you're ranting and raving and</v>

3281
02:16:23.311 --> 02:16:25.140
<v Speaker 3>talking about wildlife and talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>your experiences,</v>

3282
02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:26.183
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>

3283
02:16:26.580 --> 02:16:28.500
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like paint a picture for us,</v>

3284
02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:30.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

3285
02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:32.710
<v Speaker 3>and answer some questions maybe that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have of your own.</v>

3286
02:16:33.200 --> 02:16:36.340
<v Speaker 3>And so I started writing in that manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we released our first film in</v>

3287
02:16:36.341 --> 02:16:38.840
<v Speaker 3>2012 or 13.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3288
02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:40.490
<v Speaker 3>the river's divide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3289
02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:43.540
<v Speaker 3>was a story about a deer that I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting for two years in North Dakota</v>

3290
02:16:43.630 --> 02:16:46.090
<v Speaker 3>and it just took off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3291
02:16:46.091 --> 02:16:47.310
<v Speaker 3>Watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve,</v>

3292
02:16:47.430 --> 02:16:49.950
<v Speaker 3>Steve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve Watch named Steve.</v>

3293
02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:51.730
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a friend of mine named him,</v>

3294
02:16:51.820 --> 02:16:54.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because a friend of his,</v>

3295
02:16:54.260 --> 02:16:55.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whose name Steve said,</v>

3296
02:16:56.050 --> 02:16:59.380
<v Speaker 3>the fact that you named deer is idiotic</v>
<v Speaker 3>and completely stupid.</v>

3297
02:16:59.381 --> 02:17:02.390
<v Speaker 3>And my friend Jeff said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great that the next year we find is new.</v>

3298
02:17:02.390 --> 02:17:06.460
<v Speaker 3>The name Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a weird thing when you watch a lot</v>

3299
02:17:06.461 --> 02:17:09.940
<v Speaker 3>of these shows and people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a piece of property in the trail</v>

3300
02:17:09.941 --> 02:17:12.550
<v Speaker 3>cameras and they have all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>different names to these deer.</v>

3301
02:17:12.551 --> 02:17:15.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where it gets real squirrely too.</v>

3302
02:17:15.131 --> 02:17:16.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I do it too.</v>

3303
02:17:16.331 --> 02:17:19.330
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>

3304
02:17:19.331 --> 02:17:20.230
<v Speaker 3>It's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we do,</v>

3305
02:17:20.470 --> 02:17:23.290
<v Speaker 3>and it's funny because we were actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about this in the blind one day</v>

3306
02:17:23.291 --> 02:17:26.410
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we name things right?</v>

3307
02:17:26.430 --> 02:17:28.390
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] if you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have two sons,</v>

3308
02:17:28.391 --> 02:17:29.440
<v Speaker 3>you don't go yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

3309
02:17:29.441 --> 02:17:31.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's my skinny boy,</v>

3310
02:17:31.180 --> 02:17:33.910
<v Speaker 3>the one that does okay in school and</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the little fat one that we can't</v>

3311
02:17:33.911 --> 02:17:35.380
<v Speaker 3>keep pees on the fork with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3312
02:17:35.381 --> 02:17:37.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are my two kids here.</v>

3313
02:17:37.001 --> 02:17:37.571
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3314
02:17:37.571 --> 02:17:39.670
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is Bob and Jeff.</v>

3315
02:17:39.700 --> 02:17:40.533
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3316
02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:43.180
<v Speaker 3>and so like when were deer hunting with</v>
<v Speaker 3>these animals?</v>

3317
02:17:43.210 --> 02:17:45.340
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're on Lanai,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have this opportunity,</v>

3318
02:17:45.341 --> 02:17:48.850
<v Speaker 3>but if you were there all year long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might be like,</v>

3319
02:17:48.851 --> 02:17:51.160
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw the Bach with the crooked.</v>

3320
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:52.840
<v Speaker 3>You might be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw crooked horn,</v>

3321
02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:54.370
<v Speaker 3>I saw him again tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3322
02:17:54.371 --> 02:17:57.130
<v Speaker 3>and then it rather than saying to your</v>
<v Speaker 3>wife,</v>

3323
02:17:57.131 --> 02:17:58.540
<v Speaker 3>your girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body's saying,</v>

3324
02:17:58.541 --> 02:17:59.380
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that,</v>

3325
02:17:59.410 --> 02:18:00.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one block that I'm on it with the</v>

3326
02:18:00.821 --> 02:18:03.580
<v Speaker 3>Krogan instead of going down that road,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you start nicknaming all this stuff,</v>

3327
02:18:03.581 --> 02:18:04.750
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People name their cars.</v>

3328
02:18:04.751 --> 02:18:07.360
<v Speaker 3>We named motorcycles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We not,</v>

3329
02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:08.201
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

3330
02:18:08.201 --> 02:18:12.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you got this far in this hunting</v>

3331
02:18:12.161 --> 02:18:14.920
<v Speaker 3>journey and you just recently started</v>
<v Speaker 3>elk hunting.</v>

3332
02:18:16.220 --> 02:18:18.910
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>September is only so long.</v>

3333
02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:20.640
<v Speaker 3>And like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the Arctic,</v>

3334
02:18:20.690 --> 02:18:23.520
<v Speaker 3>so I would just always go moose hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Caribou hunting and yeah,</v>

3335
02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:24.420
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3336
02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:25.780
<v Speaker 3>no excuse whatsoever.</v>

3337
02:18:25.780 --> 02:18:26.710
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hunted,</v>

3338
02:18:26.770 --> 02:18:29.110
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few years ago in Colorado,</v>

3339
02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.340
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

3340
02:18:30.341 --> 02:18:31.810
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hunted cow elk.</v>

3341
02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:34.480
<v Speaker 3>I went on a cow elk hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I literally,</v>

3342
02:18:34.500 --> 02:18:36.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hunt lasted three minutes.</v>

3343
02:18:36.550 --> 02:18:38.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hiked up in the pitch black.</v>

3344
02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:39.660
<v Speaker 3>I hiked up to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3345
02:18:39.850 --> 02:18:43.810
<v Speaker 3>11,000 feet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a second sun came up and there's a huge</v>

3346
02:18:43.811 --> 02:18:46.450
<v Speaker 3>cal look at 30 yards and I shot her and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3347
02:18:46.451 --> 02:18:48.850
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's done.</v>

3348
02:18:49.090 --> 02:18:50.980
<v Speaker 3>And so I cut her up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cleaned her up,</v>

3349
02:18:50.981 --> 02:18:55.981
<v Speaker 3>and I just had always went to Alaska</v>
<v Speaker 3>during September and not in the elk</v>

3350
02:18:56.291 --> 02:18:57.550
<v Speaker 3>mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And finally it was just like,</v>

3351
02:18:57.551 --> 02:18:59.440
<v Speaker 3>I need to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was awesome.</v>

3352
02:18:59.530 --> 02:19:01.840
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a good and bad experience,</v>

3353
02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:04.870
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great experience with like the morning</v>

3354
02:19:04.871 --> 02:19:07.600
<v Speaker 3>that I killed was sensational.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is misty rainy.</v>

3355
02:19:07.601 --> 02:19:11.560
<v Speaker 3>The Bulls were screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything was very wild where way back</v>

3356
02:19:11.561 --> 02:19:12.940
<v Speaker 3>in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really sensational,</v>

3357
02:19:12.941 --> 02:19:14.680
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really impactful.</v>

3358
02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:16.480
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but up to that point,</v>

3359
02:19:16.481 --> 02:19:20.020
<v Speaker 3>the area that I was hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shell creek range in Nevada is they</v>

3360
02:19:20.021 --> 02:19:23.950
<v Speaker 3>only have a few tags there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you get a tag,</v>

3361
02:19:23.980 --> 02:19:24.813
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3362
02:19:24.820 --> 02:19:27.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher is basically all their family and</v>

3363
02:19:27.741 --> 02:19:30.230
<v Speaker 3>friends to come and help because it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>such a rare tag.</v>

3364
02:19:30.650 --> 02:19:34.940
<v Speaker 3>So there's 30 guys to every tag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I saw four wheelers and side by</v>

3365
02:19:34.941 --> 02:19:39.500
<v Speaker 3>sides and there's complete and utter</v>
<v Speaker 3>intrusion,</v>

3366
02:19:39.530 --> 02:19:43.070
<v Speaker 3>negative intrusion by hunters into this</v>
<v Speaker 3>wilderness.</v>

3367
02:19:43.130 --> 02:19:45.230
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it needs to be stopped in my</v>

3368
02:19:45.231 --> 02:19:47.690
<v Speaker 3>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you should have to leave all your</v>

3369
02:19:47.691 --> 02:19:51.440
<v Speaker 3>motorized vehicles on pavement and going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the mountains on foot.</v>

3370
02:19:51.470 --> 02:19:53.660
<v Speaker 3>That's my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

3371
02:19:53.720 --> 02:19:58.280
<v Speaker 3>this area that I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had something like 400 miles of,</v>

3372
02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:02.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>improved a two track roads that guys had</v>

3373
02:20:02.931 --> 02:20:05.090
<v Speaker 3>literally just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they see something over here they want</v>

3374
02:20:05.091 --> 02:20:06.710
<v Speaker 3>to get to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just start driving.</v>

3375
02:20:06.710 --> 02:20:10.400
<v Speaker 3>They're side by side right across the</v>
<v Speaker 3>sage brush and they just start beating</v>

3376
02:20:10.401 --> 02:20:12.110
<v Speaker 3>this stuff down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And pretty soon there's a road.</v>

3377
02:20:12.111 --> 02:20:14.780
<v Speaker 3>And so this area started out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just make these numbers up cause I</v>

3378
02:20:14.781 --> 02:20:17.750
<v Speaker 3>don't remember the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they started out with like a hundred</v>

3379
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:22.750
<v Speaker 3>miles of dirt roads in this mountain</v>
<v Speaker 3>system quickly expanded a 400 miles of</v>

3380
02:20:22.971 --> 02:20:26.150
<v Speaker 3>dirt roads because people just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>access wherever they want to go with an</v>

3381
02:20:26.151 --> 02:20:30.180
<v Speaker 3>atv really started to impact the elk to</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they,</v>

3382
02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:35.180
<v Speaker 3>they were getting pushed out of their</v>
<v Speaker 3>winter ranges by people on Atvs and</v>

3383
02:20:35.181 --> 02:20:39.410
<v Speaker 3>they're getting bullied so badly by</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that were accessing the area by</v>

3384
02:20:39.411 --> 02:20:43.310
<v Speaker 3>atb that they just recently closed down</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like 200 miles of roads.</v>

3385
02:20:43.311 --> 02:20:45.230
<v Speaker 3>And I think they're trying to even close</v>
<v Speaker 3>down even more.</v>

3386
02:20:45.231 --> 02:20:47.810
<v Speaker 3>But as far as I'm concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be closed down.</v>

3387
02:20:48.010 --> 02:20:49.250
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to go and do,</v>

3388
02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:52.160
<v Speaker 3>if you want to go and ride your atv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go ride your atv.</v>

3389
02:20:52.220 --> 02:20:55.520
<v Speaker 3>If your elk hunting leave the atb on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>road right by ATV.</v>

3390
02:20:55.521 --> 02:20:57.260
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about like those little</v>
<v Speaker 3>rangers?</v>

3391
02:20:57.261 --> 02:20:57.950
<v Speaker 3>Those little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3392
02:20:57.950 --> 02:20:59.450
<v Speaker 3>mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly side by sides.</v>

3393
02:20:59.451 --> 02:21:01.550
<v Speaker 3>There are a couple of quads but mostly</v>
<v Speaker 3>side by side.</v>

3394
02:21:01.630 --> 02:21:02.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

3395
02:21:02.760 --> 02:21:03.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are very,</v>

3396
02:21:03.841 --> 02:21:05.520
<v Speaker 1>very controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>

3397
02:21:05.521 --> 02:21:08.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Nevada a couple of years back,</v>

3398
02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:09.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

3399
02:21:10.290 --> 02:21:12.390
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the desert area,</v>

3400
02:21:12.391 --> 02:21:15.090
<v Speaker 1>like sage brush area near,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3401
02:21:16.040 --> 02:21:19.290
<v Speaker 1>a few hours outside of Reno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3402
02:21:19.320 --> 02:21:22.090
<v Speaker 1>we experienced a few of those where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were doing,</v>

3403
02:21:22.190 --> 02:21:23.910
<v Speaker 1>they were using them illegally and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't,</v>

3404
02:21:23.970 --> 02:21:26.310
<v Speaker 1>they're driving into these areas where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3405
02:21:26.311 --> 02:21:28.500
<v Speaker 1>you're off the road and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

3406
02:21:29.310 --> 02:21:32.070
<v Speaker 1>just driving through these open plains</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas with these,</v>

3407
02:21:32.071 --> 02:21:33.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>atvs and aren't supposed to be there and</v>

3408
02:21:33.781 --> 02:21:38.781
<v Speaker 1>spook and deer and impacting the</v>
<v Speaker 1>substrate and the soils and the bad.</v>

3409
02:21:40.560 --> 02:21:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on one hand I say,</v>

3410
02:21:42.991 --> 02:21:43.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3411
02:21:44.370 --> 02:21:47.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not the worst thing in the world in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of like if you need to get an</v>

3412
02:21:47.701 --> 02:21:50.160
<v Speaker 1>animal out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of agree with it,</v>

3413
02:21:50.161 --> 02:21:53.430
<v Speaker 1>but I kind of understand your point and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you shouldn't even be able to do</v>

3414
02:21:53.431 --> 02:21:56.790
<v Speaker 1>it with that cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause then you're going to look,</v>

3415
02:21:56.820 --> 02:22:00.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's going to be really hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate whether or not a person should</v>

3416
02:22:00.511 --> 02:22:02.940
<v Speaker 1>or shouldn't be able to use it at any</v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time.</v>

3417
02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:04.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not talking about like if</v>

3418
02:22:04.701 --> 02:22:08.210
<v Speaker 3>somebody that's handicapped or somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's truly debilitated,</v>

3419
02:22:08.211 --> 02:22:09.110
<v Speaker 3>wants access,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there,</v>

3420
02:22:09.111 --> 02:22:11.750
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By all means I'm talking about able</v>

3421
02:22:11.751 --> 02:22:15.740
<v Speaker 3>bodied middle aged and young men are not</v>

3422
02:22:15.740 --> 02:22:17.570
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not working hard.</v>

3423
02:22:17.571 --> 02:22:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing,</v>

3424
02:22:19.161 --> 02:22:19.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

3425
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:22.180
<v Speaker 1>they want to be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also people that want</v>

3426
02:22:22.181 --> 02:22:24.440
<v Speaker 1>to be able to go in there on horseback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3427
02:22:24.441 --> 02:22:25.860
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another argument.</v>

3428
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:29.070
<v Speaker 1>I've heard people that have been hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

3429
02:22:29.071 --> 02:22:31.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a quiet area and then all of a sudden</v>

3430
02:22:31.441 --> 02:22:34.440
<v Speaker 1>five people come by on horseback in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of them.</v>

3431
02:22:34.470 --> 02:22:36.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was an outfitter and the</v>

3432
02:22:36.181 --> 02:22:39.150
<v Speaker 1>outfitters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they took the time to hike 19</v>

3433
02:22:39.151 --> 02:22:42.510
<v Speaker 1>miles deep into the back country and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3434
02:22:42.630 --> 02:22:44.040
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard hall.</v>

3435
02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:46.830
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people come in on horseback and</v>

3436
02:22:48.290 --> 02:22:50.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got pack mules and all sorts of,</v>

3437
02:22:50.611 --> 02:22:53.910
<v Speaker 1>this shit is a fucking caravan of</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals and people and they spook and</v>

3438
02:22:53.911 --> 02:22:54.744
<v Speaker 1>everything out.</v>

3439
02:22:55.440 --> 02:22:56.041
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>

3440
02:22:56.041 --> 02:22:57.860
<v Speaker 3>it all comes down to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3441
02:22:58.560 --> 02:22:59.760
<v Speaker 3>that barrier of entry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3442
02:22:59.790 --> 02:23:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thrive the most,</v>

3443
02:23:01.171 --> 02:23:03.270
<v Speaker 3>like it's for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sure for you too,</v>

3444
02:23:03.271 --> 02:23:07.440
<v Speaker 3>it's the most rewarding to do the work</v>
<v Speaker 3>backpack in software,</v>

3445
02:23:07.441 --> 02:23:08.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's suffering.</v>

3446
02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:10.500
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel like we should have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>suffer for these.</v>

3447
02:23:10.580 --> 02:23:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also rewarding to do it on foot</v>

3448
02:23:13.881 --> 02:23:18.380
<v Speaker 1>because you're going deep into this area</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hard to get to.</v>

3449
02:23:18.650 --> 02:23:20.810
<v Speaker 1>And when you do get there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing there.</v>

3450
02:23:20.811 --> 02:23:21.740
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

3451
02:23:22.010 --> 02:23:24.400
<v Speaker 1>if you're the type of person that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to,</v>

3452
02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:26.330
<v Speaker 1>to hike in seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

3453
02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:27.410
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 miles,</v>

3454
02:23:27.620 --> 02:23:30.350
<v Speaker 1>the deeper you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the further you're going to distance</v>

3455
02:23:30.351 --> 02:23:32.540
<v Speaker 1>yourself from everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because most people aren't going to do</v>

3456
02:23:32.541 --> 02:23:33.374
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3457
02:23:33.530 --> 02:23:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Most people aren't going to like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>

3458
02:23:36.290 --> 02:23:38.120
<v Speaker 1>that's the weird thing about public</v>
<v Speaker 1>land,</v>

3459
02:23:38.121 --> 02:23:39.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like kind of anybody can get in</v>

3460
02:23:39.741 --> 02:23:41.870
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who's going to get in there 22</v>

3461
02:23:41.871 --> 02:23:42.710
<v Speaker 1>miles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3462
02:23:42.890 --> 02:23:43.780
<v Speaker 1>Very few people.</v>

3463
02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:45.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have people all the time,</v>

3464
02:23:45.561 --> 02:23:46.910
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you go through this too,</v>

3465
02:23:46.911 --> 02:23:50.060
<v Speaker 3>but I'll kill an animal and hunters</v>
<v Speaker 3>right away,</v>

3466
02:23:50.120 --> 02:23:53.060
<v Speaker 3>they want to identify you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that on public or private land?</v>

3467
02:23:53.580 --> 02:23:55.280
<v Speaker 3>What was on public land?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3468
02:23:55.281 --> 02:23:55.910
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3469
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:58.490
<v Speaker 3>and people think that it's this and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

3470
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:59.001
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3471
02:23:59.001 --> 02:24:00.660
<v Speaker 3>and there's certain areas of country</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more difficult,</v>

3472
02:24:00.661 --> 02:24:02.690
<v Speaker 3>but people think of you killed an animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>on public land.</v>

3473
02:24:02.691 --> 02:24:04.490
<v Speaker 3>Like you're real hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause you had to deal with other</v>

3474
02:24:04.491 --> 02:24:06.020
<v Speaker 3>hunters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know where I went,</v>

3475
02:24:06.021 --> 02:24:07.880
<v Speaker 3>there was not another person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

3476
02:24:07.881 --> 02:24:10.940
<v Speaker 3>it's like when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're accessing,</v>

3477
02:24:10.941 --> 02:24:12.910
<v Speaker 3>when you're going deep and there's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>atvs,</v>

3478
02:24:12.920 --> 02:24:15.320
<v Speaker 3>there's not side by side and you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually hike into an area,</v>

3479
02:24:15.321 --> 02:24:16.820
<v Speaker 3>you can get away from these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3480
02:24:16.821 --> 02:24:18.830
<v Speaker 3>You can get away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are willing to access.</v>

3481
02:24:18.831 --> 02:24:21.410
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like to celebrate public land</v>

3482
02:24:21.411 --> 02:24:23.060
<v Speaker 3>cause you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are not a guided hunt.</v>

3483
02:24:23.061 --> 02:24:25.110
<v Speaker 3>You weren't in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's also a wealth both</v>

3484
02:24:25.110 --> 02:24:26.730
<v Speaker 1>thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People want to,</v>

3485
02:24:27.740 --> 02:24:31.110
<v Speaker 1>they want to disparage accomplishments</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people that do things that they're,</v>

3486
02:24:31.130 --> 02:24:33.250
<v Speaker 1>the wealth is the barrier for entry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3487
02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem I have with that is</v>

3488
02:24:36.330 --> 02:24:39.780
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wildest of the wild is the place</v>

3489
02:24:39.781 --> 02:24:41.610
<v Speaker 1>where people can't go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3490
02:24:41.611 --> 02:24:44.280
<v Speaker 1>and if you can get to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing is like if somebody</v>

3491
02:24:44.281 --> 02:24:45.114
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3492
02:24:45.270 --> 02:24:47.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you a tag for Nevada</v>

3493
02:24:47.941 --> 02:24:52.941
<v Speaker 1>for some private land area that is just</v>
<v Speaker 1>an unbelievable El Con,</v>

3494
02:24:53.130 --> 02:24:55.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's a private land too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm gonna give it to you.</v>

3495
02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:57.630
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to go on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've got to do that because it's</v>

3496
02:24:57.631 --> 02:24:59.340
<v Speaker 1>private land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that.</v>

3497
02:24:59.370 --> 02:24:59.970
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

3498
02:24:59.970 --> 02:25:01.440
<v Speaker 1>can I get it next year too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3499
02:25:01.441 --> 02:25:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Most people are only saying that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't do it because they can't afford</v>

3500
02:25:04.351 --> 02:25:05.730
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they want to disparage anybody</v>

3501
02:25:05.731 --> 02:25:09.660
<v Speaker 1>you can because there's a barrier for</v>
<v Speaker 1>entry and that barrier is financial.</v>

3502
02:25:10.290 --> 02:25:12.810
<v Speaker 1>But those areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go,</v>

3503
02:25:12.930 --> 02:25:15.540
<v Speaker 1>if you can get into these private</v>
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>

3504
02:25:15.810 --> 02:25:19.860
<v Speaker 1>those are the areas where they're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild because there's no fucking people.</v>

3505
02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:22.020
<v Speaker 1>You can't go back there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3506
02:25:22.030 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 1>And you get to see these animals</v>

3507
02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:28.570
<v Speaker 3>the way they would be when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when there is no access to the public</v>

3508
02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:29.660
<v Speaker 3>because there isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3509
02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:31.420
<v Speaker 3>And that's fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I get it.</v>

3510
02:25:31.421 --> 02:25:34.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean I get the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sentiment and I get why people would</v>

3511
02:25:34.481 --> 02:25:37.000
<v Speaker 3>be upset that some people can afford it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and others can't.</v>

3512
02:25:38.050 --> 02:25:38.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

3513
02:25:38.740 --> 02:25:39.850
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely,</v>

3514
02:25:39.851 --> 02:25:41.500
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3515
02:25:41.501 --> 02:25:43.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's everybody wants to participate.</v>

3516
02:25:43.901 --> 02:25:46.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean wants to see and access all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>different areas and,</v>

3517
02:25:46.810 --> 02:25:49.630
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can't write and it's,</v>

3518
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:53.110
<v Speaker 3>it's a negative experience of somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>can write and I feel the same way.</v>

3519
02:25:53.111 --> 02:25:54.400
<v Speaker 3>Like you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3520
02:25:54.401 --> 02:25:56.890
<v Speaker 3>I see this every year when I go to some</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these hunting shows around the</v>

3521
02:25:56.891 --> 02:25:58.870
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'll go to wild sheep foundation</v>

3522
02:25:58.871 --> 02:26:01.960
<v Speaker 3>and they bring up the Montana bighorn</v>
<v Speaker 3>tag for sale.</v>

3523
02:26:02.410 --> 02:26:04.280
<v Speaker 3>I would love to buy that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

3524
02:26:04.350 --> 02:26:05.770
<v Speaker 3>those things are so ridiculous.</v>

3525
02:26:05.770 --> 02:26:09.070
<v Speaker 3>When we have those auctions in the tags</v>
<v Speaker 3>go for hundreds of thousands of dollars,</v>

3526
02:26:09.071 --> 02:26:12.130
<v Speaker 3>$350,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking crazy.</v>

3527
02:26:12.610 --> 02:26:14.470
<v Speaker 3>That really is fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3528
02:26:14.471 --> 02:26:17.500
<v Speaker 3>the fact that people spend that money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the other thing is,</v>

3529
02:26:17.501 --> 02:26:19.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a guy who did that,</v>

3530
02:26:19.271 --> 02:26:22.960
<v Speaker 3>who hired these people to sit on this</v>
<v Speaker 3>one fucking big horn.</v>

3531
02:26:22.990 --> 02:26:25.110
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For months they stay.</v>

3532
02:26:25.180 --> 02:26:29.890
<v Speaker 3>They hired these guys to basically be</v>
<v Speaker 3>fulltime employees to scout this one</v>

3533
02:26:29.891 --> 02:26:33.580
<v Speaker 3>gigantic big horn tracking around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>follow it,</v>

3534
02:26:33.581 --> 02:26:36.940
<v Speaker 3>keep an eye on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then finally the season opened in.</v>

3535
02:26:36.941 --> 02:26:39.460
<v Speaker 3>This guy trudged in there and killed it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and killed it.</v>

3536
02:26:39.620 --> 02:26:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what I would do if I was a</v>

3537
02:26:41.801 --> 02:26:44.080
<v Speaker 3>billionaire or had the cash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd buy the tag.</v>

3538
02:26:44.140 --> 02:26:48.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you right now to your face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would buy that tag often if I had that</v>

3539
02:26:48.491 --> 02:26:52.210
<v Speaker 3>kind of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But instead of hiring the crew to find</v>

3540
02:26:52.211 --> 02:26:54.700
<v Speaker 3>me a big Ram and waltzing in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an opening day and killing it,</v>

3541
02:26:54.730 --> 02:26:57.520
<v Speaker 3>I'd fire the crew because I have enough</v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

3542
02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:00.210
<v Speaker 3>I'd go in there and spend the entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>season in there myself,</v>

3543
02:27:00.250 --> 02:27:04.420
<v Speaker 3>immersing myself into that wilderness</v>
<v Speaker 3>and using the fact that I have a pile of</v>

3544
02:27:04.421 --> 02:27:08.450
<v Speaker 3>cash at home to live in the wilderness</v>
<v Speaker 3>for 30 days and maybe kill a big Ram,</v>

3545
02:27:08.460 --> 02:27:10.540
<v Speaker 3>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these guys want,</v>

3546
02:27:11.530 --> 02:27:14.140
<v Speaker 3>they want the bragging rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want that giant Ram.</v>

3547
02:27:14.260 --> 02:27:15.580
<v Speaker 3>They want the bragging rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3548
02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:16.960
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a resume.</v>

3549
02:27:17.310 --> 02:27:19.250
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a resume of animals.</v>

3550
02:27:19.251 --> 02:27:20.000
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

3551
02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:23.080
<v Speaker 3>I kind of equate it to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3552
02:27:23.170 --> 02:27:24.520
<v Speaker 3>I've talked about this a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

3553
02:27:24.521 --> 02:27:26.230
<v Speaker 3>but when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we were kids,</v>

3554
02:27:26.231 --> 02:27:28.780
<v Speaker 3>like if you went fishing with your dad</v>
<v Speaker 3>or hunting with your dad or whatever,</v>

3555
02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:31.840
<v Speaker 3>like let's say you went down a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>local lake here in California or</v>

3556
02:27:31.841 --> 02:27:33.340
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you guys are going bass fishing,</v>

3557
02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:36.100
<v Speaker 3>you guys go bass fishing and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>catching bass or whatever.</v>

3558
02:27:36.101 --> 02:27:38.650
<v Speaker 3>And then all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one magical Sunday morning,</v>

3559
02:27:39.130 --> 02:27:42.460
<v Speaker 3>you or your dad hooks a monster bass and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3560
02:27:42.580 --> 02:27:44.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys grab the net and you're have</v>

3561
02:27:44.890 --> 02:27:45.940
<v Speaker 3>the energy and the bolt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3562
02:27:45.941 --> 02:27:46.960
<v Speaker 3>grab that real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3563
02:27:46.961 --> 02:27:47.710
<v Speaker 3>keep your rod tip up.</v>

3564
02:27:47.710 --> 02:27:49.720
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of energy around this big</v>

3565
02:27:49.721 --> 02:27:51.370
<v Speaker 3>fish that's going to be really hard to</v>
<v Speaker 3>land.</v>

3566
02:27:51.371 --> 02:27:55.120
<v Speaker 3>It's such a special occurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You finally get the net underneath them,</v>

3567
02:27:55.121 --> 02:27:56.830
<v Speaker 3>you get this big bass in the net and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3568
02:27:57.040 --> 02:27:59.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're hugging your high five and you're</v>

3569
02:27:59.231 --> 02:27:59.741
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my God,</v>

3570
02:27:59.741 --> 02:28:02.590
<v Speaker 3>we've come to this like 30 times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the biggest fish you've ever caught</v>

3571
02:28:03.460 --> 02:28:04.960
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3572
02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:05.741
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

3573
02:28:05.741 --> 02:28:07.900
<v Speaker 3>and then you take the pictures and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>go home and tell your,</v>

3574
02:28:07.910 --> 02:28:09.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd tell your mom,</v>

3575
02:28:09.101 --> 02:28:10.060
<v Speaker 3>you'd tell your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3576
02:28:10.061 --> 02:28:12.670
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he came up and he ate the frog and</v>

3577
02:28:12.671 --> 02:28:15.610
<v Speaker 3>we set the hook and you tell that hotel</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have that energy that lives</v>

3578
02:28:15.611 --> 02:28:19.960
<v Speaker 3>around that fantastic experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these guys are trying to buy that.</v>

3579
02:28:20.500 --> 02:28:23.420
<v Speaker 3>Like that's a remarkable experience when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

3580
02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:28.160
<v Speaker 3>when you go elk hunting and you stumble</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a really big bowl or you do your</v>

3581
02:28:28.161 --> 02:28:31.040
<v Speaker 3>homework and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you keep truncating down the</v>

3582
02:28:31.041 --> 02:28:33.020
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you keep taking steps into the</v>

3583
02:28:33.021 --> 02:28:35.750
<v Speaker 3>wilderness down until you find this</v>
<v Speaker 3>really massive bowl.</v>

3584
02:28:36.380 --> 02:28:38.410
<v Speaker 3>You slip in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have the wind right,</v>

3585
02:28:38.430 --> 02:28:40.730
<v Speaker 3>your hidden in a Bush or against a rock</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a,</v>

3586
02:28:41.180 --> 02:28:43.210
<v Speaker 3>and here he comes and you can't believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3587
02:28:43.211 --> 02:28:45.800
<v Speaker 3>You've done your homework and you've</v>
<v Speaker 3>truncated down this experience.</v>

3588
02:28:45.801 --> 02:28:47.810
<v Speaker 3>And here he comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd come to full draw and he,</v>

3589
02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:51.080
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stopped at 30 yards and you find your</v>

3590
02:28:51.081 --> 02:28:51.914
<v Speaker 3>pen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

3591
02:28:52.390 --> 02:28:54.740
<v Speaker 3>and you watch your Arrow Zip right</v>
<v Speaker 3>through them and you know you're looking</v>

3592
02:28:54.741 --> 02:28:57.410
<v Speaker 3>around for somebody to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just a huge experience.</v>

3593
02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:02.300
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to bottle that up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>write a big fat check and try to</v>

3594
02:29:02.301 --> 02:29:05.450
<v Speaker 3>experience that in one afternoon that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to express</v>

3595
02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:09.380
<v Speaker 1>clearancing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience it or is it that they want</v>

3596
02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:12.500
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to show that they have the thing</v>

3597
02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:16.130
<v Speaker 3>they want to show it because that</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience I just described you,</v>

3598
02:29:16.131 --> 02:29:19.880
<v Speaker 3>those emotions everyone can relate to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are people that have done this can</v>

3599
02:29:19.881 --> 02:29:21.910
<v Speaker 3>relate to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when they show you their pictures of</v>

3600
02:29:21.911 --> 02:29:24.320
<v Speaker 3>their 200 inch ram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all everybody's got,</v>

3601
02:29:24.321 --> 02:29:29.321
<v Speaker 3>oh man and what all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how all my assault and really has no</v>

3602
02:29:29.541 --> 02:29:31.280
<v Speaker 3>knees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no interest in that and whatsoever.</v>

3603
02:29:31.700 --> 02:29:33.380
<v Speaker 3>That is literally just to build a</v>
<v Speaker 3>resume.</v>

3604
02:29:33.381 --> 02:29:35.300
<v Speaker 3>Same with the big main lion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3605
02:29:35.320 --> 02:29:36.890
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you went in and it,</v>

3606
02:29:36.980 --> 02:29:40.700
<v Speaker 3>it is a truly wilderness experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've really did your homework,</v>

3607
02:29:40.701 --> 02:29:43.280
<v Speaker 3>and I know I'm splitting hairs here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is how my mind works.</v>

3608
02:29:44.180 --> 02:29:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Telling me the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to hear it,</v>

3609
02:29:45.651 --> 02:29:49.390
<v Speaker 3>but if it's anything other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it's not for [inaudible].</v>

3610
02:29:49.680 --> 02:29:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing about you.</v>

3611
02:29:51.871 --> 02:29:56.871
<v Speaker 1>What you're saying mirrors what I hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>from guys like Steve Rinella and people</v>

3612
02:29:56.911 --> 02:30:01.290
<v Speaker 1>that are really accomplished hunters</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are very ethical and have the right</v>

3613
02:30:01.291 --> 02:30:05.280
<v Speaker 1>mindset is that this is supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult or hard.</v>

3614
02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The experience is supposed to be,</v>

3615
02:30:07.351 --> 02:30:10.890
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to hike all those miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to go up and down those</v>

3616
02:30:10.891 --> 02:30:12.480
<v Speaker 1>mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be exhausting.</v>

3617
02:30:12.780 --> 02:30:15.120
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be hard to get close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these creatures.</v>

3618
02:30:15.121 --> 02:30:17.940
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to not know what's over</v>

3619
02:30:17.941 --> 02:30:19.170
<v Speaker 1>the next ridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3620
02:30:19.320 --> 02:30:23.370
<v Speaker 1>It's suppose that's what's part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reward and if that reward isn't there,</v>

3621
02:30:23.520 --> 02:30:26.330
<v Speaker 1>it's like shooting fish in a barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shooting fish in a barrel is</v>

3622
02:30:26.850 --> 02:30:28.950
<v Speaker 3>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not interesting at all.</v>

3623
02:30:29.130 --> 02:30:31.020
<v Speaker 3>It's great if you definitely need a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish.</v>

3624
02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:32.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3625
02:30:32.340 --> 02:30:33.300
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's okay.</v>

3626
02:30:33.301 --> 02:30:35.100
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are little,</v>

3627
02:30:35.130 --> 02:30:37.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can cut little corners in life,</v>

3628
02:30:37.201 --> 02:30:38.960
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

3629
02:30:39.630 --> 02:30:43.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying everything has to be like</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause cause then somebody might say,</v>

3630
02:30:43.111 --> 02:30:45.860
<v Speaker 3>well you're using a compound ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the guys using a recurve,</v>

3631
02:30:45.890 --> 02:30:49.290
<v Speaker 3>well that's a good argument if an</v>
<v Speaker 3>argument gets weird,</v>

3632
02:30:49.291 --> 02:30:50.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're doing it,</v>

3633
02:30:50.910 --> 02:30:54.690
<v Speaker 3>we say if you're doing it well and good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>

3634
02:30:55.290 --> 02:30:57.270
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're an ethical,</v>

3635
02:30:57.271 --> 02:31:00.150
<v Speaker 3>if you're hunting for the right reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're asking yourself these big</v>

3636
02:31:00.151 --> 02:31:02.430
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't matter if you pick up a</v>

3637
02:31:02.431 --> 02:31:06.690
<v Speaker 3>rifle and you shoot them at a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>yards or you pick up a recurve and you</v>

3638
02:31:06.691 --> 02:31:08.180
<v Speaker 3>shoot him at 10 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I,</v>

3639
02:31:08.460 --> 02:31:10.980
<v Speaker 3>I know recurve shooters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can only shoot like 15,</v>

3640
02:31:10.981 --> 02:31:13.080
<v Speaker 3>18 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know recurve shooters that can shoot</v>

3641
02:31:13.081 --> 02:31:13.711
<v Speaker 3>50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>60,</v>

3642
02:31:13.711 --> 02:31:16.860
<v Speaker 3>70 yards and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3643
02:31:16.861 --> 02:31:18.810
<v Speaker 3>so we're all different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all liked it.</v>

3644
02:31:18.870 --> 02:31:20.160
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people really</v>

3645
02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:22.440
<v Speaker 1>enjoy shooting the rifles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people really enjoy shooting their</v>

3646
02:31:22.441 --> 02:31:23.700
<v Speaker 1>bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we should split hairs</v>

3647
02:31:23.701 --> 02:31:25.050
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3648
02:31:25.080 --> 02:31:28.230
<v Speaker 1>just realize that the ball hunter maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to do,</v>

3649
02:31:28.560 --> 02:31:32.670
<v Speaker 1>go to the next level of immersion to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself next to an animal and,</v>

3650
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:34.770
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rifle hunter,</v>

3651
02:31:34.771 --> 02:31:35.604
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

3652
02:31:35.760 --> 02:31:37.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3653
02:31:37.111 --> 02:31:38.640
<v Speaker 1>there's a slightly less barrier of</v>
<v Speaker 1>entry,</v>

3654
02:31:38.641 --> 02:31:40.260
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything wrong with it.</v>

3655
02:31:40.290 --> 02:31:40.981
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rifle,</v>

3656
02:31:40.981 --> 02:31:43.050
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it argue and I agree with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

3657
02:31:43.051 --> 02:31:47.730
<v Speaker 1>that rifle hunting on public land is</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably more difficult than bow hunting</v>

3658
02:31:47.731 --> 02:31:51.990
<v Speaker 1>on private land without question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And certainly more difficult than bow</v>

3659
02:31:51.991 --> 02:31:55.890
<v Speaker 1>hunting on public land because bonners</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this,</v>

3660
02:31:55.980 --> 02:32:00.270
<v Speaker 1>the reason I started bow hunting was</v>
<v Speaker 1>have access to public land prior to the</v>

3661
02:32:00.271 --> 02:32:05.010
<v Speaker 1>rifle season to extend my season to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the woods when it's quiet and no one</v>

3662
02:32:05.011 --> 02:32:08.160
<v Speaker 1>else around as sea animals acting be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally,</v>

3663
02:32:08.460 --> 02:32:12.420
<v Speaker 1>rather than seeing this orange army and</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing everything running for its life.</v>

3664
02:32:12.540 --> 02:32:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3665
02:32:12.950 --> 02:32:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3666
02:32:14.101 --> 02:32:15.450
<v Speaker 1>That's where it gets squirrely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3667
02:32:15.451 --> 02:32:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public access is great,</v>

3668
02:32:17.671 --> 02:32:20.010
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does get really weird and I've</v>

3669
02:32:20.011 --> 02:32:21.870
<v Speaker 1>experienced it when there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunters around.</v>

3670
02:32:21.900 --> 02:32:24.510
<v Speaker 1>It gets real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was in Wisconsin for opening day</v>

3671
02:32:24.900 --> 02:32:27.960
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years ago and it is like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>war zone.</v>

3672
02:32:28.140 --> 02:32:30.490
<v Speaker 1>The moment light goes off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear boom,</v>

3673
02:32:30.750 --> 02:32:32.150
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

3674
02:32:33.040 --> 02:32:34.200
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>

3675
02:32:34.260 --> 02:32:36.830
<v Speaker 1>I was with Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we filmed it for meat eater and I looked</v>

3676
02:32:36.900 --> 02:32:39.360
<v Speaker 1>at my whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on man?</v>

3677
02:32:39.361 --> 02:32:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Where are we at war?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3678
02:32:41.281 --> 02:32:42.990
<v Speaker 1>this is opening day in Wisconsin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3679
02:32:42.991 --> 02:32:47.991
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is just everywhere.</v>

3680
02:32:49.020 --> 02:32:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Just gunshots ringing out in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>

3681
02:32:51.390 --> 02:32:52.530
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

3682
02:32:52.531 --> 02:32:55.320
<v Speaker 1>like you know sometimes we like to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about management.</v>

3683
02:32:55.321 --> 02:32:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Not every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not every population needs to be</v>

3684
02:32:57.241 --> 02:33:00.330
<v Speaker 1>managed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but literally you probably can't kill</v>

3685
02:33:00.331 --> 02:33:02.610
<v Speaker 1>enough deer that day in Wisconsin.</v>

3686
02:33:02.610 --> 02:33:05.580
<v Speaker 1>You better manage his fucking deer cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are hitting them with cars all</v>

3687
02:33:05.581 --> 02:33:07.950
<v Speaker 1>day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You literally couldn't kill enough and</v>

3688
02:33:07.951 --> 02:33:09.540
<v Speaker 1>we were eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

3689
02:33:09.570 --> 02:33:13.350
<v Speaker 1>they were eating a lot of corn because a</v>
<v Speaker 1>where my friend Doug durrance farm is</v>

3690
02:33:13.360 --> 02:33:15.570
<v Speaker 1>where we're hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all corn and man,</v>

3691
02:33:15.571 --> 02:33:17.720
<v Speaker 1>they could not have tasted better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3692
02:33:17.940 --> 02:33:19.510
<v Speaker 1>they were so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3693
02:33:19.740 --> 02:33:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's saying we saw tatum that night and</v>

3694
02:33:22.591 --> 02:33:27.591
<v Speaker 1>a cast iron skillet with a garlic salt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and butter and holy shit.</v>

3695
02:33:28.141 --> 02:33:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Was it good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3696
02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:33.990
<v Speaker 1>We're just moaning orgasmic as to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether eating this deer,</v>

3697
02:33:34.260 --> 02:33:35.250
<v Speaker 1>it's cuisine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3698
02:33:35.251 --> 02:33:36.420
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3699
02:33:36.421 --> 02:33:37.610
<v Speaker 1>And you're sitting there with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddies.</v>

3700
02:33:37.611 --> 02:33:38.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3701
02:33:38.010 --> 02:33:40.200
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be and it's valued.</v>

3702
02:33:40.201 --> 02:33:45.201
<v Speaker 1>Freezing cold outside your indoors and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's warm and everybody's happy.</v>

3703
02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

3704
02:33:47.070 --> 02:33:48.570
<v Speaker 1>it was epic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was epic.</v>

3705
02:33:48.600 --> 02:33:49.650
<v Speaker 1>If something to be told.</v>

3706
02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is something to be told.</v>

3707
02:33:52.051 --> 02:33:54.090
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we should probably wrap this up.</v>

3708
02:33:54.091 --> 02:33:57.150
<v Speaker 1>We're about three hours in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I would want people,</v>

3709
02:33:57.450 --> 02:33:59.880
<v Speaker 1>if they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've really curious about this</v>

3710
02:34:00.420 --> 02:34:03.210
<v Speaker 1>endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really would want people to start with</v>

3711
02:34:03.211 --> 02:34:06.570
<v Speaker 1>your films cause I appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that what you're doing,</v>

3712
02:34:06.571 --> 02:34:08.820
<v Speaker 1>if they have the time to sit down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch that whole thing,</v>

3713
02:34:08.821 --> 02:34:12.780
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you represent the best.</v>

3714
02:34:13.820 --> 02:34:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Just the best slice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard.</v>

3715
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Get that slice and 22 minutes and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think Rinella does an amazing job and</v>

3716
02:34:21.041 --> 02:34:24.250
<v Speaker 1>doing it in 22 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think what you're,</v>

3717
02:34:24.310 --> 02:34:29.310
<v Speaker 1>what you've done by turning these into</v>
<v Speaker 1>films and by really giving yourself the</v>

3718
02:34:30.161 --> 02:34:35.161
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to relay your appreciation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wonder and the all of nature and</v>

3719
02:34:35.851 --> 02:34:39.160
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your immersion into that world and to do</v>

3720
02:34:39.161 --> 02:34:43.150
<v Speaker 1>so in such an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an incredibly creative way and</v>

3721
02:34:43.180 --> 02:34:47.200
<v Speaker 1>beautifully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visually stunning way that I think</v>

3722
02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:49.270
<v Speaker 1>you've done an amazing service.</v>

3723
02:34:49.270 --> 02:34:52.180
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a great place for people to</v>

3724
02:34:52.181 --> 02:34:54.430
<v Speaker 1>start to get a look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for people that,</v>

3725
02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:57.010
<v Speaker 1>that do hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they will really appreciate if</v>

3726
02:34:57.011 --> 02:34:59.530
<v Speaker 1>they haven't seen your stuff before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that man.</v>

3727
02:34:59.590 --> 02:35:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we definitely suffer for the work,</v>

3728
02:35:02.951 --> 02:35:07.951
<v Speaker 1>like writing the music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shooting it like we do,</v>

3729
02:35:08.261 --> 02:35:10.990
<v Speaker 1>we want to represent ourselves with</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute purity.</v>

3730
02:35:10.991 --> 02:35:13.660
<v Speaker 1>But we also realize that there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have questions.</v>

3731
02:35:13.661 --> 02:35:16.120
<v Speaker 1>So we try to write and behave in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>manner that,</v>

3732
02:35:16.590 --> 02:35:17.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3733
02:35:17.140 --> 02:35:18.440
<v Speaker 1>like you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you've done today,</v>

3734
02:35:18.441 --> 02:35:19.750
<v Speaker 1>several times in the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

3735
02:35:19.751 --> 02:35:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining what a concession is.</v>

3736
02:35:20.981 --> 02:35:22.210
<v Speaker 1>People don't know what a concession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's well,</v>

3737
02:35:22.211 --> 02:35:26.230
<v Speaker 1>if you can write in this certain manner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them some sort of an education</v>

3738
02:35:26.231 --> 02:35:28.810
<v Speaker 1>while you're telling them the story and</v>
<v Speaker 1>do a poetically.</v>

3739
02:35:28.811 --> 02:35:29.644
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3740
02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:31.181
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3741
02:35:31.181 --> 02:35:32.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it,</v>

3742
02:35:32.700 --> 02:35:34.600
<v Speaker 1>but there's so few people doing it that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

3743
02:35:34.900 --> 02:35:37.150
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sitka makes some really good films and</v>

3744
02:35:37.151 --> 02:35:39.070
<v Speaker 1>making some longer films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3745
02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:43.270
<v Speaker 1>they're in the 20 minutes and longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think very few people are doing</v>

3746
02:35:43.271 --> 02:35:45.820
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really making it into a movie.</v>

3747
02:35:46.030 --> 02:35:47.260
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that,</v>

3748
02:35:47.261 --> 02:35:49.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This next one will be about 90 minutes</v>

3749
02:35:49.511 --> 02:35:51.130
<v Speaker 1>in length,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm really excited about it.</v>

3750
02:35:51.250 --> 02:35:52.083
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
