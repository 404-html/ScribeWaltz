<v Speaker 1>This is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any friend of Duncan's a friend of mine.</v>

6
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.470

8
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.181
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

9
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:20.181
<v Speaker 1>so I have to ask the opening question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is it like being the son</v>

10
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 1>of Timothy Leary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opening question,</v>

11
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be the has to be.</v>

12
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:26.274
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

13
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

14
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know that the answer to the</v>

15
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>question kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's changed a lot over the course of</v>

16
00:00:34.531 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>time obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>because when I was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>

18
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really up until my mid twenties,</v>

19
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:43.310
<v Speaker 1>even my late twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say like,</v>

20
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know how to answer that</v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

21
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:47.070
<v Speaker 1>How could I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just all I knew was just life,</v>

22
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just my dad.</v>

23
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>It's just how I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:53.450
<v Speaker 1>he would take me to little league,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd make sure I did my homework or</v>

25
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>didn't do my homework in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever it was,</v>

26
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just was a life,</v>

27
00:00:57.751 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any objectivity to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any distance from it.</v>

28
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be remote from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was perhaps really strange.</v>

30
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.891
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

32
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>he died in [inaudible] 96.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 22 and then kind of after that</v>

33
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>then I sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I got some distance from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I was like,</v>

35
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:18.504
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>things were a little different at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

38
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>your dad is probably like one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most important,</v>

39
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 1>if not the most important people ever in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the psychedelic revolution.</v>

40
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

41
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My relationship with him and my</v>

42
00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:37.570
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with his work was um,</v>

43
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean of course the sexuality part was</v>

44
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>a core pillar and I understood that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what made him famous,</v>

45
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>but I considered him to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a futurist really,</v>

46
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

47
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>during my formative years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 1>the psychedelic thing was always there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was much more interested in like,</v>

49
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>in technology and cyber culture and kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like the progressive kind of</v>

50
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arts and things like that.</v>

51
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.410
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>in the eighties he called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.100
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the PC,</v>

54
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>the lsd of the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>so he was kind of really shifting and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of considered him by somebody who</v>

56
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>just had the innate ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly reinvent themselves.</v>

57
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>And of course the psychedelics were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>were the core and I guess probably is</v>
<v Speaker 1>also probably a big part of how we can</v>

59
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:22.770
<v Speaker 1>reinvent themselves.</v>

60
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

61
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.211
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

62
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:24.561
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

63
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:25.394
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

64
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

65
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.220
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and considering,</v>

66
00:02:29.221 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can relate with this I think too.</v>

67
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't do his first second delek</v>

68
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.590
<v Speaker 1>until he was 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

69
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.191
<v Speaker 1>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

70
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:36.760
<v Speaker 1>30 or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a similar,</v>

72
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:41.660
<v Speaker 1>like you're well into your adult life</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're well formed.</v>

73
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>You have an identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Jack Harris story too.</v>

74
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Jack Hara?</v>

75
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Was a goldwater republican like deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>into his,</v>

76
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:50.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

77
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I think he was getting divorced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met,</v>

78
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>met a young gal and she turned them onto</v>

79
00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>the weed and all of a sudden he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

80
00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck have I been missing?</v>

81
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's still</v>

82
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this day is still the strongest we'd</v>

83
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 2>have ever had Jack Harris trained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

84
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.010
<v Speaker 2>He was a cool guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

85
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 2>He was a bum me out when he left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

86
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 2>he did good work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your dad probably would have had an</v>

87
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:18.451
<v Speaker 2>amazing time with what's going on today</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of virtual reality and the</v>

88
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.780
<v Speaker 2>integration of cell phones into our life</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an almost inescapable way.</v>

89
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

90
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 2>it's funny like the vr thing where just</v>
<v Speaker 2>jamie and I were just talking about it</v>

91
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 2>before we rolled tape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

92
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were doing vr,</v>

93
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 2>we were at the NASA Ames research</v>
<v Speaker 2>center.</v>

95
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 2>People were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jaron Lanier.</v>

96
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 2>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

97
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:37.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

98
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>journaling.</v>

99
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 2>There was kind of the godfather of vr</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was bringing kind of setup store</v>

100
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 2>house in the early nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like really early,</v>

101
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:49.240
<v Speaker 2>kind of almost eight bit rudimentary Vr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was there.</v>

102
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.330
<v Speaker 2>So like what did that look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kind of looks like I'm being an</v>

103
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 2>inside of an Atari video game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So real pixelated,</v>

104
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 2>pixelated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight bit kind of Clunky,</v>

105
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 2>blocked like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with full three dimensionality and</v>

106
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see loved it?</v>

107
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 2>Duncan's Oculus the first day of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first versions that he had,</v>

108
00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 2>which was kind of like that real kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pixelated.</v>

109
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Was it similar to that and very similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that?</v>

110
00:04:14.381 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you had a Duncan and I went on the</v>

111
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:19.420
<v Speaker 2>show together and didn't go gunters</v>
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

112
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 2>It's Vr chat show and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was recent and you know,</v>

113
00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 2>it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vr is still kind of in that,</v>

114
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does that work?</v>

115
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:31.891
<v Speaker 2>Like does someone have a Vr headset on</v>
<v Speaker 2>another location and then you guys both</v>

116
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:34.060
<v Speaker 2>enter the same room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're in the room together.</v>

117
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.691
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

118
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 2>Well Dunk and I actually we're in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same room together.</v>

119
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.970
<v Speaker 2>We happen to be but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then all of these people with</v>

120
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:43.150
<v Speaker 2>different headsets on and then everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a different avatar and they're all</v>

121
00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:44.930
<v Speaker 2>in that room with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all in the room.</v>

122
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.200
<v Speaker 2>Was very cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very cool.</v>

123
00:04:47.201 --> 00:04:48.950
<v Speaker 2>But I like that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

124
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 2>I think the servers crashed 20 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

125
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.390
<v Speaker 2>how many people can it support?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

126
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 2>what we had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe like a thousand I think.</v>

127
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to get beyond that.</v>

128
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:00.620
<v Speaker 2>You need some Pr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the avatars,</v>

129
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty involved.</v>

130
00:05:01.761 --> 00:05:02.890
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

131
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 2>they made me into this Hari Krishna monk</v>
<v Speaker 2>or some shit,</v>

132
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.270
<v Speaker 2>like the psychedelic clown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty cool.</v>

133
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.760
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

134
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.820
<v Speaker 2>my dad load field and we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

135
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.990
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was right near.</v>

136
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 2>He'd love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be really cool.</v>

137
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always thought about him and I'm</v>

138
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Mckenna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mckenna obviously was a big futurist as</v>

139
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:26.371
<v Speaker 2>well and completely fascinated by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibilities and where technology was</v>

140
00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 2>going out of love to see those guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

141
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Just take this all in and try to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

142
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.921
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

143
00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:37.150
<v Speaker 2>Like terrence was writing about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>connection between psilocybin in virtual</v>

144
00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:37.984
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

145
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the subtext of not food,</v>

146
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:43.480
<v Speaker 2>of the gods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if I'm one of those nations,</v>

147
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:44.140
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

148
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.650
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm filing which ones,</v>

149
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.660
<v Speaker 2>what it's called mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual reality and you know,</v>

150
00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:53.470
<v Speaker 2>and he really saw the connection between</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

151
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:58.471
<v Speaker 2>there is no accident that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>godfather's the true visionaries of the</v>

152
00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 2>Silicon Valley Movement.</v>

153
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 1>We're kind of remnants from the 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>Steve Jobs,</v>

155
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 3>archaic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>revival,</v>

156
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 3>revival.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

157
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.203
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

158
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:09.790
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

159
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.390
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He also,</v>

160
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:16.391
<v Speaker 3>terrance also had this idea that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be able to recreate the DMT world</v>

161
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 3>in virtual reality and you'd be able to</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience what people see when they're</v>

162
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:26.450
<v Speaker 3>on dmt without actually taking the drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He believed that there was going to come</v>

163
00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 3>a time when technology was so good and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the images that you could create would</v>

164
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:34.970
<v Speaker 3>be so elaborate that you literally could</v>
<v Speaker 3>create the DMT images.</v>

165
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe what I'm kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of leaning there right now</v>

166
00:06:38.491 --> 00:06:39.540
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean we kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

168
00:06:41.431 --> 00:06:41.971
<v Speaker 1>Duncan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

169
00:06:41.971 --> 00:06:44.290
<v Speaker 1>we kind of had this crackpot idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a,</v>

170
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 1>a Vr into the flotation tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the float tank with this kind of in</v>

171
00:06:49.441 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 1>mind that by disassociating the body and</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of getting rid of it because you</v>

172
00:06:53.931 --> 00:06:55.710
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the big dmt thing is it's the</v>

173
00:06:55.711 --> 00:06:58.050
<v Speaker 1>disassociated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you just leave Joe,</v>

174
00:06:58.051 --> 00:07:03.051
<v Speaker 1>you leave Zach and you become whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by taking the vr masks it a headset</v>

175
00:07:04.081 --> 00:07:06.540
<v Speaker 1>into the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe combining the two worlds that</v>

176
00:07:06.541 --> 00:07:07.650
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

177
00:07:07.651 --> 00:07:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm still bullish on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it could work.</v>

178
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I think Sarah says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

179
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.273
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like</v>

180
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.830
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know crash when the float that.</v>

181
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.640
<v Speaker 3>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the float lab crash has this setup where</v>

182
00:07:17.641 --> 00:07:22.350
<v Speaker 3>he is developed a screen that has the</v>
<v Speaker 3>lowest amount of light that could be</v>

183
00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:25.680
<v Speaker 3>admitted to the point where you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>see the edges of the screen,</v>

184
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.600
<v Speaker 3>so you literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while you're in the tank,</v>

185
00:07:27.601 --> 00:07:31.470
<v Speaker 3>it's floating above your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's suspended above your head and you</v>

186
00:07:31.471 --> 00:07:36.471
<v Speaker 3>see the image as if it's like just the</v>
<v Speaker 3>video just floating in the sky.</v>

187
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he believes that by separating your</v>

188
00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:45.240
<v Speaker 3>body from a sensory input so you're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeling your feet on the ground,</v>

189
00:07:45.241 --> 00:07:47.220
<v Speaker 3>you're not feeling the weight of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world on your shoulders,</v>

190
00:07:47.221 --> 00:07:48.330
<v Speaker 3>all that jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're floating.</v>

191
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:52.110
<v Speaker 3>He thinks you could take in data better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so his idea was to show</v>

192
00:07:52.111 --> 00:07:55.560
<v Speaker 3>documentaries and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>instructionals and things along those</v>

193
00:07:55.561 --> 00:07:57.120
<v Speaker 3>lines that you would learn quicker that</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

194
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

195
00:07:58.021 --> 00:08:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because so much of your brain and the</v>

196
00:08:00.121 --> 00:08:03.480
<v Speaker 1>function of the cerebral cortex is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrate the body.</v>

197
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.430
<v Speaker 1>This movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Standing Upright,</v>

198
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being muscular and moving around.</v>

199
00:08:08.251 --> 00:08:11.520
<v Speaker 1>And if you get rid of that right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of opens up and I can take</v>

200
00:08:11.521 --> 00:08:12.130
<v Speaker 1>more in.</v>

201
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.480
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I always describe it to people</v>

202
00:08:13.481 --> 00:08:14.890
<v Speaker 3>that haven't used the tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

203
00:08:14.891 --> 00:08:16.600
<v Speaker 3>imagine if you were having a</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>

204
00:08:16.601 --> 00:08:19.560
<v Speaker 3>but next to you people were screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it was an important conversation,</v>

205
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.660
<v Speaker 3>you'd want to get away from those people</v>
<v Speaker 3>screaming because even though you think</v>

206
00:08:22.661 --> 00:08:24.430
<v Speaker 3>of it as a distraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just input.</v>

207
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.080
<v Speaker 3>It's just data that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>consider,</v>

208
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will you also have to consider your butt</v>

209
00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:30.100
<v Speaker 3>on this chair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the room,</v>

210
00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:33.970
<v Speaker 3>the dimensions that you're calculating</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you're moving your head around social</v>

211
00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:35.170
<v Speaker 3>cues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>language,</v>

212
00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:39.640
<v Speaker 3>all these different things are all being</v>
<v Speaker 3>calculated and they require resources.</v>

213
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.241
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

214
00:08:40.241 --> 00:08:42.310
<v Speaker 3>when you are in that tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's none of that.</v>

215
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.060
<v Speaker 3>And so your brain feels supercharged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels like you have all these</v>

216
00:08:46.061 --> 00:08:47.620
<v Speaker 3>resources have been opened up to you.</v>

217
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:48.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

218
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.690
<v Speaker 1>and I agree with you and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:08:50.691 --> 00:08:53.400
<v Speaker 1>all of those resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources that you're speaking of,</v>

220
00:08:53.401 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>those are sort of the things that to</v>

221
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 2>this idea of what we call the Eco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

222
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 2>and the same thing with psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

223
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:03.150
<v Speaker 2>they formulate the ego and our body and</v>
<v Speaker 2>being separate.</v>

224
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:03.901
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

225
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:04.850
<v Speaker 2>you're strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I meant,</v>

226
00:09:04.851 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just all these kinds of different things</v>

227
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 2>that create this image of who we think</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are.</v>

228
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tank meditation,</v>

229
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:16.410
<v Speaker 2>whatever method you want to pick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets rid of that and purely gets into</v>

230
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 2>soul land or something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever meet John Lilly?</v>

231
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spent a long time.</v>

232
00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:25.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

233
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Did a lot of what I've done research</v>
<v Speaker 2>with John Research air quotes back in</v>

234
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 2>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>

235
00:09:33.361 --> 00:09:34.230
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the.</v>

236
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.090
<v Speaker 2>For people who don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about the guy who</v>

237
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:40.020
<v Speaker 2>invented the sensory deprivation tank</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was a pioneer in interspecies</v>

238
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:42.900
<v Speaker 2>communication with dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

239
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.360
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating guy.</v>

240
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.660
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

241
00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:47.850
<v Speaker 2>the last 20 years of his life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

242
00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ketamine aspect was such a huge part</v>

243
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:52.970
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what he was doing and did he get to</v>

244
00:09:52.971 --> 00:09:57.420
<v Speaker 2>and do it the academy and seems to be an</v>
<v Speaker 2>addictive substance.</v>

245
00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

246
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:00.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love John.</v>

247
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.440
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was great.</v>

248
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:05.890
<v Speaker 2>It was a good friend of my dad's and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly wouldn't say anything too</v>

249
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.170
<v Speaker 2>negative about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

250
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 2>one toke over the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what Jesus Todd Mccormick has a</v>

251
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:15.150
<v Speaker 2>very funny story about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what Tom Mccormick is?</v>

252
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Todd's one of the first guys to get</v>

253
00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:22.101
<v Speaker 2>arrested in California for medical</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana where he was arrested in the</v>

254
00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:25.440
<v Speaker 2>early or the late nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early two thousands.</v>

255
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.350
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was one of the first people to find</v>

256
00:10:28.351 --> 00:10:33.351
<v Speaker 2>out that when you are legally growing</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana in California,</v>

257
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.890
<v Speaker 2>because of the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the medical law,</v>

258
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.310
<v Speaker 2>the federal government can still</v>
<v Speaker 2>prosecute you and when they prosecute</v>

259
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:39.690
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are in court.</v>

260
00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:43.800
<v Speaker 2>You are not allowed to even bring up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>term medical marijuana because that's</v>

261
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:46.830
<v Speaker 2>not a real term federally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he had,</v>

262
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.360
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a railroad here at railroad and</v>

263
00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.223
<v Speaker 2>went to jail.</v>

264
00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

265
00:10:51.571 --> 00:10:56.220
<v Speaker 2>point being he was a at John Lilly's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He actually still owns John Lilly's</v>

266
00:10:56.221 --> 00:10:57.240
<v Speaker 2>tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

267
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was with John Lilly and John</v>

268
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.151
<v Speaker 2>Lilly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

269
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:02.850
<v Speaker 2>invited him to get in the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

270
00:11:02.851 --> 00:11:04.950
<v Speaker 2>so todd's about to go into the tank and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he says,</v>

271
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.800
<v Speaker 2>do you want to do ketamine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

272
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:10.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm stepping into the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

273
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.400
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it's John Lilly,</v>

274
00:11:13.401 --> 00:11:14.260
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

275
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.780
<v Speaker 2>So he hits him with a blast of</v>
<v Speaker 2>intramuscular ketamine and the thigh and</v>

276
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:22.110
<v Speaker 2>then todd starts freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in the tank and he's freaking out.</v>

277
00:11:22.111 --> 00:11:24.780
<v Speaker 2>So John gets into another tank next to</v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

278
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.470
<v Speaker 2>blasts themself with Ketamine and goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and visits him.</v>

279
00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.800
<v Speaker 2>Glad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

280
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've found whatever.</v>

281
00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:35.970
<v Speaker 2>Same fucking dimension in the academy in</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

282
00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:37.020
<v Speaker 2>And it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

283
00:11:37.021 --> 00:11:38.580
<v Speaker 2>It work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

284
00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:40.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know because I've never done</v>
<v Speaker 2>ketamine.</v>

285
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.890
<v Speaker 2>So have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

286
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.560
<v Speaker 2>I've done it in the tank to w.</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

287
00:11:43.561 --> 00:11:44.940
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens in there?</v>

288
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been a while since I've done it in</v>

289
00:11:46.821 --> 00:11:51.300
<v Speaker 2>the tank and I'm not so sure I'd do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>again and we're going to do it again.</v>

290
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm glad I did it.</v>

291
00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God</v>

292
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.480
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

293
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.320
<v Speaker 1>you read that description of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>terence writes about,</v>

294
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 1>ketamine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>

295
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:02.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I'm going to get it exactly</v>

296
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:06.010
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Ketamine is sort of like you're</v>

297
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.810
<v Speaker 1>going inside of an office building but</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stark and there's nothing in the</v>

298
00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:13.600
<v Speaker 1>office or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's vacant.</v>

299
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

300
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>well he believed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns,</v>

301
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:21.180
<v Speaker 1>believed that when you were experiencing</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a heavy duty mushroom trip,</v>

302
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.570
<v Speaker 1>you're not just experiencing your trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're experiencing all the</v>

303
00:12:25.571 --> 00:12:27.910
<v Speaker 1>different people that have ever done</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms together.</v>

304
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.753
<v Speaker 1>Tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

305
00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.980
<v Speaker 1>which is why a lot of people when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>take psilocybin and particularly they</v>

306
00:12:32.981 --> 00:12:35.740
<v Speaker 1>get a lot of Aztec and Mayan imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

307
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:36.491
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

308
00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:37.270
<v Speaker 1>I grew up on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

309
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:38.020
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

310
00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean our,</v>

311
00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:42.860
<v Speaker 1>every single indigenous culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

312
00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:44.890
<v Speaker 1>except for the eskimos because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't grow shit.</v>

313
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.610
<v Speaker 1>But every single indigenous culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>until very reasonably,</v>

314
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:52.210
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics were a core part of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their methodology,</v>

315
00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:53.770
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their tribal rituals.</v>

316
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:55.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone's got fucked,</v>

317
00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing up there,</v>

318
00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.190
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You picked a bad spot.</v>

319
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Hit the bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giving so much fish but cut ketamine and</v>

320
00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:03.970
<v Speaker 1>the tank though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is.</v>

321
00:13:03.971 --> 00:13:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite a journey.</v>

322
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.143
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

323
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:10.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like how the best way I</v>

324
00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:14.590
<v Speaker 1>could explain it is if black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could see colors within</v>

325
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:16.930
<v Speaker 1>blackness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there were shades of black,</v>

326
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.060
<v Speaker 1>if that makes any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

327
00:13:19.061 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 1>because it's pitch black and the tank</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your head is pitch black,</v>

328
00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:27.181
<v Speaker 1>but somehow you're getting sacred</v>
<v Speaker 1>geometry and sort of kind of visions and</v>

329
00:13:29.651 --> 00:13:32.200
<v Speaker 1>kind of downloads that are in the color</v>
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>

330
00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:35.350
<v Speaker 1>if that makes any sense at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

331
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:36.363
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

332
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

333
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the great moments of my life</v>

334
00:13:40.061 --> 00:13:43.750
<v Speaker 1>actually was picked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was getting to Ketamine inside the</v>

335
00:13:43.751 --> 00:13:47.980
<v Speaker 1>tank and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tank was right outside of my dad's</v>

336
00:13:47.981 --> 00:13:52.981
<v Speaker 1>kind of sliding glass window</v>
<v Speaker 1>which went out into the lawn in his</v>

337
00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:56.470
<v Speaker 1>bedroom up in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up here in the Hollywood hills.</v>

338
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.840
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

339
00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I went in and took a little kedamine Rom</v>
<v Speaker 1>das was visiting that day,</v>

340
00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:05.320
<v Speaker 1>visiting my dad and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last time they ever saw each other</v>

341
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.050
<v Speaker 1>and he died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just my dad died just like a month</v>

342
00:14:08.051 --> 00:14:09.970
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went inside the tank.</v>

343
00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two of them were visiting right</v>

344
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.660
<v Speaker 1>outside of the tank hatch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

345
00:14:14.661 --> 00:14:18.070
<v Speaker 1>how the hatch comes out and they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know I wasn't inside a.</v>

346
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.610
<v Speaker 1>and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was lost in this whole just completely</v>

347
00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

348
00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.710
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to do?</v>

349
00:14:23.711 --> 00:14:25.480
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing I knew how to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

350
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out the hole for people who</v>

351
00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:31.900
<v Speaker 1>don't know what we're talking about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people describe the ketamine</v>

352
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.630
<v Speaker 1>experience when you're just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck and stuck in life.</v>

353
00:14:35.631 --> 00:14:38.290
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like code red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ejected the eject button,</v>

354
00:14:38.291 --> 00:14:42.210
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I popped open the hatch and you know,</v>

355
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.810
<v Speaker 1>my dad and Ron doss are sending us close</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you and I right now are right now and</v>

356
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with self referential enough to know</v>

357
00:14:49.631 --> 00:14:50.231
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh wow,</v>

358
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:52.160
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two of them sitting</v>

359
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.070
<v Speaker 2>here right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wasn't stupid and you're naked</v>

360
00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 2>and you're tripping and tripping on</v>
<v Speaker 2>academy and everyone is just completely</v>

361
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:01.220
<v Speaker 2>silent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stare at each other.</v>

362
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:05.390
<v Speaker 2>And Rom Dastis leans into me and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are you now?</v>

363
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Although,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was kind of like a defining</v>

364
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:11.720
<v Speaker 2>moment in my life journey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life,</v>

365
00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.470
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you now fog?</v>

366
00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.710
<v Speaker 2>Kind of my mantra</v>
<v Speaker 2>for life now.</v>

367
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.680
<v Speaker 2>But that was over 20 years ago now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

368
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:25.280
<v Speaker 2>So did you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that the last time you did it in the</v>

369
00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:27.520
<v Speaker 2>tank?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

370
00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.300
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a glutton for punishment.</v>

371
00:15:29.301 --> 00:15:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did do it one other time after that.</v>

372
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is it particularly about the k</v>

373
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:35.970
<v Speaker 2>hole?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you,</v>

374
00:15:35.971 --> 00:15:37.640
<v Speaker 2>when you go into what they call a k</v>
<v Speaker 2>hole?</v>

375
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Like I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard it described by people who</v>

376
00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:41.660
<v Speaker 2>were like recreational users.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

377
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't call them psychonauts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're more like,</v>

378
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people go to raves and stuff.</v>

379
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.620
<v Speaker 2>It's dark man and stark and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite get it.</v>

380
00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't get the ketamine in the public</v>
<v Speaker 2>rave setting at.</v>

381
00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.120
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

382
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:55.460
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John loved it.</v>

383
00:15:55.461 --> 00:15:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Lily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

384
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.290
<v Speaker 2>He did loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ketamine.</v>

385
00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Yuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why was that his thing?</v>

386
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Like what did he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was his raves about it?</v>

387
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean he just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

388
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.283
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

389
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:10.220
<v Speaker 2>to understand that relationship is also</v>
<v Speaker 2>into understand John a little bit in the</v>

390
00:16:10.221 --> 00:16:11.450
<v Speaker 2>sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

391
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was the guy who said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

392
00:16:13.341 --> 00:16:15.500
<v Speaker 2>my body is my laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

393
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was,</v>

394
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one point he gave himself a boob</v>

395
00:16:18.681 --> 00:16:19.670
<v Speaker 2>implant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

396
00:16:19.671 --> 00:16:23.060
<v Speaker 2>He was way out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do you use for the boob</v>

397
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:24.610
<v Speaker 2>implant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't know,</v>

398
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:28.240
<v Speaker 2>like the ones that are standard ones</v>
<v Speaker 2>that women get silicone or whatever.</v>

399
00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:31.500
<v Speaker 2>Did he give himself one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only one to really.</v>

400
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:36.330
<v Speaker 2>So he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were some darkness involved there and</v>

401
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.240
<v Speaker 2>did he try to make them look like</v>
<v Speaker 2>women's breasts?</v>

402
00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

403
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I recall,</v>

404
00:16:41.271 --> 00:16:43.570
<v Speaker 2>you have found a picture of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we could find,</v>

405
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he lose a bet or is it just like,</v>

406
00:16:47.361 --> 00:16:49.760
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to have breast implants.</v>

407
00:16:49.761 --> 00:16:52.880
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body is my laboratory now and sort of</v>

408
00:16:52.881 --> 00:16:54.620
<v Speaker 2>just the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean at that time,</v>

409
00:16:54.621 --> 00:16:57.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean now what does being gender fluid</v>
<v Speaker 2>is such a,</v>

410
00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could talk about that.</v>

411
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.410
<v Speaker 2>That's really gender fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know that's one of the things about</v>

412
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.190
<v Speaker 2>breast implants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like at the end of the day everyone</v>

413
00:17:07.191 --> 00:17:09.110
<v Speaker 2>knows what the fuck that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this,</v>

414
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.370
<v Speaker 2>there's this weird sort of suspension of</v>
<v Speaker 2>disbelief where we're looking at these</v>

415
00:17:13.371 --> 00:17:16.460
<v Speaker 2>water bags that are surgically stuffed</v>
<v Speaker 2>under your skin and we're just</v>

416
00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:21.461
<v Speaker 2>pretending this is like he's your sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>organs that are plump and ripe on the</v>

417
00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:23.180
<v Speaker 2>vine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not,</v>

418
00:17:23.181 --> 00:17:25.460
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the weirdest things about</v>

419
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:27.920
<v Speaker 2>like being a tripper and deciding to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

420
00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:28.301
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

421
00:17:28.301 --> 00:17:30.440
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're violating a lot of like bizarre</v>

422
00:17:30.441 --> 00:17:32.180
<v Speaker 2>paradigms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

423
00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:36.560
<v Speaker 2>but I mean he was also kind of bending</v>
<v Speaker 2>the paradigm and kind of bending the</v>

424
00:17:36.561 --> 00:17:37.700
<v Speaker 2>idea of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

425
00:17:37.701 --> 00:17:41.150
<v Speaker 2>you can be anything this time around if</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be helpful and when it could</v>

426
00:17:41.151 --> 00:17:42.260
<v Speaker 2>be half women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do that.</v>

427
00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:45.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm a doctor in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're living in this golden age of being</v>

428
00:17:45.141 --> 00:17:49.920
<v Speaker 2>able to morph yourself into whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you can imagine kind of thing.</v>

429
00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if numbers early too,</v>

430
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.510
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of those guys that trips so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>

431
00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:59.070
<v Speaker 2>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a least for practical purposes.</v>

432
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:02.430
<v Speaker 2>We would all like to think that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>would like to have a psychedelic</v>

433
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:05.610
<v Speaker 2>experience and then come back down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth and be able to,</v>

434
00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:07.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make use of that in the real world.</v>

435
00:18:07.411 --> 00:18:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Like it can kind of benefit you in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>real world.</v>

436
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.403
<v Speaker 2>That's the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

437
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:11.940
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

438
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:14.820
<v Speaker 2>so why should we impart those standards</v>
<v Speaker 2>on anybody?</v>

439
00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:16.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do whatever you want,</v>

440
00:18:16.291 --> 00:18:21.030
<v Speaker 2>but I think some guys like lily is</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a prime example that people use</v>

441
00:18:21.031 --> 00:18:25.650
<v Speaker 2>as a point of reference went so far</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's like where's the baseline</v>

442
00:18:25.651 --> 00:18:27.330
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no baseline for him</v>

443
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:29.220
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just so out there.</v>

444
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:30.750
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>

445
00:18:30.751 --> 00:18:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

446
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:33.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

447
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:36.660
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you and also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean not to,</v>

448
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:40.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use you as a,</v>

449
00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.350
<v Speaker 2>it's a great model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're a great poster child for</v>

450
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.690
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelic stuff as my dad was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

451
00:18:45.691 --> 00:18:46.560
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

452
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:50.610
<v Speaker 2>you're well into your adult life and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed your consciousness and you're</v>

453
00:18:50.611 --> 00:18:54.260
<v Speaker 2>able to apply it to your work to what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do and you know,</v>

454
00:18:54.261 --> 00:18:56.220
<v Speaker 2>and it's become very fluid and very</v>
<v Speaker 2>integrated.</v>

455
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.240
<v Speaker 2>You don't hide it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

456
00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:58.590
<v Speaker 2>you're public about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

457
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:02.640
<v Speaker 2>you found a way to integrate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the idea of spiritual</v>

458
00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:05.160
<v Speaker 2>practices and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about integration and I think it's</v>

459
00:19:05.161 --> 00:19:10.161
<v Speaker 2>important to not hide it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think if there's much more fear of</v>

460
00:19:10.411 --> 00:19:13.190
<v Speaker 2>repercussions than actual repercussions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

461
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.750
<v Speaker 2>I think Terence Mckenna had a great</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

462
00:19:15.751 --> 00:19:17.970
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too many people are doing the man's work</v>

463
00:19:17.971 --> 00:19:22.320
<v Speaker 2>for the man race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't really care if you're</v>

464
00:19:22.321 --> 00:19:25.350
<v Speaker 2>out doing mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what they're trying to do is</v>

465
00:19:25.351 --> 00:19:30.351
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to stop large scale sales</v>
<v Speaker 2>and distribution of schedule one drugs.</v>

466
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.940
<v Speaker 2>They're not trying to stop some dude</v>
<v Speaker 2>from doing mushrooms.</v>

467
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And look what we're seeing with</v>

468
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:39.180
<v Speaker 2>microdosing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>valley,</v>

469
00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:43.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean more and more people are kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out of the closet and you know,</v>

470
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:47.850
<v Speaker 2>supposedly what the names that are kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of attached to the rumor mill of who's</v>

471
00:19:47.851 --> 00:19:49.350
<v Speaker 2>doing micro dosing in Silicon Valley.</v>

472
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:50.730
<v Speaker 2>It's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

473
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:52.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

474
00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.520
<v Speaker 2>that's really insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

475
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:57.060
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think as marijuana is now legal in</v>

476
00:19:57.061 --> 00:20:00.870
<v Speaker 2>the state and it becomes legal in more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more states and hopefully one day</v>

477
00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:05.520
<v Speaker 2>it'll be released from the schedule one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just so crazy that the dea</v>

478
00:20:05.521 --> 00:20:09.690
<v Speaker 2>decided to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They mean they got to the door this past</v>

479
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.760
<v Speaker 2>summer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did and then they decided to pull</v>

480
00:20:11.761 --> 00:20:15.540
<v Speaker 2>away and just keep it at schedule one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means there's no medical benefit,</v>

481
00:20:15.541 --> 00:20:17.440
<v Speaker 2>which is a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it.</v>

482
00:20:17.441 --> 00:20:22.110
<v Speaker 2>And that's especially fucked and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of down on Obama for that as much</v>

483
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.870
<v Speaker 2>as i.</v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of Obama I really do admire.</v>

484
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.030
<v Speaker 2>But that I think was an epic failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And considering,</v>

485
00:20:27.031 --> 00:20:30.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just parked in 158 guys.</v>

486
00:20:30.001 --> 00:20:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Most of them are nonviolent drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>offenders and the two are synonymous,</v>

487
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.861
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

488
00:20:34.861 --> 00:20:36.480
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you treated the symptom man,</v>

489
00:20:36.481 --> 00:20:37.170
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

490
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you really those guys from</v>
<v Speaker 2>prison and good for you,</v>

491
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:43.050
<v Speaker 2>but treat the fucking disease man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you got to treat.</v>

492
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.290
<v Speaker 2>And now where as we're stepping into</v>
<v Speaker 2>this dark age,</v>

493
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm calling it a dark age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the trump dark age of dark</v>

494
00:20:51.401 --> 00:20:51.881
<v Speaker 2>age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

495
00:20:51.881 --> 00:20:53.190
<v Speaker 2>it's not good for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

496
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.280
<v Speaker 2>for these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

497
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:57.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it is or it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what the problem is that when you</v>

498
00:20:57.521 --> 00:21:01.450
<v Speaker 2>know something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you and I know what's dangerous</v>

499
00:21:01.451 --> 00:21:03.520
<v Speaker 2>and what's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like math is dangerous.</v>

500
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.810
<v Speaker 2>Dangerous marijuana is on dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>

501
00:21:06.811 --> 00:21:10.090
<v Speaker 2>when you look at all the facts and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at all the absolutely proven</v>

502
00:21:10.091 --> 00:21:14.260
<v Speaker 2>medical benefits and then you see that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're denying the existence of these</v>

503
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:15.094
<v Speaker 2>yet go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

504
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:18.250
<v Speaker 2>well the people that are in control of</v>
<v Speaker 2>locking people up and throw them in the</v>

505
00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:20.400
<v Speaker 2>jail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're a bunch of liars because they're</v>

506
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.730
<v Speaker 2>just ignoring the science.</v>

507
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.940
<v Speaker 2>There had an the research and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>research that's gone back to the 19</v>

508
00:21:24.941 --> 00:21:29.941
<v Speaker 2>seventies at the Nixon administration</v>
<v Speaker 2>paid for and then ignored and now I</v>

509
00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.560
<v Speaker 2>think the bar was even raised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

510
00:21:32.561 --> 00:21:35.950
<v Speaker 2>CBD is just cutting thrown into that</v>
<v Speaker 2>really recently,</v>

511
00:21:35.951 --> 00:21:38.620
<v Speaker 2>which is just a really sneaky thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>because cbd,</v>

512
00:21:38.621 --> 00:21:42.580
<v Speaker 2>much like hemp has zero psychoactive</v>
<v Speaker 2>properties.</v>

513
00:21:42.581 --> 00:21:45.970
<v Speaker 2>It's not doing anything to alter your</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness in terms of getting you</v>

514
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:49.480
<v Speaker 2>high and dry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does amazing stuff for reducing</v>

515
00:21:49.481 --> 00:21:51.760
<v Speaker 2>inflammation for people that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>arthritis.</v>

516
00:21:51.761 --> 00:21:54.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a like a lifesaver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

517
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing I could kind of in this</v>

518
00:21:57.191 --> 00:21:59.560
<v Speaker 2>thread is kind of think about and talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about is,</v>

519
00:21:59.561 --> 00:22:01.840
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what is,</v>

520
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the reason behind this?</v>

521
00:22:03.341 --> 00:22:07.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you kind of isolate big Pharma</v>
<v Speaker 2>and talk about that and then,</v>

522
00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:11.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the CBD industry,</v>

523
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:12.660
<v Speaker 2>they're big farmers.</v>

524
00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:13.503
<v Speaker 2>The enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

525
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also have to just kind of say that</v>

526
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.140
<v Speaker 2>big Pharma's main goal is to make money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

527
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.290
<v Speaker 2>to create products that make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter what the product is,</v>

528
00:22:23.291 --> 00:22:27.460
<v Speaker 2>if they told you that you know a plastic</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to alleviate cancer,</v>

529
00:22:27.461 --> 00:22:28.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would make a plastic pill,</v>

530
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:33.160
<v Speaker 2>but so what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is the enemy within this that is</v>

531
00:22:33.161 --> 00:22:37.840
<v Speaker 2>making things like cbd and marrow like</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this just kind of left over from kind</v>

532
00:22:37.841 --> 00:22:39.640
<v Speaker 2>of baby boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paranoia,</v>

533
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:43.900
<v Speaker 2>kind of narrow consciousness that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't possibly allow these substances</v>

534
00:22:43.901 --> 00:22:45.820
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fix us,</v>

535
00:22:45.821 --> 00:22:46.690
<v Speaker 2>to help us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

536
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:49.120
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's tremendous profit</v>

537
00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:53.800
<v Speaker 2>potential so something isn't in</v>
<v Speaker 2>alignment to where the depths that can't</v>

538
00:22:53.801 --> 00:22:56.110
<v Speaker 2>be controlled like Viagra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's hard.</v>

539
00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.860
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to make Viagra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you and I wanted to go into the</v>

540
00:22:59.861 --> 00:23:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Viagra business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who would have to find out what the key</v>

541
00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:04.340
<v Speaker 2>ingredients are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd have to set up a plant and</v>

542
00:23:04.341 --> 00:23:05.174
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing.</v>

543
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.200
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to go into CBD business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just have to grow some weed.</v>

544
00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not hard at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

545
00:23:10.331 --> 00:23:15.250
<v Speaker 2>So there's a big difference between</v>
<v Speaker 2>extracting cbd or especially medical</v>

546
00:23:15.251 --> 00:23:16.590
<v Speaker 2>marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like giving talks.</v>

547
00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:18.820
<v Speaker 2>If you talk about just thc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

548
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:21.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like cooking it down to a candy form or</v>

549
00:23:21.491 --> 00:23:23.680
<v Speaker 2>a pill form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not hard at all.</v>

550
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would like Glaxo Smith Kline,</v>

551
00:23:26.321 --> 00:23:27.630
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

552
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.240
<v Speaker 2>put a billion dollars into making the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best cbd pill and putting it on the</v>

553
00:23:31.241 --> 00:23:35.140
<v Speaker 2>story of every writing the shelf of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>rewrite it and kind of get the</v>

554
00:23:35.141 --> 00:23:36.680
<v Speaker 2>propaganda out there about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

555
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.070
<v Speaker 2>what it can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>propaganda being a good thing,</v>

556
00:23:39.071 --> 00:23:41.320
<v Speaker 2>getting the marketing out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of its benefits.</v>

557
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.650
<v Speaker 2>So what is stopping that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just can't copyright it.</v>

558
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 2>They can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not patentable,</v>

559
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.900
<v Speaker 3>not patentable or it's nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

560
00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:49.700
<v Speaker 3>it would be like trying to patent</v>
<v Speaker 3>oranges.</v>

561
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Like you really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do it.</v>

562
00:23:51.591 --> 00:23:53.720
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are all going to be able to grow</v>

563
00:23:53.721 --> 00:23:54.620
<v Speaker 3>oranges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

564
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.440
<v Speaker 3>And when it comes to cbd oil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone in this room can grow some</v>

565
00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:04.470
<v Speaker 3>marijuana and extract the CBD from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not an incredibly difficult.</v>

566
00:24:04.891 --> 00:24:08.270
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't require massive resources</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it would if you were gonna make</v>

567
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.480
<v Speaker 3>certain types of Alzheimer's medication</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would be.</v>

568
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:14.390
<v Speaker 3>Or Parkinson's medication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could say it would be competing with</v>

569
00:24:14.391 --> 00:24:16.580
<v Speaker 3>the CBD oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are very difficult to get and if</v>

570
00:24:16.581 --> 00:24:20.810
<v Speaker 3>you can lock down the doctors and make</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure that they only prescribe these</v>

571
00:24:20.811 --> 00:24:24.170
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical drugs that you guys can</v>
<v Speaker 3>profit from and you're the only ones</v>

572
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:26.690
<v Speaker 3>that can make it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you've got that business locked.</v>

573
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.220
<v Speaker 3>There have been people that have done</v>
<v Speaker 3>calculations about all of the different</v>

574
00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:36.460
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical drugs that would be</v>
<v Speaker 3>useless or would be unnecessary,</v>

575
00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:39.680
<v Speaker 3>should say if marijuana was legal and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty staggering.</v>

576
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.710
<v Speaker 3>It's a long list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge list and the amount of</v>

577
00:24:42.711 --> 00:24:46.520
<v Speaker 3>profit that the people who make those</v>
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical drugs would lose if</v>

578
00:24:46.521 --> 00:24:49.580
<v Speaker 3>marijuana became legal and people just</v>
<v Speaker 3>started realizing like,</v>

579
00:24:49.581 --> 00:24:50.680
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

580
00:24:50.681 --> 00:24:52.490
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the other benefits,</v>

581
00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:57.350
<v Speaker 3>like there's no drugs that are like</v>
<v Speaker 3>pharmaceutical drugs that also open you</v>

582
00:24:57.351 --> 00:24:59.090
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make you a nicer person,</v>

583
00:24:59.091 --> 00:25:02.030
<v Speaker 3>make you more friendly and commune and</v>
<v Speaker 3>make me more contemplate of,</v>

584
00:25:02.031 --> 00:25:06.350
<v Speaker 3>of your existence a sort of give you a</v>
<v Speaker 3>different perspective that's almost</v>

585
00:25:06.351 --> 00:25:08.330
<v Speaker 3>unattainable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Without those pharmaceutical.</v>

586
00:25:08.331 --> 00:25:10.610
<v Speaker 3>This isn't really right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that they don't have those</v>

587
00:25:10.611 --> 00:25:13.250
<v Speaker 3>additional benefits that the pot does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

588
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.680
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is oftentimes why it's referred to</v>

589
00:25:15.681 --> 00:25:17.650
<v Speaker 3>as a war on consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

590
00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.190
<v Speaker 3>it's got gotta be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

591
00:25:19.191 --> 00:25:22.190
<v Speaker 3>that's absolutely what it is because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not about drugs because there's so</v>

592
00:25:22.191 --> 00:25:24.320
<v Speaker 3>many drugs that are illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

593
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.270
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we cannot say there is a war on drugs</v>

594
00:25:26.271 --> 00:25:29.000
<v Speaker 3>when we can go buy a bottle of whiskey</v>
<v Speaker 3>and get a prescription for oxycontin.</v>

595
00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.030
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

596
00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.160
<v Speaker 3>In every restaurant you could buy booze</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much every restaurant.</v>

597
00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.620
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean look what the Oxycontin</v>

598
00:25:36.621 --> 00:25:38.120
<v Speaker 3>epidemic has done to America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

599
00:25:38.121 --> 00:25:40.760
<v Speaker 3>it's decimated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's created a whole generation of</v>

600
00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 3>addicts sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

601
00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:44.150
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a dangerous drugs.</v>

602
00:25:44.151 --> 00:25:46.580
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gotten so warren consciousness.</v>

603
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:47.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

604
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:52.580
<v Speaker 3>And it's really a war for profit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for controlling the ability to profit</v>

605
00:25:53.001 --> 00:25:55.640
<v Speaker 3>off of people altering their</v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness because people been,</v>

606
00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:58.010
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other than people that live in frozen</v>

607
00:25:58.011 --> 00:26:00.680
<v Speaker 3>places where nothing grows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've been trying to alter their</v>

608
00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:02.510
<v Speaker 3>consciousness forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

609
00:26:02.511 --> 00:26:04.410
<v Speaker 3>But do you believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

610
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what you're a conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 3>level kind of meter is,</v>

611
00:26:07.101 --> 00:26:10.240
<v Speaker 3>but do you believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like with all of this said,</v>

612
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:13.640
<v Speaker 3>that there is still kind of a secret</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of conspiracy,</v>

613
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:18.670
<v Speaker 3>government sanctioned funnel that allows</v>
<v Speaker 3>the illegal drug market to still</v>

614
00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.060
<v Speaker 3>flourish in some way in order to keep</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain,</v>

615
00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:24.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

616
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.680
<v Speaker 3>law enforcement endorsement in order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

617
00:26:27.681 --> 00:26:31.770
<v Speaker 3>maybe skimming off the top off of piles</v>
<v Speaker 3>of cocaine that are coming from Bolivia,</v>

618
00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:33.230
<v Speaker 3>whatever the case may be.</v>

619
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:34.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what a case study is,</v>

620
00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:38.990
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's still so many coming in</v>

621
00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.080
<v Speaker 3>and it's certainly something to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>considered when you.</v>

622
00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:46.460
<v Speaker 3>Are you aware that CIA drug plane that</v>
<v Speaker 3>crashed the jet that had visited</v>

623
00:26:46.831 --> 00:26:51.090
<v Speaker 3>Guantanamo Bay a couple of times and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>crashed in Mexico with tons of cocaine</v>

624
00:26:51.091 --> 00:26:52.260

<v Speaker 3>See if he could pull that up.</v>

626
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.290
<v Speaker 3>CIA plane crashes in Mexico with tons of</v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine.</v>

627
00:26:58.291 --> 00:27:03.260
<v Speaker 3>They overloaded their plane and they had</v>
<v Speaker 3>so much cocaine in it that they,</v>

628
00:27:03.261 --> 00:27:05.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had to a refuel and they tried to</v>

629
00:27:05.971 --> 00:27:08.280
<v Speaker 3>land in Mexico and Mexico is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

630
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.780
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>CIA.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is just last month,</v>

633
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:20.550
<v Speaker 3>a couple months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>September 16th.</v>

634
00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:21.403
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

635
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:22.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a recent one,</v>

636
00:27:22.711 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 3>but it's happened a gang of times.</v>

637
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.681
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Eight years ago,</v>

639
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.740
<v Speaker 3>saying eight years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>cocaine.</v>

642
00:27:36.301 --> 00:27:39.810
<v Speaker 3>The event in the aftermath changed</v>
<v Speaker 3>forever and official narrative of the</v>

643
00:27:39.811 --> 00:27:43.650
<v Speaker 3>war on drugs has for years been pushing</v>
<v Speaker 3>the notion that there is no significant</v>

644
00:27:43.651 --> 00:27:47.970
<v Speaker 3>American involvement in the global drug</v>
<v Speaker 3>trade and no American drug lords.</v>

645
00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.130
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You'd go down to South America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fly drugs and there's photos with him,</v>

650
00:28:02.491 --> 00:28:06.360
<v Speaker 3>with all the CIA guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he'd be partying with Noriega down</v>

651
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:08.820
<v Speaker 3>in Panama,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Panama,</v>

670
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.000
<v Speaker 3>killed himself a few years ago,</v>

671
00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.530
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael was the guy that exposed that.</v>

672
00:29:07.531 --> 00:29:09.780
<v Speaker 3>He was a Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a detective.</v>

673
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:11.880
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

674
00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:17.140
<v Speaker 3>it was a very famous moment where</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Rupert is addressing the court</v>

675
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.430
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

678
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:30.380
<v Speaker 3>I have personally witnessed the CIA</v>
<v Speaker 3>selling drugs in,</v>

679
00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.490
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in central Los Angeles,</v>

680
00:29:32.491 --> 00:29:35.040
<v Speaker 3>in south central Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen that.</v>

681
00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:36.400
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you could find that Jamie's,</v>

682
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:41.130
<v Speaker 3>it's a fucking crazy video.</v>

684
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:46.120
<v Speaker 2>He was depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had,</v>

685
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had some pretty significant depression</v>

686
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.950
<v Speaker 2>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

687
00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:55.980
<v Speaker 2>you being on the police force and all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that he had to deal with and</v>

688
00:29:56.891 --> 00:29:59.870
<v Speaker 2>trying to expose corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But listen to this [inaudible] go</v>

689
00:29:59.871 --> 00:30:01.270
<v Speaker 2>fullscreen and crank up the volume</v>

690
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.030
<v Speaker 4>because a former Los Angeles police,</v>
<v Speaker 4>narcotics detective that the agency has</v>

691
00:30:05.031 --> 00:30:06.500

00:30:13.921 --> 00:30:17.880
<v Speaker 5>This is on cspan and this is something</v>
<v Speaker 5>completely unexpected.</v>

695
00:30:17.881 --> 00:30:21.750
<v Speaker 5>So when he stood up in front of these</v>
<v Speaker 5>people and said that to the CEO,</v>

696
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.430
<v Speaker 5>pull that up against.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Please take your time.</v>

707
00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:12.150
<v Speaker 4>Is there another role?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Specific Agency operations known as a</v>

708
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:18.480
<v Speaker 4>Pegasus and watchtower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have watchtower documents heavily</v>

709
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.350
<v Speaker 4>redacted by the agency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was personally exposed to CIA</v>

710
00:31:22.351 --> 00:31:26.310
<v Speaker 4>operations and recruited by CIA</v>
<v Speaker 4>personnel who attempted to recruit me in</v>

711
00:31:26.311 --> 00:31:30.570
<v Speaker 4>the late seventies to become involved in</v>
<v Speaker 4>protecting agency drunk operations in</v>

712
00:31:30.571 --> 00:31:33.000
<v Speaker 4>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have been trying to get this out for</v>

713
00:31:33.001 --> 00:31:35.100
<v Speaker 4>18 years and I have the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My question,</v>

714
00:31:35.101 --> 00:31:36.510
<v Speaker 4>if he was very specific,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sir.</v>

715
00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.800
<v Speaker 4>If in the course of the igs</v>
<v Speaker 4>investigations and Fred hits his work,</v>

716
00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.790
<v Speaker 4>you'll come across evidence of severely</v>
<v Speaker 4>criminal activity.</v>

717
00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:47.340
<v Speaker 4>It's classified.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

718
00:31:47.341 --> 00:31:51.000
<v Speaker 4>you use that classification to hide the</v>
<v Speaker 4>criminal activity or will you tell the</v>

719
00:31:51.001 --> 00:31:52.140
<v Speaker 4>American people the truth?</v>

720
00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:00.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he went through a lot with</v>

721
00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:04.590
<v Speaker 2>and with many other things and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided at one point in time he's</v>

722
00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:07.780
<v Speaker 2>suffering too much and took his own man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

723
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:09.130
<v Speaker 2>it's really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

724
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.660
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

725
00:32:10.661 --> 00:32:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I try not to be a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm pretty open minded,</v>

726
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hopeful guy.</v>

727
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.190
<v Speaker 2>But with what we're kind of moving in</v>
<v Speaker 2>towards with the next administration,</v>

728
00:32:21.191 --> 00:32:25.050
<v Speaker 2>I just mean you know about the what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on in the Philippines with that</v>

729
00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:26.020
<v Speaker 2>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

730
00:32:26.021 --> 00:32:29.230
<v Speaker 2>The crazy drug policy and what trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>called him,</v>

731
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was president elect.</v>

732
00:32:31.181 --> 00:32:33.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see that they spoke and he took,</v>

733
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.830
<v Speaker 2>congratulate them for winning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for killing people.</v>

734
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.250
<v Speaker 2>And I guess trump said on the call that</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

735
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.340
<v Speaker 2>congratulations on this drug policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be working.</v>

736
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just assassinating people either</v>

737
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:48.340
<v Speaker 2>just killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>

738
00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.020
<v Speaker 2>He's talked pretty openly about how he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just assassinated.</v>

739
00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.160
<v Speaker 2>Just drug addicts and users just killing</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug addicts.</v>

740
00:32:55.161 --> 00:32:58.400
<v Speaker 2>That is the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something that happens when you</v>

741
00:32:58.401 --> 00:33:03.401
<v Speaker 2>have so many people in one area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the Philippines is thousands of</v>

742
00:33:03.861 --> 00:33:08.510
<v Speaker 2>islands for people who don't know and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're jammed up with people and I</v>

743
00:33:08.511 --> 00:33:11.510
<v Speaker 2>think when you have a lot of crime and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of people,</v>

744
00:33:11.511 --> 00:33:15.980
<v Speaker 2>you tend to value those people less and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just becomes.</v>

745
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Especially when you're a dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean essentially that guy's a</v>

746
00:33:21.141 --> 00:33:21.831
<v Speaker 2>dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

747
00:33:21.831 --> 00:33:22.461
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

748
00:33:22.461 --> 00:33:25.870
<v Speaker 2>whether he's elected or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said what he's doing is Barbera</v>

749
00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:30.620
<v Speaker 2>fucking assassinating people have value</v>
<v Speaker 2>people less just based on kind of</v>

750
00:33:30.621 --> 00:33:32.870
<v Speaker 2>economic on class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a class struggle,</v>

751
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:36.770
<v Speaker 2>class struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also just the sheer volume of them</v>

752
00:33:36.771 --> 00:33:39.260
<v Speaker 2>they're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not as valuable if there's,</v>

753
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:42.710
<v Speaker 2>it's like Norway or smaller population</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>

754
00:33:42.711 --> 00:33:44.810
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just value the people more.</v>

755
00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:46.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Use Norway's an example.</v>

756
00:33:46.461 --> 00:33:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

757
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.920
<v Speaker 2>it's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

758
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.730
<v Speaker 2>all the Scandinavian countries are good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

759
00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:52.040
<v Speaker 2>did you see the house we live in?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that,</v>

760
00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:53.870
<v Speaker 2>the documentary of war and drugs</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary?</v>

761
00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:54.730
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say that.</v>

762
00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:55.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it did.</v>

763
00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.750
<v Speaker 2>It did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that about five years ago?</v>

764
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about four or five years ago in so many</v>

765
00:33:59.001 --> 00:34:00.630
<v Speaker 2>of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember them all anymore.</v>

766
00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:01.960
<v Speaker 2>So many of them now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

767
00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.530
<v Speaker 2>it's a really good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

768
00:34:03.531 --> 00:34:05.820
<v Speaker 2>basically like it comes up the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

769
00:34:05.821 --> 00:34:09.500
<v Speaker 2>the final hypothesis is that the war on</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>

770
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.170
<v Speaker 2>it's a class war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

771
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:16.100
<v Speaker 2>originally we thought it was a race war</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's still partially true,</v>

772
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 2>you know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's the guy,</v>

773
00:34:18.561 --> 00:34:19.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

774
00:34:19.761 --> 00:34:23.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first drugs are from the forties and</v>

775
00:34:23.331 --> 00:34:24.650
<v Speaker 2>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm forgetting his name,</v>

776
00:34:24.651 --> 00:34:27.230
<v Speaker 2>Adelson or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who,</v>

777
00:34:27.231 --> 00:34:27.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

778
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:32.350
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he turned marijuana hysteria in a</v>

779
00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.840
<v Speaker 2>Mexican hysteria that they were bringing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in and this was in the thirties and</v>

780
00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:39.530
<v Speaker 2>forties and created reefer madness than</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin was kind of pushed into the</v>

781
00:34:39.531 --> 00:34:39.950
<v Speaker 2>ghetto.</v>

782
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:41.780
<v Speaker 2>And Rick Ross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harry anslinger.</v>

783
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

784
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I then crack brought into the ghetto and</v>

785
00:34:44.931 --> 00:34:47.540
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meth sort of becomes the exception</v>

786
00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:51.530
<v Speaker 2>because math is primarily a white</v>
<v Speaker 2>trailer park,</v>

787
00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:56.270
<v Speaker 2>sort of trashy kind of thing and know</v>
<v Speaker 2>how racist I know how racist that was</v>

788
00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.420
<v Speaker 2>politically incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

789
00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:00.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's true though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

790
00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.181
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

791
00:35:01.181 --> 00:35:04.790
<v Speaker 2>and so we kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do have a class struggle even then</v>

792
00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.000
<v Speaker 2>that's a class issue as well and it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens to be Caucasian,</v>

793
00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.060
<v Speaker 2>but exactly poor people who really get</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the math,</v>

794
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.520
<v Speaker 2>poor people disenfranchise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disenfranchised,</v>

795
00:35:13.521 --> 00:35:14.630
<v Speaker 2>unspoken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unheard of.</v>

796
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:17.000
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's definitely you could say</v>

797
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.430
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the war on drugs as a class war,</v>

798
00:35:19.431 --> 00:35:21.110
<v Speaker 2>it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's also like where can they</v>

799
00:35:21.111 --> 00:35:22.820
<v Speaker 2>extract the money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where can they get the money?</v>

800
00:35:22.821 --> 00:35:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dea has to,</v>

801
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.480
<v Speaker 2>they have to keep people employed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

802
00:35:26.481 --> 00:35:28.910
<v Speaker 2>and the way to keep people employed is</v>
<v Speaker 2>justify their job.</v>

803
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:31.940
<v Speaker 2>The way that justify their job is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>continue making arrests and show that</v>

804
00:35:31.941 --> 00:35:34.400
<v Speaker 2>you need to make arrests and show you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to have laws in place,</v>

805
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:37.380
<v Speaker 2>which is why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that prison guards will,</v>

806
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.050
<v Speaker 2>will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will lobby to make sure that marijuana</v>

807
00:35:40.051 --> 00:35:44.100
<v Speaker 2>stays illegal and other drugs are</v>
<v Speaker 2>strictly enforced.</v>

808
00:35:44.101 --> 00:35:46.800
<v Speaker 2>That the policies are strictly enforced</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so they can continue keeping their</v>

809
00:35:46.801 --> 00:35:48.180
<v Speaker 2>jobs right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

810
00:35:48.181 --> 00:35:49.710
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when we still,</v>

811
00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:51.840
<v Speaker 2>like Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the Obama administration,</v>

812
00:35:51.841 --> 00:35:55.200
<v Speaker 2>he did the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took the crack cocaine versus powder</v>

813
00:35:55.201 --> 00:35:55.810
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

814
00:35:55.810 --> 00:36:00.030
<v Speaker 2>the discrepancies from 1:20 to one and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got it down to whatever it is,</v>

815
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.450
<v Speaker 2>eight to one or something so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still Insane.</v>

816
00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Still saying it's the same drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the same drought,</v>

817
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:08.100
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's purely based on class and race,</v>

818
00:36:08.101 --> 00:36:09.130
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

819
00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:10.410
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is just,</v>

820
00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:13.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean clearly now,</v>

821
00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:15.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we've seen it and as the rhetoric</v>

822
00:36:15.811 --> 00:36:18.780
<v Speaker 2>that's been going on in the last year</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the election cycle,</v>

823
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.680
<v Speaker 2>it's a much bigger problem than we</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought it was.</v>

824
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:23.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always knew,</v>

825
00:36:23.851 --> 00:36:27.420
<v Speaker 2>we always knew that this was a problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>race and class and stuff,</v>

826
00:36:27.421 --> 00:36:29.130
<v Speaker 2>but now straight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

827
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.860
<v Speaker 2>the table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the chips on black and you know,</v>

828
00:36:31.861 --> 00:36:33.930
<v Speaker 2>everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

829
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.530
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I feel it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>troubling about this election is that a</v>

830
00:36:37.531 --> 00:36:40.290
<v Speaker 2>lot of racists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my friend Alonzo boat and had a</v>

831
00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:42.630
<v Speaker 2>great quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said not all trump supporters are</v>

832
00:36:42.631 --> 00:36:45.600
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all racists are trump supporters.</v>

833
00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.730
<v Speaker 2>And that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

834
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.660
<v Speaker 2>like the bill Maher credit by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans.</v>

835
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.300
<v Speaker 2>What do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not all Republicans are racist,</v>

836
00:36:51.301 --> 00:36:52.770
<v Speaker 2>but all racists are Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

837
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:55.560
<v Speaker 2>that's not true though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were a lot of racist Democrats.</v>

838
00:36:55.561 --> 00:36:58.650
<v Speaker 2>That's a bad quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in a terrible quote,</v>

839
00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:02.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe there was racist that voted</v>

840
00:37:02.851 --> 00:37:04.810
<v Speaker 2>for hilary shore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

841
00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:07.680
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's true about,</v>

842
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.340
<v Speaker 2>it's more fun than it is real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

843
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:12.440
<v Speaker 2>as a quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>

844
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.910
<v Speaker 2>it seems like they're out in the public</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

845
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.020
<v Speaker 2>They're out in the open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

846
00:37:16.021 --> 00:37:21.000
<v Speaker 2>I've seen so many videos of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are trump supporters that are using the</v>

847
00:37:21.001 --> 00:37:26.001
<v Speaker 2>fact that trump's in office now to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say a bunch of real really disgusting</v>

848
00:37:26.701 --> 00:37:30.090
<v Speaker 2>racist shit to go crazy and they kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a hall pass,</v>

849
00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:30.970
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

850
00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:32.400
<v Speaker 2>that's a good way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

851
00:37:32.401 --> 00:37:34.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>

852
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:36.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people as you do who voted for</v>

853
00:37:36.961 --> 00:37:38.100
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sadly I do,</v>

854
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.780
<v Speaker 2>but whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

855
00:37:39.781 --> 00:37:43.350
<v Speaker 2>and not all trump supporters are</v>
<v Speaker 2>uneducated,</v>

856
00:37:43.351 --> 00:37:45.450
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of whatever.</v>

859
00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.170
<v Speaker 2>some people did it for the economic</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

860
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:54.120
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that they gave those other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people a hall pass to act like that and</v>

<v Speaker 2>This guy just looked different clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever look at them that way?</v>

882
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.860
<v Speaker 2>And it's a thin layer of gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It separates us from infinity.</v>

883
00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.830
<v Speaker 2>What's your favorite music?</v>

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

886
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Everyone does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might not.</v>

887
00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:00.610
<v Speaker 2>It might be one of those weird John</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ashcroft guys.</v>

888
00:39:00.611 --> 00:39:02.020
<v Speaker 2>It's really into Gospel music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

889
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:04.700
<v Speaker 2>You remember that John Ashcroft Song,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what it led to,</v>

890
00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.050
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

891
00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:12.090
<v Speaker 2>she's never sword before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he was one of the scariest guys</v>

892
00:39:12.221 --> 00:39:17.221
<v Speaker 2>that ever obtained any sort of office or</v>
<v Speaker 2>had any sort of power through Ashcroft.</v>

893
00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:22.180
<v Speaker 2>You remember what state was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're from Missouri maybe.</v>

894
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it was from Missouri.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

895
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.640
<v Speaker 2>He lost the election for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>governorship to a dead man.</v>

896
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Did he?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

897
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.360
<v Speaker 2>That's how much people didn't like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a dead guy.</v>

898
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Bush.</v>

899
00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:38.680
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember when he did he put</v>
<v Speaker 2>coverings over the naked statues,</v>

900
00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:42.040
<v Speaker 2>covered up the boobs and the in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rotunda.</v>

901
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:46.120
<v Speaker 2>So disturbed by their nakedness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We survived that.</v>

902
00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Barely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we went to a war that's still</v>

903
00:39:49.121 --> 00:39:52.120
<v Speaker 2>going on because of that asshole and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other assholes who are in that</v>

904
00:39:52.121 --> 00:39:53.050
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

905
00:39:53.051 --> 00:39:58.051
<v Speaker 2>that administration was a dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark moment of despair and he's a</v>

906
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.760
<v Speaker 2>alleged weapons of mass destruction that</v>
<v Speaker 2>never existed.</v>

907
00:40:03.761 --> 00:40:04.630
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>

908
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.030
<v Speaker 2>And now trump has talking to carl rove</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

909
00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:10.360
<v Speaker 2>but not to Dick Cheney.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about Dick Cheney's fucking</v>

910
00:40:10.361 --> 00:40:12.010
<v Speaker 2>putting on his darth vader mask again.</v>

911
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

912
00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:19.630
<v Speaker 2>We should use this moment to say rest in</v>
<v Speaker 2>peace.</v>

913
00:40:19.631 --> 00:40:24.631
<v Speaker 2>Carrie Fisher as a just fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty.</v>

914
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:26.610
<v Speaker 2>She was only 60.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

915
00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.410
<v Speaker 2>Did she have a drug problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did she have an alcohol problem?</v>

916
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm not current,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she used to was.</v>

917
00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:34.930
<v Speaker 2>It was a pill thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pills and coke and.</v>

918
00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:35.853
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>

919
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:40.540
<v Speaker 2>she was sober in Aa as I understand the</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem is the damage,</v>

920
00:40:40.541 --> 00:40:43.990
<v Speaker 2>those goddamned thing that they due to</v>
<v Speaker 2>your cardiovascular system.</v>

921
00:40:43.991 --> 00:40:46.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just so devastating.</v>

922
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:48.880
<v Speaker 2>She lived hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She lived hard and I think suffered a</v>

923
00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:53.320
<v Speaker 2>lot of physical problems as a result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

924
00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:58.300
<v Speaker 2>that was even sadder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've got to think that he probably</v>

925
00:40:58.301 --> 00:41:03.301
<v Speaker 2>went out and the wave of Dick's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a tsunami of them probably just</v>

926
00:41:03.461 --> 00:41:06.420
<v Speaker 2>exhausted from origins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

927
00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:11.650
<v Speaker 2>somehow I just feel like he squeezed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of life in 53 years I think.</v>

928
00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.650
<v Speaker 2>I think you did too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Pun intended or unintended back George.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

930
00:41:19.361 --> 00:41:20.490
<v Speaker 2>But with guys like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

931
00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:22.600
<v Speaker 2>I often wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

932
00:41:22.601 --> 00:41:26.230
<v Speaker 2>with being a songwriter or I hit maker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

933
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:29.770
<v Speaker 2>is it better to have had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

934
00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:34.830
<v Speaker 2>one hit or a few hits and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely fade away?</v>

935
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Not that he faded away into obscurity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe he's not a good example or to not</v>

936
00:41:39.261 --> 00:41:43.460
<v Speaker 2>have it at all because I think George</v>
<v Speaker 2>did kind of carry with him that like he</v>

937
00:41:43.461 --> 00:41:46.190
<v Speaker 2>was no longer current sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

938
00:41:46.191 --> 00:41:48.860
<v Speaker 2>that's a weird thing where someone's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous anymore.</v>

939
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:51.950
<v Speaker 2>They're kind of a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas a regular person,</v>

940
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.210
<v Speaker 2>not a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

941
00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.880
<v Speaker 2>here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember when Gary Coleman was a</v>

942
00:41:55.881 --> 00:41:57.750
<v Speaker 2>security guard?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a,</v>

943
00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:01.850
<v Speaker 2>he had to get a job and it was a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem because Gary Coleman was just</v>

944
00:42:01.851 --> 00:42:04.280
<v Speaker 2>trying to do his job and just trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get paid so he can eat,</v>

945
00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just trying to feed himself like</v>

946
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:06.980
<v Speaker 2>all the rest of us.</v>

947
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.580
<v Speaker 2>And people would come up to him and take</v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures of them and mock him and they</v>

948
00:42:10.581 --> 00:42:14.120
<v Speaker 2>would use him as a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you don't use a regular security</v>

949
00:42:14.121 --> 00:42:16.310
<v Speaker 2>guard as a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you see a regular security</v>

950
00:42:16.311 --> 00:42:16.671
<v Speaker 2>guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

951
00:42:16.671 --> 00:42:17.570
<v Speaker 2>what's up man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How you doing?</v>

952
00:42:17.571 --> 00:42:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go this building right</v>

953
00:42:19.041 --> 00:42:20.060
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who See your id?</v>

954
00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:21.080
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything's fine.</v>

955
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:22.140
<v Speaker 2>You don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

956
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:24.830
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking security guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at Joe.</v>

957
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:29.090
<v Speaker 2>Because he used to be something greater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

958
00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

959
00:42:30.501 --> 00:42:33.290
<v Speaker 2>There's a poor Gary Coleman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a security guard.</v>

960
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:35.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so troubling.</v>

961
00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:40.310
<v Speaker 2>And it kind of really plays into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole idea of fame and perversion and</v>

962
00:42:40.431 --> 00:42:42.320
<v Speaker 2>America and the things that we hold</v>
<v Speaker 2>dear.</v>

963
00:42:42.321 --> 00:42:45.020
<v Speaker 2>The things that are valuable to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of the American,</v>

964
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:49.280
<v Speaker 2>that disillusion of American values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think that's the rise of trump.</v>

965
00:42:49.281 --> 00:42:50.600
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a values thing.</v>

966
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:54.800
<v Speaker 2>I had a guy gave me a hard time once</v>
<v Speaker 2>about not about fear factor being</v>

967
00:42:54.801 --> 00:42:59.801
<v Speaker 2>canceled and he was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking a here at cvs.</v>

968
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:02.330
<v Speaker 2>He was working at cvs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

969
00:43:02.331 --> 00:43:06.050
<v Speaker 2>what happened to his show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said it was canceled no more.</v>

970
00:43:06.051 --> 00:43:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Show her like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all attitude.</v>

971
00:43:08.201 --> 00:43:09.034
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

972
00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:10.470
<v Speaker 2>shows go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

973
00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:14.140
<v Speaker 2>They go on and then they get canceled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had was,</v>

974
00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:16.310
<v Speaker 2>we had a good run me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was like,</v>

975
00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.070
<v Speaker 2>he was being aggressive about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so weird.</v>

976
00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:20.270
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

977
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Just bizarre detachment from reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're working at fucking cvs dude.</v>

978
00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not giving you a hard time</v>
<v Speaker 2>about being a cvs guy.</v>

979
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if,</v>

980
00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.430
<v Speaker 2>if I was the guy from fear factor and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I was a cvs guy,</v>

981
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:34.990
<v Speaker 2>how bad would you shit on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm just coming in as a guy buying</v>

982
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:35.930
<v Speaker 2>some cough drops.</v>

983
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.630
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what a weird thing that we have</v>

984
00:43:38.631 --> 00:43:40.250
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this need to.</v>

985
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:44.210
<v Speaker 2>When someone attains a very high status</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then falls off of that,</v>

986
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:47.630
<v Speaker 2>what we think we think they're down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to attack.</v>

987
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:49.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an animal thing.</v>

988
00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.530
<v Speaker 2>But in your case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>best thing that ever happened to you?</v>

989
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't think he knew.</v>

990
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he probably didn't know that it had a</v>

991
00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:57.950
<v Speaker 2>standup career that I was doing the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 2>or anything.</v>

992
00:43:57.951 --> 00:43:58.551
<v Speaker 2>He was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

993
00:43:58.551 --> 00:43:59.450
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

994
00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.630
<v Speaker 2>what is your show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like crazy accent.</v>

995
00:44:02.631 --> 00:44:03.550
<v Speaker 2>All aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

996
00:44:03.551 --> 00:44:05.140
<v Speaker 2>all right dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that is.</v>

997
00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.430
<v Speaker 2>It was like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was so blatant.</v>

998
00:44:07.431 --> 00:44:09.860
<v Speaker 2>It was confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like I being pumped.</v>

999
00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:10.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1000
00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.830
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the idea of like a,</v>

1001
00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:13.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1002
00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.710
<v Speaker 2>winning that idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to win,</v>

1003
00:44:15.711 --> 00:44:19.340
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That trumps trump thing.</v>

1004
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:23.990
<v Speaker 2>That's the trump thing that's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>disturbing is that that winning thing</v>

1005
00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.130
<v Speaker 2>got a win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to win.</v>

1006
00:44:25.131 --> 00:44:26.930
<v Speaker 2>And not this lack of person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1007
00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:30.590
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking 70 man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That ain't a lot of time left bro.</v>

1008
00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:32.580
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're super lucky,</v>

1009
00:44:32.581 --> 00:44:35.640
<v Speaker 2>you got 20 summers left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're super lucky,</v>

1010
00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:38.410
<v Speaker 2>if everything goes great and he's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>that healthy,</v>

1011
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:43.470
<v Speaker 2>he's fat is fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His Chin just has like a very slow</v>

1012
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:48.500
<v Speaker 2>sloping lab of skin that's loosely</v>
<v Speaker 2>attached to his neck.</v>

1013
00:44:48.991 --> 00:44:52.920
<v Speaker 2>That goes down to his collarbone and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't look like a healthy 70 year old.</v>

1014
00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.890
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think so either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sylvester stallone is older than him.</v>

1015
00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.900
<v Speaker 2>That's a good piece of A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1016
00:44:57.901 --> 00:44:59.130
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put it in perspective.</v>

1017
00:44:59.131 --> 00:45:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Sean connery total of both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1018
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.740
<v Speaker 2>they're both older than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That whole idea.</v>

1019
00:45:03.741 --> 00:45:07.710
<v Speaker 2>It's just that destruction of sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the things that we have instilled</v>

1020
00:45:07.711 --> 00:45:08.730
<v Speaker 2>as being an important.</v>

1021
00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:10.320
<v Speaker 2>Like you could have a winning</v>
<v Speaker 2>temperament.</v>

1022
00:45:10.321 --> 00:45:14.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make America win again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that the most important sort of</v>

1023
00:45:14.821 --> 00:45:19.140
<v Speaker 2>attribute for someone to attain to what</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that even mean when and it's so</v>

1024
00:45:19.141 --> 00:45:21.360
<v Speaker 2>attached to like a financial thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1025
00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:25.650
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of value system is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there are other ways to quote</v>

1026
00:45:25.651 --> 00:45:26.550
<v Speaker 2>unquote win at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into time.</v>

1027
00:45:26.551 --> 00:45:28.740
<v Speaker 2>It'd be tied to money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is it becomes</v>

1028
00:45:28.741 --> 00:45:30.000
<v Speaker 2>attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1029
00:45:30.001 --> 00:45:33.840
<v Speaker 2>when you see someone who has a slick</v>
<v Speaker 2>back hair and a private jet and he takes</v>

1030
00:45:33.841 --> 00:45:38.700
<v Speaker 2>a photo with his expensive shoes on his</v>
<v Speaker 2>private jet and it's on his instagram</v>

1031
00:45:38.701 --> 00:45:39.690
<v Speaker 2>and then he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1032
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:43.560
<v Speaker 2>that all stuff becomes very attractive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then people aspire to that and then,</v>

1033
00:45:43.561 --> 00:45:45.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get that Gordon Gekko greed is good</v>

1034
00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:47.970
<v Speaker 2>thing you write,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greed is good,</v>

1035
00:45:47.971 --> 00:45:50.520
<v Speaker 2>but also like that level of aspiration.</v>

1036
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.860
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty much not attainable.</v>

1037
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean mullins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Attainable.</v>

1038
00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put One or what to private jet rich.</v>

1039
00:45:57.211 --> 00:45:58.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people can do it.</v>

1040
00:45:58.531 --> 00:46:01.110
<v Speaker 2>They obviously have one percent of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one percent of percent.</v>

1041
00:46:01.111 --> 00:46:02.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean that level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1042
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:07.340
<v Speaker 2>like the people were following the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people on instagram and instagram</v>

1043
00:46:07.341 --> 00:46:09.390
<v Speaker 2>who have instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1044
00:46:09.391 --> 00:46:14.391
<v Speaker 2>Grandpa fucking the on that series of</v>
<v Speaker 2>tubes.</v>

1054
00:46:42.061 --> 00:46:44.010
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment was like this idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

00:46:44.011 --> 00:46:46.320
<v Speaker 2>well he's got $50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion dollars.</v>

1056
00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:49.590
<v Speaker 2>Why doesn't he just retired?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never fucking retire to read Steve</v>

1057
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last words.</v>

1058
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever read that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1059
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:52.740
<v Speaker 2>Let me say you might want to bring them</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

1060
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:53.491
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>

1061
00:46:53.491 --> 00:46:55.200
<v Speaker 2>really fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like he's,</v>

1062
00:46:55.250 --> 00:46:57.580
<v Speaker 2>it's his last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever mean,</v>

1063
00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:00.000
<v Speaker 2>maybe not the last word he said to his</v>
<v Speaker 2>wife or something,</v>

1064
00:47:00.001 --> 00:47:02.100
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of his last cohesive</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought was like,</v>

1065
00:47:02.101 --> 00:47:02.934
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1066
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:04.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people,</v>

1067
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:06.400
<v Speaker 2>the world views me as completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful and,</v>

1068
00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:10.380
<v Speaker 2>and I've achieved so much in business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1069
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:13.260
<v Speaker 2>my personal life and everything that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was lacking,</v>

1070
00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was just Kinda sorta coming clean</v>

1071
00:47:16.081 --> 00:47:19.140
<v Speaker 2>about the imbalance and it all kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming clean about the,</v>

1072
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:21.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the levels of discontent in the path of</v>

1073
00:47:21.721 --> 00:47:23.610
<v Speaker 2>the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the soul,</v>

1074
00:47:23.611 --> 00:47:26.700
<v Speaker 2>the path of the spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he was essentially a spiritual</v>

1075
00:47:26.701 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 2>guy and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a meditator is practitioner of Zen</v>

1076
00:47:30.041 --> 00:47:33.460
<v Speaker 2>and into Neem Karoli Baba and all sorts</v>
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>

1077
00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:38.460
<v Speaker 2>But he got so wrapped up in those</v>
<v Speaker 2>vicious sort of cycle of having to</v>

1078
00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.500
<v Speaker 2>produce product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>product,</v>

1079
00:47:41.501 --> 00:47:44.020
<v Speaker 2>product and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apple essentially in,</v>

1080
00:47:44.021 --> 00:47:45.430
<v Speaker 2>in his words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1081
00:47:45.431 --> 00:47:50.431
<v Speaker 2>he made it into a product company and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how we defined it.</v>

1082
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:54.130
<v Speaker 2>And not even an idea company was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>product company.</v>

1083
00:47:54.131 --> 00:47:58.210
<v Speaker 2>And then products are based on having to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the latest version of the product</v>

1084
00:47:58.211 --> 00:48:00.790
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he just got wrapped up in kind of</v>

1085
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.300
<v Speaker 2>lost his soul isn't an interesting in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that like bill,</v>

1086
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>two competitors that we always thought</v>

1087
00:48:06.971 --> 00:48:08.830
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Gates was thought to be the</v>

1088
00:48:08.831 --> 00:48:13.600
<v Speaker 2>business guy who's the cold hard and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a lot of ways.</v>

1089
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Sure back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at him in his older</v>

1090
00:48:17.111 --> 00:48:19.300
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he became very charitable,</v>

1091
00:48:19.301 --> 00:48:24.301
<v Speaker 2>involved in a bunch of humanitarian</v>
<v Speaker 2>efforts and does a lot of amazing work</v>

1092
00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:29.401
<v Speaker 2>and is using his substantial wealth for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of good and doesn't work anymore.</v>

1093
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.170
<v Speaker 2>It's just he's done with all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's all just doing humanitarian work</v>

1094
00:48:32.171 --> 00:48:34.420
<v Speaker 2>and helping people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of beautiful.</v>

1095
00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:36.410
<v Speaker 2>And he became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1096
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:39.460
<v Speaker 2>this different guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As he got older he became wiser and</v>

1097
00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:44.461
<v Speaker 2>became much more involved in doing good</v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to help and trying to use</v>

1098
00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:49.270
<v Speaker 2>that immense amount of money that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>acquired by being a ruthless sort of</v>

1099
00:48:49.271 --> 00:48:51.730
<v Speaker 2>business gangster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but doing it for good.</v>

1100
00:48:51.731 --> 00:48:54.910
<v Speaker 2>Which is kind of really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he decided,</v>

1101
00:48:54.911 --> 00:48:56.050
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to step back here.</v>

1102
00:48:56.051 --> 00:48:59.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set back and think about what I'm doing</v>

1103
00:48:59.141 --> 00:49:01.120
<v Speaker 2>and what's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1104
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:03.660
<v Speaker 2>this last stage of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a,</v>

1105
00:49:03.661 --> 00:49:04.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Karma Yoga.</v>

1106
00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Karma Yoga is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1107
00:49:06.581 --> 00:49:08.320
<v Speaker 2>about the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1108
00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to the path of the Saudi in,</v>

1109
00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.370
<v Speaker 2>in India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like traditionally the path of the saw,</v>

1110
00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.880
<v Speaker 2>do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of historically.</v>

1111
00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.260
<v Speaker 2>And traditionally it's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1112
00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:22.280
<v Speaker 2>the who grows up as born in India and is</v>
<v Speaker 2>raised into education event,</v>

1113
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:24.950
<v Speaker 2>become a householder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>householder,</v>

1114
00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:29.710
<v Speaker 2>meaning getting married and has kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm works as career provides for the</v>

1115
00:49:29.711 --> 00:49:32.650
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in the last third of his life</v>

1116
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:35.830
<v Speaker 2>becomes a Saudi drops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of it walks away.</v>

1117
00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Kids are grown up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the house,</v>

1118
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:41.500
<v Speaker 2>kind of leaves of his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of a bummer for her,</v>

1119
00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:43.300
<v Speaker 2>but for her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in kind of a concept,</v>

1120
00:49:43.301 --> 00:49:46.510
<v Speaker 2>maybe she was annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she wanted to keep wanting to</v>

1121
00:49:46.511 --> 00:49:48.070
<v Speaker 2>leave anywhere verses and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1122
00:49:48.071 --> 00:49:49.120
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to meditate.</v>

1123
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:50.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm shopping online,</v>

1124
00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:56.170
<v Speaker 2>but they need to take off and it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wandering then to India and that's the</v>

1125
00:49:56.171 --> 00:49:56.921
<v Speaker 2>path of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do.</v>

1126
00:49:56.921 --> 00:49:58.750
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of broken into different</v>
<v Speaker 2>phases.</v>

1127
00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:00.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's the right way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it either.</v>

1128
00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.593
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1129
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:03.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting.</v>

1130
00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:04.950
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting way of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

1131
00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:06.160
<v Speaker 2>of looking at it that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1132
00:50:06.161 --> 00:50:09.100
<v Speaker 2>you have achieved a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've accumulated a lot and now I can</v>

1133
00:50:09.101 --> 00:50:10.620
<v Speaker 2>go be of service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1134
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:13.040
<v Speaker 2>service is always a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1135
00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:15.340
<v Speaker 2>wasn't the Saudis are really into Hash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1136
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that the big thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll make chillums you can smell it.</v>

1137
00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Depends what a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a lineage you belong to.</v>

1138
00:50:21.911 --> 00:50:26.911
<v Speaker 2>I've sat with some of them in the Naga</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baba is and the Colombo Mineola and part</v>

1139
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:31.190
<v Speaker 2>of sat with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is amazing how when people discussed</v>

1140
00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:35.870
<v Speaker 2>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they discuss hinduism or the Sikhs or</v>

1141
00:50:35.871 --> 00:50:38.570
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of the various strains of,</v>

1142
00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:43.670
<v Speaker 2>of religions that are inexorably</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to psychedelics,</v>

1143
00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:47.600
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics are rarely discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1144
00:50:47.601 --> 00:50:52.601
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you go and you read like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>vimanas or read any of the ancient Hindu</v>

1145
00:50:54.531 --> 00:50:57.680
<v Speaker 2>text,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many references to soma and</v>

1146
00:50:57.681 --> 00:51:02.240
<v Speaker 2>so many references to what is obviously</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a psychoactive substance,</v>

1147
00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:03.590
<v Speaker 2>you know this.</v>

1148
00:51:03.590 --> 00:51:08.590
<v Speaker 2>But when people talk about like Hinduism</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hardly ever comes up,</v>

1149
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:13.820
<v Speaker 2>can you talk about Yogis and dues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hardly ever comes up in the modern</v>

1150
00:51:13.821 --> 00:51:16.670
<v Speaker 2>sort of take on it because there have</v>
<v Speaker 2>been a,</v>

1151
00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:21.700
<v Speaker 2>there's kind of a revival of within</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hinduism have kind of an Orthodox</v>

1152
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:23.750
<v Speaker 2>version of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1153
00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:26.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and free and that's sort of,</v>

1154
00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.970
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of a modern revival within</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Hindu tradition,</v>

1155
00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:31.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they've kind of pushed that aside.</v>

1156
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.420
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1157
00:51:32.421 --> 00:51:34.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bong is the,</v>

1158
00:51:34.221 --> 00:51:37.760
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a powdery pot thing that you</v>

1159
00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:38.910
<v Speaker 2>just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1160
00:51:38.911 --> 00:51:40.280
<v Speaker 2>you swallow some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1161
00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:42.620
<v Speaker 2>How does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that stuff made with its,</v>

1162
00:51:42.621 --> 00:51:46.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you take like the leaves and you grind</v>

1163
00:51:46.251 --> 00:51:49.760
<v Speaker 2>up the leaves into a fine powder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's some kind of cooking</v>

1164
00:51:49.761 --> 00:51:52.760
<v Speaker 2>process and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but within just the leaves,</v>

1165
00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:55.640
<v Speaker 2>the shake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the scraps is enough and you can</v>

1166
00:51:55.641 --> 00:51:59.690
<v Speaker 2>extract the thc in some kind of cooking</v>
<v Speaker 2>process and you make it into a fine</v>

1167
00:51:59.691 --> 00:52:02.780
<v Speaker 2>powder and just throw it down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw it down,</v>

1168
00:52:02.781 --> 00:52:03.350
<v Speaker 2>and it hadn't.</v>

1169
00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:05.360
<v Speaker 2>It gets you pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty toasty.</v>

1170
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1171
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:10.430
<v Speaker 2>Well I know that there are also into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>crystals and they take the crystals and</v>

1172
00:52:10.431 --> 00:52:13.910
<v Speaker 2>mash them up and sort of make like kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a hash out of,</v>

1173
00:52:13.911 --> 00:52:14.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1174
00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:19.580
<v Speaker 2>the scrape from the thc crystals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that called?</v>

1175
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.850
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1176
00:52:21.940 --> 00:52:26.420
<v Speaker 2>We both know some sort of a mushy sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of waxy type jazz.</v>

1177
00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:28.010
<v Speaker 2>They'd take that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1178
00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:29.060
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1179
00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:32.240
<v Speaker 2>back to the original thread of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

1180
00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:35.700
<v Speaker 2>it's like every tradition has some kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Sacrum,</v>

1181
00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:38.040
<v Speaker 2>a mind altering sacrament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vedic texts,</v>

1182
00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.060
<v Speaker 2>all these different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1183
00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:41.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean they look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they had to be,</v>

1184
00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:43.910
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they obviously were aware of these</v>

1185
00:52:43.911 --> 00:52:46.370
<v Speaker 2>substances and they found these</v>
<v Speaker 2>substances.</v>

1186
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:51.440
<v Speaker 2>There was no science back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no real understanding of</v>

1187
00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:54.170
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No real understanding of your body,</v>

1188
00:52:54.171 --> 00:52:57.710
<v Speaker 2>but there was these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this access to this stuff.</v>

1189
00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see those things that are grown on</v>

1190
00:52:59.691 --> 00:53:03.200
<v Speaker 2>that couch it if you take that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will meet God.</v>

1191
00:53:03.310 --> 00:53:05.690
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people did it and did meet God</v>

1192
00:53:05.691 --> 00:53:06.560
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

1193
00:53:06.561 --> 00:53:09.770
<v Speaker 2>You're telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there is like everybody wants.</v>

1194
00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Like if you think about religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about the stories that</v>

1195
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:17.410
<v Speaker 2>people tell of the wise men and were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1196
00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:20.390
<v Speaker 2>the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the burning Bush and God gives them the</v>

1197
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.900
<v Speaker 2>10 commandments and all these different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that happen.</v>

1198
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.550
<v Speaker 2>There are all sorts of beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>

1199
00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:30.960
<v Speaker 2>but your everyday life experiences so</v>
<v Speaker 2>flat and fucking boring.</v>

1200
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:34.380
<v Speaker 2>And then you do take these things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

1201
00:53:34.381 --> 00:53:35.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just gonna be just like</v>

1202
00:53:35.821 --> 00:53:38.190
<v Speaker 2>everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just flat and boring and bullshit.</v>

1203
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:40.980
<v Speaker 2>And he take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take those mushrooms that you pluck off</v>

1204
00:53:40.981 --> 00:53:42.270
<v Speaker 2>that cow shit and all of a sudden,</v>

1205
00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:46.120
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's</v>

1206
00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:51.120
<v Speaker 2>exposed to you in some grand way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then your whole life becomes about</v>

1207
00:53:51.851 --> 00:53:53.140
<v Speaker 2>worshiping that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1208
00:53:53.141 --> 00:53:56.320
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mckenna always argued that,</v>

1209
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:57.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1210
00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.770
<v Speaker 2>all the ancient cattle worshiping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1211
00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:04.490
<v Speaker 2>religions and cattle worshiping</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations like to talk to all he</v>

1212
00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:08.800
<v Speaker 2>took and all these really old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old cultures that that's what was all</v>

1213
00:54:08.801 --> 00:54:10.930
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that these people had found out that</v>

1214
00:54:10.931 --> 00:54:14.870
<v Speaker 2>cows grow mushrooms on their shit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>

1215
00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.380
<v Speaker 2>they weren't able to differentiate</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the,</v>

1216
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:19.300
<v Speaker 2>they thought it was coming out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cow's body,</v>

1217
00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:22.090
<v Speaker 2>the cow would shit it out and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't understand sports.</v>

1218
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:24.820
<v Speaker 2>So they thought it was inside the cow</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it would grow in the shed.</v>

1219
00:54:24.821 --> 00:54:27.150
<v Speaker 2>And that was your portal to God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1220
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be rarely hear that discussed.</v>

1221
00:54:29.261 --> 00:54:31.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean you always hear it discussed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of like an agricultural and</v>

1222
00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:34.320
<v Speaker 2>resource that that's why they worship</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cows,</v>

1223
00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:36.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that not just makes me think it goes</v>

1224
00:54:36.581 --> 00:54:37.710
<v Speaker 2>back to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1225
00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:41.890
<v Speaker 2>and I'm someone who I'm a very spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 2>person and have a practice and all that</v>

1226
00:54:41.891 --> 00:54:42.400
<v Speaker 2>kind of stuff.</v>

1227
00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.530
<v Speaker 2>But like that just brings up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>question to me,</v>

1228
00:54:44.531 --> 00:54:48.910
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did we invent God as a result of those</v>

1229
00:54:48.911 --> 00:54:51.780
<v Speaker 2>experiences?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like a good.</v>

1230
00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:53.320
<v Speaker 2>Chris Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he was here,</v>

1231
00:54:53.321 --> 00:54:55.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like the hunter gatherer kind of</v>

1232
00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.900
<v Speaker 2>tribal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1233
00:54:56.901 --> 00:55:01.360
<v Speaker 2>when we were just starting starting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn to depict our experiences and talk</v>

1234
00:55:01.361 --> 00:55:05.140
<v Speaker 2>about our experiences and creating like</v>
<v Speaker 2>an oral history and sort of like the</v>

1235
00:55:05.141 --> 00:55:10.141
<v Speaker 2>first kind of existential dilemmas and</v>
<v Speaker 2>which many say came from psychedelic</v>

1236
00:55:10.931 --> 00:55:15.550
<v Speaker 2>awareness back in those days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is that what led to the creation of</v>

1237
00:55:15.551 --> 00:55:18.370
<v Speaker 2>God and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to me it doesn't make a difference.</v>

1238
00:55:18.371 --> 00:55:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Being a believer of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really care if it's real or myth</v>

1239
00:55:21.791 --> 00:55:23.260
<v Speaker 2>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works for me,</v>

1240
00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:26.260
<v Speaker 2>but it does make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It almost doesn't matter.</v>

1241
00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:29.380
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter if it benefits you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in it,</v>

1242
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.310
<v Speaker 2>it benefits you.</v>

1243
00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.170
<v Speaker 2>People ask me that all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1244
00:55:32.380 --> 00:55:34.570
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually believe in flying monkeys</v>

1245
00:55:34.571 --> 00:55:39.550
<v Speaker 2>and a blue guy playing a flute and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fields I've seen flying monkeys.</v>

1246
00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:42.940
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those people talking shit.</v>

1247
00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:47.710
<v Speaker 2>I've seen jokers giving me the finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're spinning and geometric patterns</v>

1248
00:55:47.711 --> 00:55:50.320
<v Speaker 2>that were infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a lot of shit that's way more</v>

1249
00:55:50.321 --> 00:55:54.600
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous than a guy with a harp and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only have you seen it and have I</v>

1250
00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:56.830
<v Speaker 2>seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can tell everybody listening how</v>

1251
00:55:56.831 --> 00:55:57.664
<v Speaker 2>to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1252
00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:59.140
<v Speaker 2>they can see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see it.</v>

1253
00:55:59.141 --> 00:56:00.970
<v Speaker 2>If you have the courage and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>substances,</v>

1254
00:56:00.971 --> 00:56:01.801
<v Speaker 2>you can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1255
00:56:01.801 --> 00:56:05.470
<v Speaker 2>you can and it works on everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Except I think it's the DMT apparently</v>

1256
00:56:05.471 --> 00:56:09.030
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work on everybody because like</v>
<v Speaker 2>one out of a thousand or it like</v>

1257
00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.020

<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

1258

<v Speaker 2>concert and drove home two hours later.</v>

1262

<v Speaker 2>The edibles today in my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's afraid to Goddamn Halligan working</v>

1263
00:56:32.261 --> 00:56:34.840
<v Speaker 2>the controls over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean for the first time in my life I</v>

1264
00:56:34.841 --> 00:56:37.420
<v Speaker 2>feel like kind of finally like an old</v>
<v Speaker 2>hippie.</v>

1265
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1266
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:41.710
<v Speaker 2>the edibles when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like that today,</v>

1267
00:56:41.711 --> 00:56:43.600
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit's insane.</v>

1268
00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:46.840
<v Speaker 2>These fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a jumbo spray.</v>

1269
00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:50.770
<v Speaker 2>I took 10 hits of this before maybe 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget,</v>

1270
00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:54.340
<v Speaker 2>for a Sam Harris' podcast I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1271
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:59.370
<v Speaker 2>I was skiing downhill straight with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't crashing,</v>

1272
00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:04.150
<v Speaker 2>but I was figuring out how to barely</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay up the entire conversation.</v>

1273
00:57:04.151 --> 00:57:05.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what in the fuck have I done?</v>

1274
00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I was so high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was probably as high as I've ever</v>

1275
00:57:09.251 --> 00:57:11.060
<v Speaker 2>been in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was at the last seminar,</v>

1276
00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:14.950
<v Speaker 2>spoke to Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam's a perfect guy to be that baked</v>

1277
00:57:14.951 --> 00:57:18.550
<v Speaker 2>with because all you have to do is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>wind them up and say something and he's</v>

1278
00:57:18.551 --> 00:57:22.210
<v Speaker 2>so eloquent that he could just continue</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go on these amazing as long as you</v>

1279
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:23.650
<v Speaker 2>keep up with what he's saying.</v>

1280
00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:25.990
<v Speaker 2>So you have like good questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is,</v>

1281
00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:29.320
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's all due respect to stem and I</v>

1282
00:57:29.321 --> 00:57:31.570
<v Speaker 2>do think you're smarter than me in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Iq,</v>

1283
00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:36.340
<v Speaker 2>but I do think he uses head intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of Kinda shuck and jive you a</v>

1284
00:57:36.341 --> 00:57:37.660
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shuck and jive household.</v>

1285
00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like.</v>

1286
00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so smart and so articulate and</v>

1287
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:45.820
<v Speaker 2>bright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously brilliant and mad respect for</v>

1288
00:57:45.821 --> 00:57:48.130
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't think he's right about</v>

1289
00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:48.881
<v Speaker 2>what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1290
00:57:48.881 --> 00:57:51.520
<v Speaker 2>let's take Islam for example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many things,</v>

1291
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:52.770
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1292
00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:56.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam and it's sort of like the right to</v>

1293
00:57:56.921 --> 00:58:00.850
<v Speaker 2>sort of like prepare for violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1294
00:58:00.851 --> 00:58:03.460
<v Speaker 2>and kind of self defense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really agree with that</v>

1295
00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.710
<v Speaker 2>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1296
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:08.200
<v Speaker 2>and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree with it because I think if</v>

1297
00:58:08.201 --> 00:58:11.140
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just invites the consciousness into</v>

1298
00:58:11.141 --> 00:58:13.930
<v Speaker 2>your head to where you are going to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to use it.</v>

1299
00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:19.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested in the idea that self</v>
<v Speaker 2>defense and preparing for something sets</v>

1300
00:58:20.591 --> 00:58:25.591
<v Speaker 2>up the stage to make something happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>different than say getting in there in</v>

1301
00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:28.180
<v Speaker 2>the octagon and the MMA stuff and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1302
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:30.310
<v Speaker 2>well that's a competition the</v>
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>

1303
00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:34.540
<v Speaker 2>But you think like maybe like guy walks</v>
<v Speaker 2>around with a gun and a knife and I</v>

1304
00:58:34.541 --> 00:58:37.300
<v Speaker 2>think it will improve vest and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>invites the consciousness into,</v>

1305
00:58:37.301 --> 00:58:40.630
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the atmosphere and it creates the</v>

1306
00:58:40.631 --> 00:58:43.990
<v Speaker 2>energetic cycle of having to use that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Sam kind of throws up those</v>

1307
00:58:43.991 --> 00:58:47.290
<v Speaker 2>statistics that well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about the same odds as having a car</v>

1308
00:58:47.291 --> 00:58:52.291
<v Speaker 2>crash or as you are going to experience</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of act of violence in your</v>

1309
00:58:52.571 --> 00:58:55.360
<v Speaker 2>life where you will need to learn how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1310
00:58:56.330 --> 00:58:58.690
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something self defend yourself and I</v>

1311
00:58:58.750 --> 00:58:59.890
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1312
00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you can throw at that math to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it depends on certain</v>

1313
00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:07.120
<v Speaker 2>socioeconomic conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't think that's true.</v>

1314
00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:12.120
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want that consciousness in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life and I don't think we should need</v>

1315
00:59:12.431 --> 00:59:16.990
<v Speaker 2>to dissolve that consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I certainly think you're free to not</v>

1316
00:59:16.991 --> 00:59:21.140
<v Speaker 2>have those thoughts in your head and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose to take the path of love and</v>

1317
00:59:21.141 --> 00:59:24.320
<v Speaker 2>acceptance and just passively and move</v>
<v Speaker 2>through this life.</v>

1318
00:59:24.321 --> 00:59:29.321
<v Speaker 2>But the reality of human beings is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been unfortunately watching some</v>

1319
00:59:30.381 --> 00:59:32.240
<v Speaker 2>videos online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched this video today,</v>

1320
00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:35.450
<v Speaker 2>have a guy kicking some lady down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stairs for no reason.</v>

1321
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:37.700
<v Speaker 2>He was behind her and then they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking out for.</v>

1322
00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.950
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to find him in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got photos of him,</v>

1323
00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:42.540
<v Speaker 2>but he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was walking in front of them.</v>

1324
00:59:42.850 --> 00:59:45.170
<v Speaker 2>Don't go on the stairs and he walked up</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind her and just,</v>

1325
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:49.430
<v Speaker 2>just a random person kicked her down</v>
<v Speaker 2>this flight of stairs and she's horribly</v>

1326
00:59:49.431 --> 00:59:51.040
<v Speaker 2>injured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1327
00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:54.500
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a bunch of those things do</v>

1328
00:59:54.501 --> 00:59:54.950
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

1329
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:57.440
<v Speaker 2>You can run into the wrong people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes they do.</v>

1330
00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.860
<v Speaker 2>They do have you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1331
00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:00.270
<v Speaker 2>steven pinker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>minerals,</v>

1332
01:00:00.271 --> 01:00:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Angel Story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1333
01:00:02.241 --> 01:00:03.074
<v Speaker 2>we are in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1334
01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.780
<v Speaker 2>those things happen and look around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world today and flip on the news and</v>

1335
01:00:05.781 --> 01:00:09.680
<v Speaker 2>it's highly disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we are living in the most peaceful</v>

1336
01:00:09.681 --> 01:00:11.330
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing time of our,</v>

1337
01:00:11.331 --> 01:00:12.500
<v Speaker 2>of our existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1338
01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:16.010
<v Speaker 2>if you were a 30 year old man in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>year 1500,</v>

1339
01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:19.120
<v Speaker 2>you're most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the highest cause of death was not</v>

1340
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:21.410
<v Speaker 2>disease or infection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was an act of violence.</v>

1341
01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:24.980
<v Speaker 2>You were going to be raping and</v>
<v Speaker 2>pillaging and you just had to defend</v>

1342
01:00:24.981 --> 01:00:29.060
<v Speaker 2>your food supply for Granuloma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we have come to some kind of</v>

1343
01:00:29.061 --> 01:00:32.300
<v Speaker 2>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of collective consciousness</v>

1344
01:00:32.301 --> 01:00:36.530
<v Speaker 2>that has morphed itself together in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>form of cooperation.</v>

1345
01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:40.340
<v Speaker 2>We have to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's so many of us know and it's</v>

1346
01:00:40.341 --> 01:00:41.000
<v Speaker 2>getting more of us.</v>

1347
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.280
<v Speaker 2>The planet is getting smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to cooperate,</v>

1348
01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:45.620
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you do with those guys that</v>

1349
01:00:45.621 --> 01:00:47.390
<v Speaker 2>kick women down flights of stairs like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1350
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1351
01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:54.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess there's some sort of forum of</v>

1352
01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:56.240
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1353
01:00:56.270 --> 01:01:00.230
<v Speaker 2>I guess punishment and we do have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we live in a society where law and order</v>

1354
01:01:00.231 --> 01:01:02.900
<v Speaker 2>is maybe a necessary evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1355
01:01:02.901 --> 01:01:03.591
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1356
01:01:03.591 --> 01:01:07.070
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure there's some kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>incarceration,</v>

1357
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:08.890
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1358
01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:11.390
<v Speaker 2>you got to love them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got to have compassion for them</v>

1359
01:01:11.391 --> 01:01:15.560
<v Speaker 2>and you've got to just teach them with</v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion that their action was wrong.</v>

1360
01:01:15.561 --> 01:01:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Don't kick the lady down the stairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1361
01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:20.510
<v Speaker 2>here's why you shouldn't do that and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>love you and it's going to be okay.</v>

1362
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:23.060
<v Speaker 2>People right now are up in arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to kick your ass.</v>

1363
01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:23.560
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

1364
01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:27.830
<v Speaker 2>It was a right now in Nebraska,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this fucking happy fucking Tim</v>

1365
01:01:27.831 --> 01:01:32.831
<v Speaker 2>leary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pussy kick is a kick his ass.</v>

1366
01:01:33.201 --> 01:01:35.150
<v Speaker 2>He pass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1367
01:01:35.151 --> 01:01:37.940
<v Speaker 2>and I'm a on a different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1368
01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.300
<v Speaker 2>it's a beautiful thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1369
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:42.470
<v Speaker 2>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be there.</v>

1370
01:01:42.471 --> 01:01:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Is there some people that you can run</v>
<v Speaker 2>into though?</v>

1371
01:01:44.391 --> 01:01:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately you're better off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that expression about having a</v>

1372
01:01:48.261 --> 01:01:50.450
<v Speaker 2>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're better off having it,</v>

1373
01:01:50.451 --> 01:01:52.670
<v Speaker 2>not needing it then needing it and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>having it.</v>

1374
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:54.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1375
01:01:54.081 --> 01:01:55.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I get it.</v>

1376
01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.370
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I understand the arguments about</v>

1377
01:01:58.371 --> 01:02:01.040
<v Speaker 2>that guy who was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it in um,</v>

1378
01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.880
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in Minnesota.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was running around stabbing people</v>

1379
01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:09.680
<v Speaker 2>and then some guy who was a concealed</v>
<v Speaker 2>carry permit holder pulled out his gun</v>

1380
01:02:09.690 --> 01:02:12.000
<v Speaker 2>and shot the guy and killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was a,</v>

1381
01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:13.460
<v Speaker 2>one of those things that people point to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1382
01:02:13.461 --> 01:02:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy was a competition shooter</v>

1383
01:02:15.590 --> 01:02:18.770
<v Speaker 2>concealed carry permit and any save</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's lives because this guy was</v>

1384
01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 2>killing a bunch of people.</v>

1385
01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.820
<v Speaker 2>But those case studies compared to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>case studies that go wrong,</v>

1386
01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:26.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the metrics,</v>

1387
01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.600
<v Speaker 2>but I bet there what 10 to 1:20 to one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1388
01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:33.000
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way easier to get a gun just to</v>

1389
01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:36.060
<v Speaker 2>just to go and get a gun than it is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>become a competitive shooter.</v>

1390
01:02:36.510 --> 01:02:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Like what that guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the rarest of the rare.</v>

1391
01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Someone is not just competent with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>firearm,</v>

1392
01:02:41.761 --> 01:02:44.880
<v Speaker 2>but an expert level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here he is man who shot crossroads mall.</v>

1393
01:02:44.881 --> 01:02:48.600
<v Speaker 2>Terrorists is us p,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s a competitor.</v>

1394
01:02:48.601 --> 01:02:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Three guns shooter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1395
01:02:50.221 --> 01:02:53.730
<v Speaker 2>So this guy is just a bad ass gun</v>
<v Speaker 2>carrier and that's fine.</v>

1396
01:02:53.731 --> 01:02:57.270
<v Speaker 2>But that is the rarest except right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm positive of it.</v>

1397
01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:58.171
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is real,</v>

1398
01:02:58.171 --> 01:02:59.004
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1399
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.980
<v Speaker 2>So it can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was right.</v>

1400
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:06.810
<v Speaker 2>So his thought was one day if I am</v>
<v Speaker 2>carrying a gun,</v>

1401
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.370
<v Speaker 2>I'll be able to save people's lives.</v>

1402
01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.390
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1403
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:11.130
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I and protect myself.</v>

1404
01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:11.993
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>

1405
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.460
<v Speaker 2>But the hundreds of others that go</v>
<v Speaker 2>along,</v>

1406
01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:18.690
<v Speaker 2>then somehow there's so many loopholes</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the system of crazy people who get</v>

1407
01:03:18.691 --> 01:03:21.860
<v Speaker 2>guns and go to sandy hook and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1408
01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:24.000
<v Speaker 2>it's slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a terrible example.</v>

1409
01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:27.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are illegally acquired gun.</v>

1410
01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:30.720
<v Speaker 2>That's a gun that was acquired by a</v>
<v Speaker 2>person who is mentally ill and his</v>

1411
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.330
<v Speaker 2>parents didn't protect the guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1412
01:03:33.331 --> 01:03:34.710
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a different story.</v>

1413
01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:35.610
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1414
01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:38.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think that the risk versus reward</v>

1415
01:03:38.971 --> 01:03:41.490
<v Speaker 2>is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just far too unbalanced,</v>

1416
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:45.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's definitely it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ability to shoot someone and kill</v>

1417
01:03:45.451 --> 01:03:48.810
<v Speaker 2>someone by pulling that little tiny</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle on your finger is kind of crazy.</v>

1418
01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:52.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's the amount of power that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have in doing so.</v>

1419
01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:55.260
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a glitch in the matrix using</v>

1420
01:03:55.261 --> 01:03:56.690
<v Speaker 2>matrix analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is,</v>

1421
01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:58.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a glitch in the matrix man and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1422
01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:02.580
<v Speaker 2>it plays into kind of every fallacy of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human condition,</v>

1423
01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:04.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like why?</v>

1424
01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:08.400
<v Speaker 2>How did we let that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did we make it so easy to take</v>

1425
01:04:08.401 --> 01:04:11.550
<v Speaker 2>someone else's life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you say if I may.</v>

1426
01:04:11.551 --> 01:04:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you the president of United States?</v>

1427
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:17.280
<v Speaker 2>Does the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does Zach Larry say no more military</v>

1428
01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.730
<v Speaker 2>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He say police officers can't have guns.</v>

1429
01:04:20.731 --> 01:04:22.920
<v Speaker 2>We all need love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody gets their guns taken away.</v>

1430
01:04:22.921 --> 01:04:24.630
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you deal with everything?</v>

1431
01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:25.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1432
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not something that you can just</v>

1433
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:28.980
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1434
01:04:28.981 --> 01:04:30.360
<v Speaker 2>It's not something you can just do</v>
<v Speaker 2>overnight.</v>

1435
01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1436
01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:34.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>naive enough or you know,</v>

1437
01:04:34.111 --> 01:04:37.640
<v Speaker 2>stoned enough or meditate enough to</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that that we should get high,</v>

1438
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:40.940
<v Speaker 2>maybe we think about in a different way</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there,</v>

1439
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:44.400
<v Speaker 2>and there were already 300 million guns</v>
<v Speaker 2>in America.</v>

1440
01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.490
<v Speaker 2>I think there's more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there are more guns in America</v>

1441
01:04:47.491 --> 01:04:48.510
<v Speaker 2>than there are human beings.</v>

1442
01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:51.570
<v Speaker 2>And here's what's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like we're like,</v>

1443
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.320
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're good.</v>

1444
01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.360
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're fucking making guns like crazy.</v>

1445
01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we're sitting here,</v>

1446
01:04:56.161 --> 01:04:57.090
<v Speaker 2>the chunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chunk,</v>

1447
01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:57.940
<v Speaker 2>chunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chunk,</v>

1448
01:04:57.940 --> 01:05:00.390
<v Speaker 2>chunk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>machines are turning out gun.</v>

1449
01:05:00.391 --> 01:05:02.580
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly who becomes president.</v>

1450
01:05:02.581 --> 01:05:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I know it's highly unpopular and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>will get pissed at me,</v>

1451
01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:11.400
<v Speaker 2>but we stopped the sale of all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you have a very specific kind of</v>

1452
01:05:11.401 --> 01:05:15.060
<v Speaker 2>UK style hunting exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you eat meat?</v>

1453
01:05:15.450 --> 01:05:16.490
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do?</v>

1454
01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:19.270
<v Speaker 2>I didn't for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do again.</v>

1455
01:05:19.271 --> 01:05:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Why'd you start again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1456
01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:23.980
<v Speaker 2>I got sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not from not eating meat.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1458
01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:27.970

<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1460
01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:33.100

<v Speaker 2>I mean it was like a terrible flu and</v>

1461
01:05:33.101 --> 01:05:35.260
<v Speaker 2>all I could think about was I want a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey sandwich</v>

<v Speaker 2>better and I never went back.</v>

1475
01:06:06.450 --> 01:06:07.530
<v Speaker 2>I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a,</v>

1476
01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:12.940
<v Speaker 2>a loosely in the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a god Damn airport you got me in the</v>

1477
01:06:12.941 --> 01:06:14.710
<v Speaker 2>airport and I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1478
01:06:14.711 --> 01:06:17.290
<v Speaker 2>I always get to the airport way too</v>
<v Speaker 2>early because I just,</v>

1479
01:06:17.291 --> 01:06:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I liked being in the airport early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to be in that.</v>

1480
01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:24.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like a neutral zone between there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here and just I love it.</v>

1481
01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:26.440
<v Speaker 2>I love hanging around the airport and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>get there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>time with blueberry muffins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chocolate croissants.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That was my shit and I'm a sucker for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the egg mcmuffin.</v>

1485
01:06:38.850 --> 01:06:40.270
<v Speaker 2>Sadly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are good.</v>

1486
01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.610
<v Speaker 2>They taste good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the worst thing in the world</v>

1487
01:06:42.611 --> 01:06:43.600
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite honestly.</v>

1488
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:45.010
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not for the.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The Ham factory farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1490
01:06:47.591 --> 01:06:48.520
<v Speaker 2>It's not the worst thing in the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

1491
01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:52.060
<v Speaker 2>but Mcdonald's is the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what am I going to do?</v>

1492
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the best I can really do.</v>

1493
01:06:56.140 --> 01:06:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird world.</v>

1494
01:06:57.581 --> 01:06:59.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of vegans would disagree with</v>

1495
01:06:59.051 --> 01:06:59.561
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would say,</v>

1496
01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:00.880
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you definitely not doing the best you</v>

1497
01:07:00.881 --> 01:07:03.170
<v Speaker 2>can if you're out there eating egg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1498
01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:05.170
<v Speaker 2>That's not the best you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fair.</v>

1499
01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.000
<v Speaker 2>Fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

1500
01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:07.863
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meat.</v>

1501
01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.620
<v Speaker 2>Vegans and I argue a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they do?</v>

1502
01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:11.633
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1503
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:14.350
<v Speaker 2>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you are on the social media,</v>

1504
01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:15.910
<v Speaker 2>um.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1505
01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:16.940
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1506
01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:20.290
<v Speaker 2>and it's weird because I'm kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophically,</v>

1507
01:07:20.291 --> 01:07:23.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm on their side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm with philosophically,</v>

1508
01:07:23.201 --> 01:07:25.460
<v Speaker 2>but not in practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just add to,</v>

1509
01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.810
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't feel I'm not quite ready for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and I have to admit I'm just not,</v>

1510
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am where I am.</v>

1511
01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:32.340
<v Speaker 2>I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I argued with him about is,</v>

1512
01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:33.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1513
01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:37.810
<v Speaker 2>it's a constant social media argument is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we are omnivores.</v>

1514
01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:39.280
<v Speaker 2>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1515
01:07:39.281 --> 01:07:41.440
<v Speaker 2>We definitely are omnivores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We eat what's around us.</v>

1516
01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We always have.</v>

1517
01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.800
<v Speaker 2>There's a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can cruelty free meat,</v>

1518
01:07:44.801 --> 01:07:47.560
<v Speaker 2>but there's a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a way where you could have</v>

1519
01:07:47.561 --> 01:07:52.561
<v Speaker 2>cruelty free mass consumption that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>real problem is cities like,</v>

1520
01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:55.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you have a co op where you guys</v>

1521
01:07:55.211 --> 01:07:57.130
<v Speaker 2>are growing your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the second part?</v>

1522
01:07:57.131 --> 01:07:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

1523
01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:00.820
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not you can eat cruelty free,</v>

1524
01:08:00.821 --> 01:08:04.690
<v Speaker 2>but you can't put in a mask consumption</v>
<v Speaker 2>like environment,</v>

1525
01:08:04.691 --> 01:08:06.790
<v Speaker 2>like 7 million people living in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan,</v>

1526
01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:11.230
<v Speaker 2>like good luck getting cruelty free meat</v>
<v Speaker 2>to all 7 million people cowspiracy</v>

1527
01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:13.260
<v Speaker 2>inside that area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1528
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:14.470
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to bring it.</v>

1529
01:08:14.471 --> 01:08:15.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we've done</v>

1530
01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:21.580
<v Speaker 3>over the last 150 years is moved</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely away from agriculture in,</v>

1531
01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:24.830
<v Speaker 3>in these cities and and drive things in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and trucks.</v>

1532
01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.010
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen some of the old</v>
<v Speaker 3>models of what they were?</v>

1533
01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.750
<v Speaker 3>The way that when they were planning</v>
<v Speaker 3>cities,</v>

1534
01:08:29.751 --> 01:08:33.890
<v Speaker 3>like in the early 18 hundreds when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>were designing New York and a couple</v>

1535
01:08:33.891 --> 01:08:37.550
<v Speaker 3>other cities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had set up areas for agriculture</v>

1536
01:08:37.551 --> 01:08:42.551
<v Speaker 3>areas for livestock and they had them in</v>
<v Speaker 3>cities and so they didn't have this</v>

1537
01:08:43.791 --> 01:08:46.790
<v Speaker 3>notion that we have now that everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be driven in and trucks because</v>

1538
01:08:46.791 --> 01:08:49.310
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when they had.</v>

1539
01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.290
<v Speaker 3>When they had cities in the 17,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds and later there,</v>

1540
01:08:53.690 --> 01:08:57.550
<v Speaker 3>there was no way to get all that food to</v>
<v Speaker 3>millions and millions of people,</v>

1541
01:08:57.551 --> 01:08:59.900
<v Speaker 3>so they literally had a gross stuff in</v>
<v Speaker 3>cities,</v>

1542
01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:03.500
<v Speaker 3>which is a way better way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Michael Pollan.</v>

1543
01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:05.880
<v Speaker 3>Omnivore's dilemma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1544
01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.740
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's also getting into psychedelics now,</v>

1545
01:09:09.741 --> 01:09:13.520
<v Speaker 3>which is pretty cool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just recently he's doing some really</v>

1546
01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.850
<v Speaker 3>interesting who was a wonderful person</v>
<v Speaker 3>who popped him into the matrix that I</v>

1547
01:09:16.851 --> 01:09:18.050
<v Speaker 3>don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm gonna use the matrix.</v>

1548
01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:20.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm in touch with them and going to do a</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast with him.</v>

1549
01:09:20.061 --> 01:09:20.691
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>

1550
01:09:20.691 --> 01:09:22.010
<v Speaker 3>Figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1551
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:23.840
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean his whole kind of,</v>

1552
01:09:23.900 --> 01:09:25.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Omnivore's dilemma and some of</v>

1553
01:09:25.701 --> 01:09:28.190
<v Speaker 3>those other books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the biggest problem with our food</v>

1554
01:09:28.191 --> 01:09:33.191
<v Speaker 3>supplies that we have lost our</v>
<v Speaker 3>connection to how food got there up</v>

1555
01:09:33.231 --> 01:09:35.260
<v Speaker 3>until 100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100,</v>

1556
01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:38.420
<v Speaker 3>maybe 120 at the turn of the century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 19th and the 20th century.</v>

1557
01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:42.650
<v Speaker 3>Every body had a relationship with their</v>
<v Speaker 3>food.</v>

1558
01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:45.500
<v Speaker 3>They knew you went to the produce</v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

1559
01:09:45.501 --> 01:09:47.850
<v Speaker 3>It didn't come from a shelf in a box,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1560
01:09:47.851 --> 01:09:50.810
<v Speaker 3>you had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you knew where it was sourced and it was</v>

1561
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:52.030
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you ate meat,</v>

1562
01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.140
<v Speaker 3>you kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you saw the bloodiness and you've just</v>

1563
01:09:54.141 --> 01:09:57.200
<v Speaker 3>saw like even if you didn't kill it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>slaughtered and butchered you,</v>

1564
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:58.880
<v Speaker 3>you knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1565
01:09:58.881 --> 01:10:01.550
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't this prepackaged thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>just comes from magic,</v>

1566
01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:02.780
<v Speaker 3>the bacon very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1567
01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.210
<v Speaker 3>and that that's our problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1568
01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Food comes from the shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody understands.</v>

1569
01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:10.490
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a giant disconnect with</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

1570
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:14.300
<v Speaker 3>it's so many people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is like it used to be that a</v>

1571
01:10:14.301 --> 01:10:17.540
<v Speaker 3>few people were disconnected and most</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were connected and now it's</v>

1572
01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:21.080
<v Speaker 3>completely turned on its head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you have 20 million people in</v>

1573
01:10:21.081 --> 01:10:25.820
<v Speaker 3>Los Angeles and what percentage of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 million people in Los Angeles acquire</v>

1574
01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:29.030
<v Speaker 3>their own food from either growing</v>
<v Speaker 3>plants or hunting,</v>

1575
01:10:29.031 --> 01:10:30.390
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one's not.</v>

1576
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:31.790
<v Speaker 3>Almost none.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Zero point one,</v>

1577
01:10:31.791 --> 01:10:32.360
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one,</v>

1578
01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:35.750
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of crazy when you consider</v>

1579
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:39.410
<v Speaker 3>that it's an essential part of being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>person is consuming food.</v>

1580
01:10:39.411 --> 01:10:42.890
<v Speaker 3>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also this beautiful feeling that</v>

1581
01:10:42.891 --> 01:10:47.390
<v Speaker 3>you get and the vegans have this feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

1582
01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:52.420
<v Speaker 3>When you grow your own food and you grow</v>
<v Speaker 3>food in a garden and you pick your salad</v>

1583
01:10:53.121 --> 01:10:56.060
<v Speaker 3>and cut up your cucumbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this all came from the ground right</v>

1584
01:10:56.061 --> 01:10:58.670
<v Speaker 3>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was a really interesting</v>

1585
01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:03.920
<v Speaker 3>article that was written by a Vegan that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was essentially saying there are no</v>

1586
01:11:03.921 --> 01:11:08.570
<v Speaker 3>vegetarians and that the only way is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it is actually impossible to be a</v>

1587
01:11:08.571 --> 01:11:09.350
<v Speaker 3>vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

1588
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:12.710
<v Speaker 3>not meaning that it's impossible for you</v>
<v Speaker 3>to live and eat vegetables,</v>

1589
01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:17.930
<v Speaker 3>but those vegetables need dead animals</v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to be alive and that animals</v>

1590
01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:23.610
<v Speaker 3>are consumed by plants and that is what</v>
<v Speaker 3>fertilizer is all about and whether or</v>

1591
01:11:23.611 --> 01:11:25.770
<v Speaker 3>not it's the fertilizer was just the</v>
<v Speaker 3>poop.</v>

1592
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:26.910
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1593
01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:30.030
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of it is actual decaying</v>

1594
01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.420
<v Speaker 3>matter and in order to be healthy in</v>
<v Speaker 3>particular,</v>

1595
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:34.980
<v Speaker 3>like what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of them,</v>

1596
01:11:34.981 --> 01:11:37.350
<v Speaker 3>you know about Fritz Hobert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what the harbor methodists</v>

1597
01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:39.750
<v Speaker 3>don't know in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during World War One,</v>

1598
01:11:39.751 --> 01:11:42.780
<v Speaker 3>there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a German scientist named Fritz harbor,</v>

1599
01:11:42.781 --> 01:11:46.260
<v Speaker 3>and he came up with the harbor method of</v>
<v Speaker 3>extracting nitrogen from the air.</v>

1600
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Most people think of the air as being</v>
<v Speaker 3>oxygen,</v>

1601
01:11:48.991 --> 01:11:51.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The air is 78 percent,</v>

1602
01:11:51.631 --> 01:11:52.770
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nitrogen,</v>

1603
01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:56.250
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you can extract that nitrogen from</v>

1604
01:11:56.251 --> 01:12:01.080
<v Speaker 3>the air and use it as fertilizer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so because of Fritz harbor,</v>

1605
01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.580
<v Speaker 3>they have been able to extract this</v>
<v Speaker 3>nitrogen and use it to fertilize plants</v>

1606
01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:10.610
<v Speaker 3>because before they used like emulsified</v>
<v Speaker 3>fish and the fish was like a big one,</v>

1607
01:12:11.491 --> 01:12:15.810
<v Speaker 3>like dead fish and fish bones and things</v>
<v Speaker 3>along those lines because that is when</v>

1608
01:12:15.811 --> 01:12:17.490
<v Speaker 3>it decays and breaks down.</v>

1609
01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:20.850
<v Speaker 3>That is the food for these plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1610
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:25.910
<v Speaker 3>So what would a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would the vegans opposed this in the</v>

1611
01:12:27.391 --> 01:12:29.900
<v Speaker 3>sense that we're opposing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not?</v>

1612
01:12:30.090 --> 01:12:30.750
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1613
01:12:30.750 --> 01:12:33.960
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just what he wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy who wrote it was a Vegan,</v>

1614
01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:37.350
<v Speaker 3>but essentially we're saying that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this massive cycle life and even</v>

1615
01:12:37.351 --> 01:12:39.490
<v Speaker 3>pointed to Michael Pollan's work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1616
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:44.660
<v Speaker 3>because Paula has written about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>emerging science of sentient plant life</v>

1617
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:52.790
<v Speaker 3>and that he believes that what's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on with plants is very similar to what's</v>

1618
01:12:53.881 --> 01:12:58.170
<v Speaker 3>going on with like maybe our</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding of a lot of different</v>

1619
01:12:58.320 --> 01:12:59.970
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like as our,</v>

1620
01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:02.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>understanding expands,</v>

1621
01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:05.430
<v Speaker 3>we have to sorta reclassify what we</v>
<v Speaker 3>think those things are.</v>

1622
01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.120
<v Speaker 3>Like for the longest time they thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>that fish couldn't feel pain.</v>

1623
01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:10.290
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was,</v>

1624
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:11.101
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't worry about fish,</v>

1625
01:13:11.101 --> 01:13:12.840
<v Speaker 3>can't feel pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now they're saying,</v>

1626
01:13:12.841 --> 01:13:14.490
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we appreciate it.</v>

1627
01:13:14.490 --> 01:13:15.550
<v Speaker 3>They can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1628
01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:18.120
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have a different understanding of</v>

1629
01:13:18.121 --> 01:13:20.970
<v Speaker 3>what pain is to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be a different sensation,</v>

1630
01:13:20.971 --> 01:13:24.330
<v Speaker 3>but there's very clearly some alarms</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are going off.</v>

1631
01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:28.770
<v Speaker 3>It was very clearly some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction that seemed can be pointed out</v>

1632
01:13:28.771 --> 01:13:32.220
<v Speaker 3>for plants like plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only do they have a reaction,</v>

1633
01:13:32.221 --> 01:13:35.070
<v Speaker 3>but plants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you play the sound of caterpillars,</v>

1634
01:13:35.071 --> 01:13:38.400
<v Speaker 3>chewing leaves certain plans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Acacia tree,</v>

1635
01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:40.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has the ability,</v>

1636
01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:45.360
<v Speaker 3>when it hears leaves being chewed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it changes the taste of the leaves that</v>

1637
01:13:45.361 --> 01:13:50.361
<v Speaker 3>extract some sort of a chemical and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical does something to the taste of</v>

1638
01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:56.220
<v Speaker 3>plants that makes them so an addable</v>
<v Speaker 3>that some animals have starved to death</v>

1639
01:13:56.430 --> 01:14:01.430
<v Speaker 3>because upwind there were animals that</v>
<v Speaker 3>were chewing plants that sound came</v>

1640
01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:06.810
<v Speaker 3>downwind through either smell or some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a communication thing</v>

1641
01:14:06.811 --> 01:14:09.270
<v Speaker 3>that's going on with the mycelium and</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

1642
01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:12.040
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the root structure and the plants down</v>

1643
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:15.640
<v Speaker 2>wind had changed their tastes and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>animals wouldn't eat them anymore and</v>

1644
01:14:15.641 --> 01:14:16.810
<v Speaker 2>they were starving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1645
01:14:16.811 --> 01:14:17.890
<v Speaker 2>That's far out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1646
01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:21.810
<v Speaker 2>That just kinda makes me think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's gonna be the next sort of like</v>

1647
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Vegan movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe some kind of IOWASCA ceremony in</v>

1648
01:14:25.511 --> 01:14:30.420
<v Speaker 2>the middle of like a of a garden or like</v>
<v Speaker 2>an agricultural thing where we're just,</v>

1649
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:33.010
<v Speaker 2>we're listening for and trying to make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1650
01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:38.830
<v Speaker 2>we have to make peace with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything needs everything else in</v>

1651
01:14:38.831 --> 01:14:40.410
<v Speaker 2>order to make it well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1652
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:44.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a like a suffering and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect thing,</v>

1653
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:45.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1654
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:49.690
<v Speaker 2>And then then you also have to consider</v>
<v Speaker 2>if plants are sentient life forms,</v>

1655
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:54.990
<v Speaker 2>how fucked up is it to have these</v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic large scale agricultural setups</v>

1656
01:14:55.721 --> 01:14:59.020
<v Speaker 2>where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are completely unnaturally changing</v>

1657
01:14:59.021 --> 01:15:03.940
<v Speaker 2>the landscape in order to grow corn or</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to grow lettuce or strawberry.</v>

1658
01:15:03.941 --> 01:15:05.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like that is not normal.</v>

1659
01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:09.730
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not normal to have 7,000 acres</v>
<v Speaker 2>of corn.</v>

1660
01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:13.000
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in just corn all in a neat row that</v>

1661
01:15:13.001 --> 01:15:16.060
<v Speaker 2>you could see from space and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's destroying the soil to.</v>

1662
01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:16.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely.</v>

1663
01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:20.680
<v Speaker 2>It's completely destroying the soil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like with this idea of like having,</v>

1664
01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:25.770
<v Speaker 2>you said respect and in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of getting into that idea like do</v>

1665
01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:27.910
<v Speaker 2>you think um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

1666
01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:30.910
<v Speaker 2>my opinion is results may vary and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so sure.</v>

1667
01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:35.940
<v Speaker 2>But if everybody had the data and saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>the data about factory farming for</v>

1668
01:15:35.951 --> 01:15:39.700
<v Speaker 2>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they would change in us,</v>

1669
01:15:39.730 --> 01:15:42.520
<v Speaker 2>act accordingly and not eat that shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1670
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:44.850
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't give a final.</v>

1671
01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:47.680
<v Speaker 2>I think some people's doing fuck and</v>
<v Speaker 2>those Gordon Gekko type dudes,</v>

1672
01:15:47.681 --> 01:15:49.480
<v Speaker 2>the slicked back hair that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

1673
01:15:49.481 --> 01:15:51.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to win Gimme that burden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump,</v>

1674
01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:51.911
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>

1675
01:15:51.911 --> 01:15:52.420
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump.</v>

1676
01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've thought about myself.</v>

1677
01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:55.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen every one of those movies.</v>

1678
01:15:55.451 --> 01:15:56.830
<v Speaker 2>I've read every book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1679
01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:00.760
<v Speaker 2>I didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have a muffin from time to time and</v>

1680
01:16:00.761 --> 01:16:02.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is wrong with me?</v>

1681
01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:05.980
<v Speaker 2>Like is there something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I associate to do that?</v>

1682
01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:07.990
<v Speaker 2>Because it's easy to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody said,</v>

1683
01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:08.853
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hungry,</v>

1684
01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:12.880
<v Speaker 2>why don't you shoot that pig in the head</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a cut off a leg and throw it on the</v>

1685
01:16:12.881 --> 01:16:14.980
<v Speaker 2>smoker?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then you would have a real issue.</v>

1686
01:16:14.981 --> 01:16:16.060
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do that.</v>

1687
01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why don't you pull those beets out</v>

1688
01:16:17.861 --> 01:16:18.970
<v Speaker 2>of the ground?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1689
01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:22.180
<v Speaker 2>if you put on these headphones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can hear the beat scream or their</v>

1690
01:16:22.181 --> 01:16:22.811
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1691
01:16:22.811 --> 01:16:23.940
<v Speaker 2>AH,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck off.</v>

1692
01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1693
01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:28.630
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anybody knows,</v>

1694
01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:32.050
<v Speaker 2>but if there's just something about</v>
<v Speaker 2>plausible deniability that's kind of</v>

1695
01:16:32.051 --> 01:16:34.150
<v Speaker 2>hardwired into us in all aspects of her</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1696
01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Not just food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but war and politics and money and greed</v>

1697
01:16:37.841 --> 01:16:41.020
<v Speaker 2>and oil and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it takes to get oil to this</v>

1698
01:16:41.021 --> 01:16:43.730
<v Speaker 2>damn country and everything that goes on</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fill up our car.</v>

1699
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:46.690
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A plausible deniability is definitely</v>

1700
01:16:46.691 --> 01:16:50.230
<v Speaker 2>the way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The extreme ability to detach ourselves</v>

1701
01:16:50.231 --> 01:16:52.660
<v Speaker 2>from the consequences of our actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1702
01:16:52.690 --> 01:16:54.720
<v Speaker 2>because it's convenient in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1703
01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And convenient in the moment to just buy</v>

1704
01:16:57.191 --> 01:17:00.160
<v Speaker 2>that quarter pounder with cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Think about it that it's a ground</v>

1705
01:17:00.161 --> 01:17:04.620
<v Speaker 2>animal burger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1706
01:17:05.190 --> 01:17:06.790
<v Speaker 2>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1707
01:17:06.791 --> 01:17:08.680
<v Speaker 2>it's only going to cost me two bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1708
01:17:08.681 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 2>And you get away from that,</v>

1709
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.240
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1710
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:15.770
<v Speaker 1>it really is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't connected to such horrific</v>

1711
01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:18.290
<v Speaker 1>crimes against nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

1712
01:17:18.330 --> 01:17:20.140
<v Speaker 1>What's amazing that you can just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

1713
01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:23.810
<v Speaker 1>what an incredible system they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed outside of food.</v>

1714
01:17:23.811 --> 01:17:27.590
<v Speaker 1>Just what you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economic factors for how convenience</v>

1715
01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.360
<v Speaker 1>equals pleasure equals like an economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>value that is usually low.</v>

1716
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:36.260
<v Speaker 1>How that has all sort of work together</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of create this system that we're</v>

1717
01:17:36.261 --> 01:17:41.150
<v Speaker 1>living in now and we have this again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this plausible deniability kind of</v>

1718
01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:45.050
<v Speaker 1>hardwired thing to ignore it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know Walmart is a great example.</v>

1719
01:17:45.051 --> 01:17:45.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1720
01:17:45.690 --> 01:17:48.830
<v Speaker 1>the sort of this disenfranchised middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the country,</v>

1721
01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:50.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they did lose their jobs in that</v>

1722
01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:53.120
<v Speaker 1>area of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the country's decimated,</v>

1723
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:56.060
<v Speaker 1>but they all shop at Walmart and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1724
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:59.180
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of what the heart of what</v>

1725
01:17:59.181 --> 01:18:00.014
<v Speaker 1>the problem is.</v>

1726
01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:01.820
<v Speaker 1>It's cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's convenient.</v>

1727
01:18:01.821 --> 01:18:03.350
<v Speaker 1>You're still going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1728
01:18:03.351 --> 01:18:05.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it going to be?</v>

1729
01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick a horse that's been interesting is</v>

1730
01:18:07.131 --> 01:18:08.720
<v Speaker 1>that this is all really recent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1731
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:13.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is all from the industrial</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution on this is all this last</v>

1732
01:18:13.281 --> 01:18:18.170
<v Speaker 1>couple of hundred years of civilization</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we've sort of entered into this</v>

1733
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:21.880
<v Speaker 1>wage existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1734
01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:26.890
<v Speaker 1>where people are living this way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying this horrible fucking factory</v>

1735
01:18:27.681 --> 01:18:31.050
<v Speaker 1>produced food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even more recent that,</v>

1736
01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:31.611
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1737
01:18:31.611 --> 01:18:34.760
<v Speaker 1>it's all can be traced back to the post</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial revolution stuff,</v>

1738
01:18:34.761 --> 01:18:38.090
<v Speaker 1>but even just like the massive high</v>
<v Speaker 1>perkins can consumerism,</v>

1739
01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:41.900
<v Speaker 1>that's only really taken off since the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mid nineties.</v>

1740
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a cool little movie out called</v>

1741
01:18:44.811 --> 01:18:46.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the minimalists.</v>

1742
01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:48.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after awhile it kind of,</v>

1743
01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:48.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1744
01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:50.630
<v Speaker 1>I got it and I didn't finish the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1745
01:18:50.631 --> 01:18:52.160
<v Speaker 1>But the first hour is fascinating.</v>

1746
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:55.370
<v Speaker 1>It's about these guys that wrote a book</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the minimalists and about,</v>

1747
01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:56.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1748
01:18:56.301 --> 01:18:59.600
<v Speaker 1>there were all kinds of corporate ladder</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of American successful guys and</v>

1749
01:18:59.601 --> 01:19:00.670
<v Speaker 1>just consuming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consuming,</v>

1750
01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:01.690
<v Speaker 1>buying shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying Shin,</v>

1751
01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:03.080
<v Speaker 1>buying shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden they just kind of</v>

1752
01:19:03.081 --> 01:19:05.270
<v Speaker 1>had the kind of big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of cliched awakening.</v>

1753
01:19:05.271 --> 01:19:05.811
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1754
01:19:05.811 --> 01:19:10.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe I don't need all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the data that they present from</v>

1755
01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:15.290
<v Speaker 1>what's happened in the mid nineties on</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of as a result of the internet boom</v>

1756
01:19:15.291 --> 01:19:19.280
<v Speaker 1>with instant gratification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one click shopping and disassociation of</v>

1757
01:19:19.281 --> 01:19:23.720
<v Speaker 1>just the accumulation of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we live in,</v>

1758
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:24.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1759
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:26.840
<v Speaker 1>we live in bigger houses now than we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever lived.</v>

1760
01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Square footage wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've never been so big before and</v>

1761
01:19:31.071 --> 01:19:31.880
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1762
01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:34.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've put all these heat maps on a,</v>

1763
01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.730
<v Speaker 1>they did the study where they put heat</v>
<v Speaker 1>maps on these homes to see where people</v>

1764
01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:42.170
<v Speaker 1>were living in the homes hanging out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the average family and like they're</v>

1765
01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:46.130
<v Speaker 1>huge kind of mansion or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only uses like 40 percent of the house.</v>

1766
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense.</v>

1767
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:50.690
<v Speaker 1>And also has a self storage unit to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it somewhere else,</v>

1768
01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:53.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just this endless kind of</v>

1769
01:19:53.451 --> 01:19:56.540
<v Speaker 1>relationship we have with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I watched hoarders the other night</v>

1770
01:19:57.470 --> 01:20:01.070
<v Speaker 1>and there were some digital hardcore</v>
<v Speaker 1>bought two houses next to his house</v>

1771
01:20:01.071 --> 01:20:05.480
<v Speaker 1>because he had so much shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had to move the shit to other houses.</v>

1772
01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:08.300
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orders</v>

1773
01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:10.890
<v Speaker 2>is gnarly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is a weird hoarder because it</v>

1774
01:20:10.891 --> 01:20:13.920
<v Speaker 2>was a guy who had some money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He bought two ounces.</v>

1775
01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:15.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't like a hoarder,</v>

1776
01:20:15.691 --> 01:20:19.560
<v Speaker 2>like some poor person that was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>yard sales and buying used clothes.</v>

1777
01:20:19.561 --> 01:20:22.590
<v Speaker 2>And then putting them in bags and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>house and stack them up the ceiling with</v>

1778
01:20:22.591 --> 01:20:24.930
<v Speaker 2>newspapers and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a guy who had all these</v>

1779
01:20:24.931 --> 01:20:28.050
<v Speaker 2>collectibles and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a neurosurgeon,</v>

1780
01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:29.570
<v Speaker 2>which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really interesting.</v>

1781
01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1782
01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:34.380
<v Speaker 2>He lives in Vegas and he wanted to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>known for his collection.</v>

1783
01:20:34.381 --> 01:20:36.360
<v Speaker 2>He had crazy stuff like he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1784
01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:39.690
<v Speaker 2>there within two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a lot of space memorabilia.</v>

1785
01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Like he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1786
01:20:41.631 --> 01:20:46.631
<v Speaker 2>a scale model of one of the challengers</v>
<v Speaker 2>or one of the space shuttles rather.</v>

1787
01:20:47.150 --> 01:20:48.000
<v Speaker 2>He had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1788
01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:53.090
<v Speaker 2>one of the test lunar modules that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong</v>

1789
01:20:54.421 --> 01:20:59.421
<v Speaker 2>apparently had used in testing and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>preparation for the Apollo missions and</v>

1790
01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:02.970
<v Speaker 2>hit a bunch of crazy shit all over his</v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

1791
01:21:02.970 --> 01:21:07.800
<v Speaker 2>But he had three houses fill this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The courtyards and all around his pool</v>

1792
01:21:07.801 --> 01:21:09.870
<v Speaker 2>was stacked up with shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

1793
01:21:10.770 --> 01:21:12.180
<v Speaker 2>that's so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just</v>

1794
01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:18.000
<v Speaker 2>escapism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This need to sort of like pacify our</v>

1795
01:21:18.001 --> 01:21:19.310
<v Speaker 2>existence here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1796
01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:22.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we kind of evolve and kind of grow</v>

1797
01:21:22.021 --> 01:21:24.540
<v Speaker 2>into the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just seems like so few people can</v>

1798
01:21:24.541 --> 01:21:28.230
<v Speaker 2>truly be comfortable in their own skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just be,</v>

1799
01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:31.530
<v Speaker 2>be present and be comfortable and</v>
<v Speaker 2>content contentness.</v>

1800
01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:34.800
<v Speaker 2>We're constantly inventing new ways to</v>
<v Speaker 2>escape,</v>

1801
01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:37.620
<v Speaker 2>to disassociate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get out of the moment.</v>

1802
01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:41.040
<v Speaker 2>What do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is so compelling to us</v>

1803
01:21:41.041 --> 01:21:46.041
<v Speaker 2>about the constant accumulation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>material possessions and Ms Dot hold.</v>

1804
01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:50.100
<v Speaker 2>Greed is good sort of mentality and</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving up the corporate ladder without</v>

1805
01:21:50.101 --> 01:21:53.880
<v Speaker 2>any sort of appreciation or acceptance</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that we're these finite</v>

1806
01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:58.350
<v Speaker 2>lifeforms clinging to a spinning orb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurling through infinity,</v>

1807
01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.650
<v Speaker 2>all those inevitable and inescapable</v>
<v Speaker 2>realities.</v>

1808
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1809
01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:04.920
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we look at them every day we look up.</v>

1810
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:07.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is undeniable that you are looking</v>

1811
01:22:07.561 --> 01:22:10.230
<v Speaker 2>up as you leave your house and get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>your car.</v>

1812
01:22:10.530 --> 01:22:14.100
<v Speaker 2>You have infinity above your head and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't look at it.</v>

1813
01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:14.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1814
01:22:14.541 --> 01:22:15.420
<v Speaker 2>what's going on with us?</v>

1815
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:18.440
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1816
01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.860
<v Speaker 2>your were born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that we've kind of created</v>

1817
01:22:22.861 --> 01:22:27.861
<v Speaker 2>this construct that we call society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're automatically born into a bad hand</v>

1818
01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:32.700
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's completely bogus.</v>

1819
01:22:32.701 --> 01:22:36.420
<v Speaker 2>You're dealt a bad hand at birth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even matter if you're born</v>

1820
01:22:36.421 --> 01:22:37.320
<v Speaker 2>into privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1821
01:22:37.321 --> 01:22:38.071
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great.</v>

1822
01:22:38.071 --> 01:22:41.100
<v Speaker 2>If you're born into privilege versus the</v>
<v Speaker 2>slums of Mumbai does.</v>

1823
01:22:41.101 --> 01:22:41.934
<v Speaker 2>Definitely better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1824
01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:42.960
<v Speaker 2>that's definitely better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1825
01:22:42.961 --> 01:22:45.360
<v Speaker 2>of course I'm not going to be falling in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beverly Hills.</v>

1826
01:22:45.970 --> 01:22:48.050
<v Speaker 2>It's way better than Liberia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1827
01:22:48.051 --> 01:22:50.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bentley convertible.</v>

1828
01:22:50.581 --> 01:22:53.400
<v Speaker 2>Did you do in way better than someone in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zaire with no feet?</v>

1829
01:22:54.810 --> 01:22:55.860
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No question,</v>

1830
01:22:55.861 --> 01:22:57.040
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1831
01:22:57.050 --> 01:23:00.160
<v Speaker 2>you're dealt a bad hand of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1832
01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:02.170
<v Speaker 2>being alive as hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1833
01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1834

1836
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:07.240
<v Speaker 1>from ages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1837
01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:09.880
<v Speaker 1>When you go to school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just for is that about right?</v>

1838
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Some people go to preschool at for</v>
<v Speaker 1>kindergarten is five,</v>

1839
01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.430
<v Speaker 1>first grade six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four to 18.</v>

1840
01:23:15.431 --> 01:23:18.760
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go into this big cement</v>
<v Speaker 1>building to be taught these certain</v>

1841
01:23:18.761 --> 01:23:21.440
<v Speaker 1>subjects in this certain order and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to leave that cement</v>

1842
01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:23.260
<v Speaker 1>building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into another one that's even more</v>

1843
01:23:23.261 --> 01:23:26.800
<v Speaker 1>expensive and then you're going to leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and you're going to get some kind</v>

1844
01:23:26.801 --> 01:23:30.640
<v Speaker 1>of employment thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which exists pretty much from nine to</v>

1845
01:23:30.641 --> 01:23:32.920
<v Speaker 1>five for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're fortunate,</v>

1846
01:23:32.921 --> 01:23:36.490
<v Speaker 1>are clever enough to kind of exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of that framework and create</v>

1847
01:23:36.491 --> 01:23:38.890
<v Speaker 1>your own reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most people are going to work some</v>

1848
01:23:38.891 --> 01:23:43.300
<v Speaker 1>kind of structured life and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hard.</v>

1849
01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:47.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just hard to be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It definitely is.</v>

1850
01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not harder than it's ever been.</v>

1851
01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:51.730
<v Speaker 1>It's easier than it's ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1852
01:23:51.731 --> 01:23:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more safe than it's ever been seen.</v>

1853
01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Much more access to information than</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever before.</v>

1854
01:23:59.170 --> 01:23:59.981
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1855
01:23:59.981 --> 01:24:01.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is in some aspects it's</v>

1856
01:24:01.961 --> 01:24:03.220
<v Speaker 1>harder because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1857
01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:04.500
<v Speaker 1>well I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1858
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:07.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true because back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the olden times you did have to,</v>

1859
01:24:07.841 --> 01:24:08.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1860
01:24:08.801 --> 01:24:10.750
<v Speaker 1>kind of compete against each other for</v>
<v Speaker 1>survival.</v>

1861
01:24:10.751 --> 01:24:15.751
<v Speaker 1>But I think it could be argued that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>harder because this constant sort of,</v>

1862
01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:19.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>onslaught of media and comparing</v>

1863
01:24:19.511 --> 01:24:21.790
<v Speaker 1>ourselves to each other and to feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>insecure.</v>

1864
01:24:21.791 --> 01:24:24.070
<v Speaker 1>If you don't look like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't look like this,</v>

1865
01:24:24.071 --> 01:24:26.530
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's wrong with you.</v>

1866
01:24:26.531 --> 01:24:29.770
<v Speaker 1>If you can't afford to buy that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing well.</v>

1867
01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:32.530
<v Speaker 1>We're fucking up man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't afford to buy that or if</v>

1868
01:24:32.531 --> 01:24:34.720
<v Speaker 1>you don't look like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1869
01:24:34.721 --> 01:24:36.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's ever going to want to fuck you.</v>

1870
01:24:36.851 --> 01:24:39.010
<v Speaker 1>That's really sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fuck you if you don't</v>

1871
01:24:39.011 --> 01:24:42.310
<v Speaker 1>have the stuff that's awful instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff you've got to have all the</v>

1872
01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:44.920
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a terrible thing to say to</v>

1873
01:24:44.921 --> 01:24:46.210
<v Speaker 1>teach our children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1874
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's hard to be alive.</v>

1875
01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:50.410
<v Speaker 3>It isn't a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very tricky.</v>

1876
01:24:50.411 --> 01:24:53.170
<v Speaker 3>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we are being raised by babies.</v>

1877
01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:59.500
<v Speaker 3>I really do think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I have children and I kinda,</v>

1878
01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:03.450
<v Speaker 3>I kinda get it now in a sense that</v>
<v Speaker 3>before I had children,</v>

1879
01:25:03.451 --> 01:25:05.860
<v Speaker 3>I used to think of people as being sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of static.</v>

1880
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:09.610
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I was younger and when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're real young,</v>

1881
01:25:09.611 --> 01:25:11.200
<v Speaker 3>when you're like 20 or something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1882
01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:15.430
<v Speaker 3>you don't really take into consideration</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the people around you used to be</v>

1883
01:25:15.431 --> 01:25:17.680
<v Speaker 3>your age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You kind of know it in an abstract sort</v>

1884
01:25:17.681 --> 01:25:21.010
<v Speaker 3>of a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once you actually have a baby and</v>

1885
01:25:21.011 --> 01:25:23.890
<v Speaker 3>then like five years later the baby's</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to you and you're having</v>

1886
01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:24.880
<v Speaker 3>conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

1887
01:25:24.881 --> 01:25:26.290
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking learning shit now,</v>

1888
01:25:26.291 --> 01:25:28.600
<v Speaker 3>and then 10 years later they babies in</v>
<v Speaker 3>high school and you're like,</v>

1889
01:25:28.601 --> 01:25:30.010
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're almost a man.</v>

1890
01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.950
<v Speaker 3>And then you realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1891
01:25:32.951 --> 01:25:37.951
<v Speaker 3>we're all babies who had babies and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>raise those babies and then they become</v>

1892
01:25:38.021 --> 01:25:39.820
<v Speaker 3>adults and have babies of their own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

1893
01:25:39.850 --> 01:25:41.980
<v Speaker 3>there are no grownups.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit.</v>

1894
01:25:42.550 --> 01:25:45.940
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're a kid and you're sad,</v>

1895
01:25:45.941 --> 01:25:46.480
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1896
01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.940
<v Speaker 3>one day I'm going to be a grownup and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this is gonna make sense?</v>

1897
01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.730
<v Speaker 3>But it never does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That day never comes you.</v>

1898
01:25:51.900 --> 01:25:54.490
<v Speaker 3>You get older,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're a baby still.</v>

1899
01:25:54.491 --> 01:25:58.420
<v Speaker 3>You're just an old baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're an old baby with a car and</v>

1900
01:25:58.421 --> 01:26:02.740
<v Speaker 3>fucking credit card debt and you have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>baby and then that baby grows up.</v>

1901
01:26:02.741 --> 01:26:04.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm smarter than my dad.</v>

1902
01:26:04.041 --> 01:26:05.600
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

1903
01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:07.310
<v Speaker 3>you know that dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad didn't know shit.</v>

1904
01:26:07.311 --> 01:26:08.270
<v Speaker 3>He didn't even have the Internet.</v>

1905
01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:11.200
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a.</v>

1906
01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:14.680
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not the first to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's such a huge thing with trump.</v>

1907
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:17.280
<v Speaker 2>And he acts like a seven year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1908
01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is a seven year old dude?</v>

1909
01:26:18.930 --> 01:26:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Like you get your Mug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rogan,</v>

1910
01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:22.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking everything</v>

1911
01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:30.340
<v Speaker 2>that so truly puts his fucking name on</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's probably got it on his socks</v>

1912
01:26:30.341 --> 01:26:32.830
<v Speaker 2>and his underwear on the band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably says trump.</v>

1913
01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.920
<v Speaker 2>Trump underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were staying at a trump hotel?</v>

1914
01:26:36.190 --> 01:26:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1915
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:38.320
<v Speaker 2>I know it did in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1916
01:26:38.321 --> 01:26:38.980
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1917
01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:40.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the toilet paper,</v>

1918
01:26:40.241 --> 01:26:42.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm like the little sticker they put on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1919
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:46.750
<v Speaker 2>that's an trump insignia on the toilet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is called the trump hotel.</v>

1920
01:26:46.751 --> 01:26:47.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to the renaissance,</v>

1921
01:26:47.891 --> 01:26:50.920
<v Speaker 2>it says renaissance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's much,</v>

1922
01:26:50.921 --> 01:26:52.450
<v Speaker 2>much more ironic though with the trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1923
01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:56.740
<v Speaker 2>It's weird because it's a guy's name</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's alive and now happens to be</v>

1924
01:26:56.741 --> 01:27:00.970
<v Speaker 2>president and he says it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a symbol of quality around the</v>

1925
01:27:00.971 --> 01:27:03.730
<v Speaker 2>world or whatever the you see that trump</v>
<v Speaker 2>card.</v>

1926
01:27:03.731 --> 01:27:05.800
<v Speaker 2>But I think it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's just a seven year old who</v>

1927
01:27:05.801 --> 01:27:07.450
<v Speaker 2>likes to write his name on my list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

1928
01:27:07.510 --> 01:27:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Well the evidence in his tweets to</v>
<v Speaker 2>people you know,</v>

1929
01:27:11.451 --> 01:27:13.840
<v Speaker 2>and then he gets mad and tweets about</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

1930
01:27:13.870 --> 01:27:16.540
<v Speaker 2>He responds to people and argues with</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1931
01:27:16.541 --> 01:27:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Meet you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tweet at him.</v>

1932
01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:19.210
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1933
01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:21.970
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hardly tweeted anybody.</v>

1934
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:22.833
<v Speaker 2>You don't get it?</v>

1935
01:27:22.890 --> 01:27:23.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

1936
01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:26.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I definitely don't get into like those</v>

1937
01:27:26.891 --> 01:27:31.510
<v Speaker 3>kind of tweet battles over the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just think as I've gotten older</v>

1938
01:27:31.810 --> 01:27:35.380
<v Speaker 3>and had some good experiences and bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences online,</v>

1939
01:27:35.650 --> 01:27:39.790
<v Speaker 3>I've realized that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you were talking about like you go</v>

1940
01:27:39.791 --> 01:27:43.870
<v Speaker 3>out and you seek bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have this in your mind that</v>

1941
01:27:43.871 --> 01:27:45.970
<v Speaker 3>you're going to go out and you're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be attacked.</v>

1942
01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:48.060
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to wear a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have a knife,</v>

1943
01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:49.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to wear a bulletproof vest and</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different things.</v>

1944
01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can also seek negative interaction</v>

1945
01:27:55.660 --> 01:27:57.970
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can go look for it when you find it,</v>

1946
01:27:57.971 --> 01:28:01.480
<v Speaker 3>you could react to it and that begets</v>
<v Speaker 3>more of it and I think that you're far</v>

1947
01:28:01.481 --> 01:28:06.340
<v Speaker 3>better off just choosing the people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you interact with an actual real life.</v>

1948
01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:10.090
<v Speaker 3>And then when I look at things online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just observing.</v>

1949
01:28:10.130 --> 01:28:12.190
<v Speaker 3>I very rarely interact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I do,</v>

1950
01:28:12.191 --> 01:28:16.720
<v Speaker 3>it's a very friendly and I limit myself</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost entirely to friendly</v>

1951
01:28:16.721 --> 01:28:17.730
<v Speaker 3>interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

1952
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:20.170
<v Speaker 3>And anything that's negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just stay away.</v>

1953
01:28:20.290 --> 01:28:22.240
<v Speaker 3>It's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing to be gained.</v>

1954
01:28:22.610 --> 01:28:24.880
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get an insult war with somebody</v>

1955
01:28:24.881 --> 01:28:26.560
<v Speaker 3>and you make them feel bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like do you.</v>

1956
01:28:26.650 --> 01:28:29.560
<v Speaker 3>What do you get out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless it's funny when you get out of</v>

1957
01:28:29.561 --> 01:28:31.030
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless it's tongue and cheek and</v>

1958
01:28:31.031 --> 01:28:31.864
<v Speaker 3>everybody's having a good day.</v>

1959
01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well and and also you know what you can</v>

1960
01:28:35.391 --> 01:28:37.760
<v Speaker 2>do in a hundred and 40 characters is</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely ridiculous.</v>

1961
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:40.430
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't get into a meaningful</v>

1962
01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:44.330
<v Speaker 2>thoughtful debate and 140 characters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people seek it out.</v>

1963
01:28:44.360 --> 01:28:47.330
<v Speaker 2>They seek these debates out and they ask</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like what they think are hard</v>

1964
01:28:47.331 --> 01:28:49.220
<v Speaker 2>hitting questions marked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go Fuck Yourself.</v>

1965
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.150
<v Speaker 2>Get involved in this 140 character</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1966
01:28:53.190 --> 01:28:55.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just the reason why I asked</v>

1967
01:28:55.761 --> 01:28:56.420
<v Speaker 2>because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1968
01:28:56.420 --> 01:28:57.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dunkin starting to kind of tweet it,</v>

1969
01:28:58.130 --> 01:28:59.470
<v Speaker 2>tweet at trump a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>

1970
01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Does he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does he say?</v>

1971
01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Just kind of wacky shit like tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adam,</v>

1972
01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be the minister of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1973
01:29:06.331 --> 01:29:08.390
<v Speaker 2>whatever you got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we got.</v>

1974
01:29:08.460 --> 01:29:10.440
<v Speaker 2>We got to find some of them are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're kind of funny,</v>

1975
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:13.710
<v Speaker 2>but because I think trump sometimes he</v>
<v Speaker 2>does read.</v>

1976
01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:17.050
<v Speaker 2>It's reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweet sort of reads his tweets.</v>

1977
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:18.970
<v Speaker 2>He gets in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you,</v>

1978
01:29:18.971 --> 01:29:21.330
<v Speaker 2>we get to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever see the debate that he had back</v>

1979
01:29:21.331 --> 01:29:23.240
<v Speaker 2>and forth with John Stewart?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

1980
01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:25.530
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's fucking hilarious.</v>

1981
01:29:25.531 --> 01:29:27.450
<v Speaker 2>And Jon Stewart has put it into his act</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1982
01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:34.200
<v Speaker 2>He tweets them at 1:30 in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little Jon Stewart is a pussy and it</v>

1983
01:29:34.201 --> 01:29:38.370
<v Speaker 2>would be hopeless in a debate with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that because actually did that.</v>

1984
01:29:38.371 --> 01:29:39.900
<v Speaker 2>This is the guy that's the president</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

1985
01:29:39.930 --> 01:29:40.770
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so great.</v>

1986
01:29:40.771 --> 01:29:42.270
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean it says so much about the</v>

1987
01:29:42.271 --> 01:29:43.800
<v Speaker 2>personality of someone and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1988
01:29:43.801 --> 01:29:46.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't get in twitter wars because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't really tweet all that much.</v>

1989
01:29:46.561 --> 01:29:48.750
<v Speaker 2>But get facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you use facebook?</v>

1990
01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:51.720
<v Speaker 2>I do and I'm just a horribly impulsive</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

1991
01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Horribly impulsive to a fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of stuff do you get in?</v>

1992
01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:57.090
<v Speaker 2>You were saying you have issues with</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegans.</v>

1993
01:29:57.091 --> 01:29:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Is that when you get into it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1994
01:29:58.550 --> 01:30:00.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some vegan stuff,</v>

1995
01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:03.460
<v Speaker 2>a lot of politics stuff and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the election cycle and,</v>

1996
01:30:03.490 --> 01:30:04.323
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1997
01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little quick on the trigger to like,</v>

1998
01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:10.440
<v Speaker 2>because you know with online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in social media it's just push a button</v>

1999
01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:11.190
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2000
01:30:11.190 --> 01:30:15.660
<v Speaker 2>calling people more on just far too</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly for taking a breath,</v>

2001
01:30:15.661 --> 01:30:17.760
<v Speaker 2>stepping back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I shouldn't call you a moron.</v>

2002
01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.890
<v Speaker 2>That's probably not the best debate</v>
<v Speaker 2>tactic,</v>

2003
01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:21.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit it,</v>

2004
01:30:21.570 --> 01:30:25.110
<v Speaker 2>that benefit if you make them feel bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are more on and you get your</v>

2005
01:30:25.111 --> 01:30:26.880
<v Speaker 2>rocks off in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've done it.</v>

2006
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely have done in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>

2007
01:30:29.251 --> 01:30:32.880
<v Speaker 2>I try very hard not to engage in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of thinking anymore because I don't</v>

2008
01:30:32.881 --> 01:30:35.340
<v Speaker 2>think all it does not going to like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

2009
01:30:35.370 --> 01:30:40.370
<v Speaker 2>when you get into conflicts with people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative conflicts create these uh,</v>

2010
01:30:40.710 --> 01:30:44.700
<v Speaker 2>centers of attention and those conflicts</v>
<v Speaker 2>become these centers of attention and</v>

2011
01:30:44.701 --> 01:30:49.080
<v Speaker 2>ultimately nothing happens in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just sort of distract you.</v>

2012
01:30:49.290 --> 01:30:54.290
<v Speaker 2>A little vortex of bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think and as I've gotten older and</v>

2013
01:30:55.170 --> 01:30:59.760
<v Speaker 2>started analyzing my own life and</v>
<v Speaker 2>happiness and productivity and when I'm</v>

2014
01:30:59.790 --> 01:31:03.510
<v Speaker 2>at my most creative is when I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 2>engaging in any of that,</v>

2015
01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:05.070
<v Speaker 2>like the least.</v>

2016
01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:09.990
<v Speaker 2>I am involved in the negativity and</v>
<v Speaker 2>conflicts and debates and going back and</v>

2017
01:31:09.991 --> 01:31:12.690
<v Speaker 2>forth and trying to make people feel bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that stupid shit that people</v>

2018
01:31:12.691 --> 01:31:15.150
<v Speaker 2>getting wrapped up in you fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2019
01:31:15.151 --> 01:31:17.670
<v Speaker 2>all that kind of stupid stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But more the least.</v>

2020
01:31:17.671 --> 01:31:22.560
<v Speaker 2>I do that the more it frees up my</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources and it frees up my mind and I</v>

2021
01:31:22.561 --> 01:31:25.350
<v Speaker 2>don't have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think anytime you get in conflict</v>

2022
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:29.400
<v Speaker 2>a content conflict with someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it creates like this negative center,</v>

2023
01:31:29.401 --> 01:31:34.401
<v Speaker 2>this like there's this vortex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like weird area in your mind,</v>

2024
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.800
<v Speaker 2>in your consciousness where that</v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict exists.</v>

2025
01:31:37.801 --> 01:31:41.880
<v Speaker 2>It's on a shelf just stinking up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>joint and I think the least amount of</v>

2026
01:31:41.881 --> 01:31:44.670
<v Speaker 2>those that you have in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and your library of,</v>

2027
01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:46.950
<v Speaker 2>of memories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better off you are.</v>

2028
01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:48.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to.</v>

2029
01:31:48.780 --> 01:31:51.330
<v Speaker 2>I tend to agree with that and I tend to</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel that like,</v>

2030
01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:55.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if it's for somebody of my</v>

2031
01:31:55.350 --> 01:31:59.160
<v Speaker 2>cloth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hyper hypocritical to attack</v>

2032
01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:00.310
<v Speaker 2>online,</v>

2033
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:02.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over their political beliefs for sure.</v>

2034
01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:03.191
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2035
01:32:03.191 --> 01:32:08.110
<v Speaker 1>being a spiritual person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not at the same time like</v>

2036
01:32:08.111 --> 01:32:12.280
<v Speaker 1>especially now within the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a highly charged debate cycle</v>

2037
01:32:12.281 --> 01:32:15.520
<v Speaker 1>and I was convinced that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2038
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:17.650
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how possible,</v>

2039
01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:22.680
<v Speaker 1>how could a cognitive Lee kind of adept</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being justify voting for Donald</v>

2040
01:32:24.370 --> 01:32:24.701
<v Speaker 1>Trump?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2041
01:32:24.701 --> 01:32:29.110
<v Speaker 1>it just didn't make sense to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it happened one volv justify voting</v>

2042
01:32:29.111 --> 01:32:30.610
<v Speaker 1>for hillary either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2043
01:32:30.611 --> 01:32:31.900
<v Speaker 1>I can make that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenya.</v>

2044
01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely don't you think that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of issues involved with Hillary</v>

2045
01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:36.873
<v Speaker 1>Clinton?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2046
01:32:36.890 --> 01:32:41.890
<v Speaker 1>Hillary said in the wikileaks documents</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she was against marijuana</v>

2047
01:32:42.731 --> 01:32:45.940
<v Speaker 1>legalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legalization in every sense of the word.</v>

2048
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:46.480
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2049
01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:48.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2050
01:32:48.190 --> 01:32:49.900
<v Speaker 1>Pro Hillary Foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2051
01:32:49.901 --> 01:32:51.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things you could bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2052
01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:54.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a Clinton flag waving kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

2053
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.050
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comparing the two,</v>

2054
01:32:59.290 --> 01:33:00.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2055
01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:02.740
<v Speaker 1>and like however you look like.</v>

2056
01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:05.080
<v Speaker 1>So to me Hillary Clinton was just status</v>
<v Speaker 1>quo,</v>

2057
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:08.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it isn't the status quo fucked up</v>

2058
01:33:08.740 --> 01:33:11.440
<v Speaker 1>and yet really the status quo is better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than negative,</v>

2059
01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:13.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be negative progress.</v>

2060
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:16.660
<v Speaker 1>And how negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how certain are you that it's going to</v>

2061
01:33:16.661 --> 01:33:18.700
<v Speaker 1>be negative progress?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely certain.</v>

2062
01:33:18.701 --> 01:33:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Supreme Court alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2063
01:33:21.281 --> 01:33:24.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ginsburg made the fatal flaw of not</v>

2064
01:33:24.221 --> 01:33:27.880
<v Speaker 1>retiring sooner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean she's 180 years old.</v>

2065
01:33:28.030 --> 01:33:32.140
<v Speaker 1>So there's already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's already one vacancy there.</v>

2066
01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Environments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2067
01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:36.490
<v Speaker 1>she's not gonna make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2068
01:33:36.491 --> 01:33:41.070
<v Speaker 1>so trump in one term could presumably</v>
<v Speaker 1>have three appointees.</v>

2069
01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is negative progress,</v>

2070
01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:45.650
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was a Democrat for almost.</v>

2071
01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:47.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's not now man.</v>

2072
01:33:47.651 --> 01:33:48.281
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2073
01:33:48.281 --> 01:33:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Steve Bannon and the CEO of Exxon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CEO of Carl's Jr.</v>

2074
01:33:53.141 --> 01:33:58.141
<v Speaker 1>I'm a ben carson and being the hud guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean it's,</v>

2075
01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:01.180
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolute insanity.</v>

2076
01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't he make Ben Carson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carson,</v>

2077
01:34:03.610 --> 01:34:05.650
<v Speaker 1>the attorney general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or rather the,</v>

2078
01:34:05.651 --> 01:34:07.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surgeon general surgeon general.</v>

2079
01:34:07.390 --> 01:34:08.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't he have been involved in</v>

2080
01:34:08.831 --> 01:34:09.700
<v Speaker 1>something medical?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2081
01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:12.370
<v Speaker 1>he's very talented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neurospheres jesse was tHe african</v>

2082
01:34:12.371 --> 01:34:14.560
<v Speaker 1>american guy who grew up in the projects</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2083
01:34:14.561 --> 01:34:16.550
<v Speaker 1>So he should run hud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2084
01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:17.920
<v Speaker 1>how odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the argument.</v>

2085
01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2086
01:34:19.450 --> 01:34:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

2087
01:34:20.381 --> 01:34:22.240
<v Speaker 1>it seems like he knows more aBout</v>
<v Speaker 1>medIcine,</v>

2088
01:34:22.241 --> 01:34:27.241
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a doctor take you to fucking medical</v>

2089
01:34:27.581 --> 01:34:29.740
<v Speaker 1>expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's actually good at that.</v>

2090
01:34:29.741 --> 01:34:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking amazing at it.</v>

2091
01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:33.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like one of the top neurosurgeons</v>

2092
01:34:33.371 --> 01:34:34.220
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2093
01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:37.390
<v Speaker 1>So he grew up from the projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>African american guy grew up out of</v>

2094
01:34:37.391 --> 01:34:38.920
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he must know about the housing and</v>

2095
01:34:38.921 --> 01:34:42.610
<v Speaker 1>urban development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just complete insanity to me.</v>

2096
01:34:42.630 --> 01:34:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Ended is taking two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three steps backwards,</v>

2097
01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:50.530
<v Speaker 1>the only silver lining that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>weave from it and it is,</v>

2098
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:53.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing to weave is that there</v>

2099
01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 1>is kind of a collective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a consolidation</v>

2100
01:34:58.190 --> 01:34:59.810
<v Speaker 3>of solidarity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of like,</v>

2101
01:34:59.811 --> 01:35:00.400
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2102
01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:02.210
<v Speaker 3>we need to rise up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get our shit together,</v>

2103
01:35:02.211 --> 01:35:06.260
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to articulate the</v>
<v Speaker 3>opposite vision and perhaps defeat this</v>

2104
01:35:06.261 --> 01:35:08.210
<v Speaker 3>later on down the line.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's cool.</v>

2105
01:35:08.211 --> 01:35:11.000
<v Speaker 3>People are waking up and there's great</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations happening.</v>

2106
01:35:11.090 --> 01:35:14.390
<v Speaker 3>Well I think there's an ebb and flow</v>
<v Speaker 3>that always exists in cultures.</v>

2107
01:35:14.391 --> 01:35:16.130
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a push left and a push,</v>

2108
01:35:16.131 --> 01:35:18.380
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we try this for eight years and then</v>

2109
01:35:18.381 --> 01:35:21.470
<v Speaker 3>we'd go that way for eight years and</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of it's productive and some of it's</v>

2110
01:35:21.471 --> 01:35:24.110
<v Speaker 3>very negative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even the negative,</v>

2111
01:35:24.170 --> 01:35:25.870
<v Speaker 3>ultimately it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2112
01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:30.380
<v Speaker 3>it fosters resistance and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>resistance is often times positive.</v>

2113
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:34.250
<v Speaker 3>And in even in resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of understanding of the</v>

2114
01:35:34.251 --> 01:35:38.170
<v Speaker 3>consequences of negativity that may be</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't really appreciate it.</v>

2115
01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:42.290
<v Speaker 3>And while you had like a progressive</v>
<v Speaker 3>democrat in office,</v>

2116
01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:43.371
<v Speaker 3>but then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2117
01:35:43.371 --> 01:35:47.060
<v Speaker 3>there's things that obama did that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are incredibly upset with in</v>

2118
01:35:47.061 --> 01:35:49.280
<v Speaker 3>terms of whistle blowing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2119
01:35:49.290 --> 01:35:53.930
<v Speaker 3>like whistleblowers were supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>cherished and he was going to help him.</v>

2120
01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:56.750
<v Speaker 3>That was all part of the hope and change</v>
<v Speaker 3>website when he was running for</v>

2121
01:35:56.751 --> 01:35:59.360
<v Speaker 3>president as was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then of course he's been one of the</v>

2122
01:35:59.361 --> 01:36:03.950
<v Speaker 3>worst people in terms of freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 3>press in terms of whistleblowers been in</v>

2123
01:36:03.951 --> 01:36:07.460
<v Speaker 3>one of the worst administrations ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guantanamo never closed drones.</v>

2124
01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:09.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drones and drone wars.</v>

2125
01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:11.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All this stuff because there's</v>

2126
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:12.390
<v Speaker 3>absolutely no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some,</v>

2127
01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:14.020
<v Speaker 3>there's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2128
01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:15.800
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with sort of,</v>

2129
01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:18.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ebbs and flows of progress versus no</v>

2130
01:36:18.321 --> 01:36:19.280
<v Speaker 3>progress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2131
01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:21.830
<v Speaker 3>And in this instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this context,</v>

2132
01:36:21.831 --> 01:36:25.490
<v Speaker 3>it's just how many people are going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get hurt as a result of it.</v>

2133
01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:28.880
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I don't mind.</v>

2134
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:32.180
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's not the lack of</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective that I think we have</v>

2135
01:36:32.181 --> 01:36:34.220
<v Speaker 3>collectively as a culture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lack of.</v>

2136
01:36:34.221 --> 01:36:38.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean what you were talking about about</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people living their lives solely</v>

2137
01:36:38.151 --> 01:36:43.151
<v Speaker 3>intent on acquiring material possessions</v>
<v Speaker 3>and status and all the nonsense that</v>

2138
01:36:44.121 --> 01:36:44.954
<v Speaker 3>goes with it.</v>

2139
01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:50.380
<v Speaker 3>How much of that can be attributed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the relative lack of exposure to</v>

2140
01:36:51.111 --> 01:36:54.590
<v Speaker 3>psychedelics collectively that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you looked at,</v>

2141
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:58.970
<v Speaker 3>if you looked at the entire 300 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you knoW how they do that red map</v>

2142
01:36:58.971 --> 01:37:01.070
<v Speaker 3>and you see how many people are</v>
<v Speaker 3>republicans and how many people are</v>

2143
01:37:01.071 --> 01:37:03.890
<v Speaker 3>democrats and it looks like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like the whole country,</v>

2144
01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:07.520
<v Speaker 3>one of the avatar people get hit by a</v>
<v Speaker 3>train and that's what it looks like.</v>

2145
01:37:07.521 --> 01:37:09.080
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got splattered.</v>

2146
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:12.140
<v Speaker 3>But when you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at that,</v>

2147
01:37:12.141 --> 01:37:16.640
<v Speaker 3>if you had a similar map in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how many people have had what I</v>

2148
01:37:16.641 --> 01:37:19.070
<v Speaker 3>would consider a Breakthrough</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experienCe.</v>

2149
01:37:19.071 --> 01:37:21.620
<v Speaker 3>I know some people that have done</v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms and they did a little bit and</v>

2150
01:37:21.621 --> 01:37:26.621
<v Speaker 3>they felt good and no big deal and I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had done quite a few things before my</v>

2151
01:37:26.751 --> 01:37:31.460
<v Speaker 3>first real dmt trip and the first real</v>
<v Speaker 3>real dmt trip was like,</v>

2152
01:37:31.461 --> 01:37:34.430
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything else is bullshit.</v>

2153
01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.330
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is awesome,</v>

2154
01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:39.950
<v Speaker 3>this is so awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so mind blowing and just knowing</v>

2155
01:37:39.951 --> 01:37:43.490
<v Speaker 3>that that's a real plaCe that anyone can</v>
<v Speaker 3>get to.</v>

2156
01:37:43.810 --> 01:37:45.500
<v Speaker 3>relatively easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

2157
01:37:46.490 --> 01:37:49.430
<v Speaker 3>this is not a precious material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a material that exists in</v>

2158
01:37:49.431 --> 01:37:51.620
<v Speaker 3>thousands of different plants all over</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2159
01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:54.920
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like every drive down the street,</v>

2160
01:37:54.921 --> 01:37:58.120
<v Speaker 3>you'll a fucking hundred different kinds</v>
<v Speaker 3>of plants that have dnt in around.</v>

2161
01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:03.560
<v Speaker 3>So the dmt experience to me was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say like I was really like two</v>

2162
01:38:05.461 --> 01:38:09.060
<v Speaker 3>different people on the pre dmt person</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the post emt person.</v>

2163
01:38:09.061 --> 01:38:10.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean a real similar.</v>

2164
01:38:11.310 --> 01:38:14.520
<v Speaker 3>I talked to the same but the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the person,</v>

2165
01:38:14.730 --> 01:38:18.660
<v Speaker 3>the experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so vastly different that I was</v>

2166
01:38:18.661 --> 01:38:23.661
<v Speaker 3>exposed to a whole new infinity area of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the spectrum that I didn't know existed</v>

2167
01:38:25.471 --> 01:38:28.530
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assisted in this very small area.</v>

2168
01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:33.200
<v Speaker 3>I thought there was like birth and death</v>
<v Speaker 3>and love and sex and beer and you know,</v>

2169
01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:35.730
<v Speaker 3>fucking movies and what all the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>things he enjoyed.</v>

2170
01:38:35.770 --> 01:38:37.380
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know that was real.</v>

2171
01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:39.750
<v Speaker 3>How many people out there like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2172
01:38:39.751 --> 01:38:41.700
<v Speaker 3>is there a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a million of us,</v>

2173
01:38:41.970 --> 01:38:42.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there even,</v>

2174
01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:45.300
<v Speaker 3>is there even 2 million?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2175
01:38:45.301 --> 01:38:48.990
<v Speaker 3>how many people out of the 300 and</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever million people in this country</v>

2176
01:38:48.991 --> 01:38:51.110
<v Speaker 3>have had breakthrough psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiences?</v>

2177
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:53.430
<v Speaker 1>How many people did they say did lsd in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sixties?</v>

2178
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:55.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That changed the culture.</v>

2179
01:38:56.420 --> 01:38:58.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the number is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

2180
01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:01.130
<v Speaker 1>you had your dad's on around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably tell us.</v>

2181
01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably responsible for 40 or 50</v>

2182
01:39:03.361 --> 01:39:04.141
<v Speaker 1>percent of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2183
01:39:04.141 --> 01:39:05.520
<v Speaker 1>What was the number?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

2184
01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

2185
01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:08.640
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a fascinating case study for us</v>

2186
01:39:08.641 --> 01:39:10.800
<v Speaker 1>to look at is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2187
01:39:10.801 --> 01:39:12.510
<v Speaker 1>in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2188
01:39:12.511 --> 01:39:16.020
<v Speaker 1>millions and millions and millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people did some kind of psychedelic,</v>

2189
01:39:16.021 --> 01:39:16.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2190
01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:18.200
<v Speaker 1>And if they didn't do a second alec,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least they,</v>

2191
01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:21.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoked grass and put on sergeant peppers</v>

2192
01:39:21.750 --> 01:39:25.020
<v Speaker 1>at the very least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yay,</v>

2193
01:39:25.021 --> 01:39:26.730
<v Speaker 1>great thIngs were born out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2194
01:39:26.731 --> 01:39:30.540
<v Speaker 1>an argument could be made that if the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties didn't happen and flourish and</v>

2195
01:39:30.570 --> 01:39:33.820
<v Speaker 1>become what it became that you and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be some here right now and</v>

2196
01:39:33.821 --> 01:39:36.420
<v Speaker 1>being able to talk about what we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>

2197
01:39:36.590 --> 01:39:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a very good argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2198
01:39:38.331 --> 01:39:39.164
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2199
01:39:39.210 --> 01:39:42.960
<v Speaker 1>but here we are 2016 and Donald Trump is</v>
<v Speaker 1>elected president.</v>

2200
01:39:42.961 --> 01:39:47.961
<v Speaker 1>So last time we had a global kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness shift that was massive and</v>

2201
01:39:48.570 --> 01:39:51.240
<v Speaker 1>really shook us all up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2202
01:39:51.241 --> 01:39:52.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not enough happened.</v>

2203
01:39:53.370 --> 01:39:55.320
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it going to take next time?</v>

2204
01:39:55.321 --> 01:39:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

2205
01:39:56.580 --> 01:40:00.060
<v Speaker 1>let's get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just say let's get 10 percent of</v>

2206
01:40:00.061 --> 01:40:02.430
<v Speaker 1>the country to turn on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me I kind of,</v>

2207
01:40:02.431 --> 01:40:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little bit more elastic with it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that can also be,</v>

2208
01:40:06.210 --> 01:40:07.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditation.</v>

2209
01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:08.391
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>

2210
01:40:08.391 --> 01:40:11.210
<v Speaker 1>or flickr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flotation tanks.</v>

2211
01:40:11.290 --> 01:40:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Not so holotropic breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2212
01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:16.620
<v Speaker 1>The method isn't as important to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

2213
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:20.250
<v Speaker 1>but like say get 10 to 20 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to do that.</v>

2214
01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:21.001
<v Speaker 1>Six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2215
01:40:21.001 --> 01:40:22.470
<v Speaker 1>6 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

2216
01:40:22.471 --> 01:40:24.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

2217
01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:25.920
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it going to change?</v>

2218
01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:27.250
<v Speaker 1>How are we going to integrate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'd,</v>

2219
01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:28.830
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about this a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours ago,</v>

2220
01:40:28.831 --> 01:40:32.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like the integration part and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think perhaps that's what we lost in the</v>

2221
01:40:32.881 --> 01:40:36.270
<v Speaker 1>sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were so hung up on the veil getting</v>

2222
01:40:36.271 --> 01:40:40.020
<v Speaker 1>pierced and in my dad's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best quotes is um,</v>

2223
01:40:40.110 --> 01:40:42.870
<v Speaker 1>in order to understand the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must understand the fifties,</v>

2224
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:45.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a change in the fifties were just,</v>

2225
01:40:46.110 --> 01:40:49.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very lock and step and white picket</v>

2226
01:40:49.081 --> 01:40:50.610
<v Speaker 1>fence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two point five children,</v>

2227
01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:51.571
<v Speaker 1>cart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2228
01:40:51.571 --> 01:40:53.040
<v Speaker 1>suit and tie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair short.</v>

2229
01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Like there was no variation.</v>

2230
01:40:54.970 --> 01:40:59.260
<v Speaker 3>And we burst that bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But even at the integration level,</v>

2231
01:40:59.261 --> 01:41:01.840
<v Speaker 3>it just wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't media enough,</v>

2232
01:41:02.140 --> 01:41:03.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we still,</v>

2233
01:41:03.251 --> 01:41:06.100
<v Speaker 3>we elected Richard Nixon in 1968.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2234
01:41:06.101 --> 01:41:08.410
<v Speaker 3>granted Robert Kennedy was shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but still,</v>

2235
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:11.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here we are 50 years later and look</v>

2236
01:41:11.801 --> 01:41:12.880
<v Speaker 3>what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2237
01:41:13.690 --> 01:41:16.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is great to turn on and I liked</v>

2238
01:41:16.001 --> 01:41:18.940
<v Speaker 3>people turning on and I think it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>fantastic and it's a great thing to talk</v>

2239
01:41:18.941 --> 01:41:20.320
<v Speaker 3>about like you are in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2240
01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:22.810
<v Speaker 3>you have a huge megaphone and getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to do that.</v>

2241
01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:26.410
<v Speaker 3>But what are they going to do different?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm more concerned with.</v>

2242
01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:28.750
<v Speaker 3>They're going to consider their life in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a different way.</v>

2243
01:41:29.180 --> 01:41:32.510
<v Speaker 3>And I think that yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that in many people maybe,</v>

2244
01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:35.800
<v Speaker 3>maybe not at all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in many people that changes the</v>

2245
01:41:35.801 --> 01:41:40.600
<v Speaker 3>direction of the path that you're on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It changes the way you communicate with</v>

2246
01:41:40.601 --> 01:41:43.840
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>changes your understanding of each other</v>

2247
01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:47.050
<v Speaker 3>in your understanding of the connections</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have with each other.</v>

2248
01:41:47.080 --> 01:41:48.520
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2249
01:41:48.710 --> 01:41:53.710
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a giant chunk of people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are what you would call a</v>

2250
01:41:54.460 --> 01:41:59.460
<v Speaker 3>influencers in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's politicians or ceos of</v>

2251
01:42:00.971 --> 01:42:03.340
<v Speaker 3>large corporations casters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2252
01:42:03.341 --> 01:42:04.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to say people that</v>

2253
01:42:04.631 --> 01:42:06.870
<v Speaker 3>haven't had this experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

2254
01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:11.020
<v Speaker 3>these influencers that live in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very flat plane of existence,</v>

2255
01:42:11.021 --> 01:42:13.690
<v Speaker 3>of acquiring material possessions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting your dick sucked,</v>

2256
01:42:13.691 --> 01:42:15.510
<v Speaker 3>doing a line of coke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>driving in your limo,</v>

2257
01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:19.020
<v Speaker 3>all the different shit that a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like look forward to that like</v>

2258
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:23.260
<v Speaker 3>ultimately might not really be important</v>
<v Speaker 3>or important.</v>

2259
01:42:23.261 --> 01:42:25.690
<v Speaker 3>It might feel importaNt in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2260
01:42:25.691 --> 01:42:28.060
<v Speaker 3>and this ego gratification sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

2261
01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:33.540
<v Speaker 3>but without that ego obliterating</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience to put it all into</v>

2262
01:42:33.731 --> 01:42:36.490
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might not understand that that state</v>

2263
01:42:36.491 --> 01:42:40.810
<v Speaker 3>of mind is even achievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the undeniable ego shattering</v>

2264
01:42:40.811 --> 01:42:45.590
<v Speaker 3>experience of like a severe mushroom</v>
<v Speaker 3>trip or a dmt trip or you know,</v>

2265
01:42:45.591 --> 01:42:46.900
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything along those lines.</v>

2266
01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:52.270
<v Speaker 3>It's so beneficial in that it gives you</v>
<v Speaker 3>that momentary break from the ego and</v>

2267
01:42:52.271 --> 01:42:56.200
<v Speaker 3>from this mo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the momentum of the race that you might</v>

2268
01:42:56.201 --> 01:42:58.150
<v Speaker 3>not really want to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2269
01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:02.020
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that are doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>things they fucking hate all day long</v>

2270
01:43:02.050 --> 01:43:04.390
<v Speaker 3>Just in order to acquire shit that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't really need.</v>

2271
01:43:04.430 --> 01:43:05.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I was like,</v>

2272
01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:09.670
<v Speaker 3>the point I was trying to make earlier</v>
<v Speaker 3>is like this hand that you're deAlt is</v>

2273
01:43:09.671 --> 01:43:14.590
<v Speaker 3>bunk because you're like so many people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are trapped in that thing of like doing</v>

2274
01:43:14.591 --> 01:43:15.890
<v Speaker 3>something they hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2275
01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:17.770
<v Speaker 3>But do they have to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds like</v>

2276
01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:21.850
<v Speaker 3>they think they have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

2277
01:43:21.851 --> 01:43:24.100
<v Speaker 3>They think they have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no they don't.</v>

2278
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:26.020
<v Speaker 3>They can breAk free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can pierce the veil.</v>

2279
01:43:26.021 --> 01:43:30.250
<v Speaker 3>They can go into a dmt trip or gotten a</v>
<v Speaker 3>flotation take and break free and then</v>

2280
01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:36.810
<v Speaker 3>even just by quitting some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty job and doing something you love</v>

2281
01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:38.740
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't more people do that because</v>

2282
01:43:38.741 --> 01:43:41.830
<v Speaker 3>they're scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what is 100 percent?</v>

2283
01:43:41.831 --> 01:43:43.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are afraid of change.</v>

2284
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:45.940
<v Speaker 3>They're afraid of the unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're afraid of uncertainty.</v>

2285
01:43:45.941 --> 01:43:49.210
<v Speaker 3>They're afraid of failure for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you offer them some really</v>

2286
01:43:49.211 --> 01:43:52.370
<v Speaker 3>convenient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid job that is absolutely</v>

2287
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:54.800
<v Speaker 2>going to stay there for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or hey man,</v>

2288
01:43:54.801 --> 01:43:58.280
<v Speaker 2>take a chance to open a pottery studio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go broke.</v>

2289
01:43:58.550 --> 01:44:00.170
<v Speaker 2>People are terrified of failure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2290
01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:02.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also think there's a level of it</v>

2291
01:44:02.901 --> 01:44:06.650
<v Speaker 2>that's also kind of like graduate school</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sense that maybe a lot of people</v>

2292
01:44:06.651 --> 01:44:09.540
<v Speaker 2>are just addicted to being pacified that</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2293
01:44:09.810 --> 01:44:12.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get my three hours of television that</v>

2294
01:44:12.261 --> 01:44:13.740
<v Speaker 2>night and I get my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2295
01:44:13.741 --> 01:44:18.230
<v Speaker 2>and they're even considering that notion</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what you're talking about beyond the</v>

2296
01:44:18.231 --> 01:44:19.220
<v Speaker 2>realm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2297
01:44:19.221 --> 01:44:20.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that experience keep me plugged in.</v>

2298
01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:21.561
<v Speaker 2>I'm cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2299
01:44:21.561 --> 01:44:23.450
<v Speaker 2>that expreSsion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comfort zone is beautiful,</v>

2300
01:44:23.451 --> 01:44:25.340
<v Speaker 2>but nothing grows there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2301
01:44:26.110 --> 01:44:26.840
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2302
01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:27.850
<v Speaker 2>it's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2303
01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:29.630
<v Speaker 2>it's nice to be comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful,</v>

2304
01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:32.450
<v Speaker 2>relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't get better at anything.</v>

2305
01:44:32.451 --> 01:44:34.670
<v Speaker 2>You don't get better at life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't grow.</v>

2306
01:44:34.670 --> 01:44:38.420
<v Speaker 2>And we're scared of uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we want to survive.</v>

2307
01:44:38.421 --> 01:44:40.760
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to starve to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to be a failure.</v>

2308
01:44:40.970 --> 01:44:44.810
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to be that guy that used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be on tv and now he's a security</v>

2309
01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:45.640
<v Speaker 2>guard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2310
01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:49.880
<v Speaker 2>Then all those things that like the fear</v>
<v Speaker 2>of not being successful,</v>

2311
01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:52.300
<v Speaker 2>so stifling it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>GOt it.</v>

2312
01:44:52.350 --> 01:44:53.270
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2313
01:44:53.540 --> 01:44:55.910
<v Speaker 2>When you say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who just immediately just triggered my,</v>

2314
01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:58.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my own life and all the failures.</v>

2315
01:44:58.071 --> 01:45:00.950
<v Speaker 2>I've had all the fuck ups falling flat</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my face,</v>

2316
01:45:00.951 --> 01:45:01.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

2317
01:45:01.581 --> 01:45:02.540
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times.</v>

2318
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:07.130
<v Speaker 2>BuT like getting back up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's where the work is,</v>

2319
01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:09.380
<v Speaker 2>that's where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where the awakening is.</v>

2320
01:45:09.381 --> 01:45:10.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't like,</v>

2321
01:45:10.311 --> 01:45:13.190
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is going perfectly and oh</v>

2322
01:45:13.191 --> 01:45:15.910
<v Speaker 2>well isn't this all my life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And since rolling out on a red carpet</v>

2323
01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:20.920
<v Speaker 2>and then I turned on or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and I touched the face of</v>

2324
01:45:21.351 --> 01:45:21.950
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment.</v>

2325
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:24.020
<v Speaker 2>NO,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because I fell in the dirt and you</v>

2326
01:45:24.021 --> 01:45:27.390
<v Speaker 2>take those risks and shit happens and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you and you,</v>

2327
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:29.720
<v Speaker 2>the grist for the mill is wronged us</v>
<v Speaker 2>would say.</v>

2328
01:45:29.721 --> 01:45:32.090
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have that grist for the mill that</v>

2329
01:45:32.091 --> 01:45:34.970
<v Speaker 2>makes it so much jucier and falling</v>
<v Speaker 2>funding your face.</v>

2330
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.360
<v Speaker 2>It's essential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think essential You can apply that</v>

2331
01:45:38.361 --> 01:45:43.220
<v Speaker 2>same sort of thinking to our entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>

2332
01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:46.700
<v Speaker 2>And I think right now we might've</v>
<v Speaker 2>skinned our knees.</v>

2333
01:45:46.970 --> 01:45:49.850
<v Speaker 2>We might've fallen on our face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might've gone facedown in the mud.</v>

2334
01:45:49.851 --> 01:45:50.930
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>

2335
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:53.840
<v Speaker 2>And I think you've got to get up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that we fucked it up.</v>

2336
01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:56.210
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll see how bad we fucked it up.</v>

2337
01:45:56.211 --> 01:45:58.520
<v Speaker 2>And who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because one of the things about having</v>

2338
01:45:58.521 --> 01:46:02.630
<v Speaker 2>an outsider in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think is an impossibly corrupt</v>

2339
01:46:03.230 --> 01:46:07.550
<v Speaker 2>unfixable foundation filled with</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit,</v>

2340
01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:09.950
<v Speaker 2>which is what I think our society is</v>
<v Speaker 2>built on.</v>

2341
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's special interest groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporate greed or lobbyists or all the</v>

2342
01:46:14.181 --> 01:46:16.040
<v Speaker 2>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>private prisons.</v>

2343
01:46:16.041 --> 01:46:20.930
<v Speaker 2>And fucking the war on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the chaos that I think any rational</v>

2344
01:46:20.931 --> 01:46:24.020
<v Speaker 2>person that's not connected to it in any</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a way where you're making profit</v>

2345
01:46:24.021 --> 01:46:28.790
<v Speaker 2>off of would agree like this is an</v>
<v Speaker 2>insane way for an enlightened society to</v>

2346
01:46:28.791 --> 01:46:30.260
<v Speaker 2>behave and act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's broken,</v>

2347
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:31.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfixable.</v>

2348
01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:34.220
<v Speaker 2>Just just bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2349
01:46:34.970 --> 01:46:39.970
<v Speaker 2>That the awareness of that is more and</v>
<v Speaker 2>more exposed today online and in</v>

2350
01:46:44.121 --> 01:46:48.470
<v Speaker 2>conversations and people are more aware</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that than any other time in human</v>

2351
01:46:48.471 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I feel like we're like</v>

2352
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:54.120
<v Speaker 1>a giant battleship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it takes a lot to turn that fucker.</v>

2353
01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:58.080
<v Speaker 1>It takes on a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of thinking and action.</v>

2354
01:46:58.090 --> 01:47:01.110
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time for that thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually spin around.</v>

2355
01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

2356
01:47:02.281 --> 01:47:03.330
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first,</v>

2357
01:47:03.370 --> 01:47:05.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first step in that is like the</v>

2358
01:47:05.281 --> 01:47:08.670
<v Speaker 1>acknowledgement that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we skinned our knees or maybe fell flat</v>

2359
01:47:08.730 --> 01:47:12.660
<v Speaker 1>face down into the mode or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is the acknowledgement that that is</v>

2360
01:47:12.661 --> 01:47:14.430
<v Speaker 1>the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the scenario we're in.</v>

2361
01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:18.630
<v Speaker 1>And which is why I'm always so</v>
<v Speaker 1>frustrated in that like,</v>

2362
01:47:18.631 --> 01:47:20.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the general narrative or the general</v>

2363
01:47:20.671 --> 01:47:23.370
<v Speaker 1>rhetoric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in politics is,</v>

2364
01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:25.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong conversations always being</v>

2365
01:47:25.651 --> 01:47:27.870
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's talking about the right shit.</v>

2366
01:47:27.871 --> 01:47:30.270
<v Speaker 1>We're treating the symptom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never treat the disease.</v>

2367
01:47:30.271 --> 01:47:32.120
<v Speaker 1>We're just treating the flu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2368
01:47:32.130 --> 01:47:36.780
<v Speaker 1>blowing her notes constantly and never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever acknowledging the disease.</v>

2369
01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:37.973
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bernie,</v>

2370
01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:40.740
<v Speaker 1>bernie sanders touched on acknowledging</v>
<v Speaker 1>the disease.</v>

2371
01:47:40.741 --> 01:47:44.520
<v Speaker 1>He was the first guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>WhAt really in a long time to make it</v>

2372
01:47:44.521 --> 01:47:49.521
<v Speaker 1>that far and acknowledged the disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are at risk of becoming an oligarchy.</v>

2373
01:47:49.681 --> 01:47:52.410
<v Speaker 1>It's the top one percent that is ruling</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

2374
01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:53.910
<v Speaker 1>He may be the first guy ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2375
01:47:53.911 --> 01:47:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you really stop and think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

2376
01:47:55.501 --> 01:47:58.320
<v Speaker 1>like who got that close to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic nomination,</v>

2377
01:47:58.500 --> 01:47:59.740
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2378
01:47:59.741 --> 01:48:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Other than mcgovern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2379
01:48:01.231 --> 01:48:03.690
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in know older,</v>

2380
01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:05.010
<v Speaker 1>older times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2381
01:48:05.130 --> 01:48:07.270
<v Speaker 1>in the 19th century there was kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2382
01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:12.460
<v Speaker 1>hints that this could happen and kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in senior waiting a,</v>

2383
01:48:12.461 --> 01:48:14.460
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the industrial revolution and carnegies</v>

2384
01:48:14.461 --> 01:48:15.960
<v Speaker 1>and the mellons and the rockefellers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2385
01:48:15.961 --> 01:48:19.630
<v Speaker 1>watch out that this could get dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2386
01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:22.110
<v Speaker 1>eisenhower warned of the military</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial complex.</v>

2387
01:48:22.111 --> 01:48:23.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a republican.</v>

2388
01:48:23.250 --> 01:48:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was a creepy speech,</v>

2389
01:48:25.111 --> 01:48:27.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're creepy speech but fascinating at</v>

2390
01:48:27.661 --> 01:48:28.590
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeAh.</v>

2391
01:48:28.591 --> 01:48:29.760
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But bernie took it.</v>

2392
01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:34.770
<v Speaker 1>He did talk about the disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was fantastic.</v>

2393
01:48:34.771 --> 01:48:38.910
<v Speaker 1>So it is out there that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have these fundamental problems</v>

2394
01:48:38.911 --> 01:48:42.330
<v Speaker 1>until you fix the fundamental problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing else is going to get better,</v>

2395
01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:44.970
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially taking the money</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the game.</v>

2396
01:48:45.290 --> 01:48:46.123
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2397
01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I do think it's fixable.</v>

2398
01:48:48.181 --> 01:48:51.000
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with you in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I do think the machine is,</v>

2399
01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:52.770
<v Speaker 1>it's fixable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How it fixable.</v>

2400
01:48:52.900 --> 01:48:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Take the money out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's unfixable.</v>

2401
01:48:55.410 --> 01:48:56.880
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole thing runs on money.</v>

2402
01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:58.440
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to take the money out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you read?</v>

2408
01:49:07.170 --> 01:49:08.003
<v Speaker 1>the solution.</v>

2409
01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of lobbyists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2410
01:49:10.411 --> 01:49:11.820
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's easier said than done.</v>

2411
01:49:11.821 --> 01:49:12.650
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2412
01:49:12.650 --> 01:49:14.730
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of my trump is actually working to</v>

2413
01:49:14.731 --> 01:49:16.680
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas someone like hillary is not</v>

2414
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:18.480
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's already put in a bunch of</v>

2415
01:49:18.481 --> 01:49:21.360
<v Speaker 1>regulations to make sure that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot become lobbyists,</v>

2416
01:49:21.361 --> 01:49:24.060
<v Speaker 1>but at a certain amount of time after</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving off after leaving office.</v>

2417
01:49:24.061 --> 01:49:29.061
<v Speaker 1>But he also has like the prisoner elect</v>
<v Speaker 1>office is crawling at the same time.</v>

2418
01:49:29.251 --> 01:49:30.750
<v Speaker 1>It's crawling with lobbyists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2419
01:49:30.751 --> 01:49:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2420
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a trump supporter,</v>

2421
01:49:33.061 --> 01:49:33.894
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2422
01:49:34.150 --> 01:49:35.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

2423
01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:40.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not convinced that having this</v>
<v Speaker 1>complete outsider who's also a guy who's</v>

2424
01:49:40.780 --> 01:49:44.640
<v Speaker 1>been feeding this machine with money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>making these massive political</v>

2425
01:49:44.641 --> 01:49:47.560
<v Speaker 1>contributions so he understands the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system and how works.</v>

2426
01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:48.733
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

2427
01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:52.840
<v Speaker 2>not completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not completely denying the</v>

2428
01:49:52.841 --> 01:49:54.610
<v Speaker 2>possibility that he might present some</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

2429
01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:56.950
<v Speaker 2>I just think he's the wrong guy for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

2430
01:49:56.951 --> 01:49:59.380
<v Speaker 2>I do believe in the outsider thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

2431
01:49:59.381 --> 01:50:00.680
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great part of him.</v>

2432
01:50:00.690 --> 01:50:02.840
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bernie would have been fascinating.</v>

2433
01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Bernie would have been fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Costs me a shitload of money,</v>

2434
01:50:05.261 --> 01:50:06.710
<v Speaker 2>but I would have been willing to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>that chance.</v>

2435
01:50:07.570 --> 01:50:10.210
<v Speaker 2>I would loved to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love to see what the fuck would happen</v>

2436
01:50:10.211 --> 01:50:13.270
<v Speaker 2>because that guy doesn't give a shit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not.</v>

2437
01:50:13.271 --> 01:50:14.560
<v Speaker 2>You can't buy him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2438
01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:16.970
<v Speaker 2>He can't buy him in and you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch this,</v>

2439
01:50:16.971 --> 01:50:19.030
<v Speaker 2>this lawrence lessig tuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a few years old now,</v>

2440
01:50:19.031 --> 01:50:22.840
<v Speaker 2>but it really just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of rips apart and puts</v>

2441
01:50:22.841 --> 01:50:24.840
<v Speaker 2>everything out on the whiteboard and</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a,</v>

2442
01:50:24.841 --> 01:50:27.520
<v Speaker 2>like a keynote presentation about even</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2443
01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:30.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most well intentioned to politicians</v>

2444
01:50:30.371 --> 01:50:31.180
<v Speaker 2>who are great.</v>

2445
01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Mr. Smith goes to Washington kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2446
01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Just great people who go in there with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best of intentions,</v>

2447
01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:38.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some point,</v>

2448
01:50:38.141 --> 01:50:40.720
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they end up spending 25 percent of</v>

2449
01:50:40.721 --> 01:50:43.120
<v Speaker 2>their time inside of the phone bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the democratic,</v>

2450
01:50:43.121 --> 01:50:46.660
<v Speaker 2>the dnc phone bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>begging people for money and I know they</v>

2451
01:50:46.661 --> 01:50:51.130
<v Speaker 2>do that and it's across the street from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the capital so it's not too far and it</v>

2452
01:50:51.131 --> 01:50:53.200
<v Speaker 2>just ended escalates and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>snowball.</v>

2453
01:50:53.201 --> 01:50:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Just go more and more and then it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes even the best intent.</v>

2454
01:50:56.860 --> 01:51:01.720
<v Speaker 2>It just out of politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you have only people with money who</v>

2455
01:51:01.750 --> 01:51:03.910
<v Speaker 2>get into politics because they have so</v>
<v Speaker 2>much money.</v>

2456
01:51:03.911 --> 01:51:06.880
<v Speaker 2>They don't need anybody else's money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hence Donald Trump.</v>

2457
01:51:07.050 --> 01:51:09.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean if you did it like a,</v>

2458
01:51:09.581 --> 01:51:11.440

2459
01:51:11.530 --> 01:51:14.620
<v Speaker 2>if you did it like the uk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it shortened the election season.</v>

2460
01:51:14.860 --> 01:51:15.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first we got,</v>

2461
01:51:15.730 --> 01:51:17.610

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2462
01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:19.870
<v Speaker 2>you can't make it 18 months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

<v Speaker 2>And the amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>team sport,</v>

2487
01:52:19.691 --> 01:52:20.640
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are the rent our education rankings,</v>

2489
01:52:24.190 --> 01:52:26.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of in the world in a world</v>

2490
01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:28.060
<v Speaker 2>where we're used to place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2491
01:52:28.130 --> 01:52:30.910
<v Speaker 2>the typical high school graduate</v>
<v Speaker 2>graduate in the year,</v>

2492
01:52:30.911 --> 01:52:32.860
<v Speaker 2>like 1960,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2493
01:52:32.890 --> 01:52:37.210
<v Speaker 2>it's like going to college and brent and</v>
<v Speaker 2>ranked number one in global math,</v>

2494
01:52:37.211 --> 01:52:38.170
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2495
01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:41.980
<v Speaker 2>that's because the rest of the world was</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the stone age and we were uh,</v>

2496
01:52:42.010 --> 01:52:45.020
<v Speaker 2>we were the only civilization I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we were,</v>

2497
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:46.010
<v Speaker 2>we had just started</v>

2498
01:52:46.010 --> 01:52:48.890
<v Speaker 3>civilization back then and no one knew</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it yet.</v>

2499
01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:53.510
<v Speaker 3>And they all caught on and we got fat</v>
<v Speaker 3>off twinkies and the mall and fucking</v>

2500
01:52:53.511 --> 01:52:57.470
<v Speaker 3>walmart poisoned us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then thIs shit from fracking that</v>

2501
01:52:57.471 --> 01:53:00.110
<v Speaker 3>definitely got into the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2502
01:53:00.111 --> 01:53:02.660
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think everyone on,</v>

2503
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:05.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm fine with that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a pessimist in some,</v>

2504
01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:09.200
<v Speaker 3>in some forms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm an optimist and others and what</v>

2505
01:53:09.201 --> 01:53:13.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm optimistic about is that people care</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that this,</v>

2506
01:53:13.950 --> 01:53:16.580
<v Speaker 3>this world that we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this is a,</v>

2507
01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:18.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when everybody was crying after</v>

2508
01:53:18.621 --> 01:53:21.140
<v Speaker 3>trump got elected and part of me was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2509
01:53:21.141 --> 01:53:23.330
<v Speaker 3>well this is so preposterous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like why these people crying?</v>

2510
01:53:23.570 --> 01:53:28.130
<v Speaker 3>But the other part of me was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is when things get done is when you</v>

2511
01:53:28.131 --> 01:53:30.460
<v Speaker 3>have this outpouring of emotion and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>people you know,</v>

2512
01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:33.850
<v Speaker 3>like remember when those people were</v>
<v Speaker 3>marching down wilshire and it was just</v>

2513
01:53:33.860 --> 01:53:37.430
<v Speaker 3>fucking huge line of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like hundreds of thousand people that</v>

2514
01:53:37.431 --> 01:53:40.550
<v Speaker 3>shut down wilshire and these people</v>
<v Speaker 3>filming it with drones from overhead.</v>

2515
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:41.450
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2516
01:53:41.630 --> 01:53:45.620
<v Speaker 3>that's a crazy response to this guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>winning the presidency.</v>

2517
01:53:45.621 --> 01:53:47.930
<v Speaker 3>And the people were like hoping the</v>
<v Speaker 3>electors,</v>

2518
01:53:48.150 --> 01:53:50.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the electoral college people wouldn't</v>

2519
01:53:50.391 --> 01:53:53.660
<v Speaker 3>elect him and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would act on their fuck you.</v>

2520
01:53:53.661 --> 01:53:55.790
<v Speaker 3>It's not gonna happen like you'Re</v>
<v Speaker 3>playing a game.</v>

2521
01:53:55.820 --> 01:53:59.060
<v Speaker 3>he won the game and you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't take it away from him.</v>

2522
01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:00.950
<v Speaker 3>After he won the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he didn't cheat,</v>

2523
01:54:00.980 --> 01:54:04.130
<v Speaker 3>he won the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the game and this is how the</v>

2524
01:54:04.131 --> 01:54:06.410
<v Speaker 3>game works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

2525
01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:09.410
<v Speaker 3>listen to this is the game is how the</v>
<v Speaker 3>game works.</v>

2526
01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:11.510
<v Speaker 3>Now you've got to figure out why is this</v>
<v Speaker 3>game in place?</v>

2527
01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:14.300
<v Speaker 3>Why do you have this fucking goofy game?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you have this representative</v>

2528
01:54:14.301 --> 01:54:14.920
<v Speaker 3>government?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2529
01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:17.240
<v Speaker 3>Why do we continue this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2530
01:54:17.241 --> 01:54:21.350
<v Speaker 3>and if we can slowly move that</v>
<v Speaker 3>battleship and towards a more rational</v>

2531
01:54:21.351 --> 01:54:22.010
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

2532
01:54:22.010 --> 01:54:23.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

2533
01:54:23.001 --> 01:54:24.740
<v Speaker 3>And it does come from a consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 3>shift.</v>

2534
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:27.440
<v Speaker 3>That's the first step.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Always comes from a consciousness shift.</v>

2535
01:54:27.650 --> 01:54:29.920
<v Speaker 3>I think pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think legal pot,</v>

2536
01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:32.990
<v Speaker 3>real gateway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

2537
01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:35.840
<v Speaker 3>I really do because I think it calms</v>
<v Speaker 3>people down.</v>

2538
01:54:35.841 --> 01:54:39.560
<v Speaker 3>It makes people nicer and I think just</v>
<v Speaker 3>that alone,</v>

2539
01:54:39.710 --> 01:54:41.960
<v Speaker 3>it's like the opposite of what alcohol</v>
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>

2540
01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:44.870
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely does not increAse in</v>

2541
01:54:45.110 --> 01:54:49.190
<v Speaker 3>aggression or for confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't increase confidence At all.</v>

2542
01:54:49.191 --> 01:54:50.960
<v Speaker 3>It's the opposite for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes me.</v>

2543
01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:53.000
<v Speaker 3>That's why I don't smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more vulnerable,</v>

2544
01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:54.950
<v Speaker 3>you don't smoke it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

2545
01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:59.060
<v Speaker 3>Don't like something changed in me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did when I was at duke when I was a</v>

2546
01:54:59.061 --> 01:55:00.800
<v Speaker 3>teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like loved it,</v>

2547
01:55:00.801 --> 01:55:03.320
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when my dad had and that was my life,</v>

2548
01:55:03.321 --> 01:55:06.740
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take it now and it's just paranoia,</v>

2549
01:55:07.220 --> 01:55:09.440
<v Speaker 3>massive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also the confidence thing.</v>

2550
01:55:09.441 --> 01:55:14.441
<v Speaker 3>It does not bring out my best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes me feel like if we smoked and</v>

2551
01:55:14.541 --> 01:55:18.030
<v Speaker 3>we did this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so be freaking out and I have to say to</v>

<v Speaker 3>don't get told me I wouldn't be like</v>

2553
01:55:25.371 --> 01:55:28.400
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it just does not bring up my best.</v>

<v Speaker 1>learned to hang up the phone.</v>

2585
01:56:34.340 --> 01:56:37.220
<v Speaker 1>I didn't need to stay on the phone with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2586
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.991
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2589
01:56:41.591 --> 01:56:43.470
<v Speaker 2>the message over and over and over and</v>
<v Speaker 2>over again.</v>

2590
01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think was in that boat too.</v>

2591
01:56:45.401 --> 01:56:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Before his death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were saying that he talked a lot</v>

2592
01:56:48.041 --> 01:56:49.780
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he really wasn't doing anything</v>

2593
01:56:49.781 --> 01:56:50.710
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

2594
01:56:50.711 --> 01:56:52.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that he smoked a lot of</v>

2595
01:56:52.541 --> 01:56:54.760
<v Speaker 2>pot though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did smoke a little pot because I always</v>

2596
01:56:54.761 --> 01:56:55.080
<v Speaker 2>remember it,</v>

2597
01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:55.913
<v Speaker 1>terrence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2598
01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:58.670
<v Speaker 1>the thing that struck people have his</v>
<v Speaker 1>room</v>

2599
01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:01.820
<v Speaker 2>pete ability is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's true,</v>

2600
01:57:01.821 --> 01:57:05.600
<v Speaker 2>but I know it's tough to have 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking mushroom trips and with jesus</v>

2601
01:57:05.601 --> 01:57:07.860
<v Speaker 2>christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've done acid what 200 times or</v>

2602
01:57:07.861 --> 01:57:11.810
<v Speaker 2>something you could probably see like</v>
<v Speaker 2>legally insane.</v>

2603
01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:13.130
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

2604
01:57:13.131 --> 01:57:16.310
<v Speaker 2>I think like there'S a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>acid trips you do where they used to</v>

2605
01:57:16.850 --> 01:57:19.970
<v Speaker 2>classify you as being legally insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2606
01:57:19.971 --> 01:57:21.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe you get some money from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

2607

2609
01:57:27.890 --> 01:57:32.240

<v Speaker 1>and it's really seductive and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up of making you think that your</v>

2633
01:58:27.201 --> 01:58:29.750
<v Speaker 1>life is okay when you're in the gutter.</v>

2634
01:58:30.950 --> 01:58:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has that sort of,</v>

2635
01:58:32.840 --> 01:58:36.860
<v Speaker 1>that shooting that it just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble it puts over you.</v>

2636
01:58:37.100 --> 01:58:40.430
<v Speaker 1>You can be literally living in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>alleyway.</v>

2637
01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Highend heroin thinking you got it going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

2638
01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:43.901
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2639
01:58:43.901 --> 01:58:46.360
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird and perverse like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2640
01:58:46.630 --> 01:58:48.060
<v Speaker 1>And at that time in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>YEah.</v>

2641
01:58:48.061 --> 01:58:49.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad just died.</v>

2642
01:58:49.610 --> 01:58:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2643
01:58:51.131 --> 01:58:52.570
<v Speaker 1>when he died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what with it,</v>

2644
01:58:52.630 --> 01:58:57.630
<v Speaker 1>what went with it was kind of my life up</v>
<v Speaker 1>until I was 22 up until that point.</v>

2645
01:58:57.641 --> 01:58:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life was in that bubble,</v>

2646
01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:01.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was larger than life.</v>

2647
01:59:01.871 --> 01:59:03.910
<v Speaker 1>He was famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2648
01:59:03.940 --> 01:59:07.420
<v Speaker 1>girls came with that work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came with that scene,</v>

2649
01:59:07.450 --> 01:59:10.690
<v Speaker 1>came with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends came with that and when he died</v>

2650
01:59:10.691 --> 01:59:14.200
<v Speaker 1>that just went poof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Girls want to bang you because you were.</v>

2651
01:59:14.340 --> 01:59:15.071
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

2652
01:59:15.071 --> 01:59:16.270
<v Speaker 1>The leary course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2653
01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It worked out for awhile.</v>

2654
01:59:20.650 --> 01:59:22.510
<v Speaker 1>Did you put on like a guru attitude?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2655
01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:26.440
<v Speaker 1>oh god laughs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got it all going on ladies at that</v>

2656
01:59:26.441 --> 01:59:27.274
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2657
01:59:27.550 --> 01:59:30.010
<v Speaker 1>that stage in my life now it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>

2658
01:59:31.830 --> 01:59:33.770
<v Speaker 1>And I tried to do that now though on</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasion.</v>

2659
01:59:33.970 --> 01:59:34.511
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

2660
01:59:34.511 --> 01:59:36.090
<v Speaker 1>I had a good story man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's really funny,</v>

2661
01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:38.980
<v Speaker 1>like you were talking about soliciting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government for money for being an</v>

2662
01:59:38.981 --> 01:59:40.600
<v Speaker 1>acid casualties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a good idea.</v>

2663
01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:43.270
<v Speaker 1>But I was really high on crack once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2664
01:59:43.410 --> 01:59:46.150
<v Speaker 1>and just kind of on a bender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just losing my mind and crack.</v>

2665
01:59:46.151 --> 01:59:48.550
<v Speaker 1>And I thought in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>night,</v>

2666
01:59:49.090 --> 01:59:54.090
<v Speaker 1>be a really good idea to join the cia</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they would want me,</v>

2667
01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:56.590
<v Speaker 1>me specifically being like tim leary's</v>
<v Speaker 1>kit,</v>

2668
01:59:56.660 --> 02:00:01.220
<v Speaker 1>they'd want me because I have access to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that they want access to.</v>

2669
02:00:01.730 --> 02:00:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Like I can be an insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a mole and it was high on crack</v>

2670
02:00:04.751 --> 02:00:05.590
<v Speaker 1>and I downloaded.</v>

2671
02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:10.180
<v Speaker 1>I filled out the form that deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got that deep.</v>

2672
02:00:10.181 --> 02:00:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I spent hours on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really long.</v>

2673
02:00:12.221 --> 02:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Complicated though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole kind of joined the cia,</v>

2674
02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:17.380
<v Speaker 1>printed out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sent it in the mail.</v>

2675
02:00:18.610 --> 02:00:21.310
<v Speaker 1>you're in the cia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you there with anderson cooper and he</v>

2676
02:00:21.311 --> 02:00:25.210
<v Speaker 1>worked for cnn and you're in there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>never heard back.</v>

2677
02:00:25.211 --> 02:00:27.120
<v Speaker 1>But I never heard back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never,</v>

2678
02:00:27.410 --> 02:00:30.430
<v Speaker 1>never seen laughing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he just laughed and threw it in the</v>

2679
02:00:30.431 --> 02:00:32.770
<v Speaker 1>garbage and shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was really funny and kind of a</v>

2680
02:00:32.771 --> 02:00:35.320
<v Speaker 1>great delusional high on drugs moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2681
02:00:35.321 --> 02:00:37.510
<v Speaker 1>So what did you think that you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do?</v>

2682
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Like as a operative going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to fix it from the inside with</v>

2683
02:00:42.851 --> 02:00:46.520
<v Speaker 1>crack</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2684
02:00:47.260 --> 02:00:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something crazy,</v>

2685
02:00:48.971 --> 02:00:50.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that's what a crackhead does.</v>

2686
02:00:51.150 --> 02:00:52.870
<v Speaker 1>How did you get another crack in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin?</v>

2687
02:00:53.710 --> 02:00:55.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2688
02:00:55.300 --> 02:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>just recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you go the 12 step away or narcotics</v>

2689
02:01:00.881 --> 02:01:01.420
<v Speaker 1>anonymous?</v>

2690
02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>That kind of stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2691
02:01:02.660 --> 02:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>worked for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does,</v>

2692
02:01:04.420 --> 02:01:05.920
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that one of those things you have to</v>

2693
02:01:05.921 --> 02:01:09.220
<v Speaker 1>continually visit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to constantly have meetings</v>

2694
02:01:09.221 --> 02:01:10.240
<v Speaker 1>and stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2695
02:01:10.540 --> 02:01:11.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2696
02:01:11.441 --> 02:01:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2697
02:01:14.951 --> 02:01:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of in a way as a card carrying</v>
<v Speaker 1>members where I'm kind of not the best</v>

2698
02:01:19.781 --> 02:01:23.500
<v Speaker 1>card carrying member of it and I break</v>
<v Speaker 1>from tradition and a little bit in that</v>

2699
02:01:23.501 --> 02:01:25.060
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2700
02:01:25.090 --> 02:01:27.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a zealot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2701
02:01:27.370 --> 02:01:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2702
02:01:28.750 --> 02:01:29.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you do,</v>

2703
02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:34.120
<v Speaker 1>but for me I just happened to like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just enjoy it.</v>

2704
02:01:34.150 --> 02:01:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not I have to go and all my</v>
<v Speaker 1>god,</v>

2705
02:01:36.671 --> 02:01:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I don't know I'm gonna end up back in</v>

2706
02:01:38.801 --> 02:01:39.634
<v Speaker 1>the gutter of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2707
02:01:39.930 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

2708
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:42.230
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe there's a little hysteria with</v>

2709
02:01:42.231 --> 02:01:44.390
<v Speaker 2>that and that's kind of like the party</v>
<v Speaker 2>line,</v>

2710
02:01:45.590 --> 02:01:48.410
<v Speaker 2>which sometimes bothers me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It bothers a lot of people,</v>

2711
02:01:49.090 --> 02:01:51.670
<v Speaker 2>sort of disempowerment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disempowerment.</v>

2712
02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:54.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that to any with any</v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition or anything like,</v>

2713
02:01:54.651 --> 02:01:57.830
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you leave us the shit's gonna hit the</v>

2714
02:01:57.831 --> 02:01:58.391
<v Speaker 2>fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2715
02:01:58.391 --> 02:02:00.680
<v Speaker 2>you stop and think about a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>destructive things you did when you were</v>

2716
02:02:00.681 --> 02:02:02.810
<v Speaker 2>younger that you don't do now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2717
02:02:02.970 --> 02:02:06.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't need a 12 step program to tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>me not to do stupid shit.</v>

2718
02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2719
02:02:07.010 --> 02:02:09.500
<v Speaker 2>I just know it's stupid shit and so I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do it anymore.</v>

2720
02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:13.880
<v Speaker 2>But the idea that you could potentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall into that is what they hold over</v>

2721
02:02:13.881 --> 02:02:16.190
<v Speaker 2>your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that simple.</v>

2722
02:02:16.191 --> 02:02:16.881
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

2723
02:02:16.881 --> 02:02:18.320
<v Speaker 2>I know heroin was going to kill me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm just.</v>

2724
02:02:18.490 --> 02:02:19.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to stop doing it.</v>

2725
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:21.860
<v Speaker 2>It's not that rational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sadly.</v>

2726
02:02:21.890 --> 02:02:24.530
<v Speaker 2>I wish it was that difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the disconnect?</v>

2727
02:02:24.770 --> 02:02:29.770
<v Speaker 2>The disconnect is that in order to bill</v>
<v Speaker 2>wilson was really a groundbreaking dude.</v>

2728
02:02:30.710 --> 02:02:32.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was also an acid head,</v>

2729
02:02:32.331 --> 02:02:34.990
<v Speaker 2>which is really kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill wilson being the guy who founded</v>

2730
02:02:35.010 --> 02:02:39.920
<v Speaker 2>alcoholics anonymous five times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also thought that acid could be a</v>

2731
02:02:39.921 --> 02:02:42.590
<v Speaker 2>viable treatment method for people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are alcoholics.</v>

2732
02:02:42.890 --> 02:02:47.890
<v Speaker 2>It's completely ignored today and his</v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts and ideas about that completely</v>

2733
02:02:48.921 --> 02:02:52.340
<v Speaker 2>ignored by people in recovery because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think that no,</v>

2734
02:02:52.341 --> 02:02:52.970
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2735
02:02:52.970 --> 02:02:56.170
<v Speaker 2>You don't get get cleaned by taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>

2736
02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:57.360
<v Speaker 2>They hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2737
02:02:57.370 --> 02:02:58.760
<v Speaker 2>And I before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2738
02:02:58.850 --> 02:03:00.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of got popular and before the</v>

2739
02:03:00.831 --> 02:03:03.860
<v Speaker 2>documentary came out and all that about</v>
<v Speaker 2>exposing bill wilson,</v>

2740
02:03:04.430 --> 02:03:05.750
<v Speaker 2>I used it to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>below,</v>

2741
02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:08.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a member's minds with that to do not.</v>

2742
02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:11.750
<v Speaker 2>He did it and he had correspondence with</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dad when he was at harvard.</v>

2743
02:03:11.810 --> 02:03:13.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had some really interesting.</v>

2744
02:03:13.710 --> 02:03:15.560
<v Speaker 2>These letters are fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2745
02:03:16.970 --> 02:03:17.990
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2746
02:03:17.991 --> 02:03:22.991
<v Speaker 2>he called it the great egos sublimate</v>
<v Speaker 2>her and thought it could be the solution</v>

2747
02:03:23.301 --> 02:03:26.490
<v Speaker 2>for alcoholism and he did not change his</v>
<v Speaker 2>sobriety date,</v>

2748
02:03:28.670 --> 02:03:31.220
<v Speaker 2>which is highly controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sobriety date,</v>

2749
02:03:31.580 --> 02:03:33.500
<v Speaker 2>friday date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when he said he got sober,</v>

2750
02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:35.270
<v Speaker 2>he still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he died,</v>

2751
02:03:35.271 --> 02:03:39.710
<v Speaker 2>he said he had whatever 48 years sober,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was still doing acid when he had</v>

2752
02:03:39.711 --> 02:03:41.690
<v Speaker 2>stopped doing acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But typically,</v>

2753
02:03:41.691 --> 02:03:42.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

2754
02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:44.330
<v Speaker 2>in a world if you do asset,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

2755
02:03:44.331 --> 02:03:46.760
<v Speaker 2>You start over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start day one and day one.</v>

2756
02:03:46.761 --> 02:03:48.170
<v Speaker 2>But he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did not.</v>

2757
02:03:48.171 --> 02:03:51.930
<v Speaker 2>I looked at acid has been completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>different than an intoxicant like</v>

2758
02:03:52.070 --> 02:03:55.040
<v Speaker 2>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a neuro psychotropic therapeutic</v>

2759
02:03:55.100 --> 02:03:57.800
<v Speaker 2>agent you referred to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2760
02:03:57.801 --> 02:04:00.830
<v Speaker 2>I think that is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think this blanket statement,</v>

2761
02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:03.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs that word drugs,</v>

2762
02:04:03.771 --> 02:04:04.590
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2763
02:04:04.590 --> 02:04:07.400
<v Speaker 2>it applies to too many things to do too</v>
<v Speaker 2>many different things.</v>

2764
02:04:07.420 --> 02:04:08.930
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like food,</v>

2765
02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:11.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>food is bad for you.</v>

2766
02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:12.171
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2767
02:04:12.171 --> 02:04:14.930
<v Speaker 2>no foods not bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this food is bad for you.</v>

2768
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:15.651
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2769
02:04:15.651 --> 02:04:17.660
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like the salads.</v>

2770
02:04:17.661 --> 02:04:19.280
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's food too.</v>

2771
02:04:19.490 --> 02:04:21.170
<v Speaker 2>And that's the problem with drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drugs,</v>

2772
02:04:21.470 --> 02:04:25.220
<v Speaker 2>the word drugs applies to things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are highly beneficial.</v>

2773
02:04:25.610 --> 02:04:26.630
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2774
02:04:26.631 --> 02:04:27.111
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2775
02:04:27.111 --> 02:04:30.320
<v Speaker 2>in a land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get why they need to tell her that</v>

2776
02:04:30.590 --> 02:04:34.280
<v Speaker 2>that company line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I do get it because again,</v>

2777
02:04:34.281 --> 02:04:35.840
<v Speaker 2>it's disempowering in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

2778
02:04:35.841 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're treating everybody as</v>

2779
02:04:38.070 --> 02:04:40.980
<v Speaker 1>if you are the weakest possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>examples.</v>

2780
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.551
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look man,</v>

2781
02:04:41.551 --> 02:04:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not disagreeing with you at all,</v>

2782
02:04:43.530 --> 02:04:48.030
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just saying I get it because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>does work.</v>

2783
02:04:48.060 --> 02:04:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I can say about it and I</v>

2784
02:04:50.101 --> 02:04:52.350
<v Speaker 1>don't disagree with I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of wishy washy about it,</v>

2785
02:04:52.351 --> 02:04:54.900
<v Speaker 1>but it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have a hard line.</v>

2786
02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I have seen people's lives who you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>went,</v>

2787
02:04:57.450 --> 02:04:58.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2788
02:04:58.080 --> 02:04:59.460
<v Speaker 1>the doldrums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2789
02:04:59.550 --> 02:05:00.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the disinfect,</v>

2790
02:05:00.721 --> 02:05:02.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left for dead,</v>

2791
02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:06.420
<v Speaker 1>get their life saved and have really</v>
<v Speaker 1>great productive,</v>

2792
02:05:06.421 --> 02:05:08.910
<v Speaker 1>amazing life today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a really beautiful,</v>

2793
02:05:08.911 --> 02:05:10.790
<v Speaker 1>cool thing to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this all sides,</v>

2794
02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:11.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2795
02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:15.150
<v Speaker 1>we have to come to the realization that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's different.</v>

2796
02:05:15.151 --> 02:05:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Biological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2797
02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:17.640
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why that that's the point.</v>

2798
02:05:17.670 --> 02:05:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's wired differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no one size fits all thing.</v>

2799
02:05:20.851 --> 02:05:22.500
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now what we're seeing with ibogaine</v>

2800
02:05:22.501 --> 02:05:24.060
<v Speaker 1>treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that map system,</v>

2801
02:05:24.070 --> 02:05:24.903
<v Speaker 1>oh my god.</v>

2802
02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:26.070
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so cool.</v>

2803
02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

2804
02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:28.230
<v Speaker 1>really promising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2805
02:05:28.700 --> 02:05:31.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just encourage everybody to find their</v>

2806
02:05:31.831 --> 02:05:34.020
<v Speaker 1>own dharma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find their own path and you kind of make</v>

2807
02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.220
<v Speaker 1>what works for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2808
02:05:35.221 --> 02:05:39.420
<v Speaker 1>there's no prescribed method for</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual awakening or life saving or</v>

2809
02:05:39.421 --> 02:05:40.380
<v Speaker 1>life changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2810
02:05:40.381 --> 02:05:42.120
<v Speaker 1>you just have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2811
02:05:42.150 --> 02:05:43.860
<v Speaker 1>balance it correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So listen to your heart,</v>

2812
02:05:43.950 --> 02:05:45.660
<v Speaker 1>what is your life like?</v>

2813
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:48.360
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with your time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do for money?</v>

2814
02:05:49.940 --> 02:05:51.080
<v Speaker 1>I do a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

2815
02:05:51.090 --> 02:05:55.230
<v Speaker 1>My life is kind of split into two things</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have in my podcast.</v>

2816
02:05:55.560 --> 02:05:57.870
<v Speaker 1>What is that called again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all happening.</v>

2817
02:05:58.110 --> 02:05:59.210
<v Speaker 1>It's all happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2818
02:05:59.410 --> 02:06:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I do that.</v>

2819
02:06:01.830 --> 02:06:04.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually starting another podcast.</v>

2820
02:06:05.010 --> 02:06:07.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be hosting the maps</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

2821
02:06:07.170 --> 02:06:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So maps is going to help them get off</v>

2823
02:06:11.071 --> 02:06:12.900
<v Speaker 1>the ground and host it and start that.</v>

2824
02:06:12.990 --> 02:06:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2825
02:06:14.851 --> 02:06:16.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of do that.</v>

2826
02:06:16.081 --> 02:06:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I can speak or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at festivals and kind of teach,</v>

2827
02:06:19.670 --> 02:06:20.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

2828
02:06:20.490 --> 02:06:22.680
<v Speaker 1>some spiritual stuff and kind of do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2829
02:06:22.681 --> 02:06:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been working on the book,</v>

2830
02:06:24.391 --> 02:06:28.980
<v Speaker 1>but the other half of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of before I had my own little</v>

2831
02:06:28.981 --> 02:06:31.890
<v Speaker 1>spiritual awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a technology consultant in the</v>

2832
02:06:31.891 --> 02:06:35.700
<v Speaker 1>branding consultant and worked in</v>
<v Speaker 1>digital marketing and at a lot of ad</v>

2833
02:06:35.701 --> 02:06:39.180
<v Speaker 1>agencies and stuff and they'd kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine to five corporate life,</v>

2834
02:06:39.181 --> 02:06:40.350
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ditched.</v>

2835
02:06:40.410 --> 02:06:43.050
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still keep some clients as kind of a</v>

2836
02:06:43.230 --> 02:06:45.300
<v Speaker 1>day job sort of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of fun.</v>

2837
02:06:45.330 --> 02:06:46.560
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like what,</v>

2838
02:06:46.610 --> 02:06:50.070
<v Speaker 1>what does that entail as far as anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

2839
02:06:50.071 --> 02:06:50.521
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2840
02:06:50.521 --> 02:06:55.521
<v Speaker 1>if a brand or an entity or a film or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>music client,</v>

2841
02:06:55.621 --> 02:06:59.100
<v Speaker 1>anybody wants to come to me and sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>define their internet strategy,</v>

2842
02:06:59.250 --> 02:07:02.020
<v Speaker 1>how they want to behave online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2843
02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:06.570
<v Speaker 1>whether that's just something as mundane</v>
<v Speaker 1>as having a new website to coming up</v>

2844
02:07:06.571 --> 02:07:10.320
<v Speaker 1>with a complete communication message</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how they want to market their,</v>

2845
02:07:11.040 --> 02:07:13.350
<v Speaker 1>their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of do that too.</v>

2846
02:07:13.950 --> 02:07:18.000
<v Speaker 1>So I divide my time sort of 50 slash 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>between my stuff and then other</v>

2847
02:07:18.001 --> 02:07:20.280
<v Speaker 1>people's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when is this map's podcast launch?</v>
