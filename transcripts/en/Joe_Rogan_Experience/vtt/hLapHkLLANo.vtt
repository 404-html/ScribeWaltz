<v Speaker 1>around Hollywood bed.</v>

46
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm starting to realize something about </v>
<v Speaker 3>myself,</v>

47
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 3>which is a standard.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he talked his way into a fortune and </v>

51
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.170
<v Speaker 3>which always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now I realize what he means just </v>

52
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.111
<v Speaker 3>because I've been doing a lot of road </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows and gigs and shit and you just </v>

53
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:30.111
<v Speaker 3>have to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

54
00:02:30.111 --> 00:02:32.350
<v Speaker 3>But you got to go do radio and talk and </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk and talk and you just.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It doesn't feel like work to me to go </v>

57
00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:38.121
<v Speaker 3>when people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you hate doing ready?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

59
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:43.200
<v Speaker 3>You go and tell jokes and be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you think of something new.</v>

60
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.570
<v Speaker 3>It seems all right to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't bother me.</v>

61
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>just talk and shit.</v>

64

<v Speaker 3>I'm just a bullshitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is like,</v>

69

<v Speaker 3>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll.</v>

74
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.820
<v Speaker 3>They can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll get a little bit better if </v>

75
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.820
<v Speaker 3>there's a social center.</v>

76

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there some about like the pressure of</v>

79
00:03:25.821 --> 00:03:29.150
<v Speaker 3>having that human thing that you need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>please,</v>

80
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.330

<v Speaker 3>you like and respect.</v>

81
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 3>That's why I like writing with a guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm friends with you because it's like,</v>

82
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.420
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to,</v>

83
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't want to have to pitch to a guy </v>

84
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 3>that I secretly don't think is funny.</v>

85
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's something about bouncing </v>

86
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.301
<v Speaker 4>some of off likeminded people's heads </v>
<v Speaker 4>that also allows you to come up with </v>

87
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:50.180
<v Speaker 4>some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

88
00:03:50.181 --> 00:03:55.181
<v Speaker 4>when you know a guy's already got </v>
<v Speaker 4>several steps of the puzzle figured out </v>

89
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:56.480
<v Speaker 4>along with you and that Nigga.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>

90
00:03:56.481 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other thing is the,</v>

91
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.210
<v Speaker 3>there's that Chappelle used to say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he and I were like thrilled killers </v>

92
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 3>where he'd like stabbed the person and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

93
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 3>good her fucking head off Dave because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just so like,</v>

94
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to one up that person.</v>

95
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:15.690
<v Speaker 3>Then he went up to you and then and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got like a vineyard,</v>

96
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.160
<v Speaker 3>you're talking and then you really don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

97
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.120
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's always offends me when people put</v>

98
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.350
<v Speaker 4>comedians on the line for really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really outrageous shit.</v>

99
00:04:24.351 --> 00:04:29.351
<v Speaker 4>They said onstage as if they really mean</v>
<v Speaker 4>that drives me nuts sometimes because </v>

100
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 4>half of what we do is try to say the </v>
<v Speaker 4>most fucked up thing.</v>

101
00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:40.511
<v Speaker 4>Like you didn't just fucking go there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you're talking to a bunch of </v>

102
00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:40.511
<v Speaker 4>comics and you're hanging out with </v>
<v Speaker 4>comics,</v>

103
00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:41.070
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

104
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.180
<v Speaker 4>we're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to go to the most fucked up </v>

105
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 4>place possible because that's the only </v>
<v Speaker 4>way to make the person laugh,</v>

106
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.190
<v Speaker 4>to get us to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That gets us off anymore.</v>

107
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we endorsed the idea of whenever it is </v>

108
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.130
<v Speaker 4>beastiality anything,</v>

109
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not,</v>

110
00:04:56.381 --> 00:04:57.970
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing in my,</v>

111
00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a fact,</v>

112
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:03.320
<v Speaker 3>this is written in stone and this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

113
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 3>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's an idea,</v>

114
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.380
<v Speaker 3>here's another idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't mean that if your brain goes </v>

115
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.380
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

116
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.671
<v Speaker 3>It goes back to that tracy argument of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like what Morgan tracey Morgan the other</v>

117
00:05:15.221 --> 00:05:20.221
<v Speaker 3>night at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a joke about a mark twain and how </v>

118
00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:25.831
<v Speaker 3>they're taking all the words out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Huckleberry Finn and I ended up saying </v>

119
00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:28.680
<v Speaker 3>nigger like seven times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever had a problem with that at</v>

120
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 3>all black rooms because I never say it </v>
<v Speaker 3>as myself.</v>

121
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:36.631
<v Speaker 3>Of course I say it as in yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finally a girl in the audience goes,</v>

122
00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

124
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 3>you can't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

125
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't a black girl?</v>

126
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.950
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why can't I?</v>

127
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 3>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

128
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:48.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't in here and call you cracker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and I didn't,</v>

131
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.680
<v Speaker 3>didn't bother me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got The show back.</v>

132
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.790
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Righted the ship.</v>

133
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 3>We ended up talking for about an hour </v>
<v Speaker 3>after the show.</v>

134
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 3>Me and the girl and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

135
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before I did that joke,</v>

136
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:07.001
<v Speaker 3>I specifically did jokes about Mexicans </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Asians and you didn't have any </v>

137
00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:07.001
<v Speaker 3>problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>

138
00:06:07.001 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have.</v>

139
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>

140
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 3>your problem is with racism against </v>
<v Speaker 3>black people,</v>

141
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.520
<v Speaker 3>but not all racism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fine with racism at large,</v>

142
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.940
<v Speaker 3>but you're cool with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're against it when it's against </v>

143
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 3>black people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which she's like,</v>

144
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a hypocrite.</v>

145
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 3>So we ended up having like a half hour </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion.</v>

146
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:28.490
<v Speaker 3>She walks away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She one of these people who like,</v>

147
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 3>she's never lost an argument in her </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

148
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.750
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just didn't even when I wasn't.</v>

149
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 3>So like she doesn't know why I won the </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument.</v>

150
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 3>She walks away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You and I know.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she walks,</v>

153
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.350
<v Speaker 3>she walks away and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and her husband goes,</v>

154
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

155
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Speaker 3>I know that you don't have any hate in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your heart.</v>

156
00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.140
<v Speaker 3>Problem is she does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She does have.</v>

157
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.310
<v Speaker 3>So she had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had said during the conversation </v>

158
00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.771
<v Speaker 3>that's been dropped on you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that dude's a week away from telling </v>

159
00:06:59.771 --> 00:06:59.771
<v Speaker 3>that bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:00.890
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just say that to random people at the</v>

161
00:07:00.891 --> 00:07:02.550
<v Speaker 3>comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's got her heart.</v>

162
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.890
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

163
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.900
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't saying it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just saying it like she's got </v>

164
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:11.531
<v Speaker 3>like she is up the mind that white </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are constantly saying the n word </v>

165
00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:11.531
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

166
00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:11.531
<v Speaker 3>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

167
00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 3>I told her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know how many times I've heard it </v>

168
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.890
<v Speaker 3>without a speak for yourself saying that</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's saying that she said she recognizes</v>

169
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.860
<v Speaker 3>the argument that she thinks that white </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are constantly using the emerald </v>

170
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:23.860
<v Speaker 3>wise will run around.</v>

171
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like if a guy uses the n word in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way,</v>

172
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.940
<v Speaker 3>if he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he's not being funny because there's </v>

173
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.450
<v Speaker 3>no humor to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did get disgusted.</v>

174
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.500
<v Speaker 3>That's how many times I haven't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard it without a sense of humor or I </v>

175
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:44.430
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I've heard it five times and I </v>

<v Speaker 3>I've heard a guy at times,</v>

181
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been around people that were </v>

182
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:57.280
<v Speaker 3>looking to jump racists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's creepy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's creepy to here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

184
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.470
<v Speaker 3>and these fucking Niggas and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

187
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

188
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.850
<v Speaker 3>Just because some black people did some </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up shit,</v>

189
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.610
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever seen gone with the wind?</v>

190
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I have,</v>

191
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:13.160
<v Speaker 3>but it was a long time ago.</v>

192
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.220
<v Speaker 3>That is the most racist movie in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole entire world.</v>

193
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:17.900
<v Speaker 3>I just watched it from my first time </v>
<v Speaker 3>recently.</v>

194
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:22.901
<v Speaker 3>I think it was 1930.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've ever watched watches </v>

195
00:08:22.901 --> 00:08:25.450
<v Speaker 3>39 because the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one guy a directed a gone with the wind </v>

196
00:08:25.581 --> 00:08:28.190
<v Speaker 3>and wizard of Oz in the same year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he did wizard of Oz.</v>

197
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 3>Well that makes completely sense because</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

198
00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:34.640
<v Speaker 3>because I thought it feels like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wizard of Oz but racist and,</v>

199
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.440
<v Speaker 3>and there was the same like production </v>
<v Speaker 3>design in the same feeling of it.</v>

200
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was one scene where it was late at</v>

201
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.050
<v Speaker 3>night and there was like tons of little </v>
<v Speaker 3>white children in their beds.</v>

202
00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:50.051
<v Speaker 3>And then there's this black child </v>
<v Speaker 3>cranking this fan to fan all the white </v>

203
00:08:50.051 --> 00:08:51.800
<v Speaker 3>children when they slept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

204
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:57.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was the part where the main </v>

205
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 3>actors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one that Clark Gable says,</v>

206
00:08:58.201 --> 00:08:58.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>frankly my dear,</v>

207
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a damn that girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she has like a slave and she's like</v>

208
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:07.101
<v Speaker 3>slapping the slave in the face because </v>
<v Speaker 3>she wouldn't shut up or something like </v>

209
00:09:07.101 --> 00:09:07.101
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

210
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 3>It is so uncomfortable to watch and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize the Clark Gable guy like I </v>

211
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 3>don't know what ethnicity he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

212
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.650
<v Speaker 3>he was like from Glendale or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

213
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:18.870
<v Speaker 3>Like I never thought this was supposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be like this,</v>

214
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.190
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like handsome,</v>

215
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:21.660
<v Speaker 3>striking young man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he looked like somebody.</v>

216
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.430
<v Speaker 3>This guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he,</v>

217
00:09:23.431 --> 00:09:24.450
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was weird.</v>

218
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he didn't look like a leading man.</v>

219
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:33.350
<v Speaker 3>So like you're used to like the rock say</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a big manly hands had this guy </v>

220
00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.960
<v Speaker 3>looked like a little rocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The rocket will know you're talking </v>

221
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.310
<v Speaker 3>about he racially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looked,</v>

222
00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:43.370
<v Speaker 3>he looked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just like for back then it seemed </v>

223
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 3>like such a racist movie then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they had like,</v>

224
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 3>they would have gone after him now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

225
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:48.540
<v Speaker 3>It would have felt like a little Mexican</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking dude.</v>

226
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one of those standard Mexicans like</v>

227
00:09:50.761 --> 00:09:52.170
<v Speaker 3>Oscar de la Hoya,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexicans,</v>

228
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:57.171
<v Speaker 3>maybe it was stolen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but gone with the wind I thought was a </v>

229
00:09:57.171 --> 00:09:57.171
<v Speaker 3>creepy ass movie.</v>

230

<v Speaker 3>So that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the woman who won the,</v>

235
00:10:08.241 --> 00:10:08.350
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

236
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:13.460
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole thing though is so creepy </v>

237
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.100
<v Speaker 3>because now they have the intermissions </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the opening sound.</v>

238
00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:19.101
<v Speaker 3>What used to play in the movie theater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting there for 15 minutes in the </v>

239
00:10:19.101 --> 00:10:21.000
<v Speaker 3>middle of the making about listening to </v>
<v Speaker 3>piano music,</v>

240
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:26.030
<v Speaker 3>thinking about racism winds like what is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the plot of them who wins?</v>

241
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.440
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just so fascinated with the racism</v>

242
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:33.120
<v Speaker 3>that I don't even remember what the plot</v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

243
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:33.960
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

244
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.880
<v Speaker 3>It was freaking me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The video,</v>

245
00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:39.470
<v Speaker 3>the image of the black boy fanning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

246
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:44.780
<v Speaker 3>it's creeped and there's so many little </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that in the movie put to </v>

247
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.150
<v Speaker 3>wizard of Oz feeling to it.</v>

248
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.940
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that this movie is supposed</v>

249
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:52.941
<v Speaker 3>to reflect the genuine racism of the era</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was depicting or 39.</v>

250
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:58.611
<v Speaker 3>So it wasn't even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were still people alive from that </v>

251
00:10:58.611 --> 00:10:59.490
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when was 39?</v>

252
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

253
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.910
<v Speaker 3>It was the first color movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe that.</v>

254
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.680
<v Speaker 3>Or one of the first color movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

255
00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:05.670
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

256
00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 3>I think it might've been the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first.</v>

257
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.490
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

258
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.420
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

259
00:11:09.421 --> 00:11:14.421
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that it was so it's not like it </v>

260
00:11:14.421 --> 00:11:14.421
<v Speaker 3>was made in [inaudible] 78 and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking like,</v>

261
00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.850
<v Speaker 3>there were still black people still </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't vote when the movie came out.</v>

262
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:23.320
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have to fan you anymore to </v>
<v Speaker 3>drink it,</v>

263
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.180
<v Speaker 3>but they couldn't afford for vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

264
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Old Movies,</v>

265
00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:32.600
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old movies will trip you out or other.</v>

266
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.210
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

267
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:40.400
<v Speaker 3>the in the godfather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone goes let's sell drugs in their </v>

268
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:40.680
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their animals.</v>

269
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember seeing that and going </v>

270
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.151
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a little rough like as an adult </v>

271
00:11:47.151 --> 00:11:49.140
<v Speaker 3>probably 20 going like maybe cut that </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

272
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:54.380
<v Speaker 3>Like Mooney always makes the joke that </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that they aired on </v>

273
00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.381
<v Speaker 3>television pretty irresponsible or is </v>
<v Speaker 3>this sort of like fucked up Dave and </v>

274
00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:03.271
<v Speaker 3>introduced that idea that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody that would listen to that guy </v>

275
00:12:03.271 --> 00:12:05.690
<v Speaker 3>and think he was making sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dangerous.</v>

276
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you talking about Mooney or the guy?</v>

277
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.940
<v Speaker 3>The Guy Saying that and the Godfather?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

278
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:16.240
<v Speaker 3>it's messy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a little black child and you </v>

279
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:16.240
<v Speaker 3>have to fucking listen to that now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think they should cgi,</v>

280
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.570
<v Speaker 3>they should eat that gun out of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these movies.</v>

281
00:12:19.571 --> 00:12:23.740
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>CGI that did was create a work</v>

282
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:28.810
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then work of art reflects a honest </v>

283
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:29.150
<v Speaker 4>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you put it on television,</v>

284
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.430
<v Speaker 4>it's a very tricky thing and if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to hear that on tbs,</v>

285
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.650
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if they,</v>

286
00:12:36.651 --> 00:12:37.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>

287
00:12:37.701 --> 00:12:39.230
<v Speaker 3>if it went in there is on television.</v>

288
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:42.250
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't endorse them censoring it,</v>

289
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:47.490
<v Speaker 4>but I don't get to see where people </v>
<v Speaker 4>would not want their kids to be exposed </v>

290
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:49.780
<v Speaker 4>to certain things that are in certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>movies more than Jackson.</v>

291
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.370
<v Speaker 4>If you could just flip through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>channels,</v>

292
00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:52.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's easy to get to something.</v>

293
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.760
<v Speaker 3>What was the first moment you saw that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were like,</v>

294
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:55.930
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't.</v>

295
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:56.860
<v Speaker 3>This is an adult.</v>

296
00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.580
<v Speaker 4>My parents took me to a drive in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was some Kung Fu movie.</v>

297
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.180
<v Speaker 4>I was a real little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I remember my mom being pissed off.</v>

298
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:05.890
<v Speaker 3>I got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't surprise me.</v>

299
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:11.190
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't frighten me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you little Joe Rogan and to come </v>

300
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 3>from like your parents get murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My parents were crazy,</v>

301
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.390
<v Speaker 3>so and in the background your parents </v>
<v Speaker 3>get murdered in your wife and the images</v>

302
00:13:16.391 --> 00:13:19.900
<v Speaker 3>of Kung Fu or fucking streaming and on </v>
<v Speaker 3>your possible tyrants are going,</v>

303
00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:21.880
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to avenge us.</v>

304
00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 3>And there was a girl who had a</v>

305
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.260
<v Speaker 4>in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she had marks on her chest,</v>

306
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:31.280
<v Speaker 4>like she got scratched and the guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me see what it looks like.</v>

307
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:36.490
<v Speaker 4>And so of course she pulls her whole top</v>
<v Speaker 4>off and I just remember my mom saying </v>

308
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.030
<v Speaker 4>this because I was like fucking four </v>
<v Speaker 4>years old or something.</v>

309
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.600
<v Speaker 4>But I remember her going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She didn't have to take her.</v>

310
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:40.900
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

311
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.900
<v Speaker 3>Dot that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like she was mad at how preposterous it </v>

312
00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:51.541
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't have to take her shirt off </v>

313
00:13:51.541 --> 00:13:51.541
<v Speaker 3>that there was another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was another route.</v>

314
00:13:51.541 --> 00:13:52.090
<v Speaker 3>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was.</v>

315
00:13:52.091 --> 00:13:53.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was exploitative.</v>

316
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:56.070
<v Speaker 3>She could've just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>her being upset by that.</v>

317
00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.610
<v Speaker 3>And what did your dad go like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

318
00:13:57.611 --> 00:13:59.710
<v Speaker 3>let her finish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jennifer,</v>

319
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.320
<v Speaker 3>what was your mother?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think her real name is a Santa.</v>

320
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:04.450
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

321
00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:06.910
<v Speaker 3>but she didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she went by the name of Susan.</v>

322
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.340
<v Speaker 3>She and I have something in common </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't like it either.</v>

323
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.220
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>

324
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if.</v>

325
00:14:13.421 --> 00:14:15.010

<v Speaker 3>Some Italian name.</v>

326
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:20.310
<v Speaker 3>It does sound like an Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A slang for blind people does it there,</v>

327
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.550
<v Speaker 3>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't appreciate.</v>

328
00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.440
<v Speaker 3>There's got to be a lot of them.</v>

343
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.670
<v Speaker 5>they're behind on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on podcasts in terms of popularity.</v>

344

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:32.690
<v Speaker 5>He's legitimately funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we were texting one night I go,</v>

352
00:15:32.691 --> 00:15:33.590
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

353
00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:34.880
<v Speaker 5>he was going to vegas and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

354
00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:35.660
<v Speaker 5>if you need,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

355
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:39.260
<v Speaker 5>if you need a carrot top tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kill yourself.</v>

356
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:45.270
<v Speaker 5>And he wrote back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually I just found out that carrot </v>

357
00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:45.270
<v Speaker 5>top killed himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

358
00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:45.500
<v Speaker 5>and I wrote back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

359
00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:46.190
<v Speaker 5>that's a shame.</v>

360
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.430
<v Speaker 5>Kind of put on one hell of a show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Blake wrote back,</v>

361
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.130
<v Speaker 5>flake wrote back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I give them props,</v>

362
00:15:52.131 --> 00:15:55.040
<v Speaker 5>but the fucking guy used them all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like,</v>

363
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:59.720
<v Speaker 5>that's a pretty good joke for a 22 year </v>
<v Speaker 5>old dunk champion.</v>

364
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:05.020
<v Speaker 5>But that's maybe not even the best exit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's just a really funny dude and </v>

365
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:05.780
<v Speaker 5>incredibly nice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we had,</v>

366
00:16:05.781 --> 00:16:10.781
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we did a podcast in my house and he was </v>

367
00:16:10.781 --> 00:16:10.781
<v Speaker 5>drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He brought up,</v>

368
00:16:10.781 --> 00:16:15.610
<v Speaker 5>he had a bottle of water and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he finished that and then he refilled it</v>

369
00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:19.340
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the tap,</v>

370
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.390
<v Speaker 5>in my kitchen sink was used to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>locker room on it I guess.</v>

371
00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.700
<v Speaker 5>But it was just very like impressed by </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

372
00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:28.710
<v Speaker 5>how are you not a Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kept asking him,</v>

373
00:16:28.711 --> 00:16:31.850
<v Speaker 5>how are you known a Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he never told me no,</v>

374
00:16:31.851 --> 00:16:32.780
<v Speaker 5>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

375
00:16:32.781 --> 00:16:33.230
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

376
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.720
<v Speaker 5>he's got one car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he rents his house.</v>

377
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:40.750
<v Speaker 5>Like he's just a smart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of an interesting situation </v>

378
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.690
<v Speaker 5>with a lot of athletes is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>athletes that just did not nice people.</v>

379
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.210
<v Speaker 5>It's like part of getting good at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>sport means kind of.</v>

380
00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.670
<v Speaker 5>Well that's what we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>is being.</v>

381
00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.200
<v Speaker 5>And you could talk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we get,</v>

382
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:56.220
<v Speaker 5>this would actually be an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing because I would like to make a </v>

383
00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.700
<v Speaker 5>legit documentary about this competition</v>
<v Speaker 5>in America,</v>

384
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:00.410
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in that.</v>

385
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:03.950
<v Speaker 5>Because like coby Brian is too </v>
<v Speaker 5>competitive.</v>

386
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:07.130
<v Speaker 5>Michael Jordan is too competitive to the</v>
<v Speaker 5>point where it's like,</v>

387
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.550
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't look like I'm all for winning.</v>

388
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.770
<v Speaker 5>I'm all for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you clearly are something is there's</v>

389
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:19.830
<v Speaker 5>like a switch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was talking to another NBA player </v>

390
00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:23.471
<v Speaker 5>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's a big star and I won't say his </v>

391
00:17:23.471 --> 00:17:23.471
<v Speaker 5>name [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

392
00:17:23.471 --> 00:17:23.471
<v Speaker 5>I go man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And Colby is a,</v>

393
00:17:23.471 --> 00:17:24.110
<v Speaker 5>he's too competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

394
00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:24.620
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

395
00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:25.250
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's this,</v>

396
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.330
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get in the game.</v>

397
00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:27.500
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's too competitive.</v>

398
00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:28.400
<v Speaker 5>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

399
00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:30.830
<v Speaker 5>And tell them that all the time because </v>
<v Speaker 5>like he,</v>

400
00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:33.980
<v Speaker 5>it's like sort of weird to people when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

401
00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:36.860
<v Speaker 5>that how they get so good though.</v>

402
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.880
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mike,</v>

403
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.670
<v Speaker 5>Mike Koby Bryant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Michael Jordan,</v>

404
00:17:43.671 --> 00:17:46.880
<v Speaker 5>guys like that are Michael Jordan is an </v>
<v Speaker 5>incredible athlete.</v>

405
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:52.270
<v Speaker 5>And you pair that with this crazy spirit</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you get Michael Jordan.</v>

406
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:57.810
<v Speaker 5>But what I'm saying is at what point is </v>
<v Speaker 5>it too much?</v>

407
00:17:57.811 --> 00:18:01.260
<v Speaker 5>Where it's like you deal with mma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think about it in comedy,</v>

408
00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:04.140
<v Speaker 5>guys knocking each other out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

409
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:09.141
<v Speaker 5>what are we getting at?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because all every study of human </v>

410
00:18:09.141 --> 00:18:13.401
<v Speaker 5>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and particularly there's a lot of </v>

411
00:18:13.401 --> 00:18:15.141
<v Speaker 5>sociological studies coming out in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>last five to 10 years say that people </v>

412
00:18:15.141 --> 00:18:17.640
<v Speaker 5>don't get any happier beyond a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a financial point.</v>

413
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.100
<v Speaker 5>They don't get any happier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

414
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.930
<v Speaker 5>with possessions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>

415
00:18:21.931 --> 00:18:22.860
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>

416
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.440
<v Speaker 5>what are we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the point?</v>

417
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.740
<v Speaker 5>It's also now it's like cap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the first time in my life where </v>

418
00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.280
<v Speaker 5>I've ever thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>capitalism isn't so great.</v>

419
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.830
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where it's finally falling apart,</v>

420
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:35.520
<v Speaker 5>where you kind of go,</v>

421
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:36.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

422
00:18:36.831 --> 00:18:39.860
<v Speaker 1>let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's not perfect,</v>

423
00:18:39.861 --> 00:18:42.020
<v Speaker 1>but I think the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

424
00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:45.950
<v Speaker 1>you're working your merit and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to maneuver your way through the</v>

425
00:18:45.951 --> 00:18:50.000
<v Speaker 1>system counts up to something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more effort you put in,</v>

426
00:18:50.001 --> 00:18:55.001
<v Speaker 1>the more reward you get back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with the idea of capitalism and </v>

427
00:18:55.001 --> 00:18:55.460
<v Speaker 1>that went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you,</v>

428
00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.370
<v Speaker 1>when you get involved in the system that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have now with,</v>

429
00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.100
<v Speaker 1>with some just the stock market alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

430
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:06.490
<v Speaker 1>and trading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what did you short on this article </v>

431
00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:06.490
<v Speaker 1>the other day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was brilliant and he said,</v>

432
00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.130
<v Speaker 1>because I've had to tell people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't read it.</v>

433
00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:10.820
<v Speaker 1>It was in the Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York Times.</v>

434
00:19:10.821 --> 00:19:14.240
<v Speaker 1>He basically more above it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third wealthiest man in the world or</v>

435
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.810
<v Speaker 1>America says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard said,</v>

436
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:16.060
<v Speaker 1>fuck</v>

437
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.830
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

438
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:21.280
<v Speaker 5>He owns the company,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a five products in your house.</v>

439
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:23.710
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he basically said,</v>

440
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.150
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

441
00:19:25.151 --> 00:19:28.270
<v Speaker 5>I weed people rich people like me have </v>
<v Speaker 5>super rich,</v>

442
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.360
<v Speaker 5>don't get taxed enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We used to get tax way more.</v>

443
00:19:31.361 --> 00:19:32.410
<v Speaker 5>And I've had this argument,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

444
00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:37.440
<v Speaker 5>how Republicans thought,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we say a tax cuts lead to an improvement</v>

445
00:19:38.321 --> 00:19:39.430
<v Speaker 5>in the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

446
00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:44.520
<v Speaker 5>in the back of my head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've had this argument that a sacrament </v>

447
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.771
<v Speaker 5>with Vince Vaughn one time about that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people don't get into business if taxes </v>

448
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:54.300
<v Speaker 5>on doing standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're a 70 percent and not 40 percent.</v>

449
00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:58.630
<v Speaker 5>I would still do standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what I mean?</v>

450
00:19:58.631 --> 00:20:03.631
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing it for a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people start their own business </v>

451
00:20:03.701 --> 00:20:06.760
<v Speaker 5>because they don't like working for </v>
<v Speaker 5>other people and they,</v>

452
00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:11.840
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they have an idea that they want to </v>

453
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:14.880
<v Speaker 5>create by themselves and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 5>it comes down to I'm not going to do it </v>

454
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.820
<v Speaker 5>because taxes are too high.</v>

455
00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:19.300
<v Speaker 5>And Warren Buffett made that point that </v>
<v Speaker 5>capital gains tax,</v>

456
00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.550
<v Speaker 5>meaning gay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

457
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.250
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>taxes on money you make in profit on the</v>

458
00:20:24.251 --> 00:20:25.600
<v Speaker 5>stock market.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you make,</v>

459
00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:29.200
<v Speaker 5>if you invest 100 grand and then you </v>
<v Speaker 5>make 15 grand off of it,</v>

460
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.650
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will tax the 15 grand at.</v>

461
00:20:32.651 --> 00:20:37.030
<v Speaker 5>Now it's really low.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like 11 percent if that.</v>

462
00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:40.600
<v Speaker 5>And Warren Buffet said it used to be 29 </v>
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>

463
00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:44.360
<v Speaker 5>and everyone invested just as much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>

464
00:20:44.361 --> 00:20:48.360
<v Speaker 5>I reject the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we all liked this,</v>

465
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.760
<v Speaker 5>that taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that even socialism,</v>

466
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:56.080
<v Speaker 5>I think you would do the exact same shit</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a socialist country.</v>

467
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.980
<v Speaker 5>I think you would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they paid you to host fear factor and</v>

468
00:20:59.981 --> 00:21:01.930
<v Speaker 5>a podcast and news radio and all this </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

469
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.510
<v Speaker 5>If you did the same,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

470
00:21:04.511 --> 00:21:07.180
<v Speaker 5>if we all got paid relatively the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>amount of money,</v>

471
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:12.040
<v Speaker 5>I believe that I believe that I do what </v>
<v Speaker 5>I do because I'm compelled to do it,</v>

472
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:17.310
<v Speaker 5>not because of the money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm not saying everyone's an artist </v>

473
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.860
<v Speaker 5>or everyone's a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a comedian or whatever,</v>

474
00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:20.350
<v Speaker 5>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm of the mind that,</v>

475
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.150
<v Speaker 5>that people.</v>

476
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:23.290
<v Speaker 6>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

477
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:26.500
<v Speaker 6>you're almost advocating everyone </v>
<v Speaker 6>getting paid the same amount.</v>

478
00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:28.550
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

479
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:33.080
<v Speaker 5>Here's what I'm advocating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm advocating that the,</v>

480
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:36.880
<v Speaker 5>we live in a country where people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>art,</v>

481
00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:41.890
<v Speaker 5>people die because they're poor and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think a lot of Republicans or right wing</v>

482
00:21:42.411 --> 00:21:47.411
<v Speaker 5>people think that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the reason they're poor is because </v>

483
00:21:47.411 --> 00:21:49.640
<v Speaker 5>they didn't work hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's simply not the case.</v>

484
00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:52.940
<v Speaker 5>A lot of times I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot of people on the right are</v>

485
00:21:52.941 --> 00:21:55.400
<v Speaker 5>born on third base and think they hit a </v>
<v Speaker 5>triple.</v>

486
00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.290
<v Speaker 5>You're born into this career.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

487
00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.170
<v Speaker 5>That's an old phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yet it's,</v>

488
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:05.200
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're born into this life and then you </v>

489
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.811
<v Speaker 5>go because you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like when Barbara Bush said during </v>

490
00:22:07.811 --> 00:22:07.970
<v Speaker 5>Katrina,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hurricane Katrina,</v>

491
00:22:07.971 --> 00:22:11.150
<v Speaker 5>she goes about the people in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>superdome.</v>

492
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.400
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some of those people have never lived so</v>

493
00:22:13.401 --> 00:22:18.401
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you fucking cunt for you to </v>

494
00:22:18.401 --> 00:22:18.401
<v Speaker 5>say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She actually said that.</v>

495
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.930
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

496
00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.840
<v Speaker 5>so the idea that people will,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

497
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:26.870
<v Speaker 5>they just believe that people in rich </v>
<v Speaker 5>white people couldn't believe that there</v>

498
00:22:27.261 --> 00:22:31.370
<v Speaker 5>were people in America that didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 5>cars when they said they would go,</v>

499
00:22:31.371 --> 00:22:36.371
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the mayor told them to get out of town </v>

500
00:22:36.371 --> 00:22:36.371
<v Speaker 5>and drive out into town and they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

501
00:22:36.371 --> 00:22:37.580
<v Speaker 5>they didn't have cars and there were no </v>
<v Speaker 5>buses.</v>

502
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:40.550
<v Speaker 5>The buses stopped at a certain point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

503
00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.220
<v Speaker 5>so just the idea that people are dying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

504
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:45.830
<v Speaker 5>and then we get into this thing of like </v>
<v Speaker 5>American's best isn't,</v>

505
00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot.</v>

506
00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:50.740
<v Speaker 5>Most of the people that say America's </v>
<v Speaker 5>best system in the world don't know what</v>

507
00:22:50.741 --> 00:22:53.870
<v Speaker 5>the other systems and also the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 5>like socialized medicine.</v>

508
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.970
<v Speaker 6>Why wouldn't you want to help save </v>
<v Speaker 6>people's lives like I,</v>

509
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:03.100
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the idea behind it is that it </v>

510
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:03.570
<v Speaker 6>doesn't encourage competition amongst </v>
<v Speaker 6>doctors,</v>

511
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:04.980
<v Speaker 6>doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So doctors,</v>

512
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.170
<v Speaker 6>if they're only going to get paid a </v>
<v Speaker 6>certain amount of money,</v>

513
00:23:07.171 --> 00:23:10.170
<v Speaker 6>no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have no incentive to be excellent.</v>

514
00:23:10.171 --> 00:23:14.460
<v Speaker 6>But that goes back to my point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think most people that are doctors are</v>

515
00:23:14.461 --> 00:23:18.690
<v Speaker 6>compelled to be Dr,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think it's either or.</v>

516
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.440
<v Speaker 6>You don't think that a doctor is </v>
<v Speaker 6>compelled to be a doctor.</v>

517
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:26.460
<v Speaker 6>He enjoys it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but works even harder because he gets </v>

518
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.310
<v Speaker 6>financial compensation for his work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think personally,</v>

519
00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.300
<v Speaker 6>I personally</v>

520
00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:34.350
<v Speaker 5>don't because I think that people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are driven are not driven by a financial</v>

521
00:23:36.291 --> 00:23:36.500
<v Speaker 5>renew.</v>

522
00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:41.650
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you don't think it enhances things </v>

523
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:43.511
<v Speaker 6>is even if they're not driven by it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even if they would be doing it happily </v>

524
00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:45.050
<v Speaker 6>for a peasant's wage because they love </v>
<v Speaker 6>the art,</v>

525
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck they're doing,</v>

526
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.880
<v Speaker 4>you don't think that it makes them </v>
<v Speaker 4>really push it and have it sometimes and</v>

527
00:23:49.881 --> 00:23:52.200
<v Speaker 4>not slack off when there's money on </v>
<v Speaker 4>online?</v>

528
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.690
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

529
00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.400
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

530
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.110
<v Speaker 4>to give people money makes me have </v>
<v Speaker 4>productive.</v>

531
00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.130
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

532
00:23:59.131 --> 00:24:04.131
<v Speaker 5>But I guess the point is why are we so </v>
<v Speaker 5>compelled to be productive?</v>

533
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.300
<v Speaker 5>It's like where they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they go,</v>

534
00:24:06.301 --> 00:24:11.301
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>France fucking only works 35 hour work </v>

535
00:24:11.301 --> 00:24:11.400
<v Speaker 5>week and we get an image in our head of </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

536
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.860
<v Speaker 4>that's faggy a 35 hour work week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you affect it?</v>

537
00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:20.861
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're having a good life like we </v>

538
00:24:20.861 --> 00:24:23.331
<v Speaker 4>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we've these systems and the images </v>

539
00:24:23.331 --> 00:24:25.901
<v Speaker 4>and the and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cultural norms are such an America </v>

540
00:24:25.901 --> 00:24:28.961
<v Speaker 4>that we just go with fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't be caught dead only working </v>

541
00:24:28.961 --> 00:24:29.300
<v Speaker 4>30 about why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why,</v>

542
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.350
<v Speaker 4>why do you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

543
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:35.380
<v Speaker 4>Why do we all have this need to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to fucking work and I got to </v>

544
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.081
<v Speaker 4>generate and I got to make fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to trick people into wanting to </v>

545
00:24:38.081 --> 00:24:42.431
<v Speaker 4>buy shit that I'm doing so that I can </v>
<v Speaker 4>get money and then buy shit that I had </v>

546
00:24:42.431 --> 00:24:43.890
<v Speaker 4>been tricked into that I don't need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need any of this.</v>

547
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:48.950
<v Speaker 4>This is a song that I've been bouncing </v>
<v Speaker 4>around forever and my conclusion and I </v>

548
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:54.100
<v Speaker 4>don't have a real conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I always believe is that it </v>

549
00:24:54.801 --> 00:24:58.970
<v Speaker 4>seems that everything in nature operates</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some sort of a natural system that we</v>

550
00:24:58.971 --> 00:24:59.510
<v Speaker 4>accept.</v>

551
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.020
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's salmon going up river,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's bizarre things,</v>

552
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:08.021
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going up river and throwing </v>

553
00:25:08.021 --> 00:25:08.021
<v Speaker 4>themselves on the rocks and it happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>every year.</v>

554
00:25:08.021 --> 00:25:10.370
<v Speaker 4>It's just a cycle and it's put in place </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a reason.</v>

555
00:25:10.371 --> 00:25:12.780
<v Speaker 4>It's put in place to make sure that only</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad motherfucker,</v>

556
00:25:12.781 --> 00:25:17.781
<v Speaker 4>salmon get to breed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to be the baddest </v>

557
00:25:17.781 --> 00:25:20.741
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker to make it up that river.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that is the same thing </v>

558
00:25:20.741 --> 00:25:25.391
<v Speaker 4>with human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we are a part of a natural </v>

559
00:25:25.391 --> 00:25:28.241
<v Speaker 4>system too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're the apex of the natural </v>

560
00:25:28.241 --> 00:25:29.330
<v Speaker 4>systems and we're so super complex that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't even understand our motivations</v>

561
00:25:29.331 --> 00:25:34.331
<v Speaker 4>for things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't understand that this drive and </v>

562
00:25:34.331 --> 00:25:34.331
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

563
00:25:34.331 --> 00:25:37.100
<v Speaker 4>all our ideas of personal gain really </v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't about personal gain.</v>

564
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:42.130
<v Speaker 4>It's about enhancing the amount of money</v>
<v Speaker 4>that goes into this system that makes </v>

565
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:42.370
<v Speaker 4>things and innovate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

566
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:47.590
<v Speaker 4>That's what it really is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has nothing to do with you or I all </v>

567
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:51.101
<v Speaker 4>of our wants and needs and loves for </v>
<v Speaker 4>material possessions and all the things </v>

568
00:25:51.101 --> 00:25:54.401
<v Speaker 4>that comes with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those that all that is doing is somehow </v>

569
00:25:54.401 --> 00:25:55.040
<v Speaker 4>or another pushing innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pushing you.</v>

570
00:25:55.041 --> 00:25:59.210
<v Speaker 4>Keeping up with the Jones' is pushing </v>
<v Speaker 4>some sort of a technological singularity</v>

571
00:25:59.211 --> 00:26:01.260
<v Speaker 4>that we're pushing towards said</v>

572
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.350
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do we not attended?</v>

573
00:26:04.351 --> 00:26:08.190
<v Speaker 5>We just let it is I guess on </v>
<v Speaker 5>productivity as this,</v>

574
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.760
<v Speaker 5>as this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as this high high.</v>

575
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.260
<v Speaker 5>That's the ultimate goal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just seems like no,</v>

576
00:26:14.261 --> 00:26:17.430
<v Speaker 5>it is ridiculous for the fucking people </v>
<v Speaker 5>who own the company,</v>

577
00:26:17.431 --> 00:26:19.260
<v Speaker 5>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's middle.</v>

578
00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:24.290
<v Speaker 5>Like the middle class is gone now </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's because we've all been </v>

579
00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:28.011
<v Speaker 5>tricked into thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like these people that provide jobs are </v>

580
00:26:28.011 --> 00:26:31.000
<v Speaker 5>these fucking messiahs the particularly </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the last year and a half of like,</v>

581
00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.480
<v Speaker 5>what about the jobs?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about the jobs so that they go,</v>

582
00:26:33.481 --> 00:26:34.890
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't want to hurt.</v>

583
00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:38.220
<v Speaker 5>We don't want to tax people like Warren </v>
<v Speaker 5>Buffet because they provide jobs.</v>

584
00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:43.340
<v Speaker 5>Actually most jobs in America,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think 60 percent of America are from </v>

585
00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:43.340
<v Speaker 5>small businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

586
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:49.130
<v Speaker 5>now having.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I guess it's just the idea of in </v>

587
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:52.140
<v Speaker 5>they're starting to study like a gross </v>
<v Speaker 5>national happiness.</v>

588
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:54.700
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>

589
00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:59.790
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of it is not contingent upon </v>

590
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.790
<v Speaker 5>capitalism and productivity and I.</v>

591
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:07.790
<v Speaker 5>because now I feel like people are so </v>
<v Speaker 5>drunk on productivity and getting these </v>

592
00:27:08.281 --> 00:27:11.610
<v Speaker 5>possessions that they are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have less time for the kids.</v>

593
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.060
<v Speaker 5>They get to work two jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they got an.</v>

594
00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:20.080
<v Speaker 5>It just seems like it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just seems like we're at a breaking </v>

595
00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:20.490
<v Speaker 5>point in terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

596
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.320
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it'll happen,</v>

597
00:27:22.321 --> 00:27:27.321
<v Speaker 5>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish there was some amount of </v>

598
00:27:27.321 --> 00:27:27.760
<v Speaker 5>consideration from people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

599
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:28.320
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

600
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.870
<v Speaker 5>and having said that I enjoy a hard </v>
<v Speaker 5>day's work.</v>

601
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.960
<v Speaker 5>I enjoy like him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what I like about it is I like the </v>

602
00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.410
<v Speaker 5>personal interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I've always loved about work</v>

603
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:41.550
<v Speaker 5>is the personal connection you have with</v>
<v Speaker 5>people and like feeling like we're doing</v>

604
00:27:41.551 --> 00:27:43.920
<v Speaker 5>this thing together that I'm completely </v>
<v Speaker 5>for,</v>

605
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.830
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

606
00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:50.860
<v Speaker 5>it's like the money part I just find not</v>
<v Speaker 5>negligible because I think it's </v>

607
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.140
<v Speaker 5>important to make a living all that </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

608
00:27:52.141 --> 00:27:53.970
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just feel like there's too much of</v>

609
00:27:53.971 --> 00:27:58.971
<v Speaker 5>a premium put on productivity and </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting pregnant.</v>

610
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.210
<v Speaker 1>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>

611
00:28:01.211 --> 00:28:04.060
<v Speaker 1>I love having an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love having a laptop.</v>

612
00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked being able to go buy a </v>

613
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 1>cellphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

614
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.991
<v Speaker 1>I love being able to get a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not making any of these things and </v>

615
00:28:12.991 --> 00:28:12.991
<v Speaker 1>neither are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

616
00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:15.760
<v Speaker 1>You don't know to live this life this </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

617
00:28:15.761 --> 00:28:18.620
<v Speaker 1>We need somebody to make shit and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

618
00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.350
<v Speaker 1>no one's saying that should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

619
00:28:20.351 --> 00:28:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

620
00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.970
<v Speaker 5>that doesn't necessarily preclude that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It couldn't have happened in another,</v>

621
00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.570
<v Speaker 5>in another financial system or arc or </v>
<v Speaker 5>like as,</v>

622
00:28:28.571 --> 00:28:30.550
<v Speaker 5>as the guy on the Internet the other day</v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

623
00:28:30.551 --> 00:28:34.000
<v Speaker 5>a felonious monk is the guy's name,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he put up,</v>

624
00:28:34.001 --> 00:28:35.470
<v Speaker 5>posted a youtube video that got a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 5>love.</v>

625
00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.180
<v Speaker 5>He said a black dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

626
00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:41.080
<v Speaker 5>how can you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how am I going to say that capitalism is</v>

627
00:28:41.081 --> 00:28:46.081
<v Speaker 5>the best system in the world when we owe</v>
<v Speaker 5>billions of dollars to a communist </v>

628
00:28:46.081 --> 00:28:46.540
<v Speaker 5>country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

629
00:28:46.541 --> 00:28:47.780
<v Speaker 5>We just like [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>America is like,</v>

630
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.750
<v Speaker 5>this is best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

631
00:28:49.751 --> 00:28:50.680
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why don't we eat.</v>

632
00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:54.550
<v Speaker 5>Their system is clearly beating as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>communist.</v>

633
00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:56.490
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're there.</v>

634
00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.900
<v Speaker 5>It's like a communist with a soft </v>
<v Speaker 5>capitalism.</v>

635
00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:03.030
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know how you described the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Chinese Chinese a financial.</v>

636
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about our financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>system to even comment on it and when I </v>

637
00:29:08.431 --> 00:29:11.560
<v Speaker 1>say things I'm usually wrong as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>like numbers and.</v>

638
00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:12.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

639
00:29:12.191 --> 00:29:17.191
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about all this shit is </v>

640
00:29:17.191 --> 00:29:17.191
<v Speaker 1>no one under all the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know.</v>

641
00:29:17.191 --> 00:29:18.480
<v Speaker 1>They know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That fucking.</v>

642
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.880
<v Speaker 1>What's his name guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ponzi scheme guy.</v>

643
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.410
<v Speaker 1>What's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie madoff already made off.</v>

644
00:29:22.411 --> 00:29:27.411
<v Speaker 1>It would never been able to get away </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that if they all knew that that is </v>

645
00:29:27.411 --> 00:29:30.231
<v Speaker 1>the best proof of this is some crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking get.</v>

646
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.370
<v Speaker 1>So when people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people go,</v>

647
00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:37.371
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that we should have done </v>

648
00:29:37.371 --> 00:29:37.371
<v Speaker 1>the bailout and why don't think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

649
00:29:37.371 --> 00:29:37.371
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

650
00:29:37.371 --> 00:29:42.050
<v Speaker 5>In a perfect world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Matt Taibbi wrote a book called Grip </v>

651
00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:42.940
<v Speaker 5>Toby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is fucking excellent book.</v>

652
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.310
<v Speaker 5>I love that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A.</v>

653
00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:46.300
<v Speaker 5>The book is really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really good.</v>

654
00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.060
<v Speaker 5>I love the rolling stone articles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was the guy who.</v>

655
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:51.970
<v Speaker 5>He broke the Goldman Sachs article </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he was on.</v>

656
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.610
<v Speaker 5>How is he still alive?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

657
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:58.650
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's proof that there is no </v>

658
00:29:58.650 --> 00:29:58.650
<v Speaker 5>illuminati.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you needed any more for,</v>

659
00:29:58.650 --> 00:29:59.820
<v Speaker 5>but that's the only shred of proof,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that mentality.</v>

660
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.240
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

661
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.500
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

662
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:07.680
<v Speaker 5>the he was on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was in the press pool on I believe </v>

663
00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.341
<v Speaker 5>Obama's or Mccain's campaign for </v>
<v Speaker 5>president and they were all talking </v>

664
00:30:12.941 --> 00:30:14.390
<v Speaker 5>about the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

665
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:16.860
<v Speaker 5>the bailout and the all that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

666
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:21.870
<v Speaker 5>the tarp and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was with all the correspondence </v>

667
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:22.000
<v Speaker 5>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does any,</v>

668
00:30:22.001 --> 00:30:26.620
<v Speaker 5>do any of us know what top is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And none of them did.</v>

669
00:30:26.621 --> 00:30:30.190
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to study,</v>

670
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:35.220
<v Speaker 5>I have to write about this shit because </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're the ones who are supposed to know </v>

671
00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.100
<v Speaker 5>and we don't fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he said,</v>

672
00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:41.370
<v Speaker 5>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the amount of work it takes to even </v>

673
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:41.370
<v Speaker 5>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

674
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:41.370
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

675
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:43.510
<v Speaker 5>it was pitifully boring,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

676
00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.540
<v Speaker 5>how much shit he had to do to even begin</v>
<v Speaker 5>to understand it.</v>

677
00:30:46.541 --> 00:30:48.220
<v Speaker 5>And his point about tea party people </v>
<v Speaker 5>was,</v>

678
00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:53.470
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they long for is simplicity.</v>

679
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:56.410
<v Speaker 5>And that shit is over some financials.</v>

680
00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:02.060
<v Speaker 6>It's not just financial simplicity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think the whole idea of calling </v>

681
00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:02.250
<v Speaker 6>themselves the tea party,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean they,</v>

682
00:31:02.251 --> 00:31:03.360
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they are actually,</v>

683
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:08.130
<v Speaker 6>they're reinvigorating memories of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>original Boston Tea Party.</v>

684
00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:09.330
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>absolutely.</v>

685
00:31:09.331 --> 00:31:10.800
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but having said that,</v>

686
00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:15.910
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Boston tea party was about taxation </v>

687
00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.791
<v Speaker 5>without representation and this is about</v>
<v Speaker 5>complex financial instruments and the </v>

688
00:31:18.801 --> 00:31:23.150
<v Speaker 5>interconnectivity of the global </v>
<v Speaker 5>financial system.</v>

689
00:31:23.151 --> 00:31:26.130
<v Speaker 5>It's like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't know what a fucking uh,</v>

690
00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:29.780
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>reverse mortgage,</v>

691
00:31:29.781 --> 00:31:30.200
<v Speaker 5>all that shit</v>

692
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:32.470
<v Speaker 6>that you just go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the fuck.</v>

693
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:35.290
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a relatively intelligent guy.</v>

694
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:40.620
<v Speaker 6>I have and my dad was a tax attorney.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't understand any of this shit.</v>

695
00:31:40.681 --> 00:31:44.440
<v Speaker 6>And you try to look at like leveraged </v>
<v Speaker 6>mortgage and shorting.</v>

696
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:45.710
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You look at talent.</v>

697
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.190
<v Speaker 6>Try to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

698
00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.570
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shorting.</v>

699
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:50.960
<v Speaker 6>I could explain relatively [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

700
00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:51.850
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the,</v>

701
00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:56.860
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what about that dude that shorted the </v>

702
00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:58.801
<v Speaker 6>economy that there was some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some gigantic wage have made that the </v>

703
00:31:58.801 --> 00:32:03.601
<v Speaker 6>economy that are American economy's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to lose its AAA standard or </v>

704
00:32:03.601 --> 00:32:04.420
<v Speaker 6>whatever it be making millions of </v>
<v Speaker 6>dollars.</v>

705
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:09.600
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some guy made a fuckload of money when </v>

706
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:09.600
<v Speaker 6>our credit rating dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

707
00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.510
<v Speaker 6>that is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But again,</v>

708
00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.880
<v Speaker 6>you wouldn't even try to explain that to</v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody in the tea party.</v>

709
00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.820
<v Speaker 6>Try to explain that to a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>intelligent person.</v>

710
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:19.740
<v Speaker 6>Try.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Explain.</v>

711
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:20.780
<v Speaker 6>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so yeah,</v>

712
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.260
<v Speaker 6>so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they're trying to.</v>

713
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:22.540
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

714
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.720
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

715
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:27.310
<v Speaker 5>they long for this simplicity of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

716
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.530
<v Speaker 5>I believe that there should you believe </v>
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>

717
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.420
<v Speaker 5>in corporate socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're like,</v>

718
00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:35.120
<v Speaker 5>fuck you if you're dying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if a corporation is even as like a,</v>

719
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:40.400
<v Speaker 5>a graze,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a flesh wound here comes everyone </v>

720
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.830
<v Speaker 5>to like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we got to help the corporations because </v>

721
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.411
<v Speaker 5>they provide jobs like you motherfuckers</v>
<v Speaker 5>are buying into this thing of it's the </v>

722
00:32:47.411 --> 00:32:48.800
<v Speaker 5>deification of corporations.</v>

723
00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:51.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ever watched that documentary,</v>

724
00:32:51.251 --> 00:32:52.240
<v Speaker 1>the corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

725
00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an amazing piece of work.</v>

726
00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:59.490
<v Speaker 1>It really gets you thinking of how the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually set up and the way it's </v>

727
00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:01.630
<v Speaker 1>set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one feels like they're doing anything</v>

728
00:33:01.631 --> 00:33:03.700
<v Speaker 1>badly even though bad things are getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>done</v>

729
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:07.980
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't be a corporation without being</v>

730
00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.190
<v Speaker 5>fucking dastardly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You eat.</v>

731
00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:12.210
<v Speaker 5>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way the system instead of,</v>

732
00:33:12.211 --> 00:33:13.620
<v Speaker 5>and this goes back to my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>

733
00:33:13.621 --> 00:33:15.300
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my capitalism argument,</v>

734
00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:20.480
<v Speaker 5>the way the system is set up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if these corporations profits don't </v>

735
00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.270
<v Speaker 5>increase every 12 weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their stock price goes down.</v>

736
00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:29.690
<v Speaker 5>So how do you make profits increase?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Either fucking expand your market or cut</v>

737
00:33:31.261 --> 00:33:32.500
<v Speaker 5>workers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>

738
00:33:32.501 --> 00:33:37.501
<v Speaker 5>So they cut orders is a fucked up thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>to do and expanding markets is a pretty </v>

739
00:33:37.921 --> 00:33:40.620
<v Speaker 5>dastardly business to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>

740
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:44.070
<v Speaker 5>So they're not the only way you survive </v>
<v Speaker 5>in these.</v>

741
00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.550
<v Speaker 5>I remember when me and a Chappelle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're having stuff with,</v>

742
00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.390
<v Speaker 5>with comedy central,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of stuff and I go get that.</v>

743
00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:54.060
<v Speaker 5>That's not their viacom for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they're just,</v>

744
00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.580
<v Speaker 5>that's what they fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they who,</v>

745
00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.680
<v Speaker 5>how can we get there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're hungry machines that are built </v>

746
00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.220
<v Speaker 5>to hoard money and fuck people over.</v>

747
00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get into negotiations with </v>

748
00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:10.850
<v Speaker 1>anyone about anything and you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>really realizing,</v>

749
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.590
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where it is.</v>

750
00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.870
<v Speaker 1>How was your a fear factor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Negotiation was.</v>

751
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.610
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was easy.</v>

752
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:20.040
<v Speaker 1>It was easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were nice,</v>

753
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:23.880
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well luckily I did it for 148 episodes,</v>

754
00:34:23.881 --> 00:34:28.881
<v Speaker 1>so they knew I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know I was going to have to </v>

755
00:34:28.881 --> 00:34:33.861
<v Speaker 1>audition for it and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better not make me audition for our </v>

756
00:34:33.861 --> 00:34:33.861
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>

757
00:34:33.861 --> 00:34:35.700
<v Speaker 1>They were always kind of weird with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>show because it did so good.</v>

758
00:34:35.701 --> 00:34:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Like I think it stayed on NBC website </v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole time.</v>

759
00:34:38.521 --> 00:34:41.070
<v Speaker 1>It was off the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could still go to the show page</v>

760
00:34:41.071 --> 00:34:44.190
<v Speaker 1>for fear factor and it was kind of odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the only show that you could do</v>

761
00:34:44.191 --> 00:34:45.070
<v Speaker 1>that with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

762
00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:50.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was ever officially </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancel and I think we just stopped </v>

763
00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:50.150
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was weird because it never liked.</v>

764
00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Got horrible ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all die off a little bit,</v>

765
00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.040
<v Speaker 1>but it never had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never was horrible.</v>

766
00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.620
<v Speaker 1>It was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had done a syndicated version.</v>

767
00:34:58.621 --> 00:35:00.870
<v Speaker 1>Are you guys 148 was enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>syndicate.</v>

768
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was 100 more than enough syndicates.</v>

769
00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:04.320
<v Speaker 1>They syndicates most shows at 100.</v>

770
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:05.200
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

771
00:35:05.201 --> 00:35:10.201
<v Speaker 5>But I'm saying did you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's like a who wants to be a </v>

772
00:35:10.201 --> 00:35:10.201
<v Speaker 5>millionaire?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they,</v>

773
00:35:10.201 --> 00:35:10.210
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

774
00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:15.240
<v Speaker 5>they stripped it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stopped doing it prime time and then </v>

775
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:15.240
<v Speaker 5>they did they ever.</v>

776
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:15.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

777
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:15.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do that.</v>

778
00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Well that would be the budget of fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor is really high when you factor in</v>

779
00:35:20.621 --> 00:35:25.621
<v Speaker 1>some of the crazy fucking stents these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have to do and they're big this </v>

780
00:35:25.621 --> 00:35:25.621
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

781
00:35:25.621 --> 00:35:30.360
<v Speaker 1>There's some nutty shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These fucking people have to do like </v>

<v Speaker 1>some real real like were you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can't describe any of them.</v>

785
00:35:35.591 --> 00:35:37.470
<v Speaker 1>It would be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a breach contract,</v>

786
00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 1>but it's</v>

787
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:43.040
<v Speaker 6>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the stents are bigger and crazier </v>

788
00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:43.040
<v Speaker 6>than we've ever done it before.</v>

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:43.040
<v Speaker 3>You were ahead of your time jail by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

790
00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:47.300

<v Speaker 3>makeup on any time you go on TV shows or</v>

791
00:35:47.301 --> 00:35:52.301
<v Speaker 3>if you're on shows and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's always been the person where they </v>

792
00:35:52.301 --> 00:35:52.301
<v Speaker 3>have to make a person come and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

793
00:35:52.301 --> 00:35:52.460
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want any.</v>

794
00:35:52.461 --> 00:35:53.710
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we're just going to give it up.</v>

795
00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.560
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want any.</v>

796
00:35:54.561 --> 00:35:59.561
<v Speaker 3>You never get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching a show the other day </v>

797

<v Speaker 3>where you can now with the hd,</v>

798
00:35:59.561 --> 00:36:02.990
<v Speaker 3>you could see the makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bad makeup jobs on all these people,</v>

799
00:36:02.991 --> 00:36:05.090
<v Speaker 3>and now I'm just imagining you with rosy</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheeks.</v>

800
00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You had a skin thing though,</v>

801
00:36:07.431 --> 00:36:09.830
<v Speaker 6>didn't you have the little Lego?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can see it on my knuckles.</v>

802
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:11.900
<v Speaker 6>You had it on your face that would </v>
<v Speaker 6>periods correct.</v>

803
00:36:11.901 --> 00:36:12.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it goes away.</v>

804
00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.010
<v Speaker 6>There's a stuff called protopic ointment</v>
<v Speaker 6>as long as you catch it,</v>

805
00:36:16.011 --> 00:36:18.200
<v Speaker 6>like right as it's coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can get it to go away,</v>

806
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:23.570
<v Speaker 6>but you've got to be real diligent about</v>
<v Speaker 6>your vitamins and stuff like that and </v>

807
00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:23.750

813
00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:37.760
<v Speaker 6>you were saying that there's basically </v>
<v Speaker 6>no side effects,</v>

814
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:39.500
<v Speaker 6>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not say there's no sound.</v>

815
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:44.150
<v Speaker 6>It's relatively safe if you're doiNg it </v>
<v Speaker 6>under a doctor's supervision.</v>

816
00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:45.020
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're smart about it.</v>

817
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:46.970
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and my buddy texted me and said,</v>

818
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:48.560
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what about,</v>

819
00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:54.130
<v Speaker 6>what about like cancerous cells?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It will accelerate the growth of any </v>

820
00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:54.380
<v Speaker 6>kind of self.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no evidence,</v>

821
00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:56.720
<v Speaker 6>there's no evidence that it supports </v>
<v Speaker 6>cancer growth,</v>

822
00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:02.050
<v Speaker 6>but there is evidence that if your </v>
<v Speaker 6>body's immune system's down and you're </v>

823
00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:02.990
<v Speaker 6>not healthy than cancer can grow in your</v>
<v Speaker 6>bodies easier,</v>

824
00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:08.430
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you have your overall system is </v>

825
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.200
<v Speaker 6>operating more efficiently because of </v>
<v Speaker 6>hormones that you've introduced to it or</v>

826
00:37:09.201 --> 00:37:13.190
<v Speaker 6>because of vitamins and supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if your system is working better,</v>

827
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.080
<v Speaker 6>you're going to be able to fight things </v>
<v Speaker 6>off better.</v>

828
00:37:15.081 --> 00:37:20.081
<v Speaker 6>It's really that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you take a holistic approach to the </v>

829
00:37:20.081 --> 00:37:20.081
<v Speaker 6>human body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

830
00:37:20.081 --> 00:37:20.170
<v Speaker 6>cancer is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very,</v>

831
00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:25.171
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>tricky mystery of the human body as to </v>

832
00:37:25.171 --> 00:37:27.971
<v Speaker 6>why it exists in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But a lot of people believe that </v>

833
00:37:27.971 --> 00:37:29.930
<v Speaker 6>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 6>any ailment that at least part of it has</v>

834
00:37:29.931 --> 00:37:33.800
<v Speaker 6>to do with how you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what kind of energy you have,</v>

835
00:37:33.801 --> 00:37:36.470
<v Speaker 6>how much work you have to put in every </v>
<v Speaker 6>day.</v>

836
00:37:36.471 --> 00:37:41.471
<v Speaker 6>How happy are you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the idea is how much does the whole </v>

837
00:37:41.471 --> 00:37:45.150
<v Speaker 6>system are you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How much money did you make last </v>

838
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:48.461
<v Speaker 6>quarter?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That doesn't protect you from cancer </v>

839
00:37:48.461 --> 00:37:48.461
<v Speaker 6>fella.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wait,</v>

840
00:37:48.461 --> 00:37:49.520
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's what they would have.</v>

841
00:37:49.521 --> 00:37:52.440
<v Speaker 6>You believe that if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who are these day,</v>

842
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:57.720
<v Speaker 6>I believe the exist in that world needed</v>
<v Speaker 6>to be an artist.</v>

843
00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:02.880
<v Speaker 6>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like rejecting yourself in the </v>

844
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.350
<v Speaker 6>proletariat to know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I see people.</v>

845
00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.860
<v Speaker 6>nobody's more proletariat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then the kid,</v>

846
00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:10.280
<v Speaker 6>the kid proletarian and he calls himself</v>
<v Speaker 6>the kid.</v>

847
00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.330
<v Speaker 6>I liked to hang out with that guy.</v>

848
00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:12.740
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

849
00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.170
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

850
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:18.680
<v Speaker 5>I just think it's fucking disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think when people are,</v>

851
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.320
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it goes back to that you can be anything</v>

852
00:38:21.321 --> 00:38:24.260
<v Speaker 5>in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can be anything in this country.</v>

853
00:38:24.261 --> 00:38:25.490
<v Speaker 5>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's never.</v>

854
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.250
<v Speaker 5>You never hear it from when people go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

855
00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.660
<v Speaker 5>you can be in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Having said that,</v>

856
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.120
<v Speaker 5>if you're white,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're born into a,</v>

857
00:38:32.121 --> 00:38:35.650
<v Speaker 5>into a upper middle class white people </v>
<v Speaker 5>or above,</v>

858
00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:39.370
<v Speaker 5>it's way easier to be anything which </v>
<v Speaker 5>they never said.</v>

859
00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:44.420
<v Speaker 4>What's an unknown saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a level playing field and it's </v>

860
00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:44.420
<v Speaker 4>impossible to make it level.</v>

861
00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:45.620
<v Speaker 5>They'Re is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree,</v>

862
00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:50.680
<v Speaker 5>but they're implying that it's level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that the people on the upper </v>

863
00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.830
<v Speaker 5>crust believed that it's level goes bY,</v>

864
00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:57.910
<v Speaker 4>did anybody believes it's level,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do think that they think it's a </v>

865
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:58.400
<v Speaker 4>better setup than India.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think.</v>

866
00:38:58.401 --> 00:39:03.401
<v Speaker 4>I think they believe that people here </v>
<v Speaker 4>have more of a shot at living a real </v>

867
00:39:03.401 --> 00:39:03.401
<v Speaker 4>life than France.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

868
00:39:03.401 --> 00:39:04.880
<v Speaker 4>there's people that have these ideals,</v>

869
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:10.150
<v Speaker 5>but you know what America is ranked in </v>
<v Speaker 5>terms of class a jumping in the world.</v>

870
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.800
<v Speaker 5>14th.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

871
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:17.480
<v Speaker 5>Who's the number one who just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>around eight might be India.</v>

872
00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:18.890
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

873
00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:19.650
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

874
00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:22.130
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

875
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:24.230
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's the uk.</v>

876
00:39:24.231 --> 00:39:26.180
<v Speaker 5>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think or it might be Germany,</v>

877
00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.190
<v Speaker 5>Germany has got a really good economy </v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

878
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:30.690
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in terms of like the german,</v>

879
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:35.770
<v Speaker 5>he was in the shitter right now to now </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're the only ones that's not really </v>

880
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:35.770
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

881
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:36.440
<v Speaker 5>they've done better than anybody.</v>

882
00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.860
<v Speaker 4>Some reason when we were over in Germany</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing a show,</v>

883
00:39:38.861 --> 00:39:41.860
<v Speaker 4>that's what our driver was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he was just a whiner.</v>

884
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:44.200
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

885
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.900
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

886
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:47.330
<v Speaker 5>so the idea that America is the best you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can jump.</v>

887
00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.380
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

888
00:39:48.381 --> 00:39:51.010
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's 14th in the world out of $200,</v>

889
00:39:51.011 --> 00:39:54.170
<v Speaker 5>which again is we made good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in terms of if you ask people,</v>

890
00:39:54.171 --> 00:39:55.670
<v Speaker 5>they'd all go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're number one.</v>

891
00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:57.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know why we're number one?</v>

892
00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.090
<v Speaker 4>Because we had leonard's cantered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We make muscle cars.</v>

893
00:40:00.091 --> 00:40:03.630
<v Speaker 4>We have some of the fucking best shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We designed some of the best shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fucking van halen.</v>

895
00:40:05.781 --> 00:40:08.250
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason why we have the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedians.</v>

896
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:13.280
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason why that's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though there's some good ones from </v>

897
00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:13.830
<v Speaker 4>other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a fact.</v>

898
00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:17.300
<v Speaker 5>Give us number one on shit that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>deserve,</v>

899
00:40:17.330 --> 00:40:20.190
<v Speaker 5>that we're actually number one on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're not number when people are.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You can be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's of.</v>

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:24.890
<v Speaker 4>We don't have all the best bands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we got most of them.</v>

902
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.970
<v Speaker 4>Let's be realistic.</v>

903

<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's</v>

932
00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:44.520
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a pretty easy,</v>

933
00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.640
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like pretty low hanging fruit to be</v>

934
00:41:47.641 --> 00:41:49.200
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm support the troops.</v>

935
00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:54.360
<v Speaker 4>It's so silly and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like he's positioning </v>

936
00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.800
<v Speaker 4>himself to be a cheerleader.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>cheerlead a guarantee.</v>

<v Speaker 4>But pro-america enemy.</v>

939
00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:00.920
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

940
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.340
<v Speaker 4>Even controversial doled ted's </v>
<v Speaker 4>controversial,</v>

941
00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.470
<v Speaker 4>but you know exactly what it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>marketing.</v>

942
00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:07.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking fascinating is what it is.</v>

943
00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:09.040
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>somebody,</v>

944
00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:10.210
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>

945
00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:14.020
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they swift voted for john kerry,</v>

946
00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:19.530
<v Speaker 5>bill clinton had the best point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the minute they swift boated </v>

947
00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:20.420
<v Speaker 5>them when they said he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he wasn't a hero,</v>

948
00:42:20.421 --> 00:42:25.421
<v Speaker 5>isn't all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>he should have challenged dick cheney </v>

949
00:42:25.421 --> 00:42:27.610
<v Speaker 5>and George Bush to a debate about </v>
<v Speaker 5>Vietnam and he would've won the election</v>

950
00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:28.960
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

951
00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:32.700
<v Speaker 4>I think the way he laid down after that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was all over.</v>

952
00:42:32.701 --> 00:42:37.701
<v Speaker 4>It was almost like he's not really </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanting to be president in the first </v>

953
00:42:37.701 --> 00:42:37.701
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>

954
00:42:37.701 --> 00:42:38.300
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

955
00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.260
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a,</v>

956
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.310
<v Speaker 5>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

957
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:42.570
<v Speaker 5>he's soft.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

958
00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:43.610
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's one of those things.</v>

959
00:42:43.611 --> 00:42:45.380
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like democrats,</v>

960
00:42:45.381 --> 00:42:47.840
<v Speaker 5>if they have a shitty candidate will </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of admit it.</v>

961
00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.720
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eh,</v>

962
00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:50.870
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like republicans kind of did with</v>

963
00:42:50.871 --> 00:42:53.000
<v Speaker 5>mccain where they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

964
00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:58.260
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so far as to get sarah pailin to join </v>

965
00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:58.260
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how little they believed in him.</v>

966
00:42:58.260 --> 00:42:58.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

967
00:42:58.631 --> 00:43:01.330
<v Speaker 4>Wanted to do a little bit the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wanted to go to the party favor.</v>

968
00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

969
00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:05.290
<v Speaker 4>Then now this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this michelle barre.</v>

970
00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:07.770
<v Speaker 5>When things fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you,</v>

971
00:43:07.771 --> 00:43:11.430
<v Speaker 5>I understand you want to be in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you want to win.</v>

972
00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:13.070
<v Speaker 5>That's where this winning thing comes </v>
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

973
00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:18.380
<v Speaker 5>You want to win,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but at what cost do you really think </v>

974
00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.040
<v Speaker 5>she's good at being charged or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something?</v>

975
00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:24.790
<v Speaker 4>Here's the real question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did this country become like this?</v>

976
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.620
<v Speaker 4>Why are other countries more relaxed </v>
<v Speaker 4>wise like Italy the way it is,</v>

977
00:43:29.621 --> 00:43:29.980
<v Speaker 4>why</v>

978
00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:32.500
<v Speaker 5>Italy is really disorganized?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are,</v>

979
00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:34.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean in terms of what are you talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about?</v>

980
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:36.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean about the people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about people,</v>

981
00:43:36.631 --> 00:43:41.631
<v Speaker 4>their behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they accept and what they don't </v>

982
00:43:41.631 --> 00:43:43.971
<v Speaker 4>accept,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why they're driven and whether or not </v>

983
00:43:43.971 --> 00:43:43.971
<v Speaker 4>driven</v>

984
00:43:43.971 --> 00:43:43.971
<v Speaker 5>well that that's an I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

985
00:43:43.971 --> 00:43:44.450
<v Speaker 5>people come here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

986
00:43:44.451 --> 00:43:48.340
<v Speaker 5>I think that originally people came to </v>
<v Speaker 5>America to escape.</v>

987
00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:53.970
<v Speaker 5>I always call us like not england,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever angle is like they don't have </v>

988
00:43:53.970 --> 00:43:57.871
<v Speaker 5>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well we fucking have nothing but guns </v>

989
00:43:57.871 --> 00:43:57.871
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

990
00:43:57.871 --> 00:43:58.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

991
00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.470
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

992
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:06.760
<v Speaker 5>the character of America is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is this kind of outlaw thing.</v>

993
00:44:08.681 --> 00:44:12.400
<v Speaker 5>It's certainly become this outlaw thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it has become.</v>

994
00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:15.160
<v Speaker 5>We make best fucking cars and we got the</v>
<v Speaker 5>data.</v>

995
00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:18.050
<v Speaker 5>It's just constant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody believes we make the best car.</v>

996
00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:19.820
<v Speaker 5>Whatever you were saying where you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

997
00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:22.300
<v Speaker 5>we need to make muscle cars.</v>

<v Speaker 5>but queers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

999
00:44:26.471 --> 00:44:30.310
<v Speaker 5>If you asked a bunch of people in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>south and the north west,</v>

1000
00:44:30.311 --> 00:44:31.380
<v Speaker 5>if they will go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1001
00:44:31.381 --> 00:44:33.990
<v Speaker 5>fucking America does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all that stuff of we're the best.</v>

1002
00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:35.970
<v Speaker 5>You don't really hear it in other </v>
<v Speaker 5>countries.</v>

1003
00:44:35.971 --> 00:44:37.440
<v Speaker 5>You hear like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a nice</v>

1004

<v Speaker 6>but you don't go.</v>

<v Speaker 6>We're the best in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are so polite about it.</v>

1006
00:44:42.911 --> 00:44:44.680
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>canadians are doing good down.</v>

<v Speaker 6>in the american character.</v>

1009
00:44:51.851 --> 00:44:52.690
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it has</v>

1010
00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:55.510
<v Speaker 5>to do with the old west.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the last,</v>

1011
00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:01.160

1012
00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:01.160
<v Speaker 5>settled in the world was the west.</v>

1013
00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.700
<v Speaker 6>So it's just wild douche bags,</v>

1014
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:08.410
<v Speaker 5>dia that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a great question.</v>

1015
00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:13.440
<v Speaker 5>It's one of those guns,</v>
<v Speaker 5>germs and steel steel things where you </v>

1016
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:16.481

<v Speaker 5>little rough because of the prison </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>

1019

<v Speaker 5>well in terms of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm saying the american character in</v>

<v Speaker 5>terms of like we're the best,</v>

1032
00:45:47.710 --> 00:45:52.710
<v Speaker 6>We don't have a hero right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do we have an action hero semester </v>

1033
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.170
<v Speaker 6>stallone to 70 fucking years old?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's still beating people up.</v>

1034
00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:54.980
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1035
00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
<v Speaker 6>like the rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not really much of an action hero </v>

1036
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:00.000
<v Speaker 6>because he is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's legit,</v>

1037
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:00.130
<v Speaker 6>but he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's not legit.</v>

1038
00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.840
<v Speaker 6>Like stallone was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1039
00:46:01.841 --> 00:46:03.160
<v Speaker 6>not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1040
00:46:03.161 --> 00:46:04.300
<v Speaker 6>but it's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1041
00:46:04.301 --> 00:46:08.890
<v Speaker 6>the thing about stallone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stallone was legit as an actor first.</v>

1042
00:46:08.891 --> 00:46:11.260
<v Speaker 6>Like with rocky,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was legitimate and an actor.</v>

1043
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:16.870
<v Speaker 6>He was respected.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then he went on commercial as commercial</v>

1044
00:46:16.871 --> 00:46:21.871
<v Speaker 6>as you can get like many,</v>
<v Speaker 6>many times that he started out as that </v>

1045
00:46:21.871 --> 00:46:24.490
<v Speaker 6>legit guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But in terms of action stars,</v>

1048
00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:37.930
<v Speaker 6>different action star,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's the same way.</v>

1049
00:46:37.931 --> 00:46:38.290
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

<v Speaker 5>daily beast.</v>

1058
00:47:07.641 --> 00:47:10.910
<v Speaker 5>I would never go on fox news.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would never.</v>

1059
00:47:10.911 --> 00:47:12.500
<v Speaker 5>I actually tweeted a couple of weeks </v>
<v Speaker 5>ago,</v>

1060
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:17.890
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which news do you guys root for fox or </v>

1061
00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:17.890
<v Speaker 5>cnn?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because that's what it's come to.</v>

1062
00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:22.790
<v Speaker 5>It's come down to these teams of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like that news.</v>

1063
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:24.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is a while.</v>

1064
00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:28.040
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it ought to be facts.</v>

1065
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:30.790
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it's come down to this like,</v>

1066
00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:35.220
<v Speaker 5>tell me the facts that favor my ego </v>
<v Speaker 5>telling me that,</v>

1067
00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.640
<v Speaker 5>spin this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that.</v>

1068
00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.890
<v Speaker 5>So that my worldview is confirmed.</v>

1069
00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:43.920
<v Speaker 4>It is amazing and we've allowed </v>
<v Speaker 4>entertainment to enter into the news </v>

1070
00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:47.140
<v Speaker 4>because that is exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Editorial and entertainment.</v>

1071
00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:47.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1072
00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.140
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever you see some fucking guy and he</v>

1073
00:47:50.141 --> 00:47:53.140
<v Speaker 4>gets busted doing something creepy </v>
<v Speaker 4>sexually and he's like a senator.</v>

1074
00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:57.200
<v Speaker 4>Fox news will always put democrat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>second,</v>

1075
00:47:57.980 --> 00:47:59.540
<v Speaker 4>doesn't matter if that guy's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>republican,</v>

1076
00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.600
<v Speaker 4>they'll put democrat and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>correct it,</v>

1077
00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:07.900
<v Speaker 4>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most important thing is that the </v>

1078
00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:11.981
<v Speaker 4>first inclination,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first image was another pervert </v>

1079
00:48:11.981 --> 00:48:11.981
<v Speaker 4>democrat.</v>

1080
00:48:11.981 --> 00:48:13.590
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's illegal,</v>

1081
00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:15.270
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You guys are criminals.</v>

1082
00:48:15.271 --> 00:48:18.720
<v Speaker 5>But if the fucking sending the news,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're a propaganda machine.</v>

1083
00:48:18.721 --> 00:48:21.660
<v Speaker 5>They are very probably supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>protected from that.</v>

1084
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:22.620
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they,</v>

1085
00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:23.430
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1086
00:48:23.431 --> 00:48:24.660
<v Speaker 5>that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all gone.</v>

1087
00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:26.970
<v Speaker 5>This is the protection from that dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the internet.</v>

1088
00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:28.620
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

1089
00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:31.110
<v Speaker 5>Since doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing your pockets.</v>

1090
00:48:31.111 --> 00:48:31.690
<v Speaker 5>The first one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

1091
00:48:31.691 --> 00:48:36.530
<v Speaker 5>it was six weeks ago or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really see the value of the.</v>

1092
00:48:36.930 --> 00:48:39.960
<v Speaker 5>It's just so democratic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking fair.</v>

1093
00:48:39.961 --> 00:48:44.910
<v Speaker 5>Because I went on the road and I had </v>
<v Speaker 5>people showing up from twitter and I was</v>

1094
00:48:44.911 --> 00:48:49.911
<v Speaker 5>getting like the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was getting a bunch of money at the </v>

1095
00:48:49.911 --> 00:48:53.001
<v Speaker 5>door,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I was getting a percentage of the </v>

1096
00:48:53.001 --> 00:48:53.001
<v Speaker 5>door instead of this thing of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

00:48:53.001 --> 00:48:56.250
<v Speaker 5>we'll give you 1500 for the weekend and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then you maybe if you make the bonus,</v>

1098
00:48:56.251 --> 00:48:59.340
<v Speaker 5>which you never going to make,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then I can do one show,</v>

1099
00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.190
<v Speaker 5>tweet it out and get a grant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

1100
00:49:02.191 --> 00:49:07.191
<v Speaker 5>Get like a fair wage for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the skill and the,</v>

1101
00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:11.160
<v Speaker 5>a popularity instead of them going like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1102
00:49:11.161 --> 00:49:12.480
<v Speaker 5>you're not popular,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going,</v>

1103
00:49:12.481 --> 00:49:17.481
<v Speaker 5>but I have 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>people on twitter who sam popular come </v>

1104
00:49:17.851 --> 00:49:21.290
<v Speaker 5>to the show and yet you're telling me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

1105
00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:23.220
<v Speaker 5>So that's what's great about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>internet is,</v>

1106
00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.620
<v Speaker 5>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is really fair.</v>

1107
00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:26.790
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

1108
00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:31.230
<v Speaker 5>and I didn't even realize the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>power of it.</v>

1109
00:49:31.231 --> 00:49:36.231
<v Speaker 5>you were quick to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't because of your worldview or </v>

1110
00:49:36.231 --> 00:49:37.200
<v Speaker 5>was it because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1111
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:40.920
<v Speaker 5>because you just happened to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you lucked into it.</v>

1112
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:45.950
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been pretty deeply embedded into </v>

1113
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:49.131
<v Speaker 4>the internet since 1998.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a message board on my website and </v>

1114
00:49:49.131 --> 00:49:52.290
<v Speaker 4>so from 1998 I would write blogs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>interact with people on my message board</v>

1115
00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:57.320
<v Speaker 4>and I think in 2001 we switched it over </v>
<v Speaker 4>to a vbulletin and now it's kinda like </v>

1116
00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.250
<v Speaker 4>$5 million posts on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't know how many thousands </v>

1118
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:06.741
<v Speaker 4>of members,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's super active and people are </v>

1119
00:50:06.741 --> 00:50:07.080
<v Speaker 4>constantly posting on a regular basis </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a.</v>

1120
00:50:07.081 --> 00:50:11.340
<v Speaker 4>There's great value in connecting with </v>
<v Speaker 4>people online.</v>

1121
00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:16.370
<v Speaker 4>The biggest resource in human history </v>
<v Speaker 4>for gathering information,</v>

1122
00:50:16.561 --> 00:50:18.990
<v Speaker 4>for being introduced to new information </v>
<v Speaker 4>is this.</v>

1123
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:21.510
<v Speaker 4>Nothing is like twitter has ever existed</v>
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>

1124
00:50:21.511 --> 00:50:23.940
<v Speaker 4>Every fucking day someone's sending </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone.</v>

1128
00:50:33.321 --> 00:50:35.270
<v Speaker 1>nest to see who would win the horn of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spider.</v>

<v Speaker 1>spoiler alert.</v>

1132
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:47.810

<v Speaker 1>even if I have spider,</v>

1133
00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:49.910
<v Speaker 1>spider,</v>

<v Speaker 1>one accidentally.</v>

1145
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.150
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize I'd killed until I </v>
<v Speaker 1>stepped on it.</v>

1146
00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:24.080
<v Speaker 1>It was in front of my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like my fucking hand was my hand.</v>

1147
00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:25.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not joking.</v>

1149
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:33.140
<v Speaker 1>I really didn't realize how big it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stepped on it and it crunched and then</v>

1150
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:38.150
<v Speaker 1>I went back inside the house and got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>flashlight and came outside and looked </v>

<v Speaker 1>loose.</v>

1153
00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that freak you out that when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>lay in your bed that some spiders that </v>

1154

<v Speaker 1>could crawl from the host of fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor.</v>

<v Speaker 1>in this place because it was like an </v>
<v Speaker 1>open air cabana and that's how they kind</v>

1161
00:52:04.051 --> 00:52:09.051
<v Speaker 1>of kept at cooley were above the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 1>and above the wall there was like a gap </v>

1162
00:52:09.051 --> 00:52:10.010
<v Speaker 1>between the ceiling and the wall.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but this isn't that bad.</v>

1167
00:52:23.841 --> 00:52:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then you got to kill a </v>
<v Speaker 1>snake.</v>

1168

<v Speaker 1>And because I've got kids and </v>

<v Speaker 1>rattlesnakes can go fuck themselves.</v>

<v Speaker 1>realize I had run over it until I was in</v>

00:54:07.661 --> 00:54:08.260
<v Speaker 5>Is there anything?</v>

1207
00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:09.610

1208
00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:14.640
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of right wing guys on my </v>

1209

1214
00:54:27.851 --> 00:54:30.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that if you can express yourself</v>

1215
00:54:30.970 --> 00:54:35.970
<v Speaker 4>as long as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let people know how you feel about </v>

1216
00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:35.970
<v Speaker 4>things you should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should do.</v>

1217
00:54:35.970 --> 00:54:39.991
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck are you like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should do what you want and not </v>

1218
00:54:39.991 --> 00:54:39.991
<v Speaker 4>worry about others.</v>

1219

1222
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:45.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm not taking it down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what I.</v>

1223
00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:50.380
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the George Bush thing and just go </v>

1224
00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.601
<v Speaker 5>like he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>George Bush never made a mistake </v>

1225
00:54:52.601 --> 00:54:52.601
<v Speaker 5>because.</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1226
00:54:52.601 --> 00:54:53.060
<v Speaker 5>well that's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like some people go when,</v>

1227
00:54:53.061 --> 00:54:54.830
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we killed in london,</v>

1228
00:54:54.831 --> 00:54:59.831
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or gets killed or whatever you want to </v>

1229
00:54:59.831 --> 00:54:59.990
<v Speaker 5>say it in people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think they get that credit.</v>

1230
00:54:59.991 --> 00:55:00.650
<v Speaker 5>Bush somehow.</v>

1231
00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:04.800
<v Speaker 4>If there's one constant in all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that I do meet,</v>

1232
00:55:04.801 --> 00:55:09.801
<v Speaker 4>is that there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Surprisingly nice and I get this from </v>

1233
00:55:09.801 --> 00:55:12.981
<v Speaker 4>comedy club waitresses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're always saying that when we do </v>

1234
00:55:12.981 --> 00:55:12.981
<v Speaker 4>theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people always say that like,</v>

1235
00:55:12.981 --> 00:55:14.280
<v Speaker 4>your fans are so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're you guys.</v>

1236
00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.160
<v Speaker 4>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's anything I try to put out,</v>

1237
00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:22.250
<v Speaker 4>are they put up like underdogs?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess everyone's maybe in this world </v>

1238
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:25.500
<v Speaker 4>if you're not a fucking ceo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're an underdog.</v>

1239
00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:26.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1240
00:55:26.431 --> 00:55:31.431
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If what you said about corporations is </v>

1241
00:55:31.431 --> 00:55:31.431
<v Speaker 4>true and it is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1242
00:55:31.431 --> 00:55:35.001
<v Speaker 4>we're all underdogs and we're all in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this together and I think if there's </v>

1243
00:55:35.001 --> 00:55:39.651
<v Speaker 4>anything they share is that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of fucking nice people that come to </v>

1244
00:55:39.651 --> 00:55:42.201
<v Speaker 4>my shows and people that are just trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to have some fun man and people that </v>

1245
00:55:42.201 --> 00:55:44.520
<v Speaker 4>respect someone who's going to say what </v>
<v Speaker 4>they really think.</v>

1246
00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:46.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the other thing politically,</v>

1247
00:55:46.751 --> 00:55:49.450
<v Speaker 5>that they've been learning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Studies have elections.</v>

1248
00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:53.920
<v Speaker 5>They people vote for people with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>courage of their convictions.</v>

1249
00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:55.660
<v Speaker 5>That's why they go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a flip flopper.</v>

1250
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:57.190
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck this guy.</v>

1251
00:55:57.580 --> 00:56:02.580
<v Speaker 5>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He takes into consideration facts and </v>

1252
00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:06.270
<v Speaker 5>changes his opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That fucking fuck this guy because he </v>

1253
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:09.190
<v Speaker 5>just needs you to be like this pillar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's George Bush was a pillar of,</v>

1254
00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:12.730
<v Speaker 5>I believe stupidity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he wasn't.</v>

1255
00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:13.930
<v Speaker 5>He didn't move.</v>

1256
00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:19.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They also have everybody convinced that </v>

1257
00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:19.460
<v Speaker 4>if you do flip flop and get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're done.</v>

1258
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:21.950

1279
00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I was dating two girls.</v>

1280
00:57:05.970 --> 00:57:10.970
<v Speaker 5>One came over thursday night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She had very short hair then and she </v>

1281
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:14.040
<v Speaker 5>gave me oral sex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>friday night,</v>

1282
00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.240
<v Speaker 5>a long haired girl come over.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She,</v>

1283
00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:20.040
<v Speaker 5>she don't come over and we had regular </v>
<v Speaker 5>sex.</v>

1284
00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:23.850
<v Speaker 5>A saturday night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the short haired girl comes back,</v>

1285
00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:27.210
<v Speaker 5>we have oral sex again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go to the bathroom,</v>

1286
00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:29.820
<v Speaker 5>she comes out and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey neil,</v>

1287
00:57:29.821 --> 00:57:31.110
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to sleep with other </v>
<v Speaker 5>girls,</v>

1288
00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:34.200
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>be a little more clever about it.</v>

1289
00:57:34.201 --> 00:57:35.040
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what are you talking about?</v>

1290
00:57:35.041 --> 00:57:40.041
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just found a hairband and economy </v>

1291
00:57:40.041 --> 00:57:41.520
<v Speaker 5>behind your bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now I'm basically cold,</v>

1292
00:57:41.521 --> 00:57:43.850
<v Speaker 5>busted and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I took a pause,</v>

1293
00:57:43.851 --> 00:57:44.760
<v Speaker 5>like a really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she goes,</v>

1294
00:57:44.761 --> 00:57:45.240
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I go,</v>

1295
00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:48.000
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what has been going on in here?</v>

1296
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:51.810
<v Speaker 5>And just walked out of the room and she </v>
<v Speaker 5>was fine with it.</v>

1297
00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:56.850
<v Speaker 5>What's because I just sold you just go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

1298
00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:57.960
<v Speaker 5>And just</v>

1299
00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:02.370
<v Speaker 1>eddie murray used to do a joke about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's like just denied.</v>

1300
00:58:02.371 --> 00:58:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Denied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denied.</v>

1301
00:58:03.091 --> 00:58:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Denied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denied.</v>

1302
00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's better than denying instead </v>

1303
00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:09.060
<v Speaker 1>of denying you're incredulous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't believe this is going down.</v>

1304
00:58:09.570 --> 00:58:12.810
<v Speaker 1>That's better than denying who you </v>
<v Speaker 1>reacted perfectly.</v>

1305
00:58:12.811 --> 00:58:14.700
<v Speaker 1>If you denied it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have probably been busted.</v>

1306
00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But instead of denying it,</v>

1307
00:58:16.051 --> 00:58:21.051
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't even consider it as a </v>

1308
00:58:21.051 --> 00:58:21.051
<v Speaker 1>possibility that you could have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing.</v>

1309
00:58:21.051 --> 00:58:21.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were like,</v>

1310
00:58:21.051 --> 00:58:23.540
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to talk to them</v>

1311
00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:25.080
<v Speaker 5>manager or something?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1312
00:58:25.081 --> 00:58:27.330
<v Speaker 5>You must have a clean underneath bed </v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

1313
00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:32.340
<v Speaker 5>I never clean underneath my bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So even if a girl came underneath my </v>

1314
00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:32.340
<v Speaker 5>bed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she'd be like,</v>

1315
00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:32.360
<v Speaker 5>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's $500 bucks.</v>

1316
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:35.640
<v Speaker 5>Somebody taught me a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're dating more than one girl,</v>

1317
00:58:35.641 --> 00:58:37.980
<v Speaker 5>you gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you gotta have a lint brush.</v>

1318
00:58:38.010 --> 00:58:39.490
<v Speaker 5>That's the key.</v>
<v Speaker 5>when pro,</v>

1319
00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:43.470
<v Speaker 5>because they girls shared a lot of hair </v>
<v Speaker 5>and earrings.</v>

1320
00:58:43.530 --> 00:58:46.410
<v Speaker 5>You gotta scoop earrings out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to have a lint brush.</v>

1321
00:58:46.411 --> 00:58:49.950
<v Speaker 5>You really gotta be on top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're getting variety.</v>

1322
00:58:49.951 --> 00:58:51.030
<v Speaker 5>Jail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1323
00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:52.860
<v Speaker 5>but you're also.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lotta,</v>

1324
00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.450
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's.</v>

1325
00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:59.480
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people don't think about it from the </v>

1326
00:58:59.480 --> 00:58:59.480
<v Speaker 5>guy's point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who's,</v>

1327
00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:01.580
<v Speaker 5>who has to date three different women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't.</v>

1328
00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.480
<v Speaker 5>They only see it if you're a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1329
00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:06.960
<v Speaker 5>but do you have any idea of the stress?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm under that.</v>

1330
00:59:06.961 --> 00:59:11.961
<v Speaker 5>I'm constantly having a lint brush </v>
<v Speaker 5>things and fucking collect the earrings </v>

1331
00:59:11.961 --> 00:59:12.090
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>

1332
00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:13.590
<v Speaker 5>socks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People.</v>

1333
00:59:13.591 --> 00:59:13.740
<v Speaker 5>Don't.</v>

1334
00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:15.390
<v Speaker 1>People feel bad for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1335
00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:18.830
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to cheat and not get </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked with you.</v>

1336
00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Fucking these broads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got to get off my back.</v>

1337
00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 1>What</v>

1338
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.070
<v Speaker 4>do you think about people that want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>live a,</v>

1339
00:59:24.071 --> 00:59:26.810
<v Speaker 4>a polyamorous life and just continue </v>
<v Speaker 4>that forever?</v>

1340
00:59:26.811 --> 00:59:31.811
<v Speaker 4>Like the idea that we should never be </v>
<v Speaker 4>committed to one person and we all </v>

1341
00:59:31.811 --> 00:59:34.340
<v Speaker 4>should stop being so jealous about what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what our loved ones do with their bodies</v>

1342
00:59:34.341 --> 00:59:36.980
<v Speaker 4>and just go and have a wild.</v>

1343
00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:39.880
<v Speaker 5>It seems crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a great idea.</v>

1344
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:44.770
<v Speaker 5>In theory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's good cause I like I have a.</v>

1345
00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:48.940
<v Speaker 5>I had a girlfriend and then we broke up </v>
<v Speaker 5>and now it seems as if we're going to.</v>

1346
00:59:48.970 --> 00:59:51.310
<v Speaker 5>We're headed back to togetherness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh shit.</v>

1347
00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:52.480
<v Speaker 5>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hi.</v>

1348
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:57.870
<v Speaker 5>I'm and I'm and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we were talking about it yesterday </v>

1349
00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:59.950
<v Speaker 5>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is my problem with relationships is</v>

1350
01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:05.620
<v Speaker 5>you have to make an emotional promise in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the future.</v>

1351
01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:10.420
<v Speaker 5>So I have to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to love you 10 years from now.</v>

1352
01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:15.010
<v Speaker 5>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've changed so much in three years.</v>

1353
01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:17.830
<v Speaker 5>the fact that I'm making fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>emotional promises.</v>

1354
01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.110
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hope I love you.</v>

1355
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.360
<v Speaker 5>I hope I love you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the idea of going like,</v>

1356
01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:27.630
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you I love you and if I </v>
<v Speaker 5>can't then you get half of my shit.</v>

1357
01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:32.220
<v Speaker 5>I bet you that I'm going to love you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll bet you half my shit that I'm going</v>

1358
01:00:32.221 --> 01:00:32.290
<v Speaker 5>to</v>

1359
01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:35.900
<v Speaker 4>relationships make sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course marrIage doesn't make sense to</v>

1360
01:00:35.901 --> 01:00:40.901
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Less kids are involved and even then I </v>

1361
01:00:40.901 --> 01:00:43.631
<v Speaker 4>only got married because of my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted her to be happy and I wasn't </v>

1362
01:00:43.631 --> 01:00:47.621
<v Speaker 4>going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm committed to the whole thing and </v>

1363
01:00:47.621 --> 01:00:49.460
<v Speaker 4>raising children all requires this level</v>
<v Speaker 4>of commitment and that and I'm more than</v>

1364
01:00:49.461 --> 01:00:54.461
<v Speaker 4>willing to embrace it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only reason why I was willing to do </v>

1365
01:00:54.461 --> 01:00:54.461
<v Speaker 4>it legally and sign all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1366
01:00:54.461 --> 01:00:57.800
<v Speaker 4>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is some crazy stupid tradition.</v>

1367
01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:02.980
<v Speaker 4>It's completely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then sayIng you should have to break up </v>

1368
01:01:02.980 --> 01:01:03.680
<v Speaker 4>and you have to bring in the legal </v>
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>

1369
01:01:03.681 --> 01:01:07.370
<v Speaker 4>So to do it without children to me seems</v>
<v Speaker 4>preposterous.</v>

1370
01:01:07.371 --> 01:01:12.371
<v Speaker 4>To do it with children is ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I submitted to it but to do it just </v>

1371
01:01:12.371 --> 01:01:14.930
<v Speaker 4>because you're in love like my god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're crazy.</v>

1372
01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:17.480
<v Speaker 4>You're connecting yourself with someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>legally and</v>

1373
01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:19.580
<v Speaker 6>well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you really fucking know them?</v>

1374
01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:21.610
<v Speaker 6>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's fucking.</v>

1375
01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.500
<v Speaker 6>You don't specify things are going </v>
<v Speaker 6>great.</v>

1376
01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:28.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When your life is going great and </v>

1377
01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:28.530
<v Speaker 6>everything's going great,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you you barely know people.</v>

1378
01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:29.770
<v Speaker 6>You know them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When some shit hits the fan,</v>

1379
01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:34.800
<v Speaker 6>it's easy to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's easy to know somebody when you're </v>

1380
01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:34.800
<v Speaker 6>in fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're both in love with each.</v>

1381
01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.920
<v Speaker 6>Exactly what's the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Especially in the beginning because </v>

1382
01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:38.920
<v Speaker 6>every little annoyances like,</v>

1383
01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:38.920
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a little thing,</v>

1384
01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:43.170
<v Speaker 5>and then it metastasizes and it's three </v>
<v Speaker 5>and a half years later and you're like,</v>

1385
01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:43.560
<v Speaker 5>ooh,</v>

1386
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:48.040
<v Speaker 6>and also you might be evolving and them </v>
<v Speaker 6>not advice averse.</v>

1387
01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:48.410
<v Speaker 6>You know</v>

1388
01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:54.840
<v Speaker 5>how you've evolved as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You almost are saying when you're in,</v>

1389

<v Speaker 5>going to change.</v>

1391
01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:06.480
<v Speaker 5>It's like it just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems like a state basis</v>

1392
01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:08.710
<v Speaker 4>when you could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could get involved with the chicken.</v>

1393
01:02:08.711 --> 01:02:12.040
<v Speaker 4>Then she can turn vegan on you and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in the middle of the relationship</v>

1394
01:02:12.041 --> 01:02:14.590
<v Speaker 4>and all of a sudden they're giving you </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit about eating cheeseburgers.</v>

1400
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:32.490
<v Speaker 5>Like the amount of greenhouse gases,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cows and mitch shit like that.</v>

1413
01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:10.880
<v Speaker 1>One of the producers sent me a text </v>
<v Speaker 1>message when we had signed the deal </v>

1414
01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.500

<v Speaker 1>because it was a,</v>

1415
01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:18.710
<v Speaker 1>was an inside joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would take the pot lollipop every day </v>

1418
01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.930
<v Speaker 1>When I was stoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would come in,</v>

1419
01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:26.931
<v Speaker 1>if I wasn't stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think about all the shit that I </v>

1420
01:03:26.931 --> 01:03:29.211
<v Speaker 1>could be doing at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be playing pool with one of my </v>

1421
01:03:29.211 --> 01:03:29.520
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could go to jujitsu class,</v>

1422
01:03:29.521 --> 01:03:31.710
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do all these things that I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>then all of a sudden I'm like a fucking </v>

1427
01:03:48.901 --> 01:03:52.371

1462
01:05:19.850 --> 01:05:19.850
<v Speaker 1>medical properties for</v>

1463
01:05:19.850 --> 01:05:23.040
<v Speaker 4>dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is dmt exists in many </v>

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.981
<v Speaker 4>different plants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just one and all the plants that it </v>

1465
01:05:25.981 --> 01:05:28.371
<v Speaker 4>exists in our legal right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you can actually have a plant that </v>

1466
01:05:28.371 --> 01:05:32.370
<v Speaker 4>contains dmt in it and it's not like </v>
<v Speaker 4>having a marijuana plant which contains </v>

1467
01:05:32.370 --> 01:05:33.370
<v Speaker 4>thc.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The dmt plant would not be illegal.</v>

1468
01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:35.950
<v Speaker 4>It would only be illegal if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>extracted it,</v>

1469
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:37.960
<v Speaker 4>went into the plant and took this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

1470
01:05:37.961 --> 01:05:39.840
<v Speaker 4>But the problem is also exists in your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

1503
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.320
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the chamber.</v>

<v Speaker 6>to do it?</v>

1505
01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:50.170
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who's holding you back?</v>

1506
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:51.610
<v Speaker 6>If you want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why haven't you done it yet?</v>

1507
01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.790
<v Speaker 6>You're one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have fox something.</v>

1508
01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:56.560
<v Speaker 6>There's a force.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people are scared,</v>

1509
01:06:56.570 --> 01:06:57.670
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>scared of themselves.</v>

1510

<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1511
01:06:58.541 --> 01:07:00.040

<v Speaker 6>I feel like I know my foot pretty well.</v>

1512
01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:02.150
<v Speaker 4>That tank is you buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you know yourself,</v>

1513
01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:03.470
<v Speaker 4>you've got to get to know yourself much </v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

1514
01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.450
<v Speaker 4>Tank is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're high.</v>

1515
01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:10.860
<v Speaker 4>The scariest most self soul searching </v>
<v Speaker 4>moments I've ever had is alone in that </v>

1516
01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:11.300
<v Speaker 4>tank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On a pot.</v>

1517
01:07:11.301 --> 01:07:12.560
<v Speaker 4>Brownie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1518
01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.720
<v Speaker 4>Because the marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you,</v>

1519
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:19.750
<v Speaker 4>when you eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially anything that's fucking with </v>

1520
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.750
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything that's in your head that you're</v>

1521
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:20.750
<v Speaker 4>not happy with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just gets exposed.</v>

1522
01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.850
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the beauty of that tank.</v>

1523
01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.700
<v Speaker 4>It's just like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just the,</v>

1524
01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:30.770
<v Speaker 4>like the best show for you to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is your life.</v>

1525
01:07:31.851 --> 01:07:32.750
<v Speaker 4>That is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1526
01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.250
<v Speaker 4>Here is you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is you.</v>

1527
01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:36.470
<v Speaker 4>We're going to put on a show and we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to show you.</v>

1528
01:07:36.471 --> 01:07:38.660
<v Speaker 4>We're going to do a documentary on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1529
01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:42.610
<v Speaker 6>What changes did you make every result </v>
<v Speaker 6>of?</v>

1530
01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:47.320
<v Speaker 6>I'm not talking about outlook.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about talking about behavior</v>

1531
01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:49.390
<v Speaker 6>from the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1532
01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:51.450
<v Speaker 6>I think it slow.</v>

1533
01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:54.400
<v Speaker 4>Slowly but surely made me a nicer </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

1534
01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:55.200
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1535
01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Made me more humble.</v>

1536
01:07:57.670 --> 01:08:00.910
<v Speaker 4>I think all the psychedelic experiences </v>
<v Speaker 4>make you humble.</v>

1537
01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:06.060
<v Speaker 4>They're all very humbling because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're very ego dissolving and there </v>

1538
01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:06.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1539
01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:08.350
<v Speaker 4>you feel like you're connected with </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything and when you come back you're</v>

1540
01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:09.220
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

1541
01:08:09.221 --> 01:08:11.930
<v Speaker 4>just knowing that that experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>exists,</v>

1542
01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:14.650
<v Speaker 6>you've heard that you've sought study </v>
<v Speaker 6>where people that did shrooms,</v>

1543
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 6>like adult</v>

1544
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:21.130
<v Speaker 5>did it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like conservative adults and I think </v>

1545
01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:24.491
<v Speaker 5>seven of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seven out of 10 said it was one of the </v>

1546
01:08:24.491 --> 01:08:27.460
<v Speaker 5>best spiritual experiences of their life</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they do it again.</v>

1547
01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:28.880
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1548
01:08:29.250 --> 01:08:29.880
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1549
01:08:29.881 --> 01:08:34.881
<v Speaker 1>I would encourage them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always said I would encourage my </v>

1550
01:08:34.881 --> 01:08:34.881
<v Speaker 1>kids to do sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1551
01:08:34.881 --> 01:08:37.110
<v Speaker 1>it's all about set and setting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have taken them in party ideas,</v>

1552
01:08:37.111 --> 01:08:39.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a party saying and you know,</v>

1553
01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.850
<v Speaker 1>had a bad time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they got too high.</v>

1554
01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:46.851
<v Speaker 1>It had a bad trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all what it's going to take you on </v>

1555
01:08:46.851 --> 01:08:49.761
<v Speaker 1>a journey and you have to submit to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>journey and you also have to be willing </v>

1556
01:08:49.761 --> 01:08:50.070
<v Speaker 1>to go for a ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1557
01:08:50.071 --> 01:08:55.071
<v Speaker 1>you can't try to resist it if you try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>resist it and hold it back or deny the </v>

1558
01:08:55.071 --> 01:08:57.120
<v Speaker 1>things that it's exposing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a bad trip was all about,</v>

1559
01:08:57.121 --> 01:08:59.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the epitome of a bad trip.</v>

1560
01:08:59.610 --> 01:09:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I also think there's people that just </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't ever do it ever though.</v>

1561
01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like duncan saying yesterday that he </v>

1562
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:09.030
<v Speaker 1>wanted to not dose whatever large </v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of people,</v>

1563
01:09:09.031 --> 01:09:10.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about.</v>

1564
01:09:10.831 --> 01:09:15.831
<v Speaker 1>It's a really brilliant idea in </v>
<v Speaker 1>injecting it into the common cold,</v>

1565
01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:20.280
<v Speaker 1>injecting lsd into the common cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So somehow when you got the common cold,</v>

1566
01:09:20.281 --> 01:09:24.420
<v Speaker 1>you also want in his vast lsd trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1567
01:09:24.421 --> 01:09:25.440
<v Speaker 1>That is brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1568
01:09:25.441 --> 01:09:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Until you get some kid that has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1569
01:09:27.821 --> 01:09:32.821
<v Speaker 1>a whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of alzheimer's or not </v>

1570
01:09:32.821 --> 01:09:32.821
<v Speaker 1>alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1571
01:09:32.821 --> 01:09:34.050
<v Speaker 1>autism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he fucks him.</v>

1572
01:09:34.051 --> 01:09:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes out and shoots up</v>

1573
01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:41.500
<v Speaker 4>a genius idea though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea of spreading something </v>

1574
01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:42.930
<v Speaker 4>psychoactive through a cold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I wonder if that's possible,</v>

1575
01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:45.840
<v Speaker 4>like just the idea of a cold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To me it's so bizarre,</v>

1576
01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:51.020
<v Speaker 4>the idea that there's some invading </v>
<v Speaker 4>organism that tries to shut your body </v>

1577
01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:54.201
<v Speaker 4>down and consuming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to battle it with your immune </v>

1578
01:09:54.201 --> 01:09:56.961
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the fact that maybe this invading </v>

1579
01:09:56.961 --> 01:09:56.961
<v Speaker 4>army,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my kerrick psychedelic chemicals,</v>

1580
01:09:56.970 --> 01:09:57.360
<v Speaker 4>why not?</v>

1581
01:09:57.590 --> 01:10:01.230
<v Speaker 5>It's where the capital thing comes in </v>
<v Speaker 5>again because capitalism,</v>

1582
01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:02.280
<v Speaker 5>cause they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1583
01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:05.050
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they spend more money on boner pills and</v>

1584
01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:10.200
<v Speaker 5>then they do on solving the common cold </v>
<v Speaker 5>because there's just more money and </v>

1585
01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.380
<v Speaker 5>vulnerable probably aids research than,</v>
<v Speaker 5>than boner pills.</v>

1586
01:10:11.381 --> 01:10:13.250
<v Speaker 5>And it's like because there's just more </v>
<v Speaker 5>money and it's like,</v>

1587
01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:14.840
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're going to do more good.</v>

1588
01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.570
<v Speaker 5>What do you inherent good.</v>

1589
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:20.620
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about the people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't believe that hiv causes aids?</v>

1590
01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:23.460
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard of this argument?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does,</v>

1591
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:29.470
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is the guys?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's one doctor that's like a </v>

1592
01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:29.690
<v Speaker 4>very well respected doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>UH,</v>

1593
01:10:29.710 --> 01:10:34.710
<v Speaker 4>and he's got this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a teacher at the university of </v>

1594
01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:37.000
<v Speaker 4>California in berkeley and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason,</v>

1595
01:10:37.001 --> 01:10:39.430
<v Speaker 4>doesn't believe that hiv causes aids.</v>

1596
01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:41.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1597
01:10:41.361 --> 01:10:46.361
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think a lot all conspiracy theorists </v>

1598
01:10:46.361 --> 01:10:48.560
<v Speaker 5>and all that shit is just about people </v>
<v Speaker 5>going like they're lying.</v>

1599
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:53.590
<v Speaker 5>It's like calling bullshit all the time </v>
<v Speaker 5>so that you feel like you have the upper</v>

1600
01:10:53.871 --> 01:10:54.200
<v Speaker 5>hand</v>

1601
01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:56.640
<v Speaker 4>peter duesberg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1602
01:10:56.641 --> 01:11:01.641
<v Speaker 4>This is the only thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only reason why I listened to this </v>

1603
01:11:01.641 --> 01:11:01.641
<v Speaker 4>guy at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't,</v>

1604
01:11:01.641 --> 01:11:05.301
<v Speaker 4>but the only reason why I would is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a phd professor of molecular </v>

1605
01:11:05.301 --> 01:11:06.870
<v Speaker 4>biology at the university of California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>berkeley.</v>

1606
01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.490
<v Speaker 4>That sounds like a guy who knows things.</v>

1607
01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's hundreds of guys that I </v>

1608
01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:14.730
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so funny when a guy like this,</v>

1609
01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:19.940
<v Speaker 1>like this is my point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in no way saying that hiv does not </v>

1610
01:11:19.940 --> 01:11:22.470
<v Speaker 1>cause aids and nor would I ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck do I know?</v>

1611
01:11:22.471 --> 01:11:26.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm not A doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what freaks me out is when I read.</v>

1612
01:11:26.191 --> 01:11:30.660
<v Speaker 1>So you got a real nice dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got forums like a rattle snake.</v>

1613
01:11:31.290 --> 01:11:36.290
<v Speaker 1>This when a guy like this peter duesberg</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who is way more educated than me in </v>

1614
01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:36.990
<v Speaker 1>the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1615
01:11:36.991 --> 01:11:41.130
<v Speaker 1>and way smarter than me to when this guy</v>

<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1647
01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:57.220

<v Speaker 1>somebody wants to do a shot,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this is like some shit that you would </v>

1659
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.550
<v Speaker 1>say to a check right before you booked </v>
<v Speaker 1>your car.</v>

1660
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a buddy of mine used to say the greatest</v>

1661
01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.320
<v Speaker 1>pickup line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know this buddy.</v>

1662
01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I want to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1663
01:13:29.341 --> 01:13:30.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll know it as immediately.</v>

1664
01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:32.010
<v Speaker 5>He used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1665
01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:34.870
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he would go up to girls and go,</v>

1666
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:40.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they say that spontaneity is a sign of </v>

1667
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:43.891
<v Speaker 5>intelligence and you strike me as a very</v>
<v Speaker 5>spontaneous person would say we go back </v>

1668
01:13:44.201 --> 01:13:48.250
<v Speaker 5>to my place and fuck or something and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>would work.</v>

1669
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.960
<v Speaker 5>Is that your ideas?</v>

1670
01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:55.140
<v Speaker 1>How often would listen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We both intelligent here.</v>

1671
01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:02.220
<v Speaker 1>Let's cut the bullshit in a muffler </v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out there.</v>

1672
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:06.430
<v Speaker 1>It was in the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eighties.</v>

1673
01:14:06.431 --> 01:14:08.740
<v Speaker 1>This is pre a pre aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

1674
01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Which is raw dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1675
01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

1676
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:12.170
<v Speaker 1>That's ted nugent</v>

1677
01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:13.970
<v Speaker 4>song.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Raw dog war hog.</v>

1678
01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.130
<v Speaker 4>One of his war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1679
01:14:16.131 --> 01:14:18.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched a show,</v>

1680
01:14:18.301 --> 01:14:23.301
<v Speaker 4>jay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well this is one of the reasons why </v>

1681
01:14:23.301 --> 01:14:24.721
<v Speaker 4>because I look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I even from people that I disagree with </v>

1682
01:14:24.721 --> 01:14:26.530
<v Speaker 4>them on some things I may agree with </v>
<v Speaker 4>very much so and other things.</v>

1683
01:14:26.531 --> 01:14:31.531
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things I agree with him </v>
<v Speaker 4>is he's a hunter and he gets all of his </v>

1684
01:14:31.531 --> 01:14:36.181
<v Speaker 4>food from his own ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has this huge high fence set up with </v>

1685
01:14:36.181 --> 01:14:36.181
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1686
01:14:36.181 --> 01:14:38.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>several thousand acres he owns and taxes</v>

1687
01:14:38.921 --> 01:14:41.690
<v Speaker 4>and he goes around on his ranch and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoots animals and eat.</v>

1688
01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:44.780
<v Speaker 4>That's what he eats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't eat subsistence.</v>

1689
01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like the idea of that.</v>

1690
01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:48.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love the,</v>

1691
01:14:48.471 --> 01:14:53.471
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that this guy stands up for </v>

1692
01:14:53.471 --> 01:14:54.560
<v Speaker 4>people that think that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong with hunting,</v>

1693
01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:59.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think that's completely </v>

1694
01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:01.271
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if you're eating meat and then </v>

1695
01:15:01.271 --> 01:15:01.271
<v Speaker 4>you're telling people that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't be hunting,</v>

1696
01:15:01.271 --> 01:15:01.370
<v Speaker 4>that's just fucking nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1697
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:03.620
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1698
01:15:03.621 --> 01:15:07.460
<v Speaker 4>hunting is the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want protein from animals,</v>

1699
01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:09.560
<v Speaker 4>that's probably the best way to get it </v>
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>

1700
01:15:09.561 --> 01:15:11.390
<v Speaker 4>And it's probably the best way to get it</v>
<v Speaker 4>for your head.</v>

1701
01:15:11.391 --> 01:15:13.970
<v Speaker 4>So you understand what the fuck meat is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1702
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:16.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason why american indians were,</v>

1703
01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:21.930
<v Speaker 4>were so vigilant when it came to using </v>
<v Speaker 4>every single part of that animal because</v>

1704
01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:25.070
<v Speaker 4>they knew how god damn hard it was to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get a deer.</v>

1705
01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:27.230
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you used every part of that animal.</v>

1706
01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:28.710
<v Speaker 4>Nothing went to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1707
01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.160
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we,</v>

1708
01:15:30.190 --> 01:15:33.200
<v Speaker 4>we have this incredibly wasteful </v>
<v Speaker 4>society,</v>

1709
01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:38.440
<v Speaker 4>incredibly wasteful attitude and I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting and gathering up your own food </v>

1710
01:15:38.631 --> 01:15:40.070
<v Speaker 4>just to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could put that in your hand.</v>

1711
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:42.470
<v Speaker 4>That's really what you're eating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is where it comes from.</v>

1712
01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:47.620
<v Speaker 5>Well the other day about if they thought</v>
<v Speaker 5>the recession would change people's </v>

1713
01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.940
<v Speaker 5>character somewhat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if,</v>

1714
01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.900
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if because of now that because it seemed</v>

1715
01:15:53.901 --> 01:15:58.901
<v Speaker 5>like everyone was rich for 10 years and </v>
<v Speaker 5>now now it seems like everyone's poor </v>

1716
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:05.830
<v Speaker 5>and you hope,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean at least because I would drive </v>

1717
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:07.490
<v Speaker 5>around la and go like make a good living</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I don't have a bmw or I don't have a</v>

1718
01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:10.340
<v Speaker 5>poor whatever these cars are and I would</v>
<v Speaker 5>always think why do people.</v>

1719
01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:15.520
<v Speaker 5>So I'm hoping that it'll go back to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hope people's values will be less </v>

1720
01:16:17.361 --> 01:16:19.620
<v Speaker 5>materialistic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I kind,</v>

1721
01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:20.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could go either way.</v>

1722
01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:25.960
<v Speaker 5>I can make an argument either for either</v>
<v Speaker 5>for either being likely to happen </v>

1723
01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:29.660
<v Speaker 5>because they're not going to stop </v>
<v Speaker 5>promoting consumerism like</v>

1724
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:34.870
<v Speaker 4>bore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're locked into a certain pattern of </v>

1725
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:36.470
<v Speaker 4>behavior and it would take something </v>
<v Speaker 4>monumental shift that it would take some</v>

1726
01:16:36.471 --> 01:16:39.710
<v Speaker 4>19 sixties type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's everybody got on acid?</v>

1727
01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:41.330
<v Speaker 4>It would really take something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1728
01:16:41.331 --> 01:16:41.840
<v Speaker 4>It would just something</v>

1729
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:44.190
<v Speaker 5>that's ever going to happen again </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I haven't.</v>

1730
01:16:44.410 --> 01:16:49.240
<v Speaker 5>I've just had a theory that those </v>
<v Speaker 5>computers are two good shit's too sweet,</v>

1731
01:16:49.241 --> 01:16:50.530
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Too fucking easy.</v>

1732

01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:02.770
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a.</v>

1736
01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.780
<v Speaker 4>There's a thing going on in Florida </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now where they have a real problem</v>

1737
01:17:05.781 --> 01:17:08.990
<v Speaker 4>with these pain management centers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it is.</v>

1738
01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.390
<v Speaker 4>Legal drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1739
01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.270
<v Speaker 4>See cotton's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1740
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:15.200
<v Speaker 4>You can get them at a pain management </v>
<v Speaker 4>center where you go in and you literally</v>

1741
01:17:15.201 --> 01:17:20.201
<v Speaker 4>go to a doctor and then right next store</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the doctor after he writes you a </v>

1742
01:17:20.201 --> 01:17:20.201
<v Speaker 4>prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a pharmacy.</v>

1743
01:17:20.201 --> 01:17:24.680
<v Speaker 4>It's all inside the same building and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what it is is they figured out a way to </v>

1744
01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.550
<v Speaker 4>make heroin in a pill form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really that simple.</v>

1745
01:17:25.730 --> 01:17:28.640
<v Speaker 4>They figured out a way to make heroin in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a pill form and then it got released.</v>

1746
01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:31.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone ever does release,</v>

1747
01:17:31.250 --> 01:17:33.980
<v Speaker 4>whether it's sill assignment or whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck it is,</v>

1748
01:17:34.190 --> 01:17:37.960
<v Speaker 4>when they start releasing it as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>medicine and they are working on that,</v>

1749
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:38.460
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they.</v>

1750
01:17:38.530 --> 01:17:40.150
<v Speaker 4>There was a thing a couple of weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

1751
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:40.690
<v Speaker 4>they are.</v>

1752
01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:43.810
<v Speaker 5>I have the perfect dosage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have the dosage exactly.</v>

1753
01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.910
<v Speaker 5>Not too much and that will get everyone </v>
<v Speaker 5>nice and high.</v>

1754
01:17:47.050 --> 01:17:52.050
<v Speaker 4>What's going to happen is that shit's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to get out just like it gets out </v>

1755
01:17:52.050 --> 01:17:55.201
<v Speaker 4>in Florida and I don't know what state </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be that it's going to be </v>

1756
01:17:55.201 --> 01:17:58.141
<v Speaker 4>one state where the pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 4>companies make some fucking creepy deal </v>

1757
01:17:58.141 --> 01:18:00.370
<v Speaker 4>with congressmen and senators and </v>
<v Speaker 4>somehow or another they allow,</v>

1758
01:18:00.371 --> 01:18:05.371
<v Speaker 4>like in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have a database with the way </v>

1759
01:18:05.371 --> 01:18:05.371
<v Speaker 4>Florida setup is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can be a doctor.</v>

1760
01:18:05.371 --> 01:18:09.630
<v Speaker 4>You could prescribe brian's and </v>
<v Speaker 4>oxycontin's and then brian goes next </v>

1761
01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:09.630
<v Speaker 4>door to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a doctor.</v>

1762
01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:11.560
<v Speaker 4>I prescribed him oxycontin and he goes </v>
<v Speaker 4>down the street and he just keeps going.</v>

1763
01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:16.740
<v Speaker 4>There's no database.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just go to as many places you want </v>

1764
01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:16.740
<v Speaker 4>as long as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come in,</v>

1765
01:18:16.740 --> 01:18:19.660
<v Speaker 4>scratching your fucking skin off with </v>
<v Speaker 4>blood coming out of your eyeballs.</v>

1766
01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:21.310
<v Speaker 4>They just move you onto the next.</v>

1767
01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:22.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think.</v>

1768
01:18:22.671 --> 01:18:24.670
<v Speaker 5>But even the cyber selling thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>

1769
01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.040
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you feel like your.</v>

1770
01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:31.180
<v Speaker 5>I just feel like we're locked into this </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing of like possession.</v>

1771
01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:35.430
<v Speaker 4>Well that's what would cure that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Big groups of mushroom uses.</v>

1772
01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:41.780
<v Speaker 4>Mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>users getting together and forming </v>

1773
01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:43.911
<v Speaker 4>communities of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can have a lot of people that have </v>

1774
01:18:43.911 --> 01:18:46.731
<v Speaker 4>had these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like changing these transforming love </v>

1775
01:18:46.731 --> 01:18:48.030
<v Speaker 4>experiences where when you do mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1776

<v Speaker 4>living around you in this,</v>

1778
01:18:54.061 --> 01:18:58.050
<v Speaker 4>this sense of this sense of a symbiosis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sense of uh,</v>

1779
01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:00.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>connection with everything.</v>

1780
01:19:00.181 --> 01:19:02.700
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's the molecules of the air,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the grass,</v>

1781
01:19:02.701 --> 01:19:03.940
<v Speaker 4>the trees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this,</v>

1782
01:19:03.941 --> 01:19:05.820
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this connection that you can't feel when</v>

1783
01:19:05.821 --> 01:19:10.821
<v Speaker 4>you're on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it could be completely an illusion </v>

1784
01:19:10.821 --> 01:19:11.700
<v Speaker 4>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but alcohol is completely illusion to.</v>

1785
01:19:11.701 --> 01:19:13.650
<v Speaker 4>And the culture of alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1786
01:19:13.651 --> 01:19:15.580
<v Speaker 4>Shapes in area and the culture of</v>

1787
01:19:15.610 --> 01:19:20.610
<v Speaker 5>it makes you hate everyone around you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Culture of silicide been with a graph </v>

1788
01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:24.991
<v Speaker 5>and would be the best thing for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for a society because that what alcohol </v>

1789
01:19:24.991 --> 01:19:25.090
<v Speaker 5>does to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it makes you angry.</v>

1790
01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:25.720
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it actually,</v>

1791
01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:27.310
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it just makes me sleepy.</v>

1792
01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:30.660
<v Speaker 5>It just may.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need energy and like I don't have a,</v>

1793
01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:33.940
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an excess of energy so I can't be like,</v>

1794
01:19:33.941 --> 01:19:36.840
<v Speaker 5>if I were going to do drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do cocaine or speed or something.</v>

1795
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:40.450
<v Speaker 5>I've never done any of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not do any drugs at all.</v>

1796
01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:42.910
<v Speaker 5>Nothing takes all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Often I would do shrimps.</v>

1797
01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:45.510
<v Speaker 4>Well you shouldn't do shrooms if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>take zoloft.</v>

1798
01:19:45.570 --> 01:19:50.570
<v Speaker 4>I believe that that's not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that you're not supposed to </v>

1799
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:50.570
<v Speaker 4>combine those two.</v>

1800
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:52.220
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I haven't in a long time.</v>

1801
01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:57.350
<v Speaker 5>So how long have you been on zoloft?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twelve year.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1803
01:19:59.330 --> 01:20:00.770

<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1804
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:05.600
<v Speaker 5>it makes me not want to cry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It makes me not like,</v>

1805
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:09.060
<v Speaker 5>it makes me just put paper over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mirrors.</v>

1806
01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:10.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's true.</v>

1807
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:10.770
<v Speaker 5>Nice one.</v>

1808
01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:14.660
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you hate?</v>

1809
01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:22.700
<v Speaker 5>Have you always been a sad person </v>
<v Speaker 5>growing up or did you just get a little </v>

1810
01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:22.700
<v Speaker 5>off after?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1811
01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:24.930
<v Speaker 5>I was always a sad person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever try anything?</v>

1812
01:20:24.931 --> 01:20:27.270
<v Speaker 5>Like a regular exercise like running?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1813
01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:28.400
<v Speaker 5>Did that help?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1814
01:20:28.530 --> 01:20:29.580
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it helps.</v>

1815
01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:32.070

<v Speaker 5>in the cocktail,</v>

1816
01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.010
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm better off exercising than </v>
<v Speaker 5>not.</v>

1817
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:37.320
<v Speaker 5>So it adds to it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>but I don't,</v>

1819
01:20:38.941 --> 01:20:43.380
<v Speaker 5>but if I took nothing and just exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just get real,</v>

1820
01:20:43.381 --> 01:20:44.130
<v Speaker 5>like low energy,</v>

1869
01:22:41.221 --> 01:22:41.530
<v Speaker 4>then if you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you put a little athletic tape over that</v>

<v Speaker 1>throwing punches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit's fucking difficult.</v>

<v Speaker 5>like doing shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1925
01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.130
<v Speaker 5>A worth guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They yell at each other though.</v>

1926
01:24:57.670 --> 01:24:58.690
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just in general,</v>

1927
01:24:58.710 --> 01:25:02.070
<v Speaker 1>mrs rogan goes to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a Bunch of caddy cons,</v>

1928
01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:06.290
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of these uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly name is the name of the chair and</v>

1929
01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.520
<v Speaker 1>the day hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah it is.</v>

1930
01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Look it up on yellow pages and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking yell over who gets what spot and</v>

1931
01:25:13.081 --> 01:25:15.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to steal the right spots,</v>

1932
01:25:15.570 --> 01:25:17.780
<v Speaker 1>the room and they yell at each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they throw kicks.</v>

1933
01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:23.990
<v Speaker 5>I have a theory that women would be </v>
<v Speaker 5>better off if they could punch each </v>

1934
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:25.620
<v Speaker 5>other in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All that like snapping and cattiness.</v>

1935
01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:27.540
<v Speaker 5>We'd go out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why guys aren't,</v>

1936
01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:31.500
<v Speaker 5>is cause we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause I know if I do it more than twice,</v>

1937
01:25:31.530 --> 01:25:36.000
<v Speaker 5>you're going to punch me and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there is nothing legislating women's</v>

1938
01:25:36.540 --> 01:25:39.030
<v Speaker 5>behavior that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is with guys.</v>

1939
01:25:39.031 --> 01:25:44.031
<v Speaker 5>I've had guys on the set of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of tv shows that I was in charge of.</v>

1940
01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:49.460
<v Speaker 5>There was a sound guy named charles who </v>
<v Speaker 5>I sort of snapped at one time and he </v>

1941
01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:49.980
<v Speaker 5>looked at me like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1942
01:25:49.981 --> 01:25:52.890
<v Speaker 5>I will fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I never snapped at him again.</v>

1943
01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:54.860
<v Speaker 5>It was one of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think it's like,</v>

1944
01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:57.440
<v Speaker 5>it's a good thing to checked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1945
01:25:57.450 --> 01:26:00.450
<v Speaker 5>It's just as long as you know it's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>possibility.</v>

1946
01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it helps regulate behavior.</v>

1947
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:09.130
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying that they ever should.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's always wrong to hit a </v>

1948
01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:09.130
<v Speaker 6>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>

1949
01:26:09.130 --> 01:26:10.220
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what regulates black chicks,</v>

1950
01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:14.440
<v Speaker 6>black chicks regulated video that I made</v>
<v Speaker 6>a video that I made in the.</v>

1951
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:17.170
<v Speaker 6>Where the fuck was in milwaukee.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a,</v>

1952
01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:22.180
<v Speaker 6>I did a show me walking afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just went out and took pictures of </v>

1953
01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:23.810
<v Speaker 6>people for an hour and a half and these </v>
<v Speaker 6>black chicks guarded me.</v>

1954
01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:29.020
<v Speaker 6>They put their back to the crowd and </v>
<v Speaker 6>like student a semicircle and created </v>

1955
01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:30.650
<v Speaker 6>this system where the people had to go </v>
<v Speaker 6>through them this way.</v>

1956
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:35.830
<v Speaker 6>And when you entered in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you entered in only from here and then </v>

1957
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.830
<v Speaker 6>you left only that way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was really funny.</v>

1958
01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:40.601
<v Speaker 6>They were hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I made a video with them afterwards </v>

1959
01:26:40.601 --> 01:26:41.720
<v Speaker 6>to my youtube.</v>

1962
01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:52.400
<v Speaker 6>It says something about joe rogan shows </v>
<v Speaker 6>love to the milwaukee something,</v>

1963
01:26:52.401 --> 01:26:55.970
<v Speaker 6>some stupid fucking some stupid title.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing you can do.</v>

1964
01:26:56.090 --> 01:27:01.090
<v Speaker 6>You just have to be stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did I tell you I'm going to be in </v>

1965
01:27:01.090 --> 01:27:03.131
<v Speaker 6>baltimore next week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are you going to be more comedy factory </v>

1966
01:27:07.791 --> 01:27:09.800
<v Speaker 6>guys?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is the baltimore common factor?</v>

1967
01:27:09.801 --> 01:27:11.510
<v Speaker 6>It's a new club,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe.</v>

1968
01:27:11.511 --> 01:27:14.840
<v Speaker 6>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because for awhile they only had the um,</v>

1969
01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:20.320
<v Speaker 6>they only had a in baltimore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had the improv in the improv went </v>

1970
01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:20.320
<v Speaker 6>under and I had never heard about </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything else.</v>

1971
01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:25.131
<v Speaker 6>I think it replaced the improv really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is the improv the one that you went to </v>

1972
01:27:25.131 --> 01:27:29.230
<v Speaker 6>like maybe nine years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We went a long time ago and it was like </v>

1973
01:27:29.230 --> 01:27:30.320
<v Speaker 6>a whole outdoor courtyard area with a </v>
<v Speaker 6>bunch of bars and stuff.</v>

1974
01:27:30.321 --> 01:27:31.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's exactly what.</v>

1975
01:27:31.170 --> 01:27:33.410
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that place was dope at the same place.</v>

1976
01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:35.300
<v Speaker 6>it's where the improv used to be.</v>

1977
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:37.460
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what a great spot.</v>

1978
01:27:37.461 --> 01:27:38.660
<v Speaker 6>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a great spot.</v>

1979
01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.000
<v Speaker 6>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's nice.</v>

1980
01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:41.240
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what is it called again?</v>

1981
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:44.050
<v Speaker 6>The comedy factory in baltimore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The baltimore county factor.</v>

1982
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:45.590
<v Speaker 6>And what days are you there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Eight.</v>

1983
01:27:45.690 --> 01:27:49.220
<v Speaker 6>Twenty five through eight slash 27,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is next thursday,</v>

1984
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:51.080
<v Speaker 6>friday,</v>
<v Speaker 6>saturday.</v>

1985
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:56.110
<v Speaker 6>Folks don't miss this tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 6>opportunity to see neil brennan.</v>

1986
01:27:56.900 --> 01:28:00.500
<v Speaker 6>I personally talk about capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't talk about my dick.</v>

1987
01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:04.130
<v Speaker 6>You can talk about the ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I will talk about politics.</v>

1988
01:28:04.210 --> 01:28:06.800
<v Speaker 6>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can argue with his socialist.</v>

1989
01:28:06.801 --> 01:28:10.610
<v Speaker 6>Ask in person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm noT sure that I spoke to him for all</v>

1990
01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:15.640
<v Speaker 6>his social ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it just seems like people don't like</v>

1991
01:28:15.651 --> 01:28:17.660
<v Speaker 6>it without thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I think,</v>

1992
01:28:17.661 --> 01:28:22.661
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you need to concentrate on </v>

1993
01:28:22.661 --> 01:28:22.661
<v Speaker 6>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what I think.</v>

1994
01:28:22.661 --> 01:28:22.661
<v Speaker 6>I think it's a very complex system.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very fucked up.</v>

1995
01:28:22.661 --> 01:28:23.000
<v Speaker 6>There's lot of things wrong with it.</v>

1996
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:24.320
<v Speaker 6>The big,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the big question.</v>

1997
01:28:24.321 --> 01:28:26.240
<v Speaker 6>The big key is how do you make yourself </v>
<v Speaker 6>happy?</v>

1998
01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:28.640
<v Speaker 6>Because nobody else has to figure it out</v>
<v Speaker 6>on their own as well.</v>

1999
01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.950
<v Speaker 6>And how you make yourself happy and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

2000
01:28:30.951 --> 01:28:35.951
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everyone has their own unique answer to </v>

2001
01:28:35.951 --> 01:28:38.051
<v Speaker 6>that question,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but how do you make all these other </v>

2002
01:28:38.051 --> 01:28:38.051
<v Speaker 6>people happy?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>

2003
01:28:38.051 --> 01:28:38.720
<v Speaker 6>I'm not so sure it's socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that would work at all.</v>

2004
01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:43.960
<v Speaker 6>I'm not so sure it's making everybody </v>
<v Speaker 6>get paid the same amount of money for </v>

2005
01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:43.960
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that would work either.</v>

2006
01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.790
<v Speaker 6>I think the reason why we have so much </v>
<v Speaker 6>cool shit because there's a god damn </v>

2007
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:49.520
<v Speaker 6>race going on as competition going on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some people rise to the occasion,</v>

2008
01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:54.750
<v Speaker 6>absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I feel like it's we punish those </v>

2009
01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:57.221
<v Speaker 6>that don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have to figure out individually how </v>

2010
01:28:57.221 --> 01:28:57.221
<v Speaker 6>to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what it is,</v>

2011
01:28:57.221 --> 01:29:01.810
<v Speaker 6>and we also have to figure out how to </v>
<v Speaker 6>keep corporations from being so fucking </v>

2012
01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:01.830
<v Speaker 6>corrupt and crooked that they are</v>

2013
01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:03.830
<v Speaker 1>able to get away with shit to get there.</v>

2014
01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:09.480
<v Speaker 5>Nothing's gonna stop because they're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The corporations themselves are buying </v>

2015
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:11.410
<v Speaker 5>messages saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't touch us.</v>

2016
01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:15.400
<v Speaker 5>We provide jobs and that's all you care </v>
<v Speaker 5>about and jobs will give you more.</v>

2017
01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're paying masses,</v>

2018
01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:22.420
<v Speaker 1>masses of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant sums of money to help politicians </v>

2019
01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:24.230
<v Speaker 1>tend to office lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lobbyists,</v>

2020
01:29:24.231 --> 01:29:26.600
<v Speaker 1>campaign contributions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The all of the above,</v>

2021
01:29:27.130 --> 01:29:30.780
<v Speaker 5>I believe that is a massive key is </v>
<v Speaker 5>campaign finance reform.</v>

2022
01:29:31.090 --> 01:29:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so scary that companies can just </v>

2023
01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:36.090
<v Speaker 1>buy presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

2024
01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:38.420
<v Speaker 1>They could just have us convinced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bump we got to get into Pakistan.</v>

2025
01:29:38.421 --> 01:29:40.850
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2026
01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:41.930
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we're there,</v>

2027
01:29:41.931 --> 01:29:44.390
<v Speaker 1>we just found trillions of dollars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>minerals.</v>

2028
01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're coming from.</v>

2029

<v Speaker 1>the biggest source of natural gas in the</v>

2031
01:29:50.241 --> 01:29:53.150
<v Speaker 1>world in Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We never even knew it was there folks.</v>

2032
01:29:53.490 --> 01:29:55.370

<v Speaker 1>we never knew it was their next stop.</v>

2033
01:29:55.371 --> 01:29:57.260
<v Speaker 1>The Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit going on the Congo</v>

2034
01:29:57.261 --> 01:30:00.520
<v Speaker 1>and we got to get a lot of unrest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to shut it down,</v>

2035
01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:03.620
<v Speaker 1>shut down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a shitload of minds.</v>

2036

<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

2037
01:30:06.681 --> 01:30:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Even the United States government is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2038

<v Speaker 1>but you can have that crazy part.</v>

2040
01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Is China going to war in the Congo?</v>

2041
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:19.660
<v Speaker 5>A lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In fact,</v>

2042
01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:23.140

<v Speaker 5>investments tonight.</v>

2049
01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:48.480
<v Speaker 5>They get it all from either the Congo or</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>or Nigeria.</v>

2051
01:30:50.141 --> 01:30:51.190
<v Speaker 5>just one of those dislikes.</v>

2052
01:30:51.230 --> 01:30:52.620
<v Speaker 1>The gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean petrol?</v>

2055
01:30:54.271 --> 01:30:56.650
<v Speaker 1>they're pumping it out of africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2056
01:30:57.020 --> 01:30:58.900
<v Speaker 5>And they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're buying,</v>

2057
01:30:58.901 --> 01:31:00.940
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like they'll pay both sides.</v>

2058
01:31:00.941 --> 01:31:01.460
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2059
01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:02.920
<v Speaker 5>they bought the government there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've,</v>

2060
01:31:03.410 --> 01:31:04.120
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2061
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:06.660
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2062
01:31:06.850 --> 01:31:11.850
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the thing is no one's gonna </v>

2063
01:31:11.850 --> 01:31:13.120
<v Speaker 5>do anything because it's way easier to </v>
<v Speaker 5>sit on your computer.</v>

2064
01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:18.360
<v Speaker 5>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a theory that that crime went </v>

2065
01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:20.671
<v Speaker 5>down when cable cable increased.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe that they are directly </v>

2066
01:31:20.671 --> 01:31:21.780
<v Speaker 5>correlated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't prove it in any way.</v>

2067
01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Giving people something to watch on tv </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes less crime.</v>

2068
01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Just people have shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I want to get in and</v>

<v Speaker 5>by inviting a girl over and all that </v>

2072
01:31:35.411 --> 01:31:38.800
<v Speaker 5>shit and having shit to do with her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like that's,</v>

2073
01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:42.030
<v Speaker 5>you will get a regular job just so if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you can,</v>

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:04.080
<v Speaker 5>It was where they said the reason crime </v>
<v Speaker 5>went down is because the crime started </v>

2081
01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:08.161
<v Speaker 5>going down in 91 and abortion was made </v>
<v Speaker 5>legal in a 73 basically saying all the </v>

<v Speaker 5>states legalize it sooner and those </v>
<v Speaker 5>states crime started dropping center to </v>

2106
01:33:15.671 --> 01:33:17.560
<v Speaker 1>When you can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a baby and it can exist outside the</v>

2107
01:33:17.561 --> 01:33:18.220
<v Speaker 1>womb.</v>

<v Speaker 5>As much as I don'T connect to it.</v>

2119
01:33:40.411 --> 01:33:43.660
<v Speaker 5>When it's a bunch of seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>drop it out.</v>

2120
01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:48.900
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't seem to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There are people that do believe that </v>

2121
01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:48.900
<v Speaker 5>you can connect to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>abortion clinic because I go in there.</v>

2131
01:34:18.890 --> 01:34:18.890
<v Speaker 5>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe.</v>

2132
01:34:19.230 --> 01:34:22.530
<v Speaker 5>No abortion clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nothing we can say.</v>

2133
01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:27.920
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was going to say I wish there was a </v>

2134
01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:28.470
<v Speaker 5>camera that you can like in like check </v>
<v Speaker 5>to see if it's like retarded.</v>

2135
01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:28.850
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>so it's not 100 percent now like you'll,</v>

2138
01:34:36.290 --> 01:34:38.620
<v Speaker 5>you'll know it's retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2139
01:34:39.170 --> 01:34:44.170
<v Speaker 5>they put it euphemistically,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is basically your child's going </v>

2140
01:34:44.170 --> 01:34:47.970
<v Speaker 5>to be a to say brain damage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>disabled,</v>

2141
01:34:47.971 --> 01:34:48.990
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and people,</v>

2142
01:34:49.290 --> 01:34:54.290
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people get abortions because </v>

2143
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:54.290
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>

2144
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the sole is supposed to enter the </v>

2145
01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:58.941
<v Speaker 1>body and 120th day of pregnancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the yogis believe that the pineal</v>

2146
01:35:00.111 --> 01:35:03.920
<v Speaker 1>gland comes from the hundred and 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>day 919.</v>

2147
01:35:03.921 --> 01:35:08.921
<v Speaker 1>So you can get rid of the baby before </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and it's just a like how it made </v>

2148
01:35:08.921 --> 01:35:11.260
<v Speaker 1>answers that the soul enters what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to the soul.</v>

2149
01:35:11.261 --> 01:35:16.261
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's got like a bus ticket </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it goes and it's on its way to the </v>

2150
01:35:16.261 --> 01:35:17.820
<v Speaker 1>baby's house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 20 days there.</v>

2151
01:35:17.850 --> 01:35:18.920
<v Speaker 1>It's got a suitcase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2152
01:35:18.921 --> 01:35:20.120
<v Speaker 1>hello?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here.</v>

2153
01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Where's the fucking baby?</v>

2154
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where's the soul?</v>

2155
01:35:23.761 --> 01:35:28.761
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it just go out and fart gun in the </v>

2156
01:35:28.761 --> 01:35:28.761
<v Speaker 5>air?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It goes away.</v>

2157
01:35:28.761 --> 01:35:30.110
<v Speaker 5>It goes back.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It goes back to the river souls.</v>

2158
01:35:30.490 --> 01:35:33.540
<v Speaker 5>Hopefully that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the uh,</v>

2159
01:35:33.570 --> 01:35:35.250
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like either you're for or against,</v>

2160
01:35:35.251 --> 01:35:36.030
<v Speaker 5>but all that stuff,</v>

2161
01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.970
<v Speaker 1>like not necessarily think either you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it or against it.</v>

2162
01:35:38.971 --> 01:35:43.971
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a rational argument that</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be said that after a certain </v>

2163
01:35:43.971 --> 01:35:44.010
<v Speaker 1>amount of time you shouldn't be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these late term,</v>

2168
01:35:56.060 --> 01:35:56.060
<v Speaker 5>I've ever seen.</v>

<v Speaker 5>lunatic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he made a two and a half hour </v>

<v Speaker 1>the ultra liberal amongst us will,</v>

2190
01:36:54.081 --> 01:36:57.430
<v Speaker 1>will never let you say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be bad.</v>

2191
01:36:57.550 --> 01:36:58.140
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's good.</v>

2192
01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:00.370
<v Speaker 5>The thing is I am liberal button.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I'm,</v>

2193
01:37:00.371 --> 01:37:01.180
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2194
01:37:01.210 --> 01:37:02.470
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those things where I just </v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

2195
01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:03.420
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2196
01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.750
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm for it.</v>

2197
01:37:04.751 --> 01:37:06.950
<v Speaker 5>But I'm not like for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe it should be allowed,</v>

2198
01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:10.780
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not on some like you fucking,</v>

2199
01:37:10.810 --> 01:37:11.900
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you had,</v>

2200
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:16.910
<v Speaker 5>you stand up as the best joke about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>where the people are for it in case of </v>

2201
01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.420
<v Speaker 5>incest or rape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

2202
01:37:19.421 --> 01:37:22.630
<v Speaker 5>so you're for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If the dad is an asshole,</v>

2203
01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:26.200
<v Speaker 5>that's what he's saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if the dad's an asshole then you're</v>

2204
01:37:26.201 --> 01:37:29.070
<v Speaker 5>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if the dads nice guy than your,</v>

2205
01:37:29.130 --> 01:37:31.450
<v Speaker 5>than your foot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But because it's just as much a life,</v>

2206
01:37:32.050 --> 01:37:33.750
<v Speaker 5>if the guy raped or insensitive,</v>

2207
01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:36.020
<v Speaker 1>the baby shouldn't be responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>its data.</v>

2208
01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:39.940
<v Speaker 1>And for the dad being a dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is an interesting way of looking at</v>

2209
01:37:39.941 --> 01:37:44.941
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You allow It under some circumstances </v>

2210
01:37:44.941 --> 01:37:47.161
<v Speaker 1>where you shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A man can't be forced to make a woman </v>

2211
01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:47.200
<v Speaker 1>carry the life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2212
01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing.</v>

2213
01:37:48.731 --> 01:37:53.731
<v Speaker 1>Like saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like some tribal shit that's not </v>

2214
01:37:53.731 --> 01:37:53.731
<v Speaker 1>very spiritual thinking that that's okay</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kill people.</v>

2215
01:37:53.731 --> 01:37:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2216
01:37:55.510 --> 01:37:55.860
<v Speaker 1>we met.</v>

2217
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:57.480
<v Speaker 5>Sorry baby.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2218
01:37:57.481 --> 01:37:58.860
<v Speaker 5>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you're just a baby.</v>

2219
01:37:58.861 --> 01:38:00.900
<v Speaker 5>But if you believe it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry,</v>

2220
01:38:00.901 --> 01:38:02.760
<v Speaker 5>fetus will go fetus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

2221
01:38:02.761 --> 01:38:05.460
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing is I was having watched</v>
<v Speaker 5>that documentary.</v>

2222
01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:08.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm still for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's a bit.</v>

2223
01:38:08.850 --> 01:38:10.080
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's my,</v>

2224
01:38:10.110 --> 01:38:14.330
<v Speaker 5>my point of view is way more shaded and </v>
<v Speaker 5>nuanced than,</v>

2225
01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:16.370
<v Speaker 5>than it would be than it was before I </v>
<v Speaker 5>saw the dog.</v>

2226
01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:19.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I have a right to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you can do with your body,</v>

2227
01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:22.220
<v Speaker 4>but I think it should be discussed when </v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets crazy.</v>

2228
01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:22.810
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2229
01:38:22.811 --> 01:38:27.811
<v Speaker 4>I have a buddy who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was dating a girl and she had a late </v>

2230
01:38:27.811 --> 01:38:31.190
<v Speaker 4>term abortion where she had to go to </v>
<v Speaker 4>some illegal place and do it.</v>

2231
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:36.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why they chose to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she was fucking pregnant and they </v>

2232
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.770
<v Speaker 4>killed that baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know that.</v>

2233
01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:38.480
<v Speaker 4>That freaked me out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

2234
01:38:38.490 --> 01:38:39.680
<v Speaker 4>Did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did your buddy think?</v>

2235
01:38:40.100 --> 01:38:43.710
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't talked to him in forever and I</v>

2236
01:38:43.711 --> 01:38:48.711
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried not to really question it than </v>

2237
01:38:48.711 --> 01:38:50.690
<v Speaker 4>if it was happening now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way I would not be able to,</v>

2238
01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:55.691
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back then it was 23 years old and I was </v>

2239
01:38:55.691 --> 01:38:58.061
<v Speaker 4>just like freaked out the front and this</v>
<v Speaker 4>lady was fucking pregnant and they're </v>

2240
01:38:58.061 --> 01:38:59.600
<v Speaker 4>going to suck that baby out of her and </v>
<v Speaker 4>some illegal place.</v>

2241
01:39:00.050 --> 01:39:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2242
01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:02.620
<v Speaker 4>that shit is that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2243
01:39:02.810 --> 01:39:04.460
<v Speaker 4>no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's evil.</v>

2244
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:09.550
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an you don't want to accept </v>

2245
01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:09.550
<v Speaker 4>reality at that point is what's going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

2246
01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:12.340
<v Speaker 4>You've decided to try to change reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there an out</v>

2247
01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:15.820
<v Speaker 5>that's one of those blind spots though </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we live with all the time.</v>

2248
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:17.830
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

2249
01:39:17.831 --> 01:39:19.930
<v Speaker 5>there's tons of things we do that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>just like,</v>

2250
01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:24.130
<v Speaker 5>that's pretty fucked up that you just </v>
<v Speaker 5>walk past homeless people.</v>

2251
01:39:24.131 --> 01:39:26.560
<v Speaker 5>You walk past poor people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you walk and you just go,</v>

2252
01:39:26.561 --> 01:39:27.180
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>

2253
01:39:27.550 --> 01:39:30.010
<v Speaker 4>The numbers are too great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there was only a few of us,</v>

2254
01:39:30.011 --> 01:39:31.090
<v Speaker 4>we wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2255
01:39:31.190 --> 01:39:36.190
<v Speaker 4>I've always said that people lived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should be in tribes have like 500 </v>

2256
01:39:36.190 --> 01:39:37.570
<v Speaker 4>monkey people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what we're supposed to be.</v>

2257
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:41.020
<v Speaker 4>500 tribes have a few hundred people </v>
<v Speaker 4>where we all know each other very well.</v>

2258
01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:42.190
<v Speaker 4>That's normal</v>

2259
01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:45.720
<v Speaker 5>and I believe that women would stay in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>raise the babies.</v>

2260
01:39:45.721 --> 01:39:50.721
<v Speaker 5>I honestly believe that the way </v>
<v Speaker 5>guerrilla style where it's like the </v>

2261
01:39:50.721 --> 01:39:51.000
<v Speaker 5>women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the women gorillas stay.</v>

2262
01:39:51.001 --> 01:39:56.001
<v Speaker 5>They want the babies in the guys just do</v>
<v Speaker 5>the parameter standup perimeter and </v>

2263
01:39:56.001 --> 01:39:57.720
<v Speaker 5>fight and fight and protect.</v>

2264
01:39:57.740 --> 01:39:58.730
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's always been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2265
01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's always been like that.</v>

2266
01:40:00.051 --> 01:40:05.051
<v Speaker 4>It's just we have that same genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now we're in these giant groups of </v>

2267
01:40:05.051 --> 01:40:08.381
<v Speaker 4>300 million people pushed together onto </v>
<v Speaker 4>this one continent and we're confused.</v>

2268
01:40:08.661 --> 01:40:13.661
<v Speaker 4>We're confused as to how to behave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have all these weird instincts to </v>

2269
01:40:13.661 --> 01:40:14.990
<v Speaker 4>fuck everything and kill your enemies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and everything,</v>

2270
01:40:14.991 --> 01:40:15.340
<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>

2271
01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:16.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you can't.</v>

2272
01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:17.710
<v Speaker 5>That's what I've been doing a joke </v>
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>

2273
01:40:17.711 --> 01:40:22.420
<v Speaker 5>Like they that it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>now we have to be romantic to get women,</v>

2274
01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:27.660
<v Speaker 5>but it used to be all we had to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>before it was just chased them down and </v>

2275
01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:31.771
<v Speaker 5>send to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a reason why men are stronger </v>

2276
01:40:31.771 --> 01:40:31.771
<v Speaker 5>than.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2277
01:40:31.771 --> 01:40:31.771
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

2278
01:40:31.771 --> 01:40:31.771
<v Speaker 5>That's what the are superior.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was it.</v>

2279
01:40:31.771 --> 01:40:32.890
<v Speaker 5>Like that was a date.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2280
01:40:33.070 --> 01:40:36.310
<v Speaker 5>Was just a chase was just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why chase scenes work in movies.</v>

2281
01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:41.530
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's why dirty girls like to get </v>

2282
01:40:41.530 --> 01:40:41.730
<v Speaker 5>fucking choked ad where the guy I got,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I gotta be honest.</v>

2283

<v Speaker 5>We talked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if we don't as last time.</v>

2284
01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:44.290
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2285
01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:47.620
<v Speaker 5>it's not just dirty girls anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

2286
01:40:47.621 --> 01:40:49.490
<v Speaker 5>You haven't been out in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>out,</v>

01:40:49.491 --> 01:40:52.100
<v Speaker 5>out since that real internet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Since you porn.</v>

2288

<v Speaker 5>I don't</v>

2289
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:57.720
<v Speaker 3>know if all of them do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of girls want to want to get.</v>

2290
01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:01.750
<v Speaker 3>I could trust me really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't know what</v>

2291
01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:03.960
<v Speaker 5>your experience has been,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's been a,</v>

2292
01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:06.370
<v Speaker 5>maybe it's my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my credits or something,</v>

2293
01:41:06.371 --> 01:41:10.390
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't take long for them to </v>
<v Speaker 5>bring it up.</v>

2294
01:41:10.670 --> 01:41:11.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never,</v>

2295
01:41:11.691 --> 01:41:13.580
<v Speaker 3>I wAsn't doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I.</v>

2296
01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:18.820
<v Speaker 3>And then I slowly but surely like when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying choke you mean grabbed </v>

2297
01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:21.821
<v Speaker 3>them physically by the neck and choke </v>
<v Speaker 3>them while I'm talking about in to </v>

2298
01:41:21.821 --> 01:41:26.080
<v Speaker 3>linkedin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not real choke unless you're </v>

2299
01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:26.080
<v Speaker 3>doing real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2300
01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:29.590
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do choke but it's more like I'm just </v>

2301
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:29.590
<v Speaker 3>zach just like,</v>

2305
01:41:39.811 --> 01:41:41.510
<v Speaker 3>So at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it might be your crowd though,</v>

2306
01:41:41.511 --> 01:41:46.511
<v Speaker 3>dude might be attracting a crowd is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>literate and fucking they liked hip hop.</v>

2307
01:41:47.721 --> 01:41:52.721
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who my credits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do imagine that I'm cool with </v>

2308
01:41:54.021 --> 01:41:55.700
<v Speaker 3>black label.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of them are white now.</v>

2309
01:41:55.730 --> 01:41:58.070
<v Speaker 3>You know what's funny is he ever look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>your crowd and go like,</v>

2310
01:41:58.100 --> 01:41:58.910
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>ReallY?</v>

2311
01:41:58.970 --> 01:41:59.780
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

2312
01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:00.740
<v Speaker 3>it's people that if you</v>

2313
01:42:00.990 --> 01:42:05.990
<v Speaker 5>by them on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you wouldn't think that I bet that </v>

2314
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:05.990
<v Speaker 5>person would like me</v>

2315
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.420
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2316
01:42:06.530 --> 01:42:07.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2317
01:42:07.031 --> 01:42:08.290
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't assume,</v>

2318
01:42:08.291 --> 01:42:13.291
<v Speaker 3>I assume that no one likes me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when people are there and eventually </v>

2319
01:42:13.291 --> 01:42:15.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when people are at the show,</v>

2320
01:42:15.881 --> 01:42:17.650

2321
01:42:17.651 --> 01:42:18.730

<v Speaker 3>How many months you've been doing the </v>

<v Speaker 3>like the hour?</v>

2326
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:28.920
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2327
01:42:29.130 --> 01:42:30.990
<v Speaker 5>I did it for a couple of weeks and now </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm back.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So are you enjoying this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

2330
01:42:36.861 --> 01:42:37.460
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

2331
01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:40.010
<v Speaker 5>saying it's like I just liked the idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

2332
01:42:40.130 --> 01:42:41.340
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of uh,</v>

2333
01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:42.080
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2334
01:42:42.081 --> 01:42:43.220
<v Speaker 5>what's funny is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you'll,</v>

2335
01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:48.250
<v Speaker 5>you may relate to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would assume that I'm way behind you </v>

2336
01:42:48.250 --> 01:42:51.121
<v Speaker 5>in terms of development standup wise,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where your feeling about the audience </v>

2337
01:42:51.740 --> 01:42:53.720
<v Speaker 5>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The more you do stand up.</v>

2338
01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:56.870
<v Speaker 5>I feel like the first thing you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do is just to overcome nerves,</v>

2339
01:42:57.260 --> 01:42:59.390
<v Speaker 5>which takes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It took me years.</v>

2340
01:42:59.450 --> 01:43:04.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it takes everyone using just </v>

2341
01:43:04.450 --> 01:43:04.450
<v Speaker 5>reps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>reps,</v>

2342
01:43:04.450 --> 01:43:04.450
<v Speaker 5>reps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>reps,</v>

2343
01:43:04.450 --> 01:43:04.450
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>kevin wants to.</v>

2345
01:43:05.011 --> 01:43:07.160
<v Speaker 5>My brother once said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2346
01:43:07.161 --> 01:43:12.161
<v Speaker 5>you're doing a lot of standup when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're comfortable onstage and </v>

2347
01:43:12.161 --> 01:43:13.730
<v Speaker 5>uncomfortable at the grocery store,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is fucking true.</v>

2348
01:43:13.731 --> 01:43:18.731
<v Speaker 5>Where you just do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing about the road is you do so </v>

2349
01:43:18.731 --> 01:43:19.010
<v Speaker 5>much standup that you dislike when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not doing it.</v>

2350
01:43:19.011 --> 01:43:20.300
<v Speaker 5>You're a little bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2351
01:43:20.301 --> 01:43:21.280
<v Speaker 5>what am I?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2352

<v Speaker 5>it should be doing standup.</v>

2353
01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:28.570
<v Speaker 5>So I finally got like not nervous and </v>
<v Speaker 5>from tHat your audience,</v>

2354
01:43:31.010 --> 01:43:33.680
<v Speaker 5>I'm no longer defensive against the </v>
<v Speaker 5>audience.</v>

2355
01:43:33.681 --> 01:43:37.640
<v Speaker 5>I know no longer see the audiences is </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing I'm keeping at bay,</v>

2356
01:43:37.970 --> 01:43:40.970
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I no longer seat is like elian that I've</v>

2357
01:43:40.971 --> 01:43:43.370
<v Speaker 5>got a whip and a chair and I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 5>keeping them back.</v>

2358
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:48.790
<v Speaker 5>Now I see it more like I'm immersed like</v>
<v Speaker 5>a diane fossey pit.</v>

2359
01:43:51.150 --> 01:43:51.910
<v Speaker 5>Like I'm,</v>

2361
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:56.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm like in the middle of the crowd and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like they won't overwhelm</v>

2362
01:43:56.350 --> 01:44:01.350
<v Speaker 1>that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you need to overwhelm them and </v>

2363
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:03.661
<v Speaker 1>control them and whipped them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically the same feeling that </v>

2364
01:44:03.661 --> 01:44:05.740
<v Speaker 1>unattractive men have towards women when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're unsuccessful.</v>

2365
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2366
01:44:06.490 --> 01:44:11.490
<v Speaker 1>that anger that may have towards women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of comedians have that angle </v>

2367
01:44:11.490 --> 01:44:11.860
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2368
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:13.830
<v Speaker 1>Because of the constant rejection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2369
01:44:13.831 --> 01:44:18.831
<v Speaker 1>Or just say almost like fuck fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>people fucking just fucking people and </v>

2370
01:44:18.831 --> 01:44:18.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's.</v>

2371
01:44:18.831 --> 01:44:19.030
<v Speaker 1>And the audience can smell it on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2372
01:44:19.031 --> 01:44:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

2373
01:44:20.051 --> 01:44:21.100
<v Speaker 1>And so can women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2374
01:44:21.101 --> 01:44:23.260
<v Speaker 1>a guy coming to buy a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No fucking lesbian.</v>

2375
01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:25.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tony Montana,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the other side,</v>

2377
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:29.980
<v Speaker 1>it's always the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's.</v>

2378
01:44:30.150 --> 01:44:32.910
<v Speaker 3>And that's the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like some girl said like,</v>

2380
01:44:37.831 --> 01:44:42.831
<v Speaker 3>to talk to a girl and it's like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you have to stop looking at it </v>

2381
01:44:42.831 --> 01:44:46.310
<v Speaker 3>as a buyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a seller and you have to look at it </v>

2382
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:49.731
<v Speaker 3>as a buyer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's in some ways I've stopped being </v>

2383
01:44:49.731 --> 01:44:49.731
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

01:46:14.401 --> 01:46:18.810
<v Speaker 3>but so right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so right now I say I'm a comedian,</v>

2418
01:46:18.811 --> 01:46:21.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm in comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then just leave it like that.</v>

2419
01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:22.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you</v>

2420
01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:27.540
<v Speaker 1>got this ace in your sleeve that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to pull out and want to pull out </v>

2421
01:46:27.540 --> 01:46:27.550
<v Speaker 1>that chappelle show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How it,</v>

2422
01:46:28.630 --> 01:46:31.000
<v Speaker 1>how long do you wait?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really all depends.</v>

2423
01:46:31.001 --> 01:46:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Like if it's going well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even pull it out for a while.</v>

2424
01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:34.840
<v Speaker 1>It's going well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2425
01:46:34.841 --> 01:46:35.650
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sit on it.</v>

2426
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

2427
01:46:37.751 --> 01:46:41.140
<v Speaker 1>The old fashion way back again with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my own hands.</v>

2428
01:46:41.141 --> 01:46:43.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't get enough credits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get it just by being a community,</v>

2429
01:46:43.271 --> 01:46:48.160
<v Speaker 1>but if she gets a little slippery was on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a buddy of mine.</v>

2430
01:46:48.630 --> 01:46:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it that way.</v>

2431
01:46:49.861 --> 01:46:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Dia</v>

2432
01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:53.590
<v Speaker 5>a tropic casually at the olive garden or</v>
<v Speaker 5>so.</v>

2433
01:46:53.591 --> 01:46:55.520
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't say I created the bullshit.</v>

2434
01:46:55.530 --> 01:46:57.920
<v Speaker 5>You just lose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You mentioned garden every episode,</v>

2435
01:46:57.921 --> 01:46:59.550
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it's the most generic restaurant</v>

2436
01:46:59.551 --> 01:47:00.780
<v Speaker 5>I can think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you always mentioned.</v>

2437
01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:04.020
<v Speaker 5>I'll start saying chili's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't just say,</v>

2438
01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:06.840
<v Speaker 5>you have to say a buddy of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't say like,</v>

2439
01:47:07.110 --> 01:47:09.390
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was directing,</v>

2440
01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.820
<v Speaker 5>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't name it,</v>

2441
01:47:11.821 --> 01:47:13.360
<v Speaker 5>you have to go up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>but buddy mine,</v>

2442
01:47:13.370 --> 01:47:16.680
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I worked on the show and did a chappelle</v>

2443
01:47:16.681 --> 01:47:21.681
<v Speaker 5>show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My favorite is when I go to open mics </v>

2444
01:47:21.681 --> 01:47:22.110
<v Speaker 5>that people don't know me and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you want me to say?</v>

2445
01:47:22.650 --> 01:47:23.740
<v Speaker 5>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2446
01:47:24.190 --> 01:47:25.350
<v Speaker 5>particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it used to happen a lot.</v>

2447
01:47:25.351 --> 01:47:27.720
<v Speaker 5>I go and cook inch belsher and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

2448
01:47:29.370 --> 01:47:32.060
<v Speaker 5>That would be good to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2449
01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:34.950
<v Speaker 5>And then they would go because they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a,</v>

2450
01:47:35.210 --> 01:47:38.820
<v Speaker 5>I used to call it the atomic credit </v>
<v Speaker 5>because it is one of the things like,</v>

2451
01:47:38.850 --> 01:47:41.490
<v Speaker 5>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take put that thing away.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how about a fucking.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Did you feel like that that was a lot of</v>

2454
01:47:46.261 --> 01:47:48.550
<v Speaker 5>responsibility to live up to when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>first started doing stem?</v>

2455
01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:48.870
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>My brother kevin was slamming me that </v>

<v Speaker 5>elbowing each other and wow.</v>

2463
01:48:07.690 --> 01:48:12.690
<v Speaker 5>Petition of 10.</v>

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2467

<v Speaker 5>kind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2468
01:48:18.630 --> 01:48:23.630
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing that you have all these </v>

2469
01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:23.630
<v Speaker 5>hippie ideals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dad on smoking with us.</v>

2470
01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:23.630
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2471
01:48:23.630 --> 01:48:25.590
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then we all competed with six guys.</v>

2472
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:28.500
<v Speaker 5>There were five brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

2473
01:48:28.501 --> 01:48:29.400
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

2474
01:48:29.401 --> 01:48:33.870
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't bombing as the creator </v>
<v Speaker 5>chappelle show was worse than bombing as</v>

2475
01:48:33.871 --> 01:48:37.590
<v Speaker 5>an anonymous guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got to think a pressure on you.</v>

2476
01:48:37.591 --> 01:48:38.500
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm asking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2477
01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:39.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was absolutely pressure.</v>

2478
01:48:39.810 --> 01:48:41.970
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't like conscious of it,</v>

2479
01:48:42.390 --> 01:48:45.960
<v Speaker 5>but looking back it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was definitely pressure,</v>

2480
01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:51.200
<v Speaker 5>but that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's what's nice to be in a place </v>

2481
01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:51.630
<v Speaker 5>where it's just more like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>

2482
01:48:51.631 --> 01:48:53.430
<v Speaker 5>the is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just have,</v>

2483
01:48:53.850 --> 01:48:58.850
<v Speaker 5>it's like the robin landing on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>shoulder and fucking I'm now I'm a </v>

2484
01:48:58.850 --> 01:49:00.830
<v Speaker 5>chimney sweep from mary poppins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's who you are.</v>

2485
01:49:00.900 --> 01:49:02.730
<v Speaker 5>That's who I am to the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2486
01:49:02.750 --> 01:49:04.500
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've done,</v>

2487
01:49:04.530 --> 01:49:09.530
<v Speaker 5>you've started doing your own podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you noticed immediately and impact </v>

2488
01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:10.330
<v Speaker 5>and like they podcast fans are coming to</v>
<v Speaker 5>you?</v>

2489
01:49:10.650 --> 01:49:12.510
<v Speaker 5>Not Immediately because we've only done </v>
<v Speaker 5>two.</v>

2490
01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:16.080
<v Speaker 5>Our third one will go up this up now I </v>
<v Speaker 5>think called the champs.</v>

2491
01:49:16.590 --> 01:49:18.840
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they,</v>

2492
01:49:18.930 --> 01:49:19.650
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2493
01:49:19.651 --> 01:49:20.630
<v Speaker 5>it hasn't happened yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

2494
01:49:20.670 --> 01:49:25.290
<v Speaker 5>but I believe it will like it because I </v>
<v Speaker 5>see just look if if 10,000</v>

2495
01:49:25.291 --> 01:49:30.291
<v Speaker 5>people listen to it then that's 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that I either sort of knew me or </v>

2496
01:49:31.081 --> 01:49:32.340
<v Speaker 5>didn't know me or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

2497
01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:37.050
<v Speaker 5>or knew me and will now feel more </v>
<v Speaker 5>connected because I think that's the new</v>

2498
01:49:37.051 --> 01:49:41.790
<v Speaker 5>paradigm is the just feeding people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just constant feeding.</v>

2499
01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:44.490
<v Speaker 5>Like here you go baby,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are you still hungry baby babies,</v>

2500
01:49:44.491 --> 01:49:46.370
<v Speaker 5>the audience in this metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're just.</v>

2501
01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:49.990
<v Speaker 5>And particularly you give them free </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff and that eventually go,</v>

2502
01:49:49.991 --> 01:49:50.650
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just so you know,</v>

2503
01:49:50.651 --> 01:49:53.260
<v Speaker 5>I got to charge every once in a while.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you know,</v>

2504
01:49:53.261 --> 01:49:56.350
<v Speaker 5>listen to this ad or it's like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>little wayne paradigm.</v>

2505
01:49:56.351 --> 01:50:01.351
<v Speaker 5>Little wayne put out four records that </v>
<v Speaker 5>he just mixed tapes and the and they're </v>

2506
01:50:01.541 --> 01:50:03.520
<v Speaker 5>good and they're really good songs.</v>

2507
01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:08.700
<v Speaker 5>And he just released him on the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then when he came up with his </v>

2508
01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:09.700
<v Speaker 5>record,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the carter it people bought it.</v>

2509
01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:14.840
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's the last guy to sell a million </v>

2510
01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:14.840
<v Speaker 5>records in a week because I think people</v>
<v Speaker 5>were like,</v>

2511
01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:19.260
<v Speaker 5>I don't think if people implicitly knew </v>
<v Speaker 5>that that's what they're explicitly </v>

2512
01:50:19.260 --> 01:50:19.570
<v Speaker 5>knew,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that that's what they were doing,</v>

2513
01:50:19.571 --> 01:50:21.430
<v Speaker 5>but I believe that people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

2514
01:50:21.431 --> 01:50:23.950
<v Speaker 5>I've gotten so many of these guys songs </v>
<v Speaker 5>for free.</v>

2515
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:26.680
<v Speaker 5>LeT me pay for a couple of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2516
01:50:26.681 --> 01:50:31.681
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I definitely felt like that was </v>

2517
01:50:31.681 --> 01:50:32.740
<v Speaker 5>my point of view on it and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the new with this democratization</v>

2518
01:50:32.741 --> 01:50:33.640
<v Speaker 5>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2519
01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:38.660
<v Speaker 5>it's free like it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The startup cost for thIs aren't </v>

2520
01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:39.580
<v Speaker 5>massive,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there there's something and then you</v>

2521
01:50:39.581 --> 01:50:43.240
<v Speaker 5>give it to people and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're exchanging ideas and,</v>

2522
01:50:43.330 --> 01:50:47.560
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and human energy for their time and then</v>

2523
01:50:47.561 --> 01:50:48.910
<v Speaker 5>hopefully they develop a connection with</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2524
01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:52.440
<v Speaker 1>You know what I noticed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very sterile way of looking at it,</v>

2525
01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:54.120
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a human.</v>

2526
01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I've noticed.</v>

2527
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:59.750
<v Speaker 5>I've noticed when I was on your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people came and were like,</v>

2528
01:50:59.751 --> 01:51:04.751
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard you and I didn't know who you </v>

2529
01:51:04.751 --> 01:51:06.221
<v Speaker 5>were.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know what you were about and </v>

2530
01:51:06.221 --> 01:51:06.221
<v Speaker 5>then because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I,</v>

2531
01:51:06.221 --> 01:51:07.100
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so yes,</v>

2532
01:51:07.101 --> 01:51:08.540
<v Speaker 5>to answer your question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people have come up,</v>

2533
01:51:08.541 --> 01:51:09.830
<v Speaker 5>but not because of my podcast,</v>

2534
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:15.070
<v Speaker 1>because of your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're saying makes a lot </v>

2535
01:51:15.070 --> 01:51:18.971
<v Speaker 1>of sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it makes it seem like you're </v>

2536
01:51:18.971 --> 01:51:19.600
<v Speaker 1>analyzing it like the stock market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that connection.</v>

2537
01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:21.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm only analyzing it in retrospect</v>

2538
01:51:21.810 --> 01:51:23.580
<v Speaker 5>cause I didn't because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2539
01:51:23.770 --> 01:51:28.770
<v Speaker 5>I do twitter because I've always liked </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking and little aphorisms like that </v>

2540
01:51:28.770 --> 01:51:29.410
<v Speaker 5>and then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh.</v>

2541
01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:30.670
<v Speaker 5>Then I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2542
01:51:30.671 --> 01:51:35.671
<v Speaker 5>I get what this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get this model and I've only gotten </v>

2543
01:51:35.671 --> 01:51:38.641
<v Speaker 5>him really since.</v>
<v Speaker 5>DoIng your podcast is like where you </v>

2544
01:51:38.641 --> 01:51:39.550
<v Speaker 5>said you've never had a connection like </v>
<v Speaker 5>this with the audience.</v>

2545
01:51:40.030 --> 01:51:43.780
<v Speaker 5>It's a connection and to get rid of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>gatekeeper to get rid of a studio,</v>

2546
01:51:43.781 --> 01:51:45.160
<v Speaker 5>to get rid of a television network.</v>

2547
01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is excellent.</v>

2548
01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:50.310
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing to be able to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

2549
01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:55.520
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this podcast has changed everything as </v>

2550
01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:57.981
<v Speaker 1>far as me doing comedy clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I do very little publicity outside </v>

2551
01:51:57.981 --> 01:52:02.571
<v Speaker 1>of just talking about it on the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>club or just talking about it rather on </v>

2552
01:52:02.571 --> 01:52:04.160
<v Speaker 1>the podcast and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything has changed.</v>

2553
01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:06.690
<v Speaker 1>The numbers of people that come out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see me has changed.</v>

2554
01:52:06.691 --> 01:52:11.691
<v Speaker 1>The ease of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I no longer have to fly in a day early </v>

2555
01:52:11.691 --> 01:52:13.110
<v Speaker 1>and do running radio things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's way easier now.</v>

2556
01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's.</v>

2557
01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:18.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's just from basically giving </v>
<v Speaker 1>something for free,</v>

2558
01:52:18.260 --> 01:52:18.800
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2559
01:52:18.801 --> 01:52:23.801
<v Speaker 1>you're friends with these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know them and you're </v>

2560
01:52:23.801 --> 01:52:25.941
<v Speaker 1>friends with them and they start </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking like you guys think and going </v>

2561
01:52:25.941 --> 01:52:29.571
<v Speaker 1>over the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideas that get discussed on the </v>

2562
01:52:29.571 --> 01:52:29.571
<v Speaker 1>podcast and talk about amongst their </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends and all these good ideas.</v>

2563
01:52:29.571 --> 01:52:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Blossom and grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2564
01:52:31.260 --> 01:52:33.220
<v Speaker 5>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the thing of it.</v>

2565
01:52:33.221 --> 01:52:36.630
<v Speaker 5>You do give it for free and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's not.</v>

2566
01:52:36.631 --> 01:52:38.100
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about the connection.</v>

2567
01:52:38.101 --> 01:52:39.450
<v Speaker 5>It's just like I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>

2568

2570
01:52:43.261 --> 01:52:46.220

<v Speaker 5>relatively</v>

2571
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:47.210
<v Speaker 1>funny way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

2572
01:52:47.450 --> 01:52:52.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people could benefit from </v>

2573
01:52:52.450 --> 01:52:54.530
<v Speaker 1>hearing me speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People will enjoy it for sure.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

2576
01:52:56.151 --> 01:52:58.250
<v Speaker 3>people really enjoyed the last one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was here last time.</v>

2577
01:52:58.290 --> 01:53:02.000
<v Speaker 3>You need some marijuana in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kid brand,</v>

2578
01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:07.680
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Abby did the thing about you being </v>

2579

<v Speaker 3>really tired and stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2580
01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:07.680
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2581
01:53:07.800 --> 01:53:12.800
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have that too where I'm just a zero </v>

2582
01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:15.401
<v Speaker 3>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm super tired most of the time I'm </v>

2583
01:53:15.401 --> 01:53:15.980
<v Speaker 3>either depressed or sad or like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2584
01:53:15.981 --> 01:53:17.610
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

2585
01:53:17.810 --> 01:53:19.330
<v Speaker 3>but lately I've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2586
01:53:19.370 --> 01:53:21.330
<v Speaker 3>having a good time in my personal life </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2587
01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:23.660
<v Speaker 3>that all magically just disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like went away.</v>

2588
01:53:23.661 --> 01:53:26.600
<v Speaker 3>I've never done any kind of zoned off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never done kind of any prescription</v>

2589
01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:28.280
<v Speaker 3>management.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always been the type of person that</v>

2590
01:53:28.281 --> 01:53:30.940
<v Speaker 3>needs it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if there's anything that I would say</v>

2591
01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:35.960
<v Speaker 3>would help me get through everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana definitely has just helped me </v>

2592
01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:40.120
<v Speaker 3>tremendously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has a built in self promotion </v>

2593
01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:42.971
<v Speaker 3>mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is not a drug in the world that </v>

2594
01:53:42.971 --> 01:53:46.211
<v Speaker 3>when you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that you talk about more drug in </v>

2595
01:53:46.211 --> 01:53:46.450
<v Speaker 3>the world is more beneficial in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>daily business.</v>

2596
01:53:46.630 --> 01:53:51.630
<v Speaker 3>Exactly what people have tylenol and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they talk about topics like a mild </v>

2597
01:53:51.630 --> 01:53:51.630
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic.</v>

2598
01:53:51.630 --> 01:53:52.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like a psychedelic digging use all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

2599
01:53:52.450 --> 01:53:54.610
<v Speaker 1>You can't do mushrooms every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can,</v>

2600
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:57.280
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to fucking lose your </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection to humanity.</v>

2601
01:53:57.830 --> 01:54:00.700
<v Speaker 1>You could smoke pot everyday and it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes you more empathetic.</v>

2602
01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:02.440
<v Speaker 1>It makes you more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more real,</v>

2603
01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:06.040
<v Speaker 1>makes you connect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connect to your real emotions better.</v>

2604
01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:07.630
<v Speaker 1>The way you interact wIth people</v>

2605
01:54:07.890 --> 01:54:12.890
<v Speaker 3>takes away headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I'd like to be as sharp as possible,</v>

2606
01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:15.960
<v Speaker 3>I like my brain to function well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't fuck with your function.</v>

2607
01:54:15.961 --> 01:54:18.640
<v Speaker 3>The brain it has in the past and getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wrong leads on.</v>

2608

2645
01:55:44.190 --> 01:55:45.000
<v Speaker 6>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't do it.</v>

2646
01:55:45.001 --> 01:55:46.520
<v Speaker 6>So he stomped on it and he was already </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2647
01:55:46.530 --> 01:55:48.720
<v Speaker 6>thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I to a fucking started smoking again.</v>

2648
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:50.370
<v Speaker 6>Three hours later he did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2649
01:55:50.371 --> 01:55:53.550
<v Speaker 6>If I smelled smoke $10,000,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is that?</v>

2650
01:55:54.230 --> 01:55:57.570
<v Speaker 6>It's the most addictive product on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>market.</v>

2651
01:55:59.100 --> 01:56:04.100
<v Speaker 6>Apparently though I know a dude who did </v>
<v Speaker 6>heroin who says that you can go fuck </v>

2652
01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:07.401
<v Speaker 6>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And everybody that says that it's tough </v>

2653
01:56:07.401 --> 01:56:07.401
<v Speaker 6>to quit cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

2654
01:56:07.401 --> 01:56:07.401
<v Speaker 6>heroin is way harder to quit than </v>
<v Speaker 6>cigarettes.</v>

2655
01:56:07.401 --> 01:56:09.120
<v Speaker 6>And people always say quitting </v>
<v Speaker 6>cigarettes is,</v>

2656
01:56:09.121 --> 01:56:11.700
<v Speaker 6>were harder than quitting heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely untrue.</v>

2657
01:56:11.701 --> 01:56:13.650
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>heroin is way harder.</v>

2658
01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:14.820
<v Speaker 6>It is harder.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But.</v>

2659
01:56:14.850 --> 01:56:17.580
<v Speaker 6>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I believe from person person.</v>

2660
01:56:17.581 --> 01:56:18.510
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure it's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2661
01:56:18.511 --> 01:56:21.180
<v Speaker 6>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't find quitting that hard.</v>

2662
01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:24.630
<v Speaker 6>I just decided.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you still it still scratching?</v>

2663
01:56:24.810 --> 01:56:26.430
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I still worry about,</v>

2664
01:56:26.670 --> 01:56:29.490
<v Speaker 5>about just getting into doing it again.</v>

2665
01:56:29.690 --> 01:56:32.800
<v Speaker 6>Is there any greater evidence that this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2666
01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:35.480
<v Speaker 6>the politicians are bought and paid for </v>
<v Speaker 6>then tobacco?</v>

2667
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:37.100
<v Speaker 6>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that's what I mean.</v>

2668
01:56:37.101 --> 01:56:40.810
<v Speaker 6>It's like with the fact that they knew </v>
<v Speaker 6>it was unhealthy and fifties and sixties</v>

2669
01:56:40.850 --> 01:56:44.840
<v Speaker 6>and it took 40 more years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My doctor recommends chesterfield.</v>

2670
01:56:45.170 --> 01:56:47.900
<v Speaker 6>absolutely took them 40 years to get it.</v>

2671
01:56:48.290 --> 01:56:49.930
<v Speaker 5>Only to the point where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>alright,</v>

2672
01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:55.000
<v Speaker 5>you can sell them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're going to tack them at such a </v>

2673
01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:55.000
<v Speaker 5>high rate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's going to.</v>

2674
01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.050
<v Speaker 5>We're gonna tax them at a cartoonishly </v>
<v Speaker 5>irate.</v>

2675
01:56:56.190 --> 01:57:00.670
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing too that some people have </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually sued for damage.</v>

2676
01:57:00.930 --> 01:57:05.930
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they've sued the tobacco companies in </v>

2677
01:57:05.930 --> 01:57:05.930
<v Speaker 6>one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2678
01:57:05.930 --> 01:57:05.930
<v Speaker 6>there's been some big handouts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2679
01:57:05.930 --> 01:57:07.920
<v Speaker 6>so people have to figure out who gets </v>
<v Speaker 6>paid,</v>

2680
01:57:07.921 --> 01:57:09.030
<v Speaker 6>who doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how can they,</v>

2681
01:57:09.060 --> 01:57:14.060
<v Speaker 6>how many suits can they allow?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How many lawsuits really can be </v>

2682
01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:17.121
<v Speaker 6>processed against tobacco companies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a fucking half a million people </v>

2683
01:57:17.121 --> 01:57:19.070
<v Speaker 6>every year dying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>5 million worldwide,</v>

2684
01:57:19.110 --> 01:57:22.040
<v Speaker 6>died prematurely directly as it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2685
01:57:22.420 --> 01:57:27.420
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm less interested in that and more </v>

2686
01:57:27.420 --> 01:57:29.281
<v Speaker 5>interested in obesity in terms of in </v>
<v Speaker 5>terms of the next terms of draining </v>

2687
01:57:30.101 --> 01:57:31.810
<v Speaker 5>society,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's where you go,</v>

2688
01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:35.650
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't legislate people's diets.</v>

2689
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.550
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2690
01:57:36.551 --> 01:57:40.000
<v Speaker 5>but it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's basically a seatbelt laws iF,</v>

2691
01:57:40.030 --> 01:57:41.200
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

2692
01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:46.260
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to eat yourself into </v>

2693
01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:47.080
<v Speaker 5>obesity and then you're going to drain </v>
<v Speaker 5>the healthcare system,</v>

2694
01:57:47.081 --> 01:57:48.130
<v Speaker 5>you're gonna drive up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>MY,</v>

2695
01:57:48.190 --> 01:57:49.960
<v Speaker 5>my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cost of my healthcare,</v>

2696
01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:55.200
<v Speaker 5>the cost of the government.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that was a lot of the stuff with </v>

2697
01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:58.410
<v Speaker 5>the tobacco industry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had to pay states because states </v>

2698
01:57:58.410 --> 01:58:01.021
<v Speaker 5>were fucking paying so much money to </v>
<v Speaker 5>treat people with lung cancer that you </v>

2699
01:58:01.021 --> 01:58:01.420
<v Speaker 5>kind of go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2700
01:58:01.421 --> 01:58:03.610
<v Speaker 5>well then what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's got to be next.</v>

2701
01:58:03.970 --> 01:58:08.970
<v Speaker 5>That's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got an outlaw or tax cocacola or </v>

2702
01:58:08.970 --> 01:58:10.180
<v Speaker 5>tax frito lay in it.</v>

2703
01:58:10.770 --> 01:58:15.770
<v Speaker 6>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because it's the only people that abuse </v>

2704
01:58:15.770 --> 01:58:18.071
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say that's way more ridiculous </v>

2705
01:58:18.071 --> 01:58:18.290
<v Speaker 6>than taxing tobacco because look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the other day I was in a supermarket and</v>

2706
01:58:18.291 --> 01:58:23.291
<v Speaker 6>for a goof I picked up a box of lucky </v>
<v Speaker 6>charms and I took them home and I had a </v>

2707
01:58:23.291 --> 01:58:23.690
<v Speaker 6>bowl of lucky charms.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2708
01:58:23.691 --> 01:58:25.100
<v Speaker 6>it was yummy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know what?</v>

2709
01:58:25.101 --> 01:58:26.630
<v Speaker 6>I eat healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I eat healthy,</v>

2710
01:58:26.631 --> 01:58:31.631
<v Speaker 6>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I reserve my own personal right to eat </v>

2711
01:58:31.631 --> 01:58:35.711
<v Speaker 6>something shitty every now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't mean that shitty food should </v>

2712
01:58:35.711 --> 01:58:38.690
<v Speaker 6>be illegal because you're too stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Incorrect because physical,</v>

2713
01:58:38.691 --> 01:58:42.640
<v Speaker 6>the physical addiction of cigarettes is </v>
<v Speaker 6>far more pulling.</v>

2714
01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:45.120
<v Speaker 6>Then the addiction to sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sugar is like,</v>

2715
01:58:45.450 --> 01:58:47.650
<v Speaker 6>that's a psychological addiction more </v>
<v Speaker 6>than anything.</v>

2716
01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:49.900
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you do admit that conviction.</v>

2717
01:58:49.901 --> 01:58:53.170
<v Speaker 6>Do you notice in your personal alignment</v>
<v Speaker 6>when she'll turn your email?</v>

2718
01:58:53.171 --> 01:58:53.860
<v Speaker 6>It can be an addiction.</v>

2719
01:58:53.890 --> 01:58:56.170
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe that's an addiction.</v>

2720
01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:58.900
<v Speaker 6>I believe I am an addict.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe on the computer addict.</v>

2721
01:58:58.930 --> 01:59:03.930
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I want someone to tax seen people </v>

2722
01:59:03.930 --> 01:59:06.481
<v Speaker 6>that cAn't stop texting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The kids stop texting him out of where </v>

2723
01:59:06.481 --> 01:59:06.481
<v Speaker 6>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There.</v>

2724
01:59:06.481 --> 01:59:09.170
<v Speaker 6>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I heard a story the other day that a </v>

2725
01:59:09.170 --> 01:59:10.360
<v Speaker 6>couple in Korea they met online in some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2726
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:14.380
<v Speaker 6>world war craft kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They met in person,</v>

2727
01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:18.370
<v Speaker 6>had a baby and then just kept going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>these,</v>

2728
01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:21.900
<v Speaker 6>these cafes and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they had,</v>

2729
01:59:21.910 --> 01:59:23.470
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in their online world,</v>

2730
01:59:23.471 --> 01:59:28.471
<v Speaker 6>they had a child together and they came </v>
<v Speaker 6>home one night and the baby had died </v>

2731
01:59:28.471 --> 01:59:33.031
<v Speaker 6>from their real baby had died from </v>
<v Speaker 6>starvation because they were so hooked </v>

2732
01:59:33.031 --> 01:59:36.970
<v Speaker 6>on the internet that they're idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That doesn't mean the internet,</v>

2733
01:59:36.971 --> 01:59:38.890
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it should be illegal,</v>

2734
01:59:38.891 --> 01:59:42.040
<v Speaker 6>but I'm saying there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not saying the difference between</v>

2735
01:59:42.041 --> 01:59:42.300
<v Speaker 6>shoe.</v>

2736
01:59:42.340 --> 01:59:43.000
<v Speaker 6>You can just go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2737
01:59:43.001 --> 01:59:46.170
<v Speaker 6>sugar is a way more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People are obese that are,</v>

2738
01:59:46.190 --> 01:59:48.430
<v Speaker 6>that are nice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I like snickers bars.</v>

2739
01:59:48.431 --> 01:59:51.490
<v Speaker 6>I liked sneakers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you're bright,</v>

2740
01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:54.670
<v Speaker 6>you're just going to get taxed for it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm willing to pay the tax,</v>

2741
01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:57.730
<v Speaker 6>then you're going to pay a much larger </v>
<v Speaker 6>tax.</v>

2742
01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:02.010
<v Speaker 6>But that doesn't cure anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's resolve any of the problems.</v>

2743
02:00:02.050 --> 02:00:04.390
<v Speaker 6>People have quit smoking by 40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Smoking.</v>

2744
02:00:04.391 --> 02:00:08.140
<v Speaker 6>Smoking is fucking way down from when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from 20 years ago.</v>

2745
02:00:08.170 --> 02:00:09.880
<v Speaker 6>really 40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's pretty high.</v>

2746
02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:11.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and particularly among teenagers.</v>

2747
02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:12.380
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2748
02:00:12.420 --> 02:00:13.750
<v Speaker 6>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a good start.</v>

2749
02:00:13.870 --> 02:00:18.870
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what I mean like it is when they </v>

2750
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.870
<v Speaker 6>go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't legislate.</v>

2751
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.940
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can.</v>

2752
02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:21.340
<v Speaker 6>IF you're smart about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2753
02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:22.760
<v Speaker 6>and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2754
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:25.960
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This shit is a drain on society.</v>

2755
02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:27.910
<v Speaker 6>What they should also do the opposite </v>
<v Speaker 6>too,</v>

2756
02:00:27.940 --> 02:00:30.820
<v Speaker 6>which is a making vegetables and </v>
<v Speaker 6>healthy.</v>

2757
02:00:33.300 --> 02:00:36.880
<v Speaker 6>TheY would subsidize vegetables with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2758
02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:38.730
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>by taxing snickers.</v>

2759
02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:43.820
<v Speaker 6>You.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you're in favor of the government </v>

2760
02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:44.190
<v Speaker 6>getting all lee Willie and people's </v>
<v Speaker 6>business and taxing things.</v>

2761
02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:46.300
<v Speaker 6>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's people's business.</v>

2762
02:00:46.301 --> 02:00:48.010
<v Speaker 6>But where's that money go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2763
02:00:48.011 --> 02:00:50.740
<v Speaker 6>That's when the real problem was </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody thinks that taxing things is a</v>

2764
02:00:50.741 --> 02:00:55.741
<v Speaker 6>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you're going to give that money to </v>

2765
02:00:55.741 --> 02:00:57.901
<v Speaker 6>an inept government.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is going to create more fucking </v>

2766
02:00:57.901 --> 02:00:57.901
<v Speaker 6>jobs and it's not going to go towards </v>
<v Speaker 6>what you want it to go tour.</v>

2767
02:00:57.901 --> 02:01:02.820
<v Speaker 6>It's going to go towards many,</v>
<v Speaker 6>many jobs being set up for the </v>

2768
02:01:02.820 --> 02:01:03.650
<v Speaker 6>decimation of the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the spreading of this money that you've,</v>

2769
02:01:03.690 --> 02:01:06.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you brought in taxes.</v>

2770
02:01:06.041 --> 02:01:08.800
<v Speaker 6>Most of the time you raise taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna raise government.</v>

2771
02:01:08.801 --> 02:01:10.300
<v Speaker 6>The government gets bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's more jobs,</v>

2772
02:01:10.301 --> 02:01:13.930
<v Speaker 6>more people working in the government,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very few things actually get fixed,</v>

2773
02:01:14.110 --> 02:01:15.040
<v Speaker 6>but there'll be more people.</v>

2774
02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:15.580
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2775
02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:18.360
<v Speaker 6>or you can everyone can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2776
02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:23.550
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the alternative in these indicates of </v>

2777
02:01:23.550 --> 02:01:24.550
<v Speaker 6>cigarettes and it should be illegal to </v>
<v Speaker 6>kill people.</v>

2778
02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:26.430
<v Speaker 6>Illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I agree with you.</v>

2779
02:01:26.500 --> 02:01:28.330
<v Speaker 6>I mean if you're going to keep anything </v>
<v Speaker 6>illegal,</v>

2780
02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:30.940
<v Speaker 6>number one should be cigarettes and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't think they should be illegal.</v>

2781
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:33.400
<v Speaker 6>I think you should be able to smoke </v>
<v Speaker 6>cigarettes every fucking day.</v>

2782
02:01:33.401 --> 02:01:38.401
<v Speaker 6>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you're going to go by the law </v>

2783
02:01:38.401 --> 02:01:40.860
<v Speaker 6>that the government has the pattern of </v>
<v Speaker 6>behavior that the government has been </v>

2784
02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:44.201
<v Speaker 6>pushing since forever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they're looking out for the best </v>

2785
02:01:44.201 --> 02:01:46.661
<v Speaker 6>interests of their citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But tobacco stats are pretty </v>

2786
02:01:46.661 --> 02:01:46.661
<v Speaker 6>encouraging.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2787
02:01:46.661 --> 02:01:51.641
<v Speaker 6>if you say that's a good start,</v>
<v Speaker 6>450 million people or 450,000</v>

2788
02:01:52.611 --> 02:01:55.460
<v Speaker 6>people rather in this country alone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>450,000</v>

2789
02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:58.270
<v Speaker 6>just in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in 5 million worldwide,</v>

2790
02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:01.670
<v Speaker 6>hundred thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but still an insane number of people.</v>

2791
02:02:01.671 --> 02:02:04.580
<v Speaker 6>That pile of bodies is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>alcoholic.</v>

2792
02:02:04.670 --> 02:02:05.670
<v Speaker 6>Way more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2793
02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:06.070
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2794
02:02:06.270 --> 02:02:06.820
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

2795
02:02:06.830 --> 02:02:08.870
<v Speaker 6>Alcoholism related deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2796
02:02:08.871 --> 02:02:09.170
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2797
02:02:09.171 --> 02:02:10.340
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not as many as cigarettes,</v>

2798
02:02:10.590 --> 02:02:15.590
<v Speaker 6>so it's like 150,000,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm saying you could drink yourself </v>

2799
02:02:15.590 --> 02:02:20.471
<v Speaker 6>to death slow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about the amount of people </v>

2800
02:02:20.471 --> 02:02:23.171
<v Speaker 6>that stopped as a partially as a result </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the higher taxation and just making </v>

2801
02:02:23.391 --> 02:02:25.120
<v Speaker 6>them prohibitively expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2802
02:02:25.190 --> 02:02:29.570
<v Speaker 6>that's saying about maxine snickeRs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>even if you.</v>

2803
02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:34.600
<v Speaker 6>It may not be addictive to you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but clearly it's addictive to a lot of </v>

2804
02:02:34.851 --> 02:02:39.851
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would say if you want to tax the </v>

2805
02:02:39.851 --> 02:02:39.851
<v Speaker 6>fucking holy shit out of cigarettes and </v>
<v Speaker 6>keep selling them,</v>

2806
02:02:39.851 --> 02:02:40.850
<v Speaker 6>I would say good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That sounds like a good idea,</v>

2807
02:02:40.851 --> 02:02:45.851
<v Speaker 6>but is it possible that the money that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you take from the taxes would directly </v>

2808
02:02:45.891 --> 02:02:48.830
<v Speaker 6>go towards something that seems </v>
<v Speaker 6>worthwhile?</v>

2809
02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:50.210
<v Speaker 6>Will some.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How about the lotterY?</v>

2810
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:54.210
<v Speaker 6>A lottery goes fucking builds roads.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's the lottery build roads.</v>

2811
02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:55.970
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what It is.</v>

2812
02:02:55.971 --> 02:03:00.971
<v Speaker 6>I mean there are tons of things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The lottery in england pays for fucking </v>

2813
02:03:00.971 --> 02:03:01.810
<v Speaker 6>the bbc.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's amazing.</v>

2814
02:03:01.900 --> 02:03:03.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's such a.</v>

2815
02:03:03.250 --> 02:03:05.780
<v Speaker 6>It's and you want to talk about that </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

2816
02:03:05.810 --> 02:03:07.500
<v Speaker 6>The lottery should be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2817
02:03:07.530 --> 02:03:08.420
<v Speaker 6>and sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2818
02:03:08.421 --> 02:03:09.860
<v Speaker 6>but not really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can do it.</v>

2819
02:03:09.900 --> 02:03:14.030
<v Speaker 6>We're stupid people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It should be illegal is shorting things.</v>

2820
02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:17.640
<v Speaker 6>How has that nuttiness of gambling </v>
<v Speaker 6>illegal in,</v>

2821
02:03:17.650 --> 02:03:20.300
<v Speaker 6>in the stock market,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the nuttiness of gambling,</v>

2822
02:03:20.301 --> 02:03:22.490
<v Speaker 6>like the guy who shorted america's </v>
<v Speaker 6>credit rating,</v>

2823
02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:26.020
<v Speaker 6>that somehow or another I actually have </v>
<v Speaker 6>no beef with that guy because if you bet</v>

2824
02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:29.440
<v Speaker 6>on contraction,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2825
02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:33.500
<v Speaker 6>but you're betting that's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then yoU're betting you're not investing</v>

2826
02:03:33.590 --> 02:03:38.590
<v Speaker 6>in the snob,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in an investment is gambling.</v>

2827
02:03:39.170 --> 02:03:42.410
<v Speaker 6>You're gambling that this company is </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to become more sort of,</v>

2828
02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:46.250
<v Speaker 6>but you're supposed to be educated as to</v>
<v Speaker 6>the benefits of this company.</v>

2829
02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:51.250
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you write in fucking lockheed </v>

2830
02:03:51.250 --> 02:03:52.810
<v Speaker 6>martin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't even know her,</v>

2831
02:03:52.880 --> 02:03:54.250
<v Speaker 6>but I'm saying you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

2832
02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:58.070
<v Speaker 6>you don't thInk of it as gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You think of it as investing.</v>

2833
02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:03.100
<v Speaker 6>I am I absolutely family.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the stock people don't have any </v>

2834
02:04:03.530 --> 02:04:08.530
<v Speaker 6>sense of the term is not that people no </v>
<v Speaker 6>longer buy things because they believe </v>

2835
02:04:08.661 --> 02:04:10.960
<v Speaker 6>in the company.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just look at the metrics and go,</v>

2836
02:04:10.990 --> 02:04:11.690
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's true.</v>

2837
02:04:11.691 --> 02:04:13.010
<v Speaker 6>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know a gUy who,</v>

2838
02:04:13.011 --> 02:04:14.240
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>has apple stocK,</v>

2839
02:04:14.241 --> 02:04:19.241
<v Speaker 6>he's a huge apple fan and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>reasons why he's all excited about the </v>

2840
02:04:19.241 --> 02:04:19.880
<v Speaker 6>apple stock doing so good and she's a </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking apple fan.</v>

2841
02:04:19.881 --> 02:04:22.710
<v Speaker 6>He loves It.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there's a company mall,</v>

2842
02:04:22.770 --> 02:04:24.440
<v Speaker 6>small percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

2843
02:04:24.500 --> 02:04:28.370
<v Speaker 6>I think it might be a small percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think some people that invest,</v>

2844
02:04:28.371 --> 02:04:30.890
<v Speaker 6>they do invest with their people that </v>
<v Speaker 6>invested in,</v>

2845
02:04:30.891 --> 02:04:33.950
<v Speaker 6>for that are all excited at ford's doing</v>
<v Speaker 6>well because it's an american company,</v>

2846
02:04:33.951 --> 02:04:38.951
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they invest with their head and their </v>

2847
02:04:38.951 --> 02:04:38.951
<v Speaker 6>heart,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but think that that's not</v>

2848
02:04:38.951 --> 02:04:40.110
<v Speaker 5>the average person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2849
02:04:40.111 --> 02:04:41.470
<v Speaker 5>I think the average per.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

2850
02:04:41.550 --> 02:04:44.280
<v Speaker 5>I'm a relatively smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I keep saying,</v>

2851
02:04:44.970 --> 02:04:45.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2852
02:04:45.810 --> 02:04:46.740
<v Speaker 5>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2853
02:04:46.741 --> 02:04:51.741
<v Speaker 5>I invested,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what I got into like a </v>

2854
02:04:51.741 --> 02:04:53.580
<v Speaker 5>green investment thing because I'd like </v>
<v Speaker 5>them to do well,</v>

2855
02:04:53.581 --> 02:04:56.260
<v Speaker 5>but I'm probably losing money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>RiGht.</v>

2856
02:04:56.340 --> 02:04:57.060
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2857
02:04:57.080 --> 02:04:58.080
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like it.</v>

2858
02:04:58.220 --> 02:05:01.200
<v Speaker 5>It's a stupid way to my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my financial guy was like,</v>

2859
02:05:01.230 --> 02:05:04.670
<v Speaker 5>this is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just let me put it in petrochina,</v>

2860
02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:06.390
<v Speaker 5>lockheed martin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>koch g,</v>

2861
02:05:06.420 --> 02:05:07.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all that,</v>

2862
02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:08.640
<v Speaker 5>all these monoliths.</v>

2863
02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:13.210
<v Speaker 6>And so you manaGed it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you it,</v>

2864
02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:13.890
<v Speaker 6>then you did.</v>

2865
02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:19.090
<v Speaker 5>But I was discouraged by a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by a relatively.</v>

2866
02:05:19.091 --> 02:05:19.440
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2867
02:05:19.610 --> 02:05:23.450
<v Speaker 6>I see what I just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It seems to me that the idea of shorting</v>

2868
02:05:23.451 --> 02:05:25.550
<v Speaker 6>seems crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The idea that you can gamble,</v>

2869
02:05:25.551 --> 02:05:30.551
<v Speaker 6>that's when it's really gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anything else to me seems that it's </v>

2870
02:05:30.551 --> 02:05:30.551
<v Speaker 6>investing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You invest your money,</v>

2871
02:05:30.551 --> 02:05:32.570
<v Speaker 6>you buy shares of a stock that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>believe in,</v>

2872
02:05:32.720 --> 02:05:35.450
<v Speaker 6>whether you believe in them because you </v>
<v Speaker 6>like them or whether you believe in them</v>

2873
02:05:35.451 --> 02:05:40.451
<v Speaker 6>because you think it's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a good investment that they're </v>

2874
02:05:40.451 --> 02:05:40.640
<v Speaker 6>growing and they're going to continue to</v>
<v Speaker 6>grow.</v>

2875
02:05:40.641 --> 02:05:45.641
<v Speaker 6>You like the way they're set up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's one of the few naive </v>

2876
02:05:45.641 --> 02:05:46.100
<v Speaker 6>point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You hold your singing that like a singer</v>

2877
02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:48.880
<v Speaker 6>or holding their thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why is that name?</v>

2878
02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:54.280
<v Speaker 6>Because people just are in the stock </v>
<v Speaker 6>market to get to make a profit.</v>

2879
02:05:54.770 --> 02:05:59.770
<v Speaker 6>They're in it to make a profit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they look at this as this is gonna </v>

2880
02:05:59.770 --> 02:06:00.140
<v Speaker 6>make a profit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a good sound investment.</v>

2881
02:06:00.141 --> 02:06:00.850
<v Speaker 6>If I've done my bit,</v>

2882
02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:03.170
<v Speaker 5>I do with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked the company.</v>

2883
02:06:03.180 --> 02:06:04.750
<v Speaker 5>I like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just they haven't.</v>

2884
02:06:04.840 --> 02:06:07.360
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't have to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can see that.</v>

2885
02:06:07.361 --> 02:06:08.500
<v Speaker 6>That doesn't have to have anything to do</v>
<v Speaker 6>with.</v>

2886
02:06:08.501 --> 02:06:13.501
<v Speaker 6>It could be that you just look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they appear to be continuing to be </v>

2887
02:06:13.501 --> 02:06:13.720
<v Speaker 6>profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That makes sense to me though,</v>

2888
02:06:13.721 --> 02:06:16.720
<v Speaker 6>that you can invest in something that it</v>
<v Speaker 6>could be profitable.</v>

2889
02:06:16.721 --> 02:06:21.721
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to invest in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't make the opposite where you </v>

2890
02:06:21.721 --> 02:06:21.721
<v Speaker 6>go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like because you're gambling,</v>

2891
02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:27.340
<v Speaker 6>that's what I don't understand you are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You are literally saying I'm willing to </v>

2892
02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:28.600
<v Speaker 6>bet a billion dollars that this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>country,</v>

2893
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:30.910
<v Speaker 6>if it goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the thing.</v>

2894
02:06:30.911 --> 02:06:32.620
<v Speaker 6>It's not like it's the same</v>

2895
02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:35.840
<v Speaker 5>inverse of benny of investinG.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going,</v>

2896
02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:40.390
<v Speaker 5>you just basically you borrow money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you borrow a million dollars.</v>

2897
02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:41.310
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2898
02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:43.760
<v Speaker 5>and with that you have to start paying </v>
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>

2899
02:06:43.761 --> 02:06:43.970
<v Speaker 5>You have to.</v>

2900
02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:46.760
<v Speaker 6>I understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I understand the concept.</v>

2901
02:06:46.761 --> 02:06:49.210
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see it as just the inverse.</v>

2902
02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:52.550
<v Speaker 6>It seems fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Luckily I'm not in finance,</v>
