00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 2>Why can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why can't that work?</v>

3
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.100
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The computer is restarted in it.</v>

4
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.550
<v Speaker 3>Every time this computer restarts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the sounds fucked up on it.</v>

5
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.620
<v Speaker 2>We will soon be free of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological nightmare and into a new </v>

6
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Gentlemen,</v>

7
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:36.680
<v Speaker 2>we've got to try castor coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We tried to order the Sony thing,</v>

8
00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:41.300
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't work for us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just wasn't for streaming.</v>

9
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.990
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't the right piece of equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're getting a tri caster,</v>

10
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 2>but John headphone don't give a fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

11
00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John have fraud comic standing.</v>

12
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been awhile.</v>

13
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.080
<v Speaker 2>It's been awhile since I've been on </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

14
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.820
<v Speaker 2>It's been a while since I see you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First Time I saw you at the store.</v>

15
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 2>So we haven't seen each other in two </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

16
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Three?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

17
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I had to do that thing where you</v>

18
00:01:02.721 --> 00:01:03.940
<v Speaker 2>tax them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like who?</v>

19
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then like all my famous friends,</v>

20
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.800
<v Speaker 2>I never put their names in my phone as </v>
<v Speaker 2>their real names.</v>

21
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 2>Who am I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would probably,</v>

22
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:17.380
<v Speaker 2>I think probably don't tell me because </v>
<v Speaker 2>then yeah.</v>

23
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just just in case,</v>

24
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.480
<v Speaker 2>not that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

25
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.720
<v Speaker 2>but just in case you lose your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I was wondering like really famous </v>

26
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.101
<v Speaker 2>people who have famous friends like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Paris Hilton loses their phone all the </v>

27
00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 2>time and then two people hack into it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and get Lindsey Lohan summer.</v>

28
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's kind of hard to hack into an</v>
<v Speaker 2>iphone unless it's connected to the </v>

29
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.350
<v Speaker 2>cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

30
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Like if they got ahold of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably be pretty difficult.</v>

31
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 3>Crack your pass code.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They actually I think have programs I </v>

32
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 3>teach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just logging in and I'd like </v>

33
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.201
<v Speaker 3>taxi drivers I think do it and it turns </v>
<v Speaker 3>off all the tracking and then they </v>

34
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:49.570
<v Speaker 3>resell it like immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

35
00:01:49.571 --> 00:01:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I've had,</v>

36
00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:55.711
<v Speaker 3>I've had the cloud on my girlfriend's </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone and she left it in a car and like </v>

37
00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 3>in five minutes it was already disabled.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It never turned back on.</v>

38
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the thing.</v>

39
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.430
<v Speaker 2>I bet you're right because the thing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a lot of places that buy cell </v>

40
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.430
<v Speaker 2>phones now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they ask like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this yours?</v>

42
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

43
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.010
<v Speaker 2>I've seen places that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by cell phone.</v>

44
00:02:12.011 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever sold an old cell phone?</v>

45
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.620
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I'm paranoid because I know you </v>

46
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.620
<v Speaker 3>can just take anything off a phone like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

47
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Like I could take her phone even though </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've deleted it and even reused it for</v>

48
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.570
<v Speaker 3>six months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could still take stuff off of there </v>

49
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.570
<v Speaker 3>for like two years ago.</v>

50
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.570
<v Speaker 2>Santana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep mine.</v>

51
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 2>But then I was thinking I'm going to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something with it.</v>

52
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I have every version of the IPAD.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

53
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 2>well I'm just going to use this for my </v>
<v Speaker 2>home security camera.</v>

54
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.210
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it never,</v>

55
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 2>this ipad it's only gonna be for pre </v>
<v Speaker 2>show music and then I leave it at a club</v>

56
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:46.191
<v Speaker 2>and I used to try to do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I felt like I used to bring an </v>

57
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:46.191
<v Speaker 2>actual ipod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was oil.</v>

58
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.430
<v Speaker 2>I want to have an ipod is by itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't just want to have my phone,</v>

59
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.590
<v Speaker 2>but now that's ridiculous because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

60
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.080
<v Speaker 2>the new phones have 128 gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

61
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to use all that.</v>

62
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.510
<v Speaker 2>If you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're an asshole.</v>

63
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 2>What's going on on your phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

64
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Movies on there.</v>

65
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 4>Get the whole whole world plan on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>phone.</v>

66
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 4>John headphone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

67
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.760
<v Speaker 4>so it's been a year and somebody just </v>
<v Speaker 4>tweeted to,</v>

68
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they asked him.</v>

69
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm a little bit afraid because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>haven't seen you in so long.</v>

70
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 4>And then you invited me to be on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>

71
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.520
<v Speaker 4>People were worried on twitter that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were going to give me an intervention </v>

72
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.640
<v Speaker 4>and that tells me I should quit comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would never do guys.</v>

73
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 4>You're hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Standup comedian.</v>

74
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trust me.</v>

75
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:31.051
<v Speaker 4>I took that on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's joking around about a conversation </v>

76
00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 4>that we had with Brendan Shabazz.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was intense.</v>

77
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.540
<v Speaker 4>It was intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still feel like shit feel like shit </v>

78
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.540
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like shit while we're doing it.</v>

79
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 4>There was um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brendan last.</v>

80
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.030
<v Speaker 4>He got beat up and stopped by this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Travis Browne is one of the best in the </v>

81
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.561
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you wanted to talk about it on the </v>

82
00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:52.561
<v Speaker 4>air.</v>

83
00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:52.561
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wanted to talk about what we felt like</v>

84
00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:55.080
<v Speaker 4>on the earn and I asked him if he short.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

85
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

86
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 4>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get it out there,</v>

87
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:01.861
<v Speaker 4>I want to get it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to hear exactly what you really </v>

88
00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:01.861
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>

89
00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure what he thought I would think </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what I did think was different,</v>

90
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then as we were talking I kind of </v>

91
00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.801
<v Speaker 4>realized like I feel like his </v>
<v Speaker 4>perceptions of where he's at and the </v>

92
00:04:13.801 --> 00:04:18.721
<v Speaker 4>dangers of what has happened to him and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the reality of where he's at and the </v>

93
00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:20.860
<v Speaker 4>dangers of what have happened to them </v>
<v Speaker 4>were off.</v>

94
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.880
<v Speaker 4>And some people feel like I should have </v>
<v Speaker 4>done that conversation off the air.</v>

95
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.510
<v Speaker 4>And I feel like I probably agree with </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

96
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.540
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

97
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all things said and done.</v>

98
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.570
<v Speaker 4>The only good thing about having it on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the air is that other fighters can hear </v>

99
00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:39.040
<v Speaker 4>this and they can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

100
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.430
<v Speaker 4>they can form a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say educated opinion because </v>

101
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm definitely not a doctor or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>scientist or even smart.</v>

102
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 4>But I know a lot of information about </v>
<v Speaker 4>chronic brain damage from seeing it,</v>

103
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.640
<v Speaker 4>from talking to people who have it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from talking to doctors who are experts </v>

104
00:04:56.921 --> 00:05:01.921
<v Speaker 4>on it too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to know that I don't see a lot of </v>

105
00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:05.041
<v Speaker 4>people that are at the front of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tunnel waving a light in mma saying,</v>

106
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:06.250
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

107
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 4>you guys got to slow the fuck down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what's up here.</v>

108
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 4>And I think that that's the case with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>chronic brain damage.</v>

109
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:18.691
<v Speaker 4>Nfl is just dealing with now these </v>
<v Speaker 4>players from the seventies and eighties </v>

110
00:05:18.691 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 4>and the nineties and even the two </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousands that are just fucked up.</v>

111
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.190
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look in the Buckeye player that just </v>

112
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 4>committed suicide a couple weeks ago </v>
<v Speaker 4>from looking at him,</v>

113
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at.</v>

114
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 4>There's just a long list of players.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched some guy get k Oh the other </v>

115
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my goodness.</v>

116
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.440
<v Speaker 4>Somebody sent it to me on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a vine of these two football </v>

117
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.730
<v Speaker 4>parents colliding helmets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just see that one.</v>

118
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.190
<v Speaker 4>Jeremy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're j.</v>

119
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking football freak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>

120
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 4>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd probably want him.</v>

121
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:49.860
<v Speaker 4>It's fantasy football.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Street stakes.</v>

122
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was I was reading from A.</v>

123
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.330
<v Speaker 4>Somebody tweeted about it and then I </v>
<v Speaker 4>went to.</v>

124
00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know what the website was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then had tweet about like,</v>

125
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 4>why you were talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

126
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:05.981
<v Speaker 4>and so I just read the tweets like </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody was paraphrasing what you were </v>

127
00:06:05.981 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 4>saying and without even really known the</v>
<v Speaker 4>story,</v>

128
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.520
<v Speaker 4>all I got out of it was you wanted him </v>
<v Speaker 4>to just be careful with,</v>

129
00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 4>with getting smacked in the head because</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not gonna work out.</v>

130
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not that I wanted them to be </v>

131
00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.471
<v Speaker 4>careful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm one of them to consider ending it </v>

132
00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:23.471
<v Speaker 4>because I know he's going to end it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wanted,</v>

133
00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:27.551
<v Speaker 4>it ended.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was talking before this fight about </v>

134
00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:27.551
<v Speaker 4>like when he's going to get out after </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fight.</v>

135
00:06:27.551 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 4>He talked about two years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they had a 42 year idea,</v>

136
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the reality of getting head trauma </v>

137
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.610
<v Speaker 4>is cumulative and that guys who get </v>
<v Speaker 4>knocked out a few times,</v>

138
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 4>it becomes easier for them to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>knocked out again.</v>

139
00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.580
<v Speaker 4>And the damage is all compounding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're waiting.</v>

140
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.850
<v Speaker 4>It's like buying a bunch of shit on </v>
<v Speaker 4>credit and you're waiting for the bill </v>

141
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.021
<v Speaker 4>to come and you've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're driving around this nice car and </v>

142
00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:58.871
<v Speaker 4>you have this cool watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the reality is you owe a fuck load </v>

143
00:06:58.871 --> 00:07:02.321
<v Speaker 4>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have to work your dick </v>

144
00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:02.321
<v Speaker 4>off to pay that shit.</v>

145
00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:02.321
<v Speaker 4>You're not thinking about that right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

146
00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:03.040
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the chronic brain damage things,</v>

147
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:08.050
<v Speaker 4>a debt that you can never pay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're putting damage on your </v>

148
00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.590
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't manifest itself immediately.</v>

149
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 4>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes a while.</v>

150
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.780
<v Speaker 4>A lot of these players were fine when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they retired and then you've seen them </v>

151
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.230
<v Speaker 4>like Jim Mcmahon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sports illustrated article on,</v>

152
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.090
<v Speaker 4>Oh dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's terrifying.</v>

153
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.250
<v Speaker 4>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know shit about football,</v>

154
00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know who Jim Mcmahon was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was goddamn legendary quarterback,</v>

155
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 4>you know him and the bears and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole,</v>

156
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.440
<v Speaker 4>you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the superbowl shuffle and no one knew </v>

157
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.020
<v Speaker 4>who those guys were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's Foxville now.</v>

158
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.920
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

159
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 4>he will find himself in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 4>his house not knowing how he got there.</v>

160
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.340
<v Speaker 4>He's just looking for his keys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are Looking for what,</v>

161
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.370
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't know where he was going to </v>

162
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:45.370
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

163
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:45.370
<v Speaker 4>He forgets things all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

164
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.960
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to Brian Stan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were text message and back and forth </v>

165
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.141
<v Speaker 4>today and he was talking about people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that he knows that got it from being </v>

166
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:57.710
<v Speaker 4>soldiers from blasts and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's horrible.</v>

167
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:59.360
<v Speaker 4>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like these guys,</v>

168
00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:00.980
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't remember anything.</v>

169
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.410
<v Speaker 4>They have no energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're depressed all the time.</v>

170
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.020
<v Speaker 4>It's not everybody and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's.</v>

171
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.750
<v Speaker 4>The thing about fighting is you never </v>
<v Speaker 4>know when it's too late.</v>

172
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:16.990
<v Speaker 4>It's like some guys can get knocked out </v>
<v Speaker 4>once and go on from that to have great </v>

173
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:21.131
<v Speaker 4>careers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some guys can get knocked out a couple </v>

174
00:08:21.131 --> 00:08:21.131
<v Speaker 4>of times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're still in their bunny.</v>

175
00:08:21.131 --> 00:08:22.670
<v Speaker 4>They're just fighting beasts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like perfect example.</v>

176
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 4>That is Michael Bisping gets knocked out</v>
<v Speaker 4>by Dan Henderson,</v>

177
00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:27.890
<v Speaker 4>comes back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very successful,</v>

178
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:32.150

<v Speaker 4>comes back after that beats the shit out</v>

179
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:34.010
<v Speaker 4>of Kung lean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the best fights of his career.</v>

180
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.220
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he's,</v>

181
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.440
<v Speaker 4>he's been Kao to a couple of times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's only because he's fighting the </v>

182
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.750
<v Speaker 4>elite of the elite at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>level and you know,</v>

183
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:43.490
<v Speaker 4>he's just smudge it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

184
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:48.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Bisping is one of the best in </v>

185
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:48.750
<v Speaker 4>the fucking world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I felt like we shop.</v>

186
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.390
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was seeing that it was going to happen</v>

187
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.460
<v Speaker 4>more often and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

188
00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.940
<v Speaker 4>I fucking loved that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He is a great guy.</v>

189
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.260
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brendan Schaub,</v>

190
00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 4>he's a really interesting character </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's this big,</v>

191
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 4>hulking dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's a sweetheart.</v>

192
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.990
<v Speaker 4>He's like the nicest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He jokes around about how he's like a,</v>

193
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 4>a dolphin and a shark outfit on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside,</v>

194
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:16.500
<v Speaker 4>but he's a dolphin on the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's hilarious.</v>

195
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:20.100
<v Speaker 4>He's really honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like really honest about everything</v>

196
00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:25.101
<v Speaker 4>except like is fighting ability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think is fighting ability or his </v>

197
00:09:25.101 --> 00:09:25.200
<v Speaker 4>position.</v>

198
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.200
<v Speaker 4>He's got a slightly elevated sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's why he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

199
00:09:30.211 --> 00:09:35.211
<v Speaker 4>You have to have this sense that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>almost distorted in order to be a </v>

200
00:09:35.211 --> 00:09:37.110
<v Speaker 4>fighter in the first place because when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you first started out,</v>

201
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:42.230
<v Speaker 4>how could you imagine ever getting to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>championship level when you first </v>

202
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.171
<v Speaker 4>started out and you're getting hit every</v>
<v Speaker 4>time you move forward and getting taken </v>

203
00:09:45.171 --> 00:09:45.470
<v Speaker 4>down every time someone wants you to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

204
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.100
<v Speaker 4>it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

205
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:52.220
<v Speaker 4>it takes a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to have like almost this </v>

206
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.180
<v Speaker 4>like crazed idea of yourself to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighter in the first place.</v>

207
00:09:54.181 --> 00:09:58.860
<v Speaker 4>It's just extreme confidence and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know he's got that for sure.</v>

208
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of fighters to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

209
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:06.500
<v Speaker 4>It's great when you're winning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're winning that that extreme </v>

210
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.240
<v Speaker 4>confidence is awesome because that </v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme confidence like gives you like a</v>

211
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 4>boost over some other people who don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have that.</v>

212
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.620
<v Speaker 4>You might have like a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 4>boost.</v>

213
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:19.130
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's in training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's in how confident you feel </v>

214
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.260
<v Speaker 4>before the fight so you don't get as </v>
<v Speaker 4>nervous as he does.</v>

215
00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 4>There's all sorts of variables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you start losing,</v>

216
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.120
<v Speaker 4>that's when that can be a motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 4>because that thing doesn't want to see </v>

217
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.451
<v Speaker 4>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That ego is a tricky motherfucker </v>

218
00:10:32.451 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Speaker 4>because it can help you and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways they can push you to success,</v>

219
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:39.710
<v Speaker 4>but it can also fuck you up where you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>not seeing yourself the way you should.</v>

220
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.720
<v Speaker 4>You can't like you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't see yourself in a,</v>

221
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:47.870
<v Speaker 4>in a negative way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't allow it in so you don't look </v>

222
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:49.290
<v Speaker 4>at the flaws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't look at like.</v>

223
00:10:49.291 --> 00:10:53.910
<v Speaker 4>Especially true in martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a hyper critical,</v>

224
00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:59.100
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be extremely self critical </v>

225
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.020
<v Speaker 4>to be a competitive martial artists </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the stakes are so high.</v>

226
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:06.470
<v Speaker 4>You're getting kicked in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The face is one of the worst steaks and </v>

227
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 4>all of sports.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The possibility to this guide,</v>

228
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.040
<v Speaker 4>I'll say his name because I fucked it up</v>
<v Speaker 4>during the broadcast,</v>

229
00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:15.240
<v Speaker 4>we're seeing salmon at some on police is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the correct pronunciation.</v>

230
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.080
<v Speaker 4>He won this weekend with this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>destruction of the head kick.</v>

231
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.810
<v Speaker 4>He switched head kick the student the </v>
<v Speaker 4>face and boom,</v>

232
00:11:24.811 --> 00:11:26.340
<v Speaker 4>the lights go out and the guy went </v>
<v Speaker 4>stiff.</v>

233
00:11:26.341 --> 00:11:30.450
<v Speaker 4>It was one of those classic like worst </v>
<v Speaker 4>case scenario,</v>

234
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.970
<v Speaker 4>the worst thing that can happen to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the octagon,</v>

235
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.770
<v Speaker 4>and it was just a beautiful technique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've just shuffled that front leg and</v>

236
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.790
<v Speaker 4>Boehm Shin to the head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that is the stakes.</v>

237
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:45.390
<v Speaker 4>So you have to be so fucking critical </v>
<v Speaker 4>about your technique,</v>

238
00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:47.790
<v Speaker 4>about your conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 4>about your dedication,</v>

239
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:52.791
<v Speaker 4>your psychological outlook on fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those things you have.</v>

240
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 4>Keep those in a row.</v>

241
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.560
<v Speaker 4>It's so fucking dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't,</v>

242
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.450
<v Speaker 4>and when you start,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you lose and you know,</v>

243
00:12:01.451 --> 00:12:03.970
<v Speaker 4>you start looking at yourself in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>delusional way,</v>

244
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
<v Speaker 4>it can hamper your ability to work on </v>
<v Speaker 4>all those areas they can hit like </v>

245
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 4>anytime you have a delusional </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective and introspective outlook,</v>

246
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:18.121
<v Speaker 4>that's just not accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not doing yourself a favor like </v>

247
00:12:18.121 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 4>you need someone else to give you </v>
<v Speaker 4>advice.</v>

248
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.850
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you not see you're selling,</v>

249
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:26.970
<v Speaker 4>you're not seeing like things that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can correct and when you're in that </v>

250
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.321
<v Speaker 4>state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a martial artist it becomes very </v>

251
00:12:31.321 --> 00:12:33.421
<v Speaker 4>dangerous and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's common to get to for fighters </v>

252
00:12:33.421 --> 00:12:36.550
<v Speaker 4>because being a fighter's extremely </v>
<v Speaker 4>nerve wracking,</v>

253
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:42.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am barely qualified to speak of it </v>

254
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.210
<v Speaker 4>because I only did taekwondo tournaments</v>
<v Speaker 4>and some kickboxing,</v>

255
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.770
<v Speaker 4>but I just remember competing and being </v>
<v Speaker 4>scared out of my fucking mind.</v>

256
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:48.890
<v Speaker 4>I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

257
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.990
<v Speaker 4>it was 19 or 21 actually when I retired </v>
<v Speaker 4>in between 18 and 21.</v>

258
00:12:56.261 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 4>We're all the really dangerous fights </v>
<v Speaker 4>like national level fights.</v>

259
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.580
<v Speaker 4>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

260
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:07.610
<v Speaker 4>you experienced these extreme fears and </v>
<v Speaker 4>extreme highs and extreme lows.</v>

261
00:13:08.111 --> 00:13:13.111
<v Speaker 4>Like when you win,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the greatest feeling in the world </v>

262
00:13:13.111 --> 00:13:15.181
<v Speaker 4>for these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you see guys that win like Johnny </v>

263
00:13:15.181 --> 00:13:15.730
<v Speaker 4>Hendrix,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he won the title drops down.</v>

264
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.760
<v Speaker 4>He's just fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see this rush of joy that goes </v>

265
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.460
<v Speaker 4>through him that you and I are never </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to experience.</v>

266
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.370
<v Speaker 4>I've never experienced that in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>taekwondo tournament because it was.</v>

267
00:13:24.371 --> 00:13:27.400
<v Speaker 4>It didn't mean as much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what these guys are doing is like</v>

268
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:32.730
<v Speaker 4>this insane top of the mountain high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when you get to that top of the </v>

269
00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:36.760
<v Speaker 4>mountain high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guys who have had those big wins,</v>

270
00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:38.170
<v Speaker 4>like Brendan's had some big wins.</v>

271
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.680
<v Speaker 4>He knocked out Mirko Cro cop who's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a legendary cancer.</v>

272
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.550
<v Speaker 4>Mirko was legendary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's a.</v>

273
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:49.590
<v Speaker 4>He was like one of the best kick boxers </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever to enter into the glory days of </v>

274
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:49.640
<v Speaker 4>pride.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

275
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.190
<v Speaker 4>when Mirko Mirko has like a head kick </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kao highlight reel,</v>

276
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.170
<v Speaker 4>that's like one of the greatest of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

277
00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.270
<v Speaker 4>But if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Mirko Cro,</v>

278
00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:03.271
<v Speaker 4>cop fight should prove my point to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Brendan because if Mirko Cro cop and he </v>

279
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.710
<v Speaker 4>fought back when Mirko Cro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cop one,</v>

280
00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:10.711
<v Speaker 4>the pride heavyweight Grand Prix,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would have been a completely </v>

281
00:14:10.711 --> 00:14:11.950
<v Speaker 4>fucking different fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a different guy back then.</v>

282
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.770
<v Speaker 4>It was just a different guy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody knows it.</v>

283
00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:20.250
<v Speaker 4>He fought Gonzaga in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He fought a 80 Sanchez first beat him </v>

284
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.270
<v Speaker 4>and they fought Gonzaga and he got cro </v>
<v Speaker 4>copped essentially.</v>

285
00:14:25.271 --> 00:14:28.930
<v Speaker 4>He got head kicked by Gonzaga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's a very strong guy.</v>

286
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.090
<v Speaker 4>Gonzaga's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

287
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:35.250
<v Speaker 4>he walks onto the stage like when they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to weigh in on Zaga sounds </v>

288
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:35.250
<v Speaker 4>different than everybody else.</v>

289
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.220
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like it's made out of stone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a big,</v>

290
00:14:39.221 --> 00:14:41.950
<v Speaker 4>powerful fucking dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gonzaga is a beast.</v>

291
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:45.700
<v Speaker 4>Gonzaga correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One off the side of his head.</v>

292
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.880
<v Speaker 4>And from then on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

293
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:52.490
<v Speaker 4>he just wasn't the same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think those two fights,</v>

294
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.190
<v Speaker 4>like in the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was never the same.</v>

295
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.620
<v Speaker 4>His first two fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had some good fights in UFC.</v>

296
00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.270
<v Speaker 4>He was never the same as.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't pride.</v>

297
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:04.390
<v Speaker 4>You think a lot of fighters like stick </v>
<v Speaker 4>it out longer than they should because </v>

298
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.300
<v Speaker 4>there's no fallback.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like,</v>

299
00:15:05.301 --> 00:15:06.260
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fighter.</v>

300
00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:06.920
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

301
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:12.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean those guys have skills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I don't have any like me as a </v>

302
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.551
<v Speaker 4>comic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I ever decided I'm not going to be a </v>

303
00:15:15.551 --> 00:15:15.551
<v Speaker 4>comic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have zero other skills.</v>

304
00:15:15.551 --> 00:15:17.630
<v Speaker 4>There's almost nothing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I know how to do.</v>

305
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:23.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I even said when I was trying to like </v>

306
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:23.040
<v Speaker 4>make an analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I made a bad one.</v>

307
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.220
<v Speaker 4>I even said if I was a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

308
00:15:24.221 --> 00:15:27.950
<v Speaker 4>and I was fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would want everybody to tell me that I</v>

309
00:15:27.951 --> 00:15:32.951
<v Speaker 4>should stop if there's something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened to me and I wasn't funny </v>

310
00:15:32.951 --> 00:15:32.951
<v Speaker 4>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll still going onstage.</v>

311
00:15:32.951 --> 00:15:33.710
<v Speaker 4>I would want someone to come and tell </v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

312
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.780
<v Speaker 4>That's a terrible analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

313
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:39.290
<v Speaker 4>I was just looking for something and </v>
<v Speaker 4>after I said I was like,</v>

314
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:42.310
<v Speaker 4>that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously being a comedian,</v>

315
00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.440
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't cause brain damage if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just suck at something,</v>

316
00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:50.240
<v Speaker 4>you know the difference between sucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>at fighting and I shouldn't even use the</v>

317
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:53.060
<v Speaker 4>term sucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Being unsuccessful at fighting and being</v>

318
00:15:53.061 --> 00:15:55.760
<v Speaker 4>unsuccessful at like writing a book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you write a book and it sucks,</v>

319
00:15:55.761 --> 00:15:57.050
<v Speaker 4>everybody goes through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your book sucks,</v>

320
00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.050
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't give you a concussion,</v>

321
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:05.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't give you concussions and </v>

322
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:05.870
<v Speaker 4>training that you kind of try to ignore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

323
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.630
<v Speaker 4>dudes land on your fucking head and </v>
<v Speaker 4>training,</v>

324
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even in grappling guys collide,</v>

325
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:15.590
<v Speaker 4>collide heads all the time and these are</v>
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

326
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are all points against your brain.</v>

327
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.360
<v Speaker 4>Every one of them points against your </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>

328
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.920
<v Speaker 4>Every one of them points against your </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>

329
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.980
<v Speaker 4>Obviously comedy doesn't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you think I suck,</v>

330
00:16:24.981 --> 00:16:26.600
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel bad,</v>

331
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:30.530
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't hurt me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

332
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.350
<v Speaker 4>he had been losing fights lately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

333
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:38.410
<v Speaker 4>he had a real bad fight with her lawsky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like it was real clumsy and just </v>

334
00:16:39.831 --> 00:16:43.900
<v Speaker 4>look like both of them were just way out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of sync and are all.</v>

335
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.030
<v Speaker 4>Obviously it was super nervous because </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was his first fight back in the UFC.</v>

336
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.190
<v Speaker 4>And then our last,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he subsequent performance,</v>

337
00:16:49.191 --> 00:16:51.050
<v Speaker 4>he fought big foot Silva and looked </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking great.</v>

338
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.420
<v Speaker 4>Knocked him out in the first round and </v>
<v Speaker 4>looked smooth,</v>

339
00:16:53.421 --> 00:16:58.421
<v Speaker 4>so like he got over his jitters for his </v>
<v Speaker 4>second fight back because he had been </v>

340
00:16:58.421 --> 00:17:01.871
<v Speaker 4>out for eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our last was the UFC heavyweight champ </v>

341
00:17:01.871 --> 00:17:04.751
<v Speaker 4>at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just Brendan looked super obvious </v>

342
00:17:04.751 --> 00:17:05.150
<v Speaker 4>like he was like telegraphing is shot.</v>

343
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:09.980
<v Speaker 4>I was worried about them and I'm also </v>
<v Speaker 4>worried about him because he.</v>

344
00:17:09.981 --> 00:17:13.580
<v Speaker 4>Before that he got knocked out by Ben </v>
<v Speaker 4>Rothwell and then he beat,</v>

345
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.010
<v Speaker 4>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lefarge Johnson,</v>

346
00:17:16.011 --> 00:17:19.100
<v Speaker 4>who's a beast of our Johnson's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>scary.</v>

347
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:24.340
<v Speaker 4>He's a vicious puncher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beat Lavar by taking them down and just </v>

348
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:27.611
<v Speaker 4>holding them down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's basically how he won that fight </v>

349
00:17:27.611 --> 00:17:27.611
<v Speaker 4>and even kind of said like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

350
00:17:27.611 --> 00:17:31.511
<v Speaker 4>I'm not standing with that fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is very intelligent of was a good </v>

351
00:17:31.511 --> 00:17:35.051
<v Speaker 4>win for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fought Matt Mitrione and condom and it </v>

352
00:17:35.051 --> 00:17:35.270
<v Speaker 4>darce choke and put them to sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a big one.</v>

353
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.780
<v Speaker 4>That was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I worry about is not those fights.</v>

354
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:42.200
<v Speaker 4>What I worry about is a fights where we </v>
<v Speaker 4>get hit with Ben Rothwell hit him.</v>

355
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.020
<v Speaker 4>Ben Rothwell hit him with one left so I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can just shut the lights out.</v>

356
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.260
<v Speaker 4>His body dropped and Roth was on top of </v>
<v Speaker 4>him dropping bombs know,</v>

357
00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.910
<v Speaker 4>and then he talked about it on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>

358
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.910
<v Speaker 4>He was saying that he actually got hurt </v>
<v Speaker 4>before that in training sparring with </v>

359
00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:00.141
<v Speaker 4>Shane Carwyn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shane Carwood apparently heard I'm </v>

360
00:18:00.141 --> 00:18:02.190
<v Speaker 4>really bad with a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to factor in.</v>

361
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:06.300
<v Speaker 4>How many times did he sparely Shane car </v>
<v Speaker 4>when my mind starts going,</v>

362
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:11.320
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're probably spawn with Shane Carwyn </v>

363
00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:11.320
<v Speaker 4>once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least.</v>

364
00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.220
<v Speaker 4>Shane car one is a mother fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to talk about a dude who's </v>

365
00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.780
<v Speaker 4>built for war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've met a lot of like freak athletes in</v>

366
00:18:18.781 --> 00:18:20.180
<v Speaker 4>the UFC.</v>

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:34.020
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you think about like elite level </v>

371
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.870
<v Speaker 4>fighters and elite elite level athletes,</v>

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.640
<v Speaker 4>fucking good that it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

374
00:18:44.641 --> 00:18:49.641
<v Speaker 4>it becomes a matter of whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to be the kind of guy who loses</v>

375
00:18:51.301 --> 00:18:56.301

380
00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:07.840
<v Speaker 3>it's scary that you're concerned with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend because you work in the business </v>

381
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:13.570
<v Speaker 3>and it's interesting to see where this </v>
<v Speaker 3>new information comes in,</v>

382
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:19.300
<v Speaker 3>how danger it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you can sit there and even be </v>

383
00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:19.300
<v Speaker 3>friends with anybody but</v>

384
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.020
<v Speaker 4>without.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It can be friends with a man because you</v>

385
00:19:21.021 --> 00:19:23.980
<v Speaker 4>can take a certain amount of punches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just gotTa know when to get out.</v>

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.260
<v Speaker 4>Your friends got to know to let you out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I was saying about freaks,</v>

387
00:19:27.261 --> 00:19:28.990
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shane Carwyn,</v>

388
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.870
<v Speaker 4>St Darwin has fists that I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 4>shitting you.</v>

389
00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.510
<v Speaker 4>They look like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See that Marshall amp over there?</v>

390
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:40.870
<v Speaker 4>That's like Shane Carlin's fist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're the most ridiculous thing I've </v>

391
00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:44.120
<v Speaker 4>ever seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had like four or five xl gloves,</v>

392
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:48.530
<v Speaker 4>like it was always a big thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>brock lesnar had these giant fists until</v>

393
00:19:48.531 --> 00:19:50.980
<v Speaker 4>he fought Carwyn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Carlin actually had bigger fist and</v>

394
00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:51.590
<v Speaker 4>lesnar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

395
00:19:51.591 --> 00:19:53.990
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about things that don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>even make sense.</v>

396
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.680
<v Speaker 4>It's like his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His body structure is so odd.</v>

397
00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.800
<v Speaker 4>He came into Jujitsu once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was training at a mall Easton's place </v>

398
00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:02.800
<v Speaker 4>in Boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Colorado.</v>

399
00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.400
<v Speaker 4>It's the best Jujitsu in Colorado in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mall has this beautiful gym where </v>

400
00:20:08.511 --> 00:20:11.360
<v Speaker 4>everybody's rolling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're in class and this guy walks in and</v>

401
00:20:11.361 --> 00:20:13.280
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not even a fucking person.</v>

402
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:14.570
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that?</v>

403
00:20:14.571 --> 00:20:16.760
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guys got like a gene,</v>

404
00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.730
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a pair of jeans on and a like a tee</v>

405
00:20:19.731 --> 00:20:20.270
<v Speaker 4>shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You probably,</v>

406
00:20:20.271 --> 00:20:23.840
<v Speaker 4>it's probably like a double xl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's built like a fucking superhero.</v>

407
00:20:23.841 --> 00:20:25.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then I realized it's Corwin.</v>

<v Speaker 4>when is until you see him out with </v>

409
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:34.871
<v Speaker 4>regular people in a normal sort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost like everybody else has just </v>

410
00:20:34.871 --> 00:20:39.221
<v Speaker 4>walking around their normal clothes and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then this guy walks in and it doesn't </v>

411
00:20:39.221 --> 00:20:39.221
<v Speaker 4>even look like he's a fucking human.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

412
00:20:39.221 --> 00:20:44.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean just go villa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that guy was sparring with Brendan </v>

413
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:48.130
<v Speaker 4>on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hits</v>

414
00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:53.290
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knocked Gabriel Gonzaga dead with a </v>

415
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:53.290
<v Speaker 2>punch from like seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight inches away.</v>

416
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:55.570
<v Speaker 2>Just just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just crank,</v>

417
00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.190
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

418
00:20:57.191 --> 00:21:02.191
<v Speaker 2>he was a destroyer and so shane was </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting in sparring sessions on a </v>

419
00:21:02.191 --> 00:21:06.190
<v Speaker 2>regular basis with Brendan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's getting hit all the time.</v>

420
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:08.590
<v Speaker 2>There's Shankar wins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fists are on the right.</v>

421
00:21:08.591 --> 00:21:11.560
<v Speaker 2>And Brock Lesnar's are on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

422
00:21:11.561 --> 00:21:13.930
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a God damn gorilla.</v>

423
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.910
<v Speaker 2>He's a goddamn shaved down white </v>
<v Speaker 2>gorilla.</v>

424
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:21.480
<v Speaker 2>He could hold that iphone plus that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have been a,</v>

425
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.660
<v Speaker 2>he would have been a champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

426
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.730
<v Speaker 2>he had a few issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them like back issues from um,</v>

427
00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 2>all of his years of playing football.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had some serious like,</v>

428
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.930
<v Speaker 2>like stingers and discs issues and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

429
00:21:34.931 --> 00:21:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Those guys are just colliding into each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

430
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.670
<v Speaker 2>big giant dudes that size colliding into</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>

431
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.970
<v Speaker 2>but if he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he just went straight to mma,</v>

432
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:48.360
<v Speaker 2>wrestling and mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that dude would have been a </v>

433
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:48.360
<v Speaker 2>world champion.</v>

434
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.840
<v Speaker 2>He was athletic freak because she was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking strong,</v>

435
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like he was one of those dudes</v>

436
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:57.040
<v Speaker 2>like you couldn't let him hit you if he </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit you.</v>

437
00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:02.100
<v Speaker 2>He fought Frank Mir and it was one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most brutal beat downs I've ever </v>

438
00:22:02.381 --> 00:22:04.750
<v Speaker 2>seen in all my years because the way he </v>
<v Speaker 2>did it,</v>

439
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.080
<v Speaker 2>he muscled Frank Mir up against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cage,</v>

440
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.710
<v Speaker 2>got him in like a collar tie or maybe a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a tight overtook.</v>

441
00:22:11.711 --> 00:22:16.711
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember which one it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he starts blasting them with </v>

442
00:22:16.711 --> 00:22:17.500
<v Speaker 2>left upper cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just boom,</v>

443
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:22.590
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could see me or stock can't get </v>

444
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.980
<v Speaker 2>out and can't take these shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's just.</v>

445
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:29.130
<v Speaker 2>He just sprinted at him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sprint out on him with bombs and </v>

446
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:32.971
<v Speaker 2>the mirror went down and they finished </v>
<v Speaker 2>them off on the ground and that was a </v>

447
00:22:32.971 --> 00:22:32.971
<v Speaker 2>brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal knockout.</v>

448
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.340
<v Speaker 2>So Brendan was sparring with that guy on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a regular basis.</v>

449
00:22:36.341 --> 00:22:38.140
<v Speaker 2>So it's not as fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only got hit,</v>

450
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:43.230
<v Speaker 2>I got hit maybe twice in my life where </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I thought I was done with like </v>

451
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.430
<v Speaker 2>stars in that weird buzzing sound that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

452
00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.590
<v Speaker 2>One was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've told this story before,</v>

453
00:22:50.591 --> 00:22:55.480
<v Speaker 2>Danny bonaduce and then the other was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Stephan Bonner.</v>

454
00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:00.540
<v Speaker 2>This was years and years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were sparring for some reason or he </v>

455
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.040
<v Speaker 2>was sparring with Stephan Bonner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was at.</v>

456
00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were at Krav Maga.</v>

457
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:10.320
<v Speaker 2>He was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was training for a movie or </v>

458
00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:10.750
<v Speaker 2>something and some of the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stunt guys were so anyway,</v>

459
00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:15.751
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we started sparring and then he gets </v>

460
00:23:15.751 --> 00:23:18.271
<v Speaker 2>into the sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm thinking oh he's probably just </v>

461
00:23:18.271 --> 00:23:19.180
<v Speaker 2>wants to know how to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've been kind of bounced around.</v>

462
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.120
<v Speaker 2>Next thing I know I just heard ringing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and whatever.</v>

463
00:23:22.121 --> 00:23:27.121
<v Speaker 2>He kicked me in the thigh that not like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to like we were sparring so he </v>

464
00:23:27.121 --> 00:23:29.450
<v Speaker 2>wasn't trying to full blast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

465
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:34.500
<v Speaker 2>whatever is 30 percent is is my 150 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent with the 40 year olds I box,</v>

466
00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.810
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was nothing to do with him,</v>

467
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:42.990
<v Speaker 2>but that was the first time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was ringing and I'm like Oh </v>

468
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.690
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was once.</v>

469
00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 2>It's too many look and imagine</v>

470
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.450
<v Speaker 4>that over 12 years and just not just </v>
<v Speaker 4>those like football injuries to.</v>

471
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:55.370
<v Speaker 4>Brendan also played football I believe </v>
<v Speaker 4>college and high school and you know,</v>

472
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:56.660
<v Speaker 4>he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was a fucking,</v>

473
00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:00.860
<v Speaker 4>he still is a really good athlete and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why he's become a good fighter.</v>

474
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:04.040
<v Speaker 4>But the difference between a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighter,</v>

475
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:09.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's a very good fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the difference between that and the </v>

476
00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:09.250
<v Speaker 4>top of the heap guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a leak,</v>

477
00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:13.870
<v Speaker 4>there's a leap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a bridge that you have to </v>

478
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.870
<v Speaker 4>cross.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you cross that bridge physically?</v>

479
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:18.311
<v Speaker 4>You never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's only 30 years old if he </v>

480
00:24:18.311 --> 00:24:19.520
<v Speaker 4>became like super dedicated and went to </v>
<v Speaker 4>a very strict Moitai camp.</v>

481
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:21.620
<v Speaker 4>And learned like really wicked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wicked,</v>

482
00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:24.680
<v Speaker 4>stand up and didn't fight for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But how do you feed yourself when you're</v>

483
00:24:24.681 --> 00:24:26.480
<v Speaker 4>doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know when you're a pro athlete.</v>

484
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:27.590
<v Speaker 4>That would be really.</v>

485
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:32.650
<v Speaker 4>If he did that though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he just stopped only training and </v>

486
00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:33.020
<v Speaker 4>competing for fights and I know he works</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a skills as well,</v>

487
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.350
<v Speaker 4>but if you just completely dedicated </v>
<v Speaker 4>himself to the scariest part,</v>

488
00:24:36.351 --> 00:24:38.790
<v Speaker 4>which is the kickboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the scariest shit.</v>

489
00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.510
<v Speaker 4>That's the shit that everybody should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're,</v>

490
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.490
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're coming into it with nothing,</v>

491
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.580
<v Speaker 4>that's a shit you should almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrate on the most because it's the</v>

492
00:24:46.581 --> 00:24:49.100
<v Speaker 4>most dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you don't have it good defensively.</v>

493
00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.960
<v Speaker 4>Like if you get submitted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's bad.</v>

494
00:24:50.961 --> 00:24:52.610
<v Speaker 4>You know you can break your arm for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

495
00:24:52.611 --> 00:24:54.920
<v Speaker 4>You can get choked out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they can fix your fucking arm.</v>

496
00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.280
<v Speaker 4>You get too many knees to the head from </v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy like alister over him.</v>

497
00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:00.710
<v Speaker 4>You know you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want that.</v>

498
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.880
<v Speaker 4>You know the fighting is all about </v>
<v Speaker 4>mitigating damage.</v>

499
00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.040
<v Speaker 4>It's all about inflicting as much as you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>

500
00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:08.570
<v Speaker 4>but mitigating as much as you can.</v>

501
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:13.570
<v Speaker 4>And one of the best ways to mitigate </v>
<v Speaker 4>damage is technical proficiency and </v>

502
00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:14.240
<v Speaker 4>that's something that people don't think</v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

503
00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:16.070
<v Speaker 4>They want to think about strength and </v>
<v Speaker 4>conditioning.</v>

504
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.720
<v Speaker 4>They want to think about running up </v>
<v Speaker 4>hills.</v>

505
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:21.170
<v Speaker 4>The most important thing is technical </v>
<v Speaker 4>proficiency.</v>

506
00:25:21.171 --> 00:25:25.550
<v Speaker 4>It's the most important thing by far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's some guys that unfortunately</v>

507
00:25:25.551 --> 00:25:29.630
<v Speaker 4>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they come into striking late in life,</v>

508
00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:35.130
<v Speaker 4>like some guys come into striking and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a background long background </v>

509
00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:39.460
<v Speaker 4>of wrestling and so they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not used to jumping forward and </v>

510
00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:43.010
<v Speaker 4>throwing combinations and footwork and </v>
<v Speaker 4>drills and it's alien to them.</v>

511
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.020
<v Speaker 4>For whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their body doesn't adapt to it.</v>

512
00:25:45.021 --> 00:25:47.090
<v Speaker 4>You see a lot with white wrestlers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

513
00:25:47.091 --> 00:25:48.560
<v Speaker 4>white guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's true.</v>

514
00:25:48.561 --> 00:25:51.350
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of white wrestlers that </v>
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason,</v>

515
00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:56.250
<v Speaker 4>there's just slow with their punches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some guys that excel like it.</v>

516
00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:58.550
<v Speaker 4>Jake ellenberger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously Johnny Hendricks,</v>

517
00:25:58.551 --> 00:26:01.100
<v Speaker 4>obviously those guys started out as </v>
<v Speaker 4>amateur wrestlers,</v>

518
00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:04.550
<v Speaker 4>but learned along the way to blast power</v>
<v Speaker 4>punches.</v>

519
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.560
<v Speaker 4>But some guys never do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

520
00:26:06.561 --> 00:26:11.561
<v Speaker 4>there's guys like Ben Astron who I think</v>
<v Speaker 4>is one of the best hundred 70 pounders </v>

521
00:26:11.561 --> 00:26:12.110
<v Speaker 4>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a wicked wrestler.</v>

522
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.840
<v Speaker 4>But his stand up is just really to close</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gap.</v>

523
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.660
<v Speaker 4>It's just to close the gap and then he </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets in on you and you're fucked.</v>

524
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.100
<v Speaker 4>He's just too good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just.</v>

525
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.170
<v Speaker 4>His wrestling is so much better than </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody else's.</v>

526
00:26:21.171 --> 00:26:23.330
<v Speaker 4>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he gets in on you,</v>

527
00:26:23.331 --> 00:26:24.420
<v Speaker 4>it's Foxville,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

528
00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.750
<v Speaker 4>So his thing is all just about getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>it on you,</v>

529
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.060
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>

530
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.490
<v Speaker 4>but starting out with a deficit in </v>
<v Speaker 4>strikings,</v>

531
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:37.510
<v Speaker 4>the most dangerous because if you're one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of those guys that doesn't have that </v>

532
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:40.571
<v Speaker 4>fast twitch body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a tyron woodley body or Hector </v>

533
00:26:40.571 --> 00:26:40.571
<v Speaker 4>Lombard body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you started off as a Grandpa,</v>

534
00:26:40.571 --> 00:26:45.520
<v Speaker 4>but you can pick up the strike and </v>
<v Speaker 4>really quickly if you don't have that </v>

535
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:45.520
<v Speaker 4>kind</v>

536
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.780
<v Speaker 2>of body and you don't have that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>coaching and you know,</v>

537
00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:51.850
<v Speaker 2>have that kind of training and the gym </v>
<v Speaker 2>with her going over technique with you </v>

538
00:26:51.931 --> 00:26:56.931
<v Speaker 2>with a fine tooth comb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking dangerous aspect of </v>

539
00:26:56.931 --> 00:27:00.111
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the most dangerous aspect is the </v>

540
00:27:00.111 --> 00:27:00.111
<v Speaker 2>one thing that you don't want to suck </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

541
00:27:00.111 --> 00:27:01.800
<v Speaker 2>The one thing that you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fail at is striking.</v>

542
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.460
<v Speaker 2>And if you fail at wrestling and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't just get taken down,</v>

543
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not good,</v>

544
00:27:06.661 --> 00:27:11.661
<v Speaker 2>but it's a little bit better than </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting fucking wheel kicked in the </v>

545
00:27:11.661 --> 00:27:13.110
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was good at striking.</v>

546
00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:18.150
<v Speaker 2>My problem was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is I stopped striking about five inches </v>

547
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.050
<v Speaker 2>away from your face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's not good.</v>

548
00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.380
<v Speaker 2>So I could never figure out how to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my thing.</v>

549
00:27:25.381 --> 00:27:30.381
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd always throw everything and you can </v>

550
00:27:30.381 --> 00:27:30.630
<v Speaker 2>literally just stick your face out and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't hit you because I would never.</v>

551
00:27:30.631 --> 00:27:33.680
<v Speaker 2>I was afraid to always take that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

552
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>

553
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:39.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

554
00:27:39.121 --> 00:27:41.940
<v Speaker 2>we talked about it before when you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>sparring in class.</v>

555
00:27:41.941 --> 00:27:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far?</v>

556
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Like you gotta be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You told me that somebody had grabbed </v>

557
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:48.050
<v Speaker 2>your foot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you threw a kick that grab your foot,</v>

558
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:49.050
<v Speaker 2>held onto it and knocked you out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

559
00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.100
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on man,</v>

560
00:27:50.101 --> 00:27:53.030
<v Speaker 2>you can't be doing that kind of spark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to bring my box,</v>

561
00:27:53.031 --> 00:27:55.880
<v Speaker 2>he stuff on the road and then I go to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bar,</v>

562
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:57.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a boxing.</v>

563
00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.790
<v Speaker 2>I get a trainer for the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is back when I was.</v>

564
00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.810
<v Speaker 2>I would wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>

565
00:28:01.811 --> 00:28:05.130
<v Speaker 2>I would go and do that and then sure </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough they'd always say,</v>

566
00:28:05.131 --> 00:28:06.780
<v Speaker 2>do you feel like sparring?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep in mind,</v>

567
00:28:06.781 --> 00:28:08.760
<v Speaker 2>this was 10 years ago when I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

568
00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:13.761
<v Speaker 2>let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then with defined out your comedian </v>

569
00:28:13.761 --> 00:28:13.761
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they just want to kill you.</v>

570
00:28:13.761 --> 00:28:16.110
<v Speaker 2>It's a better story for them to knock </v>
<v Speaker 2>you off.</v>

571
00:28:16.111 --> 00:28:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Then too lightly spar just so people get</v>
<v Speaker 2>their sweat on you.</v>

572
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.340
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

573
00:28:20.341 --> 00:28:22.040
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

574
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:27.130
<v Speaker 2>so I stopped doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people are rude with them and they </v>

575
00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:27.130
<v Speaker 2>don't think it's a big deal to Knoxville</v>
<v Speaker 2>me the fuck out.</v>

576
00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:30.270
<v Speaker 2>So rude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

577
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:32.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking.</v>

578
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:37.490
<v Speaker 2>You could really damaged someone's head </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know that's the point of fighting </v>

579
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:43.100
<v Speaker 2>and in a way it makes me a hypocrite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fully aware of that because I do </v>

580
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.070
<v Speaker 2>enjoy fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love watching it.</v>

581
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to not watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>

582
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:52.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of brandon as a human </v>
<v Speaker 2>being and Brendan Schaub is a guy with </v>

583
00:28:54.211 --> 00:28:55.860
<v Speaker 2>options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could do other things.</v>

584
00:28:55.890 --> 00:29:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Brendan can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd go on and people from your pod,</v>

585
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:05.150
<v Speaker 2>like I only know him from the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really even know him as a </v>

586
00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:05.150
<v Speaker 2>fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

587
00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.680
<v Speaker 2>they got money when he's a guest here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always super entertaining to me.</v>

588
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.080
<v Speaker 2>He is always funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

589
00:29:10.081 --> 00:29:10.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

590
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:15.710
<v Speaker 2>He's a funny dude and he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a really good dude and I think a </v>

591
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:18.831
<v Speaker 2>lot of people don't understand him </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of some of the hype surrounding </v>

592
00:29:18.831 --> 00:29:19.650
<v Speaker 2>some of his fights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would talk a lot of trash,</v>

593
00:29:19.651 --> 00:29:24.651
<v Speaker 2>like he talked about trust in this fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people get mad at him for that and </v>

594
00:29:24.651 --> 00:29:24.651
<v Speaker 2>they think he's that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

595
00:29:24.651 --> 00:29:29.601
<v Speaker 2>they'd get mad at them for maybe over </v>
<v Speaker 2>assessing his possibilities being a </v>

596
00:29:29.601 --> 00:29:32.220
<v Speaker 2>champion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a fucking great dude.</v>

597
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:33.990
<v Speaker 2>He really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could do anything.</v>

598
00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:39.330
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dedication that led him to go from </v>

599
00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:41.841
<v Speaker 2>football to mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could go from MMA to having like a </v>

600
00:29:41.841 --> 00:29:44.380
<v Speaker 2>super podcast and career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a real option now.</v>

601
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even better and better.</v>

602
00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Where's the fucking John Hef Rancho.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

603
00:29:49.751 --> 00:29:53.050
<v Speaker 2>I had one for like a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You and repad a show for me and her ipad</v>

604
00:29:53.051 --> 00:29:58.051
<v Speaker 2>to show and then stopped doing it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I stopped for a long time and then </v>

605
00:29:58.481 --> 00:30:02.050
<v Speaker 2>I started one called the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a and I was like,</v>

606
00:30:02.051 --> 00:30:07.051
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to talk about what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I'm at physically and mentally </v>

607
00:30:07.051 --> 00:30:07.051
<v Speaker 2>that'll be that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen,</v>

608
00:30:07.051 --> 00:30:07.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't have to figure out.</v>

609
00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:09.040
<v Speaker 2>That's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then.</v>

610
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:11.490
<v Speaker 2>So I had like Martha Quinn on and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

611
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you interview her after she got out </v>

612
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:16.500
<v Speaker 2>of jail?</v>

613
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Martha Quinn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the MTV Vj.</v>

614
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.630
<v Speaker 2>Thinking of Martha Stewart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martha.</v>

615
00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.120
<v Speaker 2>So it started off really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>

616
00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:27.300
<v Speaker 2>And then I think it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm up until a month and a half </v>

617
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.120
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't recorded one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So mark don't know how to do it by </v>

618
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.941
<v Speaker 2>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how bill does this podcast with </v>

619
00:30:32.941 --> 00:30:34.410

<v Speaker 2>It's so him.</v>

622
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:40.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

623
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.980
<v Speaker 2>the best one as far as capturing him </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing like a regular set.</v>

624
00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.430
<v Speaker 2>He so loose up there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>going to get ready to shoot my fourth.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This last one's the closest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you did it in Denver at the downtown</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

665
00:32:24.971 --> 00:32:27.640
<v Speaker 2>I've met her many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many moons ago.</v>

666
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Met a stripper who was Mormon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the whole thing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Mormon.</v>

669
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Know that club that I worked at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>year that I've ever been to Lexington,</v>

670
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Lexington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>off-broadway,</v>

671
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.660
<v Speaker 2>Lexington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kentucky.</v>

672
00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.960
<v Speaker 2>I used to do the Improv there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

673
00:32:47.961 --> 00:32:51.170
<v Speaker 2>So this place I believe it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's off Broadway.</v>

674
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.200
<v Speaker 2>It's in like a strip mall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the club's been there forever and </v>

675
00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:56.570
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those ones when you go and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the head shots,</v>

676
00:32:56.571 --> 00:32:58.880
<v Speaker 2>but they're from dudes from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>

677
00:32:59.770 --> 00:33:02.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see all that.</v>

678
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:05.960
<v Speaker 2>And then so in the place list lung </v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty.</v>

679
00:33:05.961 --> 00:33:07.810
<v Speaker 2>So in my brain I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

680
00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:12.910
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

681
00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:12.910

<v Speaker 2>It took me till show to,</v>

682
00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:15.620
<v Speaker 2>to figure out why the audiences were so </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad ass.</v>

683
00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.520
<v Speaker 2>They don't serve food or nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was when.</v>

684
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.830
<v Speaker 2>So you're taking out the element of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people eating steak and mashed potatoes.</v>

685
00:33:22.831 --> 00:33:25.400
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was terrible for comedy,</v>

686
00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.960
<v Speaker 2>which is still really fun.</v>

687
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.070
<v Speaker 2>I never would have thought like great </v>
<v Speaker 2>shows.</v>

688
00:33:29.071 --> 00:33:31.660
<v Speaker 2>Nobody healthily or nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's,</v>

689
00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:36.670
<v Speaker 2>it's nice for people because they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>get like a dinner and a show in at the </v>

690
00:33:36.741 --> 00:33:38.240
<v Speaker 2>same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good for them,</v>

691
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:41.060
<v Speaker 2>but like for the show itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the overall performance,</v>

692
00:33:41.061 --> 00:33:46.061
<v Speaker 2>like sometimes you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking down at the crowd and </v>

693
00:33:46.061 --> 00:33:48.701
<v Speaker 2>they were literally looking sideways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everybody's looking sideways and </v>

694
00:33:48.701 --> 00:33:49.820
<v Speaker 2>they're eating meals and you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>standups like you're doing stand up in a</v>

695
00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:52.160
<v Speaker 2>restaurant and this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking weird,</v>

696
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.980
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are dinner,</v>

697
00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:58.660
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This past week I'm doing my stuff and </v>

698
00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:58.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did I lose half the room?</v>

699
00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.280
<v Speaker 2>And then you see two waitstaff with </v>
<v Speaker 2>pieces of cake,</v>

700
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:05.060
<v Speaker 2>but they had like 20 pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're passing out cake to everybody</v>

701
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.210
<v Speaker 2>at a birthday party or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

702
00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.020
<v Speaker 2>like the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're going to eat cake,</v>

703
00:34:09.021 --> 00:34:10.070
<v Speaker 2>you're not gonna pay attention.</v>

704
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:15.070
<v Speaker 2>Anytime cake runs around is usually when</v>
<v Speaker 2>the focus goes onto the cake no matter </v>

705
00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:17.540
<v Speaker 2>no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was Kinda.</v>

706
00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:21.310
<v Speaker 2>That's the one benefit of doing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>theater because you're doing a theater.</v>

707
00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:26.380
<v Speaker 2>They have a bar in the very back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had to go through the doors to get </v>

708
00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:26.380
<v Speaker 2>to the bar and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way.</v>

709
00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Checks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no checks,</v>

710
00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.180
<v Speaker 2>no waitress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get your booze for the show.</v>

711
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:31.310
<v Speaker 2>Show generally starts about 15 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>late.</v>

712
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Give everybody a chance to get back </v>
<v Speaker 2>their seat,</v>

713
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.910
<v Speaker 2>their drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then just sit down.</v>

714
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know there's.</v>

715
00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.210
<v Speaker 2>There's something about comedy clubs </v>
<v Speaker 2>though that's better.</v>

716
00:34:38.410 --> 00:34:43.410
<v Speaker 2>The setup is better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The low ceiling and the irony is the </v>

717
00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:47.051
<v Speaker 2>only way to make that setup work is </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to make money and liquor and </v>

718
00:34:47.051 --> 00:34:49.220
<v Speaker 2>the only way to make money with liquor </v>
<v Speaker 2>is you got to have waitresses to do it.</v>

719
00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Theater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you kind of.</v>

720
00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:55.540
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're just very different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably depends on what side you're </v>

721
00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.070
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I do four to five clubs a year.</v>

722
00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to just do some theaters.</v>

723
00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.040
<v Speaker 2>I would love to blow into a town.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Side note,</v>

738
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:45.290
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned kippah data because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with him.</v>

739
00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's obsessed with.</v>

740
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to wait.</v>

741
00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:51.260
<v Speaker 2>I have to watch what I say because </v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what I'm obsessed with.</v>

742
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.550
<v Speaker 2>But he like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been.</v>

743
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:57.240
<v Speaker 2>He goes after Internet trolls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess from what I'm,</v>

744
00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.030
<v Speaker 2>what I'm figuring out from other youtube</v>
<v Speaker 2>videos he puts out,</v>

745
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:05.660
<v Speaker 2>but he says people's names and phone </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers and he just goes and he does </v>

746
00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:10.701
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can come to my website and post </v>

747
00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:11.850
<v Speaker 2>something bad about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan.</v>

748
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:14.370
<v Speaker 2>Well I will tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't use my name.</v>

749
00:36:14.371 --> 00:36:17.830
<v Speaker 2>You call them candies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

750
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:22.850
<v Speaker 2>But he has like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has one video where he's talking </v>

751
00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:25.460
<v Speaker 2>about somebody pulls out a gun and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes out all the bullets and then he </v>

752
00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.950
<v Speaker 2>kind of looks through the barrel wise </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk.</v>

753
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.220
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

754
00:36:29.221 --> 00:36:34.221
<v Speaker 2>maybe scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I'm obsessed with talking </v>

755
00:36:34.221 --> 00:36:35.940
<v Speaker 2>about that off the airflow hanging from </v>
<v Speaker 2>a thread.</v>

756
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.090
<v Speaker 2>Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tend to be fucked up.</v>

757
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:44.710
<v Speaker 2>You think it happens when we get older?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're talking about like your </v>

758
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:44.710
<v Speaker 2>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

759
00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:48.560
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a lot of guys that just the</v>
<v Speaker 2>older they get or is it just trauma </v>

760
00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.560
<v Speaker 2>somehow we get head trauma.</v>

761
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:53.700
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think as the older people get,</v>

762
00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more likely to go crazy anyway.</v>

763
00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

764
00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:01.960
<v Speaker 2>So grandma and Grandpa weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't the same as when they were </v>

765
00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.790
<v Speaker 2>ready to call it a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a life,</v>

766
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:06.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandfather before he died,</v>

767
00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.350
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was sad.</v>

768
00:37:07.351 --> 00:37:09.570
<v Speaker 2>It was just like he was barely there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

769
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:15.440
<v Speaker 2>they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pupil people get real weird when they </v>

770
00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:15.440
<v Speaker 2>get old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

771
00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:15.440
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

772
00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:20.210
<v Speaker 2>my grandma's 91 92.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you have to ask her the same </v>

773
00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:23.511
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she started asking what my mom </v>

774
00:37:23.511 --> 00:37:24.270
<v Speaker 2>was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom passed away so I didn't like.</v>

775
00:37:24.271 --> 00:37:29.271
<v Speaker 2>Then I had to that conversation with her</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she got legitimately sad is if </v>

776
00:37:29.271 --> 00:37:31.620
<v Speaker 2>she just found out this information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

777
00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.360
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just this,</v>

778
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.620
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

779
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:37.980
<v Speaker 2>when they get Alzheimer's that's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>spooky.</v>

780
00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.530
<v Speaker 2>Whether they really don't know where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>

781
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:45.590
<v Speaker 2>they'll wake up like in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing things and not be sure where they </v>

782
00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:47.490
<v Speaker 2>are and they don't know people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've known for years.</v>

783
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.870
<v Speaker 2>Getting old sucks the fat one dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

784
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.830
<v Speaker 2>luckily we'll be young forever to tie it</v>
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>

785
00:37:55.831 --> 00:38:00.831
<v Speaker 2>What I was saying about Brendan is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that shit is coming worse if you're </v>

786
00:38:01.861 --> 00:38:06.861
<v Speaker 2>dealing with head trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the other shit that everybody else </v>

787
00:38:06.861 --> 00:38:06.861
<v Speaker 2>has to do with it was coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

788
00:38:06.861 --> 00:38:09.120
<v Speaker 2>threefold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully not.</v>

789
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully it gets out now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be all right.</v>

790
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.520
<v Speaker 2>There's a video of Terry Norris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody,</v>

791
00:38:14.521 --> 00:38:15.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about on the podcast.</v>

792
00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Somebody put it up on the message board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was or twitter,</v>

793
00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:25.460
<v Speaker 2>one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I watched again Terry Norris when I </v>

794
00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.870
<v Speaker 2>was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was like in my early twenties,</v>

795
00:38:27.871 --> 00:38:30.180
<v Speaker 2>Terry Martin Harris was the welterweight</v>
<v Speaker 2>champion I believe,</v>

796
00:38:30.181 --> 00:38:32.100
<v Speaker 2>or 1:54,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget which way,</v>

797
00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:34.920
<v Speaker 2>but God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tammy was good woo.</v>

798
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>He had this</v>

799
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:41.220
<v Speaker 4>fucking lethal left hook man and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he would get tagged a lot and </v>

800
00:38:41.381 --> 00:38:42.130
<v Speaker 4>fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would,</v>

801
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:44.830
<v Speaker 4>he would fight guys and get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get nailed.</v>

802
00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:50.400
<v Speaker 4>It happened a few times with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a just a blood and guts super </v>

803
00:38:51.941 --> 00:38:55.140
<v Speaker 4>warrior boxer born with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

804
00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.850
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to them.</v>

805
00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.920
<v Speaker 4>My point is that now he could barely </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk.</v>

806
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:05.010
<v Speaker 4>He can barely formed sentences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard to watch and you know,</v>

807
00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.570
<v Speaker 4>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't that old when you retired,</v>

808
00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:12.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like he was Bernard Hopkins </v>

809
00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.701
<v Speaker 4>fight and deep into his forties and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bernard Hopkins because of his skills </v>

810
00:39:14.701 --> 00:39:16.060
<v Speaker 4>doesn't really get hit that much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's fine.</v>

811
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.100
<v Speaker 4>He's 49 years old and he's fine.</v>

812
00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:19.400
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

813
00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:24.710
<v Speaker 4>I don't like reading books lately,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have just,</v>

814
00:39:24.711 --> 00:39:28.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to get like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've read this book called on combat and</v>

815
00:39:28.551 --> 00:39:33.551
<v Speaker 4>it's just basically talks about when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in a combat situation would like </v>

816
00:39:33.551 --> 00:39:37.751
<v Speaker 4>guns and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of people get tunnel vision </v>

817
00:39:37.751 --> 00:39:40.331
<v Speaker 4>and then you get all and like how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>work through that so you can not get </v>

818
00:39:40.331 --> 00:39:41.420
<v Speaker 4>paralyzed with fear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

819
00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:44.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I just do not have that thing like,</v>

820
00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:49.850
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean when it comes from </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it comes from overcoming </v>

821
00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:49.850
<v Speaker 4>difficult things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

822
00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:54.760
<v Speaker 4>it's like the idea that you just get it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you have it like a lot of guys </v>

823
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:55.460
<v Speaker 4>that have it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

824
00:39:55.461 --> 00:40:00.461
<v Speaker 4>especially like martial arts fighters </v>
<v Speaker 4>who talked to them like they've gone </v>

825
00:40:00.461 --> 00:40:04.031
<v Speaker 4>through a decade of college wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 4>and high school wrestling and tried out </v>

826
00:40:04.821 --> 00:40:09.821
<v Speaker 4>for the Olympic team and wrestling and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're used to like high pressure type </v>

827
00:40:09.821 --> 00:40:11.720
<v Speaker 4>situations and they're used to being </v>
<v Speaker 4>super uncomfortable.</v>

828
00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:16.780
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the big keys to success in</v>
<v Speaker 4>athletics is you got to be willing to be</v>

829
00:40:16.821 --> 00:40:18.500
<v Speaker 4>super uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

830
00:40:18.501 --> 00:40:21.020
<v Speaker 4>like you've got to get up and do </v>
<v Speaker 4>training that you don't want to do.</v>

831
00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:24.050
<v Speaker 4>You've got to work out when you're sore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And especially in MMA,</v>

832
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:26.780
<v Speaker 4>you know you're going to get hit while </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're tired of getting hit.</v>

833
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:29.390
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's a lot of factors going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

834
00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:33.020
<v Speaker 4>So these guys that can rise to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>occasion,</v>

835
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:36.950
<v Speaker 4>they've risen to the occasion a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>their whole life.</v>

836
00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:37.910
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

837
00:40:37.911 --> 00:40:42.911
<v Speaker 4>it's a normal state for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for a guy like you who hasn't had </v>

838
00:40:42.911 --> 00:40:42.911
<v Speaker 4>any,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

839
00:40:42.911 --> 00:40:47.710
<v Speaker 4>amateur mma fights are doing Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 4>class against black belts on a regular </v>

840
00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:52.001
<v Speaker 4>basis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not experiencing like very </v>

841
00:40:52.001 --> 00:40:52.001
<v Speaker 4>difficult situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>

842
00:40:52.001 --> 00:40:53.320
<v Speaker 4>they tense you up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

843
00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:57.020
<v Speaker 4>they become alien.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Jujitsu is a perfect example.</v>

844
00:40:57.170 --> 00:41:02.170
<v Speaker 4>Like I've seen people go from being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>type of people that were like super </v>

845
00:41:02.421 --> 00:41:07.421
<v Speaker 4>timid and like had self confidence </v>
<v Speaker 4>issues and then they started doing </v>

846
00:41:07.421 --> 00:41:11.171
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu and they'd got to purple belt </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Brown belt level and now black belt </v>

847
00:41:11.171 --> 00:41:11.580
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you meet these guys,</v>

848
00:41:11.581 --> 00:41:13.340
<v Speaker 4>like I have a bunch of friends that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

849
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.710
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not big guys at all.</v>

850
00:41:15.711 --> 00:41:20.711
<v Speaker 4>Like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're very slight and very like you </v>

851
00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:21.050
<v Speaker 4>would never think that this guy's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking killer,</v>

852
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:26.530
<v Speaker 4>but their technique is so good and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've become that guy over the course </v>

853
00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:27.650
<v Speaker 4>of like a few of them of course with me </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing them,</v>

854
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:32.890
<v Speaker 4>they become this more confident person </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's just a matter of going through </v>

855
00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 4>trials like getting,</v>

856
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:38.140
<v Speaker 2>getting beat down and then recovering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting like getting dominated.</v>

857
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:41.220
<v Speaker 2>Then you figure out a way to survive </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting dominated and fit out,</v>

858
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:46.270
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to turn it around a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit and then you slowly keep </v>

859
00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:49.871
<v Speaker 2>raising your level of ability both </v>
<v Speaker 2>physically and mentally to deal with </v>

860
00:41:49.871 --> 00:41:54.730
<v Speaker 2>various scenarios and challenges that </v>
<v Speaker 2>come up with different guys you spar </v>

861
00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:56.450
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think even what we view as comics like</v>

862
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:58.840
<v Speaker 2>that can happen because I got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

863
00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:04.150
<v Speaker 2>my shows when I go to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually people who maybe know who I </v>

864
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:04.150
<v Speaker 2>am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

865
00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:08.740
<v Speaker 2>or they're my type of crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even whenever I saw you guys a </v>

866
00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:12.671
<v Speaker 2>couple of days ago at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would show in my head like I went on </v>

867
00:42:12.671 --> 00:42:16.670
<v Speaker 2>stage in the first minute or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt my voice having that crack,</v>

868
00:42:16.671 --> 00:42:17.550
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

869
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.090
<v Speaker 2>I've done this for 20 my voice usually </v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get,</v>

870
00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:21.830
<v Speaker 2>but it's because I never performed </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

871
00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

872
00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.880
<v Speaker 2>the crowd that was there necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to hear.</v>

873
00:42:25.881 --> 00:42:30.881
<v Speaker 2>So I'm 44.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's some of the things I'm going </v>

874
00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:30.881
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

875
00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:30.881
<v Speaker 2>Because they were 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had,</v>

876
00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I had a moment of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then afterwards when I was driving home,</v>

877
00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.500
<v Speaker 2>the show will end up going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>

878
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:36.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to,</v>

879
00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.920
<v Speaker 2>I need to do that more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like throw myself in scenarios that are </v>

880
00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:42.500
<v Speaker 2>just in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just eat it.</v>

881
00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:43.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

882
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

883
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:46.790
<v Speaker 2>He needs to eat it so I can like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

884
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.040
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's one of the good things about</v>

885
00:42:49.041 --> 00:42:52.270
<v Speaker 2>a place like the comedy store or any </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of show where you're practicing.</v>

886
00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.960
<v Speaker 2>There's like eight guys on it and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can take some big chances with material.</v>

887
00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:56.840
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could.</v>

888
00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:01.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's like one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>places to come up with a completely new </v>

889
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:01.870
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>

890
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:02.600
<v Speaker 2>You have an idea in your car on the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

891
00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:05.060
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only one way to try.</v>

892
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:10.120
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll just throw this out there and you </v>

893
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.041
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sandwich it in between one good bit </v>

894
00:43:12.041 --> 00:43:12.320
<v Speaker 2>and then you slip this new one in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he'd throw some water on it.</v>

895
00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:15.080
<v Speaker 2>You see what you got?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What Ms Dot last time if you like.</v>

896
00:43:15.081 --> 00:43:19.100
<v Speaker 2>When was the last time you ate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like ate it mentally in your head.</v>

897
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the audience like the audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes doesn't know.</v>

898
00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.640
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

899
00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:25.580
<v Speaker 2>They think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh that was a great show in your head.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm super hard on myself.</v>

902
00:43:30.651 --> 00:43:34.700
<v Speaker 2>I had one last month I performed for </v>

<v Speaker 4>every two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every three minutes just to set it up,</v>

1034
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:51.870
<v Speaker 4>just to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to fuck around there and have some </v>

1035
00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:53.851
<v Speaker 4>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also just to get people to keep </v>

1036
00:49:53.851 --> 00:49:53.851
<v Speaker 4>going in that spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That spot.</v>

1037
00:49:53.851 --> 00:49:55.480
<v Speaker 4>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been some 19,</v>

1038
00:49:55.481 --> 00:49:57.240
<v Speaker 4>60 something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the brand?</v>

1039
00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:01.000
<v Speaker 4>It's been 53 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it is something crazy like that.</v>

1040
00:50:01.001 --> 00:50:03.880
<v Speaker 4>So 61 or something like that when it </v>
<v Speaker 4>opened.</v>

1041
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:06.430
<v Speaker 4>I can't think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some really old school.</v>

1042
00:50:06.431 --> 00:50:08.950
<v Speaker 4>Huge comedy albums recorded there too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1043
00:50:08.951 --> 00:50:09.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1044
00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:12.490
<v Speaker 4>I want to do my next special there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm committed.</v>

1045
00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:15.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm committed to doing specials in </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy clubs.</v>

1046
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm committed to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a different thing then.</v>

1047
00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm trying to do,</v>

1048
00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:22.540
<v Speaker 4>just because I think I might pay for </v>
<v Speaker 4>this special all on my own.</v>

1049
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:23.690
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1050
00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.420
<v Speaker 4>Film in a comedy club and just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1051
00:50:25.421 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 4>so that's just cheaper and it's just as</v>

1052
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.530
<v Speaker 6>just as good as walking around a </v>
<v Speaker 6>theater.</v>

1053
00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.740
<v Speaker 6>Let me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Theaters are nice too.</v>

1054
00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:36.870
<v Speaker 6>I think it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's better just I'd have a </v>

1055
00:50:37.281 --> 00:50:39.740
<v Speaker 6>better show because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's what I normally do.</v>

1056
00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:41.780
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I performed in theaters all the time.</v>

1057
00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.460
<v Speaker 6>Then I would probably want to shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Especially,</v>

1058
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:45.140
<v Speaker 6>although I have to say the burst </v>
<v Speaker 6>special,</v>

1059
00:50:45.141 --> 00:50:50.141
<v Speaker 6>he filmed at the tabernacle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is the same place that I felt my </v>

1060
00:50:50.141 --> 00:50:52.961
<v Speaker 6>last special,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the one before this one and the </v>

1061
00:50:52.961 --> 00:50:53.510
<v Speaker 6>tabernacle is a great spot for,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for doing standup.</v>

1062
00:50:53.511 --> 00:50:55.830
<v Speaker 6>It's not too big.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's only like,</v>

1063
00:50:56.940 --> 00:51:01.610
<v Speaker 6>I want to say like 1300 or 1500.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not like a massey hall,</v>

1064
00:51:01.611 --> 00:51:04.400
<v Speaker 6>which is like 3,400</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you get to that size theater,</v>

1065
00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:08.000
<v Speaker 6>like joey diaz and I went to see Louis </v>
<v Speaker 6>Black once we were,</v>

1066
00:51:08.001 --> 00:51:13.001
<v Speaker 6>we were playing the next night.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're playing on friday and he was </v>

1067
00:51:13.001 --> 00:51:14.630
<v Speaker 6>playing at the same theater on thursday </v>
<v Speaker 6>and we sat in the crowd and uh,</v>

1068
00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:19.690
<v Speaker 6>it made me realize like there's certain </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit that you can't hear the guy say </v>

1069
00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:24.020
<v Speaker 6>because everybody's laughing like you </v>
<v Speaker 6>gotta be really careful with like subtle</v>

1070
00:51:24.021 --> 00:51:24.410
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

1071
00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:29.860
<v Speaker 6>You got to make sure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you don't hear any laughter still </v>

1072
00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:33.670
<v Speaker 6>when you're doing something subtle.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So your timing kind of changes in those </v>

1073
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:35.700
<v Speaker 6>really big rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the rush of the big room was like,</v>

1074
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:40.930
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that most I've ever done was I </v>

1075
00:51:40.930 --> 00:51:43.130
<v Speaker 6>think 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>to some corporate event.</v>

1076
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:44.390
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't.</v>

1077
00:51:44.391 --> 00:51:49.391
<v Speaker 6>People showed up to see me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was a sammy hagar was on and steve </v>

1078
00:51:49.391 --> 00:51:49.391
<v Speaker 6>miller,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was on.</v>

1079
00:51:49.391 --> 00:51:51.140
<v Speaker 6>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you worked a sammy hagar and steve.</v>

1080
00:51:51.141 --> 00:51:53.060
<v Speaker 6>but what does steve miller looked like?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you even recognize him?</v>

1081
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:57.270
<v Speaker 6>A note because the album was only the </v>
<v Speaker 6>white horse like,</v>

1082
00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.690
<v Speaker 6>so by you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>teenage years I've listened to me.</v>

00:52:00.691 --> 00:52:05.691
<v Speaker 6>I've never saw what he looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He looked like a dad with a blazer and </v>

1084
00:52:05.691 --> 00:52:06.980
<v Speaker 6>jeans and just went out there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the thing about steve miller.</v>

1085
00:52:06.981 --> 00:52:10.340
<v Speaker 6>He is the least recognizable major.</v>

1086
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.740
<v Speaker 6>He walk around rockstar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He could walk,</v>

1087
00:52:12.741 --> 00:52:15.950
<v Speaker 6>run anywhere and it seemed like he never</v>
<v Speaker 6>tried to become famous.</v>

1088
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:19.550
<v Speaker 6>Or you're going to out him on the </v>
<v Speaker 6>podcast that steve miller.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>

<v Speaker 6>He had some fucking jams.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jungle love.</v>

1091
00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:29.060
<v Speaker 6>that was that whole album.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Reminds me of high school.</v>

1092
00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:32.390
<v Speaker 6>Take the money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And this is still about billy joe.</v>

1093
00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:37.600
<v Speaker 6>We thought we.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We thought we were cool too because </v>

1094
00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:40.050
<v Speaker 6>we're listening to classic rock that was</v>
<v Speaker 6>technically we're into this,</v>

1095
00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:42.650
<v Speaker 6>not this new edition,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1096
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:47.680
<v Speaker 6>it's really fucking weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went to high school in 1981 and in </v>

1097
00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.190
<v Speaker 6>1981 I started hanging out with these </v>
<v Speaker 6>kids.</v>

1098
00:52:49.191 --> 00:52:54.191
<v Speaker 6>I just moved into town into a newton </v>
<v Speaker 6>upper falls and I started hanging out </v>

1099
00:52:54.191 --> 00:52:58.331
<v Speaker 6>with my friend jimmy and jimmy and all </v>
<v Speaker 6>of his friends were all from the other </v>

1100
00:52:58.551 --> 00:52:59.130
<v Speaker 6>side of town.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

1101
00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:04.140
<v Speaker 6>they're all like the north part of </v>
<v Speaker 6>newton and they were all like everyone </v>

1102
00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:08.231
<v Speaker 6>adores tee shirts and they were all </v>
<v Speaker 6>smoking weed and it was like they </v>

1103
00:53:08.231 --> 00:53:10.670
<v Speaker 6>introduced me to all this music that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't even know existed.</v>

1104
00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:14.060
<v Speaker 6>But when I think about it now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the shit was only 10 years old.</v>

1105
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:16.310
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the allman brothers,</v>

1106
00:53:16.311 --> 00:53:21.311
<v Speaker 6>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were playing like some almond </v>

1107
00:53:21.311 --> 00:53:21.311
<v Speaker 6>brothers are some doors.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That shit is from like 1969,</v>

1108
00:53:21.311 --> 00:53:24.080
<v Speaker 6>1970.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So at the time were talking.</v>

1109
00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.470
<v Speaker 6>I went to high school in [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 6>one.</v>

1110
00:53:25.471 --> 00:53:26.820
<v Speaker 6>That was my freshman year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is,</v>

1111
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:27.510
<v Speaker 6>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Twelve,</v>

1112
00:53:27.511 --> 00:53:29.490
<v Speaker 6>13 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck nothing.</v>

1113
00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:34.140
<v Speaker 6>That's like some music from 2001 that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>contemporary,</v>

1114
00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:39.380
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a song from 2002 you could still </v>

1115
00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:43.140
<v Speaker 6>hear like on a regular basis that would </v>
<v Speaker 6>be on a radio station that was eighties,</v>

1116

<v Speaker 6>nineties and male sex and can day.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You could eaSily hear that someone can </v>

1118
00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:54.801
<v Speaker 6>play that non.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ironically on a regular radio station </v>

1119
00:53:54.801 --> 00:53:54.960
<v Speaker 6>they wouldn't be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh you remember this shit.</v>

1120
00:53:55.140 --> 00:54:00.140
<v Speaker 6>That would be a song they would play.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that sex and candy song came out In </v>

1121
00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:00.570
<v Speaker 6>like like 99 or some shit.</v>

1122
00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.700

1123
00:54:02.701 --> 00:54:03.780
<v Speaker 6>Like that.</v>

1141
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:04.310
<v Speaker 6>Completely crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's like never physically touched </v>

1142
00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:08.331
<v Speaker 6>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just that's not even a a process that </v>

1143
00:55:08.331 --> 00:55:11.331
<v Speaker 6>they have in their head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I asked five people last night if they </v>

1144
00:55:11.331 --> 00:55:12.840
<v Speaker 6>knew sissy space was and no one knew.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's insane.</v>

1145
00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:18.620
<v Speaker 6>If you haven't seen the original carrie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're doing yourself a massive </v>

1146
00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.160
<v Speaker 6>disservice.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That original carrie was a masterpiece.</v>

1147
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:22.710
<v Speaker 6>Is that brian depalma?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who made that?</v>

1148
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:24.770
<v Speaker 6>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was a good movie.</v>

1149
00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:29.900
<v Speaker 6>That was like one of the best Stephen </v>
<v Speaker 6>King adaptations and sissy spacey </v>

1150
00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:33.720
<v Speaker 6>knocked it out of the fucking park with </v>
<v Speaker 6>a light saber.</v>

1151
00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:35.700
<v Speaker 6>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1152
00:55:35.701 --> 00:55:40.170
<v Speaker 6>she was so crazy in that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like her character was.</v>

1153
00:55:40.171 --> 00:55:45.171
<v Speaker 6>So it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was something about the </v>

1154
00:55:45.171 --> 00:55:45.171
<v Speaker 6>ridiculousness of someone having </v>
<v Speaker 6>telekinesis,</v>

1155
00:55:45.171 --> 00:55:47.520
<v Speaker 6>but somehow or another she sold it like </v>
<v Speaker 6>you bought it,</v>

1156
00:55:47.521 --> 00:55:51.060
<v Speaker 6>you believe when she came out there with</v>
<v Speaker 6>that fucking pig blood spoiler,</v>

1157
00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:54.390
<v Speaker 6>she came out there and she had that pig,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they don't pick blood on her head.</v>

1158
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:58.950
<v Speaker 6>They played a trick on her to get her to</v>
<v Speaker 6>think that she won the uh,</v>

1159
00:55:58.951 --> 00:56:00.870
<v Speaker 6>the prom.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They all voted for it just so they could</v>

1160
00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:05.610
<v Speaker 6>dump blood on her head and she just tore</v>
<v Speaker 6>the city apart with her brain.</v>

1161
00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:07.980
<v Speaker 6>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>get out of here with this stupid fucking</v>

1162
00:56:07.981 --> 00:56:08.370
<v Speaker 6>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1163
00:56:08.371 --> 00:56:10.910
<v Speaker 6>that premise has been tried before and </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody goes,</v>

1164
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.640
<v Speaker 6>get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But in that movie it actually works.</v>

1165
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:17.520
<v Speaker 6>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a great movie.</v>

1166
00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:20.340
<v Speaker 6>Do you ever watch that show?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's now on netflix.</v>

1167
00:56:20.341 --> 00:56:22.290
<v Speaker 6>Carrie santa maria is the one that </v>
<v Speaker 6>turned me on to,</v>

1168
00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:24.160
<v Speaker 6>I believe in black mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Black mirror.</v>

1169
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.120
<v Speaker 2>Have you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1170
00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

1171
00:56:26.201 --> 00:56:28.960
<v Speaker 2>Just watch the first episode on netflix </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'll be hooked.</v>

1172
00:56:28.961 --> 00:56:31.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like twilight zone mixed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

1173
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:36.630
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the first episode is one of my </v>

1174
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.630
<v Speaker 2>favorites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>

1175
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:37.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why that is on in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1176
00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:39.180
<v Speaker 2>it's on bbc America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1177
00:56:39.181 --> 00:56:41.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I think I got it off of.</v>

1178
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:46.060
<v Speaker 2>I think I got it off a direct tv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of those instant plays.</v>

1179
00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:47.710
<v Speaker 2>You can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's on netflix.</v>

1180
00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.440
<v Speaker 2>It's on netflix right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1181
00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:50.890

<v Speaker 2>So amazing.</v>

1182
00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Like mayor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1183
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:58.190
<v Speaker 2>I think it might be right about </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology making like years seemed </v>

1184
00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:01.900
<v Speaker 2>quicker because we were watching an </v>
<v Speaker 2>auction,</v>

1185
00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:02.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those,</v>

1186
00:57:02.531 --> 00:57:05.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those car auctions was on the tv show,</v>

1187
00:57:05.201 --> 00:57:10.201
<v Speaker 2>the green room and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was in 2002 camaro and they rolled </v>

1188
00:57:10.421 --> 00:57:12.100
<v Speaker 2>out this 2002 camaro and everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1189
00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.290
<v Speaker 2>who fucking cares that thing out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

1190
00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:17.830
<v Speaker 2>nobody wanted it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were looking at is 2002.</v>

1191
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.620
<v Speaker 2>It only has 17 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason for that.</v>

1192
00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:25.060
<v Speaker 2>Do you know why would I get a 2002 </v>
<v Speaker 2>camaro?</v>

1193
00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:28.360
<v Speaker 2>What'd you can get?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A 2014 and it's fucking dope.</v>

1194
00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Or a 1969 and it's dope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird because I also,</v>

1195
00:57:33.371 --> 00:57:38.371
<v Speaker 2>I get jealous of new cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because their new cars now it's </v>

1196
00:57:38.371 --> 00:57:39.870
<v Speaker 2>because of the gps is in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory,</v>

1197
00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:42.460
<v Speaker 2>their technology that's in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I want that car.</v>

1198
00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Terrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1199
00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:48.260
<v Speaker 2>I have a really nice expensive car but </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an old oh six.</v>

1200
00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:53.580
<v Speaker 2>So the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cAn't even plug my phone into it and </v>

1201
00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:53.580
<v Speaker 2>well If you like the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1202
00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:55.270
<v Speaker 2>you can always just get aftermarket </v>
<v Speaker 2>stereo.</v>

1203
00:57:55.271 --> 00:58:00.271
<v Speaker 2>Those are so much better anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the nav system now they updated and </v>

1204
00:58:00.271 --> 00:58:04.430
<v Speaker 2>now embed it so much that I'm looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it right now to get the apple car play </v>

1205
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:06.270
<v Speaker 2>and my old ford edge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they embed the sink in like sO I,</v>

1206
00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:10.570
<v Speaker 2>I will lose so much if I get a factory </v>
<v Speaker 2>or I'd take out the factory,</v>

1207
00:58:10.571 --> 00:58:15.571
<v Speaker 2>like I'll get my oil change reports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my emergency gps thing that kicks in if </v>

1208
00:58:16.511 --> 00:58:17.500
<v Speaker 2>I've been in an accident.</v>

1209
00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:21.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh all that's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's annoying.</v>

1210
00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:22.680
<v Speaker 2>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1211
00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:23.670
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1212
00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.320
<v Speaker 2>you can't update the navigation system </v>
<v Speaker 2>on those cars either?</v>

1213
00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1214
00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:33.390
<v Speaker 2>It reAlly pissed me off because with </v>
<v Speaker 2>sync at least sync would update it </v>

1215
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:37.290
<v Speaker 2>within like the first year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there'll be updates and there'd be </v>

1216
00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:40.700
<v Speaker 2>sync is the word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then they just gave up on it and </v>

1217
00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:40.700
<v Speaker 2>then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1218
00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:45.091
<v Speaker 2>they just know they stopped giving any </v>
<v Speaker 2>updates and so my shit's like doesn't </v>

1219
00:58:45.091 --> 00:58:46.690
<v Speaker 2>even halfway work with my iphone </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1220
00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Louisiana market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an aftermarket stereo in the </v>

1221
00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:55.990
<v Speaker 2>porsche and I can download new maps and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can download updates.</v>

1222
00:58:55.991 --> 00:59:00.991
<v Speaker 2>It'll tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll send me a signal and then I could </v>

1223
00:59:00.991 --> 00:59:03.301
<v Speaker 2>just download it through the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the wifi on my phone or the </v>

1224
00:59:03.301 --> 00:59:03.790
<v Speaker 2>cellular connection on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty slick.</v>

1225
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.310
<v Speaker 2>Let's talk about all fast technology.</v>

1226
00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:10.600
<v Speaker 2>When you probably moved to los angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a thomas guide.</v>

1227
00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:13.400
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1228
00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:18.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised that they haven't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>made a doc type thing where you just put</v>

1229
00:59:19.181 --> 00:59:24.181
<v Speaker 2>in your like your ipad when you get into</v>
<v Speaker 2>your car and it turns into like a car </v>

1230
00:59:24.181 --> 00:59:25.870
<v Speaker 2>stereo and it hooks up immediate </v>
<v Speaker 2>automatically.</v>

1231
00:59:25.871 --> 00:59:30.220
<v Speaker 2>And bill burr had a fucking thomas guide</v>
<v Speaker 2>as recently as 2008.</v>

1232
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:35.650
<v Speaker 2>They'll do the hardest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fucking showed up at my house and I </v>

1233
00:59:35.650 --> 00:59:35.650
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

1234
00:59:35.650 --> 00:59:36.970
<v Speaker 2>He had a map book on his front seat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1235
00:59:37.020 --> 00:59:39.020
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking technology.</v>

1236
00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:40.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need it.</v>

1237
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:43.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need the gps.</v>

1238
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:44.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't need anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one where I'm going.</v>

1239
00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they know.</v>

1240
00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:47.930
<v Speaker 2>They know that watching will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know they're watching you.</v>

1241
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:49.490
<v Speaker 2>They know what your fucking car is.</v>

1242
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Cool with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're cool with them knowing where your</v>

1243
00:59:51.981 --> 00:59:56.981
<v Speaker 2>car is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That last podcast I asked if he was </v>

1244
00:59:56.981 --> 00:59:56.981
<v Speaker 2>still using mapquest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1245
00:59:56.981 --> 00:59:56.981
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd do it on the phone now.</v>

1246
00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Finally gave up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's got a phone that's like for </v>

1247
01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:02.710
<v Speaker 2>four years back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the character man.</v>

1248
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:07.930
<v Speaker 2>Thomas guys were were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine telephone books with maps on </v>

1249
01:00:07.930 --> 01:00:09.590
<v Speaker 2>each page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then the find your street.</v>

1250
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:14.650
<v Speaker 2>Remember you had to go to the white and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you had to get a protractor and </v>

1251
01:00:14.650 --> 01:00:14.690
<v Speaker 2>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you would all.</v>

1252
01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.720
<v Speaker 2>You do this all while you were driving </v>

1256
01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:30.581

<v Speaker 2>I remember now I did this college tour </v>

1257
01:00:30.581 --> 01:00:34.391
<v Speaker 2>when I was 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to go around the country and we </v>

1258
01:00:34.391 --> 01:00:34.391
<v Speaker 2>had a game show.</v>

1259
01:00:34.391 --> 01:00:37.550
<v Speaker 2>It was called crack me up and you'd have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pull a student.</v>

1260
01:00:37.551 --> 01:00:42.551
<v Speaker 2>You'd be a student and I'd have to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>you in a chair and then I would have a </v>

1261
01:00:42.551 --> 01:00:42.551
<v Speaker 2>minute to make you laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1262
01:00:42.551 --> 01:00:42.950
<v Speaker 2>I've seen something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can give you.</v>

1263
01:00:42.951 --> 01:00:44.900
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got 25 bucks.</v>

1264
01:00:44.901 --> 01:00:49.901
<v Speaker 2>If you laughed you got tee shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I did maybe 200 dates of this tour </v>

1265
01:00:50.391 --> 01:00:54.260
<v Speaker 2>just in a van with two other comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm driving around the country,</v>

1266
01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:59.380
<v Speaker 2>but we had a big rand mcnally map and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you'd highlight it and then you </v>

1267
01:00:59.871 --> 01:01:04.871
<v Speaker 2>would drive and when you got 50 miles </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of the city you would go to a </v>

1268
01:01:04.871 --> 01:01:08.130
<v Speaker 2>payphone and then called the school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was such a.</v>

1269
01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Like that was not that long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1270
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:14.960
<v Speaker 2>I know that sounds archaic there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got on the horse.</v>

1271
01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:18.260
<v Speaker 2>Did you have a goto move for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that show?</v>

1272
01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>

<v Speaker 2>have props.</v>

1275
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:24.370
<v Speaker 2>How many seconds did you have to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>them off?</v>

1276
01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

1277
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.610
<v Speaker 2>Thirty seconds or a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems like a lot.</v>

1278
01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:30.320
<v Speaker 2>It could have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

1279
01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Are you comfortable telling us what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>did?</v>

1280
01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.830
<v Speaker 2>You're comfortable revealing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>secrets.</v>

1281
01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So I put on like a random funny hat and </v>

1285
01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:49.841
<v Speaker 2>then I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then so we'd have like one of the </v>

1286
01:01:49.841 --> 01:01:52.541
<v Speaker 2>comics would go now coming out and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would say the character's name kid </v>

1287
01:01:52.541 --> 01:01:56.741
<v Speaker 2>given a book report on a book he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>read and I would just literally make up </v>

1288
01:01:56.741 --> 01:01:58.160
<v Speaker 2>a book report and just she would just </v>
<v Speaker 2>wing it.</v>

1289

1296
01:02:15.681 --> 01:02:18.740

<v Speaker 2>the wall would talk.</v>

01:02:27.790 --> 01:02:29.770
<v Speaker 2>all these colleges in like if we thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

1301
01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:33.240
<v Speaker 2>like a predominantly black school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we knew we were dead in the water.</v>

1302
01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:38.610
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of times we go because we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like three white guys.</v>

1303
01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.430
<v Speaker 2>one time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget mccook Nebraska,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we did a show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the basketball team comes and sits on </v>

1305
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:47.480
<v Speaker 2>the front row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>one of the comics we're with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1307

1308
01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:53.700
<v Speaker 2>half white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went out,</v>

01:02:53.701 --> 01:02:56.140
<v Speaker 2>he went after these guys just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1310
01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:57.420
<v Speaker 2>trying to make fun of them.</v>

1311
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:59.100
<v Speaker 2>Keep in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was nineties,</v>

1312
01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:03.420

<v Speaker 2>was that type of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he went after this a basketball team.</v>

1314
01:03:07.471 --> 01:03:09.480
<v Speaker 2>So we do the show,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and surrounded us and then they go to </v>

1322
01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:29.910
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys are going to fight.</v>

1323
01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.010
<v Speaker 2>we're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1324
01:03:31.011 --> 01:03:33.350
<v Speaker 2>we're completely dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I remember I was racking,</v>

1325
01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:38.400
<v Speaker 2>we were playing a nine ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was racking and then I grabbed the </v>

1326
01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.210
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were ready to go to war.</v>

1327
01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.430
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought we going to be killed.</v>

1328
01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:43.440
<v Speaker 2>I thought we were going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm like,</v>

1329
01:03:43.441 --> 01:03:43.980
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>

1330
01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:45.810
<v Speaker 2>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1331
01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:47.760
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better get out of town.</v>

1332
01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:50.160
<v Speaker 2>You guys better leave or you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>western,</v>

1333
01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:52.440
<v Speaker 2>a western.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in,</v>

1334
01:03:52.441 --> 01:03:54.690
<v Speaker 2>here's how I would handle myself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>western.</v>

1335
01:03:54.691 --> 01:03:58.830
<v Speaker 2>We ran back to the hotel as fast as we </v>
<v Speaker 2>could through all of our clothes,</v>

1336
01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:01.140
<v Speaker 2>just into one bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jumped in the car.</v>

1337
01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:02.700
<v Speaker 2>But we're in mccook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nebraska.</v>

1338
01:04:02.701 --> 01:04:05.340
<v Speaker 2>It's all corn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as we're driving,</v>

1339
01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:10.610
<v Speaker 2>we returned in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd see headlights coming and you're </v>

1340
01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:10.610
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1341
01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:10.610
<v Speaker 2>they're following us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where,</v>

1342
01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:12.300
<v Speaker 2>this is where we get shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they told you to leave.</v>

1343
01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:17.810
<v Speaker 2>If they were going to do something new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't have told you to leave </v>

1344
01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:17.810
<v Speaker 2>there would say stay right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1345
01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:19.710
<v Speaker 2>And then they would have just killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just beat your ass.</v>

1346
01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:24.890
<v Speaker 2>The only reason why they would say you </v>
<v Speaker 2>better get out of town as if they knew </v>

1347
01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:25.430
<v Speaker 2>that you were driving a long way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they could overtake you along the way,</v>

1348
01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:30.440
<v Speaker 2>push you into a ditch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then their cousin who's the cop </v>

1349
01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.250
<v Speaker 2>would stall on the way over there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>avoid some of the evidence.</v>

1350
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Who dodged the bullet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some statistics somebody put </v>

1351
01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:42.711
<v Speaker 2>up about how many people get killed by </v>
<v Speaker 2>cops and in what places like </v>

1352
01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.720
<v Speaker 2>albuquerque,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently albuquerque,</v>

1353
01:04:45.721 --> 01:04:50.721
<v Speaker 2>New Mexico is just like one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent places for like police and </v>

1354
01:04:51.181 --> 01:04:53.310
<v Speaker 2>civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like cops in albuquerque.</v>

1355
01:04:53.311 --> 01:04:55.340
<v Speaker 2>They've killed a gang of people like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>number.</v>

1356
01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Like everyone is going crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>berkeley.</v>

1357
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:59.280

<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

1358
01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:02.070
<v Speaker 2>They're stopping the highway like every </v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

1359
01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:07.500
<v Speaker 2>like these kids are just blocking </v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic on the highway and they're </v>

1360
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.041
<v Speaker 2>getting arrested in their live tweeting </v>
<v Speaker 2>while they're getting arrested and part </v>

1361

<v Speaker 4>There's all these kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're wandering through the street </v>

1367
01:05:23.610 --> 01:05:23.680
<v Speaker 4>signs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're fucking active,</v>

1368
01:05:23.860 --> 01:05:25.810
<v Speaker 4>they're active,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're making people think,</v>

1369
01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:31.410
<v Speaker 4>and is it possible now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not in favor of shutting down the </v>

1370
01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:31.630
<v Speaker 4>highway because if you do shut down the </v>
<v Speaker 4>highway,</v>

1371
01:05:31.631 --> 01:05:33.670
<v Speaker 4>there's some people that might be on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way to the hospital.</v>

1372
01:05:33.671 --> 01:05:38.671
<v Speaker 4>They might have some heart attack and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you lose your grandpa because some kids </v>

1373
01:05:38.671 --> 01:05:41.020
<v Speaker 4>thought it'd be cute to support that </v>
<v Speaker 4>support the ferguson trial in the middle</v>

1374
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:46.020
<v Speaker 4>of the berkeley highway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but is it possible that just knowing </v>

1375
01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:50.190
<v Speaker 4>that there's that much of a reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that people freak out that much over </v>

1376
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:54.331
<v Speaker 4>some shit that happened in Missouri that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it might make them second guess where </v>

1377
01:05:54.331 --> 01:05:55.330
<v Speaker 4>they pull the trigger?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say it probably does.</v>

1378
01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably does.</v>

1379
01:05:57.610 --> 01:06:02.610
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the shit that you're seeing on the </v>

1380
01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:03.490
<v Speaker 4>news on a daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time something happens,</v>

1381
01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.350
<v Speaker 4>people get in trouble every time.</v>

1382
01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.730
<v Speaker 4>Look at hollywood and highland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1383
01:06:06.731 --> 01:06:11.731
<v Speaker 4>the other day I can't believe that guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>got shot on right in the middle of </v>

1384
01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:12.610
<v Speaker 4>every.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1385
01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:16.630
<v Speaker 4>the center of hollywood in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody and the only had a knife.</v>

1386
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:19.840
<v Speaker 4>What happened with that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the official story?</v>

1387
01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:25.170
<v Speaker 4>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's still being investigated because </v>

1388
01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:28.450
<v Speaker 4>I've heard all sorts of ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy theories involved in costumes</v>

1389
01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:33.040
<v Speaker 4>and that he was one of those players </v>
<v Speaker 4>that pretends to be cosplay.</v>

1390
01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:38.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there was a kid who was a cosplay </v>

1391
01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:38.310
<v Speaker 4>kid who got shot with a samurai sword.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just see that.</v>

1392
01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:40.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some kid had a fucking samurai sword and</v>

1393
01:06:40.421 --> 01:06:45.421
<v Speaker 4>he was walking around pretending to be a</v>
<v Speaker 4>samurai and the cops fucking starts </v>

1394
01:06:45.421 --> 01:06:45.421
<v Speaker 4>shooting at him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Killed him,</v>

1395
01:06:45.421 --> 01:06:47.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't think he threatened anybody.</v>

1396
01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.930
<v Speaker 4>Do you think because it's aLl on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>news now.</v>

1397
01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:55.170
<v Speaker 4>Our cops like zero generation of cops </v>
<v Speaker 4>that got really shitty training that </v>

1398
01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:59.930
<v Speaker 4>like shoot people first or do you think </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's always gone at the same numbers?</v>

1399
01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:01.710
<v Speaker 4>We have now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just,</v>

1400
01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:06.580
<v Speaker 4>we've reached an age and with news and </v>
<v Speaker 4>now I think it's more that they felt was</v>

1401
01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.890
<v Speaker 4>all consistent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1402
01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:10.150
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if anything,</v>

1403
01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:15.151
<v Speaker 4>it's probably less now than ever because</v>
<v Speaker 4>some places are starting to implement </v>

1404
01:07:15.151 --> 01:07:15.730
<v Speaker 4>body cameras on the cops,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which should be mandatory.</v>

1405
01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:21.260
<v Speaker 4>It's a crazy role to role of having </v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimate power over another civilian.</v>

1406
01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:24.280
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>another another fellow citizen.</v>

1407
01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.940
<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy role and that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>power like the state.</v>

1408
01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:30.490
<v Speaker 4>We've talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you haven't heard this,</v>

1409
01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:35.820
<v Speaker 4>google the stanford prison experiment </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's all about how they had a these </v>

1410
01:07:36.161 --> 01:07:41.161
<v Speaker 4>kids and these one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one group of kids would play security </v>

1411
01:07:41.161 --> 01:07:44.371
<v Speaker 4>guards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other group of kids would be the </v>

1412
01:07:44.371 --> 01:07:45.130
<v Speaker 4>prisoners and they fucking went bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quick.</v>

1413
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:50.490
<v Speaker 4>People are gross like you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can't give that people that kind of </v>

1414
01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:53.770
<v Speaker 4>power like power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like to shoot and kill other people.</v>

1415
01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:57.610
<v Speaker 4>It's just people's default setting is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is pretty shitty,</v>

1416
01:07:57.611 --> 01:08:01.570
<v Speaker 4>but we just have just enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We changed the stuff a little.</v>

1417
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.450
<v Speaker 4>You also have to think that if you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with a cop,</v>

1418
01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:09.620
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a cop is experiencing violence and </v>

1419
01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:13.201
<v Speaker 4>murder and theft and robbery and crime </v>
<v Speaker 4>on a rate that the average person will </v>

1420
01:08:13.301 --> 01:08:17.960
<v Speaker 4>never know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You will never know wHat it's like to be</v>

1421
01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:22.961
<v Speaker 4>someone who every single night is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to war every single night.</v>

1422
01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:28.120
<v Speaker 4>You're dealing with bodies and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that had been shot and people that have </v>

1423
01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:28.970
<v Speaker 4>you fill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fill in the blank,</v>

1424
01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:33.971
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rape and murder and child abuse and </v>

1425
01:08:33.971 --> 01:08:34.280
<v Speaker 4>you're just constantly seeing horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>horrible things.</v>

1426
01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:37.370
<v Speaker 4>So when something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of these guys,</v>

1427
01:08:37.371 --> 01:08:40.970
<v Speaker 4>they're so ptsd out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have just fucking trigger finger.</v>

1428
01:08:40.971 --> 01:08:45.971
<v Speaker 4>They almost can't control their.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're experiencing like lifetimes of </v>

1429
01:08:45.971 --> 01:08:47.720
<v Speaker 4>trauma in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1430
01:08:47.810 --> 01:08:52.810
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a cop and you're in a bad </v>

1431
01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:54.281
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're experiencing a lot of fucking </v>

1432
01:08:54.281 --> 01:08:57.101
<v Speaker 4>shit and it affects people in different </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways and I think it's just an </v>

1433
01:08:57.101 --> 01:08:58.660
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably hard job to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1434
01:08:58.690 --> 01:09:03.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an unbelievably hard job to </v>

1435
01:09:03.690 --> 01:09:03.690
<v Speaker 4>instill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>THey get killed too,</v>

1436
01:09:03.690 --> 01:09:04.310
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1437
01:09:04.311 --> 01:09:06.200
<v Speaker 4>That's another thing you have to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>into consideration.</v>

1438
01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:08.840
<v Speaker 4>I think 53 people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>50.</v>

1439
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:11.380
<v Speaker 4>How many comps a year get killed?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was reading the statistics.</v>

1440
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:12.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to botch it.</v>

1441
01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.670
<v Speaker 4>We just found,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1442
01:09:17.690 --> 01:09:18.850
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my grandpa,</v>

1443
01:09:18.851 --> 01:09:23.090
<v Speaker 4>I guess I've never met him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a cop in detroit and was shot and</v>

1444
01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:28.091
<v Speaker 4>we somehow came across the tIcket book </v>
<v Speaker 4>that was in his pocket and there's a </v>

1445
01:09:28.091 --> 01:09:30.410
<v Speaker 4>bullet hole going right through the </v>
<v Speaker 4>parking ticket.</v>

1446
01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:31.790
<v Speaker 4>The ticket book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1447
01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:34.310

<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1448
01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:39.590

<v Speaker 4>though that 150 deaths per year.</v>

1449
01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:42.350
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred 50 cops per year get killed.</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

1452
01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:50.500
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>900,000</v>

<v Speaker 4>We're not,</v>

1463
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:14.780
<v Speaker 4>this isn't a judgment thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just trying to find the number.</v>

1464
01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:19.960
<v Speaker 4>How many people do cops kill every year?</v>

1467
01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:37.070
<v Speaker 4>It was a couple of different sites that </v>
<v Speaker 4>say it's 400 per year.</v>

1468
01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:41.080

01:10:56.601 --> 01:11:00.500
<v Speaker 4>A white police officer killed a black </v>
<v Speaker 4>person during a seven year period ending</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's a crazy statistic.</v>

1479
01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:13.890
<v Speaker 4>Two times a week for seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a white officer killed a black person.</v>

1480
01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:22.190
<v Speaker 4>Like at what point in time do we have to</v>
<v Speaker 4>say that there might be a little bit of </v>

1481
01:11:22.190 --> 01:11:22.650
<v Speaker 4>a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1482
01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:24.900
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How high do the numbers have to get with</v>

1483
01:11:24.901 --> 01:11:29.901
<v Speaker 4>crime and police and police shootings </v>
<v Speaker 4>and how high the numbers have to get </v>

1484
01:11:29.901 --> 01:11:31.650
<v Speaker 4>before people go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is going on here?</v>

1485
01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:36.770
<v Speaker 4>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many black people are getting shot </v>

1486
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:39.681
<v Speaker 4>by white cops?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many black people are committing </v>

1487
01:11:39.681 --> 01:11:39.681
<v Speaker 4>crimes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many white cops are looking to shoot</v>

1488
01:11:39.681 --> 01:11:41.200
<v Speaker 4>black people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what are the answers?</v>

1489
01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:46.790
<v Speaker 4>Like if you were the people that were in</v>
<v Speaker 4>charge of overseeing the police </v>

1490
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:47.460
<v Speaker 4>department,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they ask these questions</v>

1491
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:50.370
<v Speaker 4>but that will be like the first thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I would want to address publicly if</v>

1492
01:11:50.371 --> 01:11:52.130
<v Speaker 4>that fucking statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1493
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.060
<v Speaker 4>people started talking about that more </v>
<v Speaker 4>often.</v>

1494
01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:59.480
<v Speaker 4>Twice a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>twice a week of white guys kill a black </v>

1495
01:11:59.480 --> 01:11:59.480
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

1496
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.650
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that seems like a lot.</v>

1497
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:03.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean I don't want to laugh talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about that,</v>

1498
01:12:03.901 --> 01:12:07.500
<v Speaker 4>but that seems like a ridiculous amount.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's a good argument.</v>

1499
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:09.480
<v Speaker 4>And anybody that says that like you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

1500
01:12:09.481 --> 01:12:13.440
<v Speaker 4>that there's not at least the potential </v>
<v Speaker 4>for racism.</v>

1501
01:12:13.441 --> 01:12:16.920
<v Speaker 4>Like how could you not look at that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That number right there seems slow.</v>

1502
01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:20.640
<v Speaker 4>I think Just in los angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twice to two cops.</v>

1503
01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:23.400
<v Speaker 4>Shoot a black guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about that.</v>

1504
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:28.430
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were talking about killing 18 </v>

1505
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:30.471
<v Speaker 4>percent of the blacks killed during </v>
<v Speaker 4>those seven years were under the age of </v>

1506
01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:33.471
<v Speaker 4>21 compared to 18 or eight point seven </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the whites.</v>

1507
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:37.680
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1508
01:12:37.690 --> 01:12:38.460
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

1509
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:40.710
<v Speaker 4>it's a double problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is the thing.</v>

1510
01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:42.840
<v Speaker 4>Everybody wants to blame one side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's,</v>

1511
01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:47.900
<v Speaker 4>it's a double problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not simply a problem with the </v>

1512
01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:49.080
<v Speaker 4>police officers killing the black kids.</v>

1513
01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:54.530
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also crime ridden </v>

1514
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:56.010
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how to stop the momentum of crime ridden</v>

1515
01:12:56.011 --> 01:13:01.011
<v Speaker 4>neighborhoods and kids that are coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of those crime ridden neighborhoods </v>

1516
01:13:01.011 --> 01:13:01.011
<v Speaker 4>that commit crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1517
01:13:01.011 --> 01:13:02.220
<v Speaker 4>How do you stop that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

1518
01:13:02.370 --> 01:13:04.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe it's the children's </v>
<v Speaker 4>fault.</v>

1519
01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:09.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's the fault of a 16 </v>
<v Speaker 4>year old kid that grows up in an </v>

1520
01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:10.260
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably harsh environment and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes a criminal.</v>

1521
01:13:10.261 --> 01:13:15.261
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's his fault.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's an unfortunate victim of a </v>

1522
01:13:15.261 --> 01:13:17.880
<v Speaker 4>terrible situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think nationally we have to figure out</v>

1523
01:13:17.881 --> 01:13:22.881
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is causing that and if </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's anything that they can do to </v>

1524
01:13:22.881 --> 01:13:26.931
<v Speaker 4>mitigate that in some sort of way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a waste of resources and life.</v>

1525
01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:27.390
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1526
01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:30.970
<v Speaker 4>you're asking people to grow up in an </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment that's sold,</v>

1527
01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:34.030
<v Speaker 4>likely going to fuck them up for live or</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1528
01:13:34.031 --> 01:13:34.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1529
01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:38.010
<v Speaker 4>Or you have to do whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment asks or you're dead.</v>

1530
01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.320
<v Speaker 4>That a survival.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

1531
01:13:40.321 --> 01:13:43.230
<v Speaker 4>oh shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You really feel like doing this,</v>

1532
01:13:43.231 --> 01:13:46.740
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no doubt man.</v>

1533
01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:49.020
<v Speaker 4>No doubt is not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And everybody goes,</v>

1534
01:13:49.021 --> 01:13:50.000
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to choice.</v>

1535
01:13:50.001 --> 01:13:51.330
<v Speaker 4>You should fuck off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1536
01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:54.660
<v Speaker 4>If you live that guy's life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then maybe you could judge,</v>

1537
01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:57.840
<v Speaker 4>but you really don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know unless you live there.</v>

1538
01:13:57.841 --> 01:14:00.240
<v Speaker 4>And I'm just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just totally guessing.</v>

1539
01:14:00.710 --> 01:14:01.800
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1540
01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:06.860
<v Speaker 4>I just think the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimately it's a wakeup call for </v>

1541
01:14:08.251 --> 01:14:11.140
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of people that are</v>

1542
01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.340
<v Speaker 4>pretty fucking tired</v>

1543
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:14.080
<v Speaker 2>of the way things have been going in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this country.</v>

1544
01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:16.660
<v Speaker 2>You saw that video that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that boy,</v>

1545
01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:20.620
<v Speaker 2>like the boy with the pellet gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you know?</v>

1546
01:14:20.621 --> 01:14:25.621
<v Speaker 2>My friend justin told me that that guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>was fired from another police force and </v>

1547
01:14:25.621 --> 01:14:30.151
<v Speaker 2>they picked him up because he had </v>
<v Speaker 2>already gone through all this training </v>

1548
01:14:30.151 --> 01:14:32.431
<v Speaker 2>and they picked him up and this forest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had already decided this guy </v>

1549
01:14:32.431 --> 01:14:33.670
<v Speaker 2>might be like mentally unhung two </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

1550
01:14:33.690 --> 01:14:36.240
<v Speaker 2>So I think you see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian saw it,</v>

1551
01:14:36.250 --> 01:14:37.300
<v Speaker 2>but I don't pull it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>

1552
01:14:37.301 --> 01:14:38.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't want to watch.</v>

1553
01:14:39.010 --> 01:14:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I didn't watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't watch it.</v>

1554
01:14:40.751 --> 01:14:45.751
<v Speaker 2>I just read it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That two seconds they start shooting </v>

1555
01:14:45.751 --> 01:14:47.560
<v Speaker 2>them like as the car is moving still </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get it man,</v>

1556
01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:52.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I read you read the comments </v>

1557
01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:52.620
<v Speaker 2>and it's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if you don't,</v>

1558
01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:54.640
<v Speaker 2>if you don't want to be shot by the cops</v>
<v Speaker 2>then then don't do stuff.</v>

1559
01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Like somebody was kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like bagging and it'll keep it as a kid.</v>

1560
01:14:58.271 --> 01:15:02.420
<v Speaker 2>I remember running around with guns cap </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns and you know,</v>

1561
01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:07.060
<v Speaker 2>playing war we go said let's play war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course it's 12.</v>

1562
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:12.120
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely would have done it the </v>

1563
01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:13.861
<v Speaker 2>exact same thing and if I was in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation and I was black and I was </v>

1564
01:15:13.861 --> 01:15:14.080
<v Speaker 2>doing the exact same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might've got shot,</v>

1565
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:19.590
<v Speaker 2>they said he was scaring people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointing the gun at him and he's </v>

1566
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:20.170
<v Speaker 2>probably a disturbed little kid growing </v>
<v Speaker 2>up in a fucked up place,</v>

1567
01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:22.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean he has to get shot.</v>

1568
01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:27.510
<v Speaker 2>We were like the last generation to </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually have realistic army guns for </v>

1569
01:15:27.791 --> 01:15:32.791
<v Speaker 2>sale at toys r us at a point like in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties we had guns that looked like </v>

1570
01:15:32.791 --> 01:15:36.200
<v Speaker 2>real uzis rob banks with those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1571
01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1572
01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:39.190
<v Speaker 2>No orange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>orange thing.</v>

1573
01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:41.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that was like in the nineties or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1574
01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:42.650
<v Speaker 2>You can always cut that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1575
01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a dude with a drill for that </v>

1576
01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:49.000
<v Speaker 2>fucker out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make it look real.</v>

1577
01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:50.950
<v Speaker 2>We had a game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1578
01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:53.440
<v Speaker 2>I lived in a subdivision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably had like 40,</v>

1579
01:15:53.441 --> 01:15:55.360
<v Speaker 2>50 kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep different ages.</v>

1580
01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:57.400
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I created this game called tag.</v>

1581
01:15:57.401 --> 01:16:00.910
<v Speaker 2>It was from a movie town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the assassination game,</v>

1582
01:16:01.410 --> 01:16:06.410
<v Speaker 2>and we had profiles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had everyone in high school or </v>

1583
01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:10.200
<v Speaker 2>whatever grade we were in your school </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures and then I'd write brian's </v>

1584
01:16:11.261 --> 01:16:13.120
<v Speaker 2>home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what bassy road,</v>

1585
01:16:13.121 --> 01:16:18.121
<v Speaker 2>here's his address,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you'd pass out those profiles </v>

1586
01:16:18.121 --> 01:16:20.680
<v Speaker 2>and then you'd have to kill the guy that</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever you got.</v>

1587
01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:23.260
<v Speaker 2>And I remember the john dory come in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>

1588
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:27.100
<v Speaker 2>knocked on the door and my mind says </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody is there,</v>

1589
01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:29.800
<v Speaker 2>open it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's during he pulled out a gun,</v>

1590
01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:35.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of those ones that shot the </v>

1591

<v Speaker 2>suction cups under the plastic with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled up black gun pointed right in my </v>

1592
01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:38.140
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Shot me right in the face with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mom was standing right there.</v>

1594
01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:43.480
<v Speaker 2>Didn't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like a son just got ya.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But wall toy.</v>

1596
01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:47.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all walking around with guns,</v>

1597
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:51.190
<v Speaker 2>knocking on people's doors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pointing guns instead.</v>

1598
01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.410
<v Speaker 2>You're doing it with all friends though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you knew the dude,</v>

1599
01:16:53.411 --> 01:16:54.790
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the guys,</v>

1600
01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:59.791
<v Speaker 2>like if you got the profile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't know him well and you just </v>

1601
01:16:59.791 --> 01:16:59.920
<v Speaker 2>have to show up to him and shoot him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they were all playing the game.</v>

1602
01:17:00.490 --> 01:17:01.510
<v Speaker 2>You all looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1603
01:17:01.511 --> 01:17:06.511
<v Speaker 2>it was all like mob hits and that sounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun as long as someone's not genuinely </v>

1604
01:17:06.511 --> 01:17:07.540
<v Speaker 2>mad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

1605
01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:10.290
<v Speaker 2>someone like maybe like to grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other guy wound up where they are.</v>

1606
01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:15.730
<v Speaker 2>The only rule we had was you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot somebody on the way to school.</v>

1607
01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Like that was our big thing just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>

1608
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:23.050
<v Speaker 2>And I even bought a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had the spiderman things you put </v>

1609
01:17:23.050 --> 01:17:25.190
<v Speaker 2>around your wrist and you could shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rubber things through the spiderman.</v>

1610
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:28.670
<v Speaker 2>I wore that to school just in case </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody wanted to get shitty with me.</v>

1611
01:17:28.671 --> 01:17:33.671
<v Speaker 2>After school though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was actual weapons that you would </v>

1612
01:17:34.431 --> 01:17:39.431
<v Speaker 2>push,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where the spiderweb would come up </v>

1613
01:17:39.431 --> 01:17:41.650
<v Speaker 2>and it would shoot the rubber bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about those rubber suction </v>

1614
01:17:41.650 --> 01:17:42.660
<v Speaker 2>cup guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1615
01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:43.310
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1616
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:44.990
<v Speaker 2>It would shoot one of those so I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1617
01:17:44.991 --> 01:17:46.760
<v Speaker 2>So I had one shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a derringer.</v>

1618
01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Why do you have that up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to show you what he was </v>

1619
01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:54.251
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually have to do a thing called </v>

1620
01:17:54.251 --> 01:17:54.251
<v Speaker 2>street words where it's a whole city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty days,</v>

1621
01:17:54.251 --> 01:17:56.510
<v Speaker 2>24 slash seven water gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's destination.</v>

1622
01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's hilarious.</v>

1623
01:17:58.070 --> 01:18:00.560
<v Speaker 2>That's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be a fun thing.</v>

1624
01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:06.340
<v Speaker 2>As long as you're doing it with cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that aren't going to actually </v>

1625
01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:06.340
<v Speaker 2>kill you.</v>

1626
01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:09.220
<v Speaker 2>I remember making the profile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I would take your picture and then I </v>

1627
01:18:09.220 --> 01:18:10.120
<v Speaker 2>would with stencil or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1628
01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:15.160
<v Speaker 2>home office stuff we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would make a little profile and I </v>

1629
01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:16.880
<v Speaker 2>remember my dad going at wish you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend more time on your homework then.</v>

1630
01:18:16.881 --> 01:18:19.040
<v Speaker 2>Like I was obsessed with this game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1631
01:18:19.041 --> 01:18:21.690
<v Speaker 2>But your dad was incorrect because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1632
01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:24.260
<v Speaker 2>you gravitated towards fun and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're successful.</v>

1633
01:18:24.261 --> 01:18:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Standup comedian dad was totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>incorrect.</v>

1634
01:18:26.241 --> 01:18:27.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parents are often incorrect,</v>

1635
01:18:27.921 --> 01:18:32.921
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got to get out of your fucking kids way </v>

1636
01:18:32.921 --> 01:18:34.421
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then the other thing is I bet by </v>

1637
01:18:34.421 --> 01:18:36.020
<v Speaker 2>like not encouraging you to do stand up </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>

1638
01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:41.290
<v Speaker 2>Like you probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like by saying like you gotta get your </v>

1639
01:18:41.290 --> 01:18:44.351
<v Speaker 2>shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you spent all this time playing the </v>

1640
01:18:44.351 --> 01:18:44.351
<v Speaker 2>stupid fucking game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be doing your homework.</v>

1641
01:18:44.351 --> 01:18:44.870
<v Speaker 2>But by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by doing that,</v>

1642
01:18:44.871 --> 01:18:48.260
<v Speaker 2>like they put a little pressure on you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it makes sure that I'll show you.</v>

1643
01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:51.680
<v Speaker 2>Like some kids don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1644
01:18:51.681 --> 01:18:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you because their parents were</v>
<v Speaker 2>always super supportive,</v>

1645
01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.140
<v Speaker 2>so if shit goes wrong they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck to do.</v>

1646
01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:00.920
<v Speaker 2>My parents didn't know my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did stand up for like five years.</v>

1647
01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:06.010
<v Speaker 2>Really never even told them and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody saw me like at an open mic and </v>

1648
01:19:06.231 --> 01:19:11.231
<v Speaker 2>asked my dad and then my dad goes and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was you doing standup comedy and it was </v>

1649
01:19:11.661 --> 01:19:13.100
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was probably.</v>

1650
01:19:13.101 --> 01:19:16.340
<v Speaker 2>My dad was probably whatever the math is</v>
<v Speaker 2>my age now.</v>

1651
01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.990
<v Speaker 2>So just like imagine like you then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1652
01:19:20.991 --> 01:19:25.250
<v Speaker 2>it's so you think your dad was an hip </v>
<v Speaker 2>and cool and wouldn't want to be,</v>

1653
01:19:25.251 --> 01:19:28.910
<v Speaker 2>but there is a major advantage to </v>
<v Speaker 2>raising kids when you get older,</v>

1654
01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:32.690
<v Speaker 2>you know you have your shit together at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least a little bit better.</v>

1655
01:19:33.450 --> 01:19:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're 20 or 21,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I couldn't imagine raising a kid at</v>

1656
01:19:37.521 --> 01:19:39.210
<v Speaker 2>2116.</v>

1657
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:41.690
<v Speaker 2>That was a lot of people to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life wasn't 16,</v>

1658
01:19:41.691 --> 01:19:44.600
<v Speaker 2>17.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife was 19 when she had her.</v>

1659
01:19:44.601 --> 01:19:46.820
<v Speaker 2>God damn man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

1660
01:19:46.821 --> 01:19:51.821
<v Speaker 2>It's just what an unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility when you're barely and </v>

1661
01:19:51.821 --> 01:19:51.821
<v Speaker 2>she's in rome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nervous.</v>

1662
01:19:51.821 --> 01:19:53.340
<v Speaker 2>She was in the military and having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid.</v>

1663
01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.910
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're barely an adult.</v>

1664
01:19:55.970 --> 01:20:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Barely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean as an 18 year old or an adult </v>

1665
01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:00.970
<v Speaker 2>technically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1666
01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:01.820
<v Speaker 2>but we all know 18 year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like children.</v>

1667
01:20:02.290 --> 01:20:04.970
<v Speaker 2>You know the children that know a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit more than the average child.</v>

1668
01:20:04.971 --> 01:20:07.640
<v Speaker 2>They're just experiencing life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're still trying to figure.</v>

1669
01:20:07.641 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I</v>

1670
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:09.930

1681
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.930
<v Speaker 6>They're super fucking experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The kids of today,</v>

1682
01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:41.960
<v Speaker 6>they're super experienced in like not </v>
<v Speaker 6>just like physical experiences but </v>

1683
01:20:42.001 --> 01:20:47.001
<v Speaker 6>experiences like understanding like all </v>
<v Speaker 6>sorts of different points of view and </v>

<v Speaker 6>Like they're mOre informed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're just more on their brains are </v>

1686
01:20:53.361 --> 01:20:55.110
<v Speaker 6>working at like a higher level.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really believed that.</v>

1687
01:20:55.111 --> 01:21:00.111
<v Speaker 6>I've talked to some 20 year olds and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>feel like I'm talking to like a young </v>

1688
01:21:00.111 --> 01:21:04.191
<v Speaker 6>adult,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whereas if when I was 20 and I would </v>

1689
01:21:04.191 --> 01:21:04.880
<v Speaker 6>talk to other 20 year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was talking to mo ron,</v>

1690
01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:10.580
<v Speaker 6>other fellow morons who we would give </v>
<v Speaker 6>each other advice and tell each other </v>

1691
01:21:12.211 --> 01:21:14.940
<v Speaker 6>more ron facts that weren't real at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1692
01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:20.000
<v Speaker 6>that was back then.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's so nice to live like now if </v>

1693
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.470
<v Speaker 6>you have a random trivia question,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are you like how many cops were shot?</v>

1694
01:21:22.471 --> 01:21:25.860
<v Speaker 6>SomeBody you have access to that but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like back in the day guys at bars,</v>

1695
01:21:25.861 --> 01:21:28.520
<v Speaker 6>it would have to debate it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like nobody knew that,</v>

1696
01:21:28.521 --> 01:21:30.660
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>knew the answer to anythIng.</v>

1697
01:21:30.661 --> 01:21:31.470

1698
01:21:32.690 --> 01:21:37.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really interestingly if you play </v>

1699
01:21:37.690 --> 01:21:39.611
<v Speaker 3>video games nowadays because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're matched up with kids all the </v>

1700
01:21:39.611 --> 01:21:40.610
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're online talking to other adults</v>

1701
01:21:40.611 --> 01:21:44.160
<v Speaker 3>and then you have thIs like 22 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's an analytic guys I'm ready in its</v>

<v Speaker 3>They don't seem like kids anymore.</v>

1704
01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:52.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I gave up playing.</v>

1705
01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.670
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>

1706
01:21:53.671 --> 01:21:56.400
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's just a new reality.</v>

1707
01:21:56.401 --> 01:21:58.800
<v Speaker 6>Men is a new reality that we're </v>
<v Speaker 6>experiencing.</v>

1708
01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:00.140
<v Speaker 6>I had this guy on last,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>

1709
01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:04.490
<v Speaker 6>less yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's a futurist and he just a,</v>

1710
01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:09.670
<v Speaker 6>just kind of a guy who's invested in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>idea of trans humanism and all this </v>

1711
01:22:09.670 --> 01:22:12.720
<v Speaker 6>advancement of technology,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he was talking about how in 20 years</v>

1712
01:22:12.721 --> 01:22:15.120
<v Speaker 6>we may not even talk to each other </v>
<v Speaker 6>anymore.</v>

1713
01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:20.300
<v Speaker 6>Everything might be done through like </v>
<v Speaker 6>mind interfaces that work like the </v>

1714
01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:20.820
<v Speaker 6>internet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this,</v>

1715
01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:25.980
<v Speaker 6>this device that they recently tested.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were able to transmit thoughts </v>

1716
01:22:26.370 --> 01:22:28.380
<v Speaker 6>through the internet over like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1717
01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:32.040
<v Speaker 6>500 miles or something crazy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a very far distance.</v>

1718
01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:34.890
<v Speaker 6>And you wear this thing and like you </v>
<v Speaker 6>think,</v>

1719
01:22:34.891 --> 01:22:36.540
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>say if you think of hello,</v>

1720
01:22:36.570 --> 01:22:38.280
<v Speaker 6>you think hello?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you,</v>

1721
01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:40.200
<v Speaker 6>you keep saying like hello,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hello.</v>

1722
01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:43.770
<v Speaker 6>And it reads what your brain is doing </v>
<v Speaker 6>when it says hello.</v>

1723
01:22:44.100 --> 01:22:49.100
<v Speaker 6>And so then it recreates that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the person on the other end on the </v>

1724
01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:52.050
<v Speaker 6>internet has his helmet on and they hear</v>
<v Speaker 6>in their head hello.</v>

1725
01:22:52.410 --> 01:22:55.770
<v Speaker 6>And you're not saying anything like </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not using your mouth.</v>

1726
01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:57.900
<v Speaker 6>You're using your fucking brain.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

1727
01:22:57.901 --> 01:23:02.901
<v Speaker 6>you're sending a word through your brain</v>
<v Speaker 6>to someone else's brain through the </v>

1728
01:23:02.901 --> 01:23:03.780
<v Speaker 6>internet and it's really crude right </v>
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>

1729
01:23:03.810 --> 01:23:08.810
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if there's auto correct for </v>

1730
01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:08.810
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like think something switches.</v>

1731
01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:14.160
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If someone's got like a deep like </v>

1732
01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.110
<v Speaker 6>chicago aksana and that's what I meant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shock each cac.</v>

1733
01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:22.540
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck did you say?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was thinking that technology to even </v>

1734
01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:24.730
<v Speaker 6>drive and I had a meeting today that was</v>
<v Speaker 6>just like,</v>

1735
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:28.600
<v Speaker 6>I thought I wish I could just hollow </v>
<v Speaker 6>grandma.</v>

1736
01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:30.670
<v Speaker 6>Like at this point I'm eating right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1737
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:33.890
<v Speaker 6>but that'll probably be in our lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't like.</v>

1738
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:38.910
<v Speaker 6>I've seen technology biff of like cisco </v>
<v Speaker 6>was doing.</v>

1739
01:23:39.850 --> 01:23:42.310
<v Speaker 6>Have you seen magic leap?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Seen tupac?</v>

1740
01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:44.620
<v Speaker 6>Have you seen magic?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

1741
01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:48.680
<v Speaker 6>Magic leap is the new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's this ridiculous technology there.</v>

1742
01:23:48.681 --> 01:23:53.681
<v Speaker 6>There's a video that they show online </v>
<v Speaker 6>where a guy's his hands out and there's </v>

1743
01:23:53.681 --> 01:23:56.851
<v Speaker 6>a little baby elephant that is 100 </v>
<v Speaker 6>percent realistic and it's dancing in </v>

1744
01:23:56.851 --> 01:23:58.990
<v Speaker 6>his hand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like some new hologram technology.</v>

1745
01:23:58.991 --> 01:24:02.050
<v Speaker 6>It's just they're just releasing part of</v>
<v Speaker 6>like this.</v>

1746
01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:02.920
<v Speaker 6>It might.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who knows?</v>

1747
01:24:02.921 --> 01:24:04.090
<v Speaker 6>It might,</v>
<v Speaker 6>It might be a hoax.</v>

1748
01:24:04.570 --> 01:24:09.570
<v Speaker 6>The whole thing might be like pumping up</v>
<v Speaker 6>some fucking new movie that's coming </v>

1749
01:24:09.570 --> 01:24:13.471
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I actually think that this photo that </v>

1750
01:24:13.471 --> 01:24:13.471
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or this video,</v>

1751
01:24:13.471 --> 01:24:15.100
<v Speaker 6>I think this was just maDe to like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is what it should be like,</v>

1752
01:24:15.530 --> 01:24:17.520
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think it seems like they </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't.</v>

1753
01:24:18.130 --> 01:24:21.340
<v Speaker 6>They don't explain enough,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but watch this because it's so bizarre.</v>

1754
01:24:21.341 --> 01:24:26.341
<v Speaker 6>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guy has his hands out and as his </v>

1755
01:24:26.341 --> 01:24:29.221
<v Speaker 6>hands are out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this elephant starts dancing around in </v>

1756
01:24:29.221 --> 01:24:31.861
<v Speaker 6>his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Were going to pull up the video part of </v>

1757
01:24:31.861 --> 01:24:31.861
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1758
01:24:31.861 --> 01:24:35.371
<v Speaker 6>We'll just show it to over here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really crazy to watch and there's </v>

1759
01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:36.930
<v Speaker 6>another one where there's a little girl </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1760
01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:41.940
<v Speaker 6>look At this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He opens his hands up and look at this </v>

1761
01:24:41.940 --> 01:24:41.940
<v Speaker 6>elephant dancing around inside of his </v>
<v Speaker 6>hands.</v>

1762
01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:43.580
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>come on son.</v>

1763
01:24:43.710 --> 01:24:45.790
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>is that the thing is making shadows.</v>

1764
01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:49.270
<v Speaker 6>How's it making shAdows?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what is that?</v>

1765
01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:52.300
<v Speaker 6>Find that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Find out if that.</v>

1766
01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.480
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was the seventies.</v>

1767
01:24:55.481 --> 01:25:00.481
<v Speaker 6>We'd be at a bar and we debate it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why don't you google jamie google </v>

1768
01:25:00.581 --> 01:25:05.581
<v Speaker 6>whether or not that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because that sounds like no one knows </v>

1769
01:25:05.581 --> 01:25:06.730
<v Speaker 6>some new technology,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some new technology.</v>

1770
01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:10.850
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll figure it out motherfucker.</v>

1771
01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:16.760
<v Speaker 6>Like five years from now we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>be looking back at that and then it's </v>

1772
01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:16.760
<v Speaker 6>going to be something sIlly that I </v>
<v Speaker 6>remember.</v>

1773
01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:18.580
<v Speaker 6>We thought that was a real,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1774
01:25:18.790 --> 01:25:21.160
<v Speaker 6>what they're doing with this voice </v>
<v Speaker 6>technology thing.</v>

1775
01:25:21.190 --> 01:25:26.190
<v Speaker 6>If that really comes true and you really</v>
<v Speaker 6>can communicate through words in each </v>

1776
01:25:26.651 --> 01:25:30.310
<v Speaker 6>other's minds without talking and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no more spoken language and then</v>

1777
01:25:30.311 --> 01:25:32.680
<v Speaker 6>there's like a universal language that </v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody adopts.</v>

1778
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:37.830
<v Speaker 6>This is the idea that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 6>wear these fucking headset things and </v>

1779
01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:38.890
<v Speaker 6>you're going to go into a virtual </v>
<v Speaker 6>reality,</v>

1780
01:25:39.190 --> 01:25:41.140
<v Speaker 6>so you'll have this headset thing on.</v>

1781
01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:46.140
<v Speaker 6>Then you'll have like an oculus rift on </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you will like be in a meeting with </v>

1782
01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:50.350
<v Speaker 6>these people and you know they can have </v>
<v Speaker 6>avatars to represent who they are.</v>

1783
01:25:50.650 --> 01:25:55.650
<v Speaker 6>Like you can go into this three d,</v>
<v Speaker 6>virtual reality with this headset on and</v>

1784
01:25:55.961 --> 01:26:00.961
<v Speaker 6>see people and you don't even realize </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're fake until you try to touch </v>

1785
01:26:00.961 --> 01:26:01.330
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it have couches set up.</v>

1786
01:26:01.331 --> 01:26:06.331
<v Speaker 6>They could have a room set up where you </v>
<v Speaker 6>could have like a three d meeting and </v>

1787
01:26:06.331 --> 01:26:09.941
<v Speaker 6>everything looks exactly the same on </v>
<v Speaker 6>both sides as far as the furniture so </v>

1788
01:26:09.941 --> 01:26:10.160
<v Speaker 6>the person can come in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sit down,</v>

1789
01:26:10.190 --> 01:26:11.420
<v Speaker 6>talk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hang out with you,</v>

1790
01:26:11.421 --> 01:26:14.450
<v Speaker 6>and you literally will feel like you </v>
<v Speaker 6>were in the room with them and you won't</v>

1791
01:26:14.451 --> 01:26:16.040
<v Speaker 6>know you're not until you try to touch </v>
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

1792
01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:21.830
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going to be like the matrix </v>
<v Speaker 6>where everything just going to be gray </v>

1793
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:23.480
<v Speaker 6>and dingy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in your virtual world is going to be</v>

1794
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.930
<v Speaker 6>beautiful.</v>

1795
01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.100
<v Speaker 6>That the life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1796
01:26:25.101 --> 01:26:28.190
<v Speaker 6>and then that seemed so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's going to happen,</v>

1797
01:26:28.191 --> 01:26:29.170
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1798
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:31.700
<v Speaker 6>it will definitely have ruin the </v>
<v Speaker 6>environment,</v>

1799
01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:37.060
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If we ruin the environment and it seems </v>

1800
01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:39.281
<v Speaker 6>like we're kind of on that path.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's a lot of concern about </v>

1801
01:26:39.281 --> 01:26:42.491
<v Speaker 6>the environment now and there's a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 6>people that are making all these big </v>

1802
01:26:42.491 --> 01:26:43.970
<v Speaker 6>efforts so generation is going to get </v>
<v Speaker 6>good at saving the environment.</v>

1803
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.940
<v Speaker 6>Well actually that's not true because </v>
<v Speaker 6>Norway has zero,</v>

1804
01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.210
<v Speaker 6>zero garbage now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe it's Norway.</v>

1805
01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:55.420
<v Speaker 6>They figured out how to completely </v>
<v Speaker 6>recycle all their trash so they have </v>

1806
01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:55.430
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's Norway.</v>

1807
01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:59.270
<v Speaker 6>Let me find out Norway and have to </v>
<v Speaker 6>figure this out.</v>

1808
01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:00.640
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1809
01:27:01.130 --> 01:27:04.550
<v Speaker 6>Years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they use all of us.</v>

1810
01:27:04.551 --> 01:27:08.330
<v Speaker 6>I believe it's Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sweden,</v>

1811
01:27:08.331 --> 01:27:10.550
<v Speaker 6>Sweden runs out of garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>90 nine percent.</v>

1812
01:27:10.551 --> 01:27:11.690
<v Speaker 6>Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Norway.</v>

1813
01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:17.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to stockholm there in january </v>
<v Speaker 6>for a 99 percent of sweden's garbage is </v>

1814
01:27:18.621 --> 01:27:19.460
<v Speaker 6>now recycled.</v>

1815
01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:23.210
<v Speaker 6>That's fucking incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's incredible.</v>

1816
01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:28.900
<v Speaker 6>I mean that is like almost zero trash.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One percent trash.</v>

1817
01:27:28.911 --> 01:27:31.970
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw something on water.</v>

1818
01:27:31.971 --> 01:27:36.971
<v Speaker 6>I think it was a documentary about los </v>
<v Speaker 6>angeles or California running out of </v>

1819
01:27:36.971 --> 01:27:40.670
<v Speaker 6>water and they had some plant that had </v>
<v Speaker 6>sewage,</v>

1820
01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:45.700
<v Speaker 6>like literally it was sewage water and </v>
<v Speaker 6>an hour and a half later it was as clean</v>

1821
01:27:45.711 --> 01:27:50.711
<v Speaker 6>as bottled water drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have that drinking straw where you </v>

1822
01:27:50.711 --> 01:27:53.390
<v Speaker 6>can just drink and it filters anything </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they have like a guy,</v>

1823
01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:56.180
<v Speaker 6>like a video of a guy drinking straight </v>
<v Speaker 6>p out of it,</v>

1824
01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:58.670
<v Speaker 6>filtering it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How dare he.</v>

1825
01:27:59.690 --> 01:28:02.280
<v Speaker 6>Have you seen ian candidate?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The moving?</v>

1826
01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:02.870
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1827
01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:05.720
<v Speaker 6>The new one or the original one?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I've seen both.</v>

1828
01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:10.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's an interesting movie about how </v>

1829
01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:11.780
<v Speaker 6>they had implants put in and how they </v>
<v Speaker 6>can control.</v>

1830
01:28:11.781 --> 01:28:12.470
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and yeah,</v>

1831
01:28:12.471 --> 01:28:17.471
<v Speaker 6>I think I fell asleep during the new one</v>
<v Speaker 6>for some reason I was probably tired </v>

1832
01:28:17.471 --> 01:28:22.151
<v Speaker 6>when I was washing it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the first one was pretty </v>

1833
01:28:22.151 --> 01:28:22.151
<v Speaker 6>interesting.</v>

1834
01:28:22.151 --> 01:28:22.151
<v Speaker 6>The idea is pretty interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's like an,</v>

1835
01:28:22.151 --> 01:28:26.410
<v Speaker 6>an idea that always gets bandied about </v>
<v Speaker 6>and conspiracy theory circles like they </v>

1836
01:28:26.410 --> 01:28:30.551
<v Speaker 6>believe that someone could be in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>manchurian candidate and like the guy </v>

1837
01:28:30.551 --> 01:28:30.551
<v Speaker 6>who took out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>martin luther king didn't even know what</v>

1838
01:28:30.551 --> 01:28:30.850
<v Speaker 6>he was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1839
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:31.840
<v Speaker 6>that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1840
01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:36.970
<v Speaker 6>Jack ruby technology,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a cool story.</v>

1841
01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:40.700
<v Speaker 6>My brother in law was a hit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was blown up in Afghanistan.</v>

1842
01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:41.750
<v Speaker 6>He blew off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So.</v>

1843
01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:45.440
<v Speaker 6>So his quad got blown off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1844
01:28:45.441 --> 01:28:50.441
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it is that you've topped muscle of </v>

1845
01:28:50.441 --> 01:28:50.441
<v Speaker 6>your lake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kind of dumb about this.</v>

1846
01:28:50.441 --> 01:28:50.441
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the,</v>

1847
01:28:50.441 --> 01:28:51.860
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the quad got blown up.</v>

1848
01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:56.060
<v Speaker 6>So he's been in a wheelchair for four </v>
<v Speaker 6>years so far.</v>

1849
01:28:56.061 --> 01:28:57.050
<v Speaker 6>This is one that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 6>rIght?</v>

1850
01:28:57.530 --> 01:29:02.530
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>gained a bunch of weight and then the </v>

1851
01:29:02.530 --> 01:29:02.530
<v Speaker 6>created this almost</v>

1852
01:29:02.530 --> 01:29:07.020
<v Speaker 2>iron man bionic leg that he can put </v>
<v Speaker 2>around his leg.</v>

1853
01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:10.830
<v Speaker 2>And then there's like a computer where </v>
<v Speaker 2>your knee would be and it,</v>

1854
01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:16.100
<v Speaker 2>it moves his legs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent paralyzed in this bionic </v>

1855
01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:17.130
<v Speaker 2>leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moves his leg for him.</v>

1856
01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:18.850
<v Speaker 2>And then it also has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1857
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:23.900
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fall feature where it senses if he's </v>

1858
01:29:23.900 --> 01:29:27.681
<v Speaker 2>going to fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it locks up so it acts like a </v>

1859
01:29:27.681 --> 01:29:30.801
<v Speaker 2>kickstand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he was talking about that </v>

1860
01:29:30.801 --> 01:29:34.090
<v Speaker 2>they're doing stuff like you were saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you could have thoughts and </v>

1861
01:29:34.090 --> 01:29:35.940
<v Speaker 2>eventually control it to say move </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward or kick hard.</v>

1862
01:29:35.941 --> 01:29:39.210
<v Speaker 2>Like you can start to give it more now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of like,</v>

1863
01:29:39.890 --> 01:29:44.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stabilizes them so we can stand up and </v>

1864
01:29:44.890 --> 01:29:44.890
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1865
01:29:44.890 --> 01:29:45.810
<v Speaker 2>he walks with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean you got to like walk and hold</v>

1866
01:29:45.811 --> 01:29:47.940
<v Speaker 2>his wife's hand for the first time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>four years,</v>

1867
01:29:47.941 --> 01:29:51.570
<v Speaker 2>like standing because he's a big dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the biggest thing is,</v>

1868
01:29:51.660 --> 01:29:54.630
<v Speaker 2>is he just said hates being in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheelchair,</v>

1869
01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:59.840
<v Speaker 2>like going out because people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's always talking to people </v>

1870
01:29:59.840 --> 01:29:59.850
<v Speaker 2>like looking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You used to be in a big.</v>

1871
01:30:00.230 --> 01:30:02.430
<v Speaker 2>But the technology is pretty bad ass.</v>

1872
01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:03.990
<v Speaker 6>It's getting better all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>

1873
01:30:03.991 --> 01:30:08.991
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we talked about that on the show </v>

1874
01:30:08.991 --> 01:30:08.991
<v Speaker 6>yesterday that there's now a soft </v>
<v Speaker 6>exoskeleton suit.</v>

1875
01:30:08.991 --> 01:30:13.950
<v Speaker 6>They used to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they had these big hard exoskeletons </v>

1876
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:13.950
<v Speaker 6>with like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1877
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:17.561
<v Speaker 6>like metal pipes are rods down the sides</v>
<v Speaker 6>of it and joints and hinges.</v>

1878
01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:20.360
<v Speaker 6>The new ones are like way sleek.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They almost look like,</v>

1879
01:30:20.361 --> 01:30:22.100
<v Speaker 6>just like pants,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1880
01:30:22.101 --> 01:30:25.440
<v Speaker 6>and there are those things that make you</v>
<v Speaker 6>like live like strong way stronger.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You can,</v>

1882
01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.800
<v Speaker 6>you can do things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can go longer,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you can go up hills.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like for soldiers,</v>

1884
01:30:30.901 --> 01:30:35.901
<v Speaker 6>they're gonna enable soldiers to carry </v>
<v Speaker 6>much larger packs and they're gonna be </v>

1885
01:30:35.901 --> 01:30:38.100
<v Speaker 6>able to walk for much longer because </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's going to barely take any effort.</v>

1886
01:30:38.101 --> 01:30:40.620
<v Speaker 6>There'll be like 50 percent effort.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1887
01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:41.710
<v Speaker 6>pretty crazy,</v>

01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:48.540
<v Speaker 6>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's just an endLess amount of super </v>

1890
01:30:48.540 --> 01:30:51.960
<v Speaker 6>smart people out there that are </v>
<v Speaker 6>constantly coming up with new inventions</v>

1891
01:30:51.961 --> 01:30:55.530
<v Speaker 6>that we're just like every now and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>one pops up on your google news feed and</v>

1892
01:30:55.531 --> 01:30:56.790
<v Speaker 6>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

1893
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:57.420
<v Speaker 6>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1894
01:30:57.630 --> 01:30:59.760
<v Speaker 6>it's constant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's every day,</v>

1895
01:30:59.761 --> 01:31:03.570
<v Speaker 6>there's some new thing every day there's</v>
<v Speaker 6>some new breakthrough,</v>

1896
01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:08.780
<v Speaker 6>new technology,</v>
<v Speaker 6>new discovery that now they're saying </v>

1897
01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:09.120
<v Speaker 6>there was something that I tweeted </v>
<v Speaker 6>today.</v>

1898
01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:14.330
<v Speaker 6>They're saying there might.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The big bang might have caused a </v>

1899
01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:14.670
<v Speaker 6>parallel universe where time moves </v>
<v Speaker 6>backwards.</v>

1900
01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:20.040
<v Speaker 6>So we mIght have a mirror universe like </v>
<v Speaker 6>this universe is going this way,</v>

1901
01:31:20.170 --> 01:31:25.170
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's another universe that's going </v>

1902
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:25.170
<v Speaker 6>on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

1903
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:25.170
<v Speaker 6>Taken his sat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hating it.</v>

1904
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:25.530
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the opposite.</v>

1905
01:31:26.030 --> 01:31:31.030
<v Speaker 6>It's like the fucking earth has ended </v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's slowly forming back to the big </v>

1906
01:31:31.771 --> 01:31:32.700
<v Speaker 6>bang.</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1907
01:31:32.701 --> 01:31:37.701
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So who knows what time it is in this </v>

1908
01:31:37.701 --> 01:31:37.701
<v Speaker 6>other one?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If it's backwards,</v>

1909
01:31:37.701 --> 01:31:42.560
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who knows where we are in the life of </v>

1910
01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.271
<v Speaker 6>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We know that we're like 14 point 7 </v>

1911
01:31:44.271 --> 01:31:46.550
<v Speaker 6>billion years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so if we're for or whatever the hell it </v>

1912
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:48.651
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if the universe is 14 billion years old </v>

1913
01:31:48.651 --> 01:31:51.980
<v Speaker 6>that this other one is 14 billion years </v>
<v Speaker 6>and the total opposite direction is </v>

1914
01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:56.530
<v Speaker 6>right when we die,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we get reborn in the new world and we </v>

1915
01:31:56.530 --> 01:31:56.530
<v Speaker 6>never die maybe.</v>

1916
01:31:56.530 --> 01:31:57.520
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe qmap.</v>

1917
01:31:57.550 --> 01:31:58.090
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

1918
01:31:58.260 --> 01:32:01.990
<v Speaker 6>we assume that this is how time goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you know,</v>

1919
01:32:01.991 --> 01:32:05.570
<v Speaker 6>you do this aNd you do thAt and you move</v>
<v Speaker 6>forward and you cloSe your laptop to get</v>

1920
01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:10.580
<v Speaker 6>in your CAR and you say goodbye,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's only because that's how we've </v>

1921
01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:13.231
<v Speaker 6>always lived.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the idea of everything going </v>

1922
01:32:13.231 --> 01:32:15.220
<v Speaker 6>backwards is incomprehensible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if everything can go forwards,</v>

1923
01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:17.320
<v Speaker 6>why can't it go backwards?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I meAn,</v>

1924
01:32:17.410 --> 01:32:19.810
<v Speaker 6>who's to say that things can't go back </v>
<v Speaker 6>to their source?</v>

1925
01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:24.900
<v Speaker 6>Who's to say that like you can't like </v>
<v Speaker 6>start off in some sort of a neutral </v>

1926
01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:28.411
<v Speaker 6>position and have everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>instantaneously be you when you're 90 </v>

1927
01:32:28.411 --> 01:32:32.700
<v Speaker 6>and then slowly go benjamin button style</v>
<v Speaker 6>back to zero again and crawling your </v>

1928
01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:35.560
<v Speaker 6>mom's pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1929
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:37.990
<v Speaker 6>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you can come out of a person's pussy,</v>

1930
01:32:37.991 --> 01:32:41.030
<v Speaker 6>that's just as ridiculous as you going </v>
<v Speaker 6>back in it and,</v>

1931
01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:46.040
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and reentering the hive of the universe </v>

1932
01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:49.380
<v Speaker 6>is just as bizarre to come out of a </v>
<v Speaker 6>pussy than it is for you to become an </v>

1933
01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:49.830
<v Speaker 6>old man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then a child in,</v>

1934
01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:54.860
<v Speaker 6>you have this other organism that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>recognize as your mother that is going </v>

1935
01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:56.200
<v Speaker 6>to take you into its body and it's going</v>
<v Speaker 6>to absorb your soul,</v>

1936
01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:57.820
<v Speaker 6>and then you pass into the next </v>
<v Speaker 6>dimension.</v>

1937
01:32:57.821 --> 01:33:02.410
<v Speaker 6>Then you're born on earth in our time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Start over and start all over again.</v>

1938
01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:10.320
<v Speaker 6>Would you be happy if you knew you were </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to live your life as john heffron </v>

1939
01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:13.330
<v Speaker 6>over and over and over again?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Would you be willing to do this again?</v>

1940
01:33:13.570 --> 01:33:18.570
<v Speaker 6>If you knew that life really is like </v>
<v Speaker 6>some kind of a bizarre video game where </v>

1941
01:33:20.801 --> 01:33:25.801
<v Speaker 6>you're going to play the same character </v>
<v Speaker 6>ad nauseum to the end of the time until </v>

1942
01:33:25.801 --> 01:33:25.940
<v Speaker 6>you get it right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1943
01:33:25.941 --> 01:33:27.640
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because so it is like a video game.</v>

1944
01:33:27.641 --> 01:33:32.641
<v Speaker 6>If you don't make it past level one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you go back and eventually I would </v>

1945
01:33:32.641 --> 01:33:37.381
<v Speaker 6>love that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If there's a way you could talk to your </v>

1946
01:33:37.381 --> 01:33:39.310
<v Speaker 6>future or your past self to let you know</v>
<v Speaker 6>that what you want to know.</v>

1947
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.000
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes I think that's what days you </v>

1948
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:45.000
<v Speaker 6>have a movement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you haven't deja vu,</v>

1949
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:45.940
<v Speaker 6>it's because you've done this a billion </v>
<v Speaker 6>times.</v>

1950
01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:47.180
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1951
01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:52.220
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they have a scientific </v>

1952
01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:52.220
<v Speaker 6>explanation for vu.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I forgot what it is.</v>

1953
01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:53.200
<v Speaker 6>It's something about your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just.</v>

1954
01:33:53.201 --> 01:33:55.210
<v Speaker 6>It's like a half secoNd.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Taking the info.</v>

1955
01:33:55.290 --> 01:33:56.870
<v Speaker 6>Are we guessing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a backfire against.</v>

1956
01:33:57.390 --> 01:34:02.110
<v Speaker 6>Why are we guessing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Explanation idiots,</v>

1957
01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:06.370
<v Speaker 6>because we're all had passed at 70.</v>
<v Speaker 6>At a bar date.</v>

1958
01:34:07.650 --> 01:34:10.060
<v Speaker 6>Your watch is going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not what it is.</v>

1959
01:34:13.330 --> 01:34:15.070
<v Speaker 6>How stuff works.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is deja vu?</v>

1960
01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:17.770
<v Speaker 6>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The term dejA vu.</v>

1961
01:34:18.610 --> 01:34:23.610
<v Speaker 6>It's french and it means literally </v>
<v Speaker 6>already seen those who have experienced </v>

1962
01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:28.891
<v Speaker 6>the feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Describe it as an overwhelming sense of </v>

1963
01:34:28.891 --> 01:34:28.891
<v Speaker 6>familiarity.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what we all feel.</v>

1964
01:34:28.891 --> 01:34:28.891
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1965
01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:30.910
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's see what the reason is.</v>

1966
01:34:30.911 --> 01:34:34.810
<v Speaker 6>The phenomenon is rather complex.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are many different theories.</v>

1967
01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:36.400
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so no one really knows.</v>

1968
01:34:36.490 --> 01:34:41.490
<v Speaker 6>Swiss scholar arthur hottest guys name </v>
<v Speaker 6>ready for this swiss scholar,</v>

1969
01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:45.850

<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>arthur funkhouser.</v>

1972
01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:55.560
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that would be the greatest character in </v>

1973
01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:57.451
<v Speaker 6>a movie ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The funkhouser a classic rock dj arthur </v>

1974
01:34:57.531 --> 01:34:59.690
<v Speaker 6>funkhouser was going to tell you about </v>
<v Speaker 6>deja vu.</v>

1975
01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:02.530
<v Speaker 6>how crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Get them on your podcast.</v>

1976
01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:04.970
<v Speaker 6>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have that guy on.</v>

1977
01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:06.710
<v Speaker 6>I know he will.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He lives in Switzerland.</v>

1978
01:35:06.711 --> 01:35:07.640
<v Speaker 6>Maybe I can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1979
01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:08.990
<v Speaker 6>we won them over there.</v>

1980
01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:13.310
<v Speaker 6>He asserts that in order to better study</v>
<v Speaker 6>the phenomenon,</v>

1981
01:35:13.311 --> 01:35:16.100
<v Speaker 6>the nuances between the experiences need</v>
<v Speaker 6>to be noted.</v>

1982
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:20.690
<v Speaker 6>The examples mentioned above.</v>
<v Speaker 6>funkhouser would describe the first.</v>

1983
01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:22.130
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so there's a bunch of.</v>

1984
01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:25.430
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They believe there are several different</v>

1985
01:35:25.431 --> 01:35:28.920
<v Speaker 6>deja experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's deja visit tei,</v>

1986
01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:33.180
<v Speaker 6>which means already visited.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's deja vec who,</v>

1987
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:35.060
<v Speaker 6>ecu.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if I'm saying it right,</v>

1988
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:40.270
<v Speaker 6>already experienced or lived through as </v>
<v Speaker 6>much as 70 percent of the population </v>

1989
01:35:40.270 --> 01:35:42.370
<v Speaker 6>reports.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Having experienced some form of deja vu.</v>

1990
01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:47.480
<v Speaker 6>A higher number of incidents occur and </v>
<v Speaker 6>people 15 to 25 years of age.</v>

1991
01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:50.870
<v Speaker 6>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's bizarre.</v>

1992
01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:56.140
<v Speaker 6>It's been firmly associated with </v>
<v Speaker 6>temporal lobe epilepsy.</v>

1993
01:35:57.350 --> 01:36:02.350
<v Speaker 6>Reportedly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>deja vu can occur just prior to a </v>

1994
01:36:02.350 --> 01:36:05.260
<v Speaker 6>temporal lobe seizure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it doesn't mean that it's exclusively</v>

1995
01:36:05.901 --> 01:36:10.130
<v Speaker 6>connected to temporal lobe epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that it's connected to to.</v>

1996
01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:15.131
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for some people have temporal lobe </v>

1997
01:36:15.131 --> 01:36:15.131
<v Speaker 6>epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they experienced age.</v>

1998
01:36:15.131 --> 01:36:17.320
<v Speaker 6>I will not necessarily the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just because you have deja vu,</v>

1999
01:36:17.410 --> 01:36:18.950
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't mean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's what they're saying.</v>

2000
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:20.480
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck dude?</v>

2001
01:36:20.690 --> 01:36:23.120
<v Speaker 6>So they don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not as romantic when people go.</v>

2002
01:36:23.121 --> 01:36:25.850
<v Speaker 6>I just feel like we've been here before </v>
<v Speaker 6>together.</v>

2003
01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:27.800
<v Speaker 6>It's instead of night,</v>
<v Speaker 6>go ahead.</v>

2004
01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:32.120
<v Speaker 6>Kind of feels like a temporal lobe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think our software is just bugged.</v>

2005
01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:32.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2006
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:37.300
<v Speaker 6>I always associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2007
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:40.040
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with simulation theory,</v>

2008
01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:41.290
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2009
01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.190
<v Speaker 6>the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>

2010
01:36:43.191 --> 01:36:44.990
<v Speaker 6>just the idea that you could have </v>
<v Speaker 6>dreams,</v>

2011
01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:46.100
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can have dreams.</v>

2012
01:36:46.101 --> 01:36:51.101
<v Speaker 6>Like I wrote about this dream.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm an instagram because I was in vegas </v>

2013
01:36:51.101 --> 01:36:53.780
<v Speaker 6>and I passed by this thing and they had </v>
<v Speaker 6>this wall,</v>

2014
01:36:53.781 --> 01:36:58.781
<v Speaker 6>this hotel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they would write down famous quotes </v>

2015
01:36:58.781 --> 01:36:58.781
<v Speaker 6>everyday on the wall and one of them </v>
<v Speaker 6>said,</v>

2016
01:36:58.781 --> 01:37:00.110
<v Speaker 6>if you can dream it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can do it.</v>

2017
01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:01.250
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went to sleep.</v>

2018
01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:06.260
<v Speaker 6>I took four alpha brain that day kind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I went to sleep and I had this dream of </v>

2019
01:37:06.460 --> 01:37:11.120
<v Speaker 6>a sex dream with mermaids.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I put it on my instagram.</v>

2020
01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:15.200
<v Speaker 6>I had a dream that I could breathe </v>
<v Speaker 6>underwater and I dove into the ocean and</v>

2021
01:37:15.201 --> 01:37:17.150
<v Speaker 6>found a civilization of beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 6>mermaids.</v>

2022
01:37:17.540 --> 01:37:21.080
<v Speaker 6>They all sang gloria songs and </v>
<v Speaker 6>surrounded me with loving hugs.</v>

2023
01:37:21.230 --> 01:37:26.230
<v Speaker 6>One of them reached into my pants and </v>
<v Speaker 6>start jerking me off under the day long </v>

2024
01:37:27.711 --> 01:37:31.250
<v Speaker 6>continuous streams of beautiful flowers </v>
<v Speaker 6>came out of my dick and filled the water</v>

2025
01:37:31.251 --> 01:37:32.630
<v Speaker 6>around us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then I wrote,</v>

2026
01:37:32.631 --> 01:37:37.631
<v Speaker 6>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>walt disney didn't know what the fuck </v>

2027
01:37:37.631 --> 01:37:37.631
<v Speaker 6>you're talking about it.</v>

2028
01:37:37.631 --> 01:37:38.030
<v Speaker 6>It's like those dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a real dream.</v>

2029
01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:40.730
<v Speaker 6>Just think about that dream like that </v>
<v Speaker 6>was a very realistic,</v>

2030
01:37:40.731 --> 01:37:43.040
<v Speaker 6>vivid dream,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a dream like that.</v>

2031
01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:46.100
<v Speaker 6>What is what's going on there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2032
01:37:46.101 --> 01:37:51.101
<v Speaker 6>Obviously it's not really happening,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when you're having a really vivid </v>

2033
01:37:51.101 --> 01:37:53.150
<v Speaker 6>dream that's completely ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you're in a fucking avatar dragon.</v>

2034
01:37:53.151 --> 01:37:56.370
<v Speaker 6>You're flying around while that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>happening,</v>

2035
01:37:56.410 --> 01:37:57.310
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

2036
01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:59.830
<v Speaker 6>you're essentially thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2037
01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:01.140
<v Speaker 6>While you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>While it's.</v>

2038
01:38:01.141 --> 01:38:06.141
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it just shows you how slippery regular </v>

2039
01:38:06.141 --> 01:38:09.231
<v Speaker 6>reality really is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you can have these experiences that </v>

2040
01:38:09.231 --> 01:38:09.750
<v Speaker 6>are totally ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but yet while they're happening,</v>

2041
01:38:09.751 --> 01:38:11.340
<v Speaker 6>you buy them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know you,</v>

2042
01:38:11.341 --> 01:38:16.341
<v Speaker 6>you buy that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You and your friend really are running </v>

2043

<v Speaker 6>I really thought god godzilla's is real.</v>

2053
01:38:38.610 --> 01:38:40.200
<v Speaker 6>I had my,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

2054
01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:45.260
<v Speaker 6>I'm not stressed about anything but I </v>
<v Speaker 6>had my reoccurring dream that I've had </v>

2055
01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:49.581
<v Speaker 6>since I was like a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was basically somebody shows up at my</v>

2056
01:38:50.431 --> 01:38:55.431
<v Speaker 6>window suddenly like a appear in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>window like that and I start running </v>

2057
01:38:55.431 --> 01:38:59.601
<v Speaker 6>from him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'll run up the stairs and then </v>

2058
01:38:59.601 --> 01:39:01.461
<v Speaker 6>there'll be a ceiling panel and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll push it and then I'll pull myself </v>

2059
01:39:01.461 --> 01:39:04.941
<v Speaker 6>up and then I'm in like an attic and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then I'll run and there'll be another </v>

2060
01:39:04.941 --> 01:39:04.941
<v Speaker 6>little door and I'll slide that.</v>

2061
01:39:04.941 --> 01:39:08.820
<v Speaker 6>So I'm consTantly running from somebody </v>
<v Speaker 6>who's below,</v>

2062
01:39:08.821 --> 01:39:13.821
<v Speaker 6>but I have all these secret passages.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then I was watching the discovery </v>

2063
01:39:13.821 --> 01:39:14.070
<v Speaker 6>channel and they had a thing about </v>
<v Speaker 6>ninjas.</v>

2064
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:17.640
<v Speaker 6>This ninja house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guy got out,</v>

2065
01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:20.790
<v Speaker 6>he would move a sliding panel and he </v>
<v Speaker 6>went through and I go,</v>

2066
01:39:20.791 --> 01:39:22.710
<v Speaker 6>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why I enjoy fighting.</v>

2067
01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:24.930
<v Speaker 6>That's why I'm having this dream.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was in ninja.</v>

2068
01:39:25.170 --> 01:39:30.170
<v Speaker 6>Not kidding you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The thing they showed in thing was the </v>

2069
01:39:30.170 --> 01:39:33.681
<v Speaker 6>exact dream that I've had.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that that happens in almost </v>

2070
01:39:33.681 --> 01:39:36.990
<v Speaker 6>every ninja movie.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know you've seen ninja movies.</v>

2071
01:39:36.991 --> 01:39:40.410
<v Speaker 6>that is a much better explanation than </v>
<v Speaker 6>you used to be.</v>

2072
01:39:40.411 --> 01:39:43.230
<v Speaker 6>A japanese dude back in the days where </v>
<v Speaker 6>there really were ninjas.</v>

2073
01:39:43.410 --> 01:39:45.420
<v Speaker 6>That seems like a bunch of generations </v>
<v Speaker 6>ago,</v>

2074
01:39:45.421 --> 01:39:46.770
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What happened last life?</v>

2075
01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:52.220
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How come you remember that shit was </v>

2076
01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:52.220
<v Speaker 6>probably what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The forties.</v>

2077
01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:52.440
<v Speaker 6>It was kind of boring.</v>

2078
01:39:53.550 --> 01:39:58.550
<v Speaker 6>I think they have a photo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a photo that was just going </v>

2079
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.550
<v Speaker 6>around recently.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Brian,</v>

2080
01:39:58.550 --> 01:40:02.210
<v Speaker 6>see if you can pull this up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the last known photo of a samurai </v>

2081
01:40:02.210 --> 01:40:04.530
<v Speaker 6>and actual samurai before they somehow </v>
<v Speaker 6>or another,</v>

2082
01:40:04.531 --> 01:40:06.600
<v Speaker 6>the culture was abolished.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how they did that.</v>

2083
01:40:06.650 --> 01:40:11.650
<v Speaker 6>I mean they made it illegal to walk </v>
<v Speaker 6>around with swords or I don't know what </v>

2084
01:40:11.650 --> 01:40:11.650
<v Speaker 6>they did,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but this is a.</v>

2085
01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:16.660
<v Speaker 6>I think photographS were discovered or </v>
<v Speaker 6>were figured out in the late 18 </v>

2086
01:40:17.461 --> 01:40:18.480
<v Speaker 6>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I believe.</v>

2087
01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:19.620
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>was that right?</v>

2088
01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:24.480
<v Speaker 6>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So this guy existed with swords.</v>

2089
01:40:24.740 --> 01:40:29.740
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm walking around with a sword in the </v>

2090
01:40:29.740 --> 01:40:31.281
<v Speaker 6>18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure this is the google </v>

2091
01:40:31.281 --> 01:40:32.390
<v Speaker 6>episode john had put them on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm wondering,</v>

2092
01:40:32.391 --> 01:40:35.230
<v Speaker 6>you're dumber guests so I can't drop a </v>
<v Speaker 6>lot of those.</v>

2093
01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:37.710
<v Speaker 6>So not true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not the photo that I saw,</v>

2094
01:40:38.250 --> 01:40:40.470
<v Speaker 6>but it might be another one that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>similar.</v>

2095
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:45.470
<v Speaker 6>This last known photo of a samurai.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See if you google that will look at </v>

2096
01:40:45.470 --> 01:40:45.470
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dude,</v>

2097
01:40:46.950 --> 01:40:51.950
<v Speaker 6>that's what I googled.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You ever see those ninja classes like </v>

2098
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:55.690
<v Speaker 6>that ain't the one I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's still pretty dope in martial </v>

2099
01:40:55.690 --> 01:40:56.410
<v Speaker 6>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like magazines or even online.</v>

2100
01:40:56.411 --> 01:40:58.480
<v Speaker 6>There's like guys that teach you how to </v>
<v Speaker 6>be a ninja.</v>

2101
01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:04.920
<v Speaker 6>They teach you how to send you a ninja </v>
<v Speaker 6>black belt and then you have to promise </v>

2102
01:41:05.441 --> 01:41:06.910
<v Speaker 6>you're going to watch the videos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm serious.</v>

2103
01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:12.040
<v Speaker 6>I saw like a native american martial </v>
<v Speaker 6>art,</v>

2104
01:41:12.041 --> 01:41:14.260
<v Speaker 6>it was like indian martial art,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's what the guy did.</v>

2105
01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:19.500
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He sent you a black belt and then just </v>

2106
01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:19.500
<v Speaker 6>through the honor system in to watch the</v>
<v Speaker 6>dvds.</v>

2107
01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:23.940
<v Speaker 6>That's so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that's just people trying to make </v>

2108
01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:25.711
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the one thing about martial arts </v>

2109
01:41:25.711 --> 01:41:25.711
<v Speaker 6>is a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can.</v>

2110
01:41:25.711 --> 01:41:28.840
<v Speaker 6>You can definitely learn some things </v>
<v Speaker 6>from a dvd as long as you get one on one</v>

2111
01:41:28.841 --> 01:41:29.780
<v Speaker 6>instruction as well.</v>

2112
01:41:29.780 --> 01:41:32.850
<v Speaker 6>Like the originally get one on one </v>
<v Speaker 6>instruction like it.</v>

2113
01:41:32.851 --> 01:41:36.160
<v Speaker 6>It's way quicker path.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you have someone showing you where to</v>

2114
01:41:36.161 --> 01:41:37.740
<v Speaker 6>put your weight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially jujitsu,</v>

2115
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:39.790
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to see what's going on.</v>

2116
01:41:39.791 --> 01:41:44.791
<v Speaker 6>like if you're watching the guys strike </v>
<v Speaker 6>like you're seeing things in real life </v>

2117
01:41:44.791 --> 01:41:46.480
<v Speaker 6>like you're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas his chin is his placement.</v>

2118
01:41:46.481 --> 01:41:51.481
<v Speaker 6>It seems like there's less variables,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but when you're seeing jujitsu like you </v>

2119
01:41:51.481 --> 01:41:55.420
<v Speaker 6>don't know understand like where he's </v>
<v Speaker 6>his holding his balance and and how he,</v>

2120
01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:59.260
<v Speaker 6>how he passes the garden a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's so many different things that go</v>

2121
01:41:59.261 --> 01:42:04.261
<v Speaker 6>along with like setting up a submission </v>
<v Speaker 6>has all these steps along the way that </v>

2122
01:42:04.261 --> 01:42:08.071
<v Speaker 6>are super critical because you've got to</v>
<v Speaker 6>know the defense of those steps and you </v>

2123
01:42:08.071 --> 01:42:11.161
<v Speaker 6>got to know the counter to that defense </v>
<v Speaker 6>and you've got to have two different </v>

2124
01:42:11.161 --> 01:42:11.161
<v Speaker 6>paths out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't just have one.</v>

2125
01:42:11.161 --> 01:42:14.890
<v Speaker 6>So like while you're teaching someone </v>
<v Speaker 6>like a jujitsu,</v>

2126
01:42:14.891 --> 01:42:17.980
<v Speaker 6>like a setup for a submission,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're also teaching them the defense of</v>

2127
01:42:17.981 --> 01:42:22.981
<v Speaker 6>that submission and you're also teaching</v>
<v Speaker 6>them like usually you're teaching them </v>

2128
01:42:22.981 --> 01:42:24.060
<v Speaker 6>what the counter is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2129
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:25.820
<v Speaker 6>especially if they're like bluebell,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bluebell,</v>

2130
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:26.740
<v Speaker 6>leverage,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>

2131
01:42:27.190 --> 01:42:29.920
<v Speaker 6>So there's just so many lIke to teach </v>
<v Speaker 6>that with a dvd,</v>

2132
01:42:29.921 --> 01:42:34.921
<v Speaker 6>it's so hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can kind of teach basics like real </v>

2133
01:42:34.921 --> 01:42:35.680
<v Speaker 6>simple stuff and if you paid really </v>
<v Speaker 6>close attention,</v>

2134
01:42:35.681 --> 01:42:37.930
<v Speaker 6>you can kind of learn that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but way harder.</v>

2135
01:42:38.050 --> 01:42:40.900
<v Speaker 6>it's way better to have somebody move </v>
<v Speaker 6>you like show you like here,</v>

2136
01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:42.850
<v Speaker 6>like not turn it like there and you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2137
01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:47.900
<v Speaker 6>ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because it was like some like subtle </v>

2138
01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:47.900
<v Speaker 6>variations just in the way you hold a </v>
<v Speaker 6>choke,</v>

2139
01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:49.540
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because this guy who one in Brazil,</v>

2140
01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:51.520
<v Speaker 6>one of the last,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2141
01:42:51.610 --> 01:42:52.480
<v Speaker 6>cars that we did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2142
01:42:52.481 --> 01:42:52.800
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

2143
01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:57.820
<v Speaker 6>Mexico city.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He caught this dude in a good team and </v>

2144
01:42:57.820 --> 01:42:58.360
<v Speaker 6>he did this new thing that a lot of guys</v>
<v Speaker 6>are doing called the pretzel grip.</v>

2145
01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:03.560
<v Speaker 6>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if someone doesn't show you how to do </v>

2146
01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:03.560
<v Speaker 6>that grip,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it seems.</v>

2147
01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:04.060
<v Speaker 6>It seems real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cavan mimic you doing that.</v>

2148
01:43:04.061 --> 01:43:06.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My friend was watching you on video.</v>

2149
01:43:06.220 --> 01:43:09.640
<v Speaker 6>My friend denny showed it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it seems goofy as hell,</v>

2150
01:43:09.641 --> 01:43:11.800
<v Speaker 6>but when you actually do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it really works.</v>

2151
01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:16.920
<v Speaker 6>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like this crazy new grip that guys </v>

2152
01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:19.371
<v Speaker 6>are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's one of those things like </v>

2153
01:43:19.371 --> 01:43:19.371
<v Speaker 6>someone's gotta like put your hands </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

2154
01:43:19.371 --> 01:43:19.930
<v Speaker 6>You got to show it to you.</v>

<v Speaker 4>so I don't want to even research it.</v>

2173
01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:13.060
<v Speaker 4>Find out if it's not real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is all these different photos </v>

<v Speaker 4>We're hugging and they're all sitting </v>

2205
01:45:45.330 --> 01:45:46.640
<v Speaker 4>around just chilling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem real.</v>

2206
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.940
<v Speaker 4>Teenagers might not be posed like it's </v>

<v Speaker 4>look at us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

2208
01:45:51.380 --> 01:45:52.340
<v Speaker 4>but it might be real.</v>

2209
01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:57.910
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're dealing with someone that's </v>

2210
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:59.870
<v Speaker 4>going to do a ritual suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the kind of willpower and then they</v>

2211
01:45:59.871 --> 01:46:04.871
<v Speaker 4>had to be as gangster as possible when </v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy is stabbing himself in the </v>

2212
01:46:05.691 --> 01:46:10.400
<v Speaker 4>stomach and cutting his guts open with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>sword,</v>

2213
01:46:10.730 --> 01:46:15.730
<v Speaker 4>it's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That can be a real picture because it's </v>

2214
01:46:15.730 --> 01:46:16.210
<v Speaker 4>probably colorized whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>colored eggs,</v>

2215
01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:16.600
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2216
01:46:16.790 --> 01:46:17.890
<v Speaker 4>Add this little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2217
01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:20.160
<v Speaker 4>Well I think that the whole photos got </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be colorized,</v>

2218
01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:24.140
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't have photos back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is all colorized.</v>

2219
01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:24.880
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2220
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:28.300
<v Speaker 4>the photos that are black and white.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of prefer a test.</v>

2221
01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:31.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A shirley temple fakeness.</v>

2222
01:46:31.130 --> 01:46:32.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to see that,</v>

2223
01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:37.680
<v Speaker 4>that fake color.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather see a black and white and </v>

2224
01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:40.310
<v Speaker 4>know that that's what it looked like to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the person that was holding that camera,</v>

2225
01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:42.980
<v Speaker 4>that made that photograph and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>developed it.</v>

2226
01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:49.060
<v Speaker 4>It's really amazing when you think about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that everything past like the </v>

2227
01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:49.650
<v Speaker 4>18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever it was,</v>

2228
01:46:49.651 --> 01:46:50.280
<v Speaker 4>when they invented</v>

2229
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:53.190
<v Speaker 6>cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything past that is accelerated.</v>

2230
01:46:53.191 --> 01:46:56.150
<v Speaker 6>Like our visual understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>world is accelerated in a,</v>

2231
01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:59.100
<v Speaker 6>in a way that we don't really think </v>
<v Speaker 6>about that much.</v>

2232
01:46:59.101 --> 01:47:02.190
<v Speaker 6>Like no one knew what the fuck africa </v>
<v Speaker 6>looked like back then.</v>

2233
01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:06.300
<v Speaker 6>Like if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you were living in Wyoming in 18,</v>

2234

<v Speaker 6>animals that were over in africa.</v>

2238
01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:18.360
<v Speaker 6>They might as well be talking about like</v>
<v Speaker 6>people that live on the moon,</v>

2239
01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:23.880

<v Speaker 6>20th century.</v>

2243
01:47:28.891 --> 01:47:29.730
<v Speaker 6>The 19 hundreds.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Those explorer dudes from the early 19 </v>
<v Speaker 6>hundreds,</v>

2270
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:54.190
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that would show up and you know,</v>

2271
01:48:54.210 --> 01:48:57.900
<v Speaker 6>they have like fucking their wives would</v>
<v Speaker 6>be with them and they tried to like make</v>

2272
01:48:57.901 --> 01:48:59.740
<v Speaker 6>camps in the Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2273
01:48:59.850 --> 01:49:02.790
<v Speaker 6>like that was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was the subject of so many movies.</v>

2274
01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:06.330
<v Speaker 6>Like that was the subject of king kong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember this is an explorer.</v>

2275
01:49:06.750 --> 01:49:11.750
<v Speaker 6>They brought the actress and they showed</v>
<v Speaker 6>up with his island like and these like </v>

2276
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:12.900
<v Speaker 6>the ghost in the darkness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember that.</v>

2277
01:49:13.170 --> 01:49:18.170
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the white people and all the black </v>

2278
01:49:18.170 --> 01:49:20.121
<v Speaker 6>people working for them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're making a railroad and africa </v>

2279
01:49:20.121 --> 01:49:21.870
<v Speaker 6>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2280
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:24.350
<v Speaker 6>This is a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have his,</v>

2281
01:49:24.351 --> 01:49:25.680
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is pretty cool,</v>

2282
01:49:25.681 --> 01:49:26.010
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2283
01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:30.240
<v Speaker 6>They have is actual account of like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

2284
01:49:30.241 --> 01:49:33.110
<v Speaker 6>of meeting a girl for the first time </v>
<v Speaker 6>from our campsite,</v>

2285
01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:38.120
<v Speaker 6>we were able to watch a herd of big </v>
<v Speaker 6>black monkeys which tried to climb the </v>

2286
01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:42.801
<v Speaker 6>crest of the volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We succeeded in killing two of these </v>

2287
01:49:42.801 --> 01:49:45.300
<v Speaker 6>animals and with a rumbling noise,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they tumbled into a ravine which had its</v>

2288
01:49:45.301 --> 01:49:49.900
<v Speaker 6>opening and a north easterly direction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>After five hours of strenuous work,</v>

2289
01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:52.930
<v Speaker 6>we succeeded in retrieving one of these </v>
<v Speaker 6>animals using a rope.</v>

2290
01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:58.500
<v Speaker 6>It was a big human like male monkey of </v>
<v Speaker 6>one and a half meters in height and a </v>

2291
01:49:58.500 --> 01:50:03.421
<v Speaker 6>weight of over 200 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His chest had no hair and his hands and </v>

2292
01:50:03.421 --> 01:50:05.350
<v Speaker 6>feet were of enormous size.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Unfortunately,</v>

2293
01:50:05.351 --> 01:50:08.620
<v Speaker 6>I was unable to determine its type </v>
<v Speaker 6>because of its size.</v>

2294
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:12.970
<v Speaker 6>It could not very well be a chimpanzee </v>
<v Speaker 6>or a gorilla.</v>

2295
01:50:12.971 --> 01:50:16.630
<v Speaker 6>So they did know some gorillas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In any case,</v>

2296
01:50:16.631 --> 01:50:21.631
<v Speaker 6>the presence of gorilla had not been </v>
<v Speaker 6>established in the area around the </v>

2297
01:50:21.631 --> 01:50:22.990
<v Speaker 6>lakes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they didn't know what it was.</v>

2298
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:25.870
<v Speaker 6>This is so confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at the photo brion pull.</v>

2299
01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:28.120
<v Speaker 6>Pull that up because it's a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 6>picture of this.</v>

2300
01:50:28.390 --> 01:50:30.910
<v Speaker 6>These people standing over this dead </v>
<v Speaker 6>gorilla.</v>

2301
01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:34.540
<v Speaker 6>This is one of the first gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's a mountain gorilla.</v>

2302
01:50:34.570 --> 01:50:36.100
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he said gorilla.</v>

2303
01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:38.800
<v Speaker 6>So that's kinda weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what does that mean?</v>

2304
01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:41.710
<v Speaker 6>Like when did they discover the actual </v>
<v Speaker 6>gorilla?</v>

2305
01:50:41.770 --> 01:50:44.010
<v Speaker 6>So there's other kinds of gorillas other</v>
<v Speaker 6>than mountain gorillas.</v>

2306
01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:45.910
<v Speaker 6>Then that's the only thing that makes </v>
<v Speaker 6>sense to me,</v>

2307
01:50:46.930 --> 01:50:51.400
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>A physical characteristics,</v>

2308
01:50:51.401 --> 01:50:53.010
<v Speaker 6>discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 6>communications,</v>

2309
01:50:53.011 --> 01:50:54.910
<v Speaker 6>intelligence tool use interaction with </v>
<v Speaker 6>humans.</v>

2310
01:50:54.911 --> 01:50:55.300
<v Speaker 6>Here we go.</v>

2311
01:50:57.520 --> 01:51:02.520
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Five hundred bc and implore explorer on </v>

2312
01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:06.310
<v Speaker 6>an expedition in the west african coast </v>
<v Speaker 6>encountered a savage people,</v>

2313
01:51:06.311 --> 01:51:11.311
<v Speaker 6>the greater part of whom were women </v>
<v Speaker 6>whose bodies were harry and who are </v>

2314
01:51:11.311 --> 01:51:11.920
<v Speaker 6>interpreters,</v>
<v Speaker 6>called gorilla.</v>

2315
01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:15.340
<v Speaker 6>The word was then later used as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>species name.</v>

2316
01:51:15.341 --> 01:51:20.341
<v Speaker 6>And although it's unknown whether these </v>
<v Speaker 6>ancient carthy gains encountered were </v>

2317
01:51:20.741 --> 01:51:25.741
<v Speaker 6>truly gorillas,</v>
<v Speaker 6>another species of apes or monkeys or </v>

2318
01:51:25.741 --> 01:51:25.741
<v Speaker 6>even humans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2319
01:51:25.741 --> 01:51:30.330
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that was the first account of </v>

2320
01:51:30.330 --> 01:51:30.330
<v Speaker 6>gorillas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's written down.</v>

2321
01:51:30.330 --> 01:51:33.960
<v Speaker 6>That was 500 years before christ.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the first westerner to see a live </v>

2322
01:51:34.541 --> 01:51:39.541
<v Speaker 6>gorilla was in 1856.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He brought dead specimens to the uk in </v>

2323
01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:42.160
<v Speaker 6>18,</v>
<v Speaker 6>61.</v>

2324
01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:47.920
<v Speaker 6>The first systematic study was not </v>
<v Speaker 6>conducted until the 19 twenties.</v>

2325
01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:53.070
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean they kind of knew about gorillas </v>

2326
01:51:53.070 --> 01:51:53.070
<v Speaker 6>back then that it seems like it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at that thing.</v>

2327
01:51:53.070 --> 01:51:55.090
<v Speaker 6>Isn't that weird?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fake god,</v>

2328
01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:56.500
<v Speaker 6>that face looks fake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2329
01:51:56.501 --> 01:51:58.810
<v Speaker 6>But they couldn't do fake back then to </v>
<v Speaker 6>fake that.</v>

2330
01:51:58.811 --> 01:52:00.280
<v Speaker 6>They had actually looks pretty real </v>
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

2331
01:52:00.281 --> 01:52:02.980
<v Speaker 6>if you will look at that face that face,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like get close up on it.</v>

2332
01:52:03.070 --> 01:52:06.280
<v Speaker 6>Like that thing that's a dead monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But those mountain gorillas,</v>

2333
01:52:06.281 --> 01:52:07.900
<v Speaker 6>they have those chest plates,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2334
01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:14.160
<v Speaker 6>plus you gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you gotta realize that's like the worst </v>

2335
01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:16.681
<v Speaker 6>cell phone picture ever know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what like the best pictures were </v>

2336
01:52:16.681 --> 01:52:17.980
<v Speaker 6>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The best pictures.</v>

2337
01:52:17.981 --> 01:52:19.270
<v Speaker 6>I mean this is 18,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

2338
01:52:19.271 --> 01:52:20.440
<v Speaker 6>It was at 18,</v>
<v Speaker 6>60.</v>

2339
01:52:20.441 --> 01:52:21.250
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2340
01:52:21.251 --> 01:52:24.440
<v Speaker 6>the dude had to set up that thing that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they didn't have flashback.</v>

2341
01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:27.300
<v Speaker 6>Now he's in 19,</v>
<v Speaker 6>19.</v>

2342
01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:27.980
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two nine.</v>

2343
01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:28.960
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the 19.</v>

2344
01:52:28.961 --> 01:52:29.620
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>two picture.</v>

2345
01:52:30.250 --> 01:52:32.260
<v Speaker 6>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2346
01:52:32.261 --> 01:52:37.261
<v Speaker 6>so that's the mountain gorilla.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I guess like they had some different </v>

2347
01:52:37.261 --> 01:52:39.850
<v Speaker 6>species of gorillas,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it wasn't really until the 1800 that</v>

2348
01:52:40.210 --> 01:52:42.490
<v Speaker 6>us white people started figuring out </v>
<v Speaker 6>that they were even real.</v>

2349
01:52:43.050 --> 01:52:46.130
<v Speaker 6>I think the first thing he does when he </v>
<v Speaker 6>sees him as he tries to kill him,</v>

2350
01:52:46.670 --> 01:52:49.190
<v Speaker 6>I know felt like the first like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2351
01:52:49.191 --> 01:52:50.400
<v Speaker 6>what's this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I kill it.</v>

2352
01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:51.860
<v Speaker 6>Don't you think that's what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If,</v>

2353
01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:55.130
<v Speaker 6>if aliens landed here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do think we shoot first.</v>

2354
01:52:55.131 --> 01:52:55.820
<v Speaker 6>They'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

2355
01:52:55.821 --> 01:53:00.821
<v Speaker 6>that's just what they.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are there certain people that would </v>

2356
01:53:00.821 --> 01:53:00.821
<v Speaker 6>definitely shoot for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2357
01:53:00.821 --> 01:53:00.920
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's people out there,</v>

2358
01:53:00.921 --> 01:53:05.921
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it goes back to what we're saying </v>

2359
01:53:05.921 --> 01:53:05.921
<v Speaker 6>about cops.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's some cops,</v>

2360
01:53:05.921 --> 01:53:07.120
<v Speaker 6>they're just getting out of the car </v>
<v Speaker 6>shooting right there.</v>

2361
01:53:07.130 --> 01:53:08.300
<v Speaker 6>They're looking to shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2362
01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:13.840
<v Speaker 6>And I think there's probably like some </v>
<v Speaker 6>human beings that have aliens showed up,</v>

2363
01:53:13.911 --> 01:53:14.690
<v Speaker 6>would do the same thing.</v>

2364
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:16.670
<v Speaker 6>They would see the alien and they just </v>
<v Speaker 6>start shooting.</v>

2365
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:21.910
<v Speaker 6>They wouldn't even think about if they </v>
<v Speaker 6>had a gun on them and they were worried </v>

2366
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.910
<v Speaker 6>about their life off the alien.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Went like put,</v>

2367
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:24.840
<v Speaker 6>put his hand out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2368
01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:29.880
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd weird out if it was trying to </v>

2369
01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:29.880
<v Speaker 6>communicate with you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the,</v>

2370
01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:33.450
<v Speaker 6>you would have to be so vulnerable to </v>
<v Speaker 6>like allow an alien close enough to you </v>

2371
01:53:33.450 --> 01:53:35.090
<v Speaker 6>to communicate with it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to assume that it's not going</v>

2372
01:53:35.091 --> 01:53:36.440
<v Speaker 6>to eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2373
01:53:36.441 --> 01:53:37.990
<v Speaker 6>how would you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2374
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.760
<v Speaker 6>could you imagine how stupid you would </v>
<v Speaker 6>feel if you came up to an alien?</v>

2375
01:53:40.761 --> 01:53:41.690
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hello friend.</v>

2376
01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:45.210
<v Speaker 6>And it's like throws a net on your </v>
<v Speaker 6>cinches it uptight,</v>

2377
01:53:45.570 --> 01:53:49.210
<v Speaker 6>holds you up and take some selfies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2378
01:53:49.410 --> 01:53:51.360
<v Speaker 6>Fucking throws you in the back of its </v>
<v Speaker 6>spaceship.</v>

2379
01:53:51.361 --> 01:53:52.460
<v Speaker 6>And you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

2380
01:53:52.461 --> 01:53:54.110
<v Speaker 6>I should have shot him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2381
01:53:54.111 --> 01:53:56.150
<v Speaker 6>So who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they're like us,</v>

2382
01:53:56.330 --> 01:53:57.520
<v Speaker 6>maybe we should fucking shoot them.</v>

2383
01:53:59.650 --> 01:54:03.350
<v Speaker 6>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Or maybe that brain thing where you can.</v>

2384
01:54:03.380 --> 01:54:04.730
<v Speaker 6>Your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Good thing.</v>

2385
01:54:04.731 --> 01:54:08.220
<v Speaker 6>Maybe that's the piece of eQuipment we </v>
<v Speaker 6>need to actually talk to them.</v>

2386
01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:12.260
<v Speaker 6>Did you see a europa report is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 6>interesting.</v>

2387
01:54:12.590 --> 01:54:13.840
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's um,</v>

2388
01:54:14.270 --> 01:54:19.270
<v Speaker 6>it's a movie about these people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a scifi movie about theSe people </v>

2389
01:54:19.270 --> 01:54:23.801
<v Speaker 6>that go to europa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Europa is one of jupiter's moons And it </v>

2390
01:54:23.801 --> 01:54:26.900
<v Speaker 6>apparently has water on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's jupiter's moon,</v>

2391
01:54:27.130 --> 01:54:28.280
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So julie's mom.</v>

2392
01:54:29.150 --> 01:54:32.300
<v Speaker 6>apparently it's frozen solid.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a ball of ice.</v>

2393
01:54:32.540 --> 01:54:35.750
<v Speaker 6>And under the surface there's cracks on </v>
<v Speaker 6>the surface.</v>

2394
01:54:35.751 --> 01:54:38.330
<v Speaker 6>It indicate there's some sort of flowing</v>
<v Speaker 6>water underneath.</v>

2395
01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:41.060
<v Speaker 6>And so they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're trying to,</v>

2396
01:54:41.061 --> 01:54:42.740
<v Speaker 6>in this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they go there.</v>

2397
01:54:42.741 --> 01:54:47.741
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to spoiler alert for </v>
<v Speaker 6>anybody but they go there and have </v>

2398
01:54:47.741 --> 01:54:48.290
<v Speaker 6>encounters.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But the way,</v>

2399
01:54:48.380 --> 01:54:49.550
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2400
01:54:49.670 --> 01:54:51.800
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you think about like someone coming from</v>

2401
01:54:51.801 --> 01:54:53.600
<v Speaker 6>another planet and landing on your </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking planet,</v>

2402
01:54:53.810 --> 01:54:56.960
<v Speaker 6>you're going to automatically assume </v>
<v Speaker 6>they're hostile is fuck yeah.</v>

2403
01:54:57.020 --> 01:54:59.290
<v Speaker 6>Like you're going to automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2404
01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:01.550
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Aliens are dead.</v>

2405
01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:07.120
<v Speaker 6>They're dead or were dead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That word that one of the other figure </v>

2406
01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:07.730
<v Speaker 6>there knows,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe they dIdn't.</v>

2407
01:55:08.090 --> 01:55:11.300
<v Speaker 6>Maybe they have really low testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe they breed.</v>

2408
01:55:11.390 --> 01:55:16.390
<v Speaker 6>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if aliens evolve to breed with no </v>

2409
01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:19.541
<v Speaker 6>sex?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there's no competition for breeding </v>

2410
01:55:19.541 --> 01:55:21.310
<v Speaker 6>and the competition is all about </v>
<v Speaker 6>surviving against their elements and the</v>

2411
01:55:21.620 --> 01:55:23.600
<v Speaker 6>predators and their area.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they don't have,</v>

2412
01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:26.720
<v Speaker 6>they don't have like this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this male conquer thing like we do.</v>

2413
01:55:26.721 --> 01:55:29.890
<v Speaker 6>they're all androgynous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why they don't have decks.</v>

2414
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:31.880
<v Speaker 6>They don't have a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't have big titties.</v>

2415
01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:35.840
<v Speaker 6>No aliens don't have beauty videos.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no twerking in the alien world.</v>

2416
01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:37.850
<v Speaker 6>They don't care about sex.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't mean anything.</v>

2417
01:55:37.970 --> 01:55:41.870
<v Speaker 6>The number one thing to us is sex.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like we need.</v>

2418
01:55:41.871 --> 01:55:46.871
<v Speaker 6>We have this crazy desire to procreate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have this crazy desire to be with </v>

2419
01:55:46.871 --> 01:55:48.600
<v Speaker 6>other people of the opposite or in some </v>
<v Speaker 6>cases the same sex.</v>

2420
01:55:49.050 --> 01:55:52.110
<v Speaker 6>It's a big factor for why people become </v>
<v Speaker 6>successful.</v>

2421
01:55:52.290 --> 01:55:57.290
<v Speaker 6>It's a big factor for why people sell </v>
<v Speaker 6>items that use beautiful women to sell </v>

2422
01:55:57.290 --> 01:56:01.461
<v Speaker 6>things and dudes with fucking six packs </v>
<v Speaker 6>of cell genes and jimmy dean sausage </v>

2423
01:56:01.531 --> 01:56:02.760
<v Speaker 6>isn't shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2424
01:56:03.810 --> 01:56:06.210
<v Speaker 6>that's just a reality of being a human </v>
<v Speaker 6>being.</v>

2425
01:56:06.211 --> 01:56:11.211
<v Speaker 6>So it's really hard for us to separate </v>
<v Speaker 6>that idea from living organisms.</v>

2426
01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:14.880
<v Speaker 6>But like there's a lot of organisms that</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't have sex at all.</v>

2427
01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:16.970
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's plants and some,</v>

2428
01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:20.310
<v Speaker 6>some fucking slugs and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess they fucked,</v>

2429
01:56:20.311 --> 01:56:22.200
<v Speaker 6>but there they are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the male and the female.</v>

2430
01:56:22.201 --> 01:56:23.170
<v Speaker 6>The male could fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

2431
01:56:23.310 --> 01:56:28.310
<v Speaker 6>they're both like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think a slug is like one of those </v>

2432
01:56:28.310 --> 01:56:28.380
<v Speaker 6>things is by its bisexual in a weird </v>
<v Speaker 6>way,</v>

2433
01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:33.480
<v Speaker 6>not like you're in the chicks,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the way you have both sexes.</v>

2434
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:35.360
<v Speaker 6>They're hermaphrodites.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got it.</v>

2435
01:56:35.361 --> 01:56:37.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I mean we could have.</v>

2436
01:56:37.650 --> 01:56:42.650
<v Speaker 6>that could easily be the case with some </v>
<v Speaker 6>being from another planet and if that's </v>

2437
01:56:42.650 --> 01:56:43.980
<v Speaker 6>the case,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they might not understand aggression.</v>

2438
01:56:44.370 --> 01:56:47.790
<v Speaker 6>They might not understand how locked out</v>
<v Speaker 6>we are and then they just show up.</v>

2439
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.400
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if the aliens land and they show up</v>

2440
01:56:50.430 --> 01:56:54.780
<v Speaker 6>very hippyish were just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they might not understand violence.</v>

2441
01:56:54.930 --> 01:56:59.930
<v Speaker 6>They might have somehow another grown up</v>
<v Speaker 6>in this goldilocks zone that's like way </v>

2442
01:56:59.930 --> 01:57:01.890
<v Speaker 6>better than our goldilocks zone where </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no predators.</v>

2443
01:57:02.070 --> 01:57:07.070
<v Speaker 6>Everyone eats plants.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All procreation is all procreation is </v>

2444
01:57:08.701 --> 01:57:13.701
<v Speaker 6>done through like this mutual experience</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the entire tribe gets together and </v>

2445
01:57:13.701 --> 01:57:17.781
<v Speaker 6>has,</v>
<v Speaker 6>has babies together and that there's no </v>

2446
01:57:17.781 --> 01:57:17.781
<v Speaker 6>sex involved and it's all just </v>
<v Speaker 6>community,</v>

2447
01:57:17.781 --> 01:57:22.010
<v Speaker 6>friendship and love.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then a child is born out of that </v>

2448
01:57:22.010 --> 01:57:22.010
<v Speaker 6>love.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's just as look.</v>

2449
01:57:22.010 --> 01:57:26.840
<v Speaker 6>How weird is it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You shoot a load in someone's pussy and </v>

2450
01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:26.840
<v Speaker 6>that's what makes a person that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking ridiculous.</v>

2451
01:57:27.410 --> 01:57:32.410
<v Speaker 6>IT's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not just as ridiculous to think of </v>

2452
01:57:32.410 --> 01:57:33.480
<v Speaker 6>a community of evolved beings and all </v>
<v Speaker 6>get together and hug,</v>

2453
01:57:33.710 --> 01:57:35.220
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then out of that hug,</v>

2454
01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:37.770
<v Speaker 6>a tiny child appears and they all care </v>
<v Speaker 6>for it together.</v>

2455
01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:39.950
<v Speaker 6>That's just as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then they get lost,</v>

2456
01:57:39.951 --> 01:57:43.620
<v Speaker 6>show up on earth and we waste them </v>
<v Speaker 6>within 15 minutes.</v>

2457
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:44.910
<v Speaker 6>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Craziest pollen.</v>

2458
01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:50.120
<v Speaker 6>how crazy is the fact that plants need </v>
<v Speaker 6>bees to take pollen and pollinate their </v>

2459
01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:50.860
<v Speaker 6>fucking plants?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2460
01:57:50.990 --> 01:57:55.990
<v Speaker 6>polly take flowers and distribute like </v>
<v Speaker 6>literally genetic material from those </v>

2461
01:57:56.461 --> 01:57:59.760
<v Speaker 6>plants distributed all around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If that's a part of the whole ecosystem.</v>

2462
01:57:59.940 --> 01:58:04.940
<v Speaker 6>You have these bees that are responsible</v>
<v Speaker 6>for these plants growing and if these </v>

2463
01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:05.970
<v Speaker 6>bees die off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everybody's freaking out.</v>

2464
01:58:05.971 --> 01:58:08.610
<v Speaker 6>Like what kind of lose the bees were </v>
<v Speaker 6>gonna lose society.</v>

2465
01:58:08.611 --> 01:58:10.290
<v Speaker 6>People are going to starve.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what?</v>

2466
01:58:10.530 --> 01:58:12.660
<v Speaker 6>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>we got workers.</v>

2467
01:58:12.661 --> 01:58:15.420
<v Speaker 6>We got these little worker bees that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they work for us.</v>

2468
01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:18.440
<v Speaker 6>We don't even know about It.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like we need them to feel like they're.</v>

2469
01:58:18.730 --> 01:58:22.310
<v Speaker 6>They're important for almonds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what would be the other day,</v>

2470
01:58:22.380 --> 01:58:25.560
<v Speaker 6>I didn't feel mother fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you terrible person,</v>

2471
01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:28.920
<v Speaker 6>terrible person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but think about that.</v>

2472
01:58:28.921 --> 01:58:33.360
<v Speaker 6>That's an actual reality of nature is </v>
<v Speaker 6>that bees pollinate plants.</v>

2473
01:58:33.361 --> 01:58:35.520
<v Speaker 6>It's a reality of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so bizarre,</v>

2474
01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:38.970
<v Speaker 6>but it's responsible for like the </v>
<v Speaker 6>progression of plant life.</v>

2475
01:58:38.971 --> 01:58:40.890
<v Speaker 6>That's like a big part of how it goes </v>
<v Speaker 6>down.</v>

2476
01:58:41.470 --> 01:58:46.470
<v Speaker 6>Like I think there could be an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 6>number of different styles of life out </v>

2477
01:58:46.781 --> 01:58:51.781
<v Speaker 6>there in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's one of the things is europa </v>

2478
01:58:51.781 --> 01:58:51.781
<v Speaker 6>report thing was about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wasn't the best movie,</v>

2479
01:58:51.781 --> 01:58:54.670
<v Speaker 6>but it held my attention.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was interesting and it was about like</v>

2480
01:58:55.750 --> 01:59:00.750
<v Speaker 6>an alternative type of life that could </v>
<v Speaker 6>exist on a predictive aliens land.</v>

2481
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:06.030
<v Speaker 6>It probably began to be skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would think they would be so slick </v>

2482
01:59:06.030 --> 01:59:06.700
<v Speaker 6>that they would be right here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right now.</v>

2483
01:59:06.701 --> 01:59:07.510
<v Speaker 6>We'd have no idea.</v>

2484
01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:14.550
<v Speaker 6>I think they're hiding in the asians.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's so many asians in China and </v>

2485
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:15.640
<v Speaker 6>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of places to hide.</v>

2486
01:59:15.730 --> 01:59:20.730
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's because they had a landmass over </v>

2487
01:59:20.730 --> 01:59:20.730
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

2488
01:59:20.730 --> 01:59:24.110
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that was one of my more stupid theories </v>

2489
01:59:24.110 --> 01:59:27.390
<v Speaker 6>when I was into the idea that human </v>
<v Speaker 6>beings are genetically engineered from </v>

2490
01:59:27.390 --> 01:59:30.871
<v Speaker 6>aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They took people and they added alien </v>

2491
01:59:30.871 --> 01:59:34.231
<v Speaker 6>dna to people and that's why we're so </v>
<v Speaker 6>different from all the other monkeys </v>

2492
01:59:34.231 --> 01:59:34.231
<v Speaker 6>that exists.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All the other apes.</v>

2493
01:59:34.231 --> 01:59:36.070
<v Speaker 6>My big thing was that like they had like</v>
<v Speaker 6>different,</v>

2494
01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:41.460
<v Speaker 6>different levels.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they'll put like a little less </v>

2495

<v Speaker 6>some people and there'd be like a little</v>

2496
01:59:41.921 --> 01:59:43.540
<v Speaker 6>less,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a little hairier like doing it.</v>

2497
01:59:43.550 --> 01:59:45.760
<v Speaker 6>A lot of back hair with the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2498
01:59:45.761 --> 01:59:48.430
<v Speaker 6>You ever go to the beach and see some.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some fucking dudes are just.</v>

2500
01:59:53.431 --> 01:59:54.190
<v Speaker 6>see an asian guy.</v>

2501
01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:55.870
<v Speaker 6>No hair at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2502
01:59:56.370 --> 01:59:59.050
<v Speaker 6>the different,</v>
<v Speaker 6>complete different features.</v>

2503
01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:00.010
<v Speaker 6>Smart,</v>
<v Speaker 6>very,</v>

2504
02:00:00.011 --> 02:00:03.070
<v Speaker 6>very little body hair.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Notoriously good at mathematics.</v>

2505
02:00:04.210 --> 02:00:06.430
<v Speaker 6>That was my stupid theory that they were</v>
<v Speaker 6>more alien.</v>

2506
02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:09.090
<v Speaker 6>So dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2507
02:00:09.140 --> 02:00:10.120
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm forward.</v>

2508
02:00:10.121 --> 02:00:12.520
<v Speaker 6>So you know who's for it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dennis mckenna.</v>

2509
02:00:12.630 --> 02:00:15.280
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dennis mckenna thinks it's very possible</v>

2510
02:00:15.281 --> 02:00:20.281
<v Speaker 6>that some sort of other advanced life </v>
<v Speaker 6>form has visited earth in the past and </v>

2511
02:00:20.441 --> 02:00:25.441
<v Speaker 6>subtly or actively re-engineered or </v>
<v Speaker 6>engineered human beings that they had </v>

2512
02:00:25.961 --> 02:00:30.961
<v Speaker 6>some hand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said it's possible and he bases that </v>

2513
02:00:30.961 --> 02:00:34.201
<v Speaker 6>on like a bunch of things like what we </v>
<v Speaker 6>would do if we could do it like if and </v>

2514
02:00:34.201 --> 02:00:39.141
<v Speaker 6>and the idea that we're a fairly young </v>
<v Speaker 6>planet lIke earth is only like four and </v>

2515
02:00:39.791 --> 02:00:44.791
<v Speaker 6>a half billion years old.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the universe was around for 10 </v>

2516
02:00:44.791 --> 02:00:47.260
<v Speaker 6>billion years before earth was or </v>
<v Speaker 6>somewhere abouts roughly.</v>

2517
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:51.220
<v Speaker 6>That's a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If something just had a 100,000</v>

2518
02:00:51.221 --> 02:00:52.660
<v Speaker 6>year headstart,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's it.</v>

2519
02:00:52.690 --> 02:00:54.520
<v Speaker 6>That's all it needs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>100,000</v>

2520
02:00:54.521 --> 02:00:57.190
<v Speaker 6>year head start from where we are now </v>
<v Speaker 6>without blowing yourself up.</v>

2521
02:00:57.220 --> 02:01:00.100
<v Speaker 6>Could you even imagine what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>freaky shit we're going to be able to do</v>

2522
02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:02.710
<v Speaker 6>and 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>years is a blink of an eye.</v>

2523
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:06.430
<v Speaker 6>So if we could show up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>see if the Congo was a planet instead of</v>

2524
02:01:06.431 --> 02:01:11.431
<v Speaker 6>like the Congo with these guys show up </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they start lighting these gorillas </v>

2525
02:01:11.431 --> 02:01:13.831
<v Speaker 6>up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What if there was a planet and we found </v>

2526
02:01:13.831 --> 02:01:16.861
<v Speaker 6>this planet and it was all apes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was no people and we did like an </v>

2527
02:01:16.861 --> 02:01:17.800
<v Speaker 6>accurate survey.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The planet like tom cruise style,</v>

2528
02:01:17.801 --> 02:01:20.680
<v Speaker 6>we land in this fucking little white </v>
<v Speaker 6>outfits.</v>

2529
02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:25.020
<v Speaker 6>We've taken like biological for a guy in</v>
<v Speaker 6>a hot chick,</v>

2530
02:01:25.100 --> 02:01:25.750
<v Speaker 6>hot chick,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2531
02:01:25.751 --> 02:01:27.070
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that he tries to keep me,</v>

2532
02:01:28.530 --> 02:01:31.030
<v Speaker 6>saved her life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She gets an injury.</v>

2533
02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:33.750
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's just a scout parties.</v>

2534
02:01:33.751 --> 02:01:35.230
<v Speaker 6>You've got to do your own scale party.</v>

2535
02:01:35.430 --> 02:01:36.240
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2536
02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:41.280
<v Speaker 6>maybe like you guys scale part of it </v>
<v Speaker 6>likes to tAke naps and he saw something </v>

2537
02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:42.380
<v Speaker 6>but you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you file for sure.</v>

2538
02:01:42.410 --> 02:01:43.930
<v Speaker 6>False reports,</v>
<v Speaker 6>travel.</v>

2539
02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:49.430
<v Speaker 6>And then there'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there'll be like a protagonist who's,</v>

2540
02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:54.460
<v Speaker 6>who's the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they would have to be a woman that's </v>

2541
02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:54.460
<v Speaker 6>like a powerful woman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like sort of balances it out.</v>

2542
02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:57.830
<v Speaker 6>Will you guys get that job done?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're down on planet Congo,</v>

2543
02:01:58.040 --> 02:02:03.040
<v Speaker 6>get the job done and get back up here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And maybe there's like cylons moving in </v>

2544
02:02:03.230 --> 02:02:05.180
<v Speaker 6>and we got to get back to the planet and</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking.</v>

2545
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:10.990
<v Speaker 6>But point being,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if we landed on planet Congo and there </v>

2546
02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:13.901
<v Speaker 6>was only monkeys,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if we thought that they were just like </v>

2547
02:02:13.901 --> 02:02:13.901
<v Speaker 6>the chimpanzees here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for sure,</v>

2548
02:02:13.901 --> 02:02:15.110
<v Speaker 6>we'd steal a few.</v>
<v Speaker 6>RiGht?</v>

2549
02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:17.210
<v Speaker 6>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are you kidding me?</v>

2550
02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:19.880
<v Speaker 6>If they knew that they could land on a </v>
<v Speaker 6>planet,</v>

2551
02:02:19.881 --> 02:02:22.130
<v Speaker 6>say if they found a planet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2552
02:02:22.340 --> 02:02:23.720
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a light year away,</v>

2553
02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:25.640
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they figured out how to get somewhere in</v>

2554
02:02:25.641 --> 02:02:30.641
<v Speaker 6>a year and on that plan that they knew </v>
<v Speaker 6>there was live primates that were </v>

2555
02:02:30.641 --> 02:02:30.740
<v Speaker 6>exactly like chimps.</v>

2556
02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:31.750
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2557
02:02:31.770 --> 02:02:32.810
<v Speaker 6>this is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2558
02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:38.200
<v Speaker 6>These animals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you Give them enough time at this </v>

2559
02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:38.200
<v Speaker 6>temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is what you get.</v>

2560
02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:39.290
<v Speaker 6>if the temperature's higher,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get dinosaurs.</v>

2561
02:02:39.410 --> 02:02:44.410
<v Speaker 6>If the temperature is lower,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get woolly mammoths and you know </v>

2562
02:02:44.410 --> 02:02:45.380
<v Speaker 6>what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what if it's like a universal thing</v>

2563
02:02:45.381 --> 02:02:46.050
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

2564
02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:49.910
<v Speaker 6>in the cosmos said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all you need is water and carbon and all</v>

2565
02:02:49.911 --> 02:02:52.580
<v Speaker 6>the building blocks and the same life </v>
<v Speaker 6>forms exist everywhere.</v>

2566
02:02:52.700 --> 02:02:57.700
<v Speaker 6>If we find that out and we show up </v>
<v Speaker 6>someplace and we find monkeys were </v>

2567
02:02:57.700 --> 02:02:58.580
<v Speaker 6>stealing them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2568
02:02:58.610 --> 02:03:00.320
<v Speaker 6>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we find that we go there,</v>

2569
02:03:00.321 --> 02:03:03.720
<v Speaker 6>there's parrots and anaconda is what </v>
<v Speaker 6>this is exactly like the rain forest,</v>

2570
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:04.970
<v Speaker 6>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly,</v>

2571
02:03:04.971 --> 02:03:09.971
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But pretty sure we'll fucking steal one </v>

2572
02:03:09.971 --> 02:03:09.971
<v Speaker 6>of those monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let's find out.</v>

2573
02:03:09.971 --> 02:03:13.780
<v Speaker 6>So there's the monkeys are the little </v>
<v Speaker 6>monkey community and monkey school </v>

2574
02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:15.260
<v Speaker 6>system and teaching each other what </v>
<v Speaker 6>sounds for anaconda.</v>

2575
02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:20.260
<v Speaker 6>What's the sound for,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for eagle that comes to steal you from </v>

2576
02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:22.961
<v Speaker 6>the trees.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They try to teach and we just go along </v>

2577
02:03:22.961 --> 02:03:22.961
<v Speaker 6>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2578
02:03:22.961 --> 02:03:23.390
<v Speaker 6>you're not smart enough for us to care </v>
<v Speaker 6>about your community.</v>

2579
02:03:23.490 --> 02:03:28.490
<v Speaker 6>And so getting the cage hooker clink,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shut that fucking box.</v>

2580
02:03:28.900 --> 02:03:30.150
<v Speaker 6>Push it into our space.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But.</v>

2581
02:03:31.530 --> 02:03:34.700
<v Speaker 6>And for the rest of their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those chimps have to freak out.</v>

2582
02:03:34.701 --> 02:03:37.190
<v Speaker 6>Thinking about the time that this thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>came,</v>

<v Speaker 6>this metal disk and stole their mommy.</v>

2585
02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:45.290
<v Speaker 6>We would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't you think of it in a second,</v>

2586
02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:48.080
<v Speaker 6>but in a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think we would do it?</v>

<v Speaker 6>we knew,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2627
02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:32.250
<v Speaker 2>unless she hits a picket fence and rips </v>
<v Speaker 2>it off.</v>

2628
02:05:32.430 --> 02:05:34.950

<v Speaker 2>of her that you would match up and go,</v>

2633
02:05:44.191 --> 02:05:46.410

<v Speaker 2>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I'm like,</v>

2648

<v Speaker 2>So then I even posted it on my fan page </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's some cops in,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2653
02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:39.240

<v Speaker 2>little bit of recourse.</v>

2654
02:06:40.020 --> 02:06:41.970
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2655
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:44.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm uh,</v>

2658
02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.310

<v Speaker 2>It's too bad you committed suicide over </v>

2661
02:06:59.661 --> 02:07:00.030
<v Speaker 2>the last doc.</v>

2662
02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:02.790

<v Speaker 2>You go stop being.</v>

2664
02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:11.060

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2666
02:07:15.151 --> 02:07:18.330
<v Speaker 2>So then my wife calls this woman and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this woman says,</v>

2667
02:07:18.331 --> 02:07:20.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched the dog for two days now,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It wasn't happy about this.</v>

2672
02:07:28.391 --> 02:07:30.120
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>enough to watch the dog for.</v>

2675
02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:43.740
<v Speaker 2>So my wife now keep in mind,</v>

2677
02:07:45.250 --> 02:07:46.690
<v Speaker 2>La time.</v>

02:07:46.930 --> 02:07:49.390
<v Speaker 2>don't drive to some random person's </v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy.</v>

2680
02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:52.870
<v Speaker 2>So she does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

02:07:53.080 --> 02:07:57.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm drives an hour and a half away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So kate,</v>

2682
02:07:57.190 --> 02:08:01.210
<v Speaker 2>from where your podcast is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>a doG park that's pretty close to here,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would anybody be hanging out at the dog </v>

2684
02:08:06.260 --> 02:08:08.380

<v Speaker 2>and a half.</v>

2685
02:08:08.381 --> 02:08:11.650
<v Speaker 2>You don't do that in los angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nothing's making sense.</v>

2686
02:08:12.070 --> 02:08:15.070
<v Speaker 2>So then she drives to this person's </v>

<v Speaker 2>The woman grabs a hold of margaret's </v>
<v Speaker 2>collar and then my wife has the collar </v>

2694
02:08:42.340 --> 02:08:45.490
<v Speaker 2>and then my wife's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that window because there's now there's </v>

2699
02:09:03.221 --> 02:09:07.600

<v Speaker 2>wife has 150 bucks cash.</v>

<v Speaker 2>backyard.</v>

2721
02:10:04.721 --> 02:10:07.870
<v Speaker 2>So it's pretty dog friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You as a dog,</v>

2722
02:10:07.871 --> 02:10:11.300
<v Speaker 2>you can't scale the wall or get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So someone had to get in.</v>

2723
02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:14.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't have anY proof of any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something happened.</v>

2724
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:19.470
<v Speaker 2>So you don't know if this lady is sold </v>
<v Speaker 2>or this got sold that lady that dog or </v>

2725
02:10:19.470 --> 02:10:21.490
<v Speaker 2>gave that lady that dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he gave it to her,</v>

2726
02:10:21.550 --> 02:10:24.100
<v Speaker 2>but I think a or anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they were running a,</v>

2727
02:10:24.110 --> 02:10:26.470
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have your dog give me money.</v>

2728
02:10:26.471 --> 02:10:31.471
<v Speaker 2>Some money scam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though that seems like a lot of </v>

2729
02:10:31.471 --> 02:10:31.471
<v Speaker 2>don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would they do that?</v>

2730
02:10:31.471 --> 02:10:35.341
<v Speaker 2>Because you contacted them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'Re just hoping that you would find </v>

2731
02:10:35.341 --> 02:10:35.341
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>YeAh.</v>

2732
02:10:35.341 --> 02:10:36.470
<v Speaker 2>So come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a ridiculous scam.</v>

2733
02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:39.020
<v Speaker 2>They would maybe contact you and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2734
02:10:39.021 --> 02:10:44.021
<v Speaker 2>I have your dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anybody's going to run a scam like </v>

2735
02:10:44.021 --> 02:10:46.361
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to put it in </v>

2736
02:10:46.361 --> 02:10:46.361
<v Speaker 2>craigslist or wherever you found it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2737
02:10:46.361 --> 02:10:46.361
<v Speaker 2>so we found it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2738
02:10:46.361 --> 02:10:50.460
<v Speaker 2>I gained craigslist like random.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just type the city I live in and </v>

2739
02:10:50.460 --> 02:10:51.710
<v Speaker 2>shepherd and a picture of her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she showed up.</v>

2740
02:10:51.740 --> 02:10:53.480
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2741
02:10:53.630 --> 02:10:56.450
<v Speaker 2>Or like I can't figure out like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

2742
02:10:56.451 --> 02:11:01.451
<v Speaker 2>Like none of like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's somebody who's just trying to </v>

2743
02:11:01.451 --> 02:11:04.690
<v Speaker 2>steal dogs and sell the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the really shitty at it because there's </v>

2744
02:11:04.690 --> 02:11:04.690
<v Speaker 2>a way easier way to do it.</v>

2745
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:10.350
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's all about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The movie lost and found with david </v>

2746
02:11:10.350 --> 02:11:10.920
<v Speaker 3>spade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seven,</v>

2747
02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:15.960
<v Speaker 3>seven psychopaths.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what the dude in seven </v>

2748
02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:15.960
<v Speaker 3>psychopaths did with the dog.</v>

2749
02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it could be like,</v>

2750
02:11:16.771 --> 02:11:18.040
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat that.</v>

2751
02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I have people around me that sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>will call and say,</v>

2752
02:11:22.381 --> 02:11:23.910
<v Speaker 2>your dogs are barking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

2753
02:11:23.950 --> 02:11:28.260
<v Speaker 2>This was a while ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a problem and then this person</v>

2754
02:11:28.261 --> 02:11:33.261
<v Speaker 2>would throw oranges from his side over </v>
<v Speaker 2>into my yard or like eggs and stuff like</v>

2755
02:11:33.811 --> 02:11:35.370
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Then he would call and say,</v>

2756
02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:38.400
<v Speaker 2>your dogs are back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're constantly barking.</v>

2757
02:11:38.401 --> 02:11:39.690
<v Speaker 2>And that would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah dude,</v>

2758
02:11:39.691 --> 02:11:44.691
<v Speaker 2>because you're throwing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're throwing shit at them and you're </v>

2759
02:11:44.691 --> 02:11:47.721
<v Speaker 2>having conversations with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course they're going to bark at </v>

2760
02:11:47.721 --> 02:11:50.790
<v Speaker 2>somebody on the other side of the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who knows if like a neighbor,</v>

2761
02:11:51.150 --> 02:11:53.250
<v Speaker 2>like had somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2762
02:11:53.810 --> 02:11:55.200
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my ex girlfriend,</v>

2763
02:11:55.260 --> 02:12:00.260
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My ex girlfriend had a dog and I think </v>

2764
02:12:00.260 --> 02:12:02.550
<v Speaker 3>because it barked all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think somebody poisoned it by throwing</v>

2765
02:12:02.551 --> 02:12:07.551
<v Speaker 3>a piece of food over the side of her </v>
<v Speaker 3>fence and then the dog died or it would</v>

2766
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:10.070
<v Speaker 2>tell me what you think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of tHat.</v>

2767
02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:12.320
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so my dog,</v>

2768
02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:17.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would always put like if I was making </v>

<v Speaker 2>peanut butter sandwich or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get like a scoop of peanut butter and </v>

<v Speaker 2>She won't even come by me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So right.</v>

2778
02:12:39.801 --> 02:12:42.680

<v Speaker 2>They're very quick.</v>

2783
02:12:49.630 --> 02:12:50.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

2784
02:12:50.630 --> 02:12:55.630
<v Speaker 2>You don't got to tell him twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They usually those are dogs or you have </v>

<v Speaker 2>that they can't just lay around like a </v>

2787
02:13:00.850 --> 02:13:00.850
<v Speaker 2>bulldog,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Those are fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lazy dogs.</v>

2789
02:13:00.850 --> 02:13:02.540
<v Speaker 2>They'll just lay around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shepherds would be like,</v>

2790
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:03.920
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta get out of this yard.</v>

2791
02:13:04.070 --> 02:13:05.360
<v Speaker 2>I got to figure out where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking yard.</v>

2792
02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:07.160
<v Speaker 2>They'll climb trees and shit.</v>

2795
02:13:10.910 --> 02:13:13.850
<v Speaker 2>That's where the good police dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shepherds and those other ones that look</v>

2796
02:13:13.851 --> 02:13:16.640
<v Speaker 2>like shepherds was belgian and ellen was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think they're called the malamute,</v>

2799
02:13:20.070 --> 02:13:22.550
<v Speaker 2>two different dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never owned shepherd prior to these</v>

2800
02:13:22.551 --> 02:13:26.740
<v Speaker 2>two nights and they're great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had like golden retrievers like,</v>

2801
02:13:27.150 --> 02:13:32.150
<v Speaker 2>but my shepherd's aren't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are afraid of them because they </v>

2802
02:13:32.150 --> 02:13:32.150
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2803
02:13:32.150 --> 02:13:32.150
<v Speaker 2>if you see them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

2804
02:13:32.150 --> 02:13:32.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2805
02:13:32.170 --> 02:13:35.340
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That my brother and his wife,</v>

2806
02:13:35.660 --> 02:13:38.300
<v Speaker 6>they have rottweilers and I've never </v>
<v Speaker 6>been in it for.</v>

2807
02:13:38.370 --> 02:13:40.050
<v Speaker 6>You just have mentally in your head </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2808
02:13:40.051 --> 02:13:42.060
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>rottweilers are rough.</v>

2809
02:13:42.330 --> 02:13:44.700
<v Speaker 6>They couldn't be a nicer dog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are good dogs.</v>

2810
02:13:44.701 --> 02:13:49.701
<v Speaker 6>Like if you raised right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had a buddy of mine who had a really </v>

2811
02:13:49.701 --> 02:13:49.701
<v Speaker 6>good one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a sweetheart.</v>

2812
02:13:49.780 --> 02:13:52.170
<v Speaker 6>The drunk kids like him,</v>
<v Speaker 6>five-year-old,</v>

2813
02:13:52.171 --> 02:13:54.360
<v Speaker 6>he earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's three liaison.</v>

2814
02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:59.420
<v Speaker 6>The rottweiler,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like he's watching tv and the dog will </v>

2815
02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:02.151
<v Speaker 6>just sit there and I started wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 6>with them a little bit or like tickle </v>

2816
02:14:02.151 --> 02:14:05.491
<v Speaker 6>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The rottweiler came in between us and </v>

2817
02:14:05.491 --> 02:14:05.700
<v Speaker 6>just kind of plopped down just to kind </v>
<v Speaker 6>of go,</v>

2818
02:14:05.701 --> 02:14:10.701
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've had enough of the tickle fight.</v>

2819
02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:16.220
<v Speaker 6>Dogs are interesting because so much of </v>
<v Speaker 6>a dog's personality is based on the </v>

2820
02:14:16.220 --> 02:14:18.300
<v Speaker 6>breeder and how well the breeder takes </v>
<v Speaker 6>care of the parents.</v>

2821
02:14:18.301 --> 02:14:23.301
<v Speaker 6>And the generations before,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I got this dog that's a regency </v>

2822
02:14:23.301 --> 02:14:24.020
<v Speaker 6>mast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you ever seen my tongue.</v>

2823
02:14:24.170 --> 02:14:29.170
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his dad was on fear factor and his dad </v>

2824
02:14:29.170 --> 02:14:30.810
<v Speaker 6>was so chill.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was just such a sweet dog.</v>

2825
02:14:30.811 --> 02:14:34.410
<v Speaker 6>He's just hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like he was just like real calm and like</v>

2826
02:14:34.411 --> 02:14:37.200
<v Speaker 6>real sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then he used them as an attack dog.</v>

2827
02:14:37.230 --> 02:14:42.230
<v Speaker 6>Like he had a big dog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you like taken out people in those </v>

2828
02:14:42.230 --> 02:14:45.681
<v Speaker 6>big attack dog suits and this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he won't even breed dogs if they have </v>

2829
02:14:45.751 --> 02:14:48.930
<v Speaker 6>any aggression towards people because </v>
<v Speaker 6>any growlin or barking at eight,</v>

2830
02:14:48.990 --> 02:14:53.990
<v Speaker 6>like he'll try and take their food away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He'll do all kinds of different things </v>

2831
02:14:53.990 --> 02:14:54.450
<v Speaker 6>to test them and he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's always kind to them.</v>

2832
02:14:54.451 --> 02:14:57.960
<v Speaker 6>But if they show any sign of aggression </v>
<v Speaker 6>towards people,</v>

2833
02:14:58.110 --> 02:15:03.110
<v Speaker 6>he doesn't breed them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so because of that he has is like </v>

<v Speaker 6>Oh the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2895
02:17:48.820 --> 02:17:52.240
<v Speaker 6>The ads are on every one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to get that magazine.</v>

2896
02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:57.270
<v Speaker 6>The magazine itself was like an alien </v>
<v Speaker 6>because it was just fun to like go </v>

2897
02:17:57.270 --> 02:18:00.631

<v Speaker 6>Oh fuck.</v>

2898
02:18:00.791 --> 02:18:02.950
<v Speaker 6>What was I going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Elephant in the room.</v>

2899
02:18:03.070 --> 02:18:03.940
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>elephant in the room.</v>

2900
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:09.150
<v Speaker 6>Elephant in the room is a movie about </v>
<v Speaker 6>all these people that keep exotic pets </v>

2901
02:18:09.150 --> 02:18:11.350
<v Speaker 6>in their home.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like lions and shit.</v>

2902
02:18:11.890 --> 02:18:16.210
<v Speaker 6>Like this guy had this weird </v>
<v Speaker 6>relationship with this lion and it would</v>

2903
02:18:16.211 --> 02:18:18.540
<v Speaker 6>go in the cage with a lion and hug it </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he's like,</v>

2904
02:18:18.550 --> 02:18:19.300
<v Speaker 6>this lion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2905
02:18:19.330 --> 02:18:21.430
<v Speaker 6>kept me alive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If I didn't have this line,</v>

2906
02:18:21.431 --> 02:18:22.750
<v Speaker 6>I would have been dead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2907
02:18:22.751 --> 02:18:25.240
<v Speaker 6>I had my broke my back in a truck </v>
<v Speaker 6>driving accident.</v>

2908
02:18:25.241 --> 02:18:27.940
<v Speaker 6>I was all fucked up on pills and I got </v>
<v Speaker 6>this lion and it's like,</v>

2909
02:18:28.180 --> 02:18:29.590
<v Speaker 6>it's so weird.</v>

2910
02:18:29.770 --> 02:18:31.660
<v Speaker 6>It's so weird watching this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2911
02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:36.720
<v Speaker 6>don't they eventually kill you like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>lion would even though you know you're </v>

2912
02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:37.120
<v Speaker 6>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anything just have a bad day.</v>

2913
02:18:37.121 --> 02:18:40.840
<v Speaker 6>And just sometimes they do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes they do,</v>

2914
02:18:40.841 --> 02:18:45.841
<v Speaker 6>but I think if you pay attention to all </v>
<v Speaker 6>these motherfuckers that have lines and </v>

2915
02:18:45.841 --> 02:18:46.090
<v Speaker 6>how few of them actually wind up killing</v>
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

2916
02:18:46.510 --> 02:18:50.440
<v Speaker 6>I think if you train them correctly and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you were there all the time,</v>

2917
02:18:50.680 --> 02:18:55.680
<v Speaker 6>it's probably at least reasonably safe </v>
<v Speaker 6>when they seem to attack is when they </v>

2918
02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:58.390
<v Speaker 6>get agitated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the siegfried and roy thing.</v>

2919
02:18:58.510 --> 02:18:59.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>

2920
02:18:59.161 --> 02:19:04.161
<v Speaker 6>I'm not there were thin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're thinking that it might've been </v>

2921
02:19:04.161 --> 02:19:06.451
<v Speaker 6>because some lady in the audience had </v>
<v Speaker 6>some crazy hat on and that the tiger </v>

2922
02:19:06.821 --> 02:19:09.730
<v Speaker 6>might've seen that hat as like a cobra,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like something,</v>

2923
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:14.990
<v Speaker 6>a peacock,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some fucking crazy animal like remember </v>

2924
02:19:14.990 --> 02:19:16.810
<v Speaker 6>in jurassic park when the fucking Wayne </v>
<v Speaker 6>Knight is trying to steal and that thing</v>

2925
02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:21.130
<v Speaker 6>shows up in the car with them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like maybe that's what the tiGer thought</v>

2926
02:19:21.131 --> 02:19:26.131
<v Speaker 6>that hat was like something similar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like something alerting him that it was </v>

2927
02:19:26.131 --> 02:19:28.090
<v Speaker 6>about to attack will show is talking the</v>
<v Speaker 6>whole time or just as</v>

2928
02:19:28.090 --> 02:19:29.230
<v Speaker 4>a performer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The tigers,</v>

2929
02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:34.520
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck this second show friday they said </v>

2930
02:19:35.691 --> 02:19:40.691
<v Speaker 4>that it wasn't even trying to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just dragging them out of there </v>

2931
02:19:40.691 --> 02:19:43.780
<v Speaker 4>and that it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It had no idea like the biting him on </v>

2932
02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:44.780
<v Speaker 4>the neck would just crushes vertebrae </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's just so strong.</v>

2933
02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:46.250
<v Speaker 4>It was trying to just get him out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2934
02:19:47.020 --> 02:19:51.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I buy that and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>he just got sick of working for him.</v>

2935
02:19:52.770 --> 02:19:57.770
<v Speaker 4>It could have a guy got killed a couple </v>
<v Speaker 4>of days ago or he got mauled,</v>

2936
02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:00.860
<v Speaker 4>went into a line enclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>climbed in.</v>

2937
02:20:00.861 --> 02:20:05.861
<v Speaker 4>It's like the third guy this year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was an indian guy that got killed </v>

2938
02:20:05.861 --> 02:20:05.861

<v Speaker 4>That was the most ridiculous.</v>

2941
02:20:08.421 --> 02:20:13.421
<v Speaker 4>Whenever you guys on hIs knees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like annoying the shit out of the tiger </v>

<v Speaker 4>you fucking annoying bitch pam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He grabs him and just drag them over to </v>

2947
02:20:22.041 --> 02:20:23.540
<v Speaker 4>the other side of the enclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he's a pillow.</v>

2948
02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:26.120
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know when to watch it.</v>

2949
02:20:27.310 --> 02:20:30.080
<v Speaker 4>Put It up on this thing here so we don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>get pulled from youtube.</v>

2950
02:20:30.081 --> 02:20:32.900
<v Speaker 4>We have a strategy now for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it showing videos.</v>

2951
02:20:33.570 --> 02:20:38.570
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well we keep getting pulled from </v>

2952
02:20:38.570 --> 02:20:41.351
<v Speaker 4>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every time we show videos now we don't </v>

2953
02:20:41.351 --> 02:20:41.351
<v Speaker 4>really show them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so sort of show them over on that side.</v>

2954
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:45.170
<v Speaker 4>So it's not the actual video playing on </v>
<v Speaker 4>our youtuBe channel.</v>

2955
02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:47.690
<v Speaker 4>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

2956
02:20:47.900 --> 02:20:50.040
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to not have anybody steal</v>

2957
02:20:50.041 --> 02:20:55.041
<v Speaker 4>a views from them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it probably in the long run </v>

2958
02:20:55.041 --> 02:20:56.630
<v Speaker 4>gets you more views Because people don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to see it just on the podcast.</v>

2959
02:20:56.630 --> 02:20:58.070
<v Speaker 4>They want to tell their friends about </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2960
02:20:58.100 --> 02:21:03.100
<v Speaker 4>Did you hear the link?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they're gonna go to the actual </v>

2961
02:21:03.100 --> 02:21:03.260
<v Speaker 4>length.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I get it.</v>

2962
02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:06.830
<v Speaker 4>I guess they called fair use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what Fair use is.</v>

2963
02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:09.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm not exactly sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems debatable.</v>

2964
02:21:09.380 --> 02:21:13.040
<v Speaker 4>There's like a debatable definition for </v>
<v Speaker 4>fair use.</v>

2965
02:21:13.220 --> 02:21:15.800
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this fucking dude gets jacked.</v>

2966
02:21:15.860 --> 02:21:17.230
<v Speaker 4>That's what's important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>John fraud.</v>

2967
02:21:17.540 --> 02:21:22.490
<v Speaker 4>This guy gets fucking jacked and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason,</v>

2968
02:21:22.520 --> 02:21:27.320
<v Speaker 4>he thinks it's smart to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fucking keep praying.</v>

2969
02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:30.620
<v Speaker 4>Like the tiger gets like right on top of</v>
<v Speaker 4>him and he just,</v>

2970
02:21:30.890 --> 02:21:33.530
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't stay still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't play dead.</v>

2971
02:21:33.740 --> 02:21:36.350
<v Speaker 4>He just keeps bobbing back and forth and</v>
<v Speaker 4>up and down,</v>

2972
02:21:36.351 --> 02:21:38.420
<v Speaker 4>back and forth and up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And eventually the tigers like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Do you have?</v>

3105
02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:08.910
<v Speaker 2>My wife called me out on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She used to watch the kardashians and </v>

3106
02:28:08.910 --> 02:28:11.200
<v Speaker 2>I'd always just go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just making it just it gum.</v>

3107
02:28:11.201 --> 02:28:13.400
<v Speaker 2>It makes you dumber than human being </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching.</v>

3108
02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:16.930
<v Speaker 2>But the one of the husbands on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough,</v>

3109
02:28:16.931 --> 02:28:21.410
<v Speaker 2>the guy who looks like a psycho white </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude with his slicked back hair.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's married to the older sister.</v>

3112
02:28:26.690 --> 02:28:29.720

3113
02:28:29.780 --> 02:28:31.670

<v Speaker 2>deal with people.</v>

<v Speaker 2>So I would go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

3171
02:31:03.240 --> 02:31:06.840
<v Speaker 2>And then every famous porn star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it was really weird because you just</v>

3172
02:31:06.841 --> 02:31:11.841
<v Speaker 2>see and tHen you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just signed a treadmill next to the </v>

3173
02:31:11.841 --> 02:31:12.120
<v Speaker 2>rock and after like week two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just like,</v>

3174
02:31:12.890 --> 02:31:14.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get used to some people.</v>

3175
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:19.790
<v Speaker 2>I watched a guy go up to the rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rock always did you have headphones </v>

3176
02:31:20.341 --> 02:31:22.020
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he's like lifting,</v>

3177
02:31:22.050 --> 02:31:24.150
<v Speaker 2>he kinda has this look of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3178
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:25.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm working out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3179
02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:27.600
<v Speaker 2>it kind of has to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So uh,</v>

3180
02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:31.320
<v Speaker 2>so this guy walks over to him and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3181
02:31:31.830 --> 02:31:33.630
<v Speaker 2>could you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you help me out?</v>

3182
02:31:34.050 --> 02:31:35.490
<v Speaker 2>And you saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took off his head,</v>

3183
02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:36.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was mid workout.</v>

3184
02:31:36.721 --> 02:31:39.750
<v Speaker 2>He's like doing squats or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ask somebody.</v>

3185
02:31:40.320 --> 02:31:44.610
<v Speaker 2>But the rocks is probably one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nicest guys I've ever seen.</v>

3186
02:31:45.270 --> 02:31:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Like on a side note,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've seen him on flight at 6:00</v>

3187
02:31:48.841 --> 02:31:53.841
<v Speaker 2>in the morning tea with his head up </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the window and hat down and </v>

3188
02:31:53.841 --> 02:31:55.110
<v Speaker 2>little kids tapping on them and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>put his head up,</v>

3189
02:31:55.270 --> 02:32:00.270
<v Speaker 2>throw on the smile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>signed for the kid and then go back to </v>

3190
02:32:00.270 --> 02:32:03.591
<v Speaker 2>sleep for a second to the next kid and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's never not seen him be cool like </v>

3191
02:32:03.591 --> 02:32:07.521
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at the gym he walks over to the guy </v>

3192
02:32:07.521 --> 02:32:08.280
<v Speaker 2>and I'm now I'm just like staring at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy goes,</v>

3193

<v Speaker 2>Can you tell me if I'm doing them right?</v>

3194
02:32:11.860 --> 02:32:16.860

<v Speaker 2>like probably the only weight lifting </v>

<v Speaker 2>You don't need actual post my like a </v>

3198
02:32:24.500 --> 02:32:27.780
<v Speaker 2>And then mid curl can we be friends?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are you doing later?</v>

3199

<v Speaker 2>He's gigantic.</v>

3209
02:32:53.610 --> 02:32:58.610
<v Speaker 2>Could you want me to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen them in different phases of a </v>

3210
02:32:58.610 --> 02:32:58.610
<v Speaker 2>pussy magnet almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3211
02:32:58.610 --> 02:33:02.720
<v Speaker 2>it must be like a black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a singularity of sexual attraction.</v>

3212
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:05.560
<v Speaker 2>He's like six foot three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3213
02:33:05.970 --> 02:33:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Six threeish boarish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone else built like a brick shit </v>

3214
02:33:10.970 --> 02:33:12.990
<v Speaker 2>house and he's a movie star goes lower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seen those pictures that he would.</v>

3215
02:33:13.500 --> 02:33:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Probably not that he posts pictures on </v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram when he's working out.</v>

3216
02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:21.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like his cheat days are like the </v>

3217
02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:25.880
<v Speaker 2>legendary legendary for big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge pizzas and never seen anything like</v>

3218
02:33:26.441 --> 02:33:27.860
<v Speaker 2>that in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3219
02:33:27.861 --> 02:33:30.970
<v Speaker 2>IT's legendary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is this car?</v>

3220
02:33:31.510 --> 02:33:34.680
<v Speaker 2>That's just the part of the diet is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like one day a week you can eat.</v>

3221
02:33:34.680 --> 02:33:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like crazy man.</v>

3222
02:33:36.340 --> 02:33:37.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some guys do that.</v>

3223
02:33:37.321 --> 02:33:39.930
<v Speaker 2>They're super strIct except one day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3224
02:33:39.931 --> 02:33:42.300
<v Speaker 2>one day they just go off your brow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3225
02:33:43.500 --> 02:33:45.810
<v Speaker 2>Remember when eddie bravo yesterday and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunday,</v>

3226
02:33:45.811 --> 02:33:48.390
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would just the ice cream,</v>

3227
02:33:48.420 --> 02:33:51.330
<v Speaker 2>huge sundaes pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would be like atkins,</v>

3228
02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:54.420
<v Speaker 2>atkins for five days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six days rather.</v>

3229
02:33:54.510 --> 02:33:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you'd go five days to do like </v>
<v Speaker 2>two cheat days,</v>

3230
02:33:57.120 --> 02:33:59.250
<v Speaker 2>but it would be super strict on those </v>
<v Speaker 2>atkins days,</v>

3231
02:33:59.251 --> 02:34:04.251
<v Speaker 2>like all salads and meats and very </v>
<v Speaker 2>little carbohydrate other than like </v>

3232
02:34:04.251 --> 02:34:06.060
<v Speaker 2>natural carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So would come from fruits and vegetables</v>

3233
02:34:06.061 --> 02:34:07.160
<v Speaker 2>and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3234
02:34:07.220 --> 02:34:10.320
<v Speaker 2>and then the the last day was just </v>
<v Speaker 2>donuts and pizza.</v>

3235
02:34:10.321 --> 02:34:15.321
<v Speaker 2>You go off like a rocket and you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>give a fuck and he lived for those days </v>

3236
02:34:15.321 --> 02:34:17.770
<v Speaker 2>and then they started starting those </v>
<v Speaker 2>days like midnight on thursday,</v>

3237
02:34:19.730 --> 02:34:21.340
<v Speaker 6>three days and four.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then it's like,</v>

3238
02:34:21.341 --> 02:34:24.470
<v Speaker 6>I'm on atkins one day a week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They do it on mondays.</v>

3239
02:34:25.080 --> 02:34:26.440
<v Speaker 6>Atkins is weird,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3240
02:34:27.130 --> 02:34:28.870
<v Speaker 6>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody really follows that anymore.</v>

3241
02:34:29.430 --> 02:34:32.220
<v Speaker 6>Like people would say that it gives him </v>
<v Speaker 6>bad breath and I guess the.</v>

3242
02:34:32.221 --> 02:34:34.760
<v Speaker 6>The idea behind it is if you have no </v>
<v Speaker 6>carbs like that,</v>

3243
02:34:34.780 --> 02:34:38.470
<v Speaker 6>your body just starts to living off fats</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you can do it I guess as long as you</v>

3244
02:34:38.471 --> 02:34:43.471
<v Speaker 6>like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really make sure you have the right </v>

3245
02:34:43.471 --> 02:34:43.471
<v Speaker 6>amount of fats.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tried it for a little while,</v>

3246
02:34:43.471 --> 02:34:44.590
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it made me really feel weak,</v>

3247
02:34:44.860 --> 02:34:48.880
<v Speaker 6>like I didn't feel good cutting out like</v>
<v Speaker 6>potatoes and all that stuff.</v>

3248
02:34:49.870 --> 02:34:53.440
<v Speaker 6>I think cutting it the best I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 6>felt with like an experimental diet.</v>

3249
02:34:53.590 --> 02:34:58.510
<v Speaker 6>It was cutting out gluten and I know </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's like a fad thing to say like that</v>

3250
02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:01.240
<v Speaker 6>and it's so sad that people don't wanna </v>
<v Speaker 6>admit anymore,</v>

3251
02:35:01.540 --> 02:35:04.270
<v Speaker 6>but the reality is this is the simple </v>
<v Speaker 6>reality.</v>

3252
02:35:04.540 --> 02:35:07.780
<v Speaker 6>The reality about breads is they break </v>
<v Speaker 6>down and become sugar.</v>

3253
02:35:07.810 --> 02:35:10.510
<v Speaker 6>Pasta becomes sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the real issue.</v>

3254
02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:15.720
<v Speaker 6>I think more so than like gluten </v>
<v Speaker 6>intolerance and a lot of these other </v>

3255
02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:19.021
<v Speaker 6>things that people claim.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the amount of gluten that we </v>

3256
02:35:19.021 --> 02:35:20.860
<v Speaker 6>have in our diet from sandwiches and </v>
<v Speaker 6>breads and pastas and things along those</v>

3257
02:35:20.861 --> 02:35:25.861
<v Speaker 6>lines,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the amount is a lot of sugar that goes </v>

3258
02:35:25.861 --> 02:35:26.950
<v Speaker 6>into your body and that's just not </v>
<v Speaker 6>healthy.</v>

3259
02:35:27.130 --> 02:35:30.310
<v Speaker 6>It's just spikes your levels.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Your insulin gets all out of whack.</v>

3260
02:35:30.610 --> 02:35:35.380
<v Speaker 6>It's just not healthy to have a regular </v>
<v Speaker 6>sugar intake of processed wheat,</v>

3261
02:35:35.650 --> 02:35:40.650
<v Speaker 6>you know all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's like a normal part of the </v>

3262
02:35:40.650 --> 02:35:41.710
<v Speaker 6>american diet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just not that good for you,</v>

3263
02:35:42.190 --> 02:35:44.800
<v Speaker 6>but you know a little bit every now and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then was no big deal.</v>

3264
02:35:44.890 --> 02:35:47.770
<v Speaker 6>It's like if as long as you eat mostly </v>
<v Speaker 6>like healthy foods,</v>

3265
02:35:47.771 --> 02:35:50.680
<v Speaker 6>you could fuck around a little bit every</v>
<v Speaker 6>now and then your body's getting all the</v>

3266
02:35:50.681 --> 02:35:55.681
<v Speaker 6>nutrients it needs and you just sort of </v>
<v Speaker 6>rewarding it with that other stuff is </v>

3267
02:35:55.681 --> 02:35:59.581
<v Speaker 6>the problem is when people have a diet </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's primarily reward and then </v>

3268
02:35:59.581 --> 02:36:00.910
<v Speaker 6>occasionally they fuck around with some </v>
<v Speaker 6>lettuce.</v>

3269
02:36:02.470 --> 02:36:06.010
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like that'S smoothie smoothie today.</v>

3270
02:36:06.011 --> 02:36:11.011

<v Speaker 6>box the way over.</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3275

<v Speaker 6>You're saying stuff that I've kind of </v>

<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3282
02:36:30.940 --> 02:36:35.940

<v Speaker 6>so I'm trying to figure out what my new </v>

3283
02:36:35.940 --> 02:36:35.940
<v Speaker 6>thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you get like a personal trainer and</v>

3284
02:36:35.940 --> 02:36:36.610
<v Speaker 6>in those towns,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3285
02:36:36.611 --> 02:36:38.560
<v Speaker 6>you could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>find someone at the gym,</v>

3286
02:36:38.561 --> 02:36:40.510
<v Speaker 6>they'll put you through like a weight </v>
<v Speaker 6>lift and work out.</v>

3287
02:36:40.510 --> 02:36:42.640
<v Speaker 6>That'd be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll have forced you to do it.</v>

3288
02:36:42.641 --> 02:36:44.530
<v Speaker 6>So I need like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a.</v>

3289
02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:45.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because my,</v>

3290
02:36:45.640 --> 02:36:49.210
<v Speaker 6>my new thing was I'm going to go thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to do pull ups,</v>

3291
02:36:49.270 --> 02:36:50.770
<v Speaker 6>dips,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pushups,</v>

3292
02:36:50.771 --> 02:36:55.771
<v Speaker 6>and then I'm going to do sprints and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then that's going to be it just in case </v>

3293
02:36:55.771 --> 02:36:57.280
<v Speaker 6>I ever get arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then I've started my prison workouts.</v>

3294
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:59.580
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just because I don't.</v>

3295
02:36:59.650 --> 02:37:04.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got to figure out something because </v>

3296
02:37:04.650 --> 02:37:04.650
<v Speaker 6>I'm at that line,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3298
02:37:04.650 --> 02:37:06.850
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think everybody at some point,</v>

3299
02:37:06.910 --> 02:37:11.910
<v Speaker 6>if you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they look like they've given up and </v>

3300
02:37:11.910 --> 02:37:14.581
<v Speaker 6>sometimes that decision is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is later in their lives where I think </v>

3301
02:37:14.581 --> 02:37:16.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm teetering at that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at that decision</v>

3302
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:21.070
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might just give up one doughnut that </v>

<v Speaker 2>never work out and just be done.</v>

<v Speaker 2>button and then she goes,</v>

3343
02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:25.940

<v Speaker 2>your carry on luggage and then she has </v>

3356
02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:05.981
<v Speaker 2>these other workouts where you just put </v>
<v Speaker 2>like four strips of tape on the ground </v>

3357
02:40:06.741 --> 02:40:09.260

<v Speaker 2>bust the hip when you're like 90.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 2>difficult to do than people think it is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I can fucking stallone.</v>

3434
02:43:18.030 --> 02:43:21.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the most ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 4>example ever of a grampy.</v>

3435
02:43:21.790 --> 02:43:23.980
<v Speaker 4>He's like 67,</v>
<v Speaker 4>68 years old,</v>

3436
02:43:23.981 --> 02:43:25.060
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least.</v>

3437
02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:28.390
<v Speaker 4>How old is that dude now you always got </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be at least.</v>

3438
02:43:28.710 --> 02:43:30.130
<v Speaker 4>I would say 68,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3439
02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:31.960
<v Speaker 4>Let's say 68.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seventy two.</v>

3440
02:43:32.110 --> 02:43:37.110
<v Speaker 4>Seventy two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>72 while he's going to be eventually if </v>

3441
02:43:37.110 --> 02:43:38.110
<v Speaker 4>you stayed in the law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when people like,</v>

3442
02:43:38.111 --> 02:43:39.280
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to get off those steroids.</v>

3443

<v Speaker 4>What's he's to what?</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he is.</v>

3446
02:43:44.860 --> 02:43:46.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's ridiculous.</v>

3447
02:43:46.061 --> 02:43:49.090
<v Speaker 4>The Idea that if somehow or another he </v>
<v Speaker 4>got off of them like what?</v>

3448
02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:53.110
<v Speaker 4>He's going to like live 70 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got to run.</v>

3449
02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:55.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I'm don't know.</v>

3450
02:43:55.710 --> 02:44:00.710
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm going to get myself a couple</v>
<v Speaker 4>more years and then I figure I can </v>

3451
02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.710
<v Speaker 4>outrun all the side effects.</v>

3452
02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:05.340
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he broke his neck when he was filming </v>

3453
02:44:05.340 --> 02:44:08.380
<v Speaker 4>the expendables and he was like 65 years</v>
<v Speaker 4>old.</v>

3454
02:44:08.620 --> 02:44:13.620
<v Speaker 4>He fucking fell like they were doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>like some stunt and land on his fucking </v>

3455
02:44:13.620 --> 02:44:17.941
<v Speaker 4>neck and snapped his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's got like disks that are fused </v>

3456
02:44:17.941 --> 02:44:18.040
<v Speaker 4>in his neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He liked put up an x ray online.</v>

3457
02:44:18.041 --> 02:44:20.050
<v Speaker 4>It showed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the crazy shit ever.</v>

3458
02:44:20.170 --> 02:44:23.020
<v Speaker 4>It's going to a fused disc in his neck </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's 67,</v>

3459
02:44:23.021 --> 02:44:26.620
<v Speaker 4>68 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck man?</v>

3460
02:44:27.010 --> 02:44:30.940
<v Speaker 4>Like when we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a 68 year old dude was basically dead.</v>

3461
02:44:31.150 --> 02:44:32.010
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3462
02:44:32.270 --> 02:44:34.870

<v Speaker 4>And when,</v>

3463
02:44:34.871 --> 02:44:36.340
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they come up with,</v>

3464
02:44:36.540 --> 02:44:39.020
<v Speaker 4>if you've seen that thing they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>with mice that,</v>

3465
02:44:39.021 --> 02:44:40.520
<v Speaker 4>that gene doping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3466
02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:40.880
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3467
02:44:40.910 --> 02:44:41.560
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Blood,</v>

3468
02:44:41.620 --> 02:44:46.620
<v Speaker 4>just blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're taking the mice have young mice </v>

3469
02:44:46.620 --> 02:44:47.580
<v Speaker 4>and introducing it to old mice putting </v>
<v Speaker 4>in an old mouse.</v>

3470
02:44:47.580 --> 02:44:52.010
<v Speaker 4>His body and the old mouse starts </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally going back in time like,</v>

3471
02:44:52.390 --> 02:44:54.160
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they've started,</v>

3472
02:44:54.310 --> 02:44:59.310
<v Speaker 4>they've started doing clinical trials </v>
<v Speaker 4>with people and are having positive </v>

3473
02:44:59.310 --> 02:44:59.480
<v Speaker 4>results.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eating babies would make us no,</v>

3474
02:44:59.700 --> 02:45:03.490
<v Speaker 4>no need transfusions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's the thing,</v>

3475
02:45:04.300 --> 02:45:08.770
<v Speaker 4>there was an episode of a goddamn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I quote this website,</v>

3476
02:45:08.771 --> 02:45:13.771
<v Speaker 4>this podcast all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not like I'm not like their </v>

3477
02:45:13.771 --> 02:45:13.771
<v Speaker 4>publicist or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just really think it's awesOme.</v>

3478
02:45:13.771 --> 02:45:16.180
<v Speaker 4>Radiolab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Radiolab is one of the best podcasts.</v>

3479
02:45:16.181 --> 02:45:18.490
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So informative and interesting.</v>

3480
02:45:18.491 --> 02:45:20.950
<v Speaker 4>It's like the sound effects,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like really well engineered.</v>

3481
02:45:21.010 --> 02:45:23.530
<v Speaker 4>IT's like the opposite of like how we do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3482
02:45:23.531 --> 02:45:25.150
<v Speaker 4>We just start and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we fuck around,</v>

3483
02:45:25.151 --> 02:45:27.010
<v Speaker 4>we talk and then we end it with </v>
<v Speaker 4>radiolab.</v>

3484
02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:32.040
<v Speaker 4>Everything's planned out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all really like well edited and </v>

3485
02:45:32.040 --> 02:45:35.040
<v Speaker 4>research and they brIng in different </v>
<v Speaker 4>sound effects and different people and </v>

3486
02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:37.831
<v Speaker 4>they have anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had this one on blood and the </v>

3487
02:45:37.831 --> 02:45:41.041
<v Speaker 4>reality of like blood donating and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>they sell your blood and a lot of the </v>

3488
02:45:41.041 --> 02:45:45.301
<v Speaker 4>blood that you donate doesn't ever go to</v>
<v Speaker 4>patients and a lot of it doesn't go.</v>

3489
02:45:45.551 --> 02:45:50.551
<v Speaker 4>Like if you donate blood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're actually going to sell your </v>

3490
02:45:50.551 --> 02:45:50.551
<v Speaker 4>donated blood to other hospitals for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>profit.</v>

3491
02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:53.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

3492
02:45:54.130 --> 02:45:56.290
<v Speaker 4>It's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you.</v>

3493
02:45:56.460 --> 02:45:58.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to remember the episode here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

3494
02:45:58.781 --> 02:46:00.820
<v Speaker 4>I'll said radio lab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3495
02:46:00.821 --> 02:46:03.760
<v Speaker 4>Radio lab episode on blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll google that real quick.</v>

3496
02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:08.820
<v Speaker 4>He always wondered about that because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>used to give plasma like twice a week </v>

3497
02:46:08.820 --> 02:46:09.690
<v Speaker 4>just to make money and I always wondered</v>
<v Speaker 4>if this was</v>

3498
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:15.190
<v Speaker 2>sold or just I was donating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It never really Made sense that I was </v>

3499
02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:19.361
<v Speaker 2>getting money for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>IT's called blood and I think this one </v>

3500
02:46:19.361 --> 02:46:22.040
<v Speaker 2>deals with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aids as well because there was a guy who</v>

3501
02:46:22.041 --> 02:46:27.041
<v Speaker 2>had hiv and he was doing some art with </v>
<v Speaker 2>his blood and he got labeled a </v>

3502
02:46:27.041 --> 02:46:29.450
<v Speaker 2>terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's one of the same ones,</v>

3503
02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:32.120
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting.</v>

3504
02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:35.180
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the episode they would </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

3505
02:46:35.181 --> 02:46:35.970
<v Speaker 2>What stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3506
02:46:35.971 --> 02:46:40.070
<v Speaker 2>that's season 12 problems had 12 </v>
<v Speaker 2>seasons.</v>

3507
02:46:41.050 --> 02:46:45.680
<v Speaker 2>My god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what steps can be ready for our bodies,</v>

3508
02:46:45.681 --> 02:46:48.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go back in time a little by the tIme,</v>

3509
02:46:48.681 --> 02:46:51.560
<v Speaker 2>let's say add 20 years from now I'll be </v>
<v Speaker 2>40,</v>

3510
02:46:51.561 --> 02:46:53.630
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be in only my fixtures,</v>

3511
02:46:55.070 --> 02:46:58.730
<v Speaker 2>but I'm hoping by then they'll have </v>
<v Speaker 2>something go.</v>

3512
02:46:58.731 --> 02:46:59.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a new.</v>

3513
02:46:59.841 --> 02:47:04.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we figured out how to take your gums </v>

3514
02:47:04.841 --> 02:47:04.841
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

3515
02:47:04.841 --> 02:47:04.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3516
02:47:04.841 --> 02:47:07.770
<v Speaker 2>well what they're doing is apparently </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there,</v>

3517
02:47:07.790 --> 02:47:12.790
<v Speaker 2>you know you can take blood out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and you can donate it and your </v>

3518
02:47:12.790 --> 02:47:15.260
<v Speaker 2>body can produce extra blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you take blood out,</v>

3519
02:47:15.261 --> 02:47:18.830
<v Speaker 2>your body replenisHes that blood and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a bunch of people to do that and</v>

3520
02:47:18.831 --> 02:47:23.831
<v Speaker 2>they sell that blood and say if they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>young you get like a bunch of college </v>

3521
02:47:23.831 --> 02:47:25.870
<v Speaker 2>kids to do that to their blood and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you take this 20 year olds blood and the</v>

3522
02:47:25.871 --> 02:47:30.871
<v Speaker 2>the introduced into your body or your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body like literally reverses the aging </v>

3523
02:47:30.871 --> 02:47:31.160
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start,</v>

3524
02:47:31.161 --> 02:47:36.161
<v Speaker 2>your memory starts working better and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then conversely when you take old blood </v>

3525
02:47:36.161 --> 02:47:39.620
<v Speaker 2>and you pour it into a young kid's body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start getting sluggish.</v>

3526
02:47:39.740 --> 02:47:42.260
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that they're not doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that with people but they are doing that</v>

3527
02:47:42.261 --> 02:47:43.310
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they are.</v>

3528
02:47:43.550 --> 02:47:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they aren't doing the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they did it with mice.</v>

3529
02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:47.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't think it would hurt them </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily physically,</v>

3530
02:47:47.871 --> 02:47:48.620
<v Speaker 2>but it might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3531
02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:53.680
<v Speaker 2>who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We found out a gave kids like fucking </v>

3532
02:47:53.680 --> 02:47:55.990
<v Speaker 2>alzheimer's early or something crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're taking old blood with mice </v>

3533
02:47:56.390 --> 02:47:59.350
<v Speaker 2>and they're introducing it to the young </v>
<v Speaker 2>mice and it fucks them up for you.</v>

3534
02:47:59.390 --> 02:48:04.390
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like a sCary movie where </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually we start harvesting 20 year </v>

3535
02:48:04.390 --> 02:48:07.901
<v Speaker 2>olds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's kinDa like logan's run in the </v>

3536
02:48:07.901 --> 02:48:10.691
<v Speaker 2>sense of you can live until you're 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>But during 20 through 30 or harvest and </v>

3537
02:48:11.451 --> 02:48:13.400
<v Speaker 2>maybe some guy doesn't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>harvested.</v>

3538
02:48:13.430 --> 02:48:18.430
<v Speaker 2>So he hides and runs well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be able to Call it a </v>

3539
02:48:18.430 --> 02:48:22.300
<v Speaker 2>harvest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be able to make </v>

3540
02:48:22.300 --> 02:48:22.300
<v Speaker 2>artificial organs if they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>

3541
02:48:22.300 --> 02:48:22.590
<v Speaker 2>They already can make artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>bladder,</v>

3542
02:48:22.591 --> 02:48:27.591
<v Speaker 2>so I know that they're taking skin cells</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they've created an artificial </v>

3543
02:48:27.591 --> 02:48:28.070
<v Speaker 2>bladder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they make artificial organs,</v>

3544
02:48:28.071 --> 02:48:33.071
<v Speaker 2>they're eventually going to move from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to an artificial Body without a </v>

3545
02:48:33.071 --> 02:48:33.071
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

3546
02:48:33.071 --> 02:48:33.920
<v Speaker 2>You know they're going to have your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking body,</v>

3547
02:48:33.921 --> 02:48:38.921
<v Speaker 2>like an exact version of your body with </v>
<v Speaker 2>no head and they'll Be able to take </v>

3548
02:48:38.921 --> 02:48:38.921
<v Speaker 2>stuff from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take lungs.</v>

3549
02:48:38.921 --> 02:48:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These with a three d printer.</v>

3550
02:48:40.581 --> 02:48:42.290
<v Speaker 2>They just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which I'm going to get so bad,</v>

3551
02:48:42.350 --> 02:48:43.910
<v Speaker 2>buT I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I would print,</v>

3552
02:48:43.970 --> 02:48:46.880
<v Speaker 2>but it's one of those things and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3553
02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:48.260
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be.</v>

3554
02:48:48.350 --> 02:48:53.350
<v Speaker 2>I saw some kid tHree d printed because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow three d printing,</v>

3555
02:48:53.421 --> 02:48:56.150
<v Speaker 2>whatever on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they always like tweet,</v>

3556
02:48:56.510 --> 02:48:58.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut some kid.</v>

3557
02:48:58.790 --> 02:49:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Three d printed a laser engraver for 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks.</v>

3558
02:49:03.020 --> 02:49:06.470
<v Speaker 2>So the laser engraver was like a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand dollars.</v>

3559
02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:11.560
<v Speaker 2>He printed it on a three d printer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made it a plastic and then he engraves </v>

3560
02:49:11.560 --> 02:49:15.090
<v Speaker 2>metal or whatever for some company that </v>
<v Speaker 2>he just does out of his garage.</v>

3561
02:49:15.091 --> 02:49:17.470
<v Speaker 2>But he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I wantEd.</v>

3562
02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:18.180
<v Speaker 2>A three d printer.</v>

3563
02:49:18.180 --> 02:49:19.330
<v Speaker 2>You can print anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

3564
02:49:19.331 --> 02:49:20.990
<v Speaker 2>it would just sit there like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stairmaster,</v>

3565
02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:24.930
<v Speaker 2>not be used like I wouldn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they sell it at a office depot.</v>

3566
02:49:24.931 --> 02:49:29.931
<v Speaker 2>They have this thing you put down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can put an object and then it takes </v>

3567
02:49:29.931 --> 02:49:34.281
<v Speaker 2>a three d picture that's like 2000 bucks</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a three d printer is,</v>

3568
02:49:35.041 --> 02:49:36.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's plastic.</v>

3569
02:49:36.301 --> 02:49:37.280
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A plastic.</v>

3570
02:49:37.410 --> 02:49:42.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now they have all this different </v>

3571
02:49:42.410 --> 02:49:42.410
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do it for food now,</v>

3572
02:49:42.410 --> 02:49:44.430
<v Speaker 2>like pastas you can create but are </v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic or wood,</v>

3573
02:49:44.431 --> 02:49:48.120
<v Speaker 2>like they're coming for the future of </v>
<v Speaker 2>olive garden or restaurants.</v>

3574
02:49:48.121 --> 02:49:53.121
<v Speaker 2>You're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole kitchen is just going to be </v>

<v Speaker 2>I bet it's the future of objects </v>

3579
02:50:00.201 --> 02:50:00.201
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

3580
02:50:00.201 --> 02:50:01.300
