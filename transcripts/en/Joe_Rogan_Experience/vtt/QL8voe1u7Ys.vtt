00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.890
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Fella.</v>

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

5
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Not much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>

7
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.</v>

8
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>We're a little fucking high ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get through it.</v>

9
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm so bummed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about going to Hawaii the</v>

10
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>other day and then his volcano happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

11
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>of all the times I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

12
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were there when it happened.</v>

13
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>It was in Lanai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on one of the other islands.</v>

14
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Did you feel the earthquake?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

15
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.440
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

16
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's separated by quite a lot is a lot</v>

17
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>of water and the way the big earthquake</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened actually after the plane took</v>

18
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we were in the air when the big one</v>

19
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:40.284
<v Speaker 1>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Which it's apparently a big one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a five nine.</v>

21
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it was even more than that.</v>

22
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Was it six?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

23
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

24
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>They had a big one and then they had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking really big one in five night's</v>

25
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the way it works,</v>

26
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure someone will correct me here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the way it works is a five.</v>

27
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Six is like really powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a five,</v>

28
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>seven is twice as powerful than a five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight is twice as powerful as that.</v>

29
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Speaker 1>So when you get up to seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's some world changing shit.</v>

30
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.020
<v Speaker 1>It's actually six point nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

31
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

32
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine being on the icon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that powerful?</v>

33
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>That's so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's such a big earthquake,</v>

34
00:01:19.141 --> 00:01:21.290
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the um,</v>

35
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>I put it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny,</v>

36
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put up anything that's from CNN and</v>

37
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>people want you to put it up from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>verifiable source.</v>

38
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Not Cnn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CNN is bullshit.</v>

39
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fucking asshole.</v>

40
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a video of lava eating a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My stake.</v>

41
00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>CNN faked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was great to say I'll look to see</v>

42
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>conclusive evidence that CNN is not full</v>
<v Speaker 1>of shit.</v>

43
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:47.631
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll go to their website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stupid to people are so goofy,</v>

44
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>so goofy with this fake new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's lava.</v>

45
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.750
<v Speaker 1>It ate a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened.</v>

46
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the video?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

47
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.080
<v Speaker 1>the white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the white car.</v>

48
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Polish it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's good that that cards</v>

49
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 1>forever going to be in rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like when we all died in like the</v>

50
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people can like find this car,</v>

51
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's broken down to the bare elements at</v>

52
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:12.840
<v Speaker 1>this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming it just got completely</v>

53
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 1>melted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

54
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>They say that stuff is 2000 degrees and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so hot,</v>

55
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's molten rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if it didn't burn through your</v>

56
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:26.370
<v Speaker 1>feet or if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you weren't flammable at all for some</v>

57
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:28.050
<v Speaker 1>strange reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could actually walk on it.</v>

58
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.403
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

59
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>I cut thought you would just sink in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

60
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.380
<v Speaker 1>it apparently it's cooling like right</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of after it gets out of the surface.</v>

61
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh this is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like a monster.</v>

62
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>So we're watching this lava flow on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii's big island.</v>

63
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:48.891
<v Speaker 1>I liked how Jamie went with CBS news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro folk the food news.</v>

64
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>Actually Brandon Clement got the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh powerful.</v>

65
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>Brendan Clement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this guy,</v>

66
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>whoever he is a bad motherfucker because</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what he was next to.</v>

67
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 1>He was filming this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was near this thing.</v>

68
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like imagine being on that street and</v>

69
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>staying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of a crazy fuck you have to be</v>

70
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.690
<v Speaker 1>to be on that street and stay and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's six point nine hits during all</v>

71
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so big.</v>

72
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.920
<v Speaker 1>That's such a crazy earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they live on a volcano.</v>

73
00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the reasons why a lot of</v>

74
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 1>people don't want to live on the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>island.</v>

75
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>So shit like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

76
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>that's splatter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One's crazy that there's a fissure in</v>

77
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.550
<v Speaker 1>this neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a subdivision out there and</v>

78
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>something estates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it is,</v>

79
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.480
<v Speaker 1>but they're fucking April.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do the.</v>

80
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground opened up in their</v>

81
00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:39.340
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

82
00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>if you lived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this would be an angry God coming to</v>

84
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 1>attack your village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if normal days you're</v>

85
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>in Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in one of the most beautiful</v>

86
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 1>places on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just chilling and the sun is</v>

87
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>perfect and you'd seen the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear the seagulls and you see</v>

88
00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>dolphins and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the ground opens up and hell</v>

89
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:06.391
<v Speaker 1>starts pouring out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eats your house each Mustang fuck.</v>

90
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:09.920
<v Speaker 1>And they were talking about it today in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news.</v>

91
00:04:09.921 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing we can do.</v>

92
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.740
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing that I can pour water</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

93
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do shit.</v>

94
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too big.</v>

95
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.440
<v Speaker 1>They apparently stopped it from doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something in like Iceland and they had</v>

96
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:29.251
<v Speaker 1>to use billions and billions of gallons</v>
<v Speaker 1>of water to halt the progress of the</v>

97
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:31.890
<v Speaker 1>lava.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was.</v>

98
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>That big plume was in the air and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't fly anywhere.</v>

99
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>I believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is also that plume being in the</v>

100
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:43.000
<v Speaker 1>air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which restricted flying is all tied into</v>

101
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 1>the death of that journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Hastings.</v>

102
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

103
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 1>that crazy conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the weirder ones,</v>

104
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:51.940
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the weirder ones.</v>

105
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.090
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Hastings was this sort of</v>

106
00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 1>renegade journalist type character and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went to Iraq or Afghanistan,</v>

107
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say Iraq,</v>

108
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 1>but it might've been Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went there with the troops and he got</v>

109
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:11.491
<v Speaker 1>stuck there because of that volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because you stuck there,</v>

110
00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>everybody got comfortable with him being</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

111
00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 1>They started saying crazy shit to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>joking around about Obama and stuff like</v>

112
00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:23.770
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he put all this in the article and</v>

113
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>when you put all this in the article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that general had to resign and he was</v>

114
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 1>like one of the most popular and most</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful generals in the army.</v>

115
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.030
<v Speaker 1>Then shortly thereafter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homeboy decided to go 120 miles an hour</v>

116
00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:40.590
<v Speaker 1>down sunset and slammed into a tree and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his car exploded and everybody's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that were coming out and they were</v>

119
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:47.044

132
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.350
<v Speaker 1>It turns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll turn,</v>

133
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 1>will make turns for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll park.</v>

134
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.490
<v Speaker 1>They have cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the park.</v>

135
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they figured out a long time ago</v>

136
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be cool if we could just tap</v>

137
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 1>into that and make this motherfucker</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive into a tree or star kids?</v>

138
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>They didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would be so incompetent that I</v>

139
00:06:29.151 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 1>don't want to hear any conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories ever again because of the</v>

140
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 1>government didn't look at that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the government like this assassins</v>

141
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.990
<v Speaker 1>didn't look at that angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bobo Bobo.</v>

142
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you telling me if the head of Isis is</v>

143
00:06:41.031 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 1>in a car and it's a Mercedes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can hack into that car and make that</v>

144
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker drive off a cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can do that.</v>

145
00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's do that</v>

146
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.713
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>

147
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Those people all day of trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out a way to kill bad guys.</v>

148
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:56.060
<v Speaker 1>You don't think they would think that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they would.</v>

149
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:59.960
<v Speaker 1>So that's the scary thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the other possibility is</v>

150
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 1>homeboy was losing his mind because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pressure,</v>

151
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.770
<v Speaker 1>which is entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always have to like look at</v>

152
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:08.600
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to look at all sides.</v>

153
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.190
<v Speaker 1>You really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>

154
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:15.220
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy to just pick a side on any</v>
<v Speaker 1>story or a conspiracy theory or</v>

155
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.970
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even a political opinion,</v>

156
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 1>so easy to just dig your heels in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in this one you gotta look at this</v>

157
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:24.290
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They definitely found amphetamines in</v>

158
00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 1>his system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

159
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 1>and that's not uncommon for writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Writers love adderall.</v>

160
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.240
<v Speaker 1>It fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>

161
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who's a journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says everybody who's a journalist is on</v>

162
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:36.590

163
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:38.450
<v Speaker 1>He's exaggerating the one guy's out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

168
00:07:50.061 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>the stem cell doctor from Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was telling me about people that were</v>

169
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:57.530
<v Speaker 1>taken adderall like when he was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>college and he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>allegedly.</v>

177
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I just made that up officer.</v>

178
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the fuck that was.</v>

179
00:08:22.911 --> 00:08:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't take it either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

180
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm scared of it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

183
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Like the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same reason.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I like coffee too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

186
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.060
<v Speaker 1>I drink it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not even tired.</v>

187

<v Speaker 1>I'll just look for a cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like come on in,</v>

189
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.980
<v Speaker 1>cracky when I'm on adderall lake as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>could get into like the whole time to</v>

<v Speaker 1>make you talk too much.</v>

191
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only done like three times,</v>

192
00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:54.050
<v Speaker 1>but I remember I tried to do it and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>on stage and it was awful.</v>

193
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.240
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I was on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My timing was all like jeter,</v>

194
00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:57.931
<v Speaker 1>Gdg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>

195
00:08:57.931 --> 00:08:59.800
<v Speaker 1>gender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you got to take into account like</v>

196
00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.700
<v Speaker 1>there's the way you feel before you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>onstage and it there's the way you feel</v>

197
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.860
<v Speaker 1>onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the adrenaline you have to take into</v>

198
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:06.560
<v Speaker 1>account that that adrenaline is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be there.</v>

199
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of mix in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

200
00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I did modafinil once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did modafinil on stage and it was a</v>

201
00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:14.850
<v Speaker 1>weird little balancing act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's that pro vigil stuff,</v>

202
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>

203
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:17.550
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

204
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 1>this is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

205
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 1>you better off sober.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just put the.</v>

206
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:27.051
<v Speaker 1>The thing about those pills apparently</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he get used to it and then you get</v>

207
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:29.430
<v Speaker 1>used to that juice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

208
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:31.740
<v Speaker 1>you're used to just fucking have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy to get shit done.</v>

209
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Come on Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's start a fucking business.</v>

210
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Come on Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's organize.</v>

211
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.460
<v Speaker 1>We've got to make a nonprofit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>carries the same name as</v>

212
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 1>everybody gets super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super fired up,</v>

213
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.430
<v Speaker 1>but you can get a lot of shit done that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

214
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.520
<v Speaker 1>So that's the thing with journalists</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently according to my friend,</v>

215
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:48.661
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

216
00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:50.940
<v Speaker 1>everybody's on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all on it and they write like</v>

217
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 1>maniacs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just fucking pound the keys.</v>

218
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 1>But it makes sense in that take your</v>
<v Speaker 1>pills documentary on Netflix.</v>

219
00:09:57.811 --> 00:10:00.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what they talk about too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to see that percent of kids in</v>

220
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 1>high school college taking it to stick</v>
<v Speaker 1>it through.</v>

221
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a performance enhancing</v>

222
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:07.140
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the question.</v>

223
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Is it worse than drinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it isn't and we don't have any</v>

224
00:10:12.451 --> 00:10:15.960
<v Speaker 1>problem with all those kids drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

225
00:10:15.961 --> 00:10:19.080
<v Speaker 1>are they going to get addicted to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>more easily than they would get addicted</v>

226
00:10:19.081 --> 00:10:20.810
<v Speaker 1>to drinking because you don't have this.</v>

227
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:22.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

228
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.810
<v Speaker 1>but I'm assuming you don't have nearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same kind of hangout where right.</v>

229
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:26.080
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

230
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.070
<v Speaker 1>how does it affect your liver in</v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison to like alcohol?</v>

231
00:10:29.071 --> 00:10:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Because I think adderall and that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of shit.</v>

232
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.280
<v Speaker 1>Fuck might be worse in that aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd see a lot of bodies if it</v>

233
00:10:36.691 --> 00:10:39.240
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there'd be a lot of dead people.</v>

234
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.610
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think.</v>

235
00:10:41.611 --> 00:10:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of those where's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body's thing like where's the bodies?</v>

236
00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:47.010
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.370
<v Speaker 1>where are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be one of those things.</v>

238
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do lot of buddies</v>

239
00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:52.940
<v Speaker 1>going to have to flex and Dolly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

240
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.710
<v Speaker 1>are you sure you sure everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>already doing it.</v>

241
00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Booze,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was a fucking stupid article</v>

242
00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:03.000
<v Speaker 1>that I was reading about the Keto Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so dumb.</v>

243
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:08.130
<v Speaker 1>He was so poorly written and uninformed</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were talking about a study</v>

244
00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:12.930
<v Speaker 1>they did where they took people and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>put them on a Keto diet for four days</v>

245
00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:17.670
<v Speaker 1>and their athletic performance decreased</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they even included the caveat</v>

246
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:21.390
<v Speaker 1>this could possibly be because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keto flu,</v>

247
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.650
<v Speaker 1>which is something that sometimes people</v>
<v Speaker 1>get when their body goes into before</v>

248
00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:29.130
<v Speaker 1>your body goes into Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes a long time to switch your body</v>

249
00:11:29.131 --> 00:11:32.580
<v Speaker 1>off from a lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but burning carbs to burning fat.</v>

250
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.820
<v Speaker 1>The real health benefits in athletic</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>

251
00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:40.821
<v Speaker 1>if any all happen after your body gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>through this transitionary period,</v>

252
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.070
<v Speaker 1>so they did a study about four days of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Diet,</v>

253
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.200
<v Speaker 1>like who gives a shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you do that?</v>

254
00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:49.710
<v Speaker 1>That's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes weeks before your body even</v>

255
00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:54.711
<v Speaker 1>totally transitions over and then even</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the benefits and include increased</v>

256
00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 1>rather over months.</v>

257
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot plenty of science on this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the people that have had on the</v>

258
00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:02.380
<v Speaker 1>podcast that talked about it like Dom</v>
<v Speaker 1>D'agostino and all the studies that he's</v>

259
00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:03.410
<v Speaker 1>done on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

260
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Peter Attia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's on the other day,</v>

261
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.760
<v Speaker 1>he's like real scientists who are like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

262
00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:11.320
<v Speaker 1>the data's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could look at it.</v>

263
00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work for everybody in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the benefits of it,</v>

264
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.790
<v Speaker 1>but you don't do it over four days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>

265
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.680
<v Speaker 1>So they're saying it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potentially dangerous dive.</v>

266
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.300
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not dangerous.</v>

267
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 1>You know what's really dangerous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eating the same way most people eat</v>

268
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:27.150
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I was while I was watching</v>

269
00:12:27.151 --> 00:12:28.810
<v Speaker 1>a video with this guy from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.290
<v Speaker 1>the company called Flavor God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that.</v>

271
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a spice company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He makes really delicious spices.</v>

272
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.950
<v Speaker 1>And he had this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went to a store and he just picked</v>

273
00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:40.250
<v Speaker 1>out a garlic salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

274
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:41.500
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try this one right here.</v>

275
00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:44.350
<v Speaker 1>And he picks it up and it says sugar in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

276
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>third ingredient in fucking garlic salt.</v>

277
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.720
<v Speaker 1>So I go home after I watched this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pick up the car.</v>

278
00:12:50.721 --> 00:12:52.330
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that looks like the shit that I have in</v>

279
00:12:52.331 --> 00:12:53.920
<v Speaker 1>my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I pick it up.</v>

280
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:57.250
<v Speaker 1>It's under garlic salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has fucking loves sugar.</v>

281
00:12:57.251 --> 00:12:59.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like the third or fourth ingredient</v>
<v Speaker 1>is sugar.</v>

282
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be kidding me.</v>

283
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.570
<v Speaker 1>They put sugar in garlic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>salt these monsters.</v>

284
00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.910
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not right dude.</v>

285
00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.270
<v Speaker 1>These monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he selling it as a spice or is it say</v>

286
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:14.930
<v Speaker 1>garlic salt on it says regular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big company.</v>

287
00:13:14.931 --> 00:13:17.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a green cap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says garlic salt.</v>

288
00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:21.710
<v Speaker 1>His stuff is just garlic and salt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>real spices and whatever.</v>

289
00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.140
<v Speaker 1>This flavor God guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's just pointing out like,</v>

290
00:13:24.141 --> 00:13:25.880
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting fucked over.</v>

291
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.560
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea I was pouring this dye.</v>

292
00:13:28.561 --> 00:13:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Put this stuff on my eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know there's sugar in it.</v>

293
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.370
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you put sugar in garlic?</v>

294
00:13:34.371 --> 00:13:35.600
<v Speaker 1>Salt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got the.</v>

295
00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Don't call it garlic salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then call it Tony Spices.</v>

296
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.390
<v Speaker 1>This is Tony Spices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put a little of this.</v>

297
00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I put a little of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I like?</v>

298
00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:45.320
<v Speaker 1>My grandmother always put sugar in</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

299
00:13:45.321 --> 00:13:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sugar.</v>

300
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.190
<v Speaker 1>It seems like that should be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be illegal.</v>

301
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Fucking asshole.</v>

302
00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:50.901
<v Speaker 1>Because if.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

303
00:13:50.901 --> 00:13:54.410
<v Speaker 1>If you can't have sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never think to look and check every</v>

304
00:13:54.411 --> 00:13:58.240
<v Speaker 1>fucking label to make sure someone's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>sneaking some sugar in on you.</v>

305
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Creepy fucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking and creepy fucks.</v>

306
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear about that nurse who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to jail because she was infecting</v>

307
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:10.490
<v Speaker 1>patients with HIV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Hepatitis C.</v>

308
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:15.490
<v Speaker 1>She was infecting her hepatitis c blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>into their medication.</v>

309
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.561
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

310
00:14:17.561 --> 00:14:19.930
<v Speaker 1>she's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's crazy.</v>

311
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.920
<v Speaker 1>She was giving them Hep c on purpose is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're alleging.</v>

312
00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.700
<v Speaker 1>At least here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nurse allegedly used her own drug</v>

313
00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:31.060
<v Speaker 1>needles on patients leading to hepatitis</v>
<v Speaker 1>C infections.</v>

314
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'd read it differently.</v>

315
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.340
<v Speaker 1>I'd read that she injected the</v>
<v Speaker 1>medication with her blood.</v>

316
00:14:39.341 --> 00:14:43.980
<v Speaker 1>She had put her blood in the medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that was just a shitty article I</v>

317
00:14:43.981 --> 00:14:46.320
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but either way.</v>

318
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what they're saying is</v>

319
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.840
<v Speaker 1>she's suspicious of two counts of second</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree assault.</v>

320
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.490
<v Speaker 1>She's not been formally charged and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother Eunice told the media at the news</v>

321
00:14:58.491 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 1>conference prior to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her daughter wouldn't hurt a bug.</v>

322
00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So say a Washington emergency room</v>

323
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:07.730
<v Speaker 1>nurses accused of stealing narcotics and</v>
<v Speaker 1>injecting to hospital patients with Hep</v>

324
00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:11.420
<v Speaker 1>c using the same needles that she used</v>
<v Speaker 1>to inject herself.</v>

325
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the not saying she infected it with</v>

326
00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:15.860
<v Speaker 1>her blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their blood on purpose.</v>

327
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.220
<v Speaker 1>She just did something super</v>
<v Speaker 1>irresponsible and used her needles on</v>

328
00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:22.220
<v Speaker 1>these patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what she did was.</v>

329
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:26.750
<v Speaker 1>So what they're alleging is that she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>using narcotics and she would get too</v>

330
00:15:26.751 --> 00:15:30.980
<v Speaker 1>much for the patients and give some</v>
<v Speaker 1>theirself and they use that same needle</v>

331
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:35.180
<v Speaker 1>to give it to the patients probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>because needles are tightly controlled</v>

332
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.540
<v Speaker 1>because they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably have to account for every</v>

333
00:15:38.541 --> 00:15:41.960
<v Speaker 1>needle missing so they don't give them</v>
<v Speaker 1>the junkies and they probably have to</v>

334
00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:43.670
<v Speaker 1>account for all the narcotics.</v>

335
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:48.530
<v Speaker 1>So she would probably give them some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hers since as she intentionally</v>

336
00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:51.500
<v Speaker 1>contaminated medicine or other substance</v>
<v Speaker 1>with her own blood.</v>

337
00:15:51.501 --> 00:15:52.420
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I read.</v>

338
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.540
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a different thing.</v>

339
00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:57.380
<v Speaker 1>This is a different website you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled out intentionally contaminated</v>

340
00:15:57.381 --> 00:16:00.740
<v Speaker 1>medicine or another substance with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own blood.</v>

341
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Then she administered the medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine or other substance</v>

342
00:16:04.341 --> 00:16:07.490
<v Speaker 1>intravenously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the way she did it wasn't by putting</v>

343
00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:10.550
<v Speaker 1>her blood into the medication on</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose.</v>

344
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.330
<v Speaker 1>The way she did it was by taking some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their medication allegedly.</v>

345
00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.910
<v Speaker 1>So I haven't seen any evidence that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have that would prove that she</v>

346
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:22.110
<v Speaker 1>intentionally infected anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

347
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.610
<v Speaker 1>It's her attorney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

348
00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:27.110
<v Speaker 1>that's her attorney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

349
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll go to the top because there was</v>

350
00:16:29.991 --> 00:16:31.410
<v Speaker 1>something about narcotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

351
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.850
<v Speaker 1>I've read this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a book called dead doctors don't</v>

352
00:16:34.851 --> 00:16:38.720
<v Speaker 1>lie and it's all about this Guy Dr Joel</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wallach,</v>

353
00:16:38.721 --> 00:16:41.450
<v Speaker 1>and it was all about mineral deficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>diets.</v>

354
00:16:41.451 --> 00:16:45.140
<v Speaker 1>And then how many people are mineral</v>
<v Speaker 1>deficient diets because us farmlands are</v>

355
00:16:45.141 --> 00:16:47.720
<v Speaker 1>just a totally overrun with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

356
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you use the same land over and over and</v>

357
00:16:50.781 --> 00:16:52.880
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're overrun from the crops,</v>

358
00:16:52.881 --> 00:16:55.970
<v Speaker 1>like just drained the dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have to add minerals to the soil</v>

359
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.010
<v Speaker 1>and they have to add shit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this guy,</v>

360
00:16:58.011 --> 00:17:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Dr Joel Wallach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about how you have to</v>

361
00:17:00.741 --> 00:17:05.741
<v Speaker 1>realize like there's a lot of people out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there that over time mineral deficient</v>

362
00:17:06.021 --> 00:17:09.770
<v Speaker 1>diets will show poor health results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

363
00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:15.220
<v Speaker 1>So he was going on about how little</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctors know about health in general,</v>

364
00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:17.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to fix things,</v>

365
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:20.840
<v Speaker 1>but how little many doctors know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>like good diet and what's important,</v>

366
00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:22.790
<v Speaker 1>what kind of nutrients really need</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they really don't spend that</v>

367
00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:25.640
<v Speaker 1>much time in school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less time than the average person</v>

368
00:17:25.641 --> 00:17:26.720
<v Speaker 1>who sort of obsessed with it.</v>

369
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:30.380
<v Speaker 1>But then he started going on about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many doctors they find dead from</v>

370
00:17:30.381 --> 00:17:35.150
<v Speaker 1>overdoses and stories about doctors that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just shot themselves up in a break room</v>

371
00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:38.900
<v Speaker 1>and tie shot lock themselves up in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bathroom and shot coke.</v>

372
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Like if they're that tired and that worn</v>
<v Speaker 1>down and they have access to coke,</v>

373
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.070
<v Speaker 1>I bet I bet a lot of them did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you could get.</v>

374
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 1>If you get away with it,</v>

375
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.070
<v Speaker 2>especially if they have that liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in the hospitals they're probably</v>

376
00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:56.460
<v Speaker 2>just huffing that stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They still have that liquid coat.</v>

377
00:17:56.461 --> 00:17:58.410
<v Speaker 2>They have lidacain right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they have liquid.</v>

378
00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:02.250
<v Speaker 2>What do they use the liquid coq for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For a numbing agent.</v>

379
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.840
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what Lidocaine is.</v>

380
00:18:03.841 --> 00:18:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing though,</v>

381
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.900
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think a lot of king gets you</v>
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>

382
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.320
<v Speaker 2>I know this girl that used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if she made it,</v>

383
00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:12.720
<v Speaker 2>but I always thought it was from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor.</v>

384
00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.430
<v Speaker 2>It was like an inhaler type thing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would just do that some or.</v>

385
00:18:17.431 --> 00:18:17.701
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

386
00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:20.370
<v Speaker 2>it was a nose thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a sprayed nose thing.</v>

387
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.910
<v Speaker 2>Like a flonase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flonase for coke.</v>

388
00:18:22.911 --> 00:18:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she would just do that and she would</v>

389
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.460
<v Speaker 2>like was just shoot liquid cocoa butter</v>
<v Speaker 2>smell.</v>

390
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:28.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

391
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.360
<v Speaker 2>That sounds better for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then snort and I don't know,</v>

392
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.820
<v Speaker 2>it's like moisturizing.</v>

393
00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.530
<v Speaker 2>The best way is apparently chew those</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaves.</v>

394
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.510
<v Speaker 2>You ever done that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

395
00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.130
<v Speaker 2>I've never even seen that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

396
00:18:41.131 --> 00:18:43.800
<v Speaker 2>the coca leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's apparently the best way,</v>

397
00:18:43.801 --> 00:18:46.380
<v Speaker 2>but you never get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's super rush.</v>

398
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like the difference between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar that you would get from an apple</v>

399
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:54.150
<v Speaker 2>and the sugar you would get from some</v>
<v Speaker 2>koolaid.</v>

400
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.060
<v Speaker 2>Like you drank a gallon of coolant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homemade koolaid.</v>

401
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.820
<v Speaker 2>We dumped extra sugar in there and stir</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bitch up.</v>

402
00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How great was that?</v>

403
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Koolaid is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Delivers your color.</v>

404
00:19:04.231 --> 00:19:07.140
<v Speaker 2>What was your Goto?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never met a cool edit it in like</v>

405
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.740
<v Speaker 2>I never drank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One glass of Koolaid was like,</v>

406
00:19:10.741 --> 00:19:13.370
<v Speaker 2>this is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That green one was always weird.</v>

407
00:19:13.371 --> 00:19:16.380
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved when the big guy with the</v>

408
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.550
<v Speaker 2>pitcher burst through the wall to EU</v>
<v Speaker 2>Koolaid Cooler.</v>

409
00:19:20.551 --> 00:19:24.000
<v Speaker 2>Just smash your house to give you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was so excited to see you and give</v>

410
00:19:24.001 --> 00:19:25.140
<v Speaker 2>you the sugary drink.</v>

411
00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.170
<v Speaker 2>It would break your fucking house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>

412
00:19:28.171 --> 00:19:30.580
<v Speaker 2>Still around the Koolaid guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is he on the.</v>

413
00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.430
<v Speaker 2>On the package is still?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

414
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.440
<v Speaker 2>That'd be funny if they made them</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinner though,</v>

415
00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:37.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to to like promote like no sugar or</v>

416
00:19:37.321 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the change of time.</v>

417
00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.700
<v Speaker 2>Get them on diet pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get kool aid on the Diet pills.</v>

418
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:46.230
<v Speaker 2>The shot glass now had a adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adderall.</v>

419
00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:48.090
<v Speaker 2>Adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

420
00:19:48.091 --> 00:19:50.190
<v Speaker 2>Let's find out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people die every year from</v>

421
00:19:50.191 --> 00:19:51.600
<v Speaker 2>adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's guess.</v>

422
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to guess I'm going to guess</v>
<v Speaker 2>less than a hundred.</v>

423
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:55.740
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

424
00:19:55.741 --> 00:19:58.080
<v Speaker 2>It's way more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say less than a hundred.</v>

425
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.620
<v Speaker 2>$100 in this country every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I say.</v>

426
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:06.420
<v Speaker 2>I say 59 people die of adderall a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say $21,000.</v>

427
00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.820
<v Speaker 2>It would be the worst test ever on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>price is right.</v>

428
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.920
<v Speaker 2>It's just the chance you're taking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't have to go that high.</v>

429
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Go a little higher than when you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

430
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.730
<v Speaker 2>How much have you saved?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fifty nine people.</v>

431
00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.850
<v Speaker 2>Sixty nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty nine.</v>

432
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.300
<v Speaker 2>What do we got?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

433
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:35.100
<v Speaker 2>The first thing I found that said that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were 12 deaths associated to seven</v>

434
00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:38.040
<v Speaker 2>to 16 year old boys in the year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand five and there's like</v>

435
00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:40.980
<v Speaker 2>articles about sudden death and 12 kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>on adderall.</v>

436
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:43.320
<v Speaker 2>So just 12.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

437
00:20:43.321 --> 00:20:45.000
<v Speaker 2>but that's like it's not showing for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

438
00:20:45.001 --> 00:20:47.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when you die on adderall,</v>

439
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 2>they know where you live.</v>

440
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.810
<v Speaker 3>They come down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they nuke your house,</v>

441
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:55.410
<v Speaker 3>that kill all the witnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody this money and adderall must be</v>

442
00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:56.850
<v Speaker 3>through the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

443
00:20:56.851 --> 00:20:59.230
<v Speaker 3>look at what to happen to cbd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear about this?</v>

444
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.870
<v Speaker 3>Like I bet they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the medicine companies have</v>

445
00:21:01.871 --> 00:21:04.630
<v Speaker 3>something to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just made it a schedule one for</v>

446
00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:06.270
<v Speaker 3>CBD.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did they really do that?</v>

447
00:21:06.271 --> 00:21:09.640
<v Speaker 3>I thought they abandoned on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just read it the other day,</v>

448
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 3>a quarter with Kratom to courtrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>CBD scheduled one compound.</v>

449
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Cannabinol sales only were pot legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's just stupid cbd.</v>

450
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:28.110
<v Speaker 3>It's got the most minor levels of thc</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it has a definite benefits,</v>

451
00:21:29.771 --> 00:21:31.840
<v Speaker 3>especially when you put it on as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lotion.</v>

452
00:21:31.841 --> 00:21:36.240
<v Speaker 3>That stuff feels like a court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Appeals Court upholds cbd status as</v>

453
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.210
<v Speaker 3>controlled substance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well fuck you appeals court as against</v>

454
00:21:40.211 --> 00:21:41.620
<v Speaker 3>the hemp industry also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

455
00:21:41.621 --> 00:21:43.110
<v Speaker 3>That's a huge hit to him.</v>

456
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.390
<v Speaker 3>Cross the board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge hit to humanity.</v>

457
00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.670
<v Speaker 3>It's just dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That stuff's great for old ladies.</v>

458
00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:51.130
<v Speaker 3>With arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so much better than a lot of</v>

459
00:21:51.131 --> 00:21:53.440
<v Speaker 3>medications.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can take it in so many different</v>

460
00:21:53.441 --> 00:21:56.050
<v Speaker 3>forms.</v>

<v Speaker 3>along the way.</v>

530
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.920
<v Speaker 3>I've never heard of your theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but does it involve the car accident</v>

531
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.730
<v Speaker 3>that he had right before he became</v>
<v Speaker 3>popular that like,</v>

532
00:24:52.731 --> 00:24:54.940
<v Speaker 3>I think he has brain damage from this</v>
<v Speaker 3>car accident,</v>

533
00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.640
<v Speaker 4>that those are the people that honestly</v>
<v Speaker 4>think that he is still on.</v>

534
00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.500
<v Speaker 4>He.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry,</v>

535
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:05.680
<v Speaker 4>he said he was on opioids from a getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>a light hypo actually because a lot of</v>

536
00:25:06.831 --> 00:25:09.470
<v Speaker 4>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>media scrutiny on them being fat,</v>

537
00:25:09.471 --> 00:25:11.300
<v Speaker 4>he said let them to go getting light</v>
<v Speaker 4>bulb,</v>

538
00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:15.950
<v Speaker 4>which led them to having a painkiller</v>
<v Speaker 4>addiction and he was on an opioid thing</v>

539
00:25:15.951 --> 00:25:19.400
<v Speaker 4>and he was very afraid when he went to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the psych hospital that he was going to</v>

540
00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:21.890
<v Speaker 4>get killed and people are going to take</v>
<v Speaker 4>them away for all the shit he was</v>

541
00:25:21.891 --> 00:25:24.650
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he did have some issues and I think</v>

542
00:25:24.651 --> 00:25:26.570
<v Speaker 4>he's publicly said he has been on some</v>
<v Speaker 4>other,</v>

543
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:28.160
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>medication.</v>

544
00:25:28.161 --> 00:25:29.960
<v Speaker 4>So he might be on or off of it right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

545
00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Well also he should definitely run for</v>
<v Speaker 3>president then scoop.</v>

546
00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now he's in.</v>

547
00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.090
<v Speaker 3>It's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got all the right ingredients as an</v>

548
00:25:39.091 --> 00:25:40.740
<v Speaker 3>artist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just an artist,</v>

549
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:43.080

00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.550
<v Speaker 1>had that to 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

578
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.520
<v Speaker 1>It's not a matter of whether or not you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have brain damage,</v>

579
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.790
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much do you have and can you work</v>

580
00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:55.140
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

581
00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.270
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get hit in the head a lot,</v>

582
00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:01.890
<v Speaker 1>you have brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your brain does not want to get hit.</v>

583
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:05.000
<v Speaker 1>It's just not normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aaron Hernandez suffered from most</v>

584
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:08.550
<v Speaker 1>severe ct ever found in a person his</v>
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>

585
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:13.080
<v Speaker 1>He's kind of like brandon shop here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks like it looks like Brendan's way</v>

586
00:27:13.081 --> 00:27:16.890
<v Speaker 1>more Quito right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very a brain like isn't someone younger</v>

587
00:27:16.891 --> 00:27:20.220
<v Speaker 1>than someone for 46 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 25?</v>

588
00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

589
00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a fucking epidemic.</v>

590
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.300
<v Speaker 1>This shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it includes all sorts of people that</v>

591
00:27:27.301 --> 00:27:31.020
<v Speaker 1>get their head hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a bmx guys that are</v>

592
00:27:31.021 --> 00:27:34.050
<v Speaker 1>constantly crashing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about how many times bmx</v>

593
00:27:34.051 --> 00:27:38.840
<v Speaker 1>guy will crash in his career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many head head bumps he takes 'em</v>

594
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.630
<v Speaker 1>skateboarders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>notorious for doing crazy shit wiping.</v>

595
00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:45.420
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The older you get the kind of like a pit</v>

596
00:27:45.421 --> 00:27:47.640
<v Speaker 1>bull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it swell and it gets worse?</v>

597
00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:50.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

598
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:52.980
<v Speaker 1>They do say though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the damage that cumulative,</v>

599
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:58.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a cumulative cumulative over I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think a period of like 10 years from the</v>

600
00:27:58.381 --> 00:28:01.350
<v Speaker 1>initial incident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like say if you have a really bad car</v>

601
00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:04.860
<v Speaker 1>accident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain will continue to deteriorate</v>

602
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.040
<v Speaker 1>for 10 years from the effects of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>accident.</v>

603
00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

604
00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.310
<v Speaker 1>when the guy told me that I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know?</v>

605
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.870
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how they know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

606
00:28:12.871 --> 00:28:14.940
<v Speaker 1>He kind of explained it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

607
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:16.920
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you mean a guy who gets knocked out?</v>

608
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:18.300
<v Speaker 1>We were at the fights when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me this.</v>

609
00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.060
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you tell me a guy who gets knocked out</v>

610
00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:23.520
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to feel the real</v>

611
00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:25.800
<v Speaker 1>repercussions of that knockout in 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

612
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.371
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

613
00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:27.810
<v Speaker 1>It's very possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the case.</v>

614
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gonna take 10 years to show it's</v>

615
00:28:30.901 --> 00:28:33.570
<v Speaker 1>full effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you see someone who's fucked up</v>

616
00:28:33.571 --> 00:28:36.840
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if they've got brain damage now,</v>

617
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.740
<v Speaker 1>like as time goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be like,</v>

618
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:42.960
<v Speaker 1>like Muhammad Ali was one of the weirder</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones because he had developed a</v>

619
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:45.360
<v Speaker 1>neurological disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He developed Parkinson's.</v>

620
00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.980
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's trauma induced Parkinson's.</v>

621
00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:50.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of people try to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

622
00:28:50.091 --> 00:28:50.401
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

623
00:28:50.401 --> 00:28:51.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got Parkinson's.</v>

624
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:53.070
<v Speaker 1>It was a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

625
00:28:53.071 --> 00:28:54.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

626
00:28:54.331 --> 00:28:56.520
<v Speaker 1>who else has Parkinson's?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freddie Roach,</v>

627
00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:00.480
<v Speaker 1>the boxing coach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he openly discusses the fact that</v>

628
00:29:00.481 --> 00:29:03.480
<v Speaker 1>it's trauma induced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got it from his long boxing career.</v>

629
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Just because it's a brain disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean the brain disease didn't</v>

630
00:29:07.351 --> 00:29:09.810
<v Speaker 1>come from getting the fuck beat out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain.</v>

631
00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:13.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if you had a game that you</v>

632
00:29:13.021 --> 00:29:15.360
<v Speaker 1>played or people like to kick you in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>liver.</v>

633
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.950
<v Speaker 1>This is the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

634
00:29:16.951 --> 00:29:19.260
<v Speaker 1>you kicked me in the liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kick you in the liver and then later</v>

635
00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:22.110
<v Speaker 1>on you develop liver cancer and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

636
00:29:22.111 --> 00:29:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he used to like to drink.</v>

637
00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had sclerosis had nothing to do with</v>

638
00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.320
<v Speaker 1>getting kicked a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

639
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.910
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing to do.</v>

640
00:29:29.911 --> 00:29:34.911
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he has a super healthy brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>after getting pounded on for decades.</v>

641
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.680
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

642
00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

643
00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

644
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.540
<v Speaker 1>I have the probably the most minor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain damages.</v>

645
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.040
<v Speaker 1>President most minor because I stopped</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was 21.</v>

646
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:48.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your number?</v>

647
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:52.120
<v Speaker 1>How many times I got hit and now I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating like how many times do you think</v>

648
00:29:52.121 --> 00:29:53.230
<v Speaker 1>that you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

649
00:29:53.231 --> 00:29:54.840
<v Speaker 1>that did damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

650
00:29:54.841 --> 00:29:57.430
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of them.</v>

651
00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:59.420
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of them that I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>think back.</v>

652
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Getting rocked and filling my knees go</v>
<v Speaker 1>like getting punched in and then keeps</v>

653
00:30:04.901 --> 00:30:05.880
<v Speaker 1>borrowing heaps.</v>

654
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Barring spar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two more rounds.</v>

655
00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:09.610
<v Speaker 1>That guy spar three rounds with another</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

656
00:30:09.611 --> 00:30:12.310
<v Speaker 1>He's hitting you in the face too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you didn't stop.</v>

657
00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:16.150
<v Speaker 1>It was really dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd get hit and you get rocked and you</v>

658
00:30:16.151 --> 00:30:17.980
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody likes sat you down and go,</v>

659
00:30:17.981 --> 00:30:19.240
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take the day off.</v>

660
00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I know you get right back in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

661
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:24.130
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking legs would go bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let your legs would go.</v>

662
00:30:24.131 --> 00:30:29.131
<v Speaker 1>When you cover up and you know people be</v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing bombs on you and you'd next day</v>

663
00:30:29.141 --> 00:30:30.630
<v Speaker 1>sparring again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you.</v>

664
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way to detect it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like at your brain scan?</v>

665
00:30:33.281 --> 00:30:35.590
<v Speaker 1>So there are ways now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's better ways now,</v>

666
00:30:35.591 --> 00:30:37.620
<v Speaker 1>but I had a limited amount of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

667
00:30:37.621 --> 00:30:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I had the real getting wrapped in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>head for me came when I tried to</v>

668
00:30:42.071 --> 00:30:46.450
<v Speaker 1>transition from taekwondo to kick boxing</v>
<v Speaker 1>or doing taekwondo.</v>

669
00:30:46.451 --> 00:30:48.100
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely got hit in the head for</v>

670
00:30:48.101 --> 00:30:50.590
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't get hit in the head as much</v>

671
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:52.540
<v Speaker 1>because it's hard to kick people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

672
00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:53.710
<v Speaker 1>You definitely get hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

673
00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many times I definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>got hit,</v>

674
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.240
<v Speaker 1>but I never got knocked out from a head</v>
<v Speaker 1>kick butt.</v>

675
00:30:58.241 --> 00:31:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I got knocked out from punches before at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least Tko Tko.</v>

676
00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:06.810
<v Speaker 1>But when when a punch hits your face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like your,</v>

677
00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:09.430
<v Speaker 1>your legs go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything shuts off.</v>

678
00:31:09.431 --> 00:31:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Like if you get rocked and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see like a person go down.</v>

679
00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:14.710
<v Speaker 1>It's not that they go down like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

680
00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.060
<v Speaker 1>so much pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to go down.</v>

681
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get hit and everything shuts off.</v>

682
00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.030
<v Speaker 1>It just goes better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you feel your legs like</v>

683
00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.560
<v Speaker 1>rubbery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to stand back up.</v>

684
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:27.100
<v Speaker 1>Did you just watch the last UFC where</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edson Barboza head kick.</v>

685
00:31:27.101 --> 00:31:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that spinning wheel kicked him and</v>

686
00:31:30.011 --> 00:31:33.940
<v Speaker 1>you see Kevin Lee's legs just go blank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just gave out for a second and then</v>

687
00:31:33.941 --> 00:31:38.941
<v Speaker 1>he came back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those those ones I got way more when I</v>

688
00:31:39.821 --> 00:31:43.450
<v Speaker 1>was boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got way more of those like I was.</v>

689
00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.870
<v Speaker 1>I was not good at boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I first got into boxing,</v>

690
00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:48.700
<v Speaker 1>I was learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was good at taekwondo,</v>

691
00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.830
<v Speaker 1>but then I got into boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not good at it.</v>

692
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:53.620
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand the distance.</v>

693
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Taekwondo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't punch in the face and we</v>

694
00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.450
<v Speaker 1>punched the body so you had a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>distorted perception of how good you</v>

695
00:31:58.451 --> 00:32:00.700
<v Speaker 1>were with your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once I started boxing I was</v>

696
00:32:00.701 --> 00:32:01.534
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

697
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:02.800
<v Speaker 1>this is terrible.</v>

698
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:09.900
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was taking like probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most damage of my life of a period</v>

699
00:32:10.121 --> 00:32:12.910
<v Speaker 1>of like two years of like a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sparring,</v>

700
00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:17.320
<v Speaker 1>did a lot of sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's sparred everybody's bar with</v>

701
00:32:17.321 --> 00:32:19.600
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People knocked people out all the time.</v>

702
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.250
<v Speaker 1>This is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So stupid.</v>

703
00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.880
<v Speaker 1>I see guys get knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean out cold,</v>

704
00:32:27.881 --> 00:32:29.980
<v Speaker 1>right hand to the chin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

705
00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:32.170
<v Speaker 1>Eyes rolled behind their head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legs give out,</v>

706
00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.950
<v Speaker 1>they bounce off the canvas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put a cold towel on him,</v>

707
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:38.560
<v Speaker 1>they put some ice on his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets out and he's like,</v>

708
00:32:38.561 --> 00:32:39.171
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

709
00:32:39.171 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to keep going?</v>

710
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's keep going.</v>

711
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.420
<v Speaker 1>Let's keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you would just unconscious you just</v>

712
00:32:44.421 --> 00:32:48.200
<v Speaker 1>unconscious five minutes ago and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to keep spar and this is crazy.</v>

713
00:32:48.201 --> 00:32:49.910
<v Speaker 1>And they let him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they let him keep spar.</v>

714
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.440
<v Speaker 1>You did it from when you were like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really young,</v>

715
00:32:51.441 --> 00:32:52.010
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

716
00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Taekwondo from when I was wide took</v>
<v Speaker 1>karate classes when I was 14,</v>

717
00:32:55.791 --> 00:33:00.791
<v Speaker 1>but when I got super serious I was 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like right at my before my</v>

718
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:04.580
<v Speaker 1>sophomore year of high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I got into it from the time I</v>

719
00:33:04.581 --> 00:33:09.140
<v Speaker 1>was in the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ninth grade as I was 14.</v>

720
00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Like that summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right after my birthday around is</v>

721
00:33:12.651 --> 00:33:17.060
<v Speaker 1>when I started getting into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was probably either 14 or just</v>

722
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:20.000
<v Speaker 1>turning 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asked like was there a point you could</v>

723
00:33:20.001 --> 00:33:24.350
<v Speaker 1>tell where people actually could be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to knock people out and give that damage</v>

724
00:33:24.351 --> 00:33:27.230
<v Speaker 1>because there may be 14 year olds could</v>
<v Speaker 1>knock you out a little time here.</v>

725
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.110
<v Speaker 1>The thing about kicks is almost anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>can knock you out.</v>

726
00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:33.440
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you think of the amount of</v>

727
00:33:33.441 --> 00:33:37.040
<v Speaker 1>power that you have to have in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>

728
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:40.970
<v Speaker 1>Let's say if you decide to put a heavy</v>
<v Speaker 1>backpack on like one of those</v>

729
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.720
<v Speaker 1>outdoorsmen atlas trainers and put 90</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds on,</v>

730
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.880
<v Speaker 1>you could walk up flights of stairs.</v>

731
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think of how much power that is in</v>

732
00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:52.640
<v Speaker 1>your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could throw your body up,</v>

733
00:33:52.641 --> 00:33:57.641
<v Speaker 1>flights of stairs for exercise just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>boost your body is whatever you way</v>

734
00:33:58.011 --> 00:33:59.150
<v Speaker 1>1:50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200,</v>

735
00:33:59.151 --> 00:34:02.990
<v Speaker 1>whatever you way your body's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>launching that through the air over and</v>

736
00:34:02.991 --> 00:34:06.740
<v Speaker 1>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're a girl that weighs 135</v>

737
00:34:06.741 --> 00:34:10.310
<v Speaker 1>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still launching 135 pounds</v>

738
00:34:10.311 --> 00:34:12.740
<v Speaker 1>through the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that girl fucking shins,</v>

739
00:34:12.741 --> 00:34:17.741
<v Speaker 1>you both hang right on your temple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes across the jaw temple area.</v>

740
00:34:18.441 --> 00:34:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Got Blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your legs are going to give out,</v>

741
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:24.380
<v Speaker 1>your brain's going to shut off if</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody hits you.</v>

742
00:34:24.381 --> 00:34:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a video of A.</v>

743
00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.810
<v Speaker 1>I think the guy was she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>

744
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it was mighty Mo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mighty mo,</v>

745
00:34:33.291 --> 00:34:38.291
<v Speaker 1>who's this huge kickboxer I believe he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was samoan and I mean just like typical</v>

746
00:34:41.031 --> 00:34:45.590
<v Speaker 1>simone dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big giant fucking powerhouse of a dude.</v>

747
00:34:45.591 --> 00:34:50.000
<v Speaker 1>And he fought his little thai guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This thai guy was 175 pounds,</v>

748
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:53.390
<v Speaker 1>so Much smaller than them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was crazy to watch and tie</v>

749
00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:55.250
<v Speaker 1>guys just we went away and moving away</v>
<v Speaker 1>and moving away.</v>

750
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:58.190
<v Speaker 1>And then the thai guy roundhouse kicks</v>
<v Speaker 1>hiM in the head.</v>

751
00:34:58.191 --> 00:35:00.590
<v Speaker 1>This guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the difference in size.</v>

752
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And watch this.</v>

753
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.850
<v Speaker 1>This dude just comes over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the difference between the two of</v>

754
00:35:07.851 --> 00:35:11.900
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mighty mo is a beast to seriously</v>

755
00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:14.960
<v Speaker 1>dangerous knockout puncher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put a lot of guys to sleep,</v>

756
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.560
<v Speaker 1>so not as this guy in there with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>way bigger than him,</v>

757
00:35:18.561 --> 00:35:22.770
<v Speaker 1>but he's in there with a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look at that one head kick and</v>

758
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:26.600
<v Speaker 1>mighty most down and out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The back that up again because that is a</v>

759
00:35:26.601 --> 00:35:29.230
<v Speaker 1>crazy thing to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about a guy who might</v>

760
00:35:29.231 --> 00:35:32.760
<v Speaker 1>have been a hundred pounds lighter than</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and mighty mole.</v>

761
00:35:32.761 --> 00:35:35.570
<v Speaker 1>It's just a vicious puncher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>

762
00:35:35.571 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 1>You just clanged them right in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm talking about.</v>

763
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that to you?</v>

764
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Night night son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking more like 2:10 year olds</v>

765
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:43.800
<v Speaker 1>like no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knock each other out.</v>

766
00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:48.090
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point because the thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>process is that if you teach kids</v>

767
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.740
<v Speaker 1>technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't teach them.</v>

768
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:52.890
<v Speaker 1>They just go in these wild fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>haymaker exchanges,</v>

769
00:35:52.891 --> 00:35:56.430
<v Speaker 1>but teach them how to do it correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to do it when they're young</v>

770
00:35:56.431 --> 00:35:58.800
<v Speaker 1>because they don't hurt each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have little tiny arms and</v>

771
00:35:58.801 --> 00:36:01.950
<v Speaker 1>they just kind of touch each other and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't really generate knockout</v>

772
00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:03.150
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just sort of.</v>

773
00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.780
<v Speaker 1>If they learn how to do that from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning and then develop knockout</v>

774
00:36:06.781 --> 00:36:11.340
<v Speaker 1>power and the pads and on the bag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you develop much more technically</v>

775
00:36:11.341 --> 00:36:13.620
<v Speaker 1>proficient fighters rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>brawlers.</v>

776
00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:18.600
<v Speaker 1>So the problem with fighting is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people don't fight to the physical</v>

777
00:36:18.601 --> 00:36:20.500
<v Speaker 1>ability of their body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

778
00:36:20.501 --> 00:36:24.210
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they decide they're going to knock thiS</v>

779
00:36:24.211 --> 00:36:25.850
<v Speaker 1>guy out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna try to hit him with this and</v>

780
00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:28.590
<v Speaker 1>they think in this real limited sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>linear,</v>

781
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.800
<v Speaker 1>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like almost obvious manner.</v>

782
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
<v Speaker 1>and then you got guys who see past that</v>
<v Speaker 1>who take thIngs to a new place.</v>

783
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:40.740
<v Speaker 1>You got guys who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who figure out that you can be like</v>

784
00:36:40.741 --> 00:36:45.741
<v Speaker 1>really elusive and confusing and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see those guys fight like limited</v>

785
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:50.220
<v Speaker 1>blocky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like obvious fighters.</v>

786
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:54.360
<v Speaker 1>and like anderson silva and his prime is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a perfect example that anderson was an</v>

787
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:55.950
<v Speaker 1>artist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he would just,</v>

788
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:57.550
<v Speaker 1>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know what he was going to do.</v>

789
00:36:57.551 --> 00:36:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Its study you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be moving around,</v>

790
00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:02.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe be standing in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be dancing.</v>

791
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:05.640
<v Speaker 1>He just be following you around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden he just say,</v>

792
00:37:05.641 --> 00:37:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I got this motherfucker figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would just move in on your bank and</v>

793
00:37:09.541 --> 00:37:11.370
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know what was coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flying knee.</v>

794
00:37:11.371 --> 00:37:14.280
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know what was coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roundhouse kick front kick to the face.</v>

795
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:16.080
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know what the fuck was coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

796
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:18.030
<v Speaker 1>It was a totally different kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter,</v>

797
00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:22.890
<v Speaker 1>so the difference between that and a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just like a powerhouse of a person</v>

798
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.620
<v Speaker 1>and can knock guys out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never,</v>

799
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:30.210
<v Speaker 1>never achieves this sort of mastery of</v>
<v Speaker 1>space and distance.</v>

800
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:35.360
<v Speaker 1>They win fights through brawling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>power and just kinetic brute force</v>

801
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:40.590
<v Speaker 1>rather than artistry and avoidance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>countering like conor mcgregor,</v>

802
00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:42.960
<v Speaker 1>one knocked out josé aldo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example.</v>

803
00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.890
<v Speaker 1>All those like fuck you charge and</v>
<v Speaker 1>connor slides back,</v>

804
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.560
<v Speaker 1>bop drops a fucking left hand on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>button,</v>

805
00:37:49.561 --> 00:37:52.140
<v Speaker 1>pop up and he's the champ champ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

806
00:37:52.141 --> 00:37:54.750
<v Speaker 1>come on champ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then became the champ champ champion</v>

807
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:56.760
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

808
00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing is,</v>

809
00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:02.570
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes guys just decided to it rather</v>

810
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:05.870
<v Speaker 1>bite down your mouthpiece and let the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking chips flying.</v>

811
00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun as part of that and have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight just like the last 30 seconds,</v>

812
00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:12.750
<v Speaker 1>30 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just throw it out like crazy</v>

813
00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.490
<v Speaker 1>because they know there's no more time</v>
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

814
00:38:14.491 --> 00:38:15.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just try to.</v>

815
00:38:15.301 --> 00:38:17.640
<v Speaker 1>When I try to try to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

816
00:38:17.641 --> 00:38:18.720
<v Speaker 1>some of those fights are awesome.</v>

817
00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Look as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a person watching those things are</v>

818
00:38:21.421 --> 00:38:23.550
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two different parts.</v>

819
00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.700
<v Speaker 1>The way I look at fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I love a good diego sanchez,</v>

820
00:38:26.701 --> 00:38:30.870
<v Speaker 1>gilbert melendez fight where they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking go crazy for three rounds.</v>

821
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I loved that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ThAt was one of my favorite fights ever,</v>

822
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.900
<v Speaker 1>but I also love real technical fights</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I see,</v>

823
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:42.130
<v Speaker 1>I see like two artists trying to solve</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other's riddle,</v>

824
00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure each other out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

825
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.470
<v Speaker 1>like luke rockhold versus yoel romero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that like yolo?</v>

826
00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Just trying to figure him out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure him out.</v>

827
00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I move like this and then boom</v>
<v Speaker 1>drops that left hand on them.</v>

828
00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with him versus chris</v>
<v Speaker 1>weidman.</v>

829
00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.690
<v Speaker 1>He just moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to figure out what he's going</v>

830
00:39:00.691 --> 00:39:03.010
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hard to figure out what's coming and</v>

831
00:39:03.011 --> 00:39:06.130
<v Speaker 1>then wome flying knee To the chin or to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head.</v>

832
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:09.300
<v Speaker 1>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great example of a guy just</v>

833
00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:12.760
<v Speaker 1>figures out how to break your rhythm and</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure it through rather than just</v>

834
00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:14.770
<v Speaker 1>running a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because clash,</v>

835
00:39:14.771 --> 00:39:15.970
<v Speaker 1>clash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clash.</v>

836
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frank mir was jusT talking about that</v>

837
00:39:18.671 --> 00:39:22.210
<v Speaker 1>fate or fight and he was saying That his</v>
<v Speaker 1>ego got the best of them.</v>

838
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the fight?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>

839
00:39:24.401 --> 00:39:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Fight really crazy until feta or keto</v>
<v Speaker 1>them fade or cut on with the lefthand</v>

840
00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:31.990
<v Speaker 1>and dropped it and put them away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before fate or k owed him,</v>

841
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:37.120
<v Speaker 1>frank mir had hit fate or and it got</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting in the very beginning</v>

842
00:39:37.121 --> 00:39:39.340
<v Speaker 1>seconds of the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then fate or hit him with a</v>

843
00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.120
<v Speaker 1>perfectly timed hip throw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fucking boom.</v>

844
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:46.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean sent him flying through the air</v>
<v Speaker 1>and slammed him to the ground.</v>

845
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:50.080
<v Speaker 1>And apparently frank said from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment on his ego got the best of me</v>

846
00:39:50.081 --> 00:39:53.710
<v Speaker 1>trying to get them back and then he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wound up just getting this crazy brawl</v>

847
00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.820
<v Speaker 1>and getting knocked out.</v>

848
00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:58.930
<v Speaker 1>It's really fighting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's so interesting.</v>

849
00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:00.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just so interesting when you see</v>

850
00:40:00.881 --> 00:40:03.850
<v Speaker 1>all the different things that people can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do and how they're going to match up</v>

851
00:40:03.851 --> 00:40:06.220
<v Speaker 1>together and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what one person's going to be able to</v>

852
00:40:06.221 --> 00:40:10.060
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to get their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ideas through my ideas.</v>

853
00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I want to kick this motherfucker in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

854
00:40:11.411 --> 00:40:13.030
<v Speaker 1>How can I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got to figure out how to get there</v>

855
00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:15.220
<v Speaker 1>and his ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to take this guy down and punch</v>

856
00:40:15.221 --> 00:40:17.620
<v Speaker 1>his fucking face in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I figure out how to do this?</v>

857
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.740
<v Speaker 1>And then the two of them are just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying each other's strat and you don't</v>

858
00:40:20.741 --> 00:40:22.150
<v Speaker 1>really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't fucking know.</v>

859
00:40:22.151 --> 00:40:23.920
<v Speaker 1>You don't know until they get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the most part</v>

860
00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.373
<v Speaker 1>its greatest shit ever.</v>

861
00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Have they with the judging?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have they ever tried like I'm sharing in</v>

862
00:40:31.711 --> 00:40:34.360
<v Speaker 2>between rounds what the scores are so</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to guess it was through</v>

863
00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:37.130
<v Speaker 2>rocks that those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if they don't say who it is or they</v>

864
00:40:37.131 --> 00:40:40.500
<v Speaker 2>don't have to be a bad idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They killed them all just by being</v>

865
00:40:40.501 --> 00:40:41.820
<v Speaker 2>associated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if they weren't there?</v>

866
00:40:41.821 --> 00:40:43.560
<v Speaker 2>What if they're like in the back room or</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

867
00:40:43.561 --> 00:40:45.110
<v Speaker 2>that's even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why aren't you there?</v>

868
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.710
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the judging would be better if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were there.</v>

869
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:52.740
<v Speaker 2>They have to be there</v>
<v Speaker 2>in person judging.</v>

870
00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.010
<v Speaker 2>They're actually elevated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're a little higher than everybody</v>

871
00:40:56.011 --> 00:40:58.260
<v Speaker 2>else too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're looking at it like above me</v>

872
00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.060
<v Speaker 2>because it would have like when there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

873
00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:01.830
<v Speaker 2>when the accident happening on the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>side of the octagon,</v>

874
00:41:01.831 --> 00:41:03.990
<v Speaker 2>you can't see anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I know they didn't get a monitor,</v>

875
00:41:03.991 --> 00:41:06.250
<v Speaker 2>but like if they should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the point being we can't.</v>

876
00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.480
<v Speaker 2>We gotta make sure they got monitors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't get monitors in the</v>

877
00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.770
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the olden days they didn't have</v>

878
00:41:10.771 --> 00:41:12.600
<v Speaker 2>monitors and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going crazy.</v>

879
00:41:12.601 --> 00:41:14.720
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is it that I,</v>

880
00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:18.000
<v Speaker 2>a person who has no effect whatsoever on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the score of this fight?</v>

881
00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:20.370
<v Speaker 2>I have a monitor I can ask for for</v>
<v Speaker 2>replay.</v>

882
00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:22.180
<v Speaker 1>I have all this shit at my disposal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

883
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:25.080
<v Speaker 1>I have earphones on with a microphone</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I could press the truck.</v>

884
00:41:25.081 --> 00:41:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I see that again?</v>

885
00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:28.440
<v Speaker 1>And they'll show it to me on the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>LIke guys,</v>

886
00:41:28.441 --> 00:41:31.980
<v Speaker 1>his ankle broke and so the production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sometimes during a fight we'll tell</v>

887
00:41:31.981 --> 00:41:32.761
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey joe,</v>

888
00:41:32.761 --> 00:41:34.760
<v Speaker 1>we got head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a head but that caused that</v>

889
00:41:34.761 --> 00:41:36.140
<v Speaker 1>cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll say,</v>

890
00:41:36.141 --> 00:41:37.670
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just hearing from the truck now that</v>

891
00:41:37.671 --> 00:41:39.320
<v Speaker 1>it was a head button.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to show you that as soon as</v>

892
00:41:39.321 --> 00:41:41.240
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm watching it on the screen right</v>

893
00:41:41.241 --> 00:41:43.580
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't the judges get that?</v>

894
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.020
<v Speaker 1>How long ago did that change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like they should have been in</v>

895
00:41:46.021 --> 00:41:48.140
<v Speaker 1>table one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't that long ago.</v>

896
00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the judges have access to</v>

897
00:41:49.941 --> 00:41:52.730
<v Speaker 1>replays though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't call up a replay like I can.</v>

898
00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:54.220
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They shouldn't be able to.</v>

899
00:41:54.221 --> 00:41:57.190
<v Speaker 4>Should be able to have a little bit too</v>
<v Speaker 4>much time to judge or think about it or</v>

900
00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to know things.</v>

901
00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:00.790
<v Speaker 1>You need to know things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if a guy gets kicked in the balls,</v>

902
00:42:00.791 --> 00:42:01.780
<v Speaker 1>was that a real kick in the balls?</v>

903
00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:05.030
<v Speaker 4>Watch after the after the fact because I</v>
<v Speaker 4>just said you don't want their attention</v>

904
00:42:05.031 --> 00:42:08.390
<v Speaker 4>taken from what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The action depends on replay.</v>

905
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

906
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:13.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it should just be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>option for something's up.</v>

907
00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Like what happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he get rocked or did he fall on his</v>

908
00:42:17.391 --> 00:42:18.740
<v Speaker 1>ankle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

909
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Like what happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's only one way to tell.</v>

910
00:42:21.531 --> 00:42:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you got to see it again</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he that again,</v>

911
00:42:23.511 --> 00:42:24.530
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be able to say,</v>

912
00:42:24.531 --> 00:42:25.460
<v Speaker 1>can I see that again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please?</v>

913
00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.110
<v Speaker 1>That would be as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

914
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Well they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have instant replays now,</v>

915
00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.000
<v Speaker 1>which is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say if a guy pokes the guy in the</v>

916
00:42:32.001 --> 00:42:34.460
<v Speaker 1>eye and the judge wants to call for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>instant replay,</v>

917
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:38.960
<v Speaker 1>but once they instituted the instant</v>
<v Speaker 1>replay in some states the fight is over.</v>

918
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.540
<v Speaker 1>That's so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

919
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.820
<v Speaker 1>So if I say no instant replay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just take this.</v>

920
00:42:43.821 --> 00:42:45.770
<v Speaker 1>I poke and keep fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay,</v>

921
00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:49.220
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to look at it on video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fights over what?</v>

922
00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.050
<v Speaker 4>I compare it to the mba,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I watch a lot,</v>

923
00:42:52.051 --> 00:42:54.540
<v Speaker 4>they go to the replay a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a little annoying as a viewer,</v>

924
00:42:54.541 --> 00:42:56.340
<v Speaker 4>but they're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to get it right,</v>

925
00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:00.280
<v Speaker 4>which they have a team of people in New</v>
<v Speaker 4>York where they're watching all the.</v>

926
00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:02.370
<v Speaker 4>All the angles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can pull up anything they want.</v>

927
00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.010
<v Speaker 4>They can see anything that they take as</v>
<v Speaker 4>much time as they need to.</v>

928
00:43:05.011 --> 00:43:07.620
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it takes five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but why not do that with fighting?</v>

929
00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:08.513
<v Speaker 4>They get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

930
00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:10.950
<v Speaker 4>Common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why doesn't that exist?</v>

931
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:14.650
<v Speaker 1>It should definitely exist and I mean we</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about it with Michael Chandler</v>

932
00:43:14.651 --> 00:43:15.760
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There should be more.</v>

933
00:43:15.761 --> 00:43:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Judges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely shouldn't be.</v>

934
00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Only three judges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

935
00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:20.290
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

936
00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:22.120
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to limit it to three</v>
<v Speaker 1>judges.</v>

937
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:27.510
<v Speaker 1>I bet you would get far more competent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far more knowledgeable judges for free</v>

938
00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:32.410
<v Speaker 1>than you would even if you paid them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pull up their fucking twitter cap,</v>

939
00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.200
<v Speaker 1>blow the twitter account up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll judge you for free to so many</v>

940
00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:38.620
<v Speaker 1>mma fans out there that would love to</v>
<v Speaker 1>judge fights and they actually</v>

941
00:43:38.621 --> 00:43:41.380
<v Speaker 1>understand fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really get it and they love it.</v>

942
00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:45.070
<v Speaker 1>They're not just doing it because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>job and they used to do boxing and you</v>

943
00:43:45.071 --> 00:43:48.490
<v Speaker 1>know this is a good way to make 1500</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks on a saturday night or whatever</v>

944
00:43:48.491 --> 00:43:50.920
<v Speaker 1>they met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what they're doing it because</v>

945
00:43:50.921 --> 00:43:51.760
<v Speaker 1>they actually love it.</v>

946
00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.530
<v Speaker 1>So many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do it.</v>

947
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:57.290
<v Speaker 1>It will be way better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can definitely judge from home too.</v>

948
00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:01.510
<v Speaker 1>We could definitely should have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean why not have like an online</v>

949
00:44:01.511 --> 00:44:05.770
<v Speaker 1>scorecard as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why not have that as an option so</v>

950
00:44:05.771 --> 00:44:08.560
<v Speaker 1>the ufc could let everybody know how bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>the judges are.</v>

951
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:13.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not saying that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>online is going to know what the fuck</v>

952
00:44:13.871 --> 00:44:16.430
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but enough people online you going to</v>

953
00:44:16.431 --> 00:44:18.190
<v Speaker 1>know what they're talking about where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll balance out.</v>

954
00:44:18.490 --> 00:44:23.490
<v Speaker 1>So if you had just like 10 judges and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the online judges have an online</v>

955
00:44:25.081 --> 00:44:25.300
<v Speaker 1>store</v>

956
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.150
<v Speaker 4>work card.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you pay for five pasture where you</v>

957
00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:29.830
<v Speaker 4>probably are willing to have some</v>
<v Speaker 4>knowledge on the sport,</v>

958
00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:32.210
<v Speaker 4>but also it put it in the app.</v>

959
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.450
<v Speaker 3>Say like conor fight unknown ob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

960
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.470
<v Speaker 3>they're all the conor fans are going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>vote for him anyway.</v>

961
00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:41.580
<v Speaker 3>Balance out because unknown bob will</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably have some fans too and then</v>

962
00:44:41.581 --> 00:44:45.000
<v Speaker 3>people will be a bunch of haters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're hoping that connor failed</v>

963
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.390
<v Speaker 3>because he's got a limousine and bypass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got paid for your vote.</v>

964
00:44:48.391 --> 00:44:50.250
<v Speaker 3>In that case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to pay 10 bucks every time.</v>

965
00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:51.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

966
00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:53.640
<v Speaker 3>Will you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had an app,</v>

967
00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.730
<v Speaker 3>you have a ufc app and the app,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all it has to do,</v>

968
00:44:56.731 --> 00:44:59.790
<v Speaker 3>they just make it so it's interactive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So with each fight,</v>

969
00:44:59.791 --> 00:45:02.520
<v Speaker 3>after the fights over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you click winner or loser,</v>

970
00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.340
<v Speaker 3>you know that's all you have to do just</v>
<v Speaker 3>quick winter and you.</v>

971
00:45:05.341 --> 00:45:07.620
<v Speaker 3>If you are optional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could put in your own score,</v>

972
00:45:07.621 --> 00:45:10.140
<v Speaker 3>but the fuck out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scoring sucks anyway.</v>

973
00:45:10.141 --> 00:45:12.480
<v Speaker 3>That 10 point must system stupid.</v>

974
00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:14.880
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a borrowed system.</v>

975
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:17.160
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good system for all those</v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons.</v>

976
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:19.200
<v Speaker 3>It's a good system for two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two weapons,</v>

977
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:23.280
<v Speaker 3>punches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kicks and knees and elbows,</v>

978
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.440
<v Speaker 3>chokes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>takedowns defense.</v>

979
00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:30.770
<v Speaker 3>You've got slams and throws and come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll kicks and spinning back kick.</v>

980
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:34.170
<v Speaker 3>What's better?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spinning back kick or a jab</v>

981
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.210
<v Speaker 3>in boxing is a punch or a punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that punch was harder than that</v>

982
00:45:39.211 --> 00:45:41.670
<v Speaker 3>punch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but unless someone's kicking you in the</v>

983
00:45:41.671 --> 00:45:42.930
<v Speaker 3>leg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't even know what that feels</v>

984
00:45:42.931 --> 00:45:43.920
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have no idea.</v>

985
00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:45.810
<v Speaker 3>Guys just walking around like nothing</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

986
00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.450
<v Speaker 3>You can't score that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If nobody's ever kicked you in the legs,</v>

987
00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:53.690
<v Speaker 3>they should have a full body suit that</v>
<v Speaker 3>detects punches and that like how strong</v>

988
00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:57.330
<v Speaker 3>it is within.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes away from the fucking.</v>

989
00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:00.220
<v Speaker 3>The rawness of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't have people fighting in body</v>

990
00:46:00.221 --> 00:46:01.260
<v Speaker 3>suits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the future.</v>

991
00:46:01.261 --> 00:46:02.790
<v Speaker 3>It will look like you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything on.</v>

992
00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:06.840
<v Speaker 3>A lot of gals have to where the weather</v>
<v Speaker 3>is something that covers their</v>

993
00:46:06.841 --> 00:46:08.280
<v Speaker 3>midsection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

994
00:46:08.281 --> 00:46:12.780
<v Speaker 3>They have like a sports bra strap down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of jammy and they wear something</v>

995
00:46:12.781 --> 00:46:15.090
<v Speaker 3>that covers her midsection to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

996
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:18.180
<v Speaker 3>Like they have to have their stomach</v>
<v Speaker 3>covered or they're allowed to have their</v>

997
00:46:18.181 --> 00:46:23.181
<v Speaker 3>stomach covered just to keep their boobs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and check like everybody got to stay in</v>

998
00:46:23.491 --> 00:46:25.380
<v Speaker 3>the party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't fuck up those titties.</v>

999
00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:26.760
<v Speaker 3>Cats and gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll be on soon.</v>

1000
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:30.210
<v Speaker 3>She'll explain it to us because she had</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wardrobe malfunction.</v>

1001
00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:34.850
<v Speaker 3>One of her fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really just a little snip at the docs</v>

1002
00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:38.340
<v Speaker 3>can</v>
<v Speaker 3>skip steps</v>

1003
00:46:40.770 --> 00:46:44.040
<v Speaker 3>in that funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every dude shows his nipple every due to</v>

1004
00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:46.500
<v Speaker 3>fights shows his nipple girl goes out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shows her nipple.</v>

1005
00:46:46.501 --> 00:46:48.270
<v Speaker 3>Everybody goes crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny.</v>

1006
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:51.720
<v Speaker 3>Twitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitch won't even let a grown man take</v>

1007
00:46:51.721 --> 00:46:54.920
<v Speaker 3>off his shirt stand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keep your clothes on.</v>

1008
00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.030
<v Speaker 3>You freak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are always like,</v>

1009
00:46:57.031 --> 00:46:58.860
<v Speaker 3>why don't you broadcast on twitch?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I,</v>

1010
00:46:58.861 --> 00:47:00.990
<v Speaker 3>if I can get banned for just showing a</v>
<v Speaker 3>nipple.</v>

1011
00:47:00.991 --> 00:47:01.740
<v Speaker 3>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1012
00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:04.290
<v Speaker 3>anything a man can get banned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like bert kreischer,</v>

1013
00:47:04.291 --> 00:47:06.860
<v Speaker 3>if he tried to do the berg cast on</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitch,</v>

1014
00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:10.800
<v Speaker 3>which it immediately be a band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could maybe talk to them and they</v>

1015
00:47:10.801 --> 00:47:12.060
<v Speaker 3>might be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But most people,</v>

1016
00:47:12.061 --> 00:47:14.450
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's against the guidelines to show skin</v>

1017
00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:18.180
<v Speaker 3>looks a lot of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the only problem with twitter</v>

1018
00:47:18.181 --> 00:47:19.710
<v Speaker 3>that you forget.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's made for babies.</v>

1019
00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:24.180
<v Speaker 3>So silly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't show man boobs.</v>

1020
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:25.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty readable.</v>

1021
00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.830
<v Speaker 3>You're super flat chested with you take</v>
<v Speaker 3>your shirt off and you just smooth.</v>

1022
00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:32.170
<v Speaker 3>I just don't want people taking their</v>
<v Speaker 3>shirts off there.</v>

1023
00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.700
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if you take your shirt off and you</v>

1024
00:47:33.701 --> 00:47:34.690
<v Speaker 3>have like pastries on.</v>

1025
00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:39.720
<v Speaker 5>I do have people that do body paint,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there is a little bit of</v>

1026
00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.450
<v Speaker 3>body paints.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1027
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:45.650
<v Speaker 3>So if you decide to do like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1028
00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:49.470
<v Speaker 3>the british flag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>paint that over your body,</v>

1029
00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:52.700
<v Speaker 3>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you just can't be no paint</v>

1030
00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.150
<v Speaker 5>strip clubs in columbus,</v>

<v Speaker 5>will paint her eyes like up here and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then have like a fake nose and a fake</v>

1050
00:48:43.961 --> 00:48:46.780
<v Speaker 5>mouth and it looks like a completely</v>
<v Speaker 5>different face and then she opens her</v>

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:48.100
<v Speaker 5>realize you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well that's that.</v>

1052
00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:50.830
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>
<v Speaker 3>her name though.</v>

1053
00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is basically you're looking at</v>

1054
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:56.140
<v Speaker 3>naked boobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just got paint on them.</v>

1055
00:48:56.141 --> 00:48:58.780
<v Speaker 3>So we let it slide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is this this girl's thing?</v>

1056
00:48:58.781 --> 00:49:00.770
<v Speaker 3>She just gets her boobs painted and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes onto.</v>

1057
00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:01.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she does.</v>

1058
00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.210
<v Speaker 3>That's her thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is hilarious.</v>

1059
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.880
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a way that you could see the</v>

1060
00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:08.680
<v Speaker 3>whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Girls are trying to figure out this</v>

1061
00:49:08.681 --> 00:49:10.510
<v Speaker 3>dress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just not tight enough.</v>

1062
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:12.040
<v Speaker 3>It's not revealing enough.</v>

1063
00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:15.540
<v Speaker 5>There were some girls that were playing</v>
<v Speaker 5>games on twitch just in like a bikini or</v>

1064
00:49:15.541 --> 00:49:17.070
<v Speaker 5>whatnot and they got in trouble for</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

1065
00:49:17.071 --> 00:49:19.980
<v Speaker 5>So they hAd to take their scheme over to</v>
<v Speaker 5>youtube or some other sites.</v>

1066
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:25.190
<v Speaker 3>How long before someone comes up with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>nontoxic paint that girls can paint all</v>

1067
00:49:25.191 --> 00:49:29.360
<v Speaker 3>over their body and it's like a thin</v>
<v Speaker 3>nylon layer and they'll go ouT and</v>

1068
00:49:29.361 --> 00:49:32.060
<v Speaker 3>you'll see everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know there's going to be a few</v>

1069
00:49:32.061 --> 00:49:35.030
<v Speaker 3>girls that just go for it.</v>

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.940
<v Speaker 5>Like for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like parts of africa that aren't online</v>

1115
00:51:28.941 --> 00:51:32.780
<v Speaker 5>now will be online eventually that the</v>
<v Speaker 5>scams will switch back.</v>

1116
00:51:32.781 --> 00:51:36.050
<v Speaker 5>Like the nigerian prince scam will be</v>
<v Speaker 5>american scamming.</v>

1117
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:39.710
<v Speaker 5>People in africa just get on because</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't know about the scams yet</v>

1118
00:51:39.711 --> 00:51:40.670
<v Speaker 5>because they haven't been a part of it.</v>

1119
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that really happened</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like some theories,</v>

1121
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:47.480
<v Speaker 1>that's not a bad theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those people were really good at</v>

1122
00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:51.530
<v Speaker 1>scamming lonely people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was such a sad show I was watching</v>

1123
00:51:51.531 --> 00:51:54.820
<v Speaker 1>once about this old guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the guy's daughter was like</v>

1124
00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:58.910
<v Speaker 1>trying to like tell him that this girl</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't real and he kept going to england</v>

1125
00:51:58.911 --> 00:52:00.920
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to europe twice,</v>

1126
00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to meet her and both times something</v>

1127
00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:06.740
<v Speaker 1>came up and she couldn't meet him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he went back again and he keeps</v>

1128
00:52:06.741 --> 00:52:09.260
<v Speaker 1>sending her money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been sending her money,</v>

1129
00:52:09.261 --> 00:52:11.180
<v Speaker 1>sent her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say like a quarter million</v>

1130

1131
00:52:14.661 --> 00:52:16.160

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:19.940
<v Speaker 1>like they're filming them and talking to</v>

<v Speaker 1>but thinking they might be right.</v>

1134
00:52:22.371 --> 00:52:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Like he was going insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was going insane from loneliness.</v>

1135
00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:28.570

1145
00:52:56.621 --> 00:53:00.070
<v Speaker 1>I caught a coYote in my yard last night</v>
<v Speaker 1>was predatory behavior,</v>

1146
00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.080
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to have human coyotes.</v>

1147
00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.150
<v Speaker 1>You're Always going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't catch him,</v>

1148
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:05.470
<v Speaker 1>catch him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch him.</v>

1149
00:53:05.471 --> 00:53:08.110
<v Speaker 1>I just chased them out of my yard to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get my chickens.</v>

1150
00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:12.820
<v Speaker 1>But this is a predatory behavior on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>weak person,</v>

1151
00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:18.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I can see it's on one hand I feel</v>

1152
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:20.640
<v Speaker 1>upset that they would go after these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1153
00:53:20.641 --> 00:53:23.470
<v Speaker 1>these lonely people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand that's fascinating</v>

1154
00:53:23.471 --> 00:53:28.471
<v Speaker 1>to me was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a drug people's love is what a drug</v>

1155
00:53:29.041 --> 00:53:34.041
<v Speaker 1>that is like how important it is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like find people that care about</v>

1156
00:53:35.641 --> 00:53:37.440
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that like them and care about them.</v>

1157
00:53:37.441 --> 00:53:40.440
<v Speaker 1>IT's so important when you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in your life,</v>

1158
00:53:40.441 --> 00:53:45.441

<v Speaker 1>probably the most major sources of like</v>

1159
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:52.260
<v Speaker 1>bad feelings in people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they just don't have anybody that</v>

1160
00:53:52.261 --> 00:53:54.720
<v Speaker 1>loves them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't get what good friends,</v>

1162
00:53:57.901 --> 00:54:01.860
<v Speaker 1>and they just sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sad to the point where someone</v>

<v Speaker 1>especially grinder now that backpage has</v>
<v Speaker 1>closed,</v>

1237
00:57:47.201 --> 00:57:50.110
<v Speaker 1>like all these websites are closing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting to see what</v>

1238
00:57:50.111 --> 00:57:53.460
<v Speaker 1>happens next where people are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find their hookups and stuff.</v>

1239
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1240
00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:58.690
<v Speaker 1>That was what I was reading this thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>where sex workers are in danger because</v>

1241
00:57:58.691 --> 00:58:00.850
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because before they used to be able to</v>

1242
00:58:00.851 --> 00:58:05.851
<v Speaker 1>vet customers and then customers would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have like a record of using other sex</v>

1243
00:58:06.701 --> 00:58:09.640
<v Speaker 1>workers and they could know who the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychos were,</v>

1244
00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:11.320
<v Speaker 1>who to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1245
00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:16.980
<v Speaker 1>And they could also screened people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>actively screen.</v>

1246
00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:18.460
<v Speaker 1>They could do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could do all this.</v>

1247
00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.590
<v Speaker 1>they were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading an article about it where</v>

1248
00:58:20.591 --> 00:58:24.010
<v Speaker 1>this girl who remember if they gave her</v>
<v Speaker 1>name out or not,</v>

1249
00:58:24.011 --> 00:58:26.560
<v Speaker 1>but she was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She worked in a brothel and she was</v>

1250
00:58:26.561 --> 00:58:30.300
<v Speaker 1>talking about it and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1251
00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Why are they doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is there,</v>

1252
00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:35.050
<v Speaker 1>is it because of a crime?</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the crime?</v>

1253
00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:38.080
<v Speaker 1>So if they get together like through</v>
<v Speaker 1>tinder or grindr,</v>

1254
00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:42.130
<v Speaker 1>that's fine because that's two people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that decided to have sex,</v>

1255
00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:46.330
<v Speaker 1>but as long as they're grown adults and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one person just wants to get paid and</v>

1256
00:58:46.331 --> 00:58:47.800
<v Speaker 1>the other person's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'll pay you.</v>

1257
00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:49.030
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1258
00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.210
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

1259
00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Why is that illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're not talking about sex</v>

1260
00:58:53.231 --> 00:58:56.770
<v Speaker 1>trafficking for children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about slavery.</v>

1261
00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Were just talking about just let's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it from the cleanest</v>

1262
00:58:59.801 --> 00:59:03.340
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Possible grown adult who likes sex,</v>

1263
00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:06.910
<v Speaker 1>decides she wants to work in a brothel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>

1264
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible for you to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for it to be a grown adult who</v>

1265
00:59:10.541 --> 00:59:13.540
<v Speaker 1>actually enjoys it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does have any problem with it decides</v>

1266
00:59:13.541 --> 00:59:14.860
<v Speaker 1>that it's better than working at</v>
<v Speaker 1>wendy's?</v>

1267
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible?</v>

1268
00:59:17.561 --> 00:59:19.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people don't want to say it.</v>

1269
00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to say that it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to ever look at it that</v>

1270
00:59:22.461 --> 00:59:25.280
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The war on sex workers needs to stop</v>

1271
00:59:25.281 --> 00:59:26.180
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rolling stone.</v>

1272
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:27.463
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1273
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:35.230
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like a dumb thing to chase</v>

1274
00:59:35.231 --> 00:59:37.750
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1275
00:59:37.751 --> 00:59:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I think if people want to have sex with</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

1276
00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:43.630
<v Speaker 1>nobody has a problem with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if people want to pay people to have</v>

1277
00:59:43.631 --> 00:59:45.370
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's a problem.</v>

1278
00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:49.270
<v Speaker 1>That seems so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1279
00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:53.740
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about child slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about sex slaves.</v>

1280
00:59:53.741 --> 00:59:55.960
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about anything against</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody's will.</v>

1281
00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.540
<v Speaker 1>We're just talking about people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>would choose to do that.</v>

1282
00:59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Like why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've always used this example,</v>

1283
01:00:01.781 --> 01:00:02.920
<v Speaker 1>but it's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1284
01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Why is it okay for me to get a massage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay for me to pay someone to give</v>

1285
01:00:07.481 --> 01:00:10.450
<v Speaker 1>me pleasure all over my body except my</v>
<v Speaker 1>genitals.</v>

1286
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Like they could ruB my neck and my feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can get it all.</v>

1287
01:00:13.601 --> 01:00:14.860
<v Speaker 1>All been my feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1288
01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:16.720
<v Speaker 1>They get those thumbs and start working</v>
<v Speaker 1>your feet.</v>

1289
01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they crack your toe pop.</v>

1290
01:00:19.211 --> 01:00:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Pop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels great.</v>

1291
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:23.080
<v Speaker 1>That's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't jerk you off.</v>

1292
01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:25.480
<v Speaker 1>They jerked you off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be a terrible sin against god.</v>

1293
01:00:25.481 --> 01:00:27.940
<v Speaker 1>And man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they touched your penis,</v>

1294
01:00:27.941 --> 01:00:29.530
<v Speaker 1>which feels really good when you touch</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1295
01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:33.460
<v Speaker 1>can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a dude who said he gets asked</v>

1296
01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:35.350
<v Speaker 1>whole massages.</v>

1297
01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:38.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That actually happens all the time to be</v>

1298
01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.220
<v Speaker 5>terrier of your asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They massage the interior of your</v>

1299
01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:45.610
<v Speaker 5>asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's okay because it's just a massage.</v>

1300
01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:49.010
<v Speaker 5>Prostate massage with weird is when they</v>
<v Speaker 5>do it and they don't ask you because</v>

1301
01:00:49.011 --> 01:00:50.950
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of massage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People just do it.</v>

1302
01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:52.900
<v Speaker 5>That's a part of the massage and they</v>
<v Speaker 5>just started.</v>

1306
01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Apparently some people get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they use a tool and they</v>

1307

<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I doing?</v>

1327
01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:49.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a sphincter massage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very important to release some of</v>

1328
01:01:49.871 --> 01:01:51.790
<v Speaker 1>the shock rose and negative energy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1329
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>and some of the toxins that are stored</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your body from processed foods and a</v>

1330
01:01:55.930 --> 01:01:58.120
<v Speaker 1>modern lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're just going into your asshole.</v>

1331
01:01:58.121 --> 01:02:02.740
<v Speaker 1>But to dump some guru talked people into</v>
<v Speaker 1>filming them in the ass.</v>

1332
01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:07.090
<v Speaker 5>So weird that I've never.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I just recently found out all that</v>

1333
01:02:07.091 --> 01:02:08.770
<v Speaker 5>shit that's happening in massage</v>
<v Speaker 5>parlors,</v>

1334
01:02:08.771 --> 01:02:09.580
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1335
01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:12.400
<v Speaker 5>10 years ago I had no clue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would go buy a massage part and go,</v>

1336
01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:13.630
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's of massages.</v>

1337
01:02:13.631 --> 01:02:17.410
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing bad going on here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how many places like that are</v>

1338
01:02:17.411 --> 01:02:18.400
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like psychics,</v>

1339
01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 5>what happens at psychics at four in the</v>

1340
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.210
<v Speaker 2>morning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are they open at four in the</v>

1341
01:02:21.211 --> 01:02:22.710
<v Speaker 2>morning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that where you get your ass eat</v>

1342
01:02:22.711 --> 01:02:24.570
<v Speaker 2>and out and I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't learn about that until you're</v>

1343
01:02:24.571 --> 01:02:27.150
<v Speaker 2>70 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1344
01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Think psychics are open late at night</v>
<v Speaker 2>because a,</v>

1345
01:02:31.570 --> 01:02:35.340
<v Speaker 2>it's a scam and be when people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's late at night.</v>

1346
01:02:35.341 --> 01:02:38.190
<v Speaker 2>They're drunk and like maybe it's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls driving home.</v>

1347
01:02:38.191 --> 01:02:41.550
<v Speaker 2>The guy texted her and she doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should I text him back?</v>

1348
01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:44.790
<v Speaker 2>Why is he texted me so late?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of disrespectful.</v>

1349
01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:49.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he's the one that she</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulls into that psychic's office and</v>

1350
01:02:49.531 --> 01:02:52.650
<v Speaker 2>she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just need you to tell me about my</v>

1351
01:02:52.651 --> 01:02:57.651
<v Speaker 2>future and the psychic because like I</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense there's a problem and romantic</v>

<v Speaker 1>He knew about our relationship problems</v>

1370
01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>and he knew that I was on my way over</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wondering whether or not he's the</v>

01:04:48.731 --> 01:04:51.160
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some guy in the back like looking at</v>

<v Speaker 2>super high scammy level</v>

1398
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:07.240
<v Speaker 2>because you want to repeat customer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're that accurate habit,</v>

1399
01:05:07.241 --> 01:05:10.420
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge scam that that is a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing if you're driving,</v>

1400
01:05:10.570 --> 01:05:14.440
<v Speaker 2>if you're driving to burbank or some</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit every couple miles to see one of</v>

1401
01:05:14.441 --> 01:05:18.070
<v Speaker 2>those psychic reader places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five in the morning</v>

<v Speaker 5>open big hand on the front,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a hand job place.</v>

1403
01:05:21.221 --> 01:05:22.120
<v Speaker 5>But it's a psychic.</v>

1404
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I went to one once when I was in New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York and I was going to these fucking</v>

1405
01:05:28.781 --> 01:05:32.560
<v Speaker 1>stupid auditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not want to act and I was going,</v>

1406
01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I was just wasn't what I was interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in doing,</v>

1407
01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.080
<v Speaker 1>but like your agency would tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1408
01:05:38.081 --> 01:05:39.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really should look into this and</v>

1409
01:05:39.281 --> 01:05:42.880
<v Speaker 1>you'll see what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like some role that not only was</v>

1410
01:05:42.881 --> 01:05:46.700
<v Speaker 1>I not going to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want it like this is like,</v>

1411
01:05:46.701 --> 01:05:49.000
<v Speaker 1>it's not even funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like super serious.</v>

1412
01:05:49.001 --> 01:05:49.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you should do it.</v>

1413
01:05:49.691 --> 01:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>So they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know,</v>

1414
01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>they know what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could do commercials that go in and</v>

<v Speaker 1>read for commercials and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing?</v>

1416
01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:58.990
<v Speaker 1>So I left one of them and I was terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it too.</v>

1417
01:05:58.991 --> 01:06:01.990
<v Speaker 1>It was terrible auditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I went to this,</v>

1418
01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:06.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to this psychic and I'm like,</v>

1419
01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:06.881

<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any</v>

1424
01:06:13.340 --> 01:06:17.020

<v Speaker 5>I left her,</v>

<v Speaker 5>her eyes and she looked at it,</v>

1426
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:24.330
<v Speaker 1>me and I knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knew that.</v>

1427
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:29.220
<v Speaker 1>I knew she was full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew she was full of shit.</v>

1428
01:06:29.221 --> 01:06:30.720
<v Speaker 1>I looked at her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any brothers.</v>

1429
01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:32.230
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>for the most part.</v>

<v Speaker 5>can do some shit,</v>

1437
01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:54.000
<v Speaker 5>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we still accept it.</v>

1438
01:06:54.030 --> 01:06:56.790
<v Speaker 5>People still go to it even though they</v>
<v Speaker 5>know deep down like,</v>

01:08:41.221 --> 01:08:43.700
<v Speaker 1>this is a goddamn carnival trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said to the guy,</v>

1488
01:08:43.701 --> 01:08:45.140
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the goddamn carnival trick.</v>

1489
01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:47.510
<v Speaker 1>And goldberg was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this fake?</v>

1490
01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:48.380
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fake.</v>

1491
01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:49.821
<v Speaker 1>It's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1492
01:08:49.821 --> 01:08:50.631
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1493
01:08:50.631 --> 01:08:53.090
<v Speaker 1>you tell me how this works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a piece of plastic,</v>

1494
01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:54.950
<v Speaker 1>but you're telling me I'm going to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a rubber band.</v>

1495
01:08:54.951 --> 01:08:56.630
<v Speaker 1>It's going to make me stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1496
01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't spend a lot of time in school,</v>

1497
01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:02.870
<v Speaker 1>but I spent enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

1498
01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.850
<v Speaker 5>You can't do a hologram inside a</v>
<v Speaker 5>hologram.</v>

1499
01:09:04.851 --> 01:09:06.680
<v Speaker 5>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Life is a hologram.</v>

1500
01:09:06.681 --> 01:09:08.560
<v Speaker 5>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all hog.</v>

1501
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:10.520
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't even exist.</v>

1502
01:09:10.521 --> 01:09:11.354
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

1503
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:14.970
<v Speaker 1>There's certain things that make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it might be a hologram,</v>

1504
01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Power scam.</v>

1505
01:09:16.111 --> 01:09:17.640
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Power bounce.</v>

1506
01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Admits the wristbands or scam or wait a</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

1507
01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:22.230
<v Speaker 1>No way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

1508
01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:27.210
<v Speaker 1>We admit that there's no credible</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific evidence that supports our</v>

1509
01:09:27.211 --> 01:09:30.870
<v Speaker 1>claims and therefore we engage in</v>
<v Speaker 1>misleading conduct.</v>

1510
01:09:31.410 --> 01:09:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I called that shit out in like 2001.</v>

1511
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:36.360
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you guys doing?</v>

1512
01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Like what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's wearing that?</v>

1513
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Why you weren't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you think that would work?</v>

1514
01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.950
<v Speaker 1>They had to published that in australian</v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

1515
01:09:43.951 --> 01:09:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Australia is fucking smarter</v>

1516
01:09:46.261 --> 01:09:51.150
<v Speaker 1>than us</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of their bogus claims and pseudo</v>

1517
01:09:51.151 --> 01:09:54.150
<v Speaker 1>scientific mumbo jumbo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this seems to be the first time in</v>

1518
01:09:54.151 --> 01:09:57.690
<v Speaker 1>which a regulatory authority has made</v>
<v Speaker 1>them admit their claims are simply a</v>

1519
01:09:57.691 --> 01:10:02.691
<v Speaker 1>fraud derp look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some shit that makes you strong,</v>

1520
01:10:02.791 --> 01:10:06.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a rubber band with a piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>of plastic attached to it.</v>

1521
01:10:07.100 --> 01:10:08.950
<v Speaker 1>It cbd oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1522
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:10.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want something that makes you feel</v>

1523
01:10:10.291 --> 01:10:12.650
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cbd oils real well,</v>

1524
01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:13.680
<v Speaker 1>trying to make that illegal.</v>

1525
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:16.110
<v Speaker 5>There is some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1526
01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:19.990
<v Speaker 5>some people that say that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 5>scientific proof that cbd,</v>

1527
01:10:19.991 --> 01:10:22.380
<v Speaker 5>even eggs works at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's always,</v>

1528
01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:25.360
<v Speaker 5>it's always the other ingredients that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are mixed with the cbd,</v>

1529
01:10:25.361 --> 01:10:27.670
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they'll take the same ingredients</v>

1530
01:10:27.671 --> 01:10:30.220
<v Speaker 5>that's in bengay and then put cbd in it</v>
<v Speaker 5>also.</v>

1531
01:10:30.221 --> 01:10:32.260
<v Speaker 5>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't this feel numb now?</v>

1532
01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.240
<v Speaker 5>Like there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no real.</v>

1533
01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:38.950
<v Speaker 5>I heard that there was no real concrete</v>
<v Speaker 5>evidence that cbd because there's no</v>

1534
01:10:38.951 --> 01:10:39.420
<v Speaker 5>test.</v>

1535
01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I thought there was evidence that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>decreased inflammation.</v>

1536
01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there evidence that a decreased</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation?</v>

1537
01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.120
<v Speaker 1>The problem is the scientific studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things.</v>

1538
01:10:48.230 --> 01:10:50.820
<v Speaker 1>It might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be mind fucking myself when I</v>

1539
01:10:50.821 --> 01:10:53.190
<v Speaker 1>put that stuff on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might seem to work though,</v>

1540
01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:57.930
<v Speaker 1>especially for my elbow tendinitis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it works.</v>

1541
01:10:57.931 --> 01:11:00.540
<v Speaker 1>Finally getting over dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I finally could do chin ups.</v>

1542
01:11:00.541 --> 01:11:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do champs for months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Months.</v>

1543
01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Try years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe</v>

1544
01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:08.910
<v Speaker 1>up with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll help get cBd in it.</v>

1545
01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1546
01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:11.800
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

1547
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I was not doing chin ups or anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy.</v>

1548
01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.560
<v Speaker 1>I was doing mostlY running and yoga for</v>
<v Speaker 1>months because of this fucking elbow</v>

1549
01:11:19.561 --> 01:11:22.020
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never had tendinitis before.</v>

1550
01:11:22.290 --> 01:11:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I've had muscle poles and stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>injuries.</v>

1551
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:29.270
<v Speaker 1>I never had tendinitis this and this was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dumb one because I meet,</v>

1552
01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.760
<v Speaker 1>headed my way through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need headed it into a bad place.</v>

1553
01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:34.120
<v Speaker 1>I go to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't be a pussy,</v>

1554
01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:38.640
<v Speaker 1>just keep working out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it got real bad and then it</v>

1555
01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:40.710
<v Speaker 1>until I did a bunch of different stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

1556
01:11:40.711 --> 01:11:45.711
<v Speaker 1>I did stem cells and regena keen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that helped them also</v>

1557
01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.040
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this rubber thing.</v>

1558
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:48.163
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that roller?</v>

1559
01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:49.291
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1560
01:11:49.291 --> 01:11:50.550
<v Speaker 1>It's called a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a therm.</v>

1561
01:11:50.551 --> 01:11:52.800
<v Speaker 1>a band.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've Talked about this so many times</v>

1562
01:11:52.801 --> 01:11:55.470
<v Speaker 1>that I can't therabands rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't buy them on amazon anymore.</v>

1563
01:11:55.471 --> 01:11:57.930
<v Speaker 1>People have bought them out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm glad because they work.</v>

1564
01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:59.730
<v Speaker 1>If you have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cheap too.</v>

1565
01:11:59.790 --> 01:12:02.010
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a piece of rubber and if you</v>

1566
01:12:02.011 --> 01:12:04.560
<v Speaker 1>don't have this and you have something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can do a similar exercise,</v>

1567
01:12:04.561 --> 01:12:07.290
<v Speaker 1>it'll probably help too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you do is you twist it and then</v>

1568
01:12:07.291 --> 01:12:08.124
<v Speaker 1>in the release,</v>

1569
01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:09.843
<v Speaker 9>hm.</v>

1570
01:12:10.030 --> 01:12:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1571
01:12:11.530 --> 01:12:15.480
<v Speaker 1>You twist this thing and in the elite</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like to twist it with your hand like</v>

1572
01:12:15.481 --> 01:12:17.970
<v Speaker 1>this and then the release with the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>

1573
01:12:17.971 --> 01:12:19.830
<v Speaker 1>the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My right elbow is one that was injured</v>

1574
01:12:20.130 --> 01:12:22.110
<v Speaker 1>and just slowly letting it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>

1575
01:12:22.111 --> 01:12:23.280
<v Speaker 1>This part of your arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1576
01:12:23.281 --> 01:12:25.620
<v Speaker 1>that's weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even thouGh it's injured,</v>

1577
01:12:25.621 --> 01:12:27.300
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't hurt it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it strengthens it.</v>

1578
01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:28.560
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works a lot,</v>

1579
01:12:28.561 --> 01:12:31.560
<v Speaker 1>so I'll just pick this fucker up and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it 10 times,</v>

1580
01:12:31.561 --> 01:12:34.360
<v Speaker 1>12 times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 times and do it several times a day</v>

1581
01:12:34.361 --> 01:12:37.440
<v Speaker 1>and I made a big difference man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like right away I coulD feel it just.</v>

1582
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:41.430
<v Speaker 1>It feels like everything around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like strengthened and stabilized</v>

1583
01:12:41.431 --> 01:12:45.270
<v Speaker 1>and it just started feeling better</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're putting a load on it and</v>

1584
01:12:45.271 --> 01:12:48.030
<v Speaker 1>then you make an it release the load</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of like pulling it in the</v>

1585
01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:49.800
<v Speaker 1>direction that you injured it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1586
01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:53.010
<v Speaker 1>you're strengthening it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess would be the eccentric way.</v>

1587
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.660
<v Speaker 1>East centric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentra quit.</v>

1588
01:12:56.100 --> 01:12:56.933
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there you go.</v>

1589
01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Don't get tendinitis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kids.</v>

1590
01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:03.080
<v Speaker 3>I had recently from I think using cell</v>
<v Speaker 3>phones too much and computers too much,</v>

1591
01:13:03.190 --> 01:13:05.170
<v Speaker 3>like carpal tunnel to the point where my</v>
<v Speaker 3>hand hurt.</v>

1592
01:13:05.230 --> 01:13:07.900
<v Speaker 3>Like I think it's the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's repetitive stress.</v>

1593
01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:08.793
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1594
01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:12.610
<v Speaker 3>Secretaries get that right from a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>typing and stuff.</v>

1595
01:13:12.611 --> 01:13:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Hairstylists also get it a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1596
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:17.260
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I know a tattoo artist and has it.</v>

1597
01:13:18.090 --> 01:13:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it right now just me even saying it,</v>

1598
01:13:20.501 --> 01:13:22.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still actually really sore.</v>

1599
01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.490
<v Speaker 3>My hands go to guys who get it in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>risk too.</v>

1600
01:13:25.210 --> 01:13:26.560
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1601
01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:29.920
<v Speaker 3>for a lot of those guys they start</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting addicted to antiinflammatories</v>

1602
01:13:30.010 --> 01:13:32.680
<v Speaker 3>and know different things to try.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you have to use your fingers</v>

1603
01:13:32.681 --> 01:13:35.770
<v Speaker 3>for work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine if you had to do something with</v>

1604
01:13:35.771 --> 01:13:38.470
<v Speaker 3>your hands like that for work and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>started feeling that pain.</v>

1605
01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.050
<v Speaker 3>Like this is just my elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1606
01:13:41.051 --> 01:13:44.770
<v Speaker 3>I meaN I can do pretty much everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But your hands,</v>

1607
01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:46.420
<v Speaker 3>like if it's in your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

1608
01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:47.254
<v Speaker 3>that's a bitch.</v>

1609
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:52.040
<v Speaker 3>I was reading this article about</v>
<v Speaker 3>replacing body parts.</v>

1610
01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:55.190
<v Speaker 3>They were talking about all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>different body parts that are on the</v>

1611
01:13:55.191 --> 01:13:58.340
<v Speaker 3>verge of being able to replace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He dId a face transplant,</v>

1612
01:13:58.390 --> 01:13:59.850
<v Speaker 3>didn't they?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've done a few of those things.</v>

1613
01:13:59.860 --> 01:14:00.693
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1614
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:02.840
<v Speaker 3>They did a few dick transplants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cock and balls.</v>

1615
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>

1616
01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:08.060
<v Speaker 3>If they can't do the balls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who wants the balls?</v>

1617
01:14:08.061 --> 01:14:11.200
<v Speaker 3>You don't need them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's no.</v>

1618
01:14:11.300 --> 01:14:13.030
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing for ethical</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons,</v>

1619
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:16.960
<v Speaker 3>because the dead person's sperm will</v>
<v Speaker 3>always be in those balls.</v>

1620
01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:19.480
<v Speaker 3>So here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say if you,</v>

1621
01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.840
<v Speaker 3>if you took my balls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I died and you took my balls and put</v>

1622
01:14:22.841 --> 01:14:24.340
<v Speaker 3>them into your body and they started</v>
<v Speaker 3>having kids,</v>

1623
01:14:24.341 --> 01:14:27.160
<v Speaker 3>those would be my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would have my genes.</v>

1624
01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.520
<v Speaker 3>You can have my come inside of your body</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing.</v>

1625
01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:31.130

<v Speaker 5>so like I never wore earplugs and gone</v>
<v Speaker 5>to tons of concerts for like five plus</v>

1693

<v Speaker 5>years every other night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the cameras down.</v>

<v Speaker 5>just to see.</v>

1696
01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:25.220
<v Speaker 5>Occasionally just go real high and I</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1697
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:29.060
<v Speaker 5>I can't hear anything out of that year</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's sort of like plug it up or do</v>

1698
01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:31.880
<v Speaker 5>something and it'll go away eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but some more recently it's taken a</v>

1699
01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:34.250
<v Speaker 5>little longer to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have that sometimes it's usually when</v>

1700
01:17:34.251 --> 01:17:36.260
<v Speaker 5>it's really quiet and I'll just come out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of nowhere.</v>

1701
01:17:36.261 --> 01:17:39.530
<v Speaker 5>I hear this like ringing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's not like every day.</v>

1702
01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:40.613
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what it is though.</v>

1703
01:17:40.770 --> 01:17:41.780
<v Speaker 5>It's called the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1704
01:17:42.470 --> 01:17:44.890
<v Speaker 5>How do you get it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just an old too.</v>

1705
01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:46.040
<v Speaker 5>It's just hearing loss,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hearing loss</v>

1706
01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.680
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've heard loud things,</v>

1707
01:17:49.690 --> 01:17:52.140
<v Speaker 3>you've been the concerts over the years</v>
<v Speaker 3>that damage,</v>

1708
01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:55.080
<v Speaker 3>but the real thing I think is people</v>
<v Speaker 3>around guns a lot.</v>

1709
01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:58.860
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people who are around</v>
<v Speaker 3>guns a lot as a kid,</v>

1710
01:17:58.861 --> 01:18:02.310
<v Speaker 3>like they shot those clays with shotguns</v>
<v Speaker 3>and shoot those.</v>

1711
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:05.760
<v Speaker 3>John dudley has real bad hearing loss</v>
<v Speaker 3>from that.</v>

1712
01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:09.450
<v Speaker 3>Nobody ever Told kids back then that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they need to wear ear muffs,</v>

1713
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:13.410
<v Speaker 3>like nobody wore ear protection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would go to the range with just no</v>

1714
01:18:13.411 --> 01:18:14.244
<v Speaker 3>earmuffs on,</v>

1715
01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:15.061
<v Speaker 5>bang,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bang,</v>

1716
01:18:15.061 --> 01:18:19.020
<v Speaker 5>bang concerts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I had growing up.</v>

1717
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:21.870
<v Speaker 5>I ever even thought of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I would sit right next to the</v>

1718
01:18:21.871 --> 01:18:24.960
<v Speaker 5>speaker on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I had a nine inch nail concert just</v>

1719
01:18:24.961 --> 01:18:25.880
<v Speaker 5>because like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh man,</v>

1720
01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:28.260
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're no one talked about that.</v>

1721
01:18:28.261 --> 01:18:28.980
<v Speaker 5>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's true</v>

1722
01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:31.420
<v Speaker 3>nicholas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

1723
01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:37.210
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see if you can find video of them in</v>

1724
01:18:37.211 --> 01:18:42.190
<v Speaker 3>a gun range with no ear protection</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't think I'm making that</v>

1725
01:18:42.191 --> 01:18:44.260
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I remember look watching people</v>

1726
01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:47.530
<v Speaker 3>on a range to shooting guns with no</v>
<v Speaker 3>earplugs</v>

1727
01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:49.500
<v Speaker 5>nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter that because their</v>

1728
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:52.750
<v Speaker 5>hearing aids nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like you have earbuds in now and</v>

1729
01:18:52.751 --> 01:18:54.850
<v Speaker 5>you get bluetooth to your phone and</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

1730
01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:57.700
<v Speaker 5>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to hear hearing aids.</v>

1731
01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:01.010
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have those things called game ears.</v>

1732
01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:06.460
<v Speaker 3>You can put them in your hearing in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>ear canal rather like a hearing aid and</v>

1733
01:19:07.821 --> 01:19:12.821
<v Speaker 3>they amplify sounds extraordinarily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And hunters use them in the woods.</v>

1734
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:15.950
<v Speaker 3>They put them in and you can see the</v>
<v Speaker 3>column game is,</v>

1735
01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.570
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called a walker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His game here.</v>

1736
01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.700
<v Speaker 3>I put it on before it freaked me out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Took it right off.</v>

1737
01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:21.280
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want to hear this.</v>

1738
01:19:21.460 --> 01:19:22.460
<v Speaker 5>You're looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly,</v>

1739
01:19:22.461 --> 01:19:25.100
<v Speaker 5>but this guy is trying to tell people</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to do it and he was just plugging up</v>

1740
01:19:25.101 --> 01:19:25.680
<v Speaker 5>as here.</v>

1741
01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what I'm looking for.</v>

1742
01:19:27.691 --> 01:19:32.160
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking for like old school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this shoot guns.</v>

1743
01:19:32.161 --> 01:19:36.810
<v Speaker 3>If I don't have ear protection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just put some articles to people</v>

1744
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:38.580
<v Speaker 3>discussing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nothing's really.</v>

1745
01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.750
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I imagined it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember seeing like an old school</v>

1746
01:19:42.751 --> 01:19:45.870
<v Speaker 3>range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some dude with a pistol with like a</v>

1747
01:19:45.871 --> 01:19:49.770
<v Speaker 3>thick belt like lowe's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hippies used to wearing a belt buckle</v>

1748
01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.170
<v Speaker 3>and he's firing off that gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>

1749
01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:53.910
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1750
01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:54.810
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

1751
01:19:56.020 --> 01:19:59.140
<v Speaker 5>I think the first time I shot a gun I</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't have headphones or ear thing.</v>

1752
01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:02.620
<v Speaker 5>Protecting a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a bad idea.</v>

1753
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:04.200
<v Speaker 3>This does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys don't know what your</v>

1754
01:20:04.201 --> 01:20:05.940
<v Speaker 3>protection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets up and he was lIke,</v>

1755
01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:07.140
<v Speaker 3>because he has a concussion.</v>

1756
01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Catch his breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so dumb.</v>

1757
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how powerful these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are?</v>

1758
01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:16.260
<v Speaker 1>This is how powerful of 50 calibers</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody decided.</v>

1759
01:20:16.261 --> 01:20:20.640
<v Speaker 1>that's the 30 caliber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody decided to try to hunt deer</v>

1760
01:20:20.641 --> 01:20:22.500
<v Speaker 1>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a video.</v>

1761
01:20:22.501 --> 01:20:26.070
<v Speaker 1>You could find it online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guy mrs dear,</v>

1762
01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.550
<v Speaker 1>and the deer's head exploded as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>missed.</v>

1763
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:33.810
<v Speaker 1>The eyes popped out of his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought it was a perfect headshot</v>

1764
01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:39.200
<v Speaker 1>because the deer just went down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what it actually was was that the</v>

1765
01:20:39.391 --> 01:20:44.100
<v Speaker 1>bullet passing by had so much force it</v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously killed the deer.</v>

1766
01:20:44.190 --> 01:20:45.270
<v Speaker 1>That crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

1767
01:20:45.271 --> 01:20:48.030
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

1768
01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Here it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this.</v>

1769
01:20:52.730 --> 01:20:57.200
<v Speaker 1>So he does this and he's got this big</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass fucking gun.</v>

1770
01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.270
<v Speaker 1>It says 50 bmg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1771
01:20:59.271 --> 01:21:01.760
<v Speaker 1>What that means is that 50 calibers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that means.</v>

1772
01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.190
<v Speaker 1>So look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes over to the,</v>

1773
01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:08.180
<v Speaker 1>to the deer and there's no bullet hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just eyes had blown out of his</v>

1774
01:21:08.181 --> 01:21:12.590
<v Speaker 1>fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just from the sheer force of that thing</v>

1775
01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:16.630
<v Speaker 1>passing by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1776
01:21:16.631 --> 01:21:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see it like there's a slow</v>

1777
01:21:18.461 --> 01:21:23.461
<v Speaker 1>motion of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See it passes by.</v>

1778
01:21:24.130 --> 01:21:29.130
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't even hit it and the deer</v>
<v Speaker 1>just disappears into the night.</v>

1779
01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:32.920
<v Speaker 1>That's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like imagine it has so much force.</v>

1780
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:37.040
<v Speaker 1>It can miss a deer and kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1781
01:21:37.750 --> 01:21:42.750
<v Speaker 1>That is so unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is such a war weapon.</v>

1782
01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amen.</v>

1783
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:51.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a crazy thing to go hunting with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who</v>

1784
01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:56.440
<v Speaker 5>do you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you use uber a lot like.</v>

1785
01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.070
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you never do.</v>

1786
01:21:58.570 --> 01:22:00.950
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's too risky.</v>

1787
01:22:01.010 --> 01:22:03.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm starting to not trust and it's so</v>
<v Speaker 5>weird.</v>

1788
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:06.940
<v Speaker 5>I use it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I use delivery,</v>

1789
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:11.950
<v Speaker 5>serve food delivery services all the</v>
<v Speaker 5>time and I'm having second thoughts on</v>

1790
01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.120
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's great.</v>

1791
01:22:14.121 --> 01:22:14.990
<v Speaker 5>I think uber's great.</v>

1792
01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm just fucking around with saying it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>risky.</v>

1793
01:22:16.650 --> 01:22:19.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea that you could just call</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cab like,</v>

1794
01:22:19.361 --> 01:22:21.310
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come I can't just call an uber?</v>

1795
01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:26.320
<v Speaker 1>The only argument would be that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't screen the people as well as the</v>

1796
01:22:26.321 --> 01:22:27.150
<v Speaker 1>cab companies.</v>

1797
01:22:27.150 --> 01:22:29.100
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's regulated.</v>

1798
01:22:29.101 --> 01:22:29.490
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

1799
01:22:29.490 --> 01:22:32.160
<v Speaker 5>Which is why people like limos though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They prefer limos,</v>

1800
01:22:32.190 --> 01:22:33.480
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1801
01:22:33.481 --> 01:22:36.020
<v Speaker 5>I was in one recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That kid was probably.</v>

1802
01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:37.980
<v Speaker 5>He seemed like he was like 17.</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>

1803
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:42.150
<v Speaker 5>I had no way this is my dryer and I felt</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he was drunk,</v>

1804
01:22:42.570 --> 01:22:45.030
<v Speaker 5>like capital,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do I get outta here?</v>

1805
01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:46.860
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like run a highway right now.</v>

1806
01:22:46.861 --> 01:22:49.500
<v Speaker 5>I can't just tell him to pull over on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the side of the highway,</v>

1807
01:22:49.501 --> 01:22:51.670
<v Speaker 5>but I feel like he's going to kill me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1808
01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lady recently that went on</v>

1809
01:22:55.651 --> 01:22:58.770
<v Speaker 1>this whole tweet thread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

1810
01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.430
<v Speaker 1>she tweeted a bunch of different things</v>
<v Speaker 1>to uber about.</v>

1811
01:23:02.431 --> 01:23:07.431
<v Speaker 1>A guy was an uber or was it lift one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those where a guy had taken her under a</v>

1812
01:23:09.641 --> 01:23:14.030
<v Speaker 1>bridge and wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't give her her stuff back and</v>

1813
01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:19.031
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't let her out of the car and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>passer by stopped and helped her and she</v>

1814
01:23:19.321 --> 01:23:21.670
<v Speaker 1>was screaming at the guy and the guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>took off,</v>

1815
01:23:22.450 --> 01:23:24.550
<v Speaker 1>but it was to a point where she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1816
01:23:24.670 --> 01:23:26.030
<v Speaker 1>is this guy going to rape me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1817
01:23:26.031 --> 01:23:27.310
<v Speaker 1>is this guy going to kill me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1818
01:23:27.311 --> 01:23:29.980
<v Speaker 1>is this how I'm going to end?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just jumped in the car with a</v>

1819
01:23:29.981 --> 01:23:33.010
<v Speaker 1>stranger and now he's decided to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and it's not.</v>

1820
01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.770
<v Speaker 1>It's not where we're supposed to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not telling me why.</v>

1821
01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:40.810
<v Speaker 1>That's that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I guess that could theoretically</v>

1822
01:23:40.811 --> 01:23:45.550
<v Speaker 1>happen with any ride rideshare company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with uber it's so weird.</v>

1823
01:23:45.551 --> 01:23:49.120
<v Speaker 1>It's just a person just get some person</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come get you and you don't have to be</v>

1824
01:23:49.121 --> 01:23:50.440
<v Speaker 1>hired by a company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1825
01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.000
<v Speaker 5>You never thought that with taxis</v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

1826
01:23:52.001 --> 01:23:53.580
<v Speaker 5>Like you never thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1827
01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.110
<v Speaker 5>you always kind of like taxis were</v>
<v Speaker 5>transportation.</v>

1834
01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's an easy way to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

01:24:11.690 --> 01:24:13.550
<v Speaker 1>but you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like a ride.</v>

1836
01:24:13.551 --> 01:24:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes those people you'd get in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>

1837
01:24:15.891 --> 01:24:16.850
<v Speaker 1>like it'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>horn.</v>

1842
01:24:28.911 --> 01:24:32.480
<v Speaker 1>12 hours a day and so you don't expect</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because you come from</v>

1843
01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:33.980
<v Speaker 5>columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ohio.</v>

<v Speaker 5>we're from columbus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>WasTe.</v>

1845
01:24:36.801 --> 01:24:37.910

1846
01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:42.270
<v Speaker 1>No amish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amish.</v>

1847
01:24:42.330 --> 01:24:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you still have the amish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1848

<v Speaker 1>still don't wear deodorant.</v>

1849
01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Every time I go to New York and I get in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car and some new yorkers driving</v>

1850
01:24:51.351 --> 01:24:51.801
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1851

<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guys are in the matrix.</v>

1852
01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Like they dress drive so much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressively.</v>

1853
01:24:57.650 --> 01:25:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you hire a car to drive you around in</v>

1854
01:25:00.801 --> 01:25:03.080
<v Speaker 1>New York city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they drive so much more aggressively.</v>

1855
01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:04.460
<v Speaker 1>They're just so used to it.</v>

1856
01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:09.300
<v Speaker 5>I just remember as a kid going to like</v>
<v Speaker 5>wind dot lake and amusement parks.</v>

1857
01:25:09.301 --> 01:25:12.170
<v Speaker 5>They always went as a group to amusement</v>
<v Speaker 5>parks.</v>

1858
01:25:12.171 --> 01:25:16.530
<v Speaker 5>So there's like 200 amish people mixed</v>
<v Speaker 5>in with us and we'd be like 14,</v>

1859
01:25:16.830 --> 01:25:21.270
<v Speaker 5>13 and like look at those guys than the</v>
<v Speaker 5>amish people always acted like so almost</v>

1860
01:25:21.271 --> 01:25:22.400
<v Speaker 5>like alien,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1861
01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:27.430
<v Speaker 5>like the film the country and they talk</v>
<v Speaker 5>weird and I don't really talk like us</v>

1862
01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:28.793
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well they stated</v>

1863
01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:29.980
<v Speaker 1>to themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1864
01:25:29.981 --> 01:25:31.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know that they could go to</v>

1865
01:25:31.601 --> 01:25:34.060
<v Speaker 1>amusement parks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought there the whole idea was that</v>

1866
01:25:34.061 --> 01:25:35.830
<v Speaker 1>they can't use electronics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That might not have been.</v>

1867
01:25:35.980 --> 01:25:37.750
<v Speaker 1>That could have been like a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

1868
01:25:37.930 --> 01:25:39.670
<v Speaker 1>There's different kinds of mennonites</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

1869
01:25:39.671 --> 01:25:40.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1870
01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:41.770
<v Speaker 1>There's different kinds of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quakers.</v>

1871
01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Quakers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was with [inaudible].</v>

1872
01:25:44.410 --> 01:25:47.140
<v Speaker 1>We were in Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>western Massachusetts.</v>

1873
01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:49.720
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we stopped into this fucking truck,</v>

1874
01:25:49.721 --> 01:25:54.410
<v Speaker 1>stopped to get gas and grabbed something</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat and there's a group of mennonites</v>

1875
01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:58.300
<v Speaker 1>and there's some girl that's wearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this mennonite outfit and I forget how</v>

1876
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:59.660
<v Speaker 1>ari asked her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really wish,</v>

1877
01:25:59.661 --> 01:26:01.510
<v Speaker 1>but it was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something.</v>

1878
01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Something along the lines of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what you in</v>

1879
01:26:05.150 --> 01:26:09.590
<v Speaker 3>something along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might have been more tactful than</v>

1880
01:26:09.591 --> 01:26:11.120
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it was something like,</v>

1881
01:26:11.130 --> 01:26:13.910
<v Speaker 3>what's this all about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you dressed like that?</v>

1882
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:16.160
<v Speaker 3>I think I remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I was there.</v>

1883
01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:20.100
<v Speaker 3>I think you were too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was something along the lines of a</v>

1884
01:26:20.290 --> 01:26:23.060
<v Speaker 3>group that you're with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was something to the point where</v>

1885
01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:25.820
<v Speaker 3>we were all of course baked out of our</v>
<v Speaker 3>minds.</v>

1886
01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:27.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>We just tried to have a good time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>she answered politely and nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a.</v>

1896
01:26:51.291 --> 01:26:54.410
<v Speaker 3>Because he was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As a child,</v>

1897
01:26:54.411 --> 01:26:58.880
<v Speaker 3>he was raised to be a very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very strict orthodox jew.</v>

1898
01:26:59.410 --> 01:27:01.160
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He spent time,</v>

1899
01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:05.300
<v Speaker 3>I forget what it's called when you go</v>
<v Speaker 3>over to Israel and you just read the</v>

1900
01:27:05.301 --> 01:27:09.050
<v Speaker 3>torah like fucking 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>12 hours a day.</v>

1901
01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.700
<v Speaker 3>He did that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>

1902
01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:13.880
<v Speaker 3>He grew the curls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had the little strings and hanging</v>

1903
01:27:13.881 --> 01:27:16.480
<v Speaker 3>from his belt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did all that smiths or something.</v>

1904
01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:19.730
<v Speaker 3>What it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called orthodox,</v>

1905
01:27:19.731 --> 01:27:20.990
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's orthodox judaism.</v>

1906
01:27:20.991 --> 01:27:21.824
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1907
01:27:21.890 --> 01:27:25.050
<v Speaker 3>So when anybody tries to run any</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit by ra and he's like,</v>

1908
01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:29.390
<v Speaker 3>I know this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows all that stuff.</v>

1909
01:27:29.420 --> 01:27:31.510
<v Speaker 3>He stabbed the weird curls to and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>

1910
01:27:31.550 --> 01:27:32.870
<v Speaker 3>He had all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1911
01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:36.080
<v Speaker 3>And then he just realized as he got</v>
<v Speaker 3>older and wiser,</v>

1912
01:27:36.081 --> 01:27:36.771
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

<v Speaker 3>But he's a,</v>

1916
01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:49.070
<v Speaker 3>he's a funny guy with that stuff because</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I think only someone who's truly</v>

1917
01:27:49.071 --> 01:27:51.380
<v Speaker 3>seen it from the eyes of an absolute</v>
<v Speaker 3>believer.</v>

1918
01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:56.900
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that he's gotten through so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird looks.</v>

1919
01:27:56.940 --> 01:28:00.710
<v Speaker 3>Remember when he just had like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he would always wear the small hats</v>

1920
01:28:00.770 --> 01:28:02.960
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like small hats,</v>

1921
01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:04.870

1922
01:28:04.871 --> 01:28:07.460
<v Speaker 3>the hat on that would just hang on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>side of his head.</v>

1923
01:28:07.461 --> 01:28:09.640
<v Speaker 3>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he had like his head shaped like</v>

1924
01:28:09.641 --> 01:28:11.810

<v Speaker 3>So like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not buying any of this.</v>

1943
01:28:58.070 --> 01:29:00.320
<v Speaker 3>Like I know where this is like why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do people like.</v>

1944
01:29:00.321 --> 01:29:01.710
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing with psychics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1945
01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:05.400
<v Speaker 3>Like why do people have this need to</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold onto irrational beliefs?</v>

1946
01:29:05.401 --> 01:29:07.890
<v Speaker 3>Like there are some questions you don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have answers to.</v>

1947
01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:11.550
<v Speaker 3>You know you don't have answers to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why don't you pretend that this one,</v>

1948
01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.500
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this answers can take its place.</v>

1949
01:29:13.650 --> 01:29:15.270
<v Speaker 3>This answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of know bullshit.</v>

1950
01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:17.370
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take its place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do we need to do that?</v>

1951
01:29:17.610 --> 01:29:20.550
<v Speaker 3>Because so many of us do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm not immune to it.</v>

1952
01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:22.530
<v Speaker 3>We're all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we all need that feeling.</v>

1953
01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.630
<v Speaker 3>You know the to know still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be okay,</v>

1954
01:29:24.631 --> 01:29:25.800
<v Speaker 3>brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how everything's gonna be.</v>

1955
01:29:25.801 --> 01:29:28.170
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes me wonder if you did the whole</v>

1956
01:29:28.171 --> 01:29:30.990
<v Speaker 3>gun theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this is real or not to religion,</v>

1957
01:29:30.991 --> 01:29:34.410
<v Speaker 3>how many people would say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all real and who would go?</v>

1958
01:29:34.650 --> 01:29:36.240
<v Speaker 3>Even the most religious person would</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

1959
01:29:36.241 --> 01:29:37.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course not.</v>

1960
01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:38.280
<v Speaker 3>We on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

1961
01:29:38.281 --> 01:29:40.620

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1962
01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:42.750
<v Speaker 3>I think a bunch of people would take a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet.</v>

1963
01:29:44.630 --> 01:29:48.830
<v Speaker 3>If you want to punish me for my lord</v>
<v Speaker 3>heaven,</v>

1964
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:52.560
<v Speaker 3>they'd take it right in the temple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

1965
01:29:52.590 --> 01:29:55.020
<v Speaker 3>Piles of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Piles of bodies at walmart.</v>

1966
01:29:55.150 --> 01:29:55.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1967
01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:59.610
<v Speaker 3>People would just blow their brains out</v>
<v Speaker 3>for their heavenly father does command</v>

1968
01:29:59.611 --> 01:30:03.250
<v Speaker 3>you to come see him in heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

1969
01:30:04.290 --> 01:30:05.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lot of people would do it.</v>

1970
01:30:06.150 --> 01:30:08.840
<v Speaker 3>Guaranteed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1971
01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:11.460
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like even what's going on with the</v>

1972
01:30:11.461 --> 01:30:13.380
<v Speaker 3>pope just recently said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no hell.</v>

1973
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:14.970
<v Speaker 3>Everybody went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1974
01:30:14.971 --> 01:30:17.140
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did he just sang?</v>

1975
01:30:17.730 --> 01:30:20.640
<v Speaker 3>The pope said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no hell he's,</v>

1976
01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:25.710
<v Speaker 3>he's slowly bracing you for the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that all this is nonsense,</v>

1977
01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:27.810
<v Speaker 3>but right now we're going to get rid of</v>
<v Speaker 3>hell.</v>

1978
01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:31.410
<v Speaker 3>Like this is like one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the purest examples of like the</v>

1979
01:30:31.411 --> 01:30:33.570
<v Speaker 3>change in people's attitudes towards</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious real.</v>

1980
01:30:33.630 --> 01:30:34.463
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1981
01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:36.550
<v Speaker 3>The vatican denies that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1982
01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:40.440
<v Speaker 3>the vatican did not say there is no hell</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll find out an article where it says</v>

1983
01:30:40.441 --> 01:30:44.610
<v Speaker 3>he did say that 50 percent shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to cut it back.</v>

1984
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Go back in time and find an article</v>
<v Speaker 3>where he did say,</v>

1985
01:30:48.180 --> 01:30:49.710
<v Speaker 3>I guarantee you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did say,</v>

1986
01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:53.550
<v Speaker 3>let's just assume at one day the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See this is what they do.</v>

1987
01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:56.010
<v Speaker 3>They say it a little bit and then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>take it back.</v>

1988
01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.110
<v Speaker 3>So they get used to the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're saying it.</v>

1989
01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:02.220
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm full eddie bravo right now for</v>

1990
01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:03.840
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

1991
01:31:03.841 --> 01:31:07.760
<v Speaker 3>This is how they set it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They start out with uh,</v>

1992
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tell you the hell's not real.</v>

1993
01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:11.220
<v Speaker 3>Then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we never said that.</v>

1994
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:12.840
<v Speaker 3>And then a year from now they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1995
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:16.860
<v Speaker 3>we're pretty sure hell is not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This pope probably plays fortnight and</v>

1996
01:31:16.861 --> 01:31:17.760
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He got rid of the throne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2001
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

01:35:17.271 --> 01:35:21.590
<v Speaker 3>out and lay all these candles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always wanted to be the guy that puts</v>

<v Speaker 3>them out with that bell on the hook.</v>

2087
01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:41.680
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like people figured out some way to</v>

2088
01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:48.820
<v Speaker 3>make the bridge between physical</v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution and mental evolution.</v>

2089
01:35:49.431 --> 01:35:53.240
<v Speaker 3>Like there's this bridge between us not</v>
<v Speaker 3>being monkeys anymore,</v>

2090
01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:58.100
<v Speaker 3>but still we just want to get out of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>barbarian behavior.</v>

2091
01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:03.360
<v Speaker 3>We've got to figure out a way to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to like have reverence for</v>

2092
01:36:04.191 --> 01:36:08.000
<v Speaker 3>something is all powerful and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>control their behavior.</v>

01:45:15.461 --> 01:45:17.230
<v Speaker 1>three year old just learning how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>

2288
01:45:22.190 --> 01:45:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you about.</v>

2290
01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:30.650
<v Speaker 1>This is the future we're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>having arguments with our digital</v>

2291
01:45:30.651 --> 01:45:35.510
<v Speaker 1>devices like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a crude like helper.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I get super crude helper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2293
01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Like what siri could do and not do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very crude,</v>

2294
01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:45.100
<v Speaker 1>but this is just like the iphone one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2295
01:45:45.610 --> 01:45:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're going to have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're absolutely going to have some</v>

2296
01:45:49.821 --> 01:45:52.760
<v Speaker 1>sort of ai that can keep up with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation for sure.</v>

2297
01:45:52.761 --> 01:45:53.594
<v Speaker 1>That's going to happen.</v>

2298
01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:56.400
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty crazy how much ahead.</v>

2299
01:45:56.401 --> 01:45:59.910
<v Speaker 5>I think google and alexa are ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 5>siri,</v>

2300
01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:01.410
<v Speaker 5>like there's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2301
01:46:01.411 --> 01:46:03.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>having both of the home pod on the siri</v>

2302
01:46:03.781 --> 01:46:07.020
<v Speaker 5>and alexa echo or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's night and day difference.</v>

2303
01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:09.010
<v Speaker 1>What's better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Siri or bixby?</v>

2304
01:46:09.370 --> 01:46:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Bixby is a samsung one.</v>

2305
01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:12.360
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think uh,</v>

2306
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:13.860
<v Speaker 5>well big speeds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very new.</v>

2307
01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:16.860
<v Speaker 5>I think series better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like alexa,</v>

2308
01:46:17.370 --> 01:46:19.350
<v Speaker 5>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've even improved alexis so much.</v>

2309
01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:21.090
<v Speaker 5>Were you seeing like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey alexa,</v>

2310
01:46:21.091 --> 01:46:25.500
<v Speaker 5>sing me a love song and there's a whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>song that alexa sings deal and there's</v>

2311
01:46:25.501 --> 01:46:26.760
<v Speaker 5>like 10 of these songs.</v>

2312
01:46:26.930 --> 01:46:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that google has it down the best</v>

2313
01:46:29.301 --> 01:46:32.510
<v Speaker 1>with the google pixel two phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you squeeze the sides and the</v>

2314
01:46:32.511 --> 01:46:35.690
<v Speaker 1>google assistant comes on and when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>google assistant comes on and you just</v>

2315
01:46:35.691 --> 01:46:38.150
<v Speaker 1>ask it anything and google assistant is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just better.</v>

2316
01:46:38.300 --> 01:46:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Google is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

2317
01:46:39.621 --> 01:46:41.120
<v Speaker 1>it just works better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

2318
01:46:41.121 --> 01:46:43.460
<v Speaker 1>it's better if it finds your results</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

2319
01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:46.340
<v Speaker 1>It As clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem as weird,</v>

2343
01:47:50.791 --> 01:47:52.530
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see why they did it,</v>

2344
01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:55.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's a shape found anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who cares?</v>

2345
01:47:58.140 --> 01:47:58.620
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

2346
01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:03.620
<v Speaker 1>apparently they're in some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dispute with huawei about Iran.</v>

2347
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:08.070
<v Speaker 1>See if we can find that like something</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to be punished.</v>

2348
01:48:08.071 --> 01:48:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Something I ran something about servers</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they sold to Iran.</v>

2349
01:48:12.091 --> 01:48:14.490
<v Speaker 1>They're not supposed to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2350
01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:18.420
<v Speaker 1>jamie will find the article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they were saying we recommend</v>

2351
01:48:18.421 --> 01:48:22.200
<v Speaker 1>you not using that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consumers not use their phones.</v>

2352
01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:26.130
<v Speaker 1>And a bunch of tech guys that I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading,</v>

2353
01:48:26.220 --> 01:48:29.220
<v Speaker 1>I was reading a bunch of articles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tech guys were super skeptical</v>

2354
01:48:29.490 --> 01:48:30.600
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

2355
01:48:30.601 --> 01:48:33.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like with anything is in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll find it like you,</v>

2356
01:48:33.881 --> 01:48:38.881
<v Speaker 1>you can't just say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be using these things as spy</v>

2357
01:48:38.911 --> 01:48:42.690
<v Speaker 1>devices without any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without any evidence.</v>

2358
01:48:42.691 --> 01:48:47.610
<v Speaker 1>It says while ways under us criminal</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigation for illegal Iran sales</v>

2359
01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:49.350
<v Speaker 1>heels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's next.</v>

2360
01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:51.120
<v Speaker 1>So the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other,</v>

2361
01:48:51.121 --> 01:48:53.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory by the super conspiracy theorists</v>

2362
01:48:53.611 --> 01:48:56.160
<v Speaker 1>is that they're trying to keep out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>number three,</v>

2363
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:59.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phone maker in the world from</v>

2364
01:48:59.671 --> 01:49:04.500

<v Speaker 1>and economically strengthening the</v>

2365
01:49:04.530 --> 01:49:07.710
<v Speaker 1>communist government over there or</v>
<v Speaker 1>pseudo communist government.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>

2367

<v Speaker 1>you can make money.</v>

2369
01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:12.750
<v Speaker 2>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I literally saw sometimes stumbled</v>

<v Speaker 1>500 gigabytes of storage.</v>

2383
01:50:01.210 --> 01:50:03.850

<v Speaker 1>It's got a 40 megapixel camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns,</v>

2385
01:50:07.150 --> 01:50:09.400
<v Speaker 1>literally turns night into day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you take photos,</v>

2386
01:50:09.670 --> 01:50:12.400
<v Speaker 1>like when they have a list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a four second aperture will stay</v>

2387
01:50:12.401 --> 01:50:14.470
<v Speaker 1>open and you see the pictures and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2388
01:50:14.471 --> 01:50:17.530
<v Speaker 1>holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see regular camera photos.</v>

2389
01:50:17.531 --> 01:50:18.820
<v Speaker 1>And then they see the photos with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>

2390
01:50:18.821 --> 01:50:19.870
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands down.</v>

2391
01:50:20.020 --> 01:50:22.690
<v Speaker 1>This is the best camera in cell phones</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

2392
01:50:22.730 --> 01:50:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how hard it would be to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>that picture though?</v>

2393
01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:25.533
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super hard.</v>

2394
01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Deadly for four seconds or the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be all blurry and fucked up.</v>

2395
01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that works.</v>

2396
01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:35.530
<v Speaker 1>You do more than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would have to really hold it steady.</v>

2397
01:50:35.530 --> 01:50:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2398
01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:39.520
<v Speaker 1>like sit it on something ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't even track my button.</v>

2399
01:50:39.521 --> 01:50:42.700
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to have a remote trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd fuck it up by even maybe touching</v>

2400
01:50:42.701 --> 01:50:45.250
<v Speaker 1>it and then it'll give you a slight</v>
<v Speaker 1>pause and then they'll start.</v>

2401
01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:47.020
<v Speaker 1>They don't probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might do that now actually,</v>

2402
01:50:47.021 --> 01:50:49.570
<v Speaker 1>but they don't typically do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you can go to that.</v>

2403
01:50:49.590 --> 01:50:51.700
<v Speaker 1>It's camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to the walway.</v>

2404
01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:53.710
<v Speaker 1>What is the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like the mate 10 art.</v>

2405
01:50:53.770 --> 01:50:54.603
<v Speaker 1>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2406
01:50:54.620 --> 01:50:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Do this phone as this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm disgusted that it's a spy device</v>

2407
01:50:59.441 --> 01:51:03.610
<v Speaker 1>because I want one so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think.</v>

2408
01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2409
01:51:04.991 --> 01:51:07.000
<v Speaker 1>have you looked at the reviews?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we terrible?</v>

2410
01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:07.841
<v Speaker 1>Their reviews?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably like,</v>

2411
01:51:07.841 --> 01:51:10.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as good as an iphone if I want</v>

2412
01:51:10.291 --> 01:51:15.291
<v Speaker 1>it to be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the fact that there's</v>

2413
01:51:15.371 --> 01:51:17.560
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me excited.</v>

2414
01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:19.460
<v Speaker 1>You just like the porsche wall felt like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>

2415
01:51:19.810 --> 01:51:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

2416
01:51:21.250 --> 01:51:23.530
<v Speaker 1>I like those cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked their engineering.</v>

2417
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:24.703
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2418
01:51:24.940 --> 01:51:28.730
<v Speaker 1>they're german wizards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know how to design shit and a</v>

2419
01:51:28.731 --> 01:51:31.270
<v Speaker 1>really spectacular way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make cool stuff.</v>

2420
01:51:31.450 --> 01:51:34.870
<v Speaker 1>They make cool watches and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think what's really.</v>

2421
01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:37.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of things interesting to</v>

2422
01:51:37.061 --> 01:51:38.890
<v Speaker 1>me about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's interesting to me is when</v>

2423
01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:44.220
<v Speaker 1>these cameras and these phones from</v>
<v Speaker 1>these android manufacturers are so good,</v>

2424
01:51:45.010 --> 01:51:47.980
<v Speaker 1>it forces apple to come with some next</v>
<v Speaker 1>level shit too.</v>

2425
01:51:47.981 --> 01:51:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a technology race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike any other race,</v>

2426
01:51:52.150 --> 01:51:55.300
<v Speaker 1>like computers have even stalled out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2427
01:51:55.301 --> 01:51:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Like you get a new mac book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you even pay attention to what the</v>

2428
01:51:58.361 --> 01:52:01.480
<v Speaker 1>fucking gigabytes are now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>

2429
01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:04.960
<v Speaker 1>you remember the gigahertz were like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing like you want to log a two point</v>

2430
01:52:04.961 --> 01:52:06.790
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I pay more for the three point</v>

2431
01:52:06.791 --> 01:52:07.930
<v Speaker 1>two?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

2432
01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$300.</v>

2433
01:52:09.340 --> 01:52:11.350
<v Speaker 1>$500 more for one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2434
01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:14.170
<v Speaker 1>Remember they take those celeron and</v>
<v Speaker 1>overclocking.</v>

2435
01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:18.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will do anything to get to one,</v>

2436
01:52:18.980 --> 01:52:20.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

2437
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:23.130
<v Speaker 1>100 megahertz or what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

2438
01:52:23.190 --> 01:52:26.320
<v Speaker 1>what's like three gigahertz is like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good laptop,</v>

2439
01:52:26.321 --> 01:52:29.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about quad core processors now.</v>

2440
01:52:30.610 --> 01:52:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Right now it's course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the old days like you'd get like</v>

2441
01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:40.140
<v Speaker 1>a celeron 400 right multithreading</v>
<v Speaker 1>thread.</v>

2442
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Like when they hit one gigahertz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were shitting their pants.</v>

2443
01:52:43.961 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't believe we got a one</v>

2444
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:48.110
<v Speaker 5>gigahertz computer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is madness.</v>

2445
01:52:48.410 --> 01:52:51.530
<v Speaker 5>Overclocking still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it pushes above five,</v>

2446
01:52:51.531 --> 01:52:52.070
<v Speaker 5>maybe</v>

2447
01:52:52.070 --> 01:52:56.750
<v Speaker 1>number overclocking due to go into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>little spacers were those things called</v>

2448
01:52:56.751 --> 01:52:57.501
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumpers,</v>

2449
01:52:57.501 --> 01:53:00.950
<v Speaker 1>the jumpers and move them around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>change things in the bios.</v>

2450
01:53:01.190 --> 01:53:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Your fuckIng computer be catching on</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire and be running so hot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like build quality,</v>

2469
01:53:56.011 --> 01:54:01.011
<v Speaker 1>the way a mac book fields with the metal</v>
<v Speaker 1>frame and still tight tolerances and it</v>

2472
01:54:03.771 --> 01:54:06.230
<v Speaker 5>It's powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I use it for virtual reality and</v>

2473
01:54:06.231 --> 01:54:08.420
<v Speaker 5>it's scott,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the best graphics cards you can</v>

2474
01:54:08.421 --> 01:54:10.520
<v Speaker 5>buy and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty sweet.</v>

2475
01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:10.970
<v Speaker 5>I used to</v>

2476
01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:14.150
<v Speaker 1>by everything apple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to just buy apple laptops,</v>

2477
01:54:14.151 --> 01:54:17.360
<v Speaker 1>apple phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I like it that it's a question now,</v>

2478
01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:18.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I told you that I started using</v>

2479
01:54:18.951 --> 01:54:22.210
<v Speaker 1>that thinkpad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the thing way better than a mac</v>

2480
01:54:22.211 --> 01:54:24.830
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The keyboard is way more responsive.</v>

2481
01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:26.840
<v Speaker 1>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's travel to the keys,</v>

2482
01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:30.650
<v Speaker 1>like it's easier to type like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about those little clickety</v>

2483
01:54:30.651 --> 01:54:35.651
<v Speaker 1>click keys that the new mac books have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you the you make more mistakes?</v>

2484
01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:37.213
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

2485
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:39.800
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a feel to them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

2486
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:40.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2487
01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:41.180
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that clicked.</v>

2488
01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That clicked through a clumsy type or</v>

2489
01:54:43.881 --> 01:54:47.780
<v Speaker 1>like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I type way better on a keyboard that has</v>

2490
01:54:47.781 --> 01:54:49.910
<v Speaker 1>some travel to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you get some feel,</v>

2491
01:54:50.090 --> 01:54:53.240
<v Speaker 1>you get a feel of what you're doing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the letters are.</v>

2492
01:54:53.780 --> 01:54:58.780
<v Speaker 5>The new macbook pro is probably one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the worst versions of any mac book pro</v>

2493
01:54:59.031 --> 01:55:02.690
<v Speaker 5>since they started making it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hate the new mac book pro with a</v>

2494
01:55:02.691 --> 01:55:06.290
<v Speaker 5>passion in that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The the dongle shit needs to stop.</v>

2495
01:55:06.291 --> 01:55:09.050
<v Speaker 5>Like the other day I needed a usb port.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't.</v>

2496
01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:10.550
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forgot my dongle.</v>

2497
01:55:10.610 --> 01:55:13.250
<v Speaker 5>There was no way for me to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anything that I needed to do.</v>

2498
01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:18.010
<v Speaker 5>It's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the worst us hudson's just not</v>

2499
01:55:18.290 --> 01:55:19.820
<v Speaker 1>where yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know wHat I mean?</v>

2500
01:55:19.821 --> 01:55:22.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of things you could charge</v>
<v Speaker 1>your phone with usbc with.</v>

2501
01:55:22.491 --> 01:55:25.370
<v Speaker 1>There's some things that you have their</v>
<v Speaker 1>old usb and if you have to be like,</v>

2502
01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:26.233
<v Speaker 1>oh</v>

2503
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:30.100
<v Speaker 5>well this is useless.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish apple would have a exchange</v>

2504
01:55:30.101 --> 01:55:33.940
<v Speaker 5>program where you could go in and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll take out your touch bar and that</v>

2505
01:55:33.941 --> 01:55:36.430
<v Speaker 5>keyboard and just put in like any</v>
<v Speaker 5>keyboard you want.</v>

2506
01:55:36.460 --> 01:55:39.640
<v Speaker 5>Like I just want to regular mac book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pro keyboard on my laptop</v>

2507
01:55:39.810 --> 01:55:43.470

<v Speaker 1>but the thing about this thinkpad jammy,</v>

2508
01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:47.100
<v Speaker 1>the way the keys work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're typing on it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They feel like they're pressing the</v>

2512
01:55:57.960 --> 01:55:58.411
<v Speaker 1>press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>press,</v>

01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:32.620
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to set up a land party</v>

<v Speaker 5>in underground more than anyone.</v>

2529
01:56:43.011 --> 01:56:45.350
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have a limited amount of time,</v>

2530
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:47.540
<v Speaker 5>we go right back to quake.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happens?</v>

2531
01:56:47.590 --> 01:56:49.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like the.</v>

2532
01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:50.780
<v Speaker 5>If you like quake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll love this.</v>

2533
01:56:51.860 --> 01:56:54.680
<v Speaker 5>Champions game was this quick online</v>
<v Speaker 5>game.</v>

2534
01:56:54.810 --> 01:56:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Looks so crazy good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that it's all web based</v>

2535
01:56:58.711 --> 01:57:00.240
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on son.</v>

2536
01:57:00.350 --> 01:57:01.140
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2537
01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:03.390
<v Speaker 1>went away some time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on over man.</v>

2538
01:57:04.290 --> 01:57:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Folks and people up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring some people into a room.</v>

2539
01:57:07.230 --> 01:57:10.190
<v Speaker 5>You would be a championship gamer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't if you.</v>

2540
01:57:10.300 --> 01:57:13.350
<v Speaker 5>If you got into it and if you got into</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

2541
01:57:13.351 --> 01:57:16.200
<v Speaker 5>you would be like one of the top gamer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd be the ninja.</v>

2542
01:57:16.230 --> 01:57:17.063
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2543
01:57:17.490 --> 01:57:19.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm a not quite artistic enough</v>

2544
01:57:19.580 --> 01:57:22.200
<v Speaker 5>to get the top of the food chain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fat ass.</v>

2545
01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:26.280
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see the top guy when you say is the</v>

2546
01:57:26.281 --> 01:57:27.760
<v Speaker 5>top guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's one of my favorItes to watch.</v>

2547
01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:28.740
<v Speaker 5>He got drake on.</v>

2548
01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I think honestly that video games are</v>
<v Speaker 1>pro at high level,</v>

2549
01:57:34.801 --> 01:57:38.760
<v Speaker 1>especially quake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's deceptively intellectually</v>

2550
01:57:38.761 --> 01:57:40.290
<v Speaker 1>challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when they have these,</v>

2551
01:57:40.291 --> 01:57:42.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would do a lot of these,</v>

2552
01:57:42.031 --> 01:57:47.031
<v Speaker 1>one on one death matches and they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in a room and they would both spawn</v>

2553
01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.040
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to run,</v>

2554
01:57:50.041 --> 01:57:53.640
<v Speaker 1>you have to have knowledge of the map</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you also have to have knowledge of</v>

2555
01:57:53.641 --> 01:57:57.150
<v Speaker 1>when certain items are going to respond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you steal the rocket launcher,</v>

2556
01:57:57.630 --> 01:58:00.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another rocket launcher will respond and</v>

2557
01:58:00.121 --> 01:58:02.160
<v Speaker 1>like I forget how many seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 30 seconds.</v>

2558
01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:04.110
<v Speaker 1>So they would run the map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot the guy,</v>

2559
01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:08.460
<v Speaker 1>collect the extra rocket launch before</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can to keep him unarmed and keep</v>

2560
01:58:08.461 --> 01:58:10.860
<v Speaker 1>killing them over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after you kill them a certain amount</v>

2561
01:58:10.861 --> 01:58:11.880
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game is over.</v>

2562
01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:14.100
<v Speaker 1>And tHe guys who are really good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2563
01:58:14.101 --> 01:58:15.570
<v Speaker 1>we're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just really smart.</v>

2564
01:58:15.690 --> 01:58:17.520
<v Speaker 1>They're really smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fast.</v>

2565
01:58:17.521 --> 01:58:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Twitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super tuned into the game,</v>

2566
01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:23.100
<v Speaker 1>just like locked in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they studied those maps and</v>

2567
01:58:23.101 --> 01:58:27.090
<v Speaker 1>then they also study like movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could do crazy shit like rocket</v>

2568
01:58:27.091 --> 01:58:30.030
<v Speaker 1>jump onto people and do things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2569
01:58:30.090 --> 01:58:33.270
<v Speaker 1>like get to areas of the map just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they understood how to hop.</v>

2570
01:58:33.690 --> 01:58:36.010
<v Speaker 1>They could do it in a way that other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't know how to do that.</v>

2571
01:58:36.090 --> 01:58:39.000
<v Speaker 1>The guy ninja he's talking about is what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're describing.</v>

2572
01:58:39.001 --> 01:58:41.710
<v Speaker 1>So then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortnight you have to build these crazy.</v>

2573
01:58:41.711 --> 01:58:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Is this fortnight?</v>

2574
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:42.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be,</v>

2575
01:58:42.870 --> 01:58:45.630
<v Speaker 2>you find mats which are materials and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you billed for it.</v>

2576
01:58:45.631 --> 01:58:48.460
<v Speaker 2>So it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are one on one matches.</v>

2577
01:58:48.461 --> 01:58:52.330
<v Speaker 2>If you're playing solo where you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally build advantage.</v>

2578
01:58:52.331 --> 01:58:53.770
<v Speaker 2>You have to gain advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

2579
01:58:53.850 --> 01:58:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Why other bricks flying in the air?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gaining the materials.</v>

2580
01:58:56.611 --> 01:58:58.690
<v Speaker 2>So you're mining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

2581
01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:00.280
<v Speaker 2>And then that becomes what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>

2582
01:59:00.281 --> 01:59:03.490
<v Speaker 2>You have to like either you have only a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple guns you can choose from.</v>

2583
01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:07.950
<v Speaker 2>So how did this build this bridge here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's doing it that fast and he's.</v>

2584
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:10.240
<v Speaker 2>He knows there's a guy over there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to attack right now.</v>

2585
01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:12.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's his decision on how he does it</v>

2586
01:59:12.671 --> 01:59:16.960
<v Speaker 2>though and the map never changes really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just sort of changed through the</v>

2587
01:59:16.961 --> 01:59:20.050
<v Speaker 2>building to get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can build it back up.</v>

2588
01:59:20.051 --> 01:59:23.290
<v Speaker 2>I got a problem with this game because</v>
<v Speaker 2>to addictive,</v>

2589
01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:25.400
<v Speaker 2>addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just watching the addictions,</v>

2590
01:59:25.420 --> 01:59:30.010
<v Speaker 2>the colors to this game has gotten some</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy colors which is like crack for</v>

2591
01:59:30.011 --> 01:59:31.930
<v Speaker 2>your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is amazing.</v>

2592
01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:36.250
<v Speaker 2>And it's weird because grown adults just</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fallen in love with this overnight.</v>

2593
01:59:36.610 --> 01:59:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was joking around about video</v>

2594
01:59:39.401 --> 01:59:40.234
<v Speaker 2>games</v>

2595
01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:45.430
<v Speaker 1>that I'm not artistic enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the best guYs are going to be</v>

2596
01:59:45.561 --> 01:59:48.800
<v Speaker 1>considered like chess players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like kind of the same</v>

2597
01:59:48.801 --> 01:59:50.960
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just chest is traditionally</v>

2598
01:59:51.530 --> 01:59:54.230
<v Speaker 1>worshiped as this intellectual game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2599
01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:59.320
<v Speaker 1>But I think that a lot of video games</v>
<v Speaker 1>like starcraft for sure is like this</v>

2600
01:59:59.571 --> 02:00:03.650
<v Speaker 1>really high level strategy game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're doing things and you're</v>

2601
02:00:03.651 --> 02:00:07.220
<v Speaker 1>thinking on multiple levels about</v>
<v Speaker 1>different parts of the board and</v>

2602
02:00:07.221 --> 02:00:08.570
<v Speaker 1>different things that you're moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

2603
02:00:08.810 --> 02:00:11.990
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me to be like physically</v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic too because things are moving</v>

2604
02:00:11.991 --> 02:00:13.520
<v Speaker 1>quick like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not,</v>

2605
02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:16.820
<v Speaker 1>you're not in control of what your</v>
<v Speaker 1>opponent is doing while he's doing it.</v>

2606
02:00:16.821 --> 02:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>It's all happening in one time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You try to think your way through things</v>

2607
02:00:19.761 --> 02:00:22.340
<v Speaker 1>and put stuff here and move stuff there</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

2608
02:00:22.341 --> 02:00:25.250
<v Speaker 1>This were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we under appreciate them because when</v>

2609
02:00:25.251 --> 02:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>they first started out they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>frivolous like pong and stuff like that</v>

2610
02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:29.300
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2611
02:00:29.300 --> 02:00:29.930
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2612
02:00:29.930 --> 02:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2613
02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:31.220
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>

2614
02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:33.290
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we think of them as being dumb,</v>

2615
02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:37.640
<v Speaker 1>but they're so sophisticated now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids were making fucking shitloads of</v>

2616
02:00:37.641 --> 02:00:39.670
<v Speaker 1>money to who was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was saying that</v>

2617
02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:43.680
<v Speaker 2>he was saying that your kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you should parents should probably</v>

2618
02:00:43.681 --> 02:00:47.460
<v Speaker 2>encourage their kids to play games</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's fucking money in it.</v>

2619
02:00:47.461 --> 02:00:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2620
02:00:49.141 --> 02:00:51.690
<v Speaker 2>johnny caRson's old studio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been there probably a million</v>

2621
02:00:51.700 --> 02:00:53.190
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jay leno studio,</v>

2622
02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:56.020
<v Speaker 2>it's now a blizzard arena right down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>street from me.</v>

2623
02:00:56.030 --> 02:00:58.200
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's everyday they had to go there.</v>

2624
02:00:58.230 --> 02:01:00.990
<v Speaker 2>If you want to go check it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to go to right down the</v>

2625
02:01:00.991 --> 02:01:02.490
<v Speaker 2>street from me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2626
02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:06.750
<v Speaker 2>But it's a every time I drive by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just crowds of people like a sports</v>

2627
02:01:06.751 --> 02:01:07.440
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I want to play it because it reminds me</v>

2647
02:01:56.531 --> 02:01:57.820
<v Speaker 3>of the old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 3>games actually improve eyesight.</v>

2652
02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:15.800

<v Speaker 5>they were told us not to sit next close</v>

2653
02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:19.660

<v Speaker 5>the closest to a tv possibly made.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened to that?</v>

<v Speaker 5>Was a quake the one that they had the</v>

2661
02:02:39.831 --> 02:02:42.330
<v Speaker 5>space one where you just like trampoline</v>
<v Speaker 5>to over?</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2663
02:02:43.010 --> 02:02:44.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that was quick.</v>

2664
02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:45.930
<v Speaker 3>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had that they did that.</v>

2665
02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:49.080
<v Speaker 3>They had bouncy little things</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

2666
02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:53.070
<v Speaker 3>I came along at quick to um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't play a whole lot of quake one,</v>

2667
02:02:53.071 --> 02:02:56.610
<v Speaker 3>but quake one was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I played a little bit of it.</v>

2668
02:02:56.611 --> 02:02:59.370
<v Speaker 3>It was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quake one was um,</v>

2669
02:03:00.030 --> 02:03:03.750
<v Speaker 3>these like kind of blocky looking dudes</v>
<v Speaker 3>with helmets on.</v>

2670
02:03:03.751 --> 02:03:08.751
<v Speaker 3>They run around shooting each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was like real fast paced,</v>

2671
02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:13.050
<v Speaker 3>like unrealistically fast paced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it wasn't like this.</v>

2672
02:03:13.051 --> 02:03:14.670
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that some people like</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

2673
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:18.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it was like an army game.</v>

2675
02:03:21.930 --> 02:03:23.070
<v Speaker 3>Like counterstrike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2678
02:03:26.810 --> 02:03:28.950
<v Speaker 3>Love that game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things they loved about it</v>

2679
02:03:28.951 --> 02:03:30.970
<v Speaker 3>was that it had more realistic</v>

2680
02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:33.870
<v Speaker 5>physics</v>
<v Speaker 5>ticket.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2689
02:03:54.090 --> 02:03:57.770

<v Speaker 3>It's honestly,</v>

2690
02:03:57.771 --> 02:04:01.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure it's still the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>levels as back in whatever night.</v>

2691
02:04:02.010 --> 02:04:04.550
<v Speaker 3>They just have one item hd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is better.</v>

2692
02:04:04.690 --> 02:04:08.060
<v Speaker 3>This looks incredibly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This looks good.</v>

2693
02:04:08.410 --> 02:04:12.050
<v Speaker 3>We gotta get you guys' computers.</v>

<v Speaker 5>To see anything.</v>

2703
02:04:35.181 --> 02:04:37.500
<v Speaker 5>If you're curious about a new game,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just go to twitch and watch someone</v>

2704
02:04:37.501 --> 02:04:37.980
<v Speaker 5>playing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like</v>

2705
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:42.980
<v Speaker 2>a dude waiting for someone to play him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to go to sleep watching a girl</v>

2706
02:04:43.171 --> 02:04:47.340
<v Speaker 2>play some boring ass game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's people out there.</v>

2707
02:04:47.341 --> 02:04:51.420
<v Speaker 2>They're still into this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how crazy quake one was.</v>

2708
02:04:51.660 --> 02:04:53.790
<v Speaker 2>The graphics didn't even matter because</v>
<v Speaker 2>the game,</v>

2709
02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:58.820
<v Speaker 2>it was all dark and moody and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gameplay was so fun that a lot of people</v>

2710
02:04:59.161 --> 02:05:03.450
<v Speaker 2>even stayed with it after quake two and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then quake three became like sort of</v>

2711
02:05:03.451 --> 02:05:06.360
<v Speaker 2>fast paced like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you can find a video of people</v>

2712
02:05:06.361 --> 02:05:08.820
<v Speaker 2>playing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a comparison of the old one</v>

2713
02:05:08.821 --> 02:05:11.430
<v Speaker 2>versus the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Updated graphics.</v>

2714
02:05:12.550 --> 02:05:13.410
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2715
02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:16.460
<v Speaker 2>it was super blocky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the game that.</v>

2716
02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:18.420
<v Speaker 2>There was a mod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a mild,</v>

2717
02:05:18.450 --> 02:05:21.210
<v Speaker 2>but you're in the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in here hiding and toilets and on</v>

2718
02:05:21.211 --> 02:05:23.010
<v Speaker 2>toilet paper rolls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've already asked this,</v>

2719
02:05:23.011 --> 02:05:23.530
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2720
02:05:23.530 --> 02:05:23.810
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2721
02:05:23.810 --> 02:05:27.000
<v Speaker 2>I know talking about those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those rocket arena,</v>

2722
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:30.030
<v Speaker 2>there was like a rocket to read a map</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you could play quake and the</v>

2723
02:05:30.031 --> 02:05:34.320
<v Speaker 2>bathroom was my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've spent days on that.</v>

2724
02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a bunch of maps that people</v>

2725
02:05:36.031 --> 02:05:37.350
<v Speaker 2>would create,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2726
02:05:37.351 --> 02:05:40.440
<v Speaker 2>and there was even map making software</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you could,</v>

2727
02:05:40.530 --> 02:05:43.680
<v Speaker 2>you could make a bap and guys were</v>
<v Speaker 2>always doing it.</v>

2728
02:05:43.710 --> 02:05:45.360
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a really common thing.</v>

2729
02:05:45.361 --> 02:05:47.730
<v Speaker 2>There was a joe rogan level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember somebody made that.</v>

2730
02:05:48.210 --> 02:05:49.043
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the jre?</v>

2731
02:05:49.050 --> 02:05:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look a little logo.</v>

2732
02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:52.500
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think someone did do something like</v>

2733
02:05:52.501 --> 02:05:53.160
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that,</v>

2734
02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:56.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember they would do all these new</v>

2735
02:05:56.070 --> 02:05:59.250
<v Speaker 2>maps would come out and we would play</v>
<v Speaker 2>matches on these new maps.</v>

2736
02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:01.290
<v Speaker 2>You'd kick my ass till five in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>

2737
02:06:01.470 --> 02:06:02.310

2739
02:06:03.450 --> 02:06:06.750
<v Speaker 2>I had a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real problem with games,</v>

2740
02:06:07.580 --> 02:06:09.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing my best,</v>

2741
02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:13.110
<v Speaker 2>doing my best to avoid them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to indulge a little bit</v>

2742
02:06:13.111 --> 02:06:14.100
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Virtual reality,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's my.</v>

2744
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:18.540
<v Speaker 2>That's my favorite man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get an I love it.</v>

2745
02:06:18.541 --> 02:06:22.510
<v Speaker 2>And now you could play like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it doom or first person shooter?</v>

2746
02:06:22.511 --> 02:06:25.370
<v Speaker 2>I forget which one it assumes on there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and follow up for us on that.</v>

2747
02:06:25.371 --> 02:06:26.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You play doom.</v>

2748
02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:28.620
<v Speaker 2>Doom in vr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you show me that?</v>

2749
02:06:28.860 --> 02:06:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Show me doom in vr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which doom is it?</v>

2750
02:06:31.011 --> 02:06:33.280
<v Speaker 2>Is it the more recent tickets?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The original.</v>

2751
02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:34.760
<v Speaker 2>The original design?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably.</v>

2752
02:06:34.770 --> 02:06:37.500
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably like the cpu power</v>

2753
02:06:37.501 --> 02:06:40.500
<v Speaker 2>probably isn't able to keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to upgrade my age.</v>

2754
02:06:40.501 --> 02:06:43.560
<v Speaker 2>This is not the original one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an upgraded version of it.</v>

2755
02:06:43.650 --> 02:06:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it?</v>

2756
02:06:44.190 --> 02:06:46.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just upgraded graphics of this.</v>

2757
02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:48.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this does not look like this.</v>

2758
02:06:48.601 --> 02:06:52.260
<v Speaker 2>Looks like the newer ones took the</v>
<v Speaker 2>original doom and remade it remastered</v>

2759
02:06:52.261 --> 02:06:53.100
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is what it's called.</v>

2760
02:06:53.101 --> 02:06:55.520
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually bought this.</v>

2761
02:06:56.230 --> 02:06:59.130
<v Speaker 2>So this is doom vfr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a special vr version and I</v>

2762
02:06:59.131 --> 02:07:02.070
<v Speaker 2>think they might've have some levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's the actual full</v>

2763
02:07:02.071 --> 02:07:04.800
<v Speaker 2>game from start to finish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god dude.</v>

2764
02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.580
<v Speaker 2>But when you said it's the original</v>
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>

2765
02:07:08.581 --> 02:07:10.620
<v Speaker 2>I thought you meant like with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>original graphics,</v>

2766
02:07:10.621 --> 02:07:13.290
<v Speaker 2>these graphics are really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

2767
02:07:13.650 --> 02:07:16.980
<v Speaker 2>this will fuck your life up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said I could've brought it.</v>

2768
02:07:17.130 --> 02:07:19.440
<v Speaker 2>We should do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this right here to fuck your life up.</v>

2769
02:07:19.470 --> 02:07:21.370
<v Speaker 2>This looks way too fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have virtual reality.</v>

2770
02:07:21.380 --> 02:07:23.070
<v Speaker 2>You have virtual reality at your house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2771
02:07:23.240 --> 02:07:24.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to get her to go running.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Do things.</v>

2773
02:07:26.130 --> 02:07:27.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want them to do that anymore,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to make 1:30.</v>

2780
02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:51.610
<v Speaker 2>That's how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just just play video games all day.</v>

<v Speaker 2>which that looks.</v>

2784
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:03.810
<v Speaker 2>You want to see graphics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing graphics.</v>

2785
02:08:03.811 --> 02:08:05.740
<v Speaker 2>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw one in the commercial,</v>

2786
02:08:05.741 --> 02:08:06.980
<v Speaker 2>but it looks incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:11.290
<v Speaker 2>it's that and that's a real fun game.</v>

2788
02:08:11.360 --> 02:08:14.650
<v Speaker 2>but I like the color aspect.</v>

2815
02:09:24.980 --> 02:09:27.740
<v Speaker 2>This is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is real clunky.</v>

2816
02:09:27.741 --> 02:09:31.100
<v Speaker 2>Looking like it doesn't look real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it looks way realer than anything</v>

2817
02:09:31.101 --> 02:09:33.950
<v Speaker 2>I've ever seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is check this out.</v>

2818
02:09:33.951 --> 02:09:35.660
<v Speaker 2>This is actually like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>

2819
02:09:35.661 --> 02:09:40.010
<v Speaker 2>You're battling some of you guys trying</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kill you with that big rock.</v>

2820
02:09:40.030 --> 02:09:40.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2821
02:09:42.270 --> 02:09:45.160
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Games are amazing now.</v>

2822
02:09:45.420 --> 02:09:47.640
<v Speaker 2>shadows and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>

2823
02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what I'm saying is that like,</v>

2824
02:09:50.130 --> 02:09:54.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean this obviously looks amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in how many years do you think it</v>

2825
02:09:54.091 --> 02:09:55.710
<v Speaker 2>will be indistinguishable from real</v>
<v Speaker 2>life?</v>

2826
02:09:55.860 --> 02:09:57.030
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

2827
02:09:57.240 --> 02:09:58.200
<v Speaker 2>20 for short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2828
02:09:59.150 --> 02:10:03.420
<v Speaker 2>In 20 years you don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of skeptical on this a little bit</v>

2829
02:10:03.421 --> 02:10:05.880
<v Speaker 2>because I feel like the bar keeps</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting moved at five years,</v>

2830
02:10:05.881 --> 02:10:07.230
<v Speaker 2>10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every couple of years.</v>

2831
02:10:07.470 --> 02:10:09.330
<v Speaker 2>We get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get close skeptic over here.</v>

2832
02:10:09.450 --> 02:10:11.610
<v Speaker 2>We get close but it's still like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>window,</v>

2833
02:10:11.650 --> 02:10:12.840
<v Speaker 2>the window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get your first five.</v>

2834
02:10:12.930 --> 02:10:15.410
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been four or five years I've had or</v>

2835
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:19.200
<v Speaker 2>the oculus rift since beta testing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've had always had it and I just had</v>

2836
02:10:19.201 --> 02:10:23.040
<v Speaker 2>a big vr la thing this weekend and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't hear anyone sharing anything that</v>

2837
02:10:23.041 --> 02:10:27.150
<v Speaker 2>was like mind blowing experiences that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are making everyone go out and spend</v>

2838
02:10:27.151 --> 02:10:29.520
<v Speaker 2>$2,000 on a vr rig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2839
02:10:29.580 --> 02:10:33.950
<v Speaker 2>I Think right now what's happening is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the infancy of vr in a commercial level.</v>

2840
02:10:34.020 --> 02:10:35.270
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2841
02:10:35.271 --> 02:10:39.290
<v Speaker 1>it's like if you go back to the early</v>
<v Speaker 1>day at targhee boxes and then compare</v>

2842
02:10:39.291 --> 02:10:41.380
<v Speaker 1>them to a new xbox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2843
02:10:41.381 --> 02:10:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where we're looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just saying that it's not</v>

2844
02:10:43.521 --> 02:10:47.050
<v Speaker 1>happening quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those definitely happens.</v>

2845
02:10:47.090 --> 02:10:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Those are gigantic gaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can look at it from a different</v>

2846
02:10:49.941 --> 02:10:52.490
<v Speaker 1>perspective and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still just playing with the remote</v>

2847
02:10:52.491 --> 02:10:55.340
<v Speaker 1>control on a tv with some computer power</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind it.</v>

2848
02:10:55.550 --> 02:10:59.840
<v Speaker 1>And even those virtual stuff is also</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes connected to those three</v>

2849
02:10:59.841 --> 02:11:01.110
<v Speaker 1>dimensional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2850
02:11:01.470 --> 02:11:03.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those things that,</v>

2851
02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:06.440
<v Speaker 1>how do they call them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't call the treadmill,</v>

2852
02:11:06.441 --> 02:11:08.000
<v Speaker 1>what do they call them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>new track omnisphere.</v>

2853
02:11:08.600 --> 02:11:09.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing,</v>

2854
02:11:09.291 --> 02:11:10.160
<v Speaker 1>have you seen that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2855
02:11:10.370 --> 02:11:12.290
<v Speaker 1>you're strapped into the center of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and it moves.</v>

2856
02:11:12.291 --> 02:11:14.540
<v Speaker 1>The rest of you could walk through these</v>
<v Speaker 1>three d environments,</v>

2857
02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:16.760
<v Speaker 1>but you know if you.</v>

2858
02:11:16.760 --> 02:11:18.680
<v Speaker 1>But if I was gonna save just 20 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

2859
02:11:18.681 --> 02:11:22.880
<v Speaker 1>what kind of bullshit ass graphics were</v>
<v Speaker 1>we looking at and now look at what we're</v>

2860
02:11:22.881 --> 02:11:25.460
<v Speaker 1>looking at now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just 20 years from now they'll</v>

2861
02:11:25.461 --> 02:11:29.810
<v Speaker 1>probably have it like at the very least</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like watching marijuana or</v>

2862
02:11:29.811 --> 02:11:31.130
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I just still feel like it</v>

2863
02:11:31.131 --> 02:11:34.280
<v Speaker 1>was still feel super fake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will still know that this is still a big</v>

2864
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:37.490
<v Speaker 1>world and it's not going to ever get</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost in it pretty.</v>

2865
02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:40.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it's easy to get lost in it</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowadays.</v>

2866
02:11:40.251 --> 02:11:44.360
<v Speaker 1>They have big rooms almost like size of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chuck cheese where you renting out in so</v>

2867
02:11:44.361 --> 02:11:47.150
<v Speaker 1>you don't need a treadmill because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually going through obstacles</v>

2868
02:11:47.151 --> 02:11:50.180
<v Speaker 1>that are feel real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they would if they did it in a way</v>

2869
02:11:50.181 --> 02:11:52.930
<v Speaker 1>where it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2870
02:11:53.830 --> 02:11:56.420
<v Speaker 1>it's not realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really good.</v>

2871
02:11:57.050 --> 02:11:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what if they did despicable me?</v>

2872
02:11:59.810 --> 02:12:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Like you were in despicable me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the animated movie with the.</v>

2873
02:12:05.060 --> 02:12:07.970
<v Speaker 1>What's the dude's name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking bad guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know you're damaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2875
02:12:11.091 --> 02:12:14.000
<v Speaker 1>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the bad guy in the character's name?</v>

2876

<v Speaker 1>Is that his name?</v>

2877
02:12:16.710 --> 02:12:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any candy.</v>

2878
02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:20.870
<v Speaker 1>I have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the graphics are incredible.</v>

2879
02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:23.570
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's stunning to look at it like,</v>

2880
02:12:23.571 --> 02:12:25.820
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did an amazing job with this,</v>

2881
02:12:26.240 --> 02:12:29.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's obviously not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2882
02:12:29.001 --> 02:12:31.610
<v Speaker 1>You wanted to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that or like extra,</v>

2883
02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:35.510
<v Speaker 1>not just a simulation of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd want to be able to fly early,</v>

2884
02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:37.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump over fucking buildings.</v>

2885
02:12:37.880 --> 02:12:40.370
<v Speaker 1>You've gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've done the simpsons game right in</v>

2886
02:12:40.371 --> 02:12:43.070
<v Speaker 1>universal fucking incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2887
02:12:43.700 --> 02:12:45.820
<v Speaker 1>So good to ride the ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2889
02:12:46.270 --> 02:12:49.340
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ride where it's this huge video</v>

2890
02:12:49.341 --> 02:12:52.820
<v Speaker 1>screen and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your car moves up and down and they're</v>

2891
02:12:52.821 --> 02:12:55.940
<v Speaker 1>just taking you through this crazy thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're seeing in front of you and</v>

2892
02:12:55.941 --> 02:13:00.941
<v Speaker 1>it's probably as thrilling as any actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>ride where you're really moving.</v>

2893
02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the back of the future ride though?</v>

2894
02:13:03.080 --> 02:13:05.840
<v Speaker 1>Before that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that one because then 40</v>

2895
02:13:05.841 --> 02:13:08.000
<v Speaker 1>yet the 40 theaters out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2896
02:13:08.270 --> 02:13:09.590
<v Speaker 1>that's what you try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

2897
02:13:09.591 --> 02:13:13.130
<v Speaker 1>That's where you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing moves with the movie and</v>

2898
02:13:13.150 --> 02:13:16.940
<v Speaker 1>there's also smell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also missed and potter.</v>

2899
02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

2900
02:13:17.930 --> 02:13:20.360
<v Speaker 1>It looked like ivan pukey kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it like that?</v>

2901
02:13:20.361 --> 02:13:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Star wars ride star tours at disneyland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever done that?</v>

2902
02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like that.</v>

2903
02:13:25.580 --> 02:13:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moves and you could turn off like,</v>

2904
02:13:28.461 --> 02:13:30.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't want water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fart.</v>

2905
02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.580
<v Speaker 4>There will be something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I was trying to look it up</v>

2906
02:13:35.581 --> 02:13:37.500
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I remember steven spielberg talking</v>

2907
02:13:37.501 --> 02:13:42.501
<v Speaker 4>about developing a room type theater</v>
<v Speaker 4>process process.</v>

2908
02:13:42.721 --> 02:13:42.980
<v Speaker 4>We're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not.</v>

2909
02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:46.440
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you're not wearing anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but things are being projected into the</v>

2910
02:13:46.441 --> 02:13:49.440
<v Speaker 4>room you're in and you're experiencing</v>
<v Speaker 4>the movie like that.</v>

2911
02:13:49.441 --> 02:13:53.100
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe like avatar in the future</v>
<v Speaker 4>would be like 25 people jump into the</v>

2912
02:13:53.101 --> 02:13:56.700
<v Speaker 4>room and it starts playing and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>just experiencing it happen around you</v>

2913
02:13:56.970 --> 02:14:00.390
<v Speaker 4>versus wearing a headset and watching</v>
<v Speaker 4>something happen.</v>

2914
02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:03.860
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they've developed it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have seen some beautiful in</v>

2915
02:14:03.870 --> 02:14:04.591
<v Speaker 4>holograms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2916
02:14:04.591 --> 02:14:07.280
<v Speaker 4>Some big globe globes is happening in</v>
<v Speaker 4>vegas.</v>

2917
02:14:07.730 --> 02:14:08.960
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I Just told you about that.</v>

2918
02:14:09.070 --> 02:14:10.170
<v Speaker 4>Gm is doing something weird.</v>

2919
02:14:10.290 --> 02:14:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think group things are going to be</v>

2920
02:14:11.911 --> 02:14:15.060
<v Speaker 1>really interesting in that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody experiencing that in a</v>

2921
02:14:15.061 --> 02:14:18.150
<v Speaker 1>group the same way you experience like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie in a group,</v>

2922
02:14:18.450 --> 02:14:20.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible that they'll</v>

2923
02:14:20.041 --> 02:14:21.920
<v Speaker 1>develop something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2924
02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:25.950
<v Speaker 1>Where they'll have warehouses where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people meet up and everybody goes into</v>

2925
02:14:25.951 --> 02:14:29.640
<v Speaker 1>these virtual worlds together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you go on missions and shit,</v>

2926
02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:35.300
<v Speaker 1>just wear something that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tuned in to the wifi signal of the</v>

2927
02:14:36.271 --> 02:14:39.270
<v Speaker 1>building and you're wearing like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lightweight helmet,</v>

2928
02:14:39.271 --> 02:14:44.100
<v Speaker 1>like a bicycle helmet with straps on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not substance really cumbersome,</v>

2929
02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:47.370
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has enough battery life and enough</v>

2930
02:14:47.371 --> 02:14:49.360
<v Speaker 1>juice to get you through a one hour game</v>
<v Speaker 1>or</v>

2931
02:14:51.070 --> 02:14:54.410
<v Speaker 5>they have vr experiences where you can</v>
<v Speaker 5>go with your whole family and you're all</v>

2932
02:14:54.411 --> 02:14:56.220
<v Speaker 5>in the game wearing these things and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2933
02:14:56.350 --> 02:14:58.340
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in the game together.</v>

2934
02:14:58.370 --> 02:14:59.240
<v Speaker 5>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2935
02:14:59.570 --> 02:15:01.910
<v Speaker 5>What kind of games of any like virtual</v>
<v Speaker 5>reality games,</v>

2936
02:15:01.911 --> 02:15:04.130
<v Speaker 5>like they have the zombie game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2937
02:15:04.131 --> 02:15:05.900
<v Speaker 5>so you're running from zombies and a</v>
<v Speaker 5>warehouse.</v>

2938
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.690
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2939
02:15:06.690 --> 02:15:10.640
<v Speaker 5>I think I hold a link from a good</v>
<v Speaker 5>mythical morning.</v>

2940
02:15:10.670 --> 02:15:14.240
<v Speaker 5>He was talking about how he brought the</v>
<v Speaker 5>family and he was getting chased by</v>

2941
02:15:14.241 --> 02:15:16.740
<v Speaker 5>zombies and I had heard that there were</v>

2942
02:15:16.830 --> 02:15:18.330
<v Speaker 1>thinking about doing something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2943
02:15:18.331 --> 02:15:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Now that you think of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't know there was an actually</v>

2944
02:15:20.551 --> 02:15:21.390
<v Speaker 1>a place now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2945
02:15:21.700 --> 02:15:25.670
<v Speaker 5>And roller coaster before I feel like we</v>
<v Speaker 5>talked about in Utah.</v>

2946
02:15:25.671 --> 02:15:26.930
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2947
02:15:27.100 --> 02:15:28.100
<v Speaker 5>Remember looking it up right now.</v>

2948
02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2949
02:15:30.290 --> 02:15:32.750
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the future,</v>

2950
02:15:32.751 --> 02:15:36.860
<v Speaker 1>this is like you go to a football field</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like a virtual game is being</v>

2951
02:15:36.861 --> 02:15:38.150
<v Speaker 1>played,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2952
02:15:39.140 --> 02:15:42.140
<v Speaker 1>but then you've got to stop people from</v>
<v Speaker 1>like physically assaulting each other in</v>

2953
02:15:42.141 --> 02:15:43.070
<v Speaker 1>the virtual world.</v>

2954
02:15:43.370 --> 02:15:45.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to have a babysitter it anyway.</v>

2955
02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:45.630
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2956
02:15:45.630 --> 02:15:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Now remember this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd get off an elevator.</v>

2957
02:15:48.090 --> 02:15:50.200
<v Speaker 1>The future of virtual reality time</v>
<v Speaker 1>magazines</v>

2958
02:15:51.070 --> 02:15:53.550
<v Speaker 4>avoid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say if a ghostbusters experience</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're soaring and you feel like a light</v>
<v Speaker 1>breeze and there's different smells that</v>

<v Speaker 1>like the older one was soaring over</v>

3003
02:17:44.101 --> 02:17:46.500
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would look at this as bears like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was pretty amazing too.</v>

3012
02:18:00.631 --> 02:18:03.360

3013
02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:06.960
<v Speaker 1>He'd smell the water from the beach and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3014
02:18:06.980 --> 02:18:08.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3015
02:18:08.401 --> 02:18:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Like the water will splash in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your face.</v>

3016
02:18:10.081 --> 02:18:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden you're being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>paris or you'll be somewhere else.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I said it on an chair wrote on your</v>

3022
02:18:25.261 --> 02:18:28.290
<v Speaker 5>like it unbalanced would wear something</v>
<v Speaker 5>underneath it.</v>

3023
02:18:28.291 --> 02:18:30.180
<v Speaker 5>So it kind of rocks if you're standing</v>
<v Speaker 5>on it.</v>

3024
02:18:30.450 --> 02:18:33.630
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

02:18:33.631 --> 02:18:38.190
<v Speaker 5>reality road and I have a fan that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>turn on right when the elevator door</v>

3026
02:18:38.191 --> 02:18:42.180
<v Speaker 5>opens</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you feel like you're walking on the</v>

3027
02:18:42.181 --> 02:18:44.670
<v Speaker 5>side of the building,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like on this plank.</v>

<v Speaker 5>adapters.</v>

3044
02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:27.830
<v Speaker 5>You don't have all the cables anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A</v>

3045
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:31.220

<v Speaker 2>archery game ever have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those little monsters are trying to</v>

3047
02:19:34.431 --> 02:19:36.920
<v Speaker 2>attack the castle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you played arrows at them?</v>

3048
02:19:37.060 --> 02:19:40.250
<v Speaker 2>Vertical virtual pool is cool to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3049
02:19:40.370 --> 02:19:41.840
<v Speaker 2>because you have like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

02:19:41.841 --> 02:19:43.280
<v Speaker 2>you have controllers and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3051
02:19:43.350 --> 02:19:45.800

<v Speaker 2>You could play pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3053
02:19:47.721 --> 02:19:50.960
<v Speaker 2>But if you could only play virtual pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regular pool,</v>

3054
02:19:50.961 --> 02:19:53.040
<v Speaker 2>be so fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't to.</v>

3055
02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:55.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a real table.</v>

3056
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Look at the cloth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can feel it.</v>

3057
02:19:57.740 --> 02:19:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can watch the balls click together.</v>

3058
02:20:00.020 --> 02:20:02.630
<v Speaker 2>The real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real in front of me like,</v>

3059
02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:04.310
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather have a control where they're</v>

3060
02:20:04.311 --> 02:20:06.450
<v Speaker 2>pretends with my finger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to control what they're</v>

3061
02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:08.380
<v Speaker 2>pretended to stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3062
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:10.620
<v Speaker 2>but you could also be playing it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>moon,</v>

3063
02:20:10.670 --> 02:20:14.720
<v Speaker 2>on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't be playing on the men in your tiny</v>

3064
02:20:14.721 --> 02:20:16.460
<v Speaker 2>little apartment where you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>space for a table.</v>

3065
02:20:16.900 --> 02:20:19.310
<v Speaker 2>That's true too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3066
02:20:19.311 --> 02:20:21.530
<v Speaker 2>There's video games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can play a two on your phone,</v>

3067
02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:24.650
<v Speaker 2>but I've never even thought about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>critically.</v>

3068
02:20:25.230 --> 02:20:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Kate quigley's and she's in a virtual</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality porn.</v>

3069
02:20:30.020 --> 02:20:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not naked and she's sitting there,</v>

3070
02:20:32.241 --> 02:20:35.810
<v Speaker 2>but she's getting molested by a naked</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl and it's weird because when you're</v>

3071
02:20:35.811 --> 02:20:38.250
<v Speaker 2>in the virtual rail road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your kate quigley.</v>

3072
02:20:38.780 --> 02:20:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are her.</v>

3073
02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:44.700
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird because I had a side gig.</v>

3074
02:20:49.950 --> 02:20:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For her,</v>

3075
02:20:53.180 --> 02:20:55.670
<v Speaker 2>that's a virtual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Porn has got to be a big market.</v>

3076
02:20:55.900 --> 02:20:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not as good as I was hoping for.</v>

3077
02:20:58.610 --> 02:20:59.480
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3078
02:20:59.640 --> 02:21:01.790
<v Speaker 2>that was weird about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like in your head,</v>

3079
02:21:01.791 --> 02:21:02.980
<v Speaker 2>you think it's going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3080
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:06.110
<v Speaker 2>this is realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to make masturbating way mit</v>

3081
02:21:06.111 --> 02:21:08.720
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still clunky because all the</v>

3082
02:21:08.721 --> 02:21:10.850
<v Speaker 2>companies that make virtual reality</v>
<v Speaker 2>porn,</v>

3083
02:21:10.851 --> 02:21:15.851
<v Speaker 2>they're not making like perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>masterpiece is they're still filming it.</v>

3084
02:21:16.250 --> 02:21:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Sloppy and edited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sloppy damage for the most part.</v>

3085
02:21:19.460 --> 02:21:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless I haven't seen all of it,</v>

3086
02:21:21.230 --> 02:21:25.610
<v Speaker 2>but this is just a setup for brian's new</v>

<v Speaker 2>That seems like pretty doable.</v>

3103
02:22:01.430 --> 02:22:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I just got a little cynical view</v>

3104
02:22:03.771 --> 02:22:04.660
<v Speaker 2>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like maybe,</v>

<v Speaker 2>maybe not super cynical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jamie.</v>

3109
02:22:14.190 --> 02:22:16.400

<v Speaker 2>internet,</v>

02:22:16.430 --> 02:22:19.650
<v Speaker 2>like when.</v>

<v Speaker 5>rooms to hang out together.</v>

3118
02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:41.370
<v Speaker 5>Talk to the musicians that are just sit</v>
<v Speaker 5>there and play songs for you,</v>

3119
02:22:41.371 --> 02:22:45.870

<v Speaker 5>it's here,</v>

3121
02:22:47.370 --> 02:22:50.130

<v Speaker 5>stuff like that.</v>

3122
02:22:50.131 --> 02:22:50.964
<v Speaker 5>Some people just.</v>

3123
02:22:52.140 --> 02:22:54.120
<v Speaker 3>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my name is missy.</v>

3124
02:22:54.530 --> 02:22:58.590
<v Speaker 3>A lot of racist people on there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you leave people alone,</v>

3125
02:22:58.591 --> 02:23:02.850
<v Speaker 3>they just become racist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You give them notes,</v>

3126
02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:06.060
<v Speaker 3>those schooling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know the way and put them inside</v>

3127
02:23:06.061 --> 02:23:08.700
<v Speaker 3>of a video game with no repercussions</v>
<v Speaker 3>for their actions.</v>

3128
02:23:09.360 --> 02:23:11.760
<v Speaker 3>That's the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you could be like a little</v>

3129
02:23:11.761 --> 02:23:14.400
<v Speaker 3>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say terrible and words.</v>

3130
02:23:15.010 --> 02:23:16.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little.</v>

3131
02:23:16.791 --> 02:23:21.410
<v Speaker 3>A blonde girl on the screen for me while</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a 40 year old man from the bronx.</v>

3132
02:23:22.440 --> 02:23:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Probably didn't check it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the instagram update yesterday said</v>

3133
02:23:24.841 --> 02:23:29.841
<v Speaker 3>something about they're blocking words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bullies like that as well.</v>

3134
02:23:30.300 --> 02:23:33.540
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what other people are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>assholes with that man.</v>

3135
02:23:34.800 --> 02:23:38.130
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assholes with the being mean to people</v>

3136
02:23:38.131 --> 02:23:40.290
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a new toy.</v>

3137
02:23:40.700 --> 02:23:44.010
<v Speaker 3>We don't to do it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also revealing a lot of people that</v>

3138
02:23:44.011 --> 02:23:46.230
<v Speaker 3>you didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of people that you never got</v>

3139
02:23:46.231 --> 02:23:48.900
<v Speaker 3>in contact with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just really shitty people mean.</v>

3140
02:23:49.170 --> 02:23:53.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm only mean to companies like I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've switched to my online bullying to</v>

3141
02:23:53.670 --> 02:23:58.670
<v Speaker 3>only talking about bad services service</v>
<v Speaker 3>at restaurants or delivery service.</v>

3142
02:23:58.790 --> 02:24:03.630
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if it's warranted.</v>

3143
02:24:04.320 --> 02:24:05.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I say,</v>

3144
02:24:05.521 --> 02:24:08.420
<v Speaker 5>but people get mad at me for like when I</v>
<v Speaker 5>posted those things.</v>

3145
02:24:08.430 --> 02:24:10.380
<v Speaker 5>I can put some of the other day at this</v>
<v Speaker 5>chicken place.</v>

3146
02:24:10.440 --> 02:24:13.770
<v Speaker 5>They burned everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They sent me like everything.</v>

3147
02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:16.440
<v Speaker 5>Like the corn on the cob was black.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That chicken was black.</v>

3148
02:24:16.590 --> 02:24:18.870
<v Speaker 5>I had to throw it away and I was late</v>
<v Speaker 5>too.</v>

3149
02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:24.250
<v Speaker 3>Be the chef and the lady working of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>counter and they weren't paying</v>

3150
02:24:24.251 --> 02:24:25.090
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eat chicken.</v>

3151
02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:28.220
<v Speaker 3>It's probably some 14 year old kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frequent problem.</v>

3152
02:24:28.390 --> 02:24:29.420
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3153
02:24:29.421 --> 02:24:30.850
<v Speaker 3>Probably some kid who wasn't paying</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>

3154
02:24:31.150 --> 02:24:36.150
<v Speaker 3>I just had a good fantasy of what was</v>
<v Speaker 3>really happening.</v>

3155
02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:40.730
<v Speaker 3>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fucked in a frigerator of restaurant.</v>

02:24:41.140 --> 02:24:45.320
<v Speaker 3>Hey houlihan's easy fella.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>newport creamery with me.</v>

3159
02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:51.670
<v Speaker 3>What's that like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

3160
02:24:51.670 --> 02:24:54.880
<v Speaker 3>like a cold stone ice cream place that</v>
<v Speaker 3>served hamburgers.</v>

3161
02:24:57.100 --> 02:24:58.240
<v Speaker 3>Who's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember me.</v>

3162
02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:01.000
<v Speaker 3>It's me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This fucking phone.</v>

3163
02:25:01.330 --> 02:25:04.150
<v Speaker 3>I've got a phone that for whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>reason,</v>

3164
02:25:04.180 --> 02:25:06.170
<v Speaker 3>turns itself on to ring all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3165
02:25:06.370 --> 02:25:08.860
<v Speaker 3>Like even when I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns the cell phone to ring.</v>

3166
02:25:09.220 --> 02:25:10.053
<v Speaker 3>It's done it like twice.</v>

3167
02:25:10.140 --> 02:25:11.250
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's this case,</v>

3168
02:25:11.251 --> 02:25:14.490
<v Speaker 5>this leather apple case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a piece of shit.</v>

3169
02:25:14.510 --> 02:25:17.490
<v Speaker 5>Like look at your volume buttons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at mine.</v>

3170
02:25:17.550 --> 02:25:21.870
<v Speaker 5>They're sunk in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this suddenly had this like a for a</v>

3171
02:25:21.870 --> 02:25:24.030
<v Speaker 5>week and it's already falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>None not</v>

3172
02:25:24.120 --> 02:25:26.230
<v Speaker 1>join it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overheats your phone.</v>

3173
02:25:26.290 --> 02:25:28.990
<v Speaker 1>I think because of the leather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way for the air to get out.</v>

3174
02:25:28.991 --> 02:25:31.210
<v Speaker 1>So my shit's running slower than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>should.</v>

3175
02:25:31.420 --> 02:25:33.580
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put a battery pack on this.</v>

3176
02:25:33.581 --> 02:25:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Like a madman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A?</v>

3177
02:25:34.770 --> 02:25:35.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3178
02:25:35.610 --> 02:25:39.260
<v Speaker 1>put one of them thick ass battery packs</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it felt like a superhero.</v>

3179
02:25:39.340 --> 02:25:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I could just go all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you have it on now?</v>

3180
02:25:43.210 --> 02:25:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Because I took it off because I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it was relying on it too much.</v>

3181
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:51.950
<v Speaker 1>I should just charge it at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm using my phone less and less after</v>

3182
02:25:52.091 --> 02:25:56.020
<v Speaker 1>my trip to Hawaii because my phone broke</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dropped it the first day there and I</v>

3183
02:25:56.021 --> 02:25:56.920
<v Speaker 1>had to order a new one.</v>

3184
02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean mine to stop working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing?</v>

3185
02:26:00.310 --> 02:26:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duty would just randomly call people.</v>

3186
02:26:02.170 --> 02:26:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I would hold up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would hold up my contacts and it would</v>

3187
02:26:06.671 --> 02:26:10.600
<v Speaker 1>just start calling people and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would hang up and it would start calling</v>

3188
02:26:10.601 --> 02:26:11.350
<v Speaker 1>another person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3189
02:26:11.350 --> 02:26:13.150
<v Speaker 1>hang up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was dark and I was showing people.</v>

3190
02:26:13.151 --> 02:26:14.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like my friend John Dudley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3191
02:26:14.680 --> 02:26:18.040
<v Speaker 1>watch this watch was doing and then I'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>hang up and we'll do that again.</v>

3192
02:26:18.041 --> 02:26:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

3193
02:26:18.940 --> 02:26:21.190
<v Speaker 1>I just dropped it and just went haywire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

3194
02:26:21.191 --> 02:26:22.024
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I broke it.</v>

3195
02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:22.983
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3196
02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:26.380
<v Speaker 1>when I got a new one for three days I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't doing anything.</v>

3197
02:26:26.590 --> 02:26:28.390
<v Speaker 1>So for three days waiting for my phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come,</v>

3198
02:26:28.420 --> 02:26:30.400
<v Speaker 1>I didn't use any apps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

3199
02:26:30.401 --> 02:26:32.350
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I felt better.</v>

3200
02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:35.110
<v Speaker 1>I felt better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're in Hawaii?</v>

<v Speaker 1>luxury suv family wagon market is a</v>

3244
02:28:16.751 --> 02:28:19.900
<v Speaker 1>weird market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's range rovers and there's a</v>

02:28:19.901 --> 02:28:24.901
<v Speaker 1>bunch of mercedes suv and bmw suv,</v>

02:28:25.971 --> 02:28:29.330
<v Speaker 1>the cadillac escalade kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this was like another level,</v>

3252
02:28:45.141 --> 02:28:48.650
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a dashboard.</v>

3416
02:36:44.330 --> 02:36:46.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm just wondering what's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next thing that people,</v>

3417
02:36:46.880 --> 02:36:51.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like instagram seems to be like a that's</v>

3418
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.940
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a platform.</v>

3419
02:36:52.941 --> 02:36:55.220
<v Speaker 1>People like they like pictures and text</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the pictures,</v>

3420
02:36:55.221 --> 02:36:56.540
<v Speaker 1>but like what is going to be the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

3421
02:36:56.780 --> 02:36:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to be some sort of augmented</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

3422
02:36:59.210 --> 02:37:03.650
<v Speaker 1>some virtual thing or some goggles thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's got to be something that's going</v>

3423
02:37:03.651 --> 02:37:07.190
<v Speaker 1>to be something in another space other</v>
<v Speaker 1>than just your phone.</v>

3424
02:37:08.330 --> 02:37:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I really think that there's gonna come a</v>
<v Speaker 1>time where the same amount of time that</v>

3425
02:37:12.171 --> 02:37:15.140
<v Speaker 1>people spend on social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to spend some sort an</v>

3426
02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:18.470
<v Speaker 1>augmented state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you'll be able to wear these things</v>

3427
02:37:18.471 --> 02:37:21.800
<v Speaker 1>for work because they help you pull</v>
<v Speaker 1>things up so people just accept.</v>

3428
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:24.470
<v Speaker 1>I have to have my goggles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody wears goggles at a</v>

3429
02:37:24.471 --> 02:37:26.270
<v Speaker 1>certain point in time because it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much cooler.</v>

02:37:26.750 --> 02:37:29.480
<v Speaker 1>It adjusts for vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you perfect vision.</v>

3431
02:37:29.890 --> 02:37:31.600
<v Speaker 4>That black mirror episode about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>human,</v>

3432
02:37:31.630 --> 02:37:34.210
<v Speaker 4>the dvr when everyone can record,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yes,</v>

3433
02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:36.190
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean so many other black mirror things</v>

3434
02:37:36.191 --> 02:37:40.300
<v Speaker 4>have sort of been coming true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That seems like the most realistic one</v>

3435
02:37:40.301 --> 02:37:41.290
<v Speaker 4>that might happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

3436
02:37:41.870 --> 02:37:43.070
<v Speaker 1>Recording memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3437
02:37:43.071 --> 02:37:44.060
<v Speaker 1>probably someday.</v>

3438
02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:46.290
<v Speaker 4>I think they're close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw an article recently.</v>

3439
02:37:46.291 --> 02:37:51.210
<v Speaker 4>They're close to being able to either</v>
<v Speaker 4>record your dreams and play them back</v>

3440
02:37:51.211 --> 02:37:54.090
<v Speaker 4>for you or reinterpret them after you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>awake,</v>

3441
02:37:54.091 --> 02:37:57.810
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's record them as you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleeping and kind of find out what you</v>

3442
02:37:57.811 --> 02:37:59.370
<v Speaker 4>were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe rewatch it or something.</v>

3443
02:37:59.430 --> 02:38:02.550
<v Speaker 4>I hope not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if the shits in high def if like</v>

3444
02:38:02.750 --> 02:38:03.583
<v Speaker 4>falling</v>

3445
02:38:03.730 --> 02:38:08.140
<v Speaker 1>buildings in high def</v>
<v Speaker 1>demons or barking at you?</v>

3446
02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:11.233
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>

3447
02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:13.880
<v Speaker 4>I had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever out of nowhere just have a</v>

3448
02:38:13.881 --> 02:38:16.520
<v Speaker 4>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like embarrassed that you even</v>

3449
02:38:16.521 --> 02:38:19.550
<v Speaker 4>thought that even though you had no</v>
<v Speaker 4>control of it.</v>

3450
02:38:19.850 --> 02:38:22.920
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them theoretically recording</v>
<v Speaker 1>dreams is possible.</v>

3451
02:38:22.950 --> 02:38:27.310
<v Speaker 1>Scientists are trying to cover magazine</v>
<v Speaker 1>march.</v>

3452
02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Of course it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just got to figure out how to get</v>

3453
02:38:30.841 --> 02:38:34.710
<v Speaker 1>into the door with eventually if people</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive,</v>

3454
02:38:35.190 --> 02:38:39.900
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have with every</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation a greater greater</v>

3455
02:38:39.901 --> 02:38:42.240
<v Speaker 1>understanding of how to manipulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>things around them.</v>

3456
02:38:42.570 --> 02:38:47.040
<v Speaker 1>It's just what people strive for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Strive for manipulating the environment,</v>

3457
02:38:47.190 --> 02:38:52.190
<v Speaker 1>manipulating electrical currents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulating concrete,</v>

3458
02:38:52.951 --> 02:38:56.160
<v Speaker 1>moving things around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaping things that we just keep getting</v>

3459
02:38:56.161 --> 02:38:57.870
<v Speaker 1>better and better and better at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

3460
02:38:57.871 --> 02:39:02.800
<v Speaker 1>we're going to keep getting better and</v>
<v Speaker 1>better at it technologically to can I</v>

3461
02:39:02.801 --> 02:39:04.440
<v Speaker 1>have some crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3462
02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:09.420
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to wonder why we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to all be stuck.</v>

3463
02:39:10.220 --> 02:39:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Some strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird matrix like environment we're</v>

3464
02:39:15.031 --> 02:39:17.490
<v Speaker 1>already are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it easily could be</v>

3465
02:39:17.491 --> 02:39:20.040
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily like right now,</v>

3466
02:39:20.041 --> 02:39:23.190
<v Speaker 1>but on the way to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's the logical conclusion?</v>

3467
02:39:23.190 --> 02:39:27.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean is does anybody believe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people at this point are going to back</v>

3468
02:39:27.241 --> 02:39:28.590
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That they're going to go,</v>

3469
02:39:28.591 --> 02:39:30.130
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

3470
02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:32.250
<v Speaker 1>This technology is just getting too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>into our lives.</v>

3471
02:39:32.310 --> 02:39:35.070
<v Speaker 1>We went to a restaurant last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dad was on his phone.</v>

3472
02:39:35.790 --> 02:39:38.730
<v Speaker 1>This kid's got a 12 inch ipad propped up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of them.</v>

3473
02:39:39.030 --> 02:39:42.420
<v Speaker 1>The other kid on the other side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>table has a 12 inch ipad propped up in</v>

3474
02:39:42.421 --> 02:39:46.860
<v Speaker 1>front of him and they're just watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>three different things and no one's</v>

3475
02:39:46.861 --> 02:39:49.560
<v Speaker 1>talking to each other and they're there</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a sushi joint.</v>

3476
02:39:49.650 --> 02:39:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

3477
02:39:50.851 --> 02:39:52.770
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what people do.</v>

3478
02:39:53.430 --> 02:39:56.610
<v Speaker 1>They get together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put a show on in front of the kid,</v>

3479
02:39:56.611 --> 02:39:57.444
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

3480
02:39:57.540 --> 02:40:02.220
<v Speaker 1>And they just the entire time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even like the parents are done,</v>

3481
02:40:02.221 --> 02:40:03.890
<v Speaker 1>they want to talk and can I use your</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

3482
02:40:03.900 --> 02:40:04.320
<v Speaker 1>your head?</v>

3483
02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:05.670
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and use my phone and play a</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

3484
02:40:05.820 --> 02:40:07.830
<v Speaker 1>The kids playing in the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody talking to somebody?</v>

3485
02:40:07.860 --> 02:40:10.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's talking to anybody.</v>

3486
02:40:10.740 --> 02:40:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An electronic device.</v>

3487
02:40:12.690 --> 02:40:16.020
<v Speaker 1>You go to public place and they sit down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then not interacting with each</v>

3488
02:40:16.021 --> 02:40:17.730
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is super normal,</v>

3489
02:40:17.731 --> 02:40:19.200
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look around,</v>

3490
02:40:19.201 --> 02:40:21.380
<v Speaker 1>it's super normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super normal,</v>

3491
02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:24.210
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to wonder about that in a</v>

3492
02:40:24.210 --> 02:40:26.430
<v Speaker 1>few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to wonder like how do they</v>

3493
02:40:26.431 --> 02:40:28.290
<v Speaker 1>let that in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they lead this?</v>

3494
02:40:28.291 --> 02:40:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Like I was watching these little kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3495
02:40:30.210 --> 02:40:31.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be a judge parent,</v>

3496
02:40:33.630 --> 02:40:35.700
<v Speaker 1>but just I'm just looking at it like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>

3497
02:40:36.150 --> 02:40:40.740
<v Speaker 1>How much less time are they spending</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to people now,</v>

3498
02:40:41.070 --> 02:40:44.700
<v Speaker 1>how many less awkward moments at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner table we had a workout.</v>

3499
02:40:44.701 --> 02:40:49.701
<v Speaker 1>Just controlling your temper or</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling your emotions are</v>

3500
02:40:50.041 --> 02:40:53.250
<v Speaker 1>controlling the way you interact with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people or trying to be nicer about some</v>

3501
02:40:53.251 --> 02:40:55.370
<v Speaker 1>of the ways you say things and learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get that.</v>

3502
02:40:55.510 --> 02:40:58.320
<v Speaker 1>The only way people learn about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff is at a dinner table,</v>

3503
02:40:58.350 --> 02:40:59.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk to each other.</v>

3504
02:40:59.820 --> 02:41:03.150
<v Speaker 1>That's part of like how people learn to</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with each other,</v>

3505
02:41:03.151 --> 02:41:04.620
<v Speaker 1>sitting down at dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3506
02:41:05.190 --> 02:41:07.440
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden everyone's like watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>a screen.</v>

3507
02:41:08.250 --> 02:41:10.140
<v Speaker 1>How much less time are we spending</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking</v>

3508
02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:16.640
<v Speaker 1>like how much shittier are people going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be if they continue doing that at</v>

3509
02:41:16.990 --> 02:41:19.980
<v Speaker 1>talking to real people and is that an</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue?</v>

3510
02:41:23.030 --> 02:41:26.450
<v Speaker 5>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think people don't have as strong as</v>

3511
02:41:26.451 --> 02:41:30.010
<v Speaker 5>compassion with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like as much as much compassion and then</v>

3512
02:41:30.011 --> 02:41:33.110
<v Speaker 5>mike value human life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why there's more school shooters</v>

3513
02:41:33.111 --> 02:41:36.200
<v Speaker 5>and and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the realness of it.</v>

3514
02:41:36.201 --> 02:41:38.930
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of getting faded,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3515
02:41:38.931 --> 02:41:43.931
<v Speaker 5>death is way more in your eyes nowadays</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a kid than it was when we were young.</v>

3516
02:41:44.301 --> 02:41:45.500
<v Speaker 5>We were just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3517
02:41:45.750 --> 02:41:48.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>playing with frogs and playing cops and</v>

3518
02:41:48.711 --> 02:41:51.080
<v Speaker 5>robbers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We didn't have internet to see death.</v>

3519
02:41:51.081 --> 02:41:54.380
<v Speaker 5>We didn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tv wasn't about death at the time.</v>

3520
02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:55.690
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a video.</v>

3521
02:41:55.790 --> 02:42:00.200
<v Speaker 5>Video games is all death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean you have lives in video games</v>

3522
02:42:00.330 --> 02:42:01.163
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when was the,</v>

3523
02:42:01.250 --> 02:42:03.830
<v Speaker 5>you have lives when you're a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3524
02:42:03.870 --> 02:42:06.110
<v Speaker 5>the cats had that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a good point,</v>

3525
02:42:06.111 --> 02:42:06.450
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3526
02:42:06.450 --> 02:42:09.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean especially how much you could see</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the internet,</v>

3527
02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:12.750
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of horrible shit that people</v>

3528
02:42:12.751 --> 02:42:15.540
<v Speaker 1>see on a daily basis on the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people will tell me,</v>

3529
02:42:15.541 --> 02:42:16.440
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to see this video?</v>

3530
02:42:16.441 --> 02:42:17.274
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3531
02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:20.040
<v Speaker 1>I've seen enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what people are capable of.</v>

3532
02:42:20.041 --> 02:42:20.874
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

3533
02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:24.510
<v Speaker 5>Some people not though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people all day watching fucked up</v>

<v Speaker 5>don't,</v>

3536
02:42:26.170 --> 02:42:29.400
<v Speaker 5>don't start with cable though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember how it started with</v>

3537
02:42:29.401 --> 02:42:31.620
<v Speaker 5>cable and when we were an older.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wasn't old enough but</v>

3538
02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:34.230
<v Speaker 1>sorta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really started with videotape.</v>

3539
02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like faces of death and shit like that.</v>

3540
02:42:37.301 --> 02:42:40.510
<v Speaker 1>You started seeing the face of death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the video a friend of mine</v>

3541
02:42:40.511 --> 02:42:44.410
<v Speaker 1>sent me was a girl walking towards the</v>
<v Speaker 1>train.</v>

3542
02:42:44.411 --> 02:42:48.520
<v Speaker 1>She's not paying attention and she gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>nailed by the train and it's fucking</v>

3543
02:42:48.521 --> 02:42:51.160
<v Speaker 1>horrific man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just gets torn apart.</v>

3544
02:42:51.161 --> 02:42:53.320
<v Speaker 1>You watch and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god.</v>

3545
02:42:53.740 --> 02:42:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to watch.</v>

3546
02:42:55.450 --> 02:42:57.430
<v Speaker 5>I used to always talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what was,</v>

3547
02:42:57.431 --> 02:43:00.220
<v Speaker 5>it was definitely faces of death and it</v>
<v Speaker 5>was definitely ufc one,</v>

3548
02:43:00.221 --> 02:43:01.360
<v Speaker 5>two and three,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3549
02:43:01.361 --> 02:43:06.060
<v Speaker 5>like the early days of ufc seeing mixed</v>
<v Speaker 5>matched like people go at it and just</v>

3550
02:43:06.100 --> 02:43:09.640
<v Speaker 5>the brutal kaos you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and there was no rules back then.</v>

3551
02:43:09.641 --> 02:43:12.030
<v Speaker 5>It was just like death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're.</v>

3552
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:15.250
<v Speaker 3>There wasn't very many rules like you</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't eye gouge where you could punch</v>

3553
02:43:15.251 --> 02:43:16.150
<v Speaker 3>in the nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3554
02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:19.480
<v Speaker 3>And you never saw that before it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>boxing on tv.</v>

3555
02:43:19.481 --> 02:43:20.710
<v Speaker 3>It was never like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

3556
02:43:20.711 --> 02:43:25.711
<v Speaker 3>these guys are fighting like dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dirty fighting and pulling hair and not</v>

3557
02:43:26.951 --> 02:43:28.260
<v Speaker 3>punching shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3558
02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:32.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's probably true too.</v>

3559
02:43:32.111 --> 02:43:34.570
<v Speaker 3>I think our appetite for stimulation is</v>
<v Speaker 3>increasing.</v>

3560
02:43:35.110 --> 02:43:38.110
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think for real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why people like so many</v>

3561
02:43:38.111 --> 02:43:40.540
<v Speaker 3>thrilling things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're developing a stronger and</v>

3562
02:43:40.541 --> 02:43:44.080
<v Speaker 3>stronger appetite for stimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think it is,</v>

3563
02:43:44.081 --> 02:43:46.960
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And and I think the internet and you</v>

3564
02:43:46.961 --> 02:43:48.220
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just so many different things you could</v>

3565
02:43:48.221 --> 02:43:51.040
<v Speaker 3>see like how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how was it the weekend like</v>

3566
02:43:51.041 --> 02:43:55.450
<v Speaker 3>instantaneously pull up video of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>volcano eating a car.</v>

3567
02:43:56.260 --> 02:43:57.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3568
02:43:57.910 --> 02:43:59.290
<v Speaker 3>how many people are supposed to see</v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

3569
02:43:59.590 --> 02:44:01.660
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to see that shit all</v>

3570
02:44:01.660 --> 02:44:05.200
<v Speaker 3>day from all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not supposed to see all these</v>

3571
02:44:05.201 --> 02:44:09.130
<v Speaker 3>different volcano eruptions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>different shootings and cars running</v>

3572
02:44:09.131 --> 02:44:11.590
<v Speaker 3>over people in times square and all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit.</v>

3573
02:44:11.650 --> 02:44:14.250
<v Speaker 3>If he lived in Kansas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lava shouldn't really be.</v>

3574
02:44:14.340 --> 02:44:15.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be on your list of shit.</v>

3575
02:44:15.880 --> 02:44:18.130
<v Speaker 3>You got a small amount of things to</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about in front of you.</v>

3576
02:44:18.860 --> 02:44:20.980
<v Speaker 3>You could live forever at each</v>
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

3577
02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Everything's flat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You shouldn't be worried about lava</v>

3578
02:44:24.700 --> 02:44:27.760
<v Speaker 3>should you wish you should have some</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking lava to mix things up.</v>

3579
02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:32.620
<v Speaker 3>That's gotta be a weird place to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3580
02:44:32.621 --> 02:44:35.950
<v Speaker 3>When you're watching that earth crack</v>
<v Speaker 3>open and you realize how thin the crust</v>

3581
02:44:35.951 --> 02:44:38.800
<v Speaker 3>is between you and the most insane shit</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

3582
02:44:39.400 --> 02:44:44.400
<v Speaker 3>Rivers of hot molten rock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right under the surface of the ground.</v>

3583
02:44:47.021 --> 02:44:48.790
<v Speaker 3>You're walking on like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3584
02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:52.390
<v Speaker 3>How much is down there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did we camp out here?</v>

3585
02:44:54.040 --> 02:44:55.780
<v Speaker 3>I get paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still at earthquakes.</v>

3586
02:44:55.781 --> 02:44:57.910
<v Speaker 3>I was in the belly room at the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>store the other day,</v>

3587
02:44:57.911 --> 02:44:59.170
<v Speaker 3>packed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3588
02:44:59.610 --> 02:45:01.330
<v Speaker 3>And if it was just like the big</v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquake,</v>

3589
02:45:01.331 --> 02:45:03.280
<v Speaker 3>then we would all be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was too many people.</v>

3590
02:45:03.281 --> 02:45:05.860
<v Speaker 3>There would be no escape this one place</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know what I mean?</v>

3591
02:45:05.861 --> 02:45:07.180
<v Speaker 3>But I got that in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3592
02:45:07.210 --> 02:45:08.290
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get outta here.</v>

3593
02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:12.760
<v Speaker 3>So terrible thing to think of a building</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it starts collapsing or any parking</v>

3594
02:45:12.770 --> 02:45:14.350
<v Speaker 3>garage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>living here in la,</v>

3595
02:45:14.351 --> 02:45:16.650
<v Speaker 3>we go to this whole parking garages</v>
<v Speaker 3>downtown here,</v>

3596
02:45:16.660 --> 02:45:17.500
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

3597
02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:18.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be a sandwich.</v>

3598
02:45:18.730 --> 02:45:20.350
<v Speaker 3>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man,</v>

3599
02:45:20.351 --> 02:45:22.780
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came to la right after the first</v>

3600
02:45:22.781 --> 02:45:24.180
<v Speaker 3>earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3601
02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:26.440
<v Speaker 3>first one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously the big one,</v>

3602
02:45:26.620 --> 02:45:28.390
<v Speaker 3>the last big one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3603
02:45:28.420 --> 02:45:31.120
<v Speaker 3>and then there was some small ones after</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3604
02:45:32.290 --> 02:45:36.310
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that one of the biggest ones was</v>

3605
02:45:36.311 --> 02:45:38.740
<v Speaker 3>san francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think san francisco was during the</v>

3606
02:45:38.741 --> 02:45:40.960
<v Speaker 3>world series.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a really big one.</v>

3607
02:45:41.020 --> 02:45:43.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How big was that one?</v>

3608
02:45:43.150 --> 02:45:46.360
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it going on during a game?</v>

3609
02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:49.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the middle of the game world started</v>

3610
02:45:49.631 --> 02:45:51.730
<v Speaker 3>to end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be cool footage.</v>

3611
02:45:51.731 --> 02:45:54.970
<v Speaker 3>San francisco gets a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a six point nine is the same</v>

3612
02:45:54.971 --> 02:45:56.560
<v Speaker 3>as the one on why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3613
02:45:58.030 --> 02:46:00.050
<v Speaker 3>What's the coincidence of that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

3614
02:46:00.340 --> 02:46:02.950
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's some powerful shit.</v>

3615
02:46:03.030 --> 02:46:05.380
<v Speaker 3>And</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the.</v>

3616
02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:08.400
<v Speaker 3>To me</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>

3617
02:46:10.670 --> 02:46:12.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a thing that we all know to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>

3618
02:46:12.800 --> 02:46:15.380
<v Speaker 1>but you don't think about it until it</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

3619
02:46:15.800 --> 02:46:19.730
<v Speaker 1>We all know that the earth's mantle</v>
<v Speaker 1>shifts and moves.</v>

3620
02:46:19.880 --> 02:46:21.440
<v Speaker 1>We know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it happens.</v>

3621
02:46:21.620 --> 02:46:24.380
<v Speaker 1>We know that earthquakes happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know the volcanoes happen,</v>

3622
02:46:24.381 --> 02:46:26.960
<v Speaker 1>but even so it's still</v>

3623
02:46:30.520 --> 02:46:35.520
<v Speaker 3>the hesitation allowing jose conseco to</v>
<v Speaker 3>score and he goes to get dave parker.</v>

3624
02:46:37.361 --> 02:46:39.440
<v Speaker 3>So when is the earthquake here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second phase.</v>

3625
02:46:39.450 --> 02:46:40.720
<v Speaker 3>So the oakland a's.</v>

3626
02:46:48.190 --> 02:46:49.540
<v Speaker 2>It's like a scene in a movie.</v>

3627
02:46:49.620 --> 02:46:52.950
<v Speaker 7>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Holy shit.</v>

3628
02:46:56.100 --> 02:46:56.933
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

3629
02:46:58.510 --> 02:47:00.100
<v Speaker 1>That's just one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3630
02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:03.050
<v Speaker 2>we think of it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3631
02:47:03.051 --> 02:47:04.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the earthquakes are real,</v>

3632
02:47:04.880 --> 02:47:08.090
<v Speaker 2>but until it actually happens at scary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of scary.</v>

3633
02:47:08.150 --> 02:47:10.010
<v Speaker 2>You felt a good one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3634
02:47:10.040 --> 02:47:14.390
<v Speaker 2>You felt a little bit of a tremor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like it used to be way more</v>

3635
02:47:14.391 --> 02:47:18.380
<v Speaker 2>when I first moved here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I almost feel one like once a month</v>

3636
02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:20.930
<v Speaker 2>for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't felt one in a long time.</v>

3637
02:47:21.500 --> 02:47:25.380
<v Speaker 2>It's on tape right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is red bands feeling?</v>

3638
02:47:25.390 --> 02:47:26.001
<v Speaker 2>The earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3639
02:47:26.001 --> 02:47:27.410
<v Speaker 2>This is when I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt</v>

3640
02:47:27.640 --> 02:47:31.180
<v Speaker 3>this is probably the biggest one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember really.</v>

3641
02:47:32.110 --> 02:47:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Death squad studio</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't frozen.</v>

3642
02:47:41.220 --> 02:47:43.330
<v Speaker 3>This happened to me before we to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There it goes.</v>

3643
02:47:46.120 --> 02:47:48.840
<v Speaker 3>I started thinking about our insurance</v>
<v Speaker 3>covers this</v>

3644
02:47:51.460 --> 02:47:52.293
<v Speaker 3>frozen.</v>

3645
02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Is it youtube is fault on my computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3646
02:47:56.591 --> 02:47:57.520
<v Speaker 2>is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3647
02:47:57.521 --> 02:47:58.700
<v Speaker 2>is it the machine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3648
02:47:58.830 --> 02:48:02.040
<v Speaker 2>Tri caster think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3649
02:48:02.130 --> 02:48:04.740
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that freaked me out because we had the</v>

3650
02:48:04.780 --> 02:48:07.810
<v Speaker 2>studio at the ice house and I kept on</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the ceiling.</v>

3651
02:48:07.811 --> 02:48:10.300
<v Speaker 2>Just cave in because that's like an old</v>
<v Speaker 2>building.</v>

3652
02:48:10.690 --> 02:48:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I freaked the fuck out,</v>

3653
02:48:13.271 --> 02:48:15.790
<v Speaker 2>but that was scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they did something to make it</v>

3654
02:48:15.791 --> 02:48:18.810
<v Speaker 2>earthquake compliant though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know if I'm.</v>

3655
02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:20.330
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm right about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

3656
02:48:20.500 --> 02:48:22.780
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how you walked through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>courtyard area?</v>

3657
02:48:23.470 --> 02:48:24.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3658
02:48:24.480 --> 02:48:28.180
<v Speaker 2>They put all that stuff apparently to</v>
<v Speaker 2>reinforce it from earthquakes.</v>

3659
02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that the walls or something it</v>

3660
02:48:31.091 --> 02:48:36.091
<v Speaker 2>might fix but not the ceiling fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall right through it links.</v>

3661
02:48:36.191 --> 02:48:39.280
<v Speaker 2>It's already have that building's phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

3662
02:48:39.340 --> 02:48:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 50 something I probably said</v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier than that.</v>

3663
02:48:43.661 --> 02:48:45.890
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think crazy old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3664
02:48:45.970 --> 02:48:48.100
<v Speaker 2>Like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's been an operation as a</v>

3665
02:48:48.101 --> 02:48:52.050
<v Speaker 2>nightclub since the sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it started out as an actual ice</v>

3666
02:48:52.060 --> 02:48:54.280
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like way earlier than that opened in</v>

3667
02:48:54.281 --> 02:48:56.710
<v Speaker 2>1960,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1969.</v>

3668
02:48:56.770 --> 02:48:59.890
<v Speaker 2>It opened the ice house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was it before in that building?</v>

3669
02:49:00.460 --> 02:49:03.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure in that building and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't actual ice house,</v>

3670
02:49:03.041 --> 02:49:04.980
<v Speaker 2>which is why they decided to call it the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ice house.</v>

3671
02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:07.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sean's doesn't work there.</v>

3672
02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:08.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3673
02:49:08.170 --> 02:49:09.810
<v Speaker 5>It sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twenty years.</v>

3674
02:49:09.990 --> 02:49:11.070
<v Speaker 5>He's an awesome guy.</v>

3675
02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Place is so sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3676
02:49:14.490 --> 02:49:15.323
<v Speaker 1>where do you go?</v>

3677
02:49:15.440 --> 02:49:16.260
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure.</v>

3678
02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:17.550
<v Speaker 5>I haven't talked to him about it on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>air.</v>

3679
02:49:18.310 --> 02:49:20.910
<v Speaker 5>Go tom.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You said besides therapist now.</v>

3680
02:49:21.130 --> 02:49:24.860
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he does it better than anybody at first.</v>

3681
02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:29.160
<v Speaker 5>Feels weird because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the air blows it in there.</v>

3682
02:49:29.190 --> 02:49:30.250
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's,</v>

3683
02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:35.640
<v Speaker 5>that's not fda approved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine if this was,</v>

3684
02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:41.480
<v Speaker 5>is that a rub maps still a thing when</v>
<v Speaker 5>backpage still funny.</v>

3685
02:49:42.551 --> 02:49:44.340
<v Speaker 5>I know this went backpage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3686
02:49:44.370 --> 02:49:47.820
<v Speaker 5>went down a rub.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maps kind of freaked out for like a week</v>

3687
02:49:47.910 --> 02:49:48.691
<v Speaker 5>and said like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3688
02:49:48.691 --> 02:49:49.480
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not,</v>

3689
02:49:49.480 --> 02:49:50.880
<v Speaker 5>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not open right now.</v>

3690
02:49:51.090 --> 02:49:52.140
<v Speaker 5>Nothing's working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3691
02:49:52.270 --> 02:49:54.420
<v Speaker 5>you won't be charged this month.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3692
02:49:54.630 --> 02:49:57.210
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then like a couple of weeks later</v>

3693
02:49:57.211 --> 02:50:00.270
<v Speaker 5>that it's back in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was always working to like,</v>

3694
02:50:00.271 --> 02:50:02.160
<v Speaker 5>it just had this weird notice before it.</v>

3695
02:50:02.850 --> 02:50:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how people feel,</v>

3696
02:50:05.310 --> 02:50:06.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are in that business,</v>

3697
02:50:08.670 --> 02:50:11.880
<v Speaker 1>those backpage companies and all those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those companies that are,</v>

3698
02:50:11.940 --> 02:50:12.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

3699
02:50:13.290 --> 02:50:14.123
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3700
02:50:14.380 --> 02:50:16.410
<v Speaker 1>some that's like the classifieds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3701
02:50:16.460 --> 02:50:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3702
02:50:17.010 --> 02:50:19.270
<v Speaker 1>so they have to pay to be in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>classifieds that don't work.</v>

3703
02:50:19.830 --> 02:50:21.660
<v Speaker 1>So they lose all that business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>

3704
02:50:21.750 --> 02:50:23.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like a nonverbal business anymore.</v>

3705
02:50:23.850 --> 02:50:26.700
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>roadmaps was good because it was like</v>

3706
02:50:26.701 --> 02:50:30.990
<v Speaker 5>yelp for a massage parlor and and so you</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you wanted to go.</v>

3707
02:50:31.350 --> 02:50:33.840
<v Speaker 5>I use it for the opposite reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we're like,</v>

3708
02:50:33.841 --> 02:50:36.360
<v Speaker 5>the other day I wanted a real massage</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I checked to make sure that that</v>

3709
02:50:36.361 --> 02:50:39.020
<v Speaker 5>wasn't a rub and tug place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3710
02:50:39.690 --> 02:50:41.940
<v Speaker 5>Because they're all rubbing to have</v>
<v Speaker 5>places here in los angeles.</v>

3711
02:50:41.941 --> 02:50:45.210
<v Speaker 5>Like it's hard to find one that's not</v>
<v Speaker 5>now and sometimes you just don't want</v>

3712
02:50:45.211 --> 02:50:46.440
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want a real massage.</v>

3713
02:50:47.010 --> 02:50:50.040
<v Speaker 5>I guess what I said doesn't make sense</v>
<v Speaker 5>though because it's illegal activity.</v>

3714
02:50:50.430 --> 02:50:53.610
<v Speaker 5>So as long as it's illegal activity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course they have to take it down.</v>

3715
02:50:53.730 --> 02:50:55.070
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think.</v>

3716
02:50:55.110 --> 02:50:56.530
<v Speaker 5>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do they say?</v>

3717
02:50:56.531 --> 02:50:59.250
<v Speaker 5>Freedom of speech and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3718
02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:00.780
<v Speaker 5>like you're allowed to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 5>cocaine,</v>

3719
02:51:00.781 --> 02:51:03.150
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to get your website</v>
<v Speaker 5>taken down.</v>

3720
02:51:03.151 --> 02:51:04.050
<v Speaker 5>And that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like</v>

3721
02:51:04.650 --> 02:51:07.200
<v Speaker 1>not even what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't,</v>

3722
02:51:07.270 --> 02:51:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you're a person who is</v>

3723
02:51:12.541 --> 02:51:15.240
<v Speaker 1>making this decision and like 2018 you</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

3724
02:51:15.241 --> 02:51:17.340
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to crack down on prostitution.</v>

3725
02:51:17.370 --> 02:51:20.190
<v Speaker 1>We got to figure out a way to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to figure out a way to put a stop</v>

3726
02:51:20.191 --> 02:51:22.950
<v Speaker 1>to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3727
02:51:23.430 --> 02:51:27.060
<v Speaker 1>what are you wasting your time doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that for a don't we have other really</v>

3728
02:51:27.120 --> 02:51:30.360
<v Speaker 1>big issues that we have a hard time</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding enough people to tackle.</v>

3729
02:51:30.430 --> 02:51:33.780
<v Speaker 5>The biggest problem is sex trafficking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the real reason.</v>

3730
02:51:33.900 --> 02:51:35.080
<v Speaker 5>Like there's too much traffic.</v>

3731
02:51:35.120 --> 02:51:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3732
02:51:36.380 --> 02:51:37.213
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one.</v>

3733
02:51:37.650 --> 02:51:40.470
<v Speaker 10>I'm</v>
<v Speaker 10>just.</v>

3734
02:51:41.470 --> 02:51:43.350
<v Speaker 1>When everything's unregulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3735
02:51:43.810 --> 02:51:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's unregulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always going to find someone who</v>

3736
02:51:47.141 --> 02:51:50.950
<v Speaker 1>fills that gap was a criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's illegal that people</v>

3737
02:51:50.951 --> 02:51:53.100
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's drugs,</v>

3738
02:51:53.260 --> 02:51:56.140
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to tell people what</v>

3739
02:51:56.141 --> 02:51:58.120
<v Speaker 1>they can and can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard.</v>

3740
02:51:58.940 --> 02:52:01.450
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be able to.</v>

3741
02:52:01.451 --> 02:52:03.340
<v Speaker 1>As long as no one's getting hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3742
02:52:03.341 --> 02:52:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Like what if someone decides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

3743
02:52:04.901 --> 02:52:06.370
<v Speaker 1>we at this furry thing</v>

3744
02:52:06.370 --> 02:52:10.030
<v Speaker 2>and you guys are just too weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do this anymore.</v>

3745
02:52:10.180 --> 02:52:14.350
<v Speaker 2>You can't just dress up like mascots and</v>
<v Speaker 2>have sex with each other and eat a dog.</v>

3746
02:52:14.351 --> 02:52:17.310
<v Speaker 2>Food bowls can't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's neat.</v>

3747
02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:20.500
<v Speaker 2>These people ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're having a party as furries.</v>

3748
02:52:20.680 --> 02:52:22.060
<v Speaker 2>What if someone came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes along and says,</v>

3749
02:52:22.061 --> 02:52:23.800
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too weird.</v>

3750
02:52:25.260 --> 02:52:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Have reacted fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3751
02:52:29.050 --> 02:52:32.800
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's weird where people</v>
<v Speaker 2>just can decide what other people can</v>

3752
02:52:32.801 --> 02:52:37.801
<v Speaker 2>and can't do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially when it comes to something as</v>

3753
02:52:38.191 --> 02:52:43.191
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous as sex</v>
<v Speaker 2>touching is that thing that makes no</v>

3754
02:52:44.231 --> 02:52:47.050
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like hand jobs should not be illegal.</v>

3755
02:52:47.140 --> 02:52:50.020
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're allowed to touch my arm but</v>

3756
02:52:50.021 --> 02:52:52.720
<v Speaker 2>you can't touch my dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be real weird.</v>

3757
02:52:53.020 --> 02:52:58.020
<v Speaker 2>When robots are fuckable like really</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird when they're really fuckable like</v>

3758
02:52:58.511 --> 02:52:59.344
<v Speaker 2>they're hot.</v>

3759
02:53:00.580 --> 02:53:02.200
<v Speaker 2>You know the hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels good.</v>

3760
02:53:03.620 --> 02:53:05.770
<v Speaker 2>What if someone raped that robot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it going to have rights?</v>

3761
02:53:05.950 --> 02:53:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ going to kill you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

3762
02:53:08.050 --> 02:53:11.650
<v Speaker 2>They don't need to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That chick's gonna wait until your sleep</v>

3763
02:53:11.651 --> 02:53:14.200
<v Speaker 2>and then she's going to fucking elbow</v>
<v Speaker 2>your eye sockets right through.</v>

3764
02:53:14.650 --> 02:53:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Like I got arrested for like fucking a</v>
<v Speaker 2>car recently or something like that.</v>

3765
02:53:17.501 --> 02:53:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't hear about that.</v>

3766
02:53:19.870 --> 02:53:24.870
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a matter of time before</v>
<v Speaker 2>they develop an ai in a physical body</v>

3767
02:53:25.511 --> 02:53:30.100
<v Speaker 2>that's so closely resembles a human body</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could turn the lights down,</v>

3768
02:53:30.310 --> 02:53:31.780
<v Speaker 2>light a candle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those new ones,</v>

3769
02:53:31.830 --> 02:53:34.030
<v Speaker 2>like the hottest girl in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've seen the new ones,</v>

3770
02:53:34.031 --> 02:53:35.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The new sexual sex robots,</v>

3771
02:53:35.801 --> 02:53:37.810
<v Speaker 2>the ones I think they're making,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make them in san diego.</v>

3772
02:53:37.811 --> 02:53:39.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the same guy that made the</v>
<v Speaker 2>real dog,</v>

3773
02:53:39.960 --> 02:53:42.590
<v Speaker 2>but that he has that new ai and the new</v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies.</v>

3774
02:53:42.790 --> 02:53:44.770
<v Speaker 2>It's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can order it now.</v>

3775
02:53:44.771 --> 02:53:49.771
<v Speaker 2>I think a preorder it now it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had a video of it and then the ai</v>

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3820
02:55:53.210 --> 02:55:55.220

<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

3821
02:55:55.580 --> 02:55:58.580
<v Speaker 3>I think we can wrap this up safely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I miss this.</v>

3822
02:55:59.060 --> 02:56:00.060
<v Speaker 3>These are strange days.</v>

3823
02:56:02.670 --> 02:56:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I think we learned a lot today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not know that you could make a</v>

3824
02:56:06.901 --> 02:56:11.070
<v Speaker 1>fucking phone call with an artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence thing that could say um,</v>

3825
02:56:11.460 --> 02:56:13.560
<v Speaker 1>and would make appointments for you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

3826
02:56:13.561 --> 02:56:15.510
<v Speaker 1>And we all learned that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That scared the shit out of me.</v>

3827
02:56:16.350 --> 02:56:21.350
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know about these choo choo</v>
<v Speaker 1>train fake vagina attractions that these</v>

3828
02:56:22.501 --> 02:56:26.850
<v Speaker 1>kids are hacking is wacky kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned that I'm not.</v>

3829
02:56:27.610 --> 02:56:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I am very confused when it comes to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

3830
02:56:31.590 --> 02:56:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This stuff is.</v>

3831
02:56:33.090 --> 02:56:38.090
<v Speaker 1>I think this is all happening in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us and I think it's insanely crazy,</v>

3832
02:56:38.810 --> 02:56:42.600
<v Speaker 1>insanely transformative and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and we don't have a fucking</v>

3833
02:56:42.601 --> 02:56:44.710
<v Speaker 1>clue as to where it's going and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing we can do about it.</v>

3834
02:56:44.711 --> 02:56:45.544
<v Speaker 1>It's we're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3835
02:56:45.960 --> 02:56:50.130
<v Speaker 1>it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's nuts.</v>

3836
02:56:51.770 --> 02:56:54.810
<v Speaker 1>I think we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're 20 years from the fucking matrix</v>

3837
02:56:54.811 --> 02:56:57.510
<v Speaker 1>and we're seeing it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing it happen right now in</v>

3838
02:56:57.511 --> 02:56:59.400
<v Speaker 1>front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing a little baby steps like,</v>

3839
02:56:59.401 --> 02:56:59.911
<v Speaker 1>nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nah,</v>

3840
02:56:59.911 --> 02:57:01.410
<v Speaker 1>we're so far off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3841
02:57:01.411 --> 02:57:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I went to that whole thing the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

3842
02:57:03.570 --> 02:57:05.830
<v Speaker 1>It was nothing went to the conference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

3843
02:57:05.860 --> 02:57:06.750
<v Speaker 1>not that impressed me.</v>

3844
02:57:06.810 --> 02:57:09.580
<v Speaker 3>Which would you rather find out that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're about to be in it or that we've</v>

3845
02:57:09.600 --> 02:57:12.420
<v Speaker 3>been in it the whole time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which would make you more comfortable?</v>

3846
02:57:12.450 --> 02:57:15.030
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn,</v>

3847
02:57:15.031 --> 02:57:16.710
<v Speaker 3>that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think?</v>

3848
02:57:17.340 --> 02:57:19.250
<v Speaker 3>I think we're already in it so</v>

3849
02:57:22.430 --> 02:57:23.660
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gun to the head,</v>

3850
02:57:24.820 --> 02:57:26.110
<v Speaker 1>which you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would she say?</v>

3851
02:57:26.150 --> 02:57:31.150
<v Speaker 1>I think the reality itself is obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of weird thing because you're</v>

3852
02:57:31.431 --> 02:57:34.220
<v Speaker 1>looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you looking at it through your eyes,</v>

3853
02:57:34.310 --> 02:57:38.330
<v Speaker 1>your eyes are determining the positions</v>
<v Speaker 1>that things are in and what they look</v>

3854
02:57:38.331 --> 02:57:41.960
<v Speaker 1>like and where things are and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things that are going on</v>

3855
02:57:41.961 --> 02:57:45.320
<v Speaker 1>around you all the time that you have no</v>
<v Speaker 1>control of and they're everywhere all</v>

3856
02:57:45.321 --> 02:57:47.660
<v Speaker 1>over the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People living lives and you interface</v>

3857
02:57:47.661 --> 02:57:50.510
<v Speaker 1>with those lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally you just accustomed to the</v>

3858
02:57:50.511 --> 02:57:53.090
<v Speaker 1>manner in which you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it seems normal,</v>

3859
02:57:53.270 --> 02:57:56.750
<v Speaker 1>but every night you close your eyes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go unconscious and who knows what</v>

3860
02:57:56.751 --> 02:58:00.110
<v Speaker 1>the fuck happens to your brain and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wake up in the morning and you have</v>

3861
02:58:00.111 --> 02:58:03.700
<v Speaker 1>to pee and you're struggling to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what happened yesterday and</v>

3862
02:58:03.701 --> 02:58:06.690
<v Speaker 1>then while this is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ex girlfriend's fucking your best</v>

3863
02:58:06.691 --> 02:58:10.560
<v Speaker 1>friend from high school and they got</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and can't believe jamie left.</v>

3864
02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:13.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean he said he was going to stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever and then next thing you know</v>

3865
02:58:13.890 --> 02:58:17.880
<v Speaker 1>like this is all these lives intersect</v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other all over the world.</v>

3866
02:58:17.910 --> 02:58:21.650
<v Speaker 1>It is kind of a hologram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a crazy react.</v>

3867
02:58:22.050 --> 02:58:26.940
<v Speaker 1>If the real life wasn't real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be super interesting.</v>

3868
02:58:27.540 --> 02:58:29.640
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the way life works.</v>

3869
02:58:29.641 --> 02:58:34.641
<v Speaker 1>Look at the way they breathe in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathe out carbon dioxide and the trees</v>

3870
02:58:34.741 --> 02:58:37.410
<v Speaker 1>breathe into carbon dioxide and breathe</v>
<v Speaker 1>out air,</v>

3871
02:58:37.500 --> 02:58:41.010
<v Speaker 1>but they keep chopping down the trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They keep chopping down the trees.</v>

3872
02:58:41.011 --> 02:58:42.030
<v Speaker 1>They don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

3873
02:58:42.031 --> 02:58:44.970
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want paper to wipe my ass with a tree.</v>

3874
02:58:45.280 --> 02:58:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Just wipe their ass with trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally they grind millions of trees</v>

3875
02:58:49.441 --> 02:58:54.060
<v Speaker 1>down every year and turned into pulp so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can make paper to wipe their ass.</v>

3876
02:58:54.270 --> 02:58:56.400
<v Speaker 1>They literally wiped her ass with</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

3877
02:58:57.320 --> 02:58:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they just use soap and water?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3878
02:59:00.600 --> 02:59:01.800
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a treat.</v>

3879
02:59:02.760 --> 02:59:06.540

<v Speaker 1>Wipe my ass with tissue paper,</v>

3880

<v Speaker 1>tissue paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking trees.</v>

02:59:12.360 --> 02:59:13.770
<v Speaker 1>It's tissue paper really made out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>trees.</v>

3882

<v Speaker 1>of like dolphin tears.</v>

3884

<v Speaker 1>Something worse.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Hemp.</v>

3892
02:59:43.620 --> 02:59:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Someone's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm putting it together.</v>

3893
02:59:47.370 --> 02:59:50.240

<v Speaker 1>I was reading all the people that</v>

3895
02:59:52.360 --> 02:59:57.360
<v Speaker 1>invested hundreds of millions of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 1>into that scam.</v>

3896
02:59:57.860 --> 03:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>A blood test company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That blood test company story is crazy.</v>

3897
03:00:03.330 --> 03:00:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Toronto's there was this woman and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were calling her like the next steve</v>

3898
03:00:08.701 --> 03:00:12.270
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the female steve jobs even dressed</v>

3899
03:00:12.271 --> 03:00:14.400
<v Speaker 1>like I'm short black turtlenecks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3900
03:00:14.401 --> 03:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had become this self made person I</v>

3901
03:00:18.571 --> 03:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>think from college started this company</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then by the time she was like 40,</v>

3902
03:00:23.401 --> 03:00:28.401
<v Speaker 1>whatever she was when they busted her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was worth $34,000,000,000 because</v>

3903
03:00:29.641 --> 03:00:33.900
<v Speaker 1>there's blood testing thing that she had</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed and then as time went on they</v>

3904
03:00:33.901 --> 03:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>realized that it didn't really work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then all these people had invested like</v>

3905
03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>betsy devos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>

3906
03:00:40.230 --> 03:00:45.230
<v Speaker 1>And warren buffet had warren buffet</v>
<v Speaker 1>invested over $100,000,000 or 25.</v>

3907
03:00:45.660 --> 03:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this company that was bullshit.</v>

3908
03:00:50.041 --> 03:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put these people's health at risk</v>

3909
03:00:52.620 --> 03:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>because they gave them these tests and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the test didn't work and they're showing</v>

3910
03:00:55.771 --> 03:00:59.070
<v Speaker 1>that they kind of knew the test didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>work with this is how this woman dressed</v>

3911
03:00:59.080 --> 03:01:02.050
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

3912
03:01:02.350 --> 03:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3913
03:01:03.481 --> 03:01:06.940
<v Speaker 1>It's so really interesting story because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see the amount of money that</v>

3914
03:01:06.941 --> 03:01:09.760
<v Speaker 1>people invested into it and then they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just shit out of luck.</v>

3915
03:01:10.300 --> 03:01:13.810
<v Speaker 1>She went from being worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she was worth something crazy.</v>

3916
03:01:13.990 --> 03:01:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Like the richest woman ever are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>richest self made woman ever.</v>

3917
03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Something along those lines is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she was worth like $34 million</v>

3918
03:01:21.131 --> 03:01:24.100
<v Speaker 1>dollars at one point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has a twitter.</v>

3919
03:01:25.570 --> 03:01:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she's recently been charged</v>

3920
03:01:27.611 --> 03:01:29.590
<v Speaker 1>with massive fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3921
03:01:29.830 --> 03:01:32.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know shit about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

3922
03:01:32.980 --> 03:01:36.820
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if the blood tests did</v>
<v Speaker 1>or didn't work or if she's got a store</v>

3923
03:01:36.821 --> 03:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>that needs to be told.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know,</v>

3924
03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3925
03:01:39.870 --> 03:01:42.670
<v Speaker 1>Just read what you read and what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>read is that they,</v>

3926
03:01:42.760 --> 03:01:47.350
<v Speaker 1>they've fibbed about results and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>did some shit they shouldn't have done</v>

3927
03:01:47.351 --> 03:01:49.930
<v Speaker 1>and all these people got tests and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought they were,</v>

3928
03:01:50.620 --> 03:01:51.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get a blood test,</v>

3929
03:01:51.761 --> 03:01:54.400
<v Speaker 1>you think you're getting the accurate</v>
<v Speaker 1>results from a reputable company.</v>

3930
03:01:54.401 --> 03:01:56.440
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a micro click,</v>

3931
03:01:56.441 --> 03:02:00.160
<v Speaker 1>like they would take like a micro prick</v>
<v Speaker 1>of blood and they would take that blood</v>

3932
03:02:00.161 --> 03:02:03.430
<v Speaker 1>and they would measure it and that's how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would find whether you had diseases</v>

3933
03:02:03.431 --> 03:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>

3934
03:02:03.840 --> 03:02:04.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I use that one.</v>

<v Speaker 4>half billion.</v>

3936
03:02:08.170 --> 03:02:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why don't I save 34?</v>

3937
03:02:09.810 --> 03:02:12.910
<v Speaker 1>So that's not even real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has that much like three guys,</v>

3938
03:02:13.140 --> 03:02:14.650
<v Speaker 1>a couple other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3939
03:02:14.950 --> 03:02:17.860
<v Speaker 1>So she's worth 4 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's still nothing to sneeze at.</v>

3940
03:02:17.900 --> 03:02:21.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like a two bedroom apartment</v>
<v Speaker 1>remembered for I see a four.</v>

3941
03:02:21.490 --> 03:02:23.380

3944
03:02:27.940 --> 03:02:29.170

<v Speaker 1>the store,</v>
