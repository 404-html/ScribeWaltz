00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.530
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.760
<v Speaker 1>What I was going to say is that the,</v>

3
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.390
<v Speaker 1>when we were talking about the uh,</v>

5
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.500
<v Speaker 1>needing some sort of a,</v>

6
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>a lesson in how to think and how to operate the mind.</v>

7
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>If the human mind,</v>

8
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>if the human body was the just,</v>

9
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:17.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>just the human experience.</v>

11
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:19.014
<v Speaker 1>If that was an,</v>

12
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>an instrument that you had to learn to use,</v>

13
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.590
<v Speaker 1>think about navigating the human life with the human body and language and think</v>

14
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>about if you came from somewhere else and the human body wasn't in the human</v>

15
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

16
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>wasn't just a person living a life,</v>

17
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>but rather was a ride that you had figured out how to,</v>

18
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>how to master,</v>

19
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.670
<v Speaker 1>how to accomplish and that the human animal with its creative abilities with</v>

20
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>disabilities or reach out to people with,</v>

21
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.160
<v Speaker 1>it's a ability to build buildings and use electricity,</v>

22
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.013
<v Speaker 1>all these different things.</v>

23
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.551
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

24
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:54.384
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

25
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.433
<v Speaker 1>that's a vehicle.</v>

26
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>That's what that is.</v>

27
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Learn it,</v>

28
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>learn how to use that vehicle.</v>

29
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.010
<v Speaker 1>You would have intensive study for a low for years</v>

30
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 1>of just trying to figure out how to go about the correct way of doing this.</v>

31
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.473
<v Speaker 1>They would be like,</v>

32
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:10.141
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

34
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to figure out what is the best way to think,</v>

35
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>what is the best way,</v>

36
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 1>what most beneficial way to you to approach every project as a,</v>

37
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>as a person moving around in this human world with this human machine,</v>

38
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>it would be like a super complicated thing,</v>

39
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.560
<v Speaker 1>but instead it's just two people.</v>

40
00:01:25.561 --> 00:01:26.394
<v Speaker 1>Fucking,</v>

41
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 1>some guy shoots a load in the girl,</v>

42
00:01:29.371 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

43
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>She swells up,</v>

44
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>plank.</v>

45
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 1>A person comes out,</v>

46
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.510
<v Speaker 1>no one knows shit.</v>

47
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Sound effects by the way.</v>

48
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

49
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>So the three of them are standing there.</v>

50
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 1>No one knows what the fuck is going on and they keep doing the same thing.</v>

51
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.510
<v Speaker 1>They keep interacting with each other.</v>

52
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.363
<v Speaker 1>Same thing,</v>

53
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.520
<v Speaker 1>the way the human,</v>

54
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.200
<v Speaker 1>the way the human being and the human body interacts with the world is so</v>

55
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:54.201
<v Speaker 1>bizarre and complicated and to get it right and correct takes so much fucking</v>

56
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:55.974
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

57
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

58
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>We just let these things just go loose out into the world,</v>

59
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:03.413
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

61
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.840
<v Speaker 1>which is why people are desperate and lonely and four stores were continents and</v>

62
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.490
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>

63
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.560
<v Speaker 1>There's a real machine going on with,</v>

64
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:17.561
<v Speaker 1>with society today and that machine is the building of society,</v>

65
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>the increasing of bandwidth,</v>

66
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>the interconnectivity that's provided by technology.</v>

68
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.040
<v Speaker 1>It's all of that and it's,</v>

69
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.050
<v Speaker 1>it's all of that with this exponentially increasing momentum behind it.</v>

70
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>And we're all caught up in that and we're caught up in that and we have</v>

71
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>mortgages and we have bills and we have all these,</v>

72
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.431
<v Speaker 1>but we're,</v>

73
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:37.651
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

74
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>we're doing is we're feeding this system,</v>

75
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>we're feeding the system of televisions and computers and cell phones and new</v>

76
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:46.980
<v Speaker 1>clothes and distracting.</v>

77
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

78
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.870
<v Speaker 1>it's so distracting.</v>

79
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like you,</v>

80
00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:49.561
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

81
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:52.420
<v Speaker 1>you start unknowledgeable and the Greek,</v>

82
00:02:52.421 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>so I said you go from knowledge but you don't jump all the way to wisdom.</v>

83
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 1>There's an in between place,</v>

84
00:02:56.491 --> 00:02:57.271
<v Speaker 1>which is correct.</v>

85
00:02:57.271 --> 00:02:58.104
<v Speaker 1>Opinion,</v>

86
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>correct opinion from when you study,</v>

87
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>as you're reaching for wisdom,</v>

88
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>you start to develop as the world crystallizes around you with the right</v>

89
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:06.650
<v Speaker 1>teaching and,</v>

90
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.503
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>

91
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>You start to learn what the what,</v>

92
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 1>what sort of the correct way to look at and reach and follow and the correct</v>

93
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:14.681
<v Speaker 1>opinion is,</v>

94
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:19.681
<v Speaker 1>and then you finally get to a point where you understand and can explain why</v>

95
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>that is the correct opinion.</v>

96
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 1>That takes a long fucking time.</v>

97
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>That's life mastery in a way,</v>

98
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's like what you're saying is it's,</v>

99
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.371
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

100
00:03:26.371 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

101
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a system and we tried it with public education,</v>

102
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:36.271
<v Speaker 1>but we don't have a way or a system to really teach people how to live the</v>

103
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>artist.</v>

104
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:38.231
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

105
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:40.000
<v Speaker 1>no one knows what the fuck they're doing and we,</v>

106
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 1>the people that we were raised by,</v>

107
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know what the fuck they're doing either.</v>

108
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

109
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>my parents are very nice people.</v>

110
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>My mother is a,</v>

111
00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 1>with my Stepdad,</v>

112
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 1>they'd been together forever.</v>

113
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're very nice couple,</v>

114
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>they're very nice people,</v>

115
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.900
<v Speaker 1>but they were raised by people who didn't know shit and their parents were</v>

116
00:03:58.241 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>raised by people who didn't know shit.</v>

117
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>And this era that we're living in right now.</v>

118
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like human beings are just starting to wake up and realize that we were all</v>

119
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>living in this weird sort of momentous world.</v>

120
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:13.610
<v Speaker 1>His world that moves on momentum and memento.</v>

121
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.620
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense at all and we're all just waking up realizing that it</v>

122
00:04:17.621 --> 00:04:20.020
<v Speaker 1>was set up by people didn't know what the fuck they were doing.</v>

123
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:20.531
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

124
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 1>they knew how to build buildings.</v>

125
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>They knew how to use electricity,</v>

126
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>but no one knew how to teach society,</v>

127
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:28.720
<v Speaker 1>how to chill the fuck out,</v>

128
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 1>relax and enjoy each other.</v>

129
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>Not One fucking person besides like Martin Luther King and a few people with</v>

130
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>some dreamy speeches.</v>

131
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.790
<v Speaker 1>Not One person emphasizes that in the role of government.</v>

132
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Not One person is pushing that like can't we figure out a way that human beings</v>

133
00:04:45.431 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 1>are just nicer to each other?</v>

134
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Can't we figure out a way where there's maybe a little bit less profit but also</v>

135
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 1>less pollution and less fucking with people and less light,</v>

136
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.180
<v Speaker 1>less control over the human populous?</v>

137
00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that possible?</v>

138
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.301
<v Speaker 1>I would say though,</v>

139
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 1>you're also dealing with the residue of,</v>

140
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>of a most of human history.</v>

141
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of it has been not enough to eat.</v>

142
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

143
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

144
00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:09.841
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

145
00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:10.561
<v Speaker 1>it's no doubt.</v>

146
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:13.140
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of things that led us to this point.</v>

147
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.480
<v Speaker 1>This is also the first point.</v>

148
00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:20.481
<v Speaker 1>We have a responsibility as the human beings that have the first access to this</v>

149
00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:24.630
<v Speaker 1>sort of information to not be looked at like a bunch of silly fucks where the</v>

150
00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:25.500
<v Speaker 1>people of the future,</v>

151
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.410
<v Speaker 1>because that's a real problem because if I look back,</v>

152
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean living this life right now,</v>

153
00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:33.840
<v Speaker 1>just looking at all that silly nonsense that human beings are involved with.</v>

154
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.831
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody,</v>

155
00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:38.760
<v Speaker 1>I looked on Twitter and everybody has these fucking equal signs on their,</v>

156

159
00:05:42.811 --> 00:05:43.640
<v Speaker 1>the quality.</v>

160
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.401
<v Speaker 1>It's a quality,</v>

161
00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:45.360
<v Speaker 1>it's marriage equality.</v>

162
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.680
<v Speaker 1>You should be,</v>

163
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.633
<v Speaker 1>you should be.</v>

164
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.880
<v Speaker 1>That's like saying you're having that on your Twitter Avatar.</v>

165
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.730
<v Speaker 1>You might as well just say water's wet is hot,</v>

166
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.420
