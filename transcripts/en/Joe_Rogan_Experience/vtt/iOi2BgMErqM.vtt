00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.310
<v Speaker 1>It was the most brutal injury I've ever,</v>

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.420
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen one of those before?</v>

4
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen a schoolgirl crushed?</v>

5
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.251
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

6
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:09.710
<v Speaker 1>I actually had my skull fractured,</v>

7
00:00:09.711 --> 00:00:10.544
<v Speaker 1>but not like that.</v>

8
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>That was the one of the worst things I've ever seen.</v>

9
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.273
<v Speaker 1>How did your sculpture,</v>

10
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>I got kicked in the back of the head and the guy had a steel plate and is a Shin</v>

11
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.373
<v Speaker 1>Guard in China.</v>

12
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.333
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

13
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Any Shin Guard.</v>

14
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.720
<v Speaker 1>So we had a shin guard on with a steel plate in it.</v>

15
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:25.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

17
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really think anything of it at the time,</v>

18
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.330
<v Speaker 1>this was what,</v>

20
00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:30.360
<v Speaker 1>like 10 years ago,</v>

21
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.550
<v Speaker 1>we would just fight all everywhere,</v>

23
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>anywhere or whatever,</v>

24
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:33.901
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

26
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>and not really think twice about it.</v>

27
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:37.190
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

28
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.693
<v Speaker 1>so I fought,</v>

30
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>he kicked me in the back of the head.</v>

31
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:40.531
<v Speaker 1>I got dropped,</v>

32
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:41.060
<v Speaker 1>got up,</v>

33
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I ended up knocking him out,</v>

34
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>fought again the very next day.</v>

35
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Wyatt,</v>

37
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.291
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

38
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Not Knock this guy out to,</v>

39
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.781
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

40
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>when we got back to the states,</v>

42
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>like I was having headaches all the time and I just thought I had a bad</v>

43
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:54.451
<v Speaker 1>concussion,</v>

44
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>but like to like,</v>

46
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:59.570
<v Speaker 1>almost like a month later I kept seeing these like flashes of light every,</v>

47
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>anytime someone would ever touch me,</v>

48
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 1>I'd be working with like little kids or girls and smaller people in just them</v>

50
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>touching me.</v>

51
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.600
<v Speaker 1>I'd get this like jolt and it,</v>

52
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:09.620
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of freaking me out and I,</v>

54
00:01:09.621 --> 00:01:09.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.150
<v Speaker 1>I was getting ready for another fight and,</v>

56
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:12.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>I had to get my Mri or a cat scan.</v>

58
00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I remember what it was.</v>

59
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:17.371
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

60
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:17.521
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

61
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>you got an inch and a half crack in the back of your skull.</v>

62
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.021
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

63
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why you're not a vegetable right now.</v>

64
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>You should be there.</v>

65
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.321
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

66
00:01:25.321 --> 00:01:27.020
<v Speaker 1>if you even hit that again,</v>

67
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 1>it would probably kill you.</v>

68
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Doctors always say that though.</v>

69
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

70
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:30.670
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

71
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>What was the last time you were fucking knocked out?</v>

72
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:33.511
<v Speaker 1>One more time.</v>

73
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:34.344
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead,</v>

74
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.920
<v Speaker 1>it was one inch closer to my spine.</v>

76
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>I'd be dead.</v>

77
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.311
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

78
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:38.641
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

79
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

80
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty a rough thing to happen.</v>

81
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 1>And I couldn't do anything other than hit the bag by myself for,</v>

82
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember how long it was still like it let it heal,</v>

83
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

84
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.520
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

85
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.360
<v Speaker 1>it was a total,</v>

86
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.790
<v Speaker 1>just essentially at a close its own,</v>

87
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:52.591
<v Speaker 1>there's just like,</v>

89
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>don't get hit,</v>

90
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 1>you don't get hit.</v>

91
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 1>And I was getting ready for a fight and I actually still tried to fight anyway.</v>

92
00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.971
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

93
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 1>the doctor who,</v>

95
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>the doctor who diagnosed it was the doctor for the fights.</v>

96
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.161
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

97
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:05.941
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>

98
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:06.121
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

99
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:06.901
<v Speaker 1>do he can't fight,</v>

100
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:07.734
<v Speaker 1>get out of here.</v>

101
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>How long after that was the fight?</v>

102
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>After the diagnosis?</v>

103
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

104
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.703
<v Speaker 1>like a week.</v>

105
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 1>That's a cat fight with fucking edge.</v>

106
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>That's just kind of the mentality I had coming up,</v>

107
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.081
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

108
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:23.310
<v Speaker 1>And how old were you at the time?</v>

109
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>25.</v>

110
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>So he just felt invulnerable?</v>

111
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.841
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

112
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:28.471
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

113
00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:28.771
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

114
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:29.100
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

115
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.290
<v Speaker 1>my mentality from the beginning has always been,</v>

116
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fight as long as I'm breathing.</v>

117
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

118
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten into fights with some of the worst injuries ever.</v>

119
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:37.201
<v Speaker 1>Broken hands,</v>

120
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 1>broken,</v>

121
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.730
<v Speaker 1>broken skulls,</v>

122
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:39.541
<v Speaker 1>broken faces.</v>

123
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's just the way I came up.</v>

124
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.851
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

125
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>like you're going to fight no matter what,</v>

126
00:02:43.141 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fight anyone,</v>

127
00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:44.971
<v Speaker 1>anywhere,</v>

128
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:45.511
<v Speaker 1>anytime,</v>

129
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:46.530
<v Speaker 1>any weight class.</v>

130
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's how I was able to get as much experience as I did.</v>

131
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

132
00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:50.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

133
00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:55.471
<v Speaker 1>The scientific research and showed at the red cell generation can be accelerated</v>

134
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.270
<v Speaker 1>if it is.</v>

135
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.270
<v Speaker 1>So in those circumstances then science has to uh,</v>

136
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>update the circumstances where their sales can be regenerated is like a,</v>

137
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 1>in 24 hours,</v>

138
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>the body is not able to adapt to the circumstances where there is a lack of</v>

139
00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:12.641
<v Speaker 1>oxygen.</v>

140
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>It is half the oxygen and last,</v>

141
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>and we go and see altitude on Kilimanjaro,</v>

142
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 1>like 20,000 feet at the top.</v>

143
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 1>So had to save 15,000 feet.</v>

144
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>The acclimatization,</v>

145
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.230
<v Speaker 1>the adaptation is not as fast in human bodies that we found his breathing</v>

146
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:37.171
<v Speaker 1>techniques and using the mind and that enabled us to accelerate that,</v>

147
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:39.390
<v Speaker 1>what they thought,</v>

148
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>what signs is thinking that uh,</v>

149
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>that it is arranged.</v>

150
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Autonomically so outside of our will and we cannot interfere,</v>

151
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>we cannot intervene now.</v>

152
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

153
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>so we,</v>

154
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

155
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.660
<v Speaker 1>we'll showed it with uh,</v>

156
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>like 30 people by the way past the January.</v>

157
00:03:57.881 --> 00:04:02.881
<v Speaker 1>I did it with a person 76 years old without a prior mountaineering experience.</v>

158
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>And he did it in 44 hours,</v>

159
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

160
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.561
<v Speaker 1>76.</v>

161
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

162
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a robust 76 year old,</v>

163
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.203
<v Speaker 1>but he was a good guy.</v>

164
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

165
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.220
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

166
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 1>so over a couple of days his old life is dead,</v>

167
00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 1>really transferred.</v>

168
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

169
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

170
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you this.</v>

171
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.990
<v Speaker 1>So the standard model of what someone can do as far as how much red,</v>

172
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 1>so red blood cells they can generate is observed and they thought that it was at</v>

173
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>15,000 feet,</v>

174
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 1>it became too difficult.</v>

175
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.670
<v Speaker 1>But you've shown that with your exercises and when your deep breathing</v>

176
00:04:39.671 --> 00:04:44.671
<v Speaker 1>techniques that you can actually accelerate red blood cell count consciously or</v>

177
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:49.360
<v Speaker 1>at least not consciously through conscious action,</v>

178
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.480
<v Speaker 1>conscious action using the breath.</v>

179
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>And what techniques are you using?</v>

180
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 1>The same what we did last time,</v>

181
00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 1>but then adapted to while you are walking and when,</v>

182
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:00.251
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

183
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:00.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

184
00:05:00.611 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 1>first sign of ams,</v>

185
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:04.600
<v Speaker 1>lack of oxygen in the hat means headache.</v>

186
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.200
<v Speaker 1>A EMS is acute mountain sickness and the first sinus headache and that means a</v>

187
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:13.120
<v Speaker 1>lack of oxygen inside the brain.</v>

188
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:18.121
<v Speaker 1>Normally we are not able to get the oxygen then at that moment inside the brain</v>

189
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>to equal the balance that this balance,</v>

190
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>the lack of oxygen.</v>

191
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.820
<v Speaker 1>And I've learned to just to do that.</v>

192
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Speaker 1>So we tackled the problem and keep on,</v>

193
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.181
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

194
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:33.181
<v Speaker 1>able to perform in the extreme conditions even so through this technique of</v>

195
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>taking these enormous deep breaths,</v>

196
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>letting some of it out and then trying to refill and then letting some of it</v>

197
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:39.910
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

198
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 1>trying to refill,</v>

199
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Speaker 1>letting some of it out.</v>

200
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.410
<v Speaker 1>And then you're,</v>

201
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.450
<v Speaker 1>you're forcing your body to forcing your lungs to constantly carry air.</v>

202
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.483
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

203
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

204
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:53.620
<v Speaker 1>that it is,</v>

205
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>we use the lungs is the passage way,</v>

206
00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>but it gets into the lymphatic system.</v>

207
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 1>It gets into the tissue.</v>

208
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:02.740
<v Speaker 1>You know what we just found with the university in a,</v>

209
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 1>in Germany,</v>

210
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.040
<v Speaker 1>they found out that the devices that show that we have hundred percent,</v>

211
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

212
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>blood saturation,</v>

213
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 1>oxygen and the blood is not hundred percent.</v>

214
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:16.663
<v Speaker 1>We go more.</v>

215
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

216
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.790
<v Speaker 1>They found it out for the first thought was 100% blood saturation.</v>

217
00:06:21.791 --> 00:06:23.500
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a higher level above that.</v>

218
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.453
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

219
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I always sad,</v>

220
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>but now it's uh,</v>

221
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.810
<v Speaker 1>it's like proofing</v>

222
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.283
<v Speaker 2>and that I,</v>

223
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

224
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:32.840
<v Speaker 2>for people listening that might be in one of those valleys,</v>

225
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:33.674
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

226
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 2>don't try to just get through it,</v>

227
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.420
<v Speaker 2>really ask,</v>

228
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.531
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

229
00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

230
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 2>what can I learn from this?</v>

231
00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.090
<v Speaker 2>That was my biggest thing is I stopped asking why is this happening to me?</v>

232
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 2>And started asking,</v>

233
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:48.403
<v Speaker 2>what can I learn?</v>

234
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

235
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.460
<v Speaker 1>So instead of painting yourself as a victim,</v>

236
00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.280
<v Speaker 1>you paint yourself with someone who is present in the moment and just,</v>

237
00:06:54.281 --> 00:06:54.521
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

238
00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:55.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do this anymore.</v>

239
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

240
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Let's figure out what's going on.</v>

241
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.551
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

242
00:06:57.551 --> 00:06:58.060
<v Speaker 2>And we don't,</v>

243
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.670
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times we don't have the tools and that's where things like life</v>

244
00:07:00.671 --> 00:07:03.210
<v Speaker 2>coaching and personal development come in handy is quits.</v>

245
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.270
<v Speaker 2>We can go and get those tools instead of using our old coping mechanisms by like</v>

246
00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:08.950
<v Speaker 2>being strong or overing,</v>

247
00:07:08.951 --> 00:07:09.581
<v Speaker 2>overworking,</v>

248
00:07:09.581 --> 00:07:10.900
<v Speaker 2>overdrinking over do you know,</v>

249
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.390
<v Speaker 2>jumping into a relationship like whatever it may be.</v>

250
00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:14.140
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

251
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.920
<v Speaker 2>we don't really learn how to deal with disappointment,</v>

252
00:07:17.921 --> 00:07:18.581
<v Speaker 2>failure,</v>

253
00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:19.540
<v Speaker 2>anger or shame,</v>

254
00:07:19.541 --> 00:07:20.380
<v Speaker 2>any of those things.</v>

255
00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:25.381
<v Speaker 2>And so we're kind of left to these quick fix devices that I think that's a big</v>

256
00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:29.530
<v Speaker 2>reason addiction is such a problem is because we don't really learn how to</v>

257
00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:32.320
<v Speaker 2>manage emotion and how to manage just appointment.</v>

258
00:07:32.321 --> 00:07:35.860
<v Speaker 2>And so we go for that thing that makes us feel better in the moment.</v>

259
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.380
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is we have to keep upping the ante.</v>

260
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.603
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

261
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.760
<v Speaker 2>at first that one glass of wine does the trick,</v>

262
00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:43.811
<v Speaker 2>but then you need to,</v>

263
00:07:43.811 --> 00:07:44.441
<v Speaker 2>then you need three,</v>

264
00:07:44.441 --> 00:07:45.250
<v Speaker 2>then need vodka,</v>

265
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.360
<v Speaker 2>whatever it may be.</v>

266
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:47.291
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

267
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:48.124
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

268
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.960
<v Speaker 2>why I'm so passionate about what I do is,</v>

269
00:07:49.961 --> 00:07:50.794
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

270
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.030
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>

271
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.250
<v Speaker 2>I never thought I could be happy.</v>

272
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.473
<v Speaker 2>Like I really didn't.</v>

273
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.850
<v Speaker 2>I thought that this,</v>

274
00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

275
00:07:58.211 --> 00:07:58.810
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

276
00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:03.100
<v Speaker 2>I was going to be depressed and I just was gonna constantly be looking for</v>

277
00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:04.660
<v Speaker 2>something to fix me.</v>

278
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.400
<v Speaker 2>I never really,</v>

279
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.540
<v Speaker 2>truly thought this life that I'm living now what as possible.</v>

280
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

281
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:11.681
<v Speaker 2>externally,</v>

282
00:08:11.681 --> 00:08:12.311
<v Speaker 2>things look fine,</v>

283
00:08:12.311 --> 00:08:16.480
<v Speaker 2>but internally I'm talking about a totally different kind of experience and it's</v>

284
00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:19.990
<v Speaker 2>only because of those like really awful moments.</v>

285
00:08:19.991 --> 00:08:24.991
<v Speaker 2>I call them expectation hangovers that I was kind of desperate enough to let go</v>

286
00:08:25.931 --> 00:08:30.310
<v Speaker 2>of my normal coping mechanisms and my trying to control everything.</v>

287
00:08:30.311 --> 00:08:33.790
<v Speaker 2>It was like the ultimate and surrender truly of going okay.</v>

288
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:34.540
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't,</v>

289
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.373
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

290
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.690
<v Speaker 2>I need to find a different way to deal with this.</v>

291
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what has led me down the path that,</v>

292
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:41.740
<v Speaker 2>that I am today.</v>

293
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
