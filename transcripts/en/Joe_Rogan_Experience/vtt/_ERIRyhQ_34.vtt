1
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to some old timey music</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day and it was making me think</v>

2
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.480
<v Speaker 1>of how depressing it would be if that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the only music that you could hear.</v>

3
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.860
<v Speaker 1>La La La la La la La David Lynch movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>that David Lynch in his movies,</v>

4
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>he always has those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those songs.</v>

5
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a woman dead in a hotel and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just this</v>

6
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.923
<v Speaker 2>oh</v>

7
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>mansion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The days where that Tuba with a needle</v>

8
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom of my grandfather had one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those in my home in Pelham.</v>

9
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 1>And his Colin Powell in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had an old chronic graft.</v>

10
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.110
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is called right phonograph and they</v>

11
00:00:41.111 --> 00:00:41.944
<v Speaker 1>would play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>classical.</v>

13
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.850
<v Speaker 1>My grandparents never listened to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were Sicilian.</v>

14
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.990
<v Speaker 1>They never listened to music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did your parents or your grandparents</v>

15
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:51.660
<v Speaker 1>have the TV and a cabinet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah Ha.</v>

16
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>And they certainly did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then with the TV would die.</v>

17
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times folks who put the new TV</v>
<v Speaker 1>on top of the cabinet,</v>

18
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>they would keep the tea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cabinet with the blown out TV.</v>

19
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

20
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:03.690
<v Speaker 1>everybody did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

21
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.280
<v Speaker 1>I had a family that never threw anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

22
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>No my night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never ever.</v>

23
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about road cones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to my attic,</v>

24
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:11.410
<v Speaker 1>we find crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had her phone.</v>

25
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phonograph.</v>

26
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Not a chronic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a chronograph,</v>

27
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 1>but they always had a chronograph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

28
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:17.701
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

29
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

30
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Cause I have a chronology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goddammit.</v>

32
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things were crazy.</v>

33
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Like that was how they used to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

34
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:30.531
<v Speaker 1>A Tuba attached to a needle bolts right</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and the speaker must have sounded</v>

35
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>like dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad used to have a dust cover for his</v>

36
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.330
<v Speaker 1>turntable and he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>

37
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>there was a ritual to how you clean your</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lp.</v>

38
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a ritual.</v>

39
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.620
<v Speaker 1>You got to dust it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a special cloth and all the</v>

40
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.463
<v Speaker 1>shit thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

41
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what we take a peek at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucker.</v>

42
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nuts.</v>

43
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I think for people at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it does a really traffic</v>

44
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>cone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

45
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.501
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

46
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Like a big old brass traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A little needles.</v>

47
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I read the Ted Williams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great,</v>

48
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this might've been a myth,</v>

49
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>but the great baseball player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ted Williams,</v>

50
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 1>who could hit a fast ball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit any kind of ball,</v>

51
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>and he apparently could read the label</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a record as it was going around.</v>

52
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.320
<v Speaker 1>His eyes could slow shit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

53
00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

55
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

56
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this is one of those three things you</v>

57
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.053
<v Speaker 1>hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

58
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Like Joe Frazier was in a hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were four flies in the room there,</v>

59
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>the way it was started with the flies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he went and caught them all and he</v>

60
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:27.541
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

61
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:31.910
<v Speaker 1>you flies the fuck out outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy Griffin was telling us that Bruce</v>

62
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.430
<v Speaker 1>Lee's story once it was one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

63
00:02:34.431 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I heard he killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Lee was in a fight with 30 men and</v>

64
00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:40.890
<v Speaker 1>he stood in the center of all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

65
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.281
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

66
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

67
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Where'd you hear this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never,</v>

68
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:45.730
<v Speaker 1>I heard he never wasn't harangue</v>
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

69
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>He would never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never sparred once.</v>

70
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Bruce Lee ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever fight competitive?</v>

71
00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>Was rumored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

72
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>but he did one thing once where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>sparred at like this a karate festival.</v>

73
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>One sparring session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

00:02:59.291 --> 00:02:59.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to be able to read the label on the no.</v>

78
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Good luck to everybody against a guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Darren till that's luck.</v>

<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

<v Speaker 3>V Hypnotism is feet.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You get hypnotized cause you're 100%</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

91
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give into it.</v>

92
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just let it,</v>

93
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 3>let,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let yourself achieve the state.</v>

94
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 3>But you realize what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

95
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got this idea where like someone</v>

96
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 3>can like turn you into Manchurian</v>
<v Speaker 3>candidate if they hypnotize you and you</v>

97
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't have to troll your brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

98
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

99
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.961
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

100
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 3>You're relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

101
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 3>You're relaxing and you're open to</v>
<v Speaker 3>suggestion in an interesting state of</v>

102
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:49.980
<v Speaker 3>mind that you can achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

103
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.260
<v Speaker 3>See like I think just think there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>larger spectrum of the way the mind</v>

104
00:03:57.101 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 3>works then we give it credit for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think what I've been thinking</v>

105
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 3>about this a lot that that's one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that happens with standup.</v>

106
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 3>I think if you're onstage and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing and stand up,</v>

107
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 3>if I'm in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you've got me hypnotized.</v>

108
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm locked up into your line of thinking</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like your act is a very silly,</v>

109
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 3>so like when I'm watching you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I start thinking in silly ways and</v>

110
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:22.300
<v Speaker 3>then you'll keep getting sillier and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sillier and then like I'm locked into</v>

111
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 3>your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's a form of hypnosis,</v>

112
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 3>100% and I think that so is like being</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a good place.</v>

113
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.981
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Young.</v>

114
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Jamie said though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it'd be in a good place mentally.</v>

115
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:34.780
<v Speaker 3>So it was being in a bad place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think there's like,</v>

116
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 3>there's a large spectrum in the mind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different chairs.</v>

117
00:04:39.521 --> 00:04:40.460
<v Speaker 3>Where are you going fucker?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can't.</v>

118
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 3>What kind of staggered was fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cheers dude.</v>

235
00:09:24.211 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 4>he was so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so specific.</v>

236
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm 61 and a half,</v>

237
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:33.441
<v Speaker 4>240 pounds to 245 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was the same size when he played</v>

238
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:35.430
<v Speaker 4>and he never has lifted weights in his</v>
<v Speaker 4>life ever.</v>

239
00:09:35.431 --> 00:09:36.780
<v Speaker 4>And he didn't lift weights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When he play,</v>

240
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.340
<v Speaker 4>he would just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as in his words,</v>

241
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 4>I just strap it on and I'd hear the</v>
<v Speaker 4>other team go on posing the game,</v>

242
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.600
<v Speaker 4>posing in the game.</v>

243
00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.250
<v Speaker 4>But you have to also understand at Bo</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jackson,</v>

244
00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:47.340
<v Speaker 4>not only did whatever you want it to you</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the football field faster and</v>

245
00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:50.340
<v Speaker 4>everybody at two 45 and stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was also a,</v>

246
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:53.410
<v Speaker 4>was he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was he not an MVP in baseball star?</v>

247
00:09:53.411 --> 00:09:56.220
<v Speaker 4>At least start that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's unheard of.</v>

248
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.730
<v Speaker 4>Deion sanders play both ways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's no one like Bo Jackson free.</v>

249
00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Throwing Bibi's,</v>

250
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.510
<v Speaker 4>throwing fucking ropes from center</v>
<v Speaker 4>field.</v>

251
00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:04.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole different,</v>

252
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.120
<v Speaker 4>a whole different kinds of one tackle</v>
<v Speaker 4>one hip injury that's changed all that</v>

253
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:11.170
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it was his hip started to die or</v>

254
00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.380
<v Speaker 4>have some kind of in a crisis in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>bone or something.</v>

255
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.800
<v Speaker 4>Let's from getting hit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a very famous hit that he got</v>

256
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.350
<v Speaker 4>tackled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could see like the impact that has</v>

257
00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Speaker 4>on his hips when he goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least I am I remembering that</v>

258
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:22.290
<v Speaker 4>correctly.</v>

259
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.230
<v Speaker 4>There was a video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

260
00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.073
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

261
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.190
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can see the injury and it's just a</v>

262
00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous half.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we still came back and was smashing</v>

263
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 4>home runs with a fake hip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>came back and played baseball.</v>

264
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.960
<v Speaker 4>Just couldn't really run anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

265
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.300
<v Speaker 4>just a different kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a different kind of wonder if they</v>

266
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:38.400
<v Speaker 4>could fix that hip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you know,</v>

267
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.770
<v Speaker 4>you think about what his hip was then</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what does hip is now?</v>

268
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.130
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you'd have to read,</v>

269
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.700
<v Speaker 4>you have to generate their tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know if we're there yet,</v>

270
00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:47.430
<v Speaker 4>but we're getting close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I mean is like the artificial hips.</v>

271
00:10:47.431 --> 00:10:48.900
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are better now.</v>

272
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't know it did you read a book</v>
<v Speaker 4>called Sapiens?</v>

273
00:10:51.721 --> 00:10:53.070
<v Speaker 4>I sent you a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably not,</v>

274
00:10:53.071 --> 00:10:54.660
<v Speaker 4>but Yuval Harari.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody should read it.</v>

275
00:10:54.661 --> 00:10:57.420
<v Speaker 4>It's an amazing book and it's a brief</v>
<v Speaker 4>history of mankind,</v>

276
00:10:57.421 --> 00:11:01.950
<v Speaker 4>but it brings us to present day and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>also wrote another book called Homo</v>

277
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:02.310
<v Speaker 4>Deus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

278
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.920
<v Speaker 4>When should you send this to me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sent you a screenshot.</v>

279
00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:05.790
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to read this book,</v>

280
00:11:05.791 --> 00:11:07.300
<v Speaker 4>but Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

281
00:11:07.301 --> 00:11:10.440
<v Speaker 4>he talks about where we're headed</v>
<v Speaker 4>technologically.</v>

282
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:14.940
<v Speaker 4>He's really done the research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean really looking honestly at what</v>

283
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:17.410
<v Speaker 4>medical research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what to expect in the next 30 years.</v>

284
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:18.211
<v Speaker 4>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

285
00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:19.044
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

286
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.910
<v Speaker 4>not only are we going to live much</v>
<v Speaker 4>longer if you have the money,</v>

287
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.070
<v Speaker 4>but the real question he ends the book</v>
<v Speaker 4>with in a way is we have to decide as</v>

288
00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:31.650
<v Speaker 4>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the first time in our history,</v>

289
00:11:31.651 --> 00:11:35.640
<v Speaker 4>we can control our own evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we have to ask ourselves what we want</v>

290
00:11:35.641 --> 00:11:39.270
<v Speaker 4>to become.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a really big responsibility.</v>

291
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.670
<v Speaker 4>What do you want to become?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do we want to become?</v>

292
00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:46.710
<v Speaker 4>Because that question can be answered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We will have the technology to answer</v>

293
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:49.650
<v Speaker 4>that question and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it can get silly where you can say,</v>

294
00:11:49.651 --> 00:11:53.070
<v Speaker 4>we could splice our genes with Elian or</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a gorilla.</v>

295
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.093
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

296
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:58.300
<v Speaker 3>more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll be able to splice our genes with</v>

297
00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:02.500
<v Speaker 3>synthetic biology and become what it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a very heavy question.</v>

298
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.420
<v Speaker 3>What do you if so if you want to live</v>
<v Speaker 3>forever,</v>

299
00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:07.090
<v Speaker 3>if you become what he called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a moral,</v>

300
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.960
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or a different word for it.</v>

301
00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:11.140
<v Speaker 3>But we're going to get mad at you for</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking 50 year olds.</v>

302
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Like they don't know anything yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

303
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:16.240
<v Speaker 3>how could you fuck a 50 year old?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be like a thousand years old.</v>

304
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.130
<v Speaker 3>I know you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be so smart.</v>

305
00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:19.680
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so why is people go,</v>

306
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.150
<v Speaker 3>you know how gross you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking someone who's 50 years</v>

307
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:24.250
<v Speaker 3>old as a human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We figured,</v>

308
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we only think of ourselves as like,</v>

309
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should have your shit together by 50</v>

310
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.520
<v Speaker 3>because we know we only lived to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred.</v>

311
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.650
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is most people don't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>their shit together.</v>

312
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 3>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

313
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.230
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a race that nobody's winning.</v>

314
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we all know that if we just,</v>

315
00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:40.540
<v Speaker 3>if we had an infinite amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would keep getting better at getting</v>

316
00:12:40.541 --> 00:12:42.670
<v Speaker 3>our shit together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would not be who you were yesterday</v>

317
00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:44.680
<v Speaker 3>and hopefully you'd be much better than</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were a year ago.</v>

318
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 3>But I think about something different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

319
00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.450
<v Speaker 3>that's the case though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you get to 900 years old,</v>

320
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.400
<v Speaker 3>are you still allowed to bang 50 year</v>
<v Speaker 3>olds?</v>

321
00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.970
<v Speaker 3>Like live?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if she's a fucking kid,</v>

322
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:56.080
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean when is it?</v>

323
00:12:56.081 --> 00:12:59.380
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if she's super hot and vampires,</v>

324
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.380
<v Speaker 3>vampires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck like 30 year olds,</v>

325
00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:02.830
<v Speaker 3>but we're talking about people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

326
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.040
<v Speaker 3>I'll talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're apparently not if you can live,</v>

327
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.830
<v Speaker 3>if they figure out medical science and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not outside the realm of</v>

328
00:13:08.831 --> 00:13:11.560
<v Speaker 3>possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can regenerate tissue and you stem</v>

329
00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:14.260
<v Speaker 3>cells to rejuvenate your body and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>live 900 fucking years old.</v>

330
00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.050
<v Speaker 3>Are you allowed to bank 50 year olds or</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you gross?</v>

331
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes to actually have what I think</v>

332
00:13:20.741 --> 00:13:22.900
<v Speaker 3>the answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes time and it,</v>

333
00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:26.320
<v Speaker 3>and it flips it on its head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean time no longer has a consequence</v>

334
00:13:26.321 --> 00:13:27.880
<v Speaker 3>because there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have very,</v>

335
00:13:27.881 --> 00:13:30.100
<v Speaker 3>you don't really have limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had the biggest thing about human</v>

336
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:30.461
<v Speaker 3>beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

337
00:13:30.461 --> 00:13:32.140
<v Speaker 3>is that we have limitation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know we're going to die.</v>

338
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.920
<v Speaker 3>That's the fundamental difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between sort of a,</v>

339
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:38.240
<v Speaker 3>the idea of a a robot being just like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>human,</v>

340
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.750
<v Speaker 3>we are defined by our limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

341
00:13:40.751 --> 00:13:44.290
<v Speaker 3>But you know why they bring the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the draft around and try to get young</v>

342
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:47.230
<v Speaker 3>people to get drafted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to go out to their 40 year</v>

343
00:13:47.231 --> 00:13:51.100
<v Speaker 3>olds and 50 year olds would think cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>it won't work like a wonder if it gets</v>

344
00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:52.270
<v Speaker 3>to a certain age.</v>

345
00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.540
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if you live to a certain age</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like cults just don't work anymore.</v>

346
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.630
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if it only works up until</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like 50 or 60 or 70 but if people</v>

347
00:13:58.631 --> 00:14:02.620
<v Speaker 3>live forever it would be just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling Santa Claus to like a little</v>

348

364
00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:35.650
<v Speaker 3>It got really hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my point is like there was still</v>

365
00:14:35.651 --> 00:14:39.310
<v Speaker 3>beating me naive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They still put the holy water on</v>

366
00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.540
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They still do.</v>

367
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.830
<v Speaker 3>You know there's going to be awake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>weird shit,</v>

368
00:14:42.831 --> 00:14:45.910
<v Speaker 3>but there'll be attracted to that 900</v>
<v Speaker 3>year old cars full of wisdom</v>

369
00:14:45.911 --> 00:14:47.110
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A sorcerer.</v>

370
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of power you to have your</v>

371
00:14:49.241 --> 00:14:50.830
<v Speaker 3>nine years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you get older,</v>

372
00:14:50.831 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 3>that of life breaks</v>

373
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.540
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're out when you're younger and you'd</v>

374
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:54.590
<v Speaker 1>see somebody who's really good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

375
00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:55.101
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

376
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:57.050
<v Speaker 1>they're a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you kind of get,</v>

377
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.121
<v Speaker 1>you start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

378
00:14:58.121 --> 00:15:00.800
<v Speaker 1>you get to a certain days where you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at something or you just start to</v>

379
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.400
<v Speaker 1>do it enough and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain formula to success.</v>

380
00:15:04.401 --> 00:15:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes like it to be really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at something.</v>

381
00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

382
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.320
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a mindset for competition.</v>

383
00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:13.100
<v Speaker 1>But to be really good at something also</v>
<v Speaker 1>just requires a shitload of repetition</v>

384
00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:15.800
<v Speaker 1>and good toodle edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of touching,</v>

385
00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.560
<v Speaker 1>a lot of focus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that you recognize</v>

386
00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:22.280
<v Speaker 1>in people when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see another enough people that are</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

389
00:15:27.891 --> 00:15:32.891

<v Speaker 1>because I have zero talent cause I have</v>

390
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:35.870

465
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:09.681
<v Speaker 4>And it turned out that they had a</v>
<v Speaker 4>dominant tone so that their tone and the</v>

466
00:19:10.291 --> 00:19:13.530
<v Speaker 4>sound of their voice was what people</v>
<v Speaker 4>objected to.</v>

467
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.440
<v Speaker 4>And because their bedside manner was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>saddle,</v>

468
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.340
<v Speaker 4>Malcolm Gladwell's book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their bedside manner was,</v>

469
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.990
<v Speaker 4>was dominant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They weren't,</v>

470
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.180
<v Speaker 4>they weren't sort of understanding and</v>
<v Speaker 4>listening.</v>

471
00:19:24.181 --> 00:19:26.310
<v Speaker 4>They were rather telling the patient</v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

472
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.040
<v Speaker 4>Those were the doctors regardless of</v>
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

473
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.410
<v Speaker 4>their errors and what they did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

474
00:19:31.411 --> 00:19:32.910
<v Speaker 4>that had nothing to do with their</v>
<v Speaker 4>degrees.</v>

475
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.800
<v Speaker 4>Didn't even have do with it what they</v>
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>

476
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.780
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those were the ones that got sued for</v>

477
00:19:36.781 --> 00:19:37.770
<v Speaker 4>malpractice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't remember.</v>

478
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:38.790
<v Speaker 4>That's from blink,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

479
00:19:38.791 --> 00:19:40.530
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's from blank blinks are great</v>

480
00:19:40.531 --> 00:19:41.041
<v Speaker 4>book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

481
00:19:41.041 --> 00:19:41.940
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

482
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.090
<v Speaker 4>And it's a great audio book too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got that one on audio book.</v>

483
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.490
<v Speaker 4>I listened to it on audio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very,</v>

484
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.250
<v Speaker 4>I always listen to shit on audio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I listened to Sapiens on audio.</v>

485
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.810
<v Speaker 4>It's very good drive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

486
00:19:51.811 --> 00:19:54.000
<v Speaker 4>it's very good way to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

487
00:19:54.001 --> 00:19:57.000
<v Speaker 4>I like podcasts but I like to mix it up</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

488
00:19:57.001 --> 00:19:58.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to only watch</v>
<v Speaker 4>documentaries.</v>

489
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.700
<v Speaker 4>I like watching fiction too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

490
00:20:00.701 --> 00:20:01.890
<v Speaker 4>work watching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

491
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.040
<v Speaker 4>I like to mix things up with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with would I take in and what have you.</v>

492
00:20:05.041 --> 00:20:07.950
<v Speaker 4>But I think that like audio books in</v>
<v Speaker 4>particular,</v>

493
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.040
<v Speaker 4>it's a great way to utilize like wasted</v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

494
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>100%.</v>

495
00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.710
<v Speaker 4>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead of listening to music.</v>

496
00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:16.080
<v Speaker 4>I always listened to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I listen to a whole course on Nietzsche</v>

497
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.660
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how crazy was that story and blink about</v>

498
00:20:18.661 --> 00:20:23.661
<v Speaker 4>the artwork where they found this good</v>
<v Speaker 4>statue and this art expert looked at it</v>

499
00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:25.890
<v Speaker 4>for a second and went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fake.</v>

500
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.760
<v Speaker 4>How much would you be or what came to</v>
<v Speaker 4>his mind back?</v>

501
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.670
<v Speaker 4>Remember the word that came to what he</v>
<v Speaker 4>says?</v>

502
00:20:29.671 --> 00:20:32.100
<v Speaker 4>Nay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knew it was fake because new,</v>

503
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:36.240
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>close when it was supposed to be up.</v>

504
00:20:36.241 --> 00:20:38.630
<v Speaker 4>Statute was buried for 3000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A Kudos,</v>

505
00:20:38.631 --> 00:20:40.980
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a fully formed Kudos is young boy</v>

506
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:43.260
<v Speaker 4>in Greek,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's a fully formed like statute,</v>

507
00:20:43.261 --> 00:20:45.300
<v Speaker 4>which is near a thessaloniki or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

508
00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 4>And they tested the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the marble</v>

509
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.550
<v Speaker 3>came from Macquarie near there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They even tested the mold,</v>

510
00:20:51.551 --> 00:20:53.200
<v Speaker 3>which actually turned out to be somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it on potatoes,</v>

511
00:20:53.201 --> 00:20:55.180
<v Speaker 3>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the mold seemed legit and all that</v>

512
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:57.010
<v Speaker 3>stuff and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

513
00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.120
<v Speaker 3>the minute he saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

514
00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:00.670
<v Speaker 3>can you get your money back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a fake.</v>

515
00:21:00.671 --> 00:21:02.620
<v Speaker 3>And he didn't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the first word that came to mind was</v>

516
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:04.060
<v Speaker 3>fresh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fresh,</v>

517
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.230
<v Speaker 3>kind of crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

518
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mason something you're supposed to here,</v>

519
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:08.530
<v Speaker 3>but isn't it crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was right.</v>

520
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you could just see like for you and</v>

521
00:21:11.081 --> 00:21:12.130
<v Speaker 3>I would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

522
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.750
<v Speaker 3>crazy statue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

523
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.140
<v Speaker 3>We wouldn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's certain things that I'm sure</v>

524
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:18.190
<v Speaker 3>you could see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

525
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.880
<v Speaker 3>like there's certain things like here's</v>
<v Speaker 3>one that I see all the time.</v>

526
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:25.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see when people are about to spin from</v>

527

<v Speaker 3>All the time.</v>

531
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.580
<v Speaker 3>Because you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you learn it when you're a little</v>

532
00:21:33.581 --> 00:21:34.900

533
00:21:34.901 --> 00:21:36.760
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it becomes a part of your life.</v>

<v Speaker 3>and you see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a regular person,</v>

537
00:21:42.941 --> 00:21:44.170
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck are you seeing that?</v>

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when you see that,</v>

541
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:49.061
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

542
00:21:49.061 --> 00:21:49.920
<v Speaker 3>get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

543
00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.710
<v Speaker 3>Well one of the wealthiest guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend who made $1 billion more,</v>

544
00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:56.830
<v Speaker 3>his buddy is worth some crazy amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

545
00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.170
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what's your secret?</v>

546
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.093
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

547
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 3>mirrors and windows.</v>

548
00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:02.200
<v Speaker 3>So what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

549
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:04.420
<v Speaker 3>I can tell if somebody is going to pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>me back.</v>

550
00:22:04.421 --> 00:22:06.100
<v Speaker 3>I can tell if somebody is a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>investment or not.</v>

551
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.191
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well how?</v>

552
00:22:07.191 --> 00:22:08.350
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to got windows,</v>

553
00:22:08.351 --> 00:22:09.980
<v Speaker 3>you've got mirrors for eyes and if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>got married,</v>

554
00:22:09.981 --> 00:22:11.080
<v Speaker 3>surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go fuck yourself.</v>

555
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:13.570
<v Speaker 3>You've got windows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a lending money and that's an</v>

556
00:22:13.571 --> 00:22:16.750
<v Speaker 3>instinct he would just pick up on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got [inaudible] Saturday and he could</v>

557
00:22:16.751 --> 00:22:18.700
<v Speaker 3>pick up on whether or not you were a</v>
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>

558
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.300
<v Speaker 3>You know that's a real problem with</v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating with people in nonverbal</v>

559
00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:26.950
<v Speaker 3>ways in non purse non-face-to-face ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

560
00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.650
<v Speaker 3>it's a real problem with like texting</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff like that.</v>

561
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.100
<v Speaker 3>You're not looking into the person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I think it changes the way we talk</v>

562
00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:34.840
<v Speaker 3>to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It changes interactions.</v>

563
00:22:34.841 --> 00:22:37.990
<v Speaker 3>And I think most of the problem that</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have most of the time with each</v>

564
00:22:37.991 --> 00:22:40.600
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not talking like today and</v>

565
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.570
<v Speaker 3>especially not talking enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at each other in the eyes.</v>

566
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.400
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly figuring out like if</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe someone's,</v>

567
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.670
<v Speaker 3>someone's right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you're wrong about something.</v>

568
00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:48.970
<v Speaker 3>You got to talk to them and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

569
00:22:48.971 --> 00:22:50.680
<v Speaker 3>well when did you think I was supposed</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do?</v>

570
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.090
<v Speaker 3>And I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

571
00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:53.890
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what time were you supposed to be</v>

572
00:22:53.891 --> 00:22:55.270
<v Speaker 3>there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What time did we say?</v>

573
00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.750
<v Speaker 3>I thought we said this and you can try</v>
<v Speaker 3>to figure it out while you're looking at</v>

574
00:22:58.751 --> 00:22:59.584
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

575
00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:01.000
<v Speaker 3>You know when someone gets say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look man,</v>

576
00:23:01.001 --> 00:23:04.180
<v Speaker 3>I was really bummed out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know it was a really important</v>

577
00:23:04.181 --> 00:23:06.370
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was supposed to pick me up and then</v>

578
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.520
<v Speaker 3>you could work it out and look at each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other and work with that.</v>

579
00:23:08.521 --> 00:23:10.840
<v Speaker 3>But when you go through these series of</v>
<v Speaker 3>text messages,</v>

580
00:23:10.841 --> 00:23:13.060
<v Speaker 3>I've had text messaged discussions with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are like,</v>

581
00:23:13.061 --> 00:23:14.530
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't do this.</v>

582
00:23:14.531 --> 00:23:15.970
<v Speaker 3>Like let's just talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we just talk,</v>

583
00:23:15.971 --> 00:23:19.240
<v Speaker 3>cause this is crazy cause I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>what your face is making when you're</v>

584
00:23:19.241 --> 00:23:22.330
<v Speaker 3>making the statement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying something and it's not</v>

585
00:23:22.331 --> 00:23:25.300
<v Speaker 3>entirely accurate and I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out what the fuck your face looks</v>

586
00:23:25.301 --> 00:23:26.500
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are you laughing?</v>

587
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.890
<v Speaker 3>Is this lol right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We look at each other cause I bet we</v>

588
00:23:29.891 --> 00:23:31.740
<v Speaker 3>could work this shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that that's,</v>

589
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:36.750
<v Speaker 3>that is the problem with reading</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes about something and thinking</v>

590
00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:40.210
<v Speaker 3>you're getting the whole picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I like about Thaddeus Russell is</v>

591
00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:42.610
<v Speaker 3>that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his book or renegade history of the</v>

592
00:23:42.611 --> 00:23:43.570
<v Speaker 3>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called,</v>

593
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.650
<v Speaker 3>he actually takes a look at</v>

594
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.680
<v Speaker 4>things that I've never heard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a history major and historians</v>

595
00:23:48.681 --> 00:23:52.040
<v Speaker 4>tend to be pretty conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stodgy people,</v>

596
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:52.691
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

597
00:23:52.691 --> 00:23:53.660
<v Speaker 4>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

598
00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.050
<v Speaker 4>but your average college professor is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty conservative guy.</v>

599
00:23:57.051 --> 00:24:00.200
<v Speaker 4>Even though he might be very left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're conservative people.</v>

600
00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:01.370
<v Speaker 4>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not,</v>

601
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.490
<v Speaker 4>they're not young.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to find them at an orgy or</v>

602
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:05.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>usually or various things.</v>

603
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.870
<v Speaker 4>And especially with historians and when</v>
<v Speaker 4>they write history,</v>

604
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.380
<v Speaker 4>they always write it from this really</v>
<v Speaker 4>stodgy kind of,</v>

605
00:24:12.381 --> 00:24:16.010
<v Speaker 4>you hear about the events,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you actually don't hear about what it</v>

606
00:24:16.011 --> 00:24:19.040
<v Speaker 4>was like in the brothels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't hear about what it smelled</v>

607
00:24:19.041 --> 00:24:21.620
<v Speaker 4>like in the bars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't hear about the noise.</v>

608
00:24:21.621 --> 00:24:25.820
<v Speaker 4>You don't hear about things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually have an effect on people.</v>

609
00:24:25.821 --> 00:24:28.010
<v Speaker 4>Who are the criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how safe are the streets?</v>

610
00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:30.470
<v Speaker 4>Where were the prostitutes who was</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually getting laid?</v>

611
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:34.520
<v Speaker 4>Was there a lot of black and white sex</v>
<v Speaker 4>that went on in during the revolutionary</v>

612
00:24:34.521 --> 00:24:36.980
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which apparently there was a,</v>

613
00:24:36.981 --> 00:24:39.860
<v Speaker 4>what about dancing on a dirty white</v>
<v Speaker 4>ladies?</v>

614
00:24:39.861 --> 00:24:41.750
<v Speaker 4>It got some dark Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I only,</v>

615
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:45.260
<v Speaker 4>I can only hope I co it's the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck you to your dad.</v>

616
00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.570
<v Speaker 4>Yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes it is.</v>

617
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.720
<v Speaker 4>How many chicks just fucking couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait.</v>

618
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.410
<v Speaker 4>I know as soon as it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the veil was lifted,</v>

619
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as they say,</v>

620
00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:01.240
<v Speaker 4>my dad is fighting to keep you asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fine to suck your Dick Dave.</v>

621
00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.660
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like a title little hot dirty</v>
<v Speaker 4>white girl with freckles.</v>

622
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.370
<v Speaker 4>Apparently there was a lot of that</v>
<v Speaker 4>because what they would do is the Irish</v>

623
00:25:10.371 --> 00:25:12.020
<v Speaker 4>who come in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were indentured servants.</v>

624
00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.240
<v Speaker 4>Then you have this black slaves and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>danced.</v>

625
00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:16.070
<v Speaker 4>They would go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there'd be like these,</v>

626
00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.650
<v Speaker 4>these speakeasies and everybody would</v>
<v Speaker 4>mingle.</v>

627
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.890
<v Speaker 4>It'd be late at night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>black but beautiful black women and you</v>

628
00:25:21.891 --> 00:25:23.480
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the black and white dudes be like,</v>

629
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:24.440
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these girls are hot.</v>

630
00:25:24.441 --> 00:25:26.420
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there was mixing and everything else</v>

631
00:25:26.421 --> 00:25:28.100
<v Speaker 4>and there was all kinds of shit like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

632
00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:32.120
<v Speaker 4>Remember slavery was being talked about</v>
<v Speaker 4>is I'm great moral evil.</v>

633
00:25:32.121 --> 00:25:34.610
<v Speaker 4>Really back when this country was</v>
<v Speaker 4>founded,</v>

634
00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.640
<v Speaker 4>what really kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things they say that kept</v>

635
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:40.850
<v Speaker 4>slavery going another hundred years was</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cotton gin,</v>

636
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:45.320
<v Speaker 4>was the fact that Eli Whitney invented a</v>
<v Speaker 4>machine that made it fucking really,</v>

637
00:25:45.321 --> 00:25:48.590
<v Speaker 4>really easy to separate the seed from</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cotton.</v>

638
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:50.990
<v Speaker 4>And as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy comes up with a great invention</v>

639
00:25:50.991 --> 00:25:51.651
<v Speaker 4>and it's rough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

640
00:25:51.651 --> 00:25:54.140
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got all this free labor down here.</v>

641
00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm not free and slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This shit is white gold.</v>

642
00:25:56.541 --> 00:25:57.890
<v Speaker 4>I can send it over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can send it to Europe,</v>

643
00:25:57.891 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 4>and there's an insatiable demand for my</v>
<v Speaker 4>cotton fuck that I'm not going to have.</v>

644
00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.010
<v Speaker 4>My whole economy is built on the fact</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I've got all this free labor and</v>

645
00:26:04.011 --> 00:26:07.130
<v Speaker 4>I'm making a fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of historians kind of talk</v>

646
00:26:07.131 --> 00:26:11.070
<v Speaker 4>about how Eli Whitney invented a machine</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was really efficient but might've</v>

647
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:15.740
<v Speaker 4>been responsible for keeping an entire</v>
<v Speaker 4>group of people in slavery for.</v>

648
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.450
<v Speaker 4>That is so crazy to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

649
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.110
<v Speaker 4>you came up with an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He came up with a cotton gin,</v>

650
00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:22.940
<v Speaker 4>most of the clothes that were made out</v>
<v Speaker 4>of hemp,</v>

651
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.620
<v Speaker 4>hemp fiber for everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and apparently it's way better than</v>

652
00:26:27.621 --> 00:26:29.620
<v Speaker 4>cotton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's stronger for sure.</v>

653
00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:32.990
<v Speaker 4>I stronger todd mccormick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do remember my friend Tom Mccormick,</v>

654
00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:38.290
<v Speaker 4>he had this stock of hemp in his house</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was like from a hemp tree and</v>

655
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:40.790
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's from another planet.</v>

656
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.370
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem like it's a real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so really</v>

657
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.370
<v Speaker 7>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's really light.</v>

658
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:49.440
<v Speaker 7>It's light like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like Balsa wood,</v>

659
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.910
<v Speaker 7>but it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

660
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.070
<v Speaker 7>oh cool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like it's weird.</v>

661
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:54.900
<v Speaker 7>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he was explaining to me,</v>

662
00:26:54.901 --> 00:26:57.180
<v Speaker 7>and he knows way more about me than I</v>
<v Speaker 7>do,</v>

663
00:26:57.181 --> 00:26:57.841
<v Speaker 7>but he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dude,</v>

664
00:26:57.841 --> 00:27:00.750
<v Speaker 7>it's an alien planet and it's an error</v>
<v Speaker 7>on the alien planet.</v>

665
00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.450
<v Speaker 7>It's very hearty.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We'd write an alien plant.</v>

666
00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:07.140
<v Speaker 7>It's like no other plant.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It has all the essential amino acids.</v>

667
00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.360
<v Speaker 7>You,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you get essential oils from it.</v>

668
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.090
<v Speaker 7>It has protein in it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a very high protein content.</v>

669
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.340
<v Speaker 7>Like you can eat hemp seeds are great</v>
<v Speaker 7>for you,</v>

670
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.610
<v Speaker 7>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're really healthy and you can make</v>

671
00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:21.150
<v Speaker 7>clothing out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can make fuel out of it.</v>

672
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:23.850
<v Speaker 7>Hemp fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Henry Ford made the first fenders on the</v>

673
00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:26.820
<v Speaker 7>first model t out of Ham.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fiber's really an,</v>

674
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:30.660
<v Speaker 7>there's a video of him hitting them with</v>
<v Speaker 7>a hammer and the hammer bounces off.</v>

675
00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:34.140
<v Speaker 7>These hemp vendors,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're far more durable than steel.</v>

676
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.170
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's an insane fiber man.</v>

677
00:27:37.171 --> 00:27:40.500
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It literally is like no other fiber on</v>

678
00:27:40.501 --> 00:27:44.280
<v Speaker 7>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a really complex fiber and it's</v>

679
00:27:44.281 --> 00:27:46.880
<v Speaker 7>illegal and it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can go home,</v>

680
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:50.010
<v Speaker 7>can't you grow hemp.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You just can't grow the female plant and</v>

681
00:27:50.011 --> 00:27:54.570
<v Speaker 7>the government is doing their best to</v>
<v Speaker 7>make cbds being regulated by the FDA.</v>

682
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.630
<v Speaker 7>They're all trying to stop CB.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's people that are trying to stop</v>

683
00:27:57.631 --> 00:27:59.430
<v Speaker 7>cbd.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't even have a psychoactive</v>

684
00:27:59.431 --> 00:28:00.420
<v Speaker 7>effect on you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

685
00:28:00.421 --> 00:28:02.120
<v Speaker 7>the guy who invented that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

686
00:28:02.121 --> 00:28:03.780
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if he had vetted the dark</v>
<v Speaker 7>web,</v>

687
00:28:03.781 --> 00:28:05.100
<v Speaker 7>but the the Silk Road Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

688
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.880
<v Speaker 7>brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

689
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.190
<v Speaker 7>I got to point this out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is really important though.</v>

690
00:28:08.191 --> 00:28:10.170
<v Speaker 7>Before I forget,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the CBD oil folks,</v>

691
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.320
<v Speaker 7>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm reading a lot of reports online of</v>

692
00:28:13.321 --> 00:28:15.960
<v Speaker 7>people testing cbd and it tests positive</v>
<v Speaker 7>for thc.</v>

693
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.800
<v Speaker 7>Greg Fitzsimmons talked about this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He said that he tried cbd oil and he got</v>

694
00:28:19.801 --> 00:28:21.960
<v Speaker 7>him high.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know what he used,</v>

695
00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:24.000
<v Speaker 7>which company he used,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the,</v>

696
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.490
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the studies that I've read where people</v>

697
00:28:26.491 --> 00:28:28.840
<v Speaker 7>have actually got them tested,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's,</v>

698
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.410
<v Speaker 7>there's thc in some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so you've gotta be careful,</v>

699
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:34.230
<v Speaker 7>especially if you have some ups job or</v>
<v Speaker 7>somewhere that,</v>

700
00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:37.830
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if ups tests where they</v>
<v Speaker 7>test your piss.</v>

701
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.590
<v Speaker 7>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you take cbd oil for pain and</v>

702
00:28:40.591 --> 00:28:42.510
<v Speaker 7>inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've got to really make sure you trust</v>

703
00:28:42.511 --> 00:28:45.120
<v Speaker 7>the sources because I guess apparently</v>
<v Speaker 7>it can,</v>

704
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.670
<v Speaker 7>it can have thc in it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>When you didn't you point that out.</v>

705
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen that same thing for two</v>

706
00:28:51.101 --> 00:28:52.690
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're the one who told me about</v>

707
00:28:52.691 --> 00:28:53.710
<v Speaker 3>it first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

708
00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.410
<v Speaker 3>It's not just cause we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about Greg,</v>

709
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.300
<v Speaker 3>like Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's high off CBD oil.</v>

710
00:28:58.301 --> 00:29:00.880
<v Speaker 3>Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like maybe it's just like a super</v>

711
00:29:00.881 --> 00:29:03.100
<v Speaker 3>lightweight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think so.</v>

712
00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.260
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some weed and some of</v>

713
00:29:05.261 --> 00:29:07.270
<v Speaker 3>them I think might just be super</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitive.</v>

714
00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:08.500
<v Speaker 3>I love the weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

715
00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:11.440
<v Speaker 3>I think if you just give him a regular</v>
<v Speaker 3>cbd oil,</v>

716
00:29:11.441 --> 00:29:13.780
<v Speaker 3>Betty be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might not even just be the CBD oil.</v>

717
00:29:13.781 --> 00:29:17.050
<v Speaker 3>I have noticed a something like head</v>
<v Speaker 3>shops and some states that it's not</v>

718
00:29:17.051 --> 00:29:20.110
<v Speaker 3>recreationally available.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're selling it in the same form as</v>

719
00:29:20.111 --> 00:29:24.580
<v Speaker 3>like dabs and concentrates and you smoke</v>
<v Speaker 3>the CBD the same way you would smoke</v>

720
00:29:24.581 --> 00:29:26.560
<v Speaker 3>that heavy concentrated shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

721
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:29.290
<v Speaker 3>And that crazy like dab rig with a hot</v>
<v Speaker 3>torch.</v>

722
00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.430
<v Speaker 3>So you smoke cbd oil that doesn't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>you high and the Dab rig and that,</v>

723
00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is to sleep better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work.</v>

724
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.560
<v Speaker 3>It didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you what works.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's interesting sometimes it just,</v>

733
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:59.910
<v Speaker 3>I feel guilty about being so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get into my really soft bed and I do</v>

734
00:30:00.671 --> 00:30:02.800
<v Speaker 3>what I love and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does the other foot gonna drop</v>

735
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:04.930
<v Speaker 3>here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you really stop and think about how</v>

736
00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:08.960
<v Speaker 3>lucky you are in comparison to the vast</v>
<v Speaker 3>majority of human doings are,</v>

737
00:30:08.961 --> 00:30:11.080
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you know.</v>

738
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

739
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.730
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

740
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:17.260
<v Speaker 3>I have zero tolerance for people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about how hard things are today.</v>

741
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Like they're complicated today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

742
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.250
<v Speaker 3>They're not hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's complicated.</v>

743
00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way More complicated.</v>

744
00:30:22.391 --> 00:30:24.220
<v Speaker 3>Of course there are hard moments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's,</v>

745
00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.370
<v Speaker 3>no one's denying your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your pain and your hard moments.</v>

746
00:30:27.371 --> 00:30:29.440
<v Speaker 3>If you get a cut on your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to get gang green.</v>

747
00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just way easier.</v>

748
00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.800
<v Speaker 3>A little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to worry about the,</v>

749
00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:35.980
<v Speaker 3>the pox.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so much more today.</v>

750
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.250
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a fucking crazy time and</v>

751
00:30:39.251 --> 00:30:40.270
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's still,</v>

752
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.240
<v Speaker 3>the thing about this time is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the good thing about it is,</v>

753
00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:44.860
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're overpopulated.</v>

754
00:30:44.861 --> 00:30:45.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're crazy.</v>

755
00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:48.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the system we were operating on.</v>

756
00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:51.160
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't make a whole lot of sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you could still go into the woods at</v>

757
00:30:51.161 --> 00:30:53.020
<v Speaker 3>any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a place where you can go</v>

758
00:30:53.021 --> 00:30:54.760
<v Speaker 3>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can go in the woods.</v>

759
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.310
<v Speaker 3>Like you could go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go to big bear and you just go</v>

760
00:30:57.311 --> 00:30:58.120
<v Speaker 3>for a hike.</v>

761
00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.350
<v Speaker 3>Also in you're in the forest like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

762
00:30:59.351 --> 00:31:00.970
<v Speaker 3>this shit's still real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still,</v>

763
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.530
<v Speaker 3>this is still here too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

764
00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.300
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yay.</v>

765
00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life is crazy and life's bizarre,</v>

766
00:31:04.811 --> 00:31:07.780
<v Speaker 3>but we haven't completely turned the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole world into a city.</v>

767
00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:10.240
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guess what bitch that's coming.</v>

768
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:15.460
<v Speaker 3>We looked out big Los Angeles is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's much of it is covered in concrete</v>

769
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.040
<v Speaker 3>and streets and then the streets go off</v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere,</v>

770
00:31:18.041 --> 00:31:20.110
<v Speaker 3>like veins and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh by the way,</v>

771
00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:22.710
<v Speaker 3>200 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no streets aren't there,</v>

772
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:25.420
<v Speaker 3>but are in town.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll admins is expanding in this</v>

773
00:31:25.421 --> 00:31:26.890
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that wrong?</v>

774
00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.260
<v Speaker 3>I do not think that wildernesses are</v>
<v Speaker 3>expand.</v>

775
00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:31.040
<v Speaker 3>There's more grazing land and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

776
00:31:31.041 --> 00:31:32.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're definitely suffering from</v>

777
00:31:32.711 --> 00:31:35.680
<v Speaker 3>urban sprawl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was surprised to see how little,</v>

778
00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:40.000
<v Speaker 3>like the percentage of of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>continental United States has actually</v>

779
00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.000
<v Speaker 3>inhabited that actually has houses and</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

780
00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:44.590
<v Speaker 3>it was really small.</v>

781
00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:46.030
<v Speaker 3>It surprised me that she had added me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

782
00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:46.930
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super.</v>

783
00:31:46.931 --> 00:31:49.220
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy how 6% or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

784
00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:51.100
<v Speaker 3>and these little areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

785
00:31:51.101 --> 00:31:56.101
<v Speaker 3>I'm like these people that live in these</v>
<v Speaker 3>small towns all across the country does</v>

786
00:31:57.641 --> 00:31:59.230
<v Speaker 3>a big reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also why trump won.</v>

787
00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:03.490
<v Speaker 3>They just felt totally unrepresented by</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the people that live on the sides.</v>

788
00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:07.810
<v Speaker 3>I also think it's because they had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think 50% of Americans have what,</v>

789
00:32:07.811 --> 00:32:10.030
<v Speaker 3>$500 in their bank account?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something crazy.</v>

790
00:32:10.031 --> 00:32:11.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She might be less than that.</v>

791
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:15.490
<v Speaker 3>$400 it's $400 think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why I get mad when people</v>

792
00:32:15.491 --> 00:32:16.600
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like trump,</v>

793
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.780
<v Speaker 3>but I never liked when people</v>
<v Speaker 3>characterized all trump supporters as</v>

794
00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:20.710
<v Speaker 3>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera.</v>

795
00:32:20.711 --> 00:32:24.700
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was unfair because I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>the majority of people want to live in</v>

796
00:32:24.701 --> 00:32:26.740
<v Speaker 3>some dignity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they had Obama,</v>

797
00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.240
<v Speaker 3>eight years of Obama say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you will.</v>

798
00:32:28.241 --> 00:32:30.280
<v Speaker 3>But their lives didn't change for a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of reasons.</v>

799
00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:32.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't think Obama's to blame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of reasons.</v>

800
00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.920
<v Speaker 3>And then along comes hilary's speaking</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same exact language.</v>

801
00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.200
<v Speaker 3>So if you're going to blame people for</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

802
00:32:38.201 --> 00:32:39.740
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under eight years,</v>

803
00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 3>I still</v>

804
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.370
<v Speaker 7>only have $400 in my pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here comes a woman who's speaking the</v>

805
00:32:43.371 --> 00:32:44.510
<v Speaker 7>same language.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

806
00:32:44.511 --> 00:32:46.180
<v Speaker 7>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's a lot of rumors about being or</v>

807
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:47.930
<v Speaker 7>being corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have nothing to lose.</v>

808
00:32:47.931 --> 00:32:50.690
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to try that other guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did you see what Donna Brazil rope?</v>

809
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Speaker 7>One of the reasons why she came out with</v>
<v Speaker 7>their book is after seth rich got</v>

810
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:57.260
<v Speaker 7>murdered and she called him a patriot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

811
00:32:58.490 --> 00:32:59.930
<v Speaker 7>I didn't have seth rich got,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

812
00:32:59.931 --> 00:33:00.591
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's right.</v>

813
00:33:00.591 --> 00:33:03.500
<v Speaker 7>That was the guy worked for the DNC.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was a Bernie Sanders supporter</v>

814
00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:07.160
<v Speaker 7>that wikileaks has alluded to the fact</v>
<v Speaker 7>that he them information and got shot in</v>

815
00:33:07.161 --> 00:33:10.370
<v Speaker 7>front of his house and it became this</v>
<v Speaker 7>big conspiracy theory where people would</v>

816
00:33:10.371 --> 00:33:14.330
<v Speaker 7>mock you for saying it was a conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then hannity ran with it and so it</v>

817
00:33:14.331 --> 00:33:18.200
<v Speaker 7>became clearly there for a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 7>that seth rich conspiracy theory that it</v>

818
00:33:18.201 --> 00:33:19.034
<v Speaker 7>was nonsense.</v>

819
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.860
<v Speaker 7>Nobody knows what happened to that guy</v>
<v Speaker 7>though he was murdered,</v>

820
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:25.460
<v Speaker 7>his watch on his phone with him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He had his wallet on him.</v>

821
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.070
<v Speaker 7>Nobody took anything from,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they shot him at four o'clock in the</v>

822
00:33:28.071 --> 00:33:29.840
<v Speaker 7>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who knows what happened.</v>

823
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:35.080
<v Speaker 7>But when wikileaks starts saying that</v>
<v Speaker 7>you gave them information and that</v>

824
00:33:35.721 --> 00:33:37.550
<v Speaker 7>there's consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do you give them information?</v>

825
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:40.220
<v Speaker 7>One of two things is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Either wikileaks has decided,</v>

826
00:33:40.221 --> 00:33:44.780
<v Speaker 7>all of a sudden you start lying right</v>
<v Speaker 7>and making things up about people or</v>

827
00:33:44.781 --> 00:33:47.060
<v Speaker 7>two,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they were misinformed and someone was</v>

828
00:33:47.061 --> 00:33:49.760
<v Speaker 7>pretending to be this guy and sending</v>
<v Speaker 7>them information.</v>

829
00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.550
<v Speaker 7>It's always possible if they can meet</v>
<v Speaker 7>face to face or three,</v>

830
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:56.660
<v Speaker 7>they're telling you something you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 7>know that this guy who was just shot and</v>

831
00:33:56.661 --> 00:34:01.661
<v Speaker 7>murdered was leaking information about</v>
<v Speaker 7>the DNC and other DNC was corrupted by</v>

832
00:34:02.361 --> 00:34:05.990
<v Speaker 7>the Hillary Clinton group,</v>
<v Speaker 7>which is what Donna Brazil is saying in</v>

833
00:34:05.991 --> 00:34:10.940
<v Speaker 7>her book and that this guy released that</v>
<v Speaker 7>and showed how the primaries were rigged</v>

834
00:34:10.941 --> 00:34:14.750
<v Speaker 7>against Bernie Sanders and that Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 7>Ari was sending me excerpts from it the</v>

835
00:34:14.751 --> 00:34:15.560
<v Speaker 7>other day.</v>

836
00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.161
<v Speaker 7>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dude,</v>

837
00:34:16.161 --> 00:34:18.290
<v Speaker 7>she was Donna.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Brazil was saying that Hillary was in</v>

838
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.960
<v Speaker 7>control at DNC before the primaries,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so,</v>

839
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:24.560
<v Speaker 7>so is the implication that Hillary might</v>
<v Speaker 7>have had something to do with his</v>

840
00:34:24.561 --> 00:34:26.540
<v Speaker 7>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's the implication.</v>

841
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.580
<v Speaker 7>The information was already out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I like maybe add more and maybe they</v>

842
00:34:31.581 --> 00:34:34.010
<v Speaker 7>were punishing him to stop other people</v>
<v Speaker 7>from doing the same thing.</v>

843
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:36.680
<v Speaker 7>Maybe other people had more information,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

844
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.540
<v Speaker 7>I don't know if it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there was another guy that</v>

845
00:34:38.541 --> 00:34:41.060
<v Speaker 7>disappeared reasonably.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a guy who,</v>

846
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:42.980
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>had dirt on the Clintons.</v>

847
00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:44.210
<v Speaker 7>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some guy vanished.</v>

848
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:46.130
<v Speaker 7>This is like really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>really recent.</v>

849
00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.540
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>see if you could find that one.</v>

850
00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.810
<v Speaker 7>Some guy just read,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just type in Google Clinton dirt.</v>

851
00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:53.060
<v Speaker 7>And this is like from Newsweek.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there's,</v>

852
00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.420
<v Speaker 7>people have vanished and I dunno how</v>
<v Speaker 7>many of them had been murdered.</v>

853
00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.060
<v Speaker 7>People suicide themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how many of them actually</v>

854
00:34:59.061 --> 00:35:01.690
<v Speaker 7>suicide themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it could,</v>

855
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:06.470
<v Speaker 7>let's just say one out of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just one out of 10.</v>

856
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:07.940
<v Speaker 7>It was an actual murder,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

857
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:11.420
<v Speaker 7>This guy academic at the heart of</v>
<v Speaker 7>Clinton dirt campaign vanishes.</v>

858
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:14.090
<v Speaker 7>What leaving trail of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's really recently.</v>

859
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:16.280
<v Speaker 7>See that figured out when you kill</v>
<v Speaker 7>people.</v>

860
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:20.390
<v Speaker 7>It's my piece way hearts to maybe</v>
<v Speaker 7>usually heal people.</v>

861
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.670
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like God damn,</v>

862
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:24.980
<v Speaker 7>how does body get here?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But when people just vanish,</v>

863
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.710
<v Speaker 7>tamp,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they just vanish.</v>

864
00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.970
<v Speaker 7>Oof.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>

865
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.600
<v Speaker 7>They just disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What does that do when I need him?</v>

866
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:36.560
<v Speaker 7>Whereas Mr Bravo and I made him crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He be going crazy about that one.</v>

867
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.501
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but Eddie's,</v>

868
00:35:37.501 --> 00:35:38.050
<v Speaker 7>Eddie's</v>

869
00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:40.860
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies turn in on themselves</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he'd be like,</v>

870
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.990
<v Speaker 3>he's disappeared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's not really.</v>

871
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:47.880
<v Speaker 3>What if he's not really dead?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie?</v>

872
00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he loves himself a conspiracy.</v>

873
00:35:50.221 --> 00:35:51.690
<v Speaker 3>He gets so excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

874
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:53.100
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like watching the clock in the</v>

875
00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:56.040
<v Speaker 3>community towards like a dude is super</v>
<v Speaker 3>into sports.</v>

876
00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:57.031
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he'll,</v>

877
00:35:57.031 --> 00:35:58.440
<v Speaker 3>he fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to talk to me about you?</v>

878
00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:02.980
<v Speaker 3>All I'm saying is it's a little weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

879
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.320
<v Speaker 3>you know what I tried to see someone was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

880
00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:05.760
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does he enjoy conspiracies?</v>

881
00:36:05.761 --> 00:36:06.420
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

882
00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:07.440
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy them.</v>

883
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:13.020
<v Speaker 3>Enjoy what you like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also Eddie's always been really good</v>

884
00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:18.290
<v Speaker 3>at like shutting down people not</v>
<v Speaker 3>believing in his ideas with Jujitsu is</v>

885
00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:25.800
<v Speaker 3>Eddie has like revolutionary Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu is rubber guard setups and all</v>

886
00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:28.260
<v Speaker 3>the different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The paths that he,</v>

887
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.680
<v Speaker 3>he fixed a lot of paths in traditional</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>

888
00:36:31.681 --> 00:36:33.990
<v Speaker 3>changed a lot of things and did some</v>
<v Speaker 3>things his way.</v>

889
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:35.790
<v Speaker 3>And when he would describe it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

890
00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:38.370
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a guy like has an idea how to do</v>

891
00:36:38.371 --> 00:36:41.210
<v Speaker 3>things and when people are opposing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

892
00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:41.581
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

893
00:36:41.581 --> 00:36:41.891
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

894
00:36:41.891 --> 00:36:43.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to shut that down and move</v>
<v Speaker 3>over here.</v>

895
00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:45.160
<v Speaker 3>So That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's brainworks hour.</v>

896
00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.670
<v Speaker 3>So when someone comes at him with an</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea,</v>

897
00:36:47.671 --> 00:36:50.760
<v Speaker 3>he has an idea and he's going to try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get that idea through.</v>

898
00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.690
<v Speaker 3>And when you come at him with some weak</v>
<v Speaker 3>attacks on that idea and just expect</v>

899
00:36:54.691 --> 00:36:57.030
<v Speaker 3>that he's going to relinquish his hold</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the idea,</v>

900
00:36:57.031 --> 00:36:57.420
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

901
00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:57.960
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no bitch.</v>

902
00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.010
<v Speaker 3>This don't make no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

903
00:36:59.011 --> 00:37:00.330
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have any information.</v>

904
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.770
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take someone giving him</v>
<v Speaker 3>real honest to goodness,</v>

905
00:37:04.771 --> 00:37:09.090
<v Speaker 3>impossible to deny information that he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to believe in any of the</v>

906
00:37:09.091 --> 00:37:11.760
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies that he believes in war</v>
<v Speaker 3>being false.</v>

907
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:16.790
<v Speaker 3>Or it's going to take somebody to</v>
<v Speaker 3>explain him that his feelings control</v>

908
00:37:17.041 --> 00:37:19.020
<v Speaker 3>his thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is true.</v>

909
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:24.200
<v Speaker 3>But there have been conspiracies that</v>
<v Speaker 3>have successfully been executed,</v>

910
00:37:24.241 --> 00:37:26.610
<v Speaker 3>which makes this whole thing way more</v>
<v Speaker 3>confusing.</v>

911
00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which one of these were real to say that</v>

912
00:37:29.251 --> 00:37:33.270
<v Speaker 3>all conspiracies are bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are a victim of like some reverse</v>

913
00:37:33.271 --> 00:37:34.104
<v Speaker 3>racism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

914
00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:35.040
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

915
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:37.770
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm usually skeptical of conspiracies,</v>

916
00:37:37.771 --> 00:37:42.180
<v Speaker 3>especially government conspiracies</v>
<v Speaker 3>because government has no tourists so</v>

917
00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:47.210
<v Speaker 3>completely out of sync and not efficient</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough and certainly there are so many</v>

918
00:37:48.301 --> 00:37:49.980
<v Speaker 3>different competing interests within</v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

919
00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:51.990
<v Speaker 3>Within an administration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

920
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:54.990
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's trying to undermine each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other and that's the history and it was</v>

921
00:37:54.991 --> 00:37:58.050
<v Speaker 3>set up that way and even if you talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about faking the moonlight,</v>

922
00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.430
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to have about a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 2000 people to keep a secret.</v>

923
00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:07.170
<v Speaker 3>That's not necessarily the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you just had people thinking on a</v>

924
00:38:07.171 --> 00:38:09.930
<v Speaker 3>need to know bates basis with everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>compartmentalized,</v>

925
00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:12.060
<v Speaker 3>like this guy's responsible for making</v>
<v Speaker 3>the o rings.</v>

926
00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.800
<v Speaker 3>This guy's responsible for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how it works.</v>

927
00:38:13.801 --> 00:38:15.330
<v Speaker 3>I've known,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how it works either,</v>

928
00:38:15.331 --> 00:38:18.270
<v Speaker 3>but I do know that you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were trying to fake the moon</v>

929
00:38:18.271 --> 00:38:19.890
<v Speaker 3>landing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that would be much</v>

930
00:38:19.891 --> 00:38:23.700
<v Speaker 3>easier is your d during the Nixon</v>
<v Speaker 3>administration there were getting used</v>

931
00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.440
<v Speaker 3>to fake and things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watergate was going on,</v>

932
00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>found out though,</v>

933
00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:28.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause somebody drops.</v>

934
00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:32.670
<v Speaker 3>You just starting to develop the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>special effects abilities where you can</v>

935
00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:37.730
<v Speaker 3>sort of recreate spacings like 2001 that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the big conspiracy theorist dream.</v>

936
00:38:38.471 --> 00:38:42.010
<v Speaker 3>Was that somehow or another like there'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>be like some irrefutable proof that</v>

937
00:38:42.011 --> 00:38:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Stanley Kubrick was the one who worked</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the moon landing.</v>

938
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.810
<v Speaker 3>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I'd found that I'd be like common in</v>

939
00:38:46.811 --> 00:38:49.990
<v Speaker 3>my pants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Eddie never acknowledges that the</v>

940
00:38:49.991 --> 00:38:54.730
<v Speaker 3>same impulse that drives him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is really to find the truth and to</v>

941
00:38:54.731 --> 00:38:59.731
<v Speaker 3>be skeptical of of people's claims and</v>
<v Speaker 3>even evidence that's been written down.</v>

942
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.420
<v Speaker 3>Human beings have always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always,</v>

943
00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:06.640
<v Speaker 3>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>unless there's something wrong with you</v>

944
00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:11.170
<v Speaker 3>want it to be in the know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anyone who doesn't want to</v>

945
00:39:11.171 --> 00:39:12.760
<v Speaker 3>know the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know anybody who doesn't want to</v>

946
00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:15.160
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who likes being deceived and so,</v>

947
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:19.540
<v Speaker 3>so it it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's almost impossible to</v>

948
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:23.590
<v Speaker 3>keep a secret longterm in government</v>
<v Speaker 3>because somebody's always talking on the</v>

949
00:39:23.591 --> 00:39:26.140
<v Speaker 3>other side of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's one of the reasons why the whole</v>

950
00:39:26.141 --> 00:39:31.141
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy thing is so attractive to</v>
<v Speaker 3>people because there's a reward chain</v>

951
00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.680
<v Speaker 3>built into the human psyche of solving a</v>
<v Speaker 3>problem that's presented in front of you</v>

952
00:39:35.681 --> 00:39:39.670
<v Speaker 3>that could potentially be dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a reward chain and deserves more</v>

953
00:39:39.671 --> 00:39:42.550
<v Speaker 3>chain gets acted upon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're talking about nonsense,</v>

954
00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:45.520
<v Speaker 3>even if this is like some area 51 you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

955
00:39:45.521 --> 00:39:50.320
<v Speaker 3>Ufo body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking whatever it is,</v>

956
00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Roswell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Mexico,</v>

957
00:39:51.881 --> 00:39:53.020
<v Speaker 3>the guy who was there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gut,</v>

958
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:54.430
<v Speaker 3>the general talk to my grandma.</v>

959
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:55.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He told me about the coffins,</v>

960
00:39:55.781 --> 00:39:58.420
<v Speaker 3>four foot tall coffin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were little alien babies.</v>

961
00:39:58.421 --> 00:40:00.960
<v Speaker 3>I took him to the back of the hearse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had embalmed and Mike.</v>

962
00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:02.890
<v Speaker 3>My aunt saw it and they killed her in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the forest.</v>

963
00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:05.080
<v Speaker 3>Like stop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

964
00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:07.990
<v Speaker 3>I know I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you have an explanation you</v>

965
00:40:07.991 --> 00:40:09.220
<v Speaker 3>don't feel as unsafe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

966
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:11.260
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I tell you that there are random</v>

967
00:40:11.261 --> 00:40:13.150
<v Speaker 3>things that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

968
00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:18.180
<v Speaker 3>the shooter in Las Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was 64 and there are no signs.</v>

969
00:40:18.371 --> 00:40:20.410
<v Speaker 3>He was very controlling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at these good bit of a</v>

970
00:40:20.411 --> 00:40:21.150
<v Speaker 3>sociopath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>

971
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.830
<v Speaker 3>we had this obsession with control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

972
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I just tell you that sometimes people</v>

973
00:40:26.411 --> 00:40:29.140
<v Speaker 3>wig the fuck out and they just want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot a bunch of people,</v>

974
00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:31.710
<v Speaker 3>that's not appropriate because then</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going to happen?</v>

975
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.220
<v Speaker 3>It's anxiety medication.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

976
00:40:33.221 --> 00:40:35.020
<v Speaker 3>But I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also like,</v>

977
00:40:35.021 --> 00:40:36.100
<v Speaker 3>when you say that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

978
00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:39.190
<v Speaker 3>now what you're saying is I have no real</v>
<v Speaker 3>way to protect myself.</v>

979
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.320
<v Speaker 3>Even if I carry a gun and take all my</v>
<v Speaker 3>vitamins,</v>

980
00:40:41.321 --> 00:40:44.170
<v Speaker 3>wear my seatbelt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always some crazy shit I didn't</v>

981
00:40:44.171 --> 00:40:45.310
<v Speaker 3>think about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called faith.</v>

982
00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:47.300
<v Speaker 3>The people I've talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

983
00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.000
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that understand,</v>

984
00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.280
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psych medicines that I've talked to,</v>

985
00:40:51.281 --> 00:40:53.170
<v Speaker 3>some psychiatrists I've had on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast,</v>

986
00:40:53.171 --> 00:40:55.480
<v Speaker 3>listen to Kelly Brogan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kelly Brogan talked about it quite</v>

987
00:40:55.481 --> 00:40:57.730
<v Speaker 3>extensively.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that she went,</v>

988
00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:02.200
<v Speaker 3>her and many other psychiatrists brought</v>
<v Speaker 3>up is the disassociative properties have</v>

989
00:41:02.201 --> 00:41:05.500
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these psych medicines that</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone might have a horrible idea in</v>

990
00:41:05.501 --> 00:41:07.690
<v Speaker 3>their head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the repercussions of it are real.</v>

991
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Like acting on it feels real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as soon as you have some sort of</v>

992
00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:14.500
<v Speaker 3>heavy disassociative psych medicine</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not even real,</v>

993
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.840
<v Speaker 3>like you don't care anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

994
00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:17.674
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

995
00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:19.750
<v Speaker 3>like watching yourself in a movie or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

996
00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.673
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

997
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:24.220
<v Speaker 3>you're Ron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something that Dole's all the highs and</v>

998
00:41:24.221 --> 00:41:25.054
<v Speaker 3>the lows.</v>

999
00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:27.760
<v Speaker 3>It puts you in this weird state where</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay,</v>

1000
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.100
<v Speaker 3>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's okay to just kill these people.</v>

1001
00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:32.980
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't know whether or not you</v>
<v Speaker 3>could,</v>

1002
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.440
<v Speaker 3>the leap from being a person who could</v>
<v Speaker 3>never kill somebody to be in a person</v>

1003
00:41:36.441 --> 00:41:37.820
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have a problem with killing</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>

1004
00:41:37.821 --> 00:41:39.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1005
00:41:39.141 --> 00:41:40.580
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a Chaz.</v>

1006
00:41:40.581 --> 00:41:44.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm too far to cross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I guarantee you if you're the type</v>

1007
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:49.181
<v Speaker 3>of person that is having some horrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>thoughts about like being aggressive to</v>

1008
00:41:50.601 --> 00:41:53.750
<v Speaker 3>people and then someone puts you on</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that makes you like,</v>

1009
00:41:53.751 --> 00:41:56.180
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's gonna.</v>

1010
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:57.420
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you are Ha,</v>

1011
00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.380
<v Speaker 3>who knows what the right chemical is</v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

1012
00:42:00.381 --> 00:42:02.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if they give you the wrong one,</v>

1013
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:05.360
<v Speaker 3>maybe it'll switch you one way or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right one.</v>

1014
00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:08.070
<v Speaker 3>We'll turn the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe we should add some abilify into</v>

1015
00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:08.933
<v Speaker 3>the mix.</v>

1016
00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:13.100
<v Speaker 3>Just throw some of this in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an antipsychotic to help you all</v>

1017
00:42:13.101 --> 00:42:15.050
<v Speaker 3>even out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know you can have a lesion on</v>

1018
00:42:15.051 --> 00:42:17.230
<v Speaker 3>your brain?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The size of the head of a pen.</v>

1019
00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:19.010
<v Speaker 3>You can have a lesion and if it's in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1020
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:23.300
<v Speaker 3>there's a specific area of the brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it can be a tiny lesion that you</v>

1021
00:42:23.301 --> 00:42:27.500
<v Speaker 3>can't see really barely with the naked</v>
<v Speaker 3>eye and it can render you a homicidal</v>

1022
00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:30.200
<v Speaker 3>maniac.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't my problem fighting off the</v>

1023
00:42:30.201 --> 00:42:32.180
<v Speaker 3>leash?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got lesions in my brain.</v>

1024
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:33.470
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1025
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.600
<v Speaker 3>What is it called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the leaves?</v>

1026
00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:36.020
<v Speaker 3>Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could look it up for you,</v>

1027
00:42:36.021 --> 00:42:39.350
<v Speaker 3>but it's by eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you can use where I heard it was in</v>

1028
00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:44.351
<v Speaker 3>a lecture by Daniel Robinson who is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>professor at Oxford and Georgetown and</v>

1029
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:48.560
<v Speaker 3>the smartest man on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you have to really be careful</v>

1030
00:42:48.561 --> 00:42:50.210
<v Speaker 3>when you're punching people in the head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1031
00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes sir.</v>

1032
00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.660
<v Speaker 3>That's why it causes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1033
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:56.090
<v Speaker 3>so the guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who does that make sense?</v>

1034
00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.870
<v Speaker 3>Neuroscience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who captured the 13 year old girl?</v>

1035
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:00.740
<v Speaker 3>Not Elizabeth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>SMART,</v>

1036
00:43:00.741 --> 00:43:02.660
<v Speaker 3>but the other one had two children with</v>
<v Speaker 3>her,</v>

1037
00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.910
<v Speaker 3>kept her for 18 years and she escaped.</v>

<v Speaker 3>until,</v>

1044
00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean literally she was 18 then they</v>
<v Speaker 3>would go out once in a while.</v>

1045
00:43:19.911 --> 00:43:22.240
<v Speaker 3>It was real Stockholm Syndrome shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1046
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:22.881
<v Speaker 3>Then she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1050
00:43:26.631 --> 00:43:28.580
<v Speaker 3>just a terrible story I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you about earlier.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Is it Libya or is it Iraq?</v>

1053
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:37.670
<v Speaker 3>It's Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>

1054
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:39.440
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's in Iraq too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1055
00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:42.020
<v Speaker 3>But it was Libya and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1056
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:46.850
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget who the title it was usa today</v>

1057
00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:51.290

<v Speaker 3>thanks Hilary Clinton because Hilary</v>

1058
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:53.600
<v Speaker 3>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently they're blaming her decisions</v>

1059
00:43:53.601 --> 00:43:57.980
<v Speaker 3>on the reason why we went into Libya and</v>
<v Speaker 3>dethrone Mo Market Aafia who knows?</v>

1060
00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:59.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would know maybe more than most,</v>

1061
00:43:59.841 --> 00:44:03.980
<v Speaker 3>but video of migrants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>soul and apparent slave auction in Libya</v>

1062
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:06.420
<v Speaker 3>provokes outrage worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's disturbing,</v>

1063
00:44:06.421 --> 00:44:07.550
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you watch it,</v>

1064

<v Speaker 3>they got guns to these dudes heads those</v>
<v Speaker 3>photos.</v>

1065
00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.720
<v Speaker 3>I retweeted it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to go to my instagram,</v>

1066
00:44:11.721 --> 00:44:16.610
<v Speaker 3>you can see some of the pictures of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they have like Libya is a failed</v>

1067
00:44:16.611 --> 00:44:17.840
<v Speaker 3>state now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1068
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:21.360
<v Speaker 3>And it's God damn terrifying in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1069
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.080
<v Speaker 3>2017.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at that in,</v>

1070
00:44:24.081 --> 00:44:27.790
<v Speaker 3>in 1970 and my father just told a story</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

1071
00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:31.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at Thanksgiving and he was talking how</v>

1072
00:44:31.561 --> 00:44:32.394
<v Speaker 3>Dubai</v>

1073
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:35.880
<v Speaker 4>and Abu Dhabi have become these</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible countries.</v>

1074
00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.750
<v Speaker 4>And when he was first there in 1970 and</v>
<v Speaker 4>1971,</v>

1075
00:44:39.751 --> 00:44:41.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1076
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.770
<v Speaker 4>somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see that woman over there and she</v>

1077
00:44:43.771 --> 00:44:47.610
<v Speaker 4>was a black woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was from Africa somewhere and uh,</v>

1078
00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:48.830
<v Speaker 4>I supply,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said yes,</v>

1079
00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:49.950
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a slave.</v>

1080
00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:53.250
<v Speaker 4>And that was in Dubai,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe back in the day.</v>

1081
00:44:53.251 --> 00:44:56.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry to anybody from Dubai.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you guys have come a very long</v>

1082
00:44:56.821 --> 00:44:58.020
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but slavery was the,</v>

1083
00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.510
<v Speaker 4>was order of the day for in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>countries.</v>

1084
00:45:00.511 --> 00:45:03.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm not just picking on you in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>countries and a lot of countries,</v>

1085
00:45:03.571 --> 00:45:04.800
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the order of the day.</v>

1086
00:45:04.801 --> 00:45:06.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean the idea that slavery would no</v>
<v Speaker 4>longer be a case.</v>

1087
00:45:06.961 --> 00:45:09.030
<v Speaker 4>The idea that this would be outrageous</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the world,</v>

1088
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:14.510
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in 1940 would be certainly in 1910 or</v>

1089
00:45:14.761 --> 00:45:16.290
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would have been like what now it will</v>

1090
00:45:16.291 --> 00:45:16.830
<v Speaker 4>always go on.</v>

1091
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:17.760
<v Speaker 4>Slavery's is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1092
00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.350
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is in order,</v>

1093
00:45:19.351 --> 00:45:20.490
<v Speaker 4>is the way of life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1094
00:45:20.491 --> 00:45:22.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think though today with the ability to</v>

1095
00:45:22.861 --> 00:45:27.861
<v Speaker 4>film slave auctions when your cell phone</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then stream that shit I [inaudible]</v>

1096
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:31.380
<v Speaker 4>dot com or whatever this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more you learn about people and how,</v>

1097
00:45:31.381 --> 00:45:33.990
<v Speaker 4>how similar we all are and how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1098
00:45:33.991 --> 00:45:36.540
<v Speaker 4>Sam Harris had a really interesting ted</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about this,</v>

1099
00:45:36.541 --> 00:45:40.050
<v Speaker 4>about the idea that you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to be able to have a</v>

1100
00:45:40.051 --> 00:45:45.051
<v Speaker 4>conversation about what is the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>optimal way to live for a human being.</v>

1101
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:48.360
<v Speaker 4>What is the most optimal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it,</v>

1102
00:45:48.361 --> 00:45:53.361
<v Speaker 4>is it true that women are at their best</v>
<v Speaker 4>when having to wear a full Burka in 120</v>

1103
00:45:54.121 --> 00:45:55.800
<v Speaker 4>degree heat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

1104
00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:56.760
<v Speaker 4>Is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

1105
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.700
<v Speaker 4>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are all opinions are welcome at the</v>

1106
00:45:59.701 --> 00:46:01.650
<v Speaker 4>table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you interested,</v>

1107
00:46:01.651 --> 00:46:04.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm quoting Sam here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but are you interested in the Taliban's</v>

1108
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:05.850
<v Speaker 4>point of view on physics?</v>

1109
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.400
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1110
00:46:07.401 --> 00:46:09.420
<v Speaker 4>and does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's someone who does,</v>

1111
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:14.400
<v Speaker 4>does for that matter and he talks about</v>
<v Speaker 4>himself is his point of view on string</v>

1112
00:46:14.401 --> 00:46:16.020
<v Speaker 4>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which he knows nothing about.</v>

1113
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.580
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as valid as somebody who studies string</v>

1114
00:46:18.581 --> 00:46:19.220
<v Speaker 4>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1115
00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:20.550
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we get it.</v>

1116
00:46:20.551 --> 00:46:22.470
<v Speaker 4>There's a tendency to kind of go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1117
00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's your culture and I'm not going to</v>

1118
00:46:24.901 --> 00:46:27.840
<v Speaker 4>get involved in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though it's might seem brutal by my</v>

1119
00:46:27.841 --> 00:46:30.180
<v Speaker 4>standards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You hear this a lot with like the aztecs</v>

1120
00:46:30.181 --> 00:46:32.760
<v Speaker 4>and human sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's very taboo to talk about how it</v>

1121
00:46:32.761 --> 00:46:33.810
<v Speaker 4>was Barbara,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause you know,</v>

1122
00:46:33.811 --> 00:46:36.900
<v Speaker 4>that was them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You and me and Steven Rinella had a</v>

1123
00:46:36.901 --> 00:46:39.600
<v Speaker 4>conversation about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rinella literally didn't believe me when</v>

1124
00:46:39.601 --> 00:46:42.600
<v Speaker 4>I told them they sacrificed 80,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it?</v>

1125
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:45.210
<v Speaker 4>Is that the number was a number when</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd sacrificed the,</v>

1126
00:46:45.211 --> 00:46:46.290
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1127
00:46:46.291 --> 00:46:48.850
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who are not a huge sign of</v>

1128
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:50.920
<v Speaker 4>ICAN,</v>
<v Speaker 4>temple of [inaudible].</v>

1129
00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:52.830
<v Speaker 4>Is that how you say it too?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alcon,</v>

1130
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:56.580
<v Speaker 4>but apparently they'd sacrificed some</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking insane number of slaves.</v>

1131
00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:59.620
<v Speaker 4>So it's so crazy that if you tell a</v>
<v Speaker 4>rational personally,</v>

1132
00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:00.481
<v Speaker 4>Steve Rinelli,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

1133
00:47:00.481 --> 00:47:04.530
<v Speaker 4>why I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't be true until you go and read</v>

1134
00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:05.380
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he'd go,</v>

1135
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:08.700
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how horrible where people then,</v>

1136
00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:09.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they could sacrifice.</v>

1137
00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:13.110
<v Speaker 4>I really want to say it was 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>people then.</v>

1138
00:47:13.170 --> 00:47:14.580
<v Speaker 4>That was the number,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the numbers,</v>

1139
00:47:14.581 --> 00:47:15.271
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1140
00:47:15.271 --> 00:47:17.340
<v Speaker 4>that's a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like in a couple of days,</v>

1141
00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.800
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the people that worked on the temple</v>

1142
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.260
<v Speaker 4>apparently after it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just sacrificed them.</v>

1143
00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.940
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1144
00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:25.140
<v Speaker 4>Just a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The aztecs,</v>

1145
00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:26.820
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things they say is Cortez to</v>

1146
00:47:26.821 --> 00:47:30.280
<v Speaker 4>able to conquer the aztecs much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>easily over a lot more easily because</v>

1147
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:34.060
<v Speaker 3>the aztecs had neighbors that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>hated them because they aspects would go</v>

1148
00:47:34.061 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 3>in and basically if you weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1149
00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:40.120
<v Speaker 3>an Aztec,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means you a person of the son,</v>

1150
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:43.570
<v Speaker 3>you'd get sacrificed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So their neighbors were like,</v>

1151

<v Speaker 3>There was this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's this like thing,</v>

1159
00:47:59.171 --> 00:48:02.050
<v Speaker 3>it's like a demon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's lying on its back.</v>

1160
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:06.370
<v Speaker 3>And they would sacrifice the people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stomach area where they sacrificed</v>

1161
00:48:06.371 --> 00:48:08.560
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of grooved out from all the</v>

<v Speaker 3>bodies had been slicing on it day on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1163
00:48:12.881 --> 00:48:13.810
<v Speaker 3>that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why,</v>

1164
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:15.730
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm wrong.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's way more is high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's estimates.</v>

1166
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:22.120
<v Speaker 3>The number of persons sacrifice and</v>
<v Speaker 3>central Mexico in the 15th century was</v>

1167
00:48:22.121 --> 00:48:26.740
<v Speaker 3>as high as 250,000 per year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>don't know how to say this.</v>

1169
00:48:31.551 --> 00:48:33.280
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I contentious number by the way.</v>

1170
00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:34.121
<v Speaker 3>Of course it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people,</v>

1171
00:48:34.121 --> 00:48:36.060
<v Speaker 3>like people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people were like bullshit.</v>

1172
00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:37.520
<v Speaker 3>And there's a lot of historians that had</v>
<v Speaker 3>did the,</v>

1173
00:48:37.610 --> 00:48:38.530
<v Speaker 3>and publishing my book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>

00:48:38.531 --> 00:48:41.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm jacking it up 100,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was,</v>

1175
00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:43.480
<v Speaker 3>if I was a a historian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1176
00:48:43.481 --> 00:48:47.170
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 million people died on the shores.</v>

1177
00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:49.780
<v Speaker 3>Although the whole male population was</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to be warriors.</v>

1178
00:48:49.781 --> 00:48:50.140
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1179
00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:51.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the,</v>

1180
00:48:51.461 --> 00:48:56.461
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>c just google 80,000 aztecs sacrificed</v>

1181
00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.730
<v Speaker 3>temple of tea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to say the word icon to</v>

1182

<v Speaker 3>a con.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget out.</v>

1183
00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.140
<v Speaker 3>How'd he say it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I believe what they did was they</v>

1184
00:49:05.141 --> 00:49:09.370
<v Speaker 3>built this fucking spectacular struck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spectacular structure and then killed</v>

1185
00:49:09.371 --> 00:49:10.390
<v Speaker 3>everybody worked on it.</v>

1186
00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:14.170
<v Speaker 3>They just killed the union.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kind of like El Chapo when you'd build a</v>

1187
00:49:14.171 --> 00:49:15.850
<v Speaker 3>tunnel for him and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can know where it is.</v>

1188
00:49:15.851 --> 00:49:16.331
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could,</v>

1189
00:49:16.331 --> 00:49:20.200
<v Speaker 3>could you talk apparently to have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>party for him and then you guys,</v>

1190
00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:24.550
<v Speaker 3>thanks for working on the tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a party to toast champagne and</v>

1191
00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:26.380
<v Speaker 3>here's some lead poisoning as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super,</v>

1192
00:49:26.381 --> 00:49:29.320
<v Speaker 3>super hammered when hookers and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoot him in the head while they're</v>

1193
00:49:29.321 --> 00:49:33.310
<v Speaker 3>sleeping and can't have people know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said that the Soviets would do</v>

1194
00:49:33.311 --> 00:49:33.981
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when,</v>

1195
00:49:33.981 --> 00:49:37.480
<v Speaker 3>when you would build a tunnel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you ever hear that story about how</v>

1196
00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.590
<v Speaker 3>we figured out that implementer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does this,</v>

1197
00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:44.770
<v Speaker 3>this is it I say that will make that</v>
<v Speaker 3>larger please.</v>

1198
00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:47.280
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiene no tiene,</v>

1199
00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:50.830
<v Speaker 3>no Chit [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

1200
00:49:51.550 --> 00:49:53.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's the same one.</v>

1201
00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:57.550
<v Speaker 3>I 80,000 came up with it because that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number of people.</v>

1202
00:49:57.850 --> 00:49:59.830
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I've seen it said,</v>

1203
00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:01.630
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think also when one of the things you</v>

1204
00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:03.260
<v Speaker 3>have to deal with when you're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a,</v>

1205
00:50:03.261 --> 00:50:08.261
<v Speaker 3>an English deciphering of really ancient</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aztec and Mayan code is that it's</v>

1206
00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:12.610
<v Speaker 3>phonetic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like there's sounds that they made</v>

1207
00:50:12.611 --> 00:50:14.740
<v Speaker 3>that they're trying to replicate with</v>
<v Speaker 3>English words,</v>

1208
00:50:14.741 --> 00:50:17.110
<v Speaker 3>but they weren't really designed for</v>
<v Speaker 3>English lettering,</v>

1209
00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:18.453
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1210
00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.020
<v Speaker 3>they're designed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're hieroglyphs,</v>

1211
00:50:20.021 --> 00:50:21.390
<v Speaker 3>they have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1212
00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.230
<v Speaker 3>the way they wrote and spoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

1213
00:50:23.231 --> 00:50:25.600
<v Speaker 3>very different than the way we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1214
00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:26.970
<v Speaker 3>they had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1215
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.860
<v Speaker 7>like some of the Mayan writing in</v>
<v Speaker 7>particular.</v>

1216
00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:32.030
<v Speaker 7>What does it say there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jamie?</v>

1217
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:34.920
<v Speaker 7>He troward thousands of,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

1218
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:36.440
<v Speaker 7>some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the um,</v>

1219
00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:39.980
<v Speaker 7>God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some of the Mayan languages were like</v>

1220
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:42.560
<v Speaker 7>images that like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like the tenants,</v>

1221
00:50:42.561 --> 00:50:44.870
<v Speaker 7>we kind of described it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was like,</v>

1222
00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:48.770
<v Speaker 7>you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like an eyeball and a picture and then</v>

1223
00:50:48.771 --> 00:50:51.440
<v Speaker 7>you'd have a saw and you'd have a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the bug,</v>

1224
00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:52.610
<v Speaker 7>the ant,</v>
<v Speaker 7>an ant,</v>

1225
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:54.650
<v Speaker 7>and then you'd have the flower,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the rose.</v>

1226
00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:56.960
<v Speaker 7>And that's how you would say I saw aunt</v>
<v Speaker 7>rose.</v>

1227
00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:58.770
<v Speaker 7>That's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1228
00:50:59.050 --> 00:50:59.780
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

1229
00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:03.740
<v Speaker 7>Because we just assume that everyone</v>
<v Speaker 7>should,</v>

1230
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:05.720
<v Speaker 7>what is like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is writing?</v>

1231
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:10.550
<v Speaker 7>Writing is some symbols that you make</v>
<v Speaker 7>that correspond to certain sounds that</v>

1232
00:51:10.551 --> 00:51:15.140
<v Speaker 7>we've all agreed in our own personal</v>
<v Speaker 7>definitions that we have.</v>

1233
00:51:15.141 --> 00:51:18.800
<v Speaker 7>And in societies,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've all agreed that this sound means a</v>

1234
00:51:18.801 --> 00:51:21.290
<v Speaker 7>certain thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We argue the parameters of what that</v>

1235
00:51:21.291 --> 00:51:22.280
<v Speaker 7>means.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1236
00:51:22.281 --> 00:51:24.740
<v Speaker 7>And that's why people get super offended</v>
<v Speaker 7>when someone says it like,</v>

1237
00:51:24.741 --> 00:51:27.260
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like words are violence.</v>

1238
00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:28.090
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

1239
00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:29.510
<v Speaker 7>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're fucking with the real.</v>

1240
00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:32.210
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't know if violence and never been</v>

1241
00:51:32.211 --> 00:51:35.900
<v Speaker 4>punched in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You haven't seen somebody like get sold</v>

1242
00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:38.660
<v Speaker 4>by all the silos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Say it's so important for young people</v>

1243
00:51:38.661 --> 00:51:40.880
<v Speaker 4>to understand that the difference</v>
<v Speaker 4>between things and,</v>

1244
00:51:40.881 --> 00:51:45.410
<v Speaker 4>and there's a real tendency to equate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>equate.</v>

1245
00:51:45.411 --> 00:51:49.340
<v Speaker 4>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wrote a memo at Google and it made</v>

1246
00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.040
<v Speaker 4>an unsafe work environment for women and</v>
<v Speaker 4>your healer.</v>

1247
00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:53.390
<v Speaker 4>Now you're Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hitler.</v>

1248
00:51:53.391 --> 00:51:54.530
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1249
00:51:54.531 --> 00:51:57.230
<v Speaker 4>crab boats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coal mines and Navy Seals,</v>

1250
00:51:57.231 --> 00:51:59.930
<v Speaker 4>they have a pretty dangerous work</v>
<v Speaker 4>environment as well.</v>

1251
00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:01.040
<v Speaker 4>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

1252
00:52:01.041 --> 00:52:03.920
<v Speaker 4>let's talk about the fucking difference</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's very,</v>

1253
00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:05.270
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1254
00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:08.300
<v Speaker 4>it gets very weird and dangerous and</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaningless.</v>

1255
00:52:08.301 --> 00:52:09.950
<v Speaker 4>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

1256
00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:14.030
<v Speaker 4>when you equate everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you basically say,</v>

1257
00:52:14.031 --> 00:52:14.691
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1258
00:52:14.691 --> 00:52:17.690
<v Speaker 4>you shouted at me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's assault versus breaking my nose.</v>

1259
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.880
<v Speaker 4>And we have lots of different examples</v>
<v Speaker 4>of that.</v>

1260
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:22.340
<v Speaker 4>It does a disservice to people that have</v>
<v Speaker 4>suffered real,</v>

1261
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.611
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>violence.</v>

1262
00:52:23.611 --> 00:52:26.280
<v Speaker 7>You know what I think is going on man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I could sum it up in Warren word</v>

1263
00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:30.720
<v Speaker 7>tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a natural inclination that we</v>

1264
00:52:30.721 --> 00:52:35.070
<v Speaker 7>have to form likeminded groups and</v>
<v Speaker 7>defend our position to the death.</v>

1265
00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:38.780
<v Speaker 7>And this is what people are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's not that you're wrong,</v>

1266
00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:42.420
<v Speaker 7>he's right or he's right or wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's that all of us are acting like</v>

1267
00:52:42.421 --> 00:52:44.610
<v Speaker 7>people trying to protect our team.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's right.</v>

1268
00:52:44.611 --> 00:52:47.280
<v Speaker 7>And that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's an incorrect way of behaving.</v>

1269
00:52:47.281 --> 00:52:49.140
<v Speaker 7>So if you say that like words are</v>
<v Speaker 7>violence,</v>

1270
00:52:49.141 --> 00:52:49.974
<v Speaker 7>like guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And</v>

1271
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:51.060
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not.</v>

1272
00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:52.830
<v Speaker 4>Go Fuck yourself too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that violent?</v>

1273
00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:55.070
<v Speaker 4>This is what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about this in my standup,</v>

1274
00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:55.621
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1275
00:52:55.621 --> 00:52:59.150
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's much easier to be full against</v>

1276
00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:00.700
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really easy to be against that.</v>

1277
00:53:00.701 --> 00:53:02.760
<v Speaker 4>We joined a team.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens is you don't have to do the</v>

1278
00:53:02.761 --> 00:53:03.594
<v Speaker 4>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He let the,</v>

1279
00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:06.030
<v Speaker 4>let the leader do all the thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got the bullet points.</v>

1280
00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:09.030
<v Speaker 4>Now what your job as a soldier is to put</v>
<v Speaker 4>down the other team.</v>

1281
00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:12.000
<v Speaker 4>It's much more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And think about this for young people</v>

1282
00:53:12.001 --> 00:53:13.950
<v Speaker 4>listening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's way harder to define what your,</v>

1283
00:53:13.951 --> 00:53:17.460
<v Speaker 4>for defining what you're actually for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like so if you're a revolutionary,</v>

1284
00:53:17.461 --> 00:53:19.950
<v Speaker 4>you want to burn down the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole,</v>

1285
00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:23.010
<v Speaker 4>you know the whole house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to replace it with</v>

1286
00:53:23.011 --> 00:53:24.670
<v Speaker 4>men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's really important and</v>

1287
00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 4>revolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did</v>

1288
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.350
<v Speaker 3>with Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Revolutionaries.</v>

1289
00:53:27.351 --> 00:53:30.720
<v Speaker 3>Forget that shit all the time about like</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they came,</v>

1290
00:53:30.721 --> 00:53:33.020
<v Speaker 3>they saw and he died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1291
00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:34.080
<v Speaker 3>You've got really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad guy.</v>

1292
00:53:34.081 --> 00:53:34.861
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now what?</v>

1293
00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you replacing it with?</v>

1294
00:53:35.941 --> 00:53:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well welcome to the power of vacuum.</v>

1295
00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:40.890
<v Speaker 3>You hope you're going to be dead before</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking becomes a disaster and a</v>

1296
00:53:40.891 --> 00:53:42.420
<v Speaker 3>failed state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you're not.</v>

1297
00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:45.330
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my problem when when people,</v>

1298
00:53:45.331 --> 00:53:48.090
<v Speaker 3>and we have a lot of people in our</v>
<v Speaker 3>government that look at a problem and</v>

1299
00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:48.960
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1300
00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:51.840
<v Speaker 3>it's isis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we need to do is get authorization</v>

1301
00:53:51.841 --> 00:53:54.480
<v Speaker 3>to kill more of them in other places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you're talking about is groups</v>

1302
00:53:54.481 --> 00:53:56.790
<v Speaker 3>that identify as isis and that's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to solve the problem.</v>

1303
00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:00.210
<v Speaker 3>My problem with that typically is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes back to that,</v>

1304
00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:02.520
<v Speaker 3>one of my favorite sayings is it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you think.</v>

1305
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.950
<v Speaker 3>What you think is way less important</v>
<v Speaker 3>than how you think.</v>

1306
00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:07.890
<v Speaker 3>Because a lot of times if you pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>attention to your thinking exactly the</v>

1307
00:54:07.891 --> 00:54:11.220
<v Speaker 3>way your enemies snaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not so sure that that's how you do</v>

1308
00:54:11.221 --> 00:54:13.110
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not so sure that bombing and</v>

1309
00:54:13.111 --> 00:54:15.270
<v Speaker 3>shooting your way out of that problem is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way to go.</v>

1310
00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:18.480
<v Speaker 3>It might be in some cases I think you</v>
<v Speaker 3>need seal team six,</v>

1311
00:54:18.481 --> 00:54:22.860
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera for certain shitheads but we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't see the Line of defense.</v>

1312
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:24.720
<v Speaker 3>Everyone has to know that they're real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1313
00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:27.480
<v Speaker 3>That's like one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 3>things about the elite forces of the</v>

1314
00:54:27.481 --> 00:54:30.030
<v Speaker 3>government or of our military.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said people need to know the real.</v>

1315
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:34.770
<v Speaker 3>You need to know that's real cause like</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 100,000 whatever the fuck.</v>

1316
00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:37.920
<v Speaker 3>There are people right now that are just</v>
<v Speaker 3>ready to go.</v>

1317
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:39.930
<v Speaker 3>All you have to do is press a button</v>
<v Speaker 3>launch.</v>

1318
00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:42.390
<v Speaker 3>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank God for Tim Kennedy,</v>

1319
00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:43.890
<v Speaker 3>etc. Exactly.</v>

1320
00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:46.590
<v Speaker 3>Cause remember this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need walls,</v>

1321
00:54:46.591 --> 00:54:49.680
<v Speaker 3>you need strong walls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those walls.</v>

1322
00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:51.600
<v Speaker 3>You haven't seen enough bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1323
00:54:51.601 --> 00:54:53.670
<v Speaker 3>You don't cause there aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mongols are out there.</v>

1324
00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.533
<v Speaker 3>They're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1325
00:54:54.600 --> 00:54:55.530
<v Speaker 3>Look at Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1326
00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:56.580
<v Speaker 3>you're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1327
00:54:56.581 --> 00:54:57.930
<v Speaker 3>And these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1328
00:54:57.931 --> 00:55:00.090
<v Speaker 3>that are in the military that the only</v>
<v Speaker 3>ones that are experiencing it,</v>

1329
00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.620
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're back here.</v>

1330
00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:04.680
<v Speaker 3>You're passing judgment on there saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1331
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:06.540
<v Speaker 3>there's zombies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1332
00:55:06.541 --> 00:55:08.250
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll let the fucking world's gone</v>

1333
00:55:08.251 --> 00:55:09.240
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1334
00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:12.990
<v Speaker 3>they're selling slaves in the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like we need to all know that there are</v>

1335
00:55:12.991 --> 00:55:15.870
<v Speaker 3>people that are in some really horrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>parts of the world right now that can</v>

1336
00:55:15.871 --> 00:55:18.330
<v Speaker 3>give you valuable information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean we should kill those</v>

1337
00:55:18.331 --> 00:55:20.190
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean we should fucking nation</v>

1338
00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:23.460
<v Speaker 3>build.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we need to be aware of the landscape</v>

1339
00:55:23.850 --> 00:55:25.890
<v Speaker 3>and keep this in mind though too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it's not.</v>

1340
00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:29.550
<v Speaker 3>That would be hard strength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need men like,</v>

1341
00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:30.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tim Kennedy,</v>

1342
00:55:30.991 --> 00:55:32.040
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys who are,</v>

1343
00:55:32.041 --> 00:55:34.500
<v Speaker 3>who are our protectors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who we can push a button go,</v>

1344
00:55:34.501 --> 00:55:36.930
<v Speaker 3>hey those fucking guys want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there are people out there that want</v>

1345
00:55:36.931 --> 00:55:40.020
<v Speaker 3>to kill us for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I always think that it's also</v>

1346
00:55:40.021 --> 00:55:44.610
<v Speaker 3>important to remember that those guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>are doing that to protect the softer</v>

1347
00:55:44.611 --> 00:55:46.890
<v Speaker 3>strengths in our community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that are creative,</v>

1348
00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:50.070
<v Speaker 3>people that are inventing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't have a doctor working on a</v>

1349
00:55:50.071 --> 00:55:53.100
<v Speaker 3>cure for cancer and had the Mongols come</v>
<v Speaker 3>over and smash all his fucking beakers.</v>

1350
00:55:53.101 --> 00:55:54.810
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why you need those.</v>

1351
00:55:54.811 --> 00:55:57.390
<v Speaker 3>So you need both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Problem is you knew you do need both.</v>

1352
00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:00.590
<v Speaker 3>And the people on one side don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>recognize the people and the other side</v>

1353
00:56:00.591 --> 00:56:02.250
<v Speaker 3>cause they wished they didn't have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>exist.</v>

1354
00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Exactly what they do have to exist.</v>

1355
00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Of course they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a balance to this fucking thing.</v>

1356
00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:07.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here's the thing,</v>

1357
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:11.280
<v Speaker 3>people in Libya,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if Kevin Spacey had a TV show in Libya,</v>

1358
00:56:11.281 --> 00:56:14.700
<v Speaker 3>we fucked all the grips right in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth before every episode they would</v>

1359
00:56:14.701 --> 00:56:15.534
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he does.</v>

1360
00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:18.590
<v Speaker 3>He's the fucking store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would just talk with this stuff.</v>

1361
00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:23.700
<v Speaker 3>Kevin's business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

<v Speaker 3>your mouth open.</v>

<v Speaker 3>fucking dead dog on the side of the</v>

1364

<v Speaker 3>road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kick them over.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You lose your leg?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1366

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>What's the appointment?</v>

1368

<v Speaker 3>what do you want to do?</v>

1371
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:50.320
<v Speaker 3>What you went to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you went to live that isn't offensive.</v>

1372
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.840
<v Speaker 3>Accents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>personable.</v>

1373
00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:57.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know why you do it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't sound like anyone that's ever</v>

1374
00:56:57.731 --> 00:56:59.470
<v Speaker 3>lived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so offensive.</v>

1375
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.600
<v Speaker 3>No ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a bad accent.</v>

1376
00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:04.360
<v Speaker 3>It's exactly what someone who doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know how to speak English with Sally.</v>

1377
00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:09.070
<v Speaker 3>I would wish that I could speak Arabic</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I could realize how fucking shitty my</v>

1378
00:57:09.071 --> 00:57:13.420
<v Speaker 3>fee bad Arabic would be if I learned</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arabic for a couple of years and tried</v>

1379
00:57:13.421 --> 00:57:16.540
<v Speaker 3>to talk to those people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make Fun of me.</v>

1380
00:57:16.541 --> 00:57:19.360
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I give you full permission to make fun</v>

1381
00:57:19.361 --> 00:57:22.540
<v Speaker 3>of an American pretending to be or</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to speak Arabic.</v>

1382
00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:24.850
<v Speaker 3>Arabic is a very difficult language to</v>
<v Speaker 3>learn.</v>

1383
00:57:24.851 --> 00:57:27.880
<v Speaker 3>Too hard for me to hide my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend.</v>

1384
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:30.580
<v Speaker 3>It's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a rich language compared to</v>

1385
00:57:30.581 --> 00:57:33.700
<v Speaker 3>like French Haley.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give Kevin Spacey a race if he was in</v>

1386
00:57:33.701 --> 00:57:35.110
<v Speaker 3>Libya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had a show in Livia,</v>

1387
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:37.240
<v Speaker 3>Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Libya would give them a raise</v>

1388
00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.320
<v Speaker 3>would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is method duct.</v>

1389
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.200
<v Speaker 3>This is our president would do fuck them</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of everyone.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

1391
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:49.990
<v Speaker 3>This is what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How you are behaving as a president all</v>

1392
00:57:49.991 --> 00:57:53.350
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go Frank Underwood is a fucking grade.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Shoot through the fucking ceiling just</v>

1394
00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:01.570
<v Speaker 3>in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kiss him on the mouth and Lee's not a</v>

<v Speaker 3>Who's a pervert.</v>

1397
00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:07.810
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what you'd do.</v>

1398
00:58:07.811 --> 00:58:11.880
<v Speaker 3>You'll fuck every once a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have the president will have to</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's nothing I can do it.</v>

1400
00:58:12.821 --> 00:58:16.900
<v Speaker 3>They just get drunk as fuck on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on booze made out of camel pice.</v>

1401
00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:20.650
<v Speaker 3>I take camel piss and they mixed wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hear about how the president of the</v>

1402
00:58:20.651 --> 00:58:24.220
<v Speaker 3>longtime dictator of Yemen got power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a major in the army.</v>

1403
00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:25.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared.</v>

1404
00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:27.370
<v Speaker 3>He just showed up at uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he was there.</v>

1405
00:58:27.370 --> 00:58:29.290
<v Speaker 3>He was just going to be one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>majors.</v>

1406
00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:33.520
<v Speaker 3>And the president was having a cabinet</v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting and apparently you can look this</v>

1407
00:58:33.521 --> 00:58:34.270
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

1408
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:38.950
<v Speaker 3>Apparently he basically put a briefcase</v>
<v Speaker 3>down or a suitcase down and just pull</v>

1409
00:58:38.951 --> 00:58:41.380
<v Speaker 3>out two guns and went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well cln or Kush,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Kush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kush,</v>

1411
00:58:41.771 --> 00:58:42.400
<v Speaker 3>Kush,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kush,</v>

<v Speaker 3>The entire decapitated.</v>

1413
00:58:44.981 --> 00:58:46.540
<v Speaker 3>The government goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in charge now.</v>

1414
00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:48.770
<v Speaker 3>Uh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh Huh.</v>

1415

<v Speaker 3>Uh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you was it.</v>

1416
00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:55.200
<v Speaker 3>It's in the 70s you ever see what a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pistol Grip Uzi looks like?</v>

1417
00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:59.410
<v Speaker 3>See you later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he rolled the nation with</v>

1418
00:58:59.411 --> 00:59:01.780
<v Speaker 3>what's called an iron fist for about 30</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1419
00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:03.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you watched Narcos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1420
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.910
<v Speaker 3>I certainly have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about that fucking show?</v>

1421
00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:09.190
<v Speaker 3>How about Pablo Escobar?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

1422
00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:14.020
<v Speaker 3>You know what's crazy is apparently</v>
<v Speaker 3>Columbia's bounced back tremendously and</v>

1423
00:59:14.021 --> 00:59:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Columbia is like a really cool place to</v>
<v Speaker 3>visit.</v>

1424
00:59:15.821 --> 00:59:17.920
<v Speaker 3>I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had friends who've been there,</v>

1425
00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:20.770
<v Speaker 3>I want to go badly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that they're most,</v>

1426
00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:23.020
<v Speaker 3>they saved the most beautiful people</v>
<v Speaker 3>voice,</v>

1427
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:26.030
<v Speaker 3>certainly the most beautiful women on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the planet where the famed,</v>

1428
00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:30.290
<v Speaker 3>it's just amazing that they bounced back</v>
<v Speaker 3>so quickly from being under control of a</v>

1429
00:59:30.291 --> 00:59:30.860
<v Speaker 3>drug,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lord.</v>

1430
00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:32.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that the Pablo Escobar story is</v>

1431
00:59:32.601 --> 00:59:34.610
<v Speaker 3>so goddamn crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is crazy.</v>

1432
00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:37.820
<v Speaker 3>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do not live forever.</v>

1433
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:41.150
<v Speaker 3>Listen to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make coke legal.</v>

1434
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:45.410
<v Speaker 3>It'll solve 80% of our problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just make coke,</v>

1435
00:59:45.411 --> 00:59:46.244
<v Speaker 3>legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Agri,</v>

1436
00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:48.140
<v Speaker 3>just make coke legal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

1437
00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Are we really pretending that whiskey is</v>
<v Speaker 3>any better than coke?</v>

1438
00:59:52.610 --> 00:59:54.560
<v Speaker 3>We really pretending that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know coke.</v>

1439
00:59:54.561 --> 00:59:56.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't do coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coke is even better cause it's</v>

1440
00:59:56.781 --> 00:59:58.990
<v Speaker 3>devastating quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you do a lot of cooked.</v>

1441
00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:01.100
<v Speaker 3>You can drink for 40 years and before</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize you're like,</v>

1442
01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:02.840
<v Speaker 3>holy fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a house or anything else.</v>

1443
01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:06.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah you fucking do below duplo everyday</v>
<v Speaker 3>for three years and come talk to me and</v>

1444
01:00:06.501 --> 01:00:07.530
<v Speaker 3>see how your life works at night.</v>

1445
01:00:07.590 --> 01:00:12.030
<v Speaker 7>I think that less people would be</v>
<v Speaker 7>inclined to do it if you made it legal</v>

1446
01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.720
<v Speaker 7>and then let everybody see the</v>
<v Speaker 7>consequences of its use in a realistic</v>

1447
01:00:15.721 --> 01:00:17.640
<v Speaker 7>way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think probably part of the problem</v>

1448
01:00:17.641 --> 01:00:21.750
<v Speaker 7>with things being illegal is that people</v>
<v Speaker 7>can't choose for themselves.</v>

1449
01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:25.470
<v Speaker 7>And if people can't choose themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's forbidden and forbidden things</v>

1450
01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:30.440
<v Speaker 3>just like that blank deck back during</v>
<v Speaker 3>the revolutionary war come more tasty.</v>

1451
01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:34.510
<v Speaker 3>They become more test day duck or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>barrier to switching.</v>

1452
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:39.280
<v Speaker 7>I mean that's all forbidden and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you can't,</v>

1453
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:41.070
<v Speaker 7>human beings should not be able to tell</v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

1454
01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.070
<v Speaker 7>This is the bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1455
01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:46.030
<v Speaker 7>Human beings should not be able to tell</v>
<v Speaker 7>other human beings what they can or</v>

1456
01:00:46.031 --> 01:00:48.490
<v Speaker 7>can't do with their own bodies where it</v>
<v Speaker 7>doesn't make sense.</v>

1457
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.520
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you have some things that are illegal</v>

1458
01:00:51.521 --> 01:00:55.600
<v Speaker 7>like cigarettes and some things that are</v>
<v Speaker 7>legal like whiskey that I don't have a</v>

1459
01:00:55.601 --> 01:00:57.460
<v Speaker 7>problem with.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Cigarettes being legal and I don't have</v>

1460
01:00:57.461 --> 01:00:59.980
<v Speaker 7>a problem with whiskey being legal and</v>
<v Speaker 7>you should be able do whatever you want,</v>

1461
01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:03.160
<v Speaker 7>but I think it should be with all of the</v>
<v Speaker 7>things like why,</v>

1462
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:05.500
<v Speaker 7>how come these things right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why can't,</v>

1463
01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:08.560
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do you telling me that whiskeys legal,</v>

1464
01:01:08.561 --> 01:01:12.460
<v Speaker 7>but mushrooms aren't like that's what</v>
<v Speaker 7>year is this?</v>

1465
01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:14.050
<v Speaker 7>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Are we pretending?</v>

1466
01:01:14.051 --> 01:01:17.260
<v Speaker 7>We pretending there's no science.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I we in wishcraft days or no?</v>

1467
01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.210
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let me know when the witchcraft days are</v>

1468
01:01:19.211 --> 01:01:21.910
<v Speaker 7>over because I would say witchcraft</v>
<v Speaker 7>should be over now.</v>

1469
01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:23.950
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So if it's over now we have to look at</v>

1470
01:01:23.951 --> 01:01:24.940
<v Speaker 7>science.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

1475
01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.820

<v Speaker 4>then wait for it.</v>

1506
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to write for three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four hours,</v>

1507
01:02:46.321 --> 01:02:49.170
<v Speaker 4>keep doing cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to change my career</v>

1508
01:02:49.171 --> 01:02:53.120
<v Speaker 4>because I'm gonna write a three hour a</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit on how God is a roster foreign.</v>

1509
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.550
<v Speaker 4>How funny is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I wrote stand up and God has Ross</v>

1510
01:02:56.551 --> 01:02:57.750
<v Speaker 4>foreign kept waking my girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going,</v>

1511
01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm writing the funniest shit.</v>

1512
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.370
<v Speaker 4>You're not completed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>

1513
01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:03.540
<v Speaker 4>you wait all this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I looked at it,</v>

1514
01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:06.330
<v Speaker 4>then I passed out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to before my heart could give</v>

1515
01:03:06.331 --> 01:03:08.970
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I looked at the shit I wrote about</v>

1516
01:03:08.971 --> 01:03:13.890
<v Speaker 4>eight hours later and it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was basically God's a roster and he</v>

1517
01:03:13.891 --> 01:03:16.470
<v Speaker 4>speaks like a Jamaican.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was the joke.</v>

1518
01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:19.470
<v Speaker 4>And I thought it was brilliant when I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was fucking doing the blow in the right</v>

1519
01:03:19.471 --> 01:03:21.270
<v Speaker 4>state of mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you captured that idea,</v>

1520
01:03:21.271 --> 01:03:23.190
<v Speaker 4>like if you gave that bit to Dave</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chappelle.</v>

1521
01:03:23.191 --> 01:03:24.750
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He maybe he could make something.</v>

1522
01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:27.270
<v Speaker 4>Not Brian Calvin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's high on cocaine in Jamaica.</v>

1523
01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:30.420
<v Speaker 4>It's like you would need to to figure</v>
<v Speaker 4>out what the fuck you were trying to</v>

1524
01:03:30.421 --> 01:03:32.940
<v Speaker 4>say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I've written things down on</v>

1525
01:03:32.941 --> 01:03:34.340
<v Speaker 4>marijuana and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1526
01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:37.830
<v Speaker 4>I'll figure it out when I'm sober.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then you try to read it when you're</v>

1527
01:03:37.831 --> 01:03:39.870
<v Speaker 4>sober and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell the fuck was my point.</v>

1528
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is the point here?</v>

1529
01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:44.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they did studies on people on drugs.</v>

1530
01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:47.310
<v Speaker 4>I think cocaine and had them play music</v>
<v Speaker 4>musicians and stuff,</v>

1531
01:03:47.311 --> 01:03:49.110
<v Speaker 4>and they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought I was amazing.</v>

1532
01:03:49.111 --> 01:03:50.290
<v Speaker 4>And then they listen to what they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>planning.</v>

1533
01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:50.640
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>psychedelics.</v>

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:57.440
<v Speaker 8>How can you raping her here?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're holding onto her.</v>

1606
01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:00.560
<v Speaker 8>You keeping her inside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Just let her go.</v>

1607
01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:03.110
<v Speaker 8>There's no way she's trying to just go</v>
<v Speaker 8>on for,</v>

1608
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:03.650
<v Speaker 8>can you get</v>

1609
01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:05.030
<v Speaker 3>a whiff of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just on repeat.</v>

1610
01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:05.601
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

1611
01:07:05.601 --> 01:07:06.950
<v Speaker 3>Get away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's trying to get away.</v>

1612
01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:07.551
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1613
01:07:07.551 --> 01:07:10.580
<v Speaker 3>congratulations on all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing funny about rape,</v>

1614
01:07:10.581 --> 01:07:12.410
<v Speaker 3>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this isn't rape and that's why I</v>

1615
01:07:12.411 --> 01:07:13.221
<v Speaker 3>made a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

01:07:13.221 --> 01:07:13.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm holding my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1617
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:17.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a joke about something you</v>

1618
01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:20.750
<v Speaker 3>absolutely know is definitely not rape</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm being ridiculous joke.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>

<v Speaker 3>today's call.</v>

1621
01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:25.101
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

1622
01:07:25.101 --> 01:07:25.731
<v Speaker 3>You're ready.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Don't get mad at me.</v>

1624
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:29.120
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to stop doing this.</v>

1625
01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:31.120
<v Speaker 3>We need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to figure out what to be so</v>

1626
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:31.920
<v Speaker 3>literal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1627
01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:36.920
<v Speaker 3>Being so literal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Start start realizing this with,</v>

1628
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:40.150
<v Speaker 3>we had real problems in the world and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've Kevin space things about</v>

1629
01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.660
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just trying to be funny about the</v>

1630
01:07:41.661 --> 01:07:42.020
<v Speaker 3>Libyan.</v>

1631
01:07:42.020 --> 01:07:43.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't let Chapman's basic grab your</v>

1632
01:07:43.461 --> 01:07:44.210
<v Speaker 3>deck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

1633
01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:45.920
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that that's not what I'm</v>

1634
01:07:45.921 --> 01:07:49.010
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is we just need to be</v>

1635
01:07:49.011 --> 01:07:54.011
<v Speaker 3>super cognizant of the fact that there</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a real highly likelihood that we have</v>

1636
01:07:54.891 --> 01:07:58.010
<v Speaker 3>achieved the highest level of</v>
<v Speaker 3>civilization the world has ever known.</v>

1637
01:07:58.430 --> 01:08:01.040
<v Speaker 3>It's right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we need to be aware of that.</v>

1638
01:08:01.730 --> 01:08:02.930
<v Speaker 3>We made progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

1639
01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.790
<v Speaker 3>in any massive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1640
01:08:04.791 --> 01:08:09.791
<v Speaker 3>and any seemingly important thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to go off on.</v>

1641
01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:14.990
<v Speaker 3>You're taking energy away from</v>
<v Speaker 3>recognizing the fact that we need to,</v>

1642
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.510
<v Speaker 7>the crucial elements of this amazing</v>
<v Speaker 7>thing that we have right now,</v>

1643
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:22.850
<v Speaker 7>and one of the things that we have to do</v>
<v Speaker 7>is we've got to avoid this weird</v>

1644
01:08:22.851 --> 01:08:27.230
<v Speaker 7>tribalism that I keep talking about</v>
<v Speaker 7>tribe I thinking because it's not just</v>

1645
01:08:27.290 --> 01:08:29.630
<v Speaker 7>sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's political,</v>

1646
01:08:29.631 --> 01:08:33.680
<v Speaker 7>it's socioeconomic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's fucking blue collar guy.</v>

1647
01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:34.281
<v Speaker 7>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1648
01:08:34.281 --> 01:08:35.680
<v Speaker 7>you're a fucking person.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1649
01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:36.410
<v Speaker 7>We're all just,</v>

1650
01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:37.340
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in a trap.</v>

1651
01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:38.690
<v Speaker 4>Human beings are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>were,</v>

1652
01:08:38.691 --> 01:08:41.300
<v Speaker 4>were genetically predisposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>tribal.</v>

1653
01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.440
<v Speaker 4>It's US versus them.</v>

1654
01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.000
<v Speaker 7>Pass that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If we're a tribe,</v>

1655
01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:46.230
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we should be tried.</v>

1656
01:08:46.231 --> 01:08:49.040
<v Speaker 7>Planet Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's famous Ronald Reagan's speech.</v>

1657
01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:51.750
<v Speaker 7>Remember that Ronald Reagan's speech,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he gave a speech,</v>

1658
01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:54.000
<v Speaker 7>I'd want to say it's in front of</v>
<v Speaker 7>Congress,</v>

1659
01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:57.780
<v Speaker 7>but he gave a speech where he was</v>
<v Speaker 7>talking about how quickly we would set</v>

1660
01:08:57.781 --> 01:09:00.930
<v Speaker 7>aside our differences if we were</v>
<v Speaker 7>attacked by an alien force from another</v>

1661
01:09:00.931 --> 01:09:01.620
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1662
01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.890
<v Speaker 7>And all of us would realize,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1663
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:06.120
<v Speaker 7>just heat or the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean this is like look very scary</v>

1664
01:09:06.121 --> 01:09:07.920
<v Speaker 7>times.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you remember growing up were the same</v>

1665
01:09:07.921 --> 01:09:10.720
<v Speaker 7>age worried about nuclear war?</v>
<v Speaker 7>We were always worried.</v>

1666
01:09:10.730 --> 01:09:15.730
<v Speaker 7>A real threat of nuclear annihilation</v>
<v Speaker 7>was actually something we all thought</v>

1667
01:09:15.751 --> 01:09:16.830
<v Speaker 7>about every day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>

1668
01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:20.010
<v Speaker 7>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the further we're away from that,</v>

1669
01:09:20.011 --> 01:09:21.780
<v Speaker 7>the more we forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

1670
01:09:21.810 --> 01:09:25.230
<v Speaker 7>but if you just pay attention to Libya,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just pay attention to Afghanistan,</v>

1671
01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:28.410
<v Speaker 7>pay attention to Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 7>pay attention to all sorts of parts of</v>

1672
01:09:28.411 --> 01:09:32.640
<v Speaker 7>the world where North Korea things are</v>
<v Speaker 7>not fucking stable at all.</v>

1673
01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:35.970
<v Speaker 7>We are assuming the thing's going to</v>
<v Speaker 7>stay stable because they're stable right</v>

1674
01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:38.550
<v Speaker 7>here,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we're all on the same God damn</v>

1675
01:09:38.551 --> 01:09:39.370
<v Speaker 7>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1676
01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:42.510
<v Speaker 7>And that's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a real problem.</v>

1677
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:47.160
<v Speaker 7>And I think we're better at figuring</v>
<v Speaker 7>this out than we have ever been before.</v>

1678
01:09:47.161 --> 01:09:49.050
<v Speaker 7>But there's a lot of hiccups and bumps</v>
<v Speaker 7>along the way.</v>

1679
01:09:49.051 --> 01:09:51.720
<v Speaker 7>But one of the things it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 7>eliminate a good percentage of them is</v>

1680
01:09:51.721 --> 01:09:56.721
<v Speaker 7>if we can isolate tribalism and see it</v>
<v Speaker 7>when it's happening and call it for what</v>

1681
01:09:57.811 --> 01:09:58.830
<v Speaker 7>it is and avoid it.</v>

1682
01:09:59.190 --> 01:10:01.100
<v Speaker 4>And it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very tough now the tough,</v>

1683
01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:04.400
<v Speaker 4>and I'll tell you why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they used to be one of the great</v>

1684
01:10:04.510 --> 01:10:08.270
<v Speaker 4>people always was talking about how</v>
<v Speaker 4>religion was responsible for so much</v>

1685
01:10:08.271 --> 01:10:09.470
<v Speaker 4>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they always forget.</v>

1686
01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:12.530
<v Speaker 4>Religion was also responsible for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>great deal of unification.</v>

1687
01:10:12.531 --> 01:10:14.300
<v Speaker 4>So there was a national narrative in</v>
<v Speaker 4>this country,</v>

1688
01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:16.100
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were a Christian nation for a long</v>

1689
01:10:16.101 --> 01:10:17.930
<v Speaker 4>time in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there was a national narrative.</v>

1690
01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:22.160
<v Speaker 4>There were just certain things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>people collectively agreed upon.</v>

1691
01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:26.510
<v Speaker 4>And usually it started in the church,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or at least it had its values in the</v>

1692
01:10:26.511 --> 01:10:28.100
<v Speaker 4>church.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would argue that,</v>

1693
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:31.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even our constitution has been greatly</v>

1694
01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:35.370
<v Speaker 4>influenced by the Judeo Christian ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1695
01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:37.100
<v Speaker 4>all men are created equal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

1696
01:10:37.101 --> 01:10:38.320
<v Speaker 4>as a Christian idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you,</v>

1697
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:40.220
<v Speaker 4>there's no way to prove it biologically</v>
<v Speaker 4>are mathematically,</v>

1698
01:10:40.221 --> 01:10:42.800
<v Speaker 4>but it's something we all kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a nice starting point.</v>

1699
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:45.680
<v Speaker 4>It's literally what our justice system</v>
<v Speaker 4>is predicated on.</v>

1700
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:48.290
<v Speaker 4>All men are created equal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though Lebron James and I have</v>

1701
01:10:48.291 --> 01:10:50.930
<v Speaker 4>totally different genomes and he's an</v>
<v Speaker 4>Avatar and we're not equal.</v>

1702
01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:53.040
<v Speaker 4>If you kill me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you kill Lebron.</v>

1703
01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:55.400
<v Speaker 4>You do the same amount of time in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Theoretically,</v>

1704
01:10:55.401 --> 01:10:57.740
<v Speaker 4>that would be the idea behind our thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He should be worth more.</v>

1705
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:59.540
<v Speaker 4>He shouldn't be worth a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 4>than that.</v>

1706
01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:01.610
<v Speaker 4>I would agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would agree.</v>

1707
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:03.710
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what's really interesting is how</v>

1708
01:11:03.711 --> 01:11:06.770
<v Speaker 4>different we are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how we like all strive not to be equal,</v>

1709
01:11:06.771 --> 01:11:08.150
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be better than everybody else,</v>

1710
01:11:08.151 --> 01:11:09.950
<v Speaker 4>but we believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a really nice starting point.</v>

1711
01:11:09.951 --> 01:11:11.390
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that I read that's like really</v>

1712
01:11:11.391 --> 01:11:12.350
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always bring it up.</v>

1713
01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:12.440
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

1714
01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:16.950
<v Speaker 3>people that free will or the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do whatever you want.</v>

1715
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:18.000
<v Speaker 3>The uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1716
01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.660
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a freedom of expression of freedom of</v>

1717
01:11:21.661 --> 01:11:26.661
<v Speaker 3>pursuits breeds inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if you give people true total</v>

1718
01:11:26.761 --> 01:11:29.130
<v Speaker 3>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people are going to try harder than</v>

1719
01:11:29.131 --> 01:11:31.500
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people are going to be a bad thing.</v>

1720
01:11:31.501 --> 01:11:34.080
<v Speaker 3>Some people want to be Tyler Perry and</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a fucking island.</v>

1721
01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:34.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did the big,</v>

1722
01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:36.390
<v Speaker 3>they remembered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a fundamental difference,</v>

1723
01:11:36.391 --> 01:11:37.200
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well Simmons,</v>

1724
01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:40.560
<v Speaker 3>between being American and a communist</v>
<v Speaker 3>and American believes in equality of</v>

1725
01:11:40.561 --> 01:11:41.850
<v Speaker 3>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying we have that,</v>

1726
01:11:41.851 --> 01:11:44.610
<v Speaker 3>but that would be the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's equality of outcome.</v>

1727
01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:47.730
<v Speaker 3>The only way to have equality of outcome</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to keep down the people that work</v>

1728
01:11:47.731 --> 01:11:49.320
<v Speaker 3>harder at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're smarter and more talented.</v>

1729
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:51.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to make everybody equal.</v>

1730
01:11:51.090 --> 01:11:53.550
<v Speaker 3>That's to me a fundamental evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>

1731
01:11:53.551 --> 01:11:55.620
<v Speaker 3>that's my problem with Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck you,</v>

1732
01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:59.970
<v Speaker 3>the only way to do this with force,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the problem is it's never worked.</v>

1733
01:12:00.030 --> 01:12:02.340
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sent everyone worked and it almost</v>

1734
01:12:02.341 --> 01:12:04.230
<v Speaker 3>always leads to like mass murder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1735
01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:06.660
<v Speaker 3>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nobody wants to think that because</v>

1736
01:12:06.661 --> 01:12:08.280
<v Speaker 3>the idea behind is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1737
01:12:08.281 --> 01:12:12.530
<v Speaker 3>so need to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should just share money and Sharewell</v>

1738
01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:15.750
<v Speaker 3>Pol Pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mao Tse Tung Hitler and Stalin</v>

1739
01:12:15.751 --> 01:12:17.940
<v Speaker 3>dictatorships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitler was more of a fascist.</v>

1740
01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:21.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People also don't realize that the Nazis</v>

1741
01:12:21.271 --> 01:12:24.240
<v Speaker 3>were the national socialists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1742
01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.630
<v Speaker 3>The real problem with the idea in</v>
<v Speaker 3>execution,</v>

1743
01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:32.490
<v Speaker 3>but the idea in the most romantic view</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible is that we don't need to</v>

1744
01:12:32.491 --> 01:12:34.290
<v Speaker 3>compete with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't need to be greedy.</v>

1745
01:12:34.291 --> 01:12:37.740
<v Speaker 3>And then we could all share resources</v>
<v Speaker 3>and wealth and we all get along and have</v>

1746
01:12:37.741 --> 01:12:40.260
<v Speaker 3>income equality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I see this,</v>

1747
01:12:40.261 --> 01:12:45.150
<v Speaker 3>I think it's important to recognize the</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought behind the best version of that.</v>

1748
01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:47.310
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thought behind the best version of</v>

1749
01:12:47.311 --> 01:12:49.500
<v Speaker 3>that is someone that just really wants</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be an amazing person.</v>

1750
01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:51.210
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they really want other people to be</v>

1751
01:12:51.211 --> 01:12:53.730
<v Speaker 3>amazing people as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want everybody to be fine.</v>

1752
01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.270
<v Speaker 3>They strive for everybody to get along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's just like combine our wealth.</v>

1753
01:12:57.271 --> 01:12:58.740
<v Speaker 3>We don't have to get rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>delicious,</v>

1754
01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:01.230
<v Speaker 3>like provide for the poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's super important.</v>

1755
01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:03.780
<v Speaker 3>Let's like give healthcare to everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>before anything.</v>

1756
01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:05.130
<v Speaker 3>Hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't need the military.</v>

1757
01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:06.120
<v Speaker 3>Let's just relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1758
01:13:06.121 --> 01:13:07.740
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get invaded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1759
01:13:08.040 --> 01:13:10.250
<v Speaker 3>As a matter of time before the Russian</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows borders.</v>

1760
01:13:10.251 --> 01:13:11.490
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're going to fuck your mouth.</v>

1761
01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.470
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But on that,</v>

1762
01:13:13.471 --> 01:13:14.850
<v Speaker 3>let me pick it back up and doing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>

1763
01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:19.080
<v Speaker 3>Remember that the idea of Adam Smith's</v>
<v Speaker 3>idea and the idea behind making money</v>

1764
01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:22.010
<v Speaker 3>was also that when you are rich and when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were an Aristocrat,</v>

1765
01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:24.960
<v Speaker 3>you have a responsibility to give back</v>
<v Speaker 3>to your community.</v>

1766
01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:26.230
<v Speaker 3>That's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>

1767
01:13:26.370 --> 01:13:29.910
<v Speaker 3>that was very much ingrained in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>British sensibility and even in the</v>

1768
01:13:29.911 --> 01:13:32.220
<v Speaker 3>American aristocracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Kennedy's in this country,</v>

1769
01:13:32.970 --> 01:13:34.590
<v Speaker 3>rich and you have a responsibility.</v>

1770
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:35.341
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Gates,</v>

1771
01:13:35.341 --> 01:13:38.100
<v Speaker 3>one of the boys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll cases in gendered himself with a</v>

1772
01:13:38.101 --> 01:13:40.800
<v Speaker 3>lot of us is that if he does an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of charity,</v>

1773
01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:41.920
<v Speaker 3>amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing,</v>

1774
01:13:41.970 --> 01:13:44.670
<v Speaker 3>creative with it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way still lives like a</v>

1775
01:13:44.671 --> 01:13:47.410
<v Speaker 3>fucking gangster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even like it's putting a dent</v>

1776
01:13:47.411 --> 01:13:49.060
<v Speaker 3>in his lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's,</v>

1777
01:13:49.061 --> 01:13:51.900
<v Speaker 3>he's helping so many people out with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Gates Foundation.</v>

1778
01:13:51.930 --> 01:13:53.750
<v Speaker 3>That's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Warren Buffet gave his kids up,</v>

1779
01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:55.890
<v Speaker 3>now it's up to $7 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

1780
01:13:55.891 --> 01:13:57.500
<v Speaker 3>go make the world a better place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1781
01:13:57.630 --> 01:13:59.580
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's got all kinds of charities.</v>

1782
01:13:59.581 --> 01:14:02.220
<v Speaker 3>But that is by all accounts a super</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweet guy.</v>

1783
01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're really humble.</v>

1784
01:14:03.241 --> 01:14:05.490
<v Speaker 3>But went back to what you were talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about about how we're breaking into</v>

1785
01:14:05.491 --> 01:14:09.960
<v Speaker 3>tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that we have lost any kind of</v>

1786
01:14:09.961 --> 01:14:11.980
<v Speaker 3>national narrative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what I mean by</v>

1787
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.350
<v Speaker 3>that is that people don't even trust</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own institutions with the</v>

1788
01:14:14.351 --> 01:14:16.660
<v Speaker 3>crumbling of any kind of like religious</v>
<v Speaker 3>institution.</v>

1789
01:14:17.140 --> 01:14:20.410
<v Speaker 3>It seems that now people are looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

1790
01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:24.490
<v Speaker 3>they don't trust main sources of</v>
<v Speaker 3>information so they don't trust most of</v>

1791
01:14:24.491 --> 01:14:27.400
<v Speaker 3>the mainstream media has earned their</v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty reputation.</v>

1792
01:14:27.401 --> 01:14:30.320
<v Speaker 3>Cause now it's about clickbait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's about kind of creating some</v>

1793
01:14:30.321 --> 01:14:31.570
<v Speaker 3>that you want to be first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not True.</v>

1794
01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:36.580
<v Speaker 3>Being true is not as important as being</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first one with the story and Blah,</v>

1795
01:14:36.581 --> 01:14:37.330
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

1796
01:14:37.330 --> 01:14:40.330
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's certainly our</v>
<v Speaker 3>agendas with liberal media,</v>

1797
01:14:40.331 --> 01:14:42.550
<v Speaker 3>conservative media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they both have their own agendas of shit</v>

1798
01:14:42.551 --> 01:14:43.660
<v Speaker 3>that people do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1799
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:48.010
<v Speaker 3>So what happens is people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think media's favor abilities and the</v>

1800
01:14:48.011 --> 01:14:51.190
<v Speaker 3>single fucking digits or something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that though among most Americans.</v>

1801
01:14:51.191 --> 01:14:52.930
<v Speaker 3>Let me give you an example of how this</v>
<v Speaker 3>works.</v>

1802
01:14:52.931 --> 01:14:55.630
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm somebody who wrote a good article</v>

1803
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:59.050
<v Speaker 3>about the debate that Eddie Bravo and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>had about the world being flat,</v>

1804
01:14:59.350 --> 01:15:00.250
<v Speaker 3>but the art,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1805
01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:05.370
<v Speaker 3>the title of the article was Joe Rogan</v>
<v Speaker 3>argues with someone about the world</v>

1806
01:15:05.801 --> 01:15:06.640
<v Speaker 3>being flat.</v>

1807
01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:11.740
<v Speaker 3>So it seems like you saying that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world is flat,</v>

1808
01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:15.540
<v Speaker 3>so you immediately click it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but right away the first sentence has,</v>

1809
01:15:15.550 --> 01:15:19.660
<v Speaker 3>God bless Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he was in a conversation with</v>

1810
01:15:19.661 --> 01:15:22.060
<v Speaker 3>his friend who was arguing with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility and then like,</v>

1811
01:15:22.240 --> 01:15:22.781
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1812
01:15:22.781 --> 01:15:23.830
<v Speaker 3>I see what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1813
01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:26.640
<v Speaker 3>I kind of let you hooked him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got it.</v>

1814
01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:27.680
<v Speaker 3>You did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You did it right.</v>

1815
01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:29.650
<v Speaker 3>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But because of that,</v>

1816
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:31.390
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though it's very insignificant,</v>

1817
01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:33.430
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of people have said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro,</v>

1818
01:15:33.431 --> 01:15:35.140
<v Speaker 3>you used to believe the fucking earth</v>
<v Speaker 3>was flat.</v>

1819
01:15:35.141 --> 01:15:36.160
<v Speaker 3>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1820
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:38.150
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1821
01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:41.860
<v Speaker 3>I bet you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't see CNN and Huffington post</v>

1822
01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:43.570
<v Speaker 3>both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they all do that?</v>

1823
01:15:43.571 --> 01:15:45.790
<v Speaker 3>I can't stand either one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think CNN,</v>

1824
01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:49.150
<v Speaker 3>Huffington post started terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but both of them do that.</v>

1825
01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:49.720
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>

1826
01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:50.710
<v Speaker 3>they'll hit you with this.</v>

1827
01:15:50.710 --> 01:15:54.850
<v Speaker 3>Like Donald Trump just said one word to</v>
<v Speaker 3>change the entire presidency.</v>

1828
01:15:55.810 --> 01:15:58.000
<v Speaker 3>Let me see what the fuck you fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1829
01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.430
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keith Olbermann is signed off is one of</v>

1830
01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:02.380
<v Speaker 3>my favorite things to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like him.</v>

1831
01:16:02.710 --> 01:16:05.680
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a a spicy character,</v>

1832
01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.180
<v Speaker 3>super liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I liked him anyway.</v>

1833
01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.120
<v Speaker 3>We're liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think you have to have that look.</v>

1834
01:16:10.121 --> 01:16:13.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least who I am right now.</v>

1835
01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:16.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm an open minded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>friendly person that allows for all</v>

1836
01:16:16.841 --> 01:16:17.720
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1837
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:20.980
<v Speaker 3>Keith Olbermann is as far left as you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get.</v>

1838
01:16:20.981 --> 01:16:22.660
<v Speaker 3>And I liked the fact that he was out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1839
01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:27.960
<v Speaker 3>I think having a wacky dude out there</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing in front of a cable access show</v>

1840
01:16:28.721 --> 01:16:31.780
<v Speaker 3>background with red on one side and blue</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the other.</v>

1841
01:16:31.781 --> 01:16:35.110
<v Speaker 3>And he's got his notes in front of them</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's wearing a tie and delivers</v>

1842
01:16:35.111 --> 01:16:38.830
<v Speaker 3>these super eloquent like dissertations.</v>

1843
01:16:39.190 --> 01:16:41.140
<v Speaker 3>But he's decided he's going to step</v>
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>

1844
01:16:41.470 --> 01:16:43.600
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said he's retiring from politics</v>

1845
01:16:43.601 --> 01:16:45.130
<v Speaker 3>because he thinks that donald trump's</v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

1846
01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:47.380
<v Speaker 3>He'd done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks Donald Trump,</v>

1847
01:16:47.381 --> 01:16:50.070
<v Speaker 3>he lists a series of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Keith Overman,</v>

1848
01:16:50.071 --> 01:16:52.650
<v Speaker 3>it says he's retiring from political</v>
<v Speaker 3>Calamari.</v>

1849
01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:55.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he lists a series of things.</v>

1850
01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:57.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're no good for him.</v>

1851
01:16:57.130 --> 01:16:59.290
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking formative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows his shit.</v>

1852
01:16:59.291 --> 01:17:01.400
<v Speaker 3>I would not want to debate that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what to say.</v>

1853
01:17:01.401 --> 01:17:03.340
<v Speaker 3>She did one dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did one thing though.</v>

1854
01:17:03.341 --> 01:17:06.790
<v Speaker 3>That was pretty fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that you knew when that Tomi</v>

1855
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:07.850
<v Speaker 3>Lahren girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1856
01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:11.450
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like a conservative hot chick,</v>

1857
01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.110
<v Speaker 3>hot white girl with blonde hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1858
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:18.620
<v Speaker 3>she put a flag on like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was like holding up a flag and a</v>

1859
01:17:18.621 --> 01:17:23.621
<v Speaker 3>photo and he wrote something about not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't use the flag that way.</v>

1860
01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:29.380
<v Speaker 3>And then Donald Trump Jr tweeted a photo</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the two of them together with her,</v>

1861
01:17:30.171 --> 01:17:34.310
<v Speaker 3>with the flag and keep opening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then wrapped in a flag and said,</v>

1862
01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:36.410
<v Speaker 3>you know something about him being</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>

1863
01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:39.080
<v Speaker 3>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some funny thing that's also caddy to</v>

1864
01:17:39.081 --> 01:17:42.020
<v Speaker 3>say that it stopped being catty with</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking tall ships.</v>

1865
01:17:42.021 --> 01:17:44.600
<v Speaker 3>And I understand you don't like her</v>
<v Speaker 3>because she's a hot girl that's a</v>

1866
01:17:44.601 --> 01:17:47.540
<v Speaker 3>conservative and she says ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit sometimes and she does.</v>

1867
01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:53.020
<v Speaker 3>But like you gotta save your attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't throw rocks at every target.</v>

1868
01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:57.530
<v Speaker 3>You can't stop for every dog that barks</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the way home or you never get home.</v>

1869
01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:00.680
<v Speaker 3>This is why George Washington talked</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the importance of civility.</v>

1870
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:04.130
<v Speaker 3>You need civility if you start attacking</v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

1871
01:18:04.131 --> 01:18:06.950
<v Speaker 3>If I start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know I heard a rumor that Donald</v>

1872
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:09.220
<v Speaker 3>Trump in meetings when he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>negotiating somebody car,</v>

1873
01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:10.041
<v Speaker 3>he go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus,</v>

1874
01:18:10.041 --> 01:18:11.360
<v Speaker 3>your breath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy fuck.</v>

1875
01:18:11.361 --> 01:18:13.670
<v Speaker 3>You get the worst breath and the age</v>
<v Speaker 3>just gets you on your heels.</v>

1876
01:18:13.671 --> 01:18:14.690
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does it do that?</v>

1877
01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he apparently,</v>

1878
01:18:15.621 --> 01:18:16.910
<v Speaker 3>that was some of the tactics.</v>

1879
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:19.670
<v Speaker 3>He would just insult you and get you off</v>
<v Speaker 3>your pins.</v>

1880
01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:21.980
<v Speaker 3>You're emotional and you're insecure</v>
<v Speaker 3>about your breath.</v>

1881
01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.480
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't talk as much.</v>

1882
01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:26.900
<v Speaker 3>You know the little techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Donald Trump would be super fun</v>

1883
01:18:26.901 --> 01:18:29.900
<v Speaker 3>if he was like your uncle that you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to take your girlfriend to when</v>

1884
01:18:29.901 --> 01:18:32.750
<v Speaker 3>you first started dating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like say if you dated a girl and it's</v>

1885
01:18:32.751 --> 01:18:35.120
<v Speaker 3>like three months in and you're in love</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're,</v>

1886
01:18:35.121 --> 01:18:36.860
<v Speaker 3>you're parked outside your uncle's house</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>

1887
01:18:36.861 --> 01:18:38.420
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to spark,</v>

1888
01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:41.480
<v Speaker 3>sparked this joint and we're going to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>meet my fucking crazy uncle.</v>

1889
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:44.090
<v Speaker 3>He's beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's flawed,</v>

1890
01:18:44.091 --> 01:18:47.690
<v Speaker 3>but he's crazy and don't look at his</v>
<v Speaker 3>hair and we're just going to leave.</v>

1891
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:51.950
<v Speaker 3>And then like</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he talks about himself,</v>

1892
01:18:51.951 --> 01:18:54.710
<v Speaker 3>just seem fascinated and you passed the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys are lucky.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that you're barely alive.</v>

1894
01:18:59.270 --> 01:19:02.120
<v Speaker 3>So you got like 180 beats per minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your Heart's going.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Those guys at the same guy.</v>

1900

<v Speaker 3>The same guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same Guy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Same Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh caddy for all the one number makes it</v>

1902
01:19:15.491 --> 01:19:17.310
<v Speaker 3>sound like there's three camps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1903
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:18.460
<v Speaker 3>I wish.</v>

1904
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:19.730
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

1905
01:19:19.731 --> 01:19:23.030
<v Speaker 3>he said Best Golfer in the group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands down by far.</v>

1906
01:19:23.031 --> 01:19:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

1907
01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:26.800
<v Speaker 3>and t they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't like trump but,</v>

1908
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:31.810
<v Speaker 3>but basically said he's very nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very funny and crack them as they looked</v>

1909
01:19:32.571 --> 01:19:33.090
<v Speaker 3>at me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1910
01:19:33.090 --> 01:19:35.090
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Cameron was like,</v>

1911
01:19:35.130 --> 01:19:37.310
<v Speaker 3>I think it got to be a lot on your</v>
<v Speaker 3>plate.</v>

1912
01:19:37.311 --> 01:19:40.850
<v Speaker 3>And then apparently he drove by there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just club and key largo whenever Mar</v>

1913
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Largo and these people were there and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>just bought as they were driving by in</v>

1914
01:19:44.151 --> 01:19:44.984
<v Speaker 3>the car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

1916
01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:48.890
<v Speaker 3>you're in the best club in the world.</v>

1917
01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:51.010
<v Speaker 3>And he just kept driving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1918
01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:52.690
<v Speaker 3>he's a very entertaining dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1919
01:19:52.691 --> 01:19:55.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little bummed out at myself that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't do celebrity apprentice.</v>

1920
01:19:56.210 --> 01:19:57.080
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1921
01:19:57.081 --> 01:19:59.540
<v Speaker 3>Because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the celebrity apprentice was available</v>

1922
01:19:59.541 --> 01:20:03.650
<v Speaker 3>when we were doing the second run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fear factor and they asked me to do it</v>

1923
01:20:03.651 --> 01:20:05.330
<v Speaker 3>and I was one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were on NBC.</v>

1924
01:20:05.331 --> 01:20:05.961
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

1925
01:20:05.961 --> 01:20:10.290
<v Speaker 3>I want to move my family to New York for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a few months and like maybe,</v>

1926
01:20:10.291 --> 01:20:13.110
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mrs Rogan was down for it,</v>

1927
01:20:13.111 --> 01:20:15.450
<v Speaker 3>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's a smart move.</v>

1928
01:20:15.451 --> 01:20:18.180
<v Speaker 3>It seems like a lot of work for</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that's not really my thing.</v>

1929
01:20:18.181 --> 01:20:20.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really want it do it that kind</v>

1930
01:20:20.611 --> 01:20:22.650
<v Speaker 3>of wish I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has no trump.</v>

1931
01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:24.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how well you get to know</v>

1932
01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:25.890
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get to know him.</v>

1933
01:20:25.891 --> 01:20:27.190
<v Speaker 3>If you let me hang onto them.</v>

1934
01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:29.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he's letting me be close to</v>

1935
01:20:29.221 --> 01:20:31.140
<v Speaker 3>smell you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he'd be a blast.</v>

1936
01:20:31.141 --> 01:20:33.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he'd be a lot of fun because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those lives.</v>

1937
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:35.400
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I could talk to them to fix</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1938
01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:37.470
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we could just tell him to just</v>
<v Speaker 3>take it down a notch.</v>

1939
01:20:37.471 --> 01:20:38.850
<v Speaker 3>It would be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not interested in,</v>

1940
01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:41.190
<v Speaker 3>the problem with him is that he's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in what he doesn't know.</v>

1941
01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:42.130
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how I feel.</v>

1942
01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:45.440
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I feel like we could have a sit in</v>
<v Speaker 3>with homeboy.</v>

1943
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:47.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to just him.</v>

1944
01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.530
<v Speaker 3>You get him on his podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come out.</v>

1945
01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:51.870
<v Speaker 3>It's wearing him out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just relax.</v>

1946
01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:53.760
<v Speaker 3>Relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He never drinks.</v>

1947
01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:56.460
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't course that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's part of the problem.</v>

1948
01:20:56.670 --> 01:20:59.790
<v Speaker 3>Like you need a separation from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal states of consciousness.</v>

1949
01:20:59.791 --> 01:21:02.340
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you're acting on momentum your</v>
<v Speaker 3>entire life,</v>

1950
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:03.810
<v Speaker 3>so you like a child.</v>

1951
01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:06.090
<v Speaker 3>They did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did a psychological profile that I</v>

1952
01:21:06.091 --> 01:21:07.980
<v Speaker 3>thought it was interesting on him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was that he's always been on the</v>

1953
01:21:07.981 --> 01:21:11.040
<v Speaker 3>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So his dad wasn't allowed to be part of</v>

1954
01:21:11.041 --> 01:21:14.460
<v Speaker 3>the developers in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had to go elsewhere and he was always</v>

1955
01:21:14.461 --> 01:21:17.160
<v Speaker 3>kind of like kept out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he is now in the media.</v>

1956
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:18.520
<v Speaker 3>So his way of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1957
01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:22.540
<v Speaker 3>and I think Roy Cohn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the infamous lawyer,</v>

1958
01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:25.740
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was his mentor and said,</v>

1959
01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:28.440
<v Speaker 3>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always attack to meet any threat with an</v>

1960
01:21:28.441 --> 01:21:30.180
<v Speaker 3>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He listened to the reason why he's</v>

1961
01:21:30.181 --> 01:21:34.350
<v Speaker 3>president is because Obama mocked him at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the press corps conference.</v>

1962
01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:37.620
<v Speaker 3>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that press corps dinner meeting</v>

1963
01:21:37.621 --> 01:21:40.050
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Obama mocked him and said,</v>

1964
01:21:40.051 --> 01:21:41.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm one thing that you're never going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>

1965
01:21:41.611 --> 01:21:43.710
<v Speaker 3>And that's the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's go,</v>

1966
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.903
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for real?</v>

1967
01:21:44.970 --> 01:21:46.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking older than you knew.</v>

1968
01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:48.570
<v Speaker 3>Can I lock?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm ridiculous.</v>

1969
01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.580
<v Speaker 3>Look at my hair and I'm still going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be the president.</v>

1970
01:21:50.581 --> 01:21:52.980
<v Speaker 3>How about you go fuck yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about you don't know what you're</v>

1971
01:21:52.981 --> 01:21:55.200
<v Speaker 3>dealing with here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about he was amazing.</v>

1972
01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:56.670
<v Speaker 3>He was so amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the debates,</v>

1973
01:21:56.671 --> 01:21:58.410
<v Speaker 3>he was so entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was funny.</v>

1974
01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.600
<v Speaker 3>And even George.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Bush said,</v>

1975
01:22:00.601 --> 01:22:02.250
<v Speaker 3>you can't insult your way to the White</v>
<v Speaker 3>House,</v>

1976
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:03.550
<v Speaker 3>my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1977
01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:04.710
<v Speaker 3>you can't change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

1978
01:22:05.010 --> 01:22:06.510
<v Speaker 3>you definitely can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're fighting.</v>

1979
01:22:06.610 --> 01:22:08.010
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like what's,</v>

1980
01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:12.520
<v Speaker 3>what's really ironic is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that's come out to over turn your</v>

1981
01:22:12.530 --> 01:22:17.040
<v Speaker 3>notes things both punters I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do know about is talking shit,</v>

1982
01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:20.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm good at talking shit and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand the strategies behind talking</v>

1983
01:22:20.731 --> 01:22:22.800
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the strategies behind talking</v>

1984
01:22:22.801 --> 01:22:26.790
<v Speaker 3>shit was that Hillary felt very</v>
<v Speaker 3>confident that if she could get donald</v>

1985
01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:30.240
<v Speaker 3>into a position of being the primary</v>
<v Speaker 3>candidate against her,</v>

1986
01:22:30.241 --> 01:22:33.750
<v Speaker 3>she would have an easy path to the White</v>
<v Speaker 3>House because she felt like Donald was</v>

1987
01:22:33.751 --> 01:22:38.751
<v Speaker 3>so ridiculous that there the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>candidates by even being associated with</v>

1988
01:22:39.241 --> 01:22:41.310
<v Speaker 3>him in the same party,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be revolt.</v>

1989
01:22:41.470 --> 01:22:44.610
<v Speaker 3>It would be chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if he won he'd be an easy target.</v>

1990
01:22:44.611 --> 01:22:49.080
<v Speaker 3>And there's all this like written banter</v>
<v Speaker 3>back and forth where she was trying to</v>

1991
01:22:49.081 --> 01:22:51.780
<v Speaker 3>connect him with the most ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1992
01:22:51.781 --> 01:22:52.531
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1993
01:22:52.531 --> 01:22:53.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

1994
01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:58.560
<v Speaker 3>there's just all this like strategy with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ted Cruz where they had this idea of how</v>

1995
01:22:59.050 --> 01:23:00.810
<v Speaker 3>they would make them all look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marginalize,</v>

1996
01:23:00.811 --> 01:23:01.950
<v Speaker 3>easy path,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the White House,</v>

1997
01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:04.470
<v Speaker 3>and he just threw a monkey ridge</v>

1998
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.170
<v Speaker 7>right into that theory.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like stupid.</v>

1999
01:23:08.171 --> 01:23:10.210
<v Speaker 7>I'm the worst person for you to argue.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to say,</v>

2000
01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:12.490
<v Speaker 7>I'm going to say you should be in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Lock her up,</v>

2001
01:23:13.090 --> 01:23:16.990
<v Speaker 7>lock her up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I'll make shit up to make up my own</v>

2002
01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:17.950
<v Speaker 7>facts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If I have to,</v>

2003
01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:22.780
<v Speaker 7>I'll do whatever I want and I'll get</v>
<v Speaker 7>caught on tape talking about how girls</v>

2004
01:23:22.781 --> 01:23:24.250
<v Speaker 7>just let you grab him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The Pussy.</v>

2005
01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.020
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just a few weeks out.</v>

2006
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:27.190
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no problem.</v>

2007
01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.250
<v Speaker 7>It was locker room talk.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not a problem.</v>

2008
01:23:30.251 --> 01:23:31.660
<v Speaker 7>Let's talk about uranium.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dude,</v>

2009
01:23:31.661 --> 01:23:33.190
<v Speaker 7>I thought he was done when I heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I thought,</v>

2010
01:23:33.191 --> 01:23:34.850
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's definitely done no precedent.</v>

2011
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:36.970
<v Speaker 7>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What's really shocking?</v>

2012
01:23:37.210 --> 01:23:40.900
<v Speaker 7>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>44% of the white women voted for him</v>

2013
01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:43.510
<v Speaker 7>because they want that Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2014
01:23:43.511 --> 01:23:45.280
<v Speaker 7>they weren't that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They weren't that offended by it,</v>

2015
01:23:45.281 --> 01:23:46.400
<v Speaker 7>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2016
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:49.210
<v Speaker 7>This is a lot of women right now that</v>
<v Speaker 7>just shut off this podcast.</v>

2017
01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:52.090
<v Speaker 7>You fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right when I was starting to think you</v>

2018
01:23:52.091 --> 01:23:54.220
<v Speaker 7>weren't an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just comedy.</v>

2019
01:23:54.221 --> 01:23:57.610
<v Speaker 7>I don't really think that 44%.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think people didn't like Hillary.</v>

2020
01:23:57.611 --> 01:24:01.090
<v Speaker 7>They didn't trust her.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think if you looked at what it is in</v>

2021
01:24:01.091 --> 01:24:02.500
<v Speaker 7>terms of like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2022
01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:07.470
<v Speaker 7>like good versus evil,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's known evil versus unknown,</v>

2023
01:24:07.930 --> 01:24:08.570
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was,</v>

2024
01:24:08.570 --> 01:24:10.990
<v Speaker 7>I think it's unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's known evil or known corruption</v>

2025
01:24:10.991 --> 01:24:15.310
<v Speaker 7>versus a sideshow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like sort of a guy who's going to be</v>

2026
01:24:15.610 --> 01:24:17.890
<v Speaker 7>really entertaining for the next four</v>
<v Speaker 7>years but probably won't bring the</v>

2027
01:24:17.891 --> 01:24:20.500
<v Speaker 7>republic down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But what if he decides to really look</v>

2028
01:24:20.501 --> 01:24:23.290
<v Speaker 7>out for the American people?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What if he decides to make America great</v>

2029
01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:25.030
<v Speaker 7>again?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What if he decides to bring back</v>

2030
01:24:25.330 --> 01:24:30.330
<v Speaker 7>engineering and bring back production of</v>
<v Speaker 7>goods and fucking what if he decides</v>

2031
01:24:30.611 --> 01:24:33.490
<v Speaker 7>that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>What if you really decided that then is</v>

2032
01:24:33.491 --> 01:24:34.390
<v Speaker 7>it better to take a chance?</v>

2033
01:24:34.450 --> 01:24:36.250
<v Speaker 7>And I think a lot of people did that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I agree.</v>

2034
01:24:36.370 --> 01:24:39.160
<v Speaker 7>And then I also think we were realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and we should,</v>

2035
01:24:39.161 --> 01:24:42.250
<v Speaker 7>this is something we need to all come to</v>
<v Speaker 7>grips with.</v>

2036
01:24:43.080 --> 01:24:46.630
<v Speaker 7>It is irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 7>illogical,</v>

2037
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:51.070
<v Speaker 7>nonsensical,</v>
<v Speaker 7>an antiquated to have one person have</v>

2038
01:24:51.071 --> 01:24:53.470
<v Speaker 7>that much power in the United States of</v>
<v Speaker 7>America.</v>

2039
01:24:53.620 --> 01:24:56.260
<v Speaker 7>It is nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not something we need.</v>

2040
01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:57.820
<v Speaker 7>It is a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a,</v>

2041
01:24:57.850 --> 01:25:01.690
<v Speaker 7>it's a value system and a ruler</v>
<v Speaker 7>leadership system that's designed for</v>

2042
01:25:01.691 --> 01:25:04.090
<v Speaker 7>small groups of people and it works very</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2043
01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:07.900
<v Speaker 7>works very well for groups of hundred</v>
<v Speaker 7>and 50 people at leaves over their</v>

2044
01:25:07.901 --> 01:25:12.400
<v Speaker 7>dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But as soon as you get to 320 million</v>

2045
01:25:12.401 --> 01:25:14.970
<v Speaker 7>people all trapped together on a</v>
<v Speaker 7>landmass,</v>

2046
01:25:15.010 --> 01:25:19.900
<v Speaker 7>you cannot have one dip shit that's good</v>
<v Speaker 7>at insulting people and standing in</v>

2047
01:25:19.901 --> 01:25:22.660
<v Speaker 7>front of a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't care if it's him or the next guy</v>

2048
01:25:22.661 --> 01:25:24.580
<v Speaker 7>or the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's on a assault on Donald Trump.</v>

2049
01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:29.580
<v Speaker 7>It's like one person who figures out a</v>
<v Speaker 7>way to fucking manipulate and dance and</v>

2050
01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:32.830
<v Speaker 7>do his best.</v>
<v Speaker 7>America's got talent,</v>

2051
01:25:32.831 --> 01:25:35.020
<v Speaker 7>fucking preppers,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a presentation,</v>

2052
01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:36.760
<v Speaker 7>presentation,</v>
<v Speaker 7>representation.</v>

2053
01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:39.430
<v Speaker 7>One of those things to get to the point</v>
<v Speaker 7>where people go,</v>

2054
01:25:39.431 --> 01:25:41.320
<v Speaker 7>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the other lady's boring and she keeps</v>

2055
01:25:41.321 --> 01:25:43.210
<v Speaker 7>fainting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Boom and they kill.</v>

2056
01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:45.310
<v Speaker 7>They hit the switch for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2057
01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.350
<v Speaker 7>one of the things that president always</v>
<v Speaker 7>talks about and governors talk about is</v>

2058
01:25:50.351 --> 01:25:52.120
<v Speaker 7>how little power they have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You say that,</v>

2059
01:25:52.121 --> 01:25:55.960
<v Speaker 7>but there's real problems right now with</v>
<v Speaker 7>the environmental protection agency</v>

2060
01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:58.690
<v Speaker 7>being defunded.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's real problems right now with</v>

2061
01:25:58.691 --> 01:26:02.200
<v Speaker 7>them deciding to start drilling in</v>
<v Speaker 7>places in Alaska that people have been</v>

2062
01:26:02.201 --> 01:26:04.370
<v Speaker 7>fighting for them for decades</v>

2063
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:06.960
<v Speaker 3>because they're worried that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>extracting minerals from the ground,</v>

2064
01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:09.080
<v Speaker 3>they're going to ruin these salmon</v>
<v Speaker 3>waterways.</v>

2065
01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:09.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can eat,</v>

2066
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:12.590
<v Speaker 3>he can hit mine judges and he can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can appoint judges.</v>

2067
01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:17.390
<v Speaker 3>You do a lot of things and obviously</v>
<v Speaker 3>that cost is a big stir in political</v>

2068
01:26:17.391 --> 01:26:19.760
<v Speaker 3>discourse and people being active and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2069
01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:24.320
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing like some trans woman</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to a got elected somewhere and gay</v>

2070
01:26:24.321 --> 01:26:27.500
<v Speaker 3>people are getting elected papers and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing a a rebound,</v>

2071
01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:28.910
<v Speaker 3>which is what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does that work?</v>

2072
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:29.850
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

2073
01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:33.800
<v Speaker 3>he's created a lot of civic unrest and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of civic organization on the other</v>

2074
01:26:33.801 --> 01:26:34.850
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the other side.</v>

2075
01:26:34.851 --> 01:26:36.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>David from us talking about that.</v>

2076
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:37.340
<v Speaker 3>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2077
01:26:37.341 --> 01:26:40.490
<v Speaker 3>he just sent me his book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just have to be really careful,</v>

2078
01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:44.300
<v Speaker 3>like really careful of getting tribal</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this.</v>

2079
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:44.970
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

2080
01:26:44.970 --> 01:26:46.670
<v Speaker 3>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate to reiterate this,</v>

2081
01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.120
<v Speaker 3>but I think that in looking at the group</v>
<v Speaker 3>of humans as a whole,</v>

2082
01:26:50.121 --> 01:26:52.850
<v Speaker 3>there's a real problem that on the left</v>
<v Speaker 3>and on the right,</v>

2083
01:26:52.851 --> 01:26:57.290
<v Speaker 3>people have with getting attached to</v>
<v Speaker 3>their particular ideology they've</v>

2084
01:26:57.310 --> 01:27:01.280
<v Speaker 3>adopted and fighting against anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's any different and not coming to</v>

2085
01:27:01.281 --> 01:27:05.660
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a common understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 3>what we really need to get by in this</v>

2086
01:27:05.661 --> 01:27:06.110
<v Speaker 3>plant.</v>

2087
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:07.460
<v Speaker 3>It's called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called a couple of things.</v>

2088
01:27:07.461 --> 01:27:11.210
<v Speaker 3>One is there are different psychological</v>
<v Speaker 3>profiles and I've heard Jordan Peterson</v>

2089
01:27:11.211 --> 01:27:13.680
<v Speaker 3>talk about sort of like the left is</v>
<v Speaker 3>rooted in compassion and the right is</v>

2090
01:27:13.681 --> 01:27:18.681
<v Speaker 3>rooted in respect for the strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then what happens is the way things</v>

2091
01:27:19.101 --> 01:27:23.900
<v Speaker 3>move forward is you have an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have an idea and remember something,</v>

2092
01:27:23.901 --> 01:27:25.790
<v Speaker 3>it's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Human beings,</v>

2093
01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:28.460
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually are weighing two values and</v>

2094
01:27:28.461 --> 01:27:30.530
<v Speaker 3>their head at one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me give you an example.</v>

2095
01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:34.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe in illegal immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I have a lot of compassion for</v>

2096
01:27:34.941 --> 01:27:36.760
<v Speaker 3>people who are dying to get over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>board.</v>

2097
01:27:36.790 --> 01:27:39.470
<v Speaker 3>If I was a border control agent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would probably be the guy who was</v>

2098
01:27:39.471 --> 01:27:40.940
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on and cause I have no,</v>

2099
01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:41.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2100
01:27:41.971 --> 01:27:44.840
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't mean that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What it means is that I can sometimes</v>

2101
01:27:44.841 --> 01:27:46.820
<v Speaker 3>you way to values in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2102
01:27:46.850 --> 01:27:51.850
<v Speaker 3>Mercy and compassion versus justice and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair play.</v>

2103
01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:53.780
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me propose something to you.</v>

2104
01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is gonna sound crazy for a lot of</v>

2105
01:27:56.541 --> 01:28:00.440
<v Speaker 3>people that were you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A full could call me at one point in</v>

2106
01:28:00.441 --> 01:28:03.350
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe in the future we will not have</v>

2107
01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:06.220
<v Speaker 3>boundaries in terms of places you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to travel,</v>

2108
01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:07.190
<v Speaker 3>not to travel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2109
01:28:07.380 --> 01:28:11.780
<v Speaker 3>One point in time people would truly be</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought of as equal and when that point</v>

2110
01:28:11.781 --> 01:28:14.210
<v Speaker 3>in time happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll allow people to freely travel all</v>

2111
01:28:14.211 --> 01:28:16.220
<v Speaker 3>over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't we do that now?</v>

2112
01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:18.350
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you won't even have to travel.</v>

2113
01:28:18.351 --> 01:28:21.860
<v Speaker 3>I think what's going to happen is when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can interface with another brain and</v>

2114
01:28:21.861 --> 01:28:22.840
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's possible,</v>

2115
01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:26.600
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have an experience about</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it's exactly what it's like to be a</v>

2116
01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:28.430
<v Speaker 3>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly what it's like.</v>

2117
01:28:28.431 --> 01:28:29.750
<v Speaker 3>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can be a woman.</v>

2118
01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:31.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a woman so I can see what</v>

2119
01:28:31.791 --> 01:28:33.860
<v Speaker 3>it's like to have sexual Lebron James,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing,</v>

2120
01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:37.970
<v Speaker 3>what if she would you complain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you put your hands on her hips.</v>

2121
01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:40.130
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm only going to,</v>

2122
01:28:40.131 --> 01:28:45.131
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be able to experience it so</v>
<v Speaker 3>then if I could interface with another</v>

2123
01:28:45.171 --> 01:28:48.050
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we got a real problem because what</v>

2124
01:28:48.051 --> 01:28:49.820
<v Speaker 3>the fuck does that mean about my</v>
<v Speaker 3>identity?</v>

2125
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:52.730
<v Speaker 3>What if they can't?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't pick what brand new</v>

2126
01:28:52.731 --> 01:28:55.460
<v Speaker 3>interface with like you're going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>girl out sex with a little broad james,</v>

2127
01:28:55.670 --> 01:28:59.300

2132
01:29:09.121 --> 01:29:10.100
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what's going to happen.</v>

2133
01:29:10.101 --> 01:29:13.890
<v Speaker 1>So you can have guys like Lebron James</v>
<v Speaker 1>who had these fantastic lives who have</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's going to cost you this much money</v>

2136

2172
01:30:53.341 --> 01:30:54.560
<v Speaker 1>I was gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right a couple of times.</v>

2173
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On a podcast before or after you had gay</v>

2174
01:30:56.941 --> 01:30:57.774
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2175
01:30:57.850 --> 01:31:00.480
<v Speaker 1>this was during,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know if that makes sense.</v>

2176
01:31:00.810 --> 01:31:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Dream I was game of gay in my dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2177
01:31:05.731 --> 01:31:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I'm gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is so not what I'm into.</v>

2178
01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:12.780
<v Speaker 1>And then I knew I was going to have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have sex with my boyfriend who may or</v>

2179
01:31:12.781 --> 01:31:13.860
<v Speaker 1>may not have been Brendan Shop.</v>

2180
01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:14.970
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a big guy,</v>

2181
01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:17.610
<v Speaker 1>a gate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't really bounce back and forth</v>

2182
01:31:17.611 --> 01:31:19.800
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

2183
01:31:19.801 --> 01:31:24.801
<v Speaker 1>I've actually never really had a gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't talk to fattiest Russell,</v>

2184
01:31:25.021 --> 01:31:28.860
<v Speaker 1>cause he'll tell you you're a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all men have some sort of gay</v>

2185
01:31:28.861 --> 01:31:31.860
<v Speaker 1>fantasy somewhere deep in their head or</v>
<v Speaker 1>35 years,</v>

2186
01:31:31.861 --> 01:31:36.861
<v Speaker 1>daddy has had a conversation about truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and versus like plural truths versus one</v>

2187
01:31:37.231 --> 01:31:39.090
<v Speaker 1>fixed truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge debate.</v>

2188
01:31:39.450 --> 01:31:42.870
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like Nicha,</v>

2189
01:31:42.871 --> 01:31:44.470
<v Speaker 1>what would be the guy to talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plural truth.</v>

2190
01:31:44.471 --> 01:31:47.160
<v Speaker 1>So if you look up at a painting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that painting,</v>

2191
01:31:47.161 --> 01:31:48.270
<v Speaker 1>is there different truths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2192
01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:50.100
<v Speaker 1>One is that painting's beautiful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all I know.</v>

2193
01:31:50.101 --> 01:31:50.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful item.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

2194
01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.560
<v Speaker 1>it affects me emotionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the truth.</v>

2195
01:31:52.770 --> 01:31:54.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then a chemist would look at that</v>

2196
01:31:54.331 --> 01:31:54.931
<v Speaker 1>painting and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2197
01:31:54.931 --> 01:31:58.320
<v Speaker 1>you're not really seeing yellow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you're seeing is you know your eyes</v>

2198
01:31:58.321 --> 01:32:00.220
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are at light and then reflect.</v>

2199
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.990
<v Speaker 3>There's a chemical in there and he'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>break down a chemical.</v>

2200
01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:05.000
<v Speaker 3>That's a different layer to truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're saying different kinds of true</v>

2201
01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:06.400
<v Speaker 3>love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2202
01:32:06.610 --> 01:32:08.840
<v Speaker 3>So true love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the,</v>

2203
01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:11.560
<v Speaker 3>that's still a really an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 3>mystery to me because I wonder if that's</v>

2204
01:32:11.561 --> 01:32:14.710
<v Speaker 3>a relationship with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes you're obsessed with</v>

2205
01:32:14.711 --> 01:32:15.251
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2206
01:32:15.251 --> 01:32:17.620
<v Speaker 3>You love them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be obsessed with the idea of</v>

2207
01:32:17.621 --> 01:32:19.940
<v Speaker 3>being the one that can break them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That can be the one that,</v>

2208
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:21.310
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that tames them,</v>

2209
01:32:21.311 --> 01:32:24.880
<v Speaker 3>the one that owns them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one that you know gets them to</v>

2210
01:32:24.881 --> 01:32:27.670
<v Speaker 3>forget about all of the Dick and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>yours.</v>

2211
01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:30.730
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what a lot of relationships are</v>

2212
01:32:30.731 --> 01:32:33.250
<v Speaker 3>predicated on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This terror doesn't notion of</v>

2213
01:32:33.251 --> 01:32:34.300
<v Speaker 3>territoriality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2214
01:32:34.301 --> 01:32:36.070
<v Speaker 3>But does that true love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what we're talking about?</v>

2215
01:32:36.190 --> 01:32:37.320
<v Speaker 3>Does it matter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2216
01:32:37.330 --> 01:32:40.420
<v Speaker 3>but does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what really matter is the moments where</v>

2217
01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:41.470
<v Speaker 3>you are together.</v>

2218
01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:44.470
<v Speaker 3>We truly care about each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the intensity is almost</v>

2219
01:32:44.471 --> 01:32:48.010
<v Speaker 3>overwhelming and the love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the happiness to be with each other.</v>

2220
01:32:48.011 --> 01:32:50.440
<v Speaker 3>It's almost overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is really true.</v>

2221
01:32:50.441 --> 01:32:55.441
<v Speaker 3>Love all the other set of state though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how long does it last?</v>

2222
01:32:55.630 --> 01:32:58.180
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And whether or not you're committed to</v>

2223
01:32:58.181 --> 01:33:01.930
<v Speaker 3>that person as a love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just a love interest,</v>

2224
01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:03.340
<v Speaker 3>but like as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2225
01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:08.760
<v Speaker 3>an inhabitant in your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your realm of truly loved ones.</v>

2226
01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:13.300
<v Speaker 3>Like what is your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your village of Trans Cynical answer for</v>

2227
01:33:13.301 --> 01:33:14.021
<v Speaker 3>you on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2228
01:33:14.021 --> 01:33:16.900
<v Speaker 3>so I know what the Greek says.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So why do you love your children?</v>

2229
01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:18.790
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it about your children that you</v>

2230
01:33:18.791 --> 01:33:20.740
<v Speaker 3>love?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is what socrates said.</v>

2231
01:33:21.130 --> 01:33:22.600
<v Speaker 3>There's kind of an interesting way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at it.</v>

2232
01:33:22.601 --> 01:33:24.820
<v Speaker 3>So he said love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to define.</v>

2233
01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:27.070
<v Speaker 3>You have to define it as love of</v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2234
01:33:27.090 --> 01:33:29.710
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is the one thing man loves more</v>

2235
01:33:29.711 --> 01:33:31.870
<v Speaker 3>than anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about it.</v>

2236
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:34.740
<v Speaker 3>Post it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not close pussies.</v>

2237
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:38.200
<v Speaker 3>Part of it was these may be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>manifestation of what you're trying to</v>

2238
01:33:38.630 --> 01:33:40.060
<v Speaker 3>Ken from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

2239
01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.650
<v Speaker 3>Come on attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why would you breed a,</v>

2240
01:33:42.770 --> 01:33:45.350
<v Speaker 3>you want to get rid of Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goddammit.</v>

2241
01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:46.690
<v Speaker 3>Goddammit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep going.</v>

2242
01:33:46.870 --> 01:33:49.780
<v Speaker 3>You got to think deeper bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I needed to think the next level.</v>

2243
01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:52.210
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it the man loves more than</v>

2244
01:33:52.211 --> 01:33:53.890
<v Speaker 3>anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does he want more than anything</v>

2245
01:33:53.891 --> 01:33:55.060
<v Speaker 3>else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2246
01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:57.010
<v Speaker 3>What does he want you to tell me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In mortality,</v>

2247
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:59.080
<v Speaker 3>you want to live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2248
01:33:59.081 --> 01:34:00.940

<v Speaker 3>with no plus</v>

2249
01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:06.220

<v Speaker 3>expression.</v>

<v Speaker 3>do you want to live forever with no</v>

2251

01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:24.370
<v Speaker 3>You want to live dangerously?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Safely.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what you're saying about any</v>

2258
01:34:28.271 --> 01:34:31.780
<v Speaker 3>mortality is horse shit cause the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mortality without pussy is nonsense.</v>

2259
01:34:32.190 --> 01:34:34.210
<v Speaker 3>Immortality is represented in different</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2260
01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:37.150
<v Speaker 3>Wash legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen to me sweetie.</v>

2261
01:34:37.180 --> 01:34:40.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone is in my circle of friends</v>

2262
01:34:40.241 --> 01:34:44.500
<v Speaker 3>and somebody offers you in mortality</v>
<v Speaker 3>with no pussy or a hundred years and</v>

2263
01:34:44.501 --> 01:34:47.380
<v Speaker 3>pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't take choice number two,</v>

2267
01:34:52.210 --> 01:34:57.210
<v Speaker 3>I would argue that your love of pussy</v>
<v Speaker 3>might be genetically like you've evolved</v>

2268
01:34:57.711 --> 01:34:58.160
<v Speaker 3>to</v>

2269

<v Speaker 4>Your love was he is.</v>

2270
01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:04.370
<v Speaker 4>Is your love of Pussy because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimately want to spread and further</v>

2271

<v Speaker 4>your DNA?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2272
01:35:05.451 --> 01:35:07.370

<v Speaker 4>I think it would be very disrespectful.</v>

2273

<v Speaker 4>You as particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2276
01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:16.020

<v Speaker 4>Gay Folk wouldn't want to be and then</v>

2277
01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:17.840
<v Speaker 4>assess to actually instead of sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2278
01:35:17.841 --> 01:35:19.910
<v Speaker 4>Instead of calling it pussy because the</v>

01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:35.270
<v Speaker 4>He didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't say it.</v>

2287
01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:35.990
<v Speaker 4>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.823
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me too.</v>

2289
01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:41.960
<v Speaker 7>But I think that the idea of not being</v>
<v Speaker 7>in a sexually pleasurable relationship</v>

2290
01:35:43.591 --> 01:35:46.020
<v Speaker 7>with someone for all of eternity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that sounds stupid.</v>

2291
01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:50.730
<v Speaker 4>First of all this he had said they do</v>
<v Speaker 4>with men and women in longterm</v>

2292
01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:52.310
<v Speaker 4>relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what the secret was?</v>

2293
01:35:52.311 --> 01:35:53.900
<v Speaker 4>The long term,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the West and there were C,</v>

2294
01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:56.510
<v Speaker 4>they fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had a deep sexual connection.</v>

2295
01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:58.730
<v Speaker 4>Get the talk out of here that talked to</v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

2296
01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:01.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm just friends with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a deep friendship.</v>

2297
01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:03.740
<v Speaker 4>You want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should want to fuck the person you</v>

<v Speaker 4>should want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck I heard,</v>

2299
01:36:04.910 --> 01:36:07.550

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2300
01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:08.490
<v Speaker 4>Why you make it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is noise.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fingers and noises.</v>

2302
01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:13.800
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck no,</v>

2303
01:36:13.801 --> 01:36:14.634
<v Speaker 4>I don't do that.</v>

2304
01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:17.580
<v Speaker 4>I go and I do a lot of slicking back</v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

<v Speaker 7>That's what I do.</v>

2308
01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:28.040
<v Speaker 7>That's what she does on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In all honesty,</v>

2309
01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:31.310
<v Speaker 7>if you had a choice between living like</v>
<v Speaker 7>a hermit,</v>

2310
01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:32.840
<v Speaker 7>like all bullshit aside,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no jokes,</v>

2311
01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:35.780
<v Speaker 7>living like a hermit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>living like someone who occasionally</v>

2312
01:36:35.781 --> 01:36:39.620
<v Speaker 7>interacts with people but doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 7>any real deep connection with them or</v>

2313
01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:44.750
<v Speaker 7>living like you're in like a wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 7>community of people that you care about</v>

2314
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:49.400
<v Speaker 7>and drinking and carrying on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And hugging each other and laughing and</v>

2315
01:36:49.401 --> 01:36:51.620
<v Speaker 7>joking around and waking up,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hung over and getting breakfast</v>

2316
01:36:51.621 --> 01:36:53.060
<v Speaker 7>together,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and you live for a hundred</v>

2317
01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.800
<v Speaker 4>you want me to get an intellectual?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Want you to know you're talking about</v>

2318
01:36:54.801 --> 01:36:55.770
<v Speaker 4>that right now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the question.</v>

2319
01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:56.560
<v Speaker 4>Now you know you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2320
01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:57.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

2321
01:36:57.170 --> 01:36:59.120
<v Speaker 4>you know what this distinction you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>drawing my friend.</v>

2322
01:36:59.210 --> 01:37:02.330
<v Speaker 4>What can I get philosophical on you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The distinction between socrates and</v>

2323
01:37:02.331 --> 01:37:04.010
<v Speaker 4>Nichi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>socrates said,</v>

2324
01:37:04.011 --> 01:37:08.360
<v Speaker 4>a man should have quiet contempt for his</v>
<v Speaker 4>body and ultimately learn to be a</v>

2325
01:37:08.361 --> 01:37:11.990
<v Speaker 4>complete template of human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just be a brain and your body is</v>

2326
01:37:11.991 --> 01:37:13.250
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As he was dying,</v>

2327
01:37:13.251 --> 01:37:14.150
<v Speaker 4>he drank the hemlock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2328
01:37:14.151 --> 01:37:17.270
<v Speaker 4>why are you guys crying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm living in a shitty shell and it's</v>

2329
01:37:17.271 --> 01:37:20.690
<v Speaker 4>all gross and I'm going onto a better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be in the sky with all the</v>

2330
01:37:20.691 --> 01:37:22.340
<v Speaker 4>great philosophers and neat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She goes,</v>

2331
01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:23.330
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>socrates.</v>

2332
01:37:23.331 --> 01:37:27.290
<v Speaker 4>You said that because you are ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you never got laid.</v>

2333
01:37:27.410 --> 01:37:31.220
<v Speaker 4>So of course you want to negate and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn reason into a tyrant.</v>

2334
01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:33.440
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those seven deadly sins of the</v>

2335
01:37:33.441 --> 01:37:35.960
<v Speaker 4>Christians talk about like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like pride.</v>

2336
01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:37.070
<v Speaker 4>There's another words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2337
01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:41.840
<v Speaker 4>It's called self esteem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Self esteem is a good thing and lost.</v>

2338
01:37:41.870 --> 01:37:43.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sex is a lot of fun.</v>

2339
01:37:43.881 --> 01:37:46.400
<v Speaker 4>Even though he never had sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but literally he never had basically</v>

2340
01:37:46.401 --> 01:37:47.570
<v Speaker 4>never got laid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They even think,</v>

2341
01:37:47.571 --> 01:37:48.321
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he might,</v>

2342
01:37:48.321 --> 01:37:50.960
<v Speaker 4>they think he either got syphilis and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why I died and went crazy.</v>

2343
01:37:50.961 --> 01:37:52.520
<v Speaker 4>Or he was gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either way.</v>

2344
01:37:52.521 --> 01:37:54.110
<v Speaker 4>He never got laid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had a giant mustache.</v>

2345
01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:55.740
<v Speaker 4>Bring up Nietzsche and take a look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>his mustache.</v>

2346
01:37:55.741 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 4>He's talking</v>

2347
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:59.550
<v Speaker 1>about masks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a crazy mustache or code if if</v>

2348
01:37:59.610 --> 01:38:00.330
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was gay.</v>

2349
01:38:00.330 --> 01:38:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he talked about there'll be able to</v>

2350
01:38:02.261 --> 01:38:05.040
<v Speaker 1>make your life a circus and a work of</v>
<v Speaker 1>art and joy,</v>

2351
01:38:05.070 --> 01:38:09.690
<v Speaker 1>everything and live dangerously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be fucking in a mountain when</v>

2352
01:38:09.691 --> 01:38:11.370
<v Speaker 1>you're in a mountain meditating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

2353
01:38:11.371 --> 01:38:13.650
<v Speaker 1>But guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not really engaged in the world.</v>

2354
01:38:13.710 --> 01:38:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I wish she was gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2355
01:38:14.881 --> 01:38:17.490
<v Speaker 1>look at that because there's so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>statutes.</v>

2356
01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:22.200
<v Speaker 1>There's so many dudes that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like real aggro sort of Wall Street type</v>

2357
01:38:22.201 --> 01:38:23.970
<v Speaker 1>guys that are pro Nietzsche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2358
01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:27.050
<v Speaker 1>it'd be awesome if Nietzsche was just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the whole time we was talking,</v>

2359
01:38:27.090 --> 01:38:27.811
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ugly.</v>

2360
01:38:27.811 --> 01:38:28.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2361
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:29.670
<v Speaker 1>good looking guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cox.</v>

2362
01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully that's not the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional ways.</v>

2363
01:38:33.060 --> 01:38:34.680
<v Speaker 1>This is the noise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to think about him making</v>

2364
01:38:34.681 --> 01:38:38.490
<v Speaker 1>behind the spectacles and with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful mustache with a suit on.</v>

2365
01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:40.620
<v Speaker 1>He's doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as they stopped the camera,</v>

2366
01:38:41.550 --> 01:38:43.740
<v Speaker 1>thinking about Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get,</v>

2367
01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:47.520
<v Speaker 1>you're being stereotypical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not licking his lips slurping.</v>

2368
01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:48.500
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at them,</v>

2369
01:38:48.530 --> 01:38:51.630
<v Speaker 1>but look at that face I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a Dick slurp and type face</v>

2370
01:38:51.631 --> 01:38:54.000
<v Speaker 1>things whistle through his mustache when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says fuck,</v>

2371
01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:56.020
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's why he has that mustache in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place,</v>

2372
01:38:56.021 --> 01:38:59.480
<v Speaker 1>so dude's can just really grab it and</v>

2375
01:39:05.970 --> 01:39:10.970
<v Speaker 1>He could grab a hold of them and wrap</v>
<v Speaker 1>them handled Zinger and then use it to</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what's really sad about that</v>

<v Speaker 1>we immediately had so much in common.</v>

01:46:27.310 --> 01:46:29.090
<v Speaker 1>She's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a great character.</v>

2566
01:46:29.091 --> 01:46:31.760
<v Speaker 1>She had to I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was one of those people that was so</v>

2567
01:46:31.761 --> 01:46:33.670
<v Speaker 1>talented like I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she write shit and,</v>

2568
01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:37.100
<v Speaker 1>and she would figure out what was wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a sketch and I would be sewing all</v>

2569
01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:39.680
<v Speaker 1>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then she was a groundling forever.</v>

2570
01:46:39.681 --> 01:46:41.240
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2571
01:46:41.241 --> 01:46:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been doing this forever.</v>

2572
01:46:42.471 --> 01:46:45.860
<v Speaker 1>Like I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never done scratch specific type of</v>

2573
01:46:45.861 --> 01:46:46.760
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2574
01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:48.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very different doing sketches.</v>

2575
01:46:48.591 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very different animal than doing</v>

2576
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:51.960
<v Speaker 7>stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She,</v>

2577
01:46:51.961 --> 01:46:54.420
<v Speaker 7>she was ridiculously funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2578
01:46:56.340 --> 01:47:00.420
<v Speaker 7>It's weird form of comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know those sketch little short</v>

2579
01:47:00.421 --> 01:47:01.620
<v Speaker 7>things,</v>
<v Speaker 7>writing them every week.</v>

2580
01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.440
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the craziest thing about Saturday</v>

2581
01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:04.980
<v Speaker 7>night live.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But yeah,</v>

2582
01:47:04.981 --> 01:47:07.770
<v Speaker 7>like the Chappelle show and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 7>these other shows,</v>

2583
01:47:07.771 --> 01:47:11.250
<v Speaker 7>they had time to develop these sketches</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they weren't doing them all in front</v>

2584
01:47:11.251 --> 01:47:14.760
<v Speaker 7>of a live audience like night live does.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have friends who've gotten Saturday</v>

2585
01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:16.410
<v Speaker 7>night live and that is grueling</v>
<v Speaker 7>schedule.</v>

2586
01:47:16.530 --> 01:47:17.430
<v Speaker 7>They're up all night,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2587
01:47:17.570 --> 01:47:18.870
<v Speaker 7>Kind of an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It seems like,</v>

2588
01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:22.110
<v Speaker 7>well at least coming from Phil Hartman's</v>
<v Speaker 7>explanation of it,</v>

2589
01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:24.590
<v Speaker 7>he said it was very like competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

2590
01:47:24.630 --> 01:47:26.700
<v Speaker 7>The point where people got real hostile</v>
<v Speaker 7>with each other.</v>

2591
01:47:26.701 --> 01:47:29.040
<v Speaker 7>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it was never like a relaxed,</v>

2592
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:30.580
<v Speaker 7>fun environment.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

2593
01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:35.040
<v Speaker 7>in fact when he first came from Saturday</v>
<v Speaker 7>night live and came over to news radio,</v>

2594
01:47:35.041 --> 01:47:39.000
<v Speaker 7>one of the things what he was like a</v>
<v Speaker 7>little standoffish at first and then</v>

2595
01:47:39.001 --> 01:47:42.000
<v Speaker 7>eventually he like realizes like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh these people aren't competing with</v>

2596
01:47:42.001 --> 01:47:42.930
<v Speaker 7>me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're not competing.</v>

2597
01:47:43.010 --> 01:47:44.470
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It took a while though really?</v>

2598
01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:45.201
<v Speaker 7>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2599
01:47:45.201 --> 01:47:47.850
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was like an environment of snl</v>

2600
01:47:47.851 --> 01:47:50.940
<v Speaker 7>that was like super like hyper</v>
<v Speaker 7>competitive and Michael's wants it to be</v>

2601
01:47:50.941 --> 01:47:52.560
<v Speaker 7>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You have to compete to get your sketch</v>

2602
01:47:52.561 --> 01:47:54.990
<v Speaker 7>on and if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you you go away.</v>

2603
01:47:55.410 --> 01:47:57.720
<v Speaker 7>And so it's a very competitive</v>
<v Speaker 7>atmosphere.</v>

2604
01:47:57.930 --> 01:48:01.200
<v Speaker 7>You could see it and felt like fit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And Phil just relaxed after a while he</v>

2605
01:48:01.201 --> 01:48:02.550
<v Speaker 7>relaxed and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2606
01:48:02.551 --> 01:48:02.760
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2607
01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:05.130
<v Speaker 7>we're not competing like you're Phil</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hartman.</v>

2608
01:48:05.190 --> 01:48:07.020
<v Speaker 7>I'm some fucking dude that nobody even</v>
<v Speaker 7>knows.</v>

2609
01:48:07.021 --> 01:48:07.560
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2610
01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:08.850
<v Speaker 7>And were both on a show together.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>

2611
01:48:08.851 --> 01:48:09.684
<v Speaker 7>what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2612
01:48:09.870 --> 01:48:10.681
<v Speaker 7>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh okay,</v>

2613
01:48:10.681 --> 01:48:11.490
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay.</v>

2614
01:48:11.490 --> 01:48:14.460
<v Speaker 7>And then he like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I got deeper and deeper to know him.</v>

2615
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:16.560
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is back in my non weed smoking</v>

2616
01:48:16.561 --> 01:48:17.400
<v Speaker 7>days.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Unfortunately.</v>

2617
01:48:17.401 --> 01:48:20.860
<v Speaker 7>I wish I smoked weed cause he used to</v>
<v Speaker 7>love to smoke weed and yeah,</v>

2618
01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:21.420
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>

2619
01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:23.340
<v Speaker 7>He would,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he would smoke weed after shows and wind</v>

2620
01:48:23.341 --> 01:48:26.130
<v Speaker 7>down and play music and go to strip</v>
<v Speaker 7>clubs and shit.</v>

2621
01:48:26.190 --> 01:48:29.580
<v Speaker 7>He does impossibly funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He was a really interesting guy.</v>

2622
01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:31.170
<v Speaker 7>But you're not like any guy I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 7>met.</v>

2623
01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:33.180
<v Speaker 7>Like legitimately not like any guy I've</v>
<v Speaker 7>ever met.</v>

2624
01:48:33.181 --> 01:48:38.130
<v Speaker 7>Like he had an incredibly unique way of</v>
<v Speaker 7>viewing opportunities and things.</v>

2625
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:40.770
<v Speaker 7>One of the things that happened is he</v>
<v Speaker 7>didn't really make it until he was quite</v>

2626
01:48:40.771 --> 01:48:42.150
<v Speaker 7>old,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2627
01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:43.350
<v Speaker 7>in terms of grounding.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2628
01:48:43.351 --> 01:48:44.920
<v Speaker 7>Or is the second city,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it was brown.</v>

2629
01:48:44.970 --> 01:48:48.390
<v Speaker 7>I think he was cracking city.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He might've been groundling too.</v>

2630
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:51.960
<v Speaker 7>I think you might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I know he was also an artist and he</v>

2631
01:48:51.961 --> 01:48:54.840
<v Speaker 7>did peewee's playhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He did something with peewees play,</v>

2632
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:55.703
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2633
01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:57.240
<v Speaker 7>pee wee herman or an artist like a</v>
<v Speaker 7>painter.</v>

2634
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.691
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

2635
01:48:57.691 --> 01:48:59.520
<v Speaker 7>he needs to make album covers and stuff.</v>

2636
01:48:59.550 --> 01:49:00.140
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was like a,</v>

2637
01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:02.400
<v Speaker 7>like a legit graphic artist.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

2638
01:49:02.430 --> 01:49:04.170
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's a fascinating guy.</v>

2639
01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:06.270
<v Speaker 7>Like when we first did a news radio</v>
<v Speaker 7>together,</v>

2640
01:49:06.271 --> 01:49:08.370
<v Speaker 7>he just decided that he wanted to get</v>
<v Speaker 7>his pilot's license,</v>

2641
01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:11.160
<v Speaker 7>so every time I talked to him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>homeboy and have his pilots book out and</v>

2642
01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:14.310
<v Speaker 7>be going over his fucking pilots book</v>
<v Speaker 7>and going like he was constantly have it</v>

2643
01:49:14.311 --> 01:49:15.750
<v Speaker 7>on the set,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like in between scenes.</v>

2644
01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:18.930
<v Speaker 7>He would do a scene and they would open</v>
<v Speaker 7>up as pilots book and just as obsessed</v>

2645
01:49:18.931 --> 01:49:20.730
<v Speaker 7>with learning how to fly a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My Dad?</v>

2646
01:49:21.390 --> 01:49:23.370
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my father,</v>

2647
01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:25.590
<v Speaker 7>my father was obsessed with that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He got his pilot's license.</v>

2648
01:49:25.591 --> 01:49:26.730
<v Speaker 7>I never got it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>

2649
01:49:26.731 --> 01:49:28.830
<v Speaker 7>I don't know why you care that much.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2650
01:49:28.831 --> 01:49:29.611
<v Speaker 7>you know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>

2651
01:49:29.611 --> 01:49:30.990
<v Speaker 7>It's freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

2652
01:49:31.170 --> 01:49:34.290
<v Speaker 7>especially a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>obviously I can say this now since his</v>

2653
01:49:34.291 --> 01:49:36.510
<v Speaker 7>wife killed him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he had a bad relationship.</v>

2654
01:49:37.650 --> 01:49:41.030
<v Speaker 7>When you have a bad relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you just want to fly these kids too and</v>

2655
01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:42.030
<v Speaker 7>I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't even know.</v>

2656
01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:44.130
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

2657
01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:47.410
<v Speaker 7>Horrible store.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That was a worst.</v>

2658
01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:49.000
<v Speaker 7>I remember talking to you right after</v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

2659
01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:51.370
<v Speaker 7>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is another thing where it was a</v>

2660
01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:54.370
<v Speaker 7>disassociative.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was a psych psych medicine.</v>

2661
01:49:54.371 --> 01:49:58.030
<v Speaker 7>It was zoloft mixed with cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not saying that she wouldn't have done</v>

2662
01:49:58.031 --> 01:50:00.340
<v Speaker 7>that without anything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Not saying that the drugs are</v>

2663
01:50:00.341 --> 01:50:02.260
<v Speaker 7>responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm saying it's,</v>

2664
01:50:02.290 --> 01:50:06.280
<v Speaker 7>it's eerie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How many different violent episodes are</v>

2665
01:50:06.281 --> 01:50:08.500
<v Speaker 7>connected to psych medication.</v>
<v Speaker 7>God,</v>

2666
01:50:08.530 --> 01:50:12.370
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We are fucking with the very way that</v>

2667
01:50:12.371 --> 01:50:16.450
<v Speaker 7>your brain interfaces with reality.</v>
<v Speaker 7>To think that that doesn't have</v>

2668
01:50:16.451 --> 01:50:18.970
<v Speaker 7>consequences is absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's absurd.</v>

2669
01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:22.130
<v Speaker 7>It's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And to think that you can sort of poo</v>

2670
01:50:22.131 --> 01:50:25.270
<v Speaker 7>poo those consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like correlation is not causation.</v>

2671
01:50:25.690 --> 01:50:27.160
<v Speaker 7>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're right,</v>

2672
01:50:27.190 --> 01:50:29.050
<v Speaker 7>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But have you done a study to find out</v>

2673
01:50:29.051 --> 01:50:31.030
<v Speaker 7>what's what,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or have you really dug into it?</v>

2674
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:32.980
<v Speaker 7>Have you looked into these people?</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you find out what they were like,</v>

2675
01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:36.170
<v Speaker 7>is there a way to even back engineer</v>
<v Speaker 7>their personality before you start</v>

2676
01:50:36.171 --> 01:50:37.900
<v Speaker 7>adding drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is there a wet,</v>

2677
01:50:38.290 --> 01:50:39.610
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do you know what the difference between</v>

2678
01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:43.030
<v Speaker 7>depression and psychotic madness's?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

2679
01:50:43.630 --> 01:50:46.780
<v Speaker 7>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I think obviously the people like</v>

2680
01:50:46.781 --> 01:50:47.710
<v Speaker 7>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the vegas shooter,</v>

2681
01:50:47.711 --> 01:50:48.700
<v Speaker 7>nobody knew,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2682
01:50:48.701 --> 01:50:50.320
<v Speaker 7>If nobody knew and he just did that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there's a,</v>

2683
01:50:50.321 --> 01:50:52.390
<v Speaker 7>there's a line that he can cross.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2684
01:50:52.391 --> 01:50:55.210
<v Speaker 7>he's capable of doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't know what that line killed</v>

2685
01:50:55.240 --> 01:50:56.080
<v Speaker 7>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Point is.</v>

2686
01:50:56.170 --> 01:50:58.100
<v Speaker 7>We're not dealing with an exact science.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2687
01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:01.370
<v Speaker 7>We're dealing with something that vary</v>
<v Speaker 7>so widely.</v>

2688
01:51:02.140 --> 01:51:05.980
<v Speaker 7>This for anyone has suggested dosages,</v>
<v Speaker 7>depending on how you react to it.</v>

2689
01:51:06.010 --> 01:51:09.250
<v Speaker 7>Only reason why people are saying it's</v>
<v Speaker 7>fine cause they make money from it.</v>

2690
01:51:09.610 --> 01:51:11.560
<v Speaker 7>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They didn't make money from it.</v>

2691
01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:12.161
<v Speaker 7>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well blah,</v>

2692
01:51:12.161 --> 01:51:12.401
<v Speaker 7>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>blah,</v>

2693
01:51:12.401 --> 01:51:12.641
<v Speaker 7>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>blah,</v>

2694
01:51:12.641 --> 01:51:12.941
<v Speaker 7>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>blah,</v>

2695
01:51:12.941 --> 01:51:14.500
<v Speaker 7>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How many people are being prescribed?</v>

2696
01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:15.220
<v Speaker 7>What?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2697
01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:17.440
<v Speaker 7>why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>How did you try exercise?</v>

2698
01:51:17.500 --> 01:51:18.580
<v Speaker 7>You didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

2699
01:51:18.670 --> 01:51:20.470
<v Speaker 7>so you just took a pill.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're eating sugar all day and you just</v>

2700
01:51:20.471 --> 01:51:22.240
<v Speaker 7>took a pill.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now everything's supposed to go check</v>

2701
01:51:22.241 --> 01:51:23.290
<v Speaker 7>your hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did you do,</v>

2702
01:51:23.291 --> 01:51:24.870
<v Speaker 7>did you do anything other than that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2703
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:27.820
<v Speaker 7>The thyroid medications.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Try Meditation.</v>

2704
01:51:27.850 --> 01:51:30.610
<v Speaker 7>Did you try exercise?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did you try jogging?</v>

2705
01:51:30.670 --> 01:51:31.900
<v Speaker 7>I want you to try jogging for six</v>
<v Speaker 7>months.</v>

2706
01:51:31.901 --> 01:51:33.030
<v Speaker 7>It will give you the pills.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2707
01:51:34.210 --> 01:51:35.530
<v Speaker 7>but can you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but then again,</v>

2708
01:51:35.531 --> 01:51:37.120
<v Speaker 7>is that hypocritical?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Shouldn't,</v>

2709
01:51:37.150 --> 01:51:39.280
<v Speaker 7>if I think coach should be legal,</v>
<v Speaker 7>should I shouldn't,</v>

2710
01:51:39.281 --> 01:51:41.110
<v Speaker 7>I think that people should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 7>take a pill.</v>

2711
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:42.031
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think your,</v>

2712
01:51:42.031 --> 01:51:45.510
<v Speaker 4>your objection to that is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>an entire industry making lots of money</v>

2713
01:51:45.990 --> 01:51:49.870
<v Speaker 4>and making claims about those psychotic</v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs,</v>

2714
01:51:49.890 --> 01:51:51.890
<v Speaker 4>those drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychosomatic,</v>

2715
01:51:51.900 --> 01:51:56.730
<v Speaker 4>whatever the word is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs that may be in many cases are not</v>

2716
01:51:56.731 --> 01:51:59.430
<v Speaker 4>true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that things like PROZAC and</v>

2717
01:51:59.431 --> 01:52:03.120
<v Speaker 4>Zoloft have their place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure they work for some people.</v>

2718
01:52:03.121 --> 01:52:05.250
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact I have family members that</v>

2719
01:52:05.251 --> 01:52:08.040
<v Speaker 4>really do well with Xanax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do as well.</v>

2720
01:52:08.041 --> 01:52:11.340
<v Speaker 4>And I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's just like weed is good for</v>

2721
01:52:11.341 --> 01:52:13.080
<v Speaker 4>some people and other people can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>function.</v>

2722
01:52:13.081 --> 01:52:15.780
<v Speaker 4>I can't really function on marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 4>talk a pretty good right now.</v>

2723
01:52:15.810 --> 01:52:18.600
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I yes I am but,</v>

2724
01:52:18.690 --> 01:52:22.110
<v Speaker 4>but for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it depends on your chemistry in your</v>

2725
01:52:22.111 --> 01:52:23.880
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think what you're objecting to is</v>

2726
01:52:23.881 --> 01:52:26.370
<v Speaker 4>that there is people who get there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are getting very,</v>

2727
01:52:26.371 --> 01:52:28.980
<v Speaker 4>very wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Certainly companies on,</v>

2728
01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:31.040
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2729
01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:34.650
<v Speaker 4>claims that are not measurable and not</v>
<v Speaker 4>always true.</v>

2730
01:52:35.120 --> 01:52:35.930
<v Speaker 7>There's that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2731
01:52:35.930 --> 01:52:39.290
<v Speaker 7>But there's also the same reason why I</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't think a 900 year old dude should</v>

2732
01:52:39.291 --> 01:52:42.420
<v Speaker 7>be able to fuck a 50 year old lady cause</v>
<v Speaker 7>it thinks she's basically like a phobia.</v>

2733
01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:45.790
<v Speaker 7>This is what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that people are goddamn</v>

2734
01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:46.580
<v Speaker 7>vulnerable</v>

2735
01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:50.210
<v Speaker 3>and gullible and when you have these</v>
<v Speaker 3>commercials where there's people walking</v>

2736
01:52:50.211 --> 01:52:53.780
<v Speaker 3>down the street and art cartoon</v>
<v Speaker 3>butterflies are flying around and</v>

2737
01:52:53.781 --> 01:52:56.870
<v Speaker 3>they're all jolly and you're selling</v>
<v Speaker 3>antidepressants and then you start</v>

2738
01:52:56.871 --> 01:53:01.040
<v Speaker 3>listing off be explosive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anal bleeding,</v>

2739
01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:04.790
<v Speaker 3>heart blown out of your fucking chest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the alien movie,</v>

2740
01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.860
<v Speaker 3>Your Dick Falls off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your feet go numb,</v>

2741
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:10.730
<v Speaker 3>you start reading off this thing while</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're showing the same cheerful</v>

2742
01:53:10.731 --> 01:53:15.731
<v Speaker 3>environment and crazy music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that alone shows you that</v>

2743
01:53:16.581 --> 01:53:18.950
<v Speaker 3>there's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just those commercials alone,</v>

2744
01:53:18.951 --> 01:53:21.140
<v Speaker 3>the fact that they exist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they're structured,</v>

2745
01:53:21.410 --> 01:53:26.410
<v Speaker 3>the fact that they have to say all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>horrific side effects for like a minute,</v>

2746
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:30.290
<v Speaker 3>two minutes of the commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a horrific side effect.</v>

2747
01:53:30.530 --> 01:53:34.400
<v Speaker 3>A giant like if you have like</v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimately have and what is commercial</v>

2748
01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:38.900
<v Speaker 3>30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's entirely possible that 15 of those</v>

2749
01:53:38.901 --> 01:53:41.600
<v Speaker 3>30 seconds are going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of you taking this drug</v>

2750
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:46.490
<v Speaker 3>while you're looking at cartoon bunny</v>
<v Speaker 3>rabbits and week flying through the air</v>

2751
01:53:46.491 --> 01:53:50.630
<v Speaker 3>and everybody's smiling and there's a</v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of whistles and fucking piano and</v>

2752
01:53:50.631 --> 01:53:52.820
<v Speaker 3>it seems like everybody's having a grand</v>
<v Speaker 3>old time.</v>

2753
01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're talking about death and</v>

2754
01:53:55.340 --> 01:53:59.630
<v Speaker 3>suicidal thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's psychotic episodes and come on.</v>

2755
01:53:59.631 --> 01:54:02.270
<v Speaker 3>Do you want a really good insight into</v>
<v Speaker 3>how big Pharma works?</v>

2756
01:54:02.271 --> 01:54:05.930
<v Speaker 3>Read Ben Goldacre is but pig farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking bad farm.</v>

2757
01:54:05.931 --> 01:54:10.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called just money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's the same thing as all of it.</v>

2758
01:54:10.130 --> 01:54:14.120
<v Speaker 3>It's tribalism because if you could look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at your team,</v>

2759
01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:17.960
<v Speaker 3>your pharmaceutical team as being you</v>
<v Speaker 3>against everybody else,</v>

2760
01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:22.550
<v Speaker 3>you could figure out a way to sell fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>up drugs to people that you really</v>

2761
01:54:22.551 --> 01:54:24.620
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be selling it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just have to say you want to make</v>

2762
01:54:24.621 --> 01:54:28.790
<v Speaker 3>money cause we're doing this podcast</v>
<v Speaker 3>that my entire act right now,</v>

2763
01:54:28.791 --> 01:54:32.390
<v Speaker 3>my new hour is all about this and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody who's seen me that knows that</v>

2764
01:54:32.391 --> 01:54:34.000
<v Speaker 3>this is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I want to say this.</v>

2765
01:54:34.001 --> 01:54:35.450
<v Speaker 3>Cause you're talking about teens and</v>
<v Speaker 3>tribalism.</v>

2766
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:38.690
<v Speaker 3>The theme of my fucking next hour is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is exactly this,</v>

2767
01:54:38.691 --> 01:54:40.010
<v Speaker 3>how we break up into teams.</v>

2768
01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:42.980
<v Speaker 3>So I just don't want anybody to think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that my next hour has been influenced by</v>

2769
01:54:42.981 --> 01:54:45.920
<v Speaker 3>this fucking podcast cause I love that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking about the same thing.</v>

2770
01:54:45.921 --> 01:54:47.810
<v Speaker 3>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people were thinking</v>

2771
01:54:47.811 --> 01:54:50.960
<v Speaker 3>about this now because as we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>running into this weird situation where</v>

2772
01:54:50.961 --> 01:54:52.960
<v Speaker 3>we realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2773
01:54:52.970 --> 01:54:56.650
<v Speaker 3>our democracy is in some weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2774
01:54:56.780 --> 01:55:00.720
<v Speaker 3>being examined that's being fractured</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't happening.</v>

2775
01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:01.573
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot,</v>

2776
01:55:01.730 --> 01:55:03.760
<v Speaker 3>but it's been examined by people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2777
01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:07.130
<v Speaker 3>They're looking at it from all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 3>different angles in an unprecedented</v>

2778
01:55:07.131 --> 01:55:08.000
<v Speaker 3>manner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2779
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:11.720
<v Speaker 3>And we're looking at the influence that</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia might have had and all this</v>

2780
01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:13.040
<v Speaker 3>Bernie Sanders was going to run in 2020.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

2781
01:55:13.130 --> 01:55:16.160
<v Speaker 3>there's so much going on right now</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's this intense,</v>

2782
01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:21.640
<v Speaker 3>incredibly high level that we're all</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of like caught up in this thing</v>

2783
01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:24.370
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going to happen next.</v>

2784
01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:26.000
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also we're having really trouble</v>

2785
01:55:26.001 --> 01:55:28.530
<v Speaker 3>trouble knowing what to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2786
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:30.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know what to believe and what</v>

2787
01:55:30.861 --> 01:55:31.521
<v Speaker 3>to believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2788
01:55:31.521 --> 01:55:32.690
<v Speaker 3>is this a Bot?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2789
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:34.280
<v Speaker 3>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is twitter?</v>

2790
01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:36.350
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if six people are saying you did</v>

2791
01:55:36.351 --> 01:55:39.600
<v Speaker 3>something and that's it in the why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2792
01:55:39.610 --> 01:55:42.350
<v Speaker 3>how true is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if the stories are all remarkably</v>

2793
01:55:42.351 --> 01:55:44.160
<v Speaker 3>similar now some consistencies,</v>

2794
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:45.300
<v Speaker 4>I he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Charlie rose,</v>

2795
01:55:45.630 --> 01:55:46.680
<v Speaker 4>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do we do?</v>

2796
01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:51.800
<v Speaker 4>It's very interesting time because trans</v>
<v Speaker 4>privacy privacy is dead yet we still</v>

2797
01:55:53.461 --> 01:55:56.780
<v Speaker 4>don't really know what to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2798
01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:58.560
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting information from six</v>

2799
01:55:58.561 --> 01:56:01.470
<v Speaker 4>different sources.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So who's actually telling me the truth</v>

2800
01:56:01.471 --> 01:56:05.190
<v Speaker 4>about that person or that event?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2801
01:56:05.580 --> 01:56:08.070
<v Speaker 4>that's the biggest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's to me.</v>

2802
01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:11.150
<v Speaker 4>And that was one of the biggest shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you add that to click baiting</v>

2803
01:56:11.151 --> 01:56:14.040
<v Speaker 4>as it gets real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets to be a real create cynicism and</v>

2804
01:56:14.041 --> 01:56:18.470
<v Speaker 4>it creates paranoia and it creates the</v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that I can't rely on any,</v>

2805
01:56:18.810 --> 01:56:20.930
<v Speaker 4>the institutions I used to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>rely,</v>

2806
01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:22.830
<v Speaker 4>rely on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's also been an observed</v>

2807
01:56:22.831 --> 01:56:24.960
<v Speaker 4>strategy of really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2808
01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:27.840
<v Speaker 4>inflated headlines that get altered</v>
<v Speaker 4>later.</v>

2809
01:56:27.900 --> 01:56:28.621
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2810
01:56:28.621 --> 01:56:30.120
<v Speaker 4>they say something completely</v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous.</v>

2811
01:56:30.121 --> 01:56:31.740
<v Speaker 4>It's not really represented by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>facts.</v>

2812
01:56:31.741 --> 01:56:34.320
<v Speaker 4>And then they tone it down when people</v>
<v Speaker 4>complain,</v>

2813
01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:36.060
<v Speaker 4>but they got all the initial hits.</v>

2814
01:56:36.090 --> 01:56:37.800
<v Speaker 4>That's when I first novus notice doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2815
01:56:37.950 --> 01:56:42.950
<v Speaker 4>You can sway a vote by saint floating</v>
<v Speaker 4>things anonymously and then by the time</v>

2816
01:56:43.081 --> 01:56:45.810
<v Speaker 4>it comes out that it's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you,</v>

2817
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:50.700
<v Speaker 4>you've lost what's also dirty to name</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff after important values like the</v>

2818
01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:51.790
<v Speaker 4>Patriot Act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>

2819
01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:54.370
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you vote against the Patriot and</v>

2820
01:56:55.110 --> 01:56:56.580
<v Speaker 4>patriot?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Patriot.</v>

2821
01:56:56.581 --> 01:56:58.410
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's rude.</v>

2822
01:56:58.560 --> 01:56:59.790
<v Speaker 4>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's rude.</v>

2823
01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:00.960
<v Speaker 4>That's a root,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dirty trick.</v>

2824
01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:03.690
<v Speaker 4>Somebody should have pointed that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone David from,</v>

2825
01:57:03.691 --> 01:57:06.240
<v Speaker 4>they had any balls like there was on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Senate floor.</v>

2826
01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:09.090
<v Speaker 4>David from editing and in a book called</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't think of an elephant,</v>

2827
01:57:09.091 --> 01:57:10.380
<v Speaker 4>I think it was called.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What year was this?</v>

2828
01:57:10.381 --> 01:57:11.760
<v Speaker 4>When did I read that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A long time ago.</v>

2829
01:57:11.761 --> 01:57:14.220
<v Speaker 4>But he basically talks about how</v>
<v Speaker 4>language,</v>

2830
01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:17.670
<v Speaker 4>if you learn,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you learn how to manipulate language,</v>

2831
01:57:17.970 --> 01:57:19.850
<v Speaker 4>it is very beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2832
01:57:19.890 --> 01:57:21.030
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will.</v>

2833
01:57:21.300 --> 01:57:23.300
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read a um,</v>

2834
01:57:23.810 --> 01:57:26.160
<v Speaker 4>it's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting things about like our</v>

2835
01:57:26.161 --> 01:57:26.670
<v Speaker 4>population.</v>

2836
01:57:26.670 --> 01:57:30.180
<v Speaker 4>Do you know that 80,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's 82% of Americans can't name</v>

2837
01:57:30.181 --> 01:57:35.181
<v Speaker 4>one living scientist yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you ask 82% of Americans will say</v>

2838
01:57:36.211 --> 01:57:41.211
<v Speaker 4>that politicians should be talking to</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientists even though they don't,</v>

2839
01:57:41.851 --> 01:57:45.300
<v Speaker 4>they can't name one living scientists</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Neil degrasse Tyson or Stephen</v>

2840
01:57:45.301 --> 01:57:49.290
<v Speaker 4>hawkings or Lawrence Krauss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the same time,</v>

2841
01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:53.040
<v Speaker 4>there is a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only mistrust but also respect for</v>

2842
01:57:53.041 --> 01:57:53.874
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

2843
01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:56.490
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you politicians listen to the fucking</v>

2844
01:57:56.491 --> 01:57:57.121
<v Speaker 4>size.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there's,</v>

2845
01:57:57.121 --> 01:57:59.760
<v Speaker 4>if there's a weapon out there that can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if there's a technology that can reduce</v>

2846
01:57:59.761 --> 01:58:01.950
<v Speaker 4>this all the dust,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen to those fucking guys.</v>

2847
01:58:01.951 --> 01:58:05.040
<v Speaker 4>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find it very interesting that science</v>

2848
01:58:05.041 --> 01:58:08.760
<v Speaker 4>is still being questioned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's real questions on the right</v>

2849
01:58:08.761 --> 01:58:12.990
<v Speaker 4>about the science behind climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you see what happened recently and</v>

2850
01:58:12.991 --> 01:58:15.870
<v Speaker 4>it was in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the recent rash of earthquakes.</v>

2851
01:58:15.871 --> 01:58:19.350
<v Speaker 4>I tweeted about it today directly</v>
<v Speaker 4>connected to fracking.</v>

2852
01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:23.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure 100% but it's also interesting</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that both sides of the left and</v>

2853
01:58:23.161 --> 01:58:24.330
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Speaking of tribalism,</v>

2854
01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:27.600
<v Speaker 4>the left doesn't want to hear anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the difference,</v>

2855
01:58:27.601 --> 01:58:30.060
<v Speaker 4>the scientific difference between men</v>
<v Speaker 4>and women.</v>

2856
01:58:30.510 --> 01:58:33.660
<v Speaker 4>That would be an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when you start talking about</v>

2857
01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:36.540
<v Speaker 4>trans women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the difference between male and</v>

2858
01:58:36.541 --> 01:58:40.860
<v Speaker 4>female brains because what happens if</v>
<v Speaker 4>your James Dannemora is that what you're</v>

2859
01:58:41.800 --> 01:58:42.100
<v Speaker 4>is</v>

2860
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:47.100
<v Speaker 1>that women are a victim to their biology</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ultimately are not able to overcome</v>

2861
01:58:49.091 --> 01:58:53.680
<v Speaker 1>certain things that men have inherently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James [inaudible] from the Google knows.</v>

2862
01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to as the Google memo guy.</v>

2863
01:58:57.450 --> 01:59:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah and I read that Google and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>about twice and what's interesting is a</v>

2864
01:59:00.161 --> 01:59:03.310
<v Speaker 1>lot of evolutionary psychologists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>biologists basically said,</v>

2865
01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:08.050
<v Speaker 1>well what he was saying was just drawing</v>
<v Speaker 1>on on empirical evidence based on how,</v>

2866
01:59:08.110 --> 01:59:11.170
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 48 year old,</v>

2867
01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:16.560
<v Speaker 1>a 48 month old infant female and a 48</v>
<v Speaker 1>month old male we'll look at too.</v>

2868
01:59:17.981 --> 01:59:21.580
<v Speaker 1>If you give them a choice between</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at something moving and a human</v>

2869
01:59:21.581 --> 01:59:25.120
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically the female to 48 hour old</v>

2870
01:59:25.121 --> 01:59:27.100
<v Speaker 1>female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll look at the face,</v>

2871
01:59:27.101 --> 01:59:30.070
<v Speaker 1>the human face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boy will look at the moving object.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this.</v>

2948
02:02:22.130 --> 02:02:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if people look like you ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at a person from like the 18</v>

2952
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:35.150
<v Speaker 1>They look so weathered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They looked like they were just dirt,</v>

2953
02:02:35.151 --> 02:02:37.430
<v Speaker 1>had been he Gary Fisher when they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>take pictures of with their dead</v>

<v Speaker 1>They looked like shit.</v>

2960
02:02:47.300 --> 02:02:49.310
<v Speaker 1>What if you lived 800 years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think about.</v>

2961
02:02:49.670 --> 02:02:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about developing that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>

2962
02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2966
02:03:03.830 --> 02:03:08.210
<v Speaker 1>or 800 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be living in a castle and you</v>

2967
02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:12.680
<v Speaker 1>would basically be having young ladies</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to the council and give them</v>

2968
02:03:12.681 --> 02:03:14.220

3011
02:05:00.181 --> 02:05:02.250
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to learn for someone as by</v>

3012
02:05:02.251 --> 02:05:06.660
<v Speaker 3>someone out there like following a lead</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know is difficult and achieving</v>

3013
02:05:06.661 --> 02:05:10.290
<v Speaker 3>teams that you think are very hard to</v>
<v Speaker 3>achieve and you watch that and you go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You gotta be honest.</v>

3018
02:05:16.231 --> 02:05:18.780
<v Speaker 3>You can't go to be honest with yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how hard you're working.</v>

3019
02:05:18.781 --> 02:05:20.340
<v Speaker 3>And that's what a lot of people are not</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3085
02:07:44.591 --> 02:07:46.120
<v Speaker 3>this is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

3086
02:07:46.150 --> 02:07:48.090
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a huge accomplishments.</v>

3087
02:07:48.091 --> 02:07:50.770
<v Speaker 3>Z,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a crazy number of people that follow his</v>

3088
02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:52.340
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He is right about his conspiracy</v>

3089
02:07:52.350 --> 02:07:54.640
<v Speaker 3>theories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's definitely right about Jujitsu.</v>

3090
02:07:55.240 --> 02:07:56.890
<v Speaker 3>You know the chemistry of things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another one,</v>

3091
02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:58.990
<v Speaker 3>like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he claimed that for a long time.</v>

3092
02:07:58.991 --> 02:08:00.880
<v Speaker 3>He still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll put something up on his instagram</v>

3093
02:08:00.881 --> 02:08:02.650
<v Speaker 3>page.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know why he believes that because he</v>

3094
02:08:02.651 --> 02:08:07.120
<v Speaker 3>doesn't believe in the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my position is I get that and I</v>

3095
02:08:07.121 --> 02:08:09.520
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't trust a lot of people either,</v>

3096
02:08:09.730 --> 02:08:13.330
<v Speaker 3>but you have to trust the people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are scientists that are all agreeing</v>

3097
02:08:13.331 --> 02:08:17.140
<v Speaker 3>that if a fucking jet engine that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>heated up goes through condensation and</v>

3098
02:08:17.141 --> 02:08:20.560
<v Speaker 3>a certain atmosphere that creates</v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial cloud being responsive to</v>

3099
02:08:20.561 --> 02:08:21.394
<v Speaker 3>evidence.</v>

3100
02:08:21.610 --> 02:08:23.260
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also like you,</v>

3101
02:08:23.261 --> 02:08:24.520
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

3102
02:08:25.090 --> 02:08:28.480
<v Speaker 3>you can't mock that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's very important if you're going</v>

3103
02:08:28.481 --> 02:08:31.060
<v Speaker 3>to get anywhere with any of their stance</v>
<v Speaker 3>on your wrist and in your hand,</v>

3104
02:08:31.270 --> 02:08:33.130
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're listening to it like this,</v>

3105
02:08:33.131 --> 02:08:35.800
<v Speaker 3>this is their science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that measurable science that works,</v>

3106
02:08:35.801 --> 02:08:37.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the science that goes into your</v>

3107
02:08:37.660 --> 02:08:41.030
<v Speaker 3>earphones that goes into the vaccines</v>
<v Speaker 3>and antibiotics,</v>

3108
02:08:41.031 --> 02:08:44.440
<v Speaker 3>I push you beyond your black biology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the science that gets food,</v>

3109
02:08:44.441 --> 02:08:46.930
<v Speaker 3>fresh food in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that shit is,</v>

3110
02:08:46.990 --> 02:08:51.430
<v Speaker 3>is you're benefiting from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And usually the science that you don't</v>

3111
02:08:51.431 --> 02:08:55.990
<v Speaker 3>believe in is the same science you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually using to speak into.</v>

3112
02:08:56.140 --> 02:08:57.250
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3113
02:08:57.310 --> 02:08:59.710
<v Speaker 3>that's the argument we were having</v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday that it's,</v>

3114
02:08:59.711 --> 02:09:04.360
<v Speaker 3>it's so ridiculous that anybody would</v>
<v Speaker 3>have an issue with the highest minds in</v>

3115
02:09:04.361 --> 02:09:08.230
<v Speaker 3>the world deciding whether or not things</v>
<v Speaker 3>are real and things are not real and</v>

3116
02:09:08.231 --> 02:09:09.280
<v Speaker 3>what is and what isn't.</v>

3117
02:09:09.340 --> 02:09:11.890
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he thinks that's really weird.</v>

3118
02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:14.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he believes we could</v>
<v Speaker 3>sit him down and talk to them about it,</v>

3119
02:09:14.831 --> 02:09:19.831
<v Speaker 3>but my point about all of it was that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the very genius that allows him to like</v>

3120
02:09:20.801 --> 02:09:24.040
<v Speaker 3>shut down Jujitsu attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he doesn't recognize Jujitsu</v>

3121
02:09:24.041 --> 02:09:24.731
<v Speaker 3>attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3122
02:09:24.731 --> 02:09:26.350
<v Speaker 3>well this is valid too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3123
02:09:26.351 --> 02:09:28.960
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shut that shit down and move forward.</v>

3124
02:09:28.970 --> 02:09:31.030
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the reasons why he's so good</v>
<v Speaker 3>at Jujitsu.</v>

3125
02:09:31.450 --> 02:09:35.800
<v Speaker 3>He's so good at Jujitsu cause he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>like recognize your attack is valid.</v>

3126
02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:37.810
<v Speaker 3>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shut shit down and it moves.</v>

3127
02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:41.170
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting as well because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an undeniable,</v>

3128
02:09:41.171 --> 02:09:43.600
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Bravo is an undeniable jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 3>genius.</v>

3129
02:09:43.690 --> 02:09:45.070
<v Speaker 3>I haven't sound to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

3130
02:09:45.071 --> 02:09:46.570
<v Speaker 3>I've been salivary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3131
02:09:46.660 --> 02:09:47.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's great salivary.</v>

3132
02:09:48.610 --> 02:09:50.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have some reason to shout out to Ivan.</v>

3133
02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:53.560
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went and he gave me a lesson and if so</v>

3134
02:09:53.561 --> 02:09:54.030
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>

3135
02:09:54.030 --> 02:09:56.260
<v Speaker 3>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to Seattle and the school,</v>

3136
02:09:56.380 --> 02:09:58.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the only guy in the UFC that has a</v>

3137
02:09:58.331 --> 02:10:00.370
<v Speaker 3>submission.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe one of the person might</v>

3138
02:10:00.371 --> 02:10:02.500
<v Speaker 3>have it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the longest time he was the only</v>

3139
02:10:02.501 --> 02:10:06.880
<v Speaker 3>guy that had a body triangle rear mount</v>
<v Speaker 3>submission where he got a guide.</v>

3140
02:10:06.910 --> 02:10:09.640
<v Speaker 3>He got Tony Fryklund in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got his back.</v>

3141
02:10:09.870 --> 02:10:13.060
<v Speaker 3>And when you flatten somebody out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have someone in a body triangle,</v>

3142
02:10:13.090 --> 02:10:16.390
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so fucking brutally painful.</v>

3143
02:10:16.420 --> 02:10:17.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That um,</v>

3144
02:10:17.770 --> 02:10:20.830
<v Speaker 3>Tony frequent tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the first guy ever to tap from a</v>

3145
02:10:20.831 --> 02:10:23.500
<v Speaker 3>body triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember I've watched him do that</v>

3146
02:10:23.501 --> 02:10:25.360
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh wow.</v>

3147
02:10:25.361 --> 02:10:28.240
<v Speaker 3>Cause I knew that that hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know if someone would tap</v>

3148
02:10:28.241 --> 02:10:30.180
<v Speaker 3>from it in a UFC fight as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

3149
02:10:30.190 --> 02:10:32.920
<v Speaker 3>For a guy like me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's probably 43 44 now.</v>

3150
02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:37.180
<v Speaker 3>And he said he invited me to school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just so excited and he's going to</v>

3151
02:10:37.181 --> 02:10:39.200
<v Speaker 3>teach me tricks and just like in close</v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting,</v>

3152
02:10:39.201 --> 02:10:40.160
<v Speaker 3>Bach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dirty boxing.</v>

3153
02:10:40.550 --> 02:10:41.211
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we put,</v>

3154
02:10:41.211 --> 02:10:43.040
<v Speaker 3>he put vaseline on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3155
02:10:43.041 --> 02:10:44.060
<v Speaker 3>what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3156
02:10:44.090 --> 02:10:48.670
<v Speaker 3>See he gets a body triangle last cross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tap and fucking the pocock.</v>

3157
02:10:48.770 --> 02:10:50.840
<v Speaker 3>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so painful.</v>

3158
02:10:50.841 --> 02:10:52.340
<v Speaker 3>He's such a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at him.</v>

3159
02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:53.860
<v Speaker 3>He's from Chile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3160
02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:56.000
<v Speaker 3>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's got a rooster tattooed on his</v>

3161
02:10:56.001 --> 02:10:56.700
<v Speaker 3>wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does it.</v>

3162
02:10:56.700 --> 02:10:59.370
<v Speaker 3>And it was funny because he came to my</v>
<v Speaker 3>show and then I,</v>

3163
02:10:59.430 --> 02:11:00.860
<v Speaker 3>the next day I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

3164
02:11:00.990 --> 02:11:04.190
<v Speaker 3>I got an a ring with him and he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he put greets salmon and we're just</v>

3165
02:11:04.191 --> 02:11:06.530
<v Speaker 3>doing little things with gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you,</v>

3166
02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:10.760
<v Speaker 3>it's for a man like me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a man like me who's basically 170</v>

3167
02:11:10.761 --> 02:11:12.810
<v Speaker 3>pounds and nothing come back.</v>

3168
02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:17.750
<v Speaker 3>And when you feel that a man who's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>thrown bodies around his whole life and</v>

3169
02:11:17.751 --> 02:11:19.670
<v Speaker 3>punching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's been his life and he's,</v>

3170
02:11:19.730 --> 02:11:21.710
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's probably about to 20 maybe to 30</v>

3171
02:11:22.070 --> 02:11:24.230
<v Speaker 3>and he acts a little heavier than when</v>
<v Speaker 3>he used to fight.</v>

3172
02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:28.820
<v Speaker 3>But the strength and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just the density of his body as you're</v>

3173
02:11:28.821 --> 02:11:31.550
<v Speaker 3>fucking trying to do anything and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>just moves you.</v>

3174
02:11:31.610 --> 02:11:34.220
<v Speaker 3>He kind of shocks you around with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>script writer.</v>

3175
02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:37.700
<v Speaker 3>It's so humbling and he's super</v>
<v Speaker 3>technical to Oh fuck.</v>

3176
02:11:37.710 --> 02:11:39.550
<v Speaker 3>He so to Ivan was like super,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super.</v>

3177
02:11:39.990 --> 02:11:41.870
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did I take a picture of him and was</v>

3178
02:11:41.871 --> 02:11:44.690
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a picture of him and Maury Smith</v>

<v Speaker 3>Charlie Murphy is explaining something</v>
<v Speaker 3>called the Chicago Ridge hand.</v>

3181
02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:54.500
<v Speaker 3>That's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a technique karate technique that people</v>

3182
02:11:54.501 --> 02:11:56.900
<v Speaker 3>aren't using enough in mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's kind of right.</v>

3183
02:11:57.140 --> 02:12:00.260
<v Speaker 3>It's a rich hand is where you had hit</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone with a side of your hand.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's like this.</v>

3187
02:12:06.771 --> 02:12:09.680
<v Speaker 3>This is Eddie Murphy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's Ivan salivary to the right of the</v>

3188
02:12:09.681 --> 02:12:12.230

<v Speaker 3>Really good to understand how funny</v>

3197
02:12:36.261 --> 02:12:38.720
<v Speaker 3>Charlie was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard is a great storyteller is</v>

3198
02:12:38.721 --> 02:12:42.020
<v Speaker 3>amazing storyteller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he just would hold court and you</v>

3199
02:12:42.021 --> 02:12:43.940
<v Speaker 3>would let them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would fall to the ground laughing.</v>

3200
02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:48.170
<v Speaker 3>He was just a great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was great at like being the guy who</v>

3201
02:12:48.171 --> 02:12:53.171
<v Speaker 3>told the story the best and it had the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't translate in a stand up as</v>

3202
02:12:53.961 --> 02:12:56.360
<v Speaker 3>much as it should have been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I think happened.</v>

3203
02:12:56.660 --> 02:12:59.420
<v Speaker 3>I think he jumped into standup like way</v>
<v Speaker 3>too quick.</v>

3204
02:12:59.421 --> 02:13:03.530
<v Speaker 3>It was headlining like really early.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he didn't do like the whole thing</v>

3205
02:13:03.531 --> 02:13:07.640
<v Speaker 3>like we all did like do the open mic</v>
<v Speaker 3>night and then start doing no dude,</v>

3206
02:13:07.641 --> 02:13:11.750
<v Speaker 3>he was headlining like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was charlie my from the Chappelle</v>

3207
02:13:11.751 --> 02:13:16.240
<v Speaker 3>show him done standard before that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>had never done standup,</v>

3208
02:13:16.250 --> 02:13:18.970
<v Speaker 3>can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he figured out how to weight it.</v>

3209
02:13:18.980 --> 02:13:20.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did it and he figured out,</v>

3210
02:13:20.541 --> 02:13:23.870
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think he ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you had allowed Charlie</v>

3211
02:13:23.870 --> 02:13:25.630
<v Speaker 3>Murphy develop the way we all did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3212
02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:29.180
<v Speaker 3>From Open Miker to Middle Act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a headliner to holt,</v>

3213
02:13:29.420 --> 02:13:32.850
<v Speaker 3>he would have been a world class</v>
<v Speaker 3>assassin.</v>

3214
02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:35.820
<v Speaker 1>And he know he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still a very funny comedian and he</v>

3215
02:13:35.821 --> 02:13:38.490
<v Speaker 1>was headlining all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know he was sick when you were</v>

3216
02:13:38.491 --> 02:13:39.420
<v Speaker 1>hanging up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3217
02:13:39.421 --> 02:13:42.880
<v Speaker 1>he was in sick when I was hanging out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with leukemia or some kind of a stretch.</v>

3218
02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:45.540
<v Speaker 1>But that all happened after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3219
02:13:46.290 --> 02:13:48.450
<v Speaker 1>after I'd seen him,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the problem with keeping it real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3447
02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:16.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to keep it real and hanging</v>

3448
02:22:16.181 --> 02:22:18.710
<v Speaker 1>with the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually someone's going to test you.</v>

3449
02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Someone like you were when you were 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3450
02:22:21.111 --> 02:22:21.790
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

3451
02:22:21.790 --> 02:22:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno if conner was into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I assume he wasn't because he's a</v>

3452
02:22:25.831 --> 02:22:26.370
<v Speaker 1>winner,</v>

3453
02:22:26.370 --> 02:22:29.070
<v Speaker 7>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that absolutely can happen if you want</v>

3454
02:22:29.071 --> 02:22:31.470
<v Speaker 7>to be out there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Again,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I mean he's,</v>

3457
02:22:36.330 --> 02:22:39.510
<v Speaker 7>he's walking around with expensive</v>
<v Speaker 7>watches,</v>

3458
02:22:39.690 --> 02:22:42.000
<v Speaker 7>these beautiful David August suits on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He wears,</v>

3459
02:22:42.001 --> 02:22:45.390
<v Speaker 7>he's tailored suits everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Here's the super expensive shoes and</v>

3460
02:22:45.391 --> 02:22:49.230
<v Speaker 7>watches and many of their lambos are</v>
<v Speaker 7>driving around Ireland to a lot.</v>

3461
02:22:49.440 --> 02:22:50.310
<v Speaker 7>That's great point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

02:22:52.860 --> 02:22:54.030
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's balling out of control.</v>

3464
02:22:54.390 --> 02:22:57.720
<v Speaker 7>I wonder what it would take him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean now that he had that big crazy</v>

3465
02:22:57.721 --> 02:23:02.721
<v Speaker 7>fight at the fight and when he jumped</v>
<v Speaker 7>over the fence and pushed referee Mark</v>

3466
02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:05.580
<v Speaker 7>Goddard,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wonder what it would take to get him</v>

3467
02:23:05.581 --> 02:23:07.980
<v Speaker 7>back in the cage now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like one of it's going to be fines and</v>

3468
02:23:07.981 --> 02:23:09.750
<v Speaker 7>suspensions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I wonder what the fuck is going to</v>

3469
02:23:09.751 --> 02:23:11.460
<v Speaker 7>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's quite fascinating,</v>

3470
02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:12.840
<v Speaker 7>but I'll tell you one thing.</v>

3471
02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:15.330
<v Speaker 7>He makes things fun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He does.</v>

3472
02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:17.790
<v Speaker 7>It makes things fun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>With Oscar de la Hoya is hitting the</v>

3473
02:23:17.791 --> 02:23:20.370
<v Speaker 7>heavy bag on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He should say that he'll fight Oscar de</v>

3474
02:23:20.370 --> 02:23:21.960
<v Speaker 7>la Hoya,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but only if Oscar agrees to wear a</v>

3475
02:23:21.961 --> 02:23:24.080
<v Speaker 7>skirt.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You got to wear a skirt and you've got</v>

3476
02:23:24.081 --> 02:23:25.890
<v Speaker 7>to wear fishnet stockings and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking fight.</v>

3477
02:23:25.891 --> 02:23:28.590
<v Speaker 7>You think there's anything still too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've heard Roy Jones is still trying to</v>

3478

<v Speaker 7>Let me just preface that.</v>

3497
02:24:10.080 --> 02:24:12.150
<v Speaker 7>If he indeed is guilty and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they,</v>

<v Speaker 7>mcgregor?</v>

<v Speaker 7>Sure.</v>

3502
02:24:18.900 --> 02:24:23.900
<v Speaker 1>The fight Manny Pacquiao or tiny tube</v>
<v Speaker 1>made of gold can feel it with diamonds.</v>

3505
02:24:29.160 --> 02:24:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Image oxide.</v>

3506
02:24:30.211 --> 02:24:35.160
<v Speaker 1>We fucking drank and had we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during constraint the Tardis whiskey,</v>

3507
02:24:35.730 --> 02:24:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I drink a fucking gun barrel full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Viagra,</v>

3508
02:24:39.130 --> 02:24:42.870
<v Speaker 1>gone barrel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make my way to the pool and just started</v>

3509
02:24:42.871 --> 02:24:47.870
<v Speaker 1>shooting rounds off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a bad or good,</v>

3510
02:24:47.970 --> 02:24:48.803
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good time,</v>

3511
02:24:49.240 --> 02:24:51.040
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>iconic mcgregor accent.</v>

3512
02:24:51.041 --> 02:24:54.010
<v Speaker 7>But is it good or lucky charms?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would hire the most beautiful,</v>

3513
02:24:54.011 --> 02:24:57.190
<v Speaker 7>huge volleyball player,</v>
<v Speaker 7>women to just carry me everywhere.</v>

3514
02:24:57.540 --> 02:24:58.390
<v Speaker 7>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3515
02:24:58.391 --> 02:25:03.100
<v Speaker 7>Just to get giant super athlete women</v>
<v Speaker 7>and just carry you everywhere.</v>

3516
02:25:03.130 --> 02:25:05.550
<v Speaker 7>Do you think he fights Tony Ferguson or</v>
<v Speaker 7>does he fight?</v>

3517
02:25:05.590 --> 02:25:07.480
<v Speaker 7>That's the Moon Manny Pacquiao.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He used to be,</v>

3518
02:25:07.481 --> 02:25:09.250
<v Speaker 7>not the move,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I think Tony Ferguson,</v>

3519
02:25:09.310 --> 02:25:12.490
<v Speaker 7>like I think Eddie Bravo had a real good</v>
<v Speaker 7>point about it when he and me and</v>

3520
02:25:12.491 --> 02:25:14.980
<v Speaker 7>Brendan talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think Tony Ferguson,</v>

3521
02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.280
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is the right move as far as for the</v>

3522
02:25:17.290 --> 02:25:18.550
<v Speaker 7>fans.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>

3523
02:25:18.551 --> 02:25:19.480
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>over many.</v>

3524
02:25:19.870 --> 02:25:21.580
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think that's smart.</v>

3525
02:25:21.581 --> 02:25:22.990
<v Speaker 7>I think if he wants to do a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3526
02:25:23.200 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 7>a boxing match,</v>

3527
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:26.260
<v Speaker 3>the real smart move,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be fun an mma fight and then fight a</v>

3528
02:25:26.261 --> 02:25:28.150
<v Speaker 3>boxing match in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3529
02:25:28.151 --> 02:25:29.320
<v Speaker 3>but I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3530
02:25:30.050 --> 02:25:31.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Habib Nambucca madoff fight,</v>

3531
02:25:31.751 --> 02:25:35.080
<v Speaker 3>you've really got to see he'll be fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody else first and the nate diaz</v>

3532
02:25:35.081 --> 02:25:37.630
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although it could be huge.</v>

3533
02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Nate's not really fighting anybody right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

3534
02:25:39.970 --> 02:25:41.770
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I would like right now,</v>

3535
02:25:41.771 --> 02:25:43.090
<v Speaker 3>this is my thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think nate,</v>

3536
02:25:43.091 --> 02:25:46.360
<v Speaker 3>if nate comes back at fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone who wins conor fight someone and</v>

3537
02:25:46.361 --> 02:25:48.130
<v Speaker 3>wins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Connor is a boxing match.</v>

3538
02:25:48.131 --> 02:25:51.530
<v Speaker 3>They have a huge mma fight after that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking huge,</v>

3539
02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:55.750
<v Speaker 3>goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean 3 million pay per view buys huge,</v>

3540
02:25:55.751 --> 02:25:58.510
<v Speaker 3>gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a ton of conor mcgregor.</v>

3541
02:25:58.520 --> 02:25:59.800
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the fight.</v>

3542
02:25:59.801 --> 02:26:00.634
<v Speaker 3>It's going to get through it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3543
02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:04.120
<v Speaker 3>but that's a big fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might not even have to get through</v>

3544
02:26:04.121 --> 02:26:09.121
<v Speaker 3>that if he can lose but lose in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>respectable manner,</v>

3545
02:26:09.430 --> 02:26:13.780
<v Speaker 3>like lose a very close five round</v>
<v Speaker 3>decision where it's like a nail biter</v>

3546
02:26:13.930 --> 02:26:16.930
<v Speaker 3>where at the end of the rank and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

3547
02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:20.110
<v Speaker 3>and then Tony Ferguson drops the ground</v>
<v Speaker 3>and was like fuck.</v>

3548
02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:23.890
<v Speaker 3>And then there's like controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought conor won and the people that</v>

3549
02:26:23.891 --> 02:26:27.430
<v Speaker 3>the pundents we'll debate it online if</v>
<v Speaker 3>he can lose a fight like that.</v>

3550
02:26:27.550 --> 02:26:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if Tony Lights him up,</v>

3551
02:26:29.591 --> 02:26:33.520
<v Speaker 3>crack some darce choke some puts them</v>
<v Speaker 3>out in the first round and then spits on</v>

3552
02:26:33.521 --> 02:26:35.740
<v Speaker 3>his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3553
02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:37.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the nate diaz fight isn't worth a</v>

3554
02:26:37.841 --> 02:26:38.674
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>cause I said that Brendan,</v>

3574

<v Speaker 3>ever been.</v>

3599
02:28:11.621 --> 02:28:16.240
<v Speaker 3>Any time close to a fight and that he'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>have way less problem making weight for</v>

3600
02:28:16.241 --> 02:28:18.670
<v Speaker 3>this fight and they've got them on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>very strict nutrition schedule now</v>

3601
02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:22.010

02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:24.130
<v Speaker 7>My coworker Tammy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for me,</v>

3603
02:28:24.140 --> 02:28:28.640
<v Speaker 7>I tells me I'm sure much rockhold luke</v>
<v Speaker 7>walks around at two 15 you know,</v>

3604
02:28:29.540 --> 02:28:33.080
<v Speaker 7>I've listened to him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't make near megabit off bigger.</v>

3605
02:28:33.081 --> 02:28:34.070
<v Speaker 7>You understand how that works,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

3606
02:28:34.071 --> 02:28:35.210
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

3607
02:28:35.211 --> 02:28:40.130
<v Speaker 7>it never like he looks at Luke posted a</v>
<v Speaker 7>picture of him training with Khabib and</v>

3608
02:28:40.131 --> 02:28:41.690
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>who's the giant?</v>

3609
02:28:41.691 --> 02:28:44.450
<v Speaker 7>And it was done.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like he's one of the most impressive</v>

3610
02:28:44.451 --> 02:28:46.970
<v Speaker 7>grapplers I've ever seen in MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3611
02:28:47.150 --> 02:28:50.000
<v Speaker 7>It's ability to take guys who are very</v>
<v Speaker 7>good,</v>

3612
02:28:50.390 --> 02:28:52.150
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like Javiel dos Anjos and just sorta</v>

3613
02:28:52.160 --> 02:28:55.220
<v Speaker 7>ragdoll of wow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's his wrestling is.</v>

3614
02:28:55.550 --> 02:28:56.720
<v Speaker 7>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It is.</v>

3615
02:28:56.721 --> 02:28:57.620
<v Speaker 7>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's stunning.</v>

3616
02:28:57.770 --> 02:29:01.100
<v Speaker 7>It's a different kind of Russ because I</v>
<v Speaker 7>think dos Anjos is better now than he</v>

3617
02:29:01.101 --> 02:29:03.050
<v Speaker 7>was during that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it doesn't matter.</v>

3618
02:29:03.051 --> 02:29:03.381
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

3619
02:29:03.381 --> 02:29:04.520
<v Speaker 7>the way he did it to him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>

3620
02:29:04.521 --> 02:29:09.500
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if there's levels where it's hard to</v>

3621
02:29:09.501 --> 02:29:11.510
<v Speaker 7>tell with them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it may because strikings and fault when</v>

3622
02:29:11.570 --> 02:29:15.050
<v Speaker 7>strikings involved the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't get to see the pure grappling</v>

3623
02:29:15.051 --> 02:29:15.650
<v Speaker 7>level.</v>

3624
02:29:15.650 --> 02:29:18.170
<v Speaker 7>But what I was seeing when I was seeing</v>
<v Speaker 7>just pure,</v>

3625
02:29:18.171 --> 02:29:21.650
<v Speaker 7>just pure grappling,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would see in strength endurance</v>

3626
02:29:21.651 --> 02:29:25.190
<v Speaker 7>technique there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was just like 30% like they're</v>

3627
02:29:25.191 --> 02:29:27.860
<v Speaker 7>stacked up on number grammatical.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She gets a hold of you.</v>

3628
02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:29.420
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're not getting him off.</v>

3629
02:29:29.421 --> 02:29:32.060
<v Speaker 7>He got Mowgli Javery yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nobody gets him off.</v>

3630
02:29:32.061 --> 02:29:33.320
<v Speaker 7>Look at the size of it could be a</v>
<v Speaker 7>breath.</v>

3631
02:29:33.340 --> 02:29:35.300
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But now I might be the camera angled,</v>

3632
02:29:35.301 --> 02:29:36.800
<v Speaker 7>but it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he's,</v>

3633
02:29:36.801 --> 02:29:38.150
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's in front and,</v>

3634
02:29:38.151 --> 02:29:38.811
<v Speaker 7>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3635
02:29:38.811 --> 02:29:40.420
<v Speaker 7>he's not cutting weight right there or</v>

<v Speaker 7>if he is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's,</v>

3637
02:29:41.271 --> 02:29:43.040
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>halfway into the game.</v>

3654
02:30:18.651 --> 02:30:22.580
<v Speaker 7>they were trying to get him to confess.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But the point is this is a UFC number</v>

3655
02:30:22.581 --> 02:30:25.040
<v Speaker 7>one contender,</v>

3662
02:30:37.940 --> 02:30:38.820
<v Speaker 7>literally fighting.</v>

3663
02:30:38.960 --> 02:30:41.180
<v Speaker 7>He calls himself the Eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's like a fucking eagle.</v>

02:30:41.181 --> 02:30:44.330
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean he's fucking for Roche's when he</v>

3665
02:30:44.331 --> 02:30:47.330
<v Speaker 7>gets in there and he's at a level of</v>
<v Speaker 7>grappling,</v>

3666
02:30:47.331 --> 02:30:47.781
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

02:30:47.781 --> 02:30:52.781
<v Speaker 7>he's been doing it his whole like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And at an intense super primal level,</v>

3668
02:30:54.320 --> 02:30:55.280
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so intense,</v>

3669
02:30:55.281 --> 02:30:58.430
<v Speaker 7>real technical,</v>
<v Speaker 7>super knowledgeable about wrestling and</v>

3670
02:30:58.431 --> 02:31:02.100
<v Speaker 7>Jujitsu and submissions.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think Daniel said that they liked,</v>

3671
02:31:02.110 --> 02:31:06.770
<v Speaker 7>they basically tussled for 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Damn Daniel the Olympian.</v>

3672
02:31:07.090 --> 02:31:08.410
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he said it was hand fighting with them.</v>

3673
02:31:08.420 --> 02:31:10.940
<v Speaker 7>He like Whoa Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like he's a beast,</v>

3674
02:31:11.240 --> 02:31:14.000
<v Speaker 7>never coming off as a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And when you see him get a guy like</v>

3675
02:31:14.001 --> 02:31:16.310
<v Speaker 7>Michael Johnson down in the ground and</v>
<v Speaker 7>just own him,</v>

3676
02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:18.350
<v Speaker 7>he owned and he was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>look,</v>

3677
02:31:18.351 --> 02:31:20.190
<v Speaker 7>I'm sorry I gotta do this to you man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but you gotta tap</v>

3678
02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:20.641
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3679
02:31:20.641 --> 02:31:23.520
<v Speaker 3>I need my title shot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody saying guys beating the fuck out</v>

3680
02:31:23.521 --> 02:31:24.150
<v Speaker 3>of him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3681
02:31:24.150 --> 02:31:25.990
<v Speaker 3>He was just holding him down and</v>
<v Speaker 3>pounding on him.</v>

3682
02:31:25.991 --> 02:31:28.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really hard for me to watch cause</v>

3683
02:31:28.110 --> 02:31:31.230
<v Speaker 3>one thing I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm impressed with Michael Johnson's</v>

3684
02:31:32.010 --> 02:31:35.670
<v Speaker 3>complete unwillingness to tap just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just like beat me up,</v>

3685
02:31:35.671 --> 02:31:37.770
<v Speaker 3>keep beating me up cause we're fighting</v>
<v Speaker 3>through it.</v>

3686
02:31:38.100 --> 02:31:41.640
<v Speaker 3>And then he eventually got Kimora but it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was just ruthless man.</v>

3687
02:31:41.641 --> 02:31:44.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was ruthless and the control that he</v>

3688
02:31:44.281 --> 02:31:47.100
<v Speaker 3>had on him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just his arm tied up and just beating</v>

3689
02:31:47.101 --> 02:31:48.180
<v Speaker 3>the shit out of all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3690
02:31:48.210 --> 02:31:49.830
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3691
02:31:50.020 --> 02:31:51.630
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's certain positions where you see</v>

3692
02:31:51.631 --> 02:31:54.750
<v Speaker 3>a guy so much better at a god that he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not done and then a guy that,</v>

3693
02:31:54.751 --> 02:31:56.310
<v Speaker 3>the guy who's holding down just not</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get up.</v>

3694
02:31:56.570 --> 02:31:59.070
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to get up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So matter of time before he gets beaten</v>

3695
02:31:59.071 --> 02:32:00.060
<v Speaker 3>into unconsciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He just clamps down on his wrist and his</v>

3701
02:32:11.971 --> 02:32:15.260
<v Speaker 3>right arm became,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he became a one arm defensive guys.</v>

3777
02:35:02.830 --> 02:35:04.930
<v Speaker 1>He had a twin brother or am I thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Matt Hughes?</v>

3778
02:35:04.970 --> 02:35:09.420
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking of Matt Hughes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure to have a twin brother too?</v>

3779
02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Might as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3780
02:35:10.550 --> 02:35:11.650
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and but uh,</v>

3781
02:35:11.710 --> 02:35:12.940
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

3782
02:35:12.970 --> 02:35:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why was Matt Hughes Doing,</v>

3783
02:35:15.251 --> 02:35:16.540
<v Speaker 1>do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing better?</v>

3784
02:35:16.541 --> 02:35:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they're really excited about</v>
<v Speaker 1>his progress.</v>

3785
02:35:19.121 --> 02:35:21.180
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in a coma for quite a while from</v>

3786
02:35:21.181 --> 02:35:23.050
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently what they're saying is that</v>

3787
02:35:23.051 --> 02:35:26.440
<v Speaker 1>he thought that he could make it across</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tracks and then if you waited,</v>

3788
02:35:26.441 --> 02:35:28.780
<v Speaker 1>the train takes like 10 minutes to go or</v>
<v Speaker 1>tearing or attendance,</v>

3789
02:35:28.830 --> 02:35:31.270
<v Speaker 1>fucking giant ass train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he took a chance and he hit some</v>

3790
02:35:31.271 --> 02:35:34.300
<v Speaker 1>gravel and he was able to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked with them on warrior and you</v>

3791
02:35:34.301 --> 02:35:35.560
<v Speaker 1>know what he said to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he goes,</v>

3792
02:35:35.561 --> 02:35:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I just hope I can put my shoes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put my own shoes.</v>

3793
02:35:38.771 --> 02:35:40.720
<v Speaker 1>I when I'm 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can like he cause he,</v>

3794
02:35:40.721 --> 02:35:41.770
<v Speaker 1>he worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about head,</v>

3795
02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:42.350
<v Speaker 1>head trauma.</v>

3796
02:35:42.350 --> 02:35:45.490
<v Speaker 1>He worries about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says about all should he should,</v>

3797
02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:47.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and towards the end of his career he</v>

3798
02:35:47.381 --> 02:35:48.880
<v Speaker 1>developed a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3799
02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:52.870
<v Speaker 1>a compromise chin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best way to put it.</v>

3800
02:35:52.900 --> 02:35:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Like you could see like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>j pen,</v>

3801
02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:56.380
<v Speaker 1>brain shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does everybody,</v>

3802
02:35:56.381 --> 02:35:59.350
<v Speaker 1>does chuck the Dal who had the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably one of the greatest chins of</v>

3803
02:35:59.351 --> 02:36:01.480
<v Speaker 1>all time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he exhibited it later in his career.</v>

3804
02:36:01.481 --> 02:36:03.550
<v Speaker 1>He just couldn't take shots anymore</v>
<v Speaker 1>because your body goes,</v>

3805
02:36:03.551 --> 02:36:04.480
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been here before.</v>

3806
02:36:04.481 --> 02:36:06.220
<v Speaker 1>I see a letter and shuts down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3807
02:36:06.410 --> 02:36:11.410
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy who is just rock solid for Rosha</v>

3808
02:36:11.511 --> 02:36:14.050
<v Speaker 1>says Chuck Liddell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just a walkthrough bombs.</v>

3809
02:36:14.051 --> 02:36:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Guys are just throw bombs on him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd walk through them at the end of his</v>

3810
02:36:16.991 --> 02:36:18.190
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could not do that anymore.</v>

3811
02:36:18.610 --> 02:36:19.690
<v Speaker 1>So interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How your,</v>

3812
02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:22.660
<v Speaker 1>how a lactone of fighting makes you more</v>
<v Speaker 1>fragile,</v>

3813
02:36:22.850 --> 02:36:23.290
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3814
02:36:23.290 --> 02:36:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean your body's just not designed for</v>

3815
02:36:25.331 --> 02:36:28.720
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did an x ray of his face and he has a</v>

3816
02:36:28.721 --> 02:36:31.810
<v Speaker 1>micro fractures all through his face and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

3817
02:36:31.811 --> 02:36:34.330
<v Speaker 1>and the doctor said it's very common</v>
<v Speaker 1>with fighters and football players</v>

3818
02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:37.540
<v Speaker 1>choose corona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just micro just cracks all through your</v>

3819
02:36:37.541 --> 02:36:38.740
<v Speaker 1>math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3820
02:36:38.741 --> 02:36:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3821
02:36:39.760 --> 02:36:42.940
<v Speaker 1>You think about Brendan Spar and Shane</v>
<v Speaker 1>car when all the times getting mugged.</v>

3822
02:36:42.970 --> 02:36:47.110
<v Speaker 1>How about getting punched full on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>having his nose shattered by Cro cop?</v>

3823
02:36:47.140 --> 02:36:48.230
<v Speaker 1>It was an elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact.</v>

3824
02:36:48.270 --> 02:36:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And still coming back.</v>

3825
02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Lamb.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Took some good shots from a big country</v>

3827
02:36:55.151 --> 02:36:57.970
<v Speaker 1>before he got hit behind the ear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He watched that fight.</v>

3828
02:36:58.010 --> 02:36:58.631
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

3829
02:36:58.631 --> 02:37:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Ben Rothwell caled him</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Ben.</v>

3830
02:37:03.460 --> 02:37:05.050
<v Speaker 1>He's another guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what happened with him?</v>

3831
02:37:05.080 --> 02:37:06.730
<v Speaker 1>He got caught with something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3832
02:37:06.910 --> 02:37:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>does not have a twin brother.</v>

3834
02:37:10.510 --> 02:37:12.550

<v Speaker 1>That's her brothers.</v>

3837
02:37:15.710 --> 02:37:16.190
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

3838
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:18.140
<v Speaker 7>one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3839
02:37:18.230 --> 02:37:21.920
<v Speaker 7>I mean when you're talking about in</v>
<v Speaker 7>these,</v>

3840
02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.350
<v Speaker 7>the fucking athletes that we're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 7>with today,</v>

3841
02:37:24.980 --> 02:37:26.900
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he talking with like what they're</v>

3842
02:37:26.901 --> 02:37:29.300
<v Speaker 7>experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think with medical science,</v>

3843
02:37:30.110 --> 02:37:33.590
<v Speaker 7>I bet like in 50 60 years we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 7>be looking back and they're going to be</v>

3844
02:37:33.591 --> 02:37:34.640
<v Speaker 7>going,</v>
<v Speaker 7>God damn,</v>

3845
02:37:34.641 --> 02:37:36.110
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these people couldn't even take blah,</v>

3846
02:37:36.111 --> 02:37:38.240
<v Speaker 7>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>blah to fix their problem.</v>

3847
02:37:38.570 --> 02:37:40.070
<v Speaker 7>They couldn't even go to the blah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>blah,</v>

3848
02:37:40.071 --> 02:37:43.760
<v Speaker 7>blah machine to fix their brain and they</v>
<v Speaker 7>just had to have bad brains.</v>

3849
02:37:43.761 --> 02:37:43.960
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

3850
02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:46.620
<v Speaker 4>Remember what Robert Sapolsky said in</v>
<v Speaker 4>your podcast last time?</v>

3851
02:37:46.621 --> 02:37:47.670
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was amazing.</v>

3852
02:37:47.970 --> 02:37:48.721
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we learn more.</v>

3853
02:37:48.721 --> 02:37:49.640
<v Speaker 4>What do you think's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

3854
02:37:49.641 --> 02:37:51.390
<v Speaker 4>I think in like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30,</v>

3855
02:37:51.391 --> 02:37:52.180
<v Speaker 4>40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to go,</v>

3856
02:37:52.180 --> 02:37:54.780
<v Speaker 4>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the way we treated people who</v>

3857
02:37:54.781 --> 02:37:57.450
<v Speaker 4>killed and who did things that were</v>
<v Speaker 4>impulsive.</v>

3858
02:37:57.480 --> 02:37:59.970
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their brains were just fucked up and we</v>

3859
02:37:59.971 --> 02:38:01.160
<v Speaker 4>didn't know how to fix him well,</v>

3860
02:38:01.520 --> 02:38:03.370
<v Speaker 7>just that he,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

3861
02:38:03.500 --> 02:38:06.290
<v Speaker 7>he was not just talking about their</v>
<v Speaker 7>brains being fucked up.</v>

3862
02:38:06.291 --> 02:38:10.760
<v Speaker 7>He was saying that the idea of free will</v>
<v Speaker 7>is a ridiculous concept that's ingrained</v>

3863
02:38:10.761 --> 02:38:12.980
<v Speaker 7>in the psyche of the American people in</v>
<v Speaker 7>particular.</v>

3864
02:38:13.340 --> 02:38:14.650
<v Speaker 7>And that's a Christian idea.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

3865
02:38:14.750 --> 02:38:18.050
<v Speaker 7>But it's also that you as a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the way he looks at things,</v>

3866
02:38:18.051 --> 02:38:20.120
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's boiling things down to the fucking,</v>

3867
02:38:20.510 --> 02:38:22.130
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the very atomic level.</v>

3868
02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:26.390
<v Speaker 7>And he's essentially saying that your</v>
<v Speaker 7>behavior has been determined by your</v>

3869
02:38:26.391 --> 02:38:27.950
<v Speaker 7>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 7>by your genes,</v>

3870
02:38:27.951 --> 02:38:31.540
<v Speaker 7>by year.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The experiences that you've had by all</v>

3871
02:38:31.541 --> 02:38:31.730
<v Speaker 7>of this,</v>

3872
02:38:31.730 --> 02:38:35.030
<v Speaker 4>things that you've left frontal cortex</v>
<v Speaker 4>may not be as developed because you grew</v>

3873
02:38:35.031 --> 02:38:39.110
<v Speaker 4>up poor and under a lot of stress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you make impulsive decisions,</v>

3874
02:38:39.111 --> 02:38:42.230
<v Speaker 4>lack of nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got the guy who kidnapped bent girl</v>

3875
02:38:42.231 --> 02:38:44.930
<v Speaker 4>I was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The young girl had two kids with her</v>

3876
02:38:44.931 --> 02:38:48.620
<v Speaker 4>when she was 13 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His father said that he had a motor</v>

3877
02:38:48.660 --> 02:38:50.390
<v Speaker 4>cycle accident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a normal kid,</v>

3878
02:38:50.391 --> 02:38:52.340
<v Speaker 4>and then he had a motorcycle accident.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was never the same.</v>

3879
02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:53.990
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his whole personality,</v>

3880
02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:57.290
<v Speaker 4>just the kinison story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the kit and got hit by a truck.</v>

3881
02:38:57.440 --> 02:38:59.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kinison was one kid,</v>

3882
02:38:59.430 --> 02:39:01.220
<v Speaker 4>Sam kinison got hit by a truck and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

3883
02:39:01.250 --> 02:39:04.130
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

3884
02:39:05.090 --> 02:39:06.890
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That gut kicking over.</v>

3885
02:39:06.891 --> 02:39:08.390
<v Speaker 4>If you know what else changed your</v>
<v Speaker 4>personality,</v>

3886
02:39:08.391 --> 02:39:09.920
<v Speaker 4>they say sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is fascinating.</v>

3887
02:39:09.921 --> 02:39:12.750
<v Speaker 4>Jerking off in your own mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost almost.</v>

3888
02:39:13.340 --> 02:39:15.280
<v Speaker 4>That would be traumatic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Changes your personality.</v>

3889
02:39:15.281 --> 02:39:18.590
<v Speaker 4>It would be traumatic for a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does a little until you end up liking</v>

3890
02:39:18.591 --> 02:39:20.240
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here's what really changes.</v>

3891
02:39:20.540 --> 02:39:21.930
<v Speaker 4>You're having a heart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3892
02:39:22.100 --> 02:39:22.970
<v Speaker 4>operation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3893
02:39:22.971 --> 02:39:24.920
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now what was so weird though,</v>

3894
02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:28.370
<v Speaker 4>we'll see for an operation on your heart</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it changes your whole personality.</v>

3895
02:39:28.780 --> 02:39:32.080
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's one thing about that that Dr.</v>

3896
02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:32.291
<v Speaker 7>Mark Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

3897
02:39:32.291 --> 02:39:37.291
<v Speaker 7>Mark Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he actually did a paper on um,</v>

3898
02:39:37.890 --> 02:39:42.890
<v Speaker 7>post traumatic surgeries like open heart</v>
<v Speaker 7>surgeries and the effect it has on</v>

3899
02:39:43.751 --> 02:39:48.751
<v Speaker 7>depression and perhaps suppression of</v>
<v Speaker 7>your body's ability to produce hormones.</v>

3900
02:39:49.590 --> 02:39:54.310
<v Speaker 7>There's something about being under</v>
<v Speaker 7>anesthesia for long periods of time with</v>

3901
02:39:54.311 --> 02:39:57.490
<v Speaker 7>very complicated operations.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It leaves people uniquely depressed</v>

3902
02:39:57.491 --> 02:39:58.450
<v Speaker 7>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

3903
02:39:58.570 --> 02:39:59.440
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And he was,</v>

3904
02:39:59.470 --> 02:40:03.190
<v Speaker 7>he was telling me about this after the</v>
<v Speaker 7>whole Robin Williams,</v>

3905
02:40:03.191 --> 02:40:06.040
<v Speaker 7>things happen because Robin Williams got</v>
<v Speaker 7>sick,</v>

3906
02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:08.530
<v Speaker 7>he got a heart condition,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he had heart surgery,</v>

3907
02:40:08.531 --> 02:40:10.450
<v Speaker 7>and then he eventually one of committing</v>
<v Speaker 7>suicide.</v>

3908
02:40:10.690 --> 02:40:12.420
<v Speaker 7>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm not saying it's the core,</v>

3909
02:40:12.460 --> 02:40:14.070
<v Speaker 7>it's the reason Robin Williams</v>

3910
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:17.190
<v Speaker 1>did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is absolutely some connection</v>

3911
02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:22.520
<v Speaker 1>between this compromised hormonal system</v>
<v Speaker 1>and depression and between a compromised</v>

3912
02:40:23.911 --> 02:40:27.510
<v Speaker 1>hormonal system and long operations</v>
<v Speaker 1>while under anesthesia.</v>

3913
02:40:27.511 --> 02:40:28.440
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

3914
02:40:28.441 --> 02:40:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Have you had a lot of guys on about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gut biome?</v>

<v Speaker 1>And how that affects your mood from</v>

<v Speaker 1>from having Chris Kresser on the last</v>

02:42:57.901 --> 02:43:01.560
<v Speaker 1>son of a bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably into orchids to [inaudible] is</v>

3980
02:43:01.561 --> 02:43:05.220
<v Speaker 1>the real problem with the social justice</v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior movement as they eat their own</v>

3981
02:43:05.221 --> 02:43:07.980
<v Speaker 1>to try to take away any sort of blame on</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

3986
02:43:17.021 --> 02:43:22.021
<v Speaker 3>demise of a vast majority of the</v>

<v Speaker 3>University and he was like this place</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got fucking students that can report</v>

3997
02:43:50.201 --> 02:43:54.070
<v Speaker 3>you blindly and then you get called up</v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of a whatever and he</v>

3998
02:43:54.150 --> 02:43:56.680
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] appropriation of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 17 to one,</v>

3999
02:43:56.681 --> 02:44:01.681
<v Speaker 3>usually like 1717 to hardcore liberal</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of leftists and one conservative to</v>

<v Speaker 3>ever do these colleges like Brown and</v>
<v Speaker 3>Columbia.</v>

4001
02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:06.910
<v Speaker 3>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said this is orthodox thinking.</v>

4002
02:44:07.060 --> 02:44:10.240
<v Speaker 3>It's so bad that they've created safe</v>
<v Speaker 3>spaces where you're not even allowed to</v>

4003
02:44:10.241 --> 02:44:13.660
<v Speaker 3>hear the other side cause it might be</v>
<v Speaker 3>violent too much.</v>

4004
02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:16.570
<v Speaker 3>So he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm creating the Jonathan Heit,</v>

<v Speaker 3>way and he's so important as a thinker,</v>

4009
02:44:27.250 --> 02:44:29.800
<v Speaker 3>he's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's one of the more influential</v>

4010
02:44:29.801 --> 02:44:32.230
<v Speaker 3>thinkers in the past 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

4011
02:44:32.440 --> 02:44:35.920
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically proving that intuition and</v>

4012
02:44:35.921 --> 02:44:38.170
<v Speaker 3>that your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your feelings control so much of your</v>

02:44:38.171 --> 02:44:40.870
<v Speaker 3>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking genius social scientist.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my shout out to Jonathan.</v>

02:44:43.781 --> 02:44:44.950
<v Speaker 3>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad I had a chance to talk about</v>

<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but powerful shout out to Jonathan Heit.</v>

4017
02:44:47.290 --> 02:44:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he created the Heterodox Academy.</v>

4018
02:44:49.721 --> 02:44:53.650
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this orthodox thinking is fucking,</v>

4019
02:44:53.980 --> 02:44:55.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is not good for anybody.</v>

4020
02:44:56.330 --> 02:44:59.830
<v Speaker 3>What we talked about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's people being tribal idea sex.</v>

4021
02:44:59.830 --> 02:45:03.430
<v Speaker 3>We need idea sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember that thing at University</v>

4022
02:45:03.431 --> 02:45:08.431
<v Speaker 3>of Missouri Without Mama and that guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>was an Asian young student photographer</v>

4023
02:45:08.830 --> 02:45:12.790
<v Speaker 3>and this woman came over and she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>yelling at him to stop taking</v>

4024
02:45:12.791 --> 02:45:15.130
<v Speaker 3>photographs because they had created a</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe space.</v>

4025
02:45:15.590 --> 02:45:17.830
<v Speaker 3>And then she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I get some muscle over here to take</v>

4026
02:45:17.831 --> 02:45:18.850
<v Speaker 3>this photographer out?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

4027
02:45:18.980 --> 02:45:20.800
<v Speaker 3>this is like the first amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

4028
02:45:20.860 --> 02:45:22.750
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need freedom of speech.</v>

4029
02:45:22.751 --> 02:45:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Freedom of the press.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was taking photographs like there's an</v>

4030
02:45:25.961 --> 02:45:28.060
<v Speaker 3>event that's happening on public</v>
<v Speaker 3>property here.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like what do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a part of the school.</v>

4032
02:45:29.711 --> 02:45:31.780
<v Speaker 3>I'm being hired to do this because she's</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

4033
02:45:31.781 --> 02:45:33.640
<v Speaker 3>she comes over and totalizing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She is,</v>

4034
02:45:33.641 --> 02:45:35.200

<v Speaker 3>She's contacting them.</v>

4035
02:45:35.260 --> 02:45:37.120
<v Speaker 3>She's not even a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's her child.</v>

4036
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:40.060
<v Speaker 3>She is a professor in training or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

4037
02:45:40.061 --> 02:45:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Anybody who disagrees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody comes to grace?</v>

4038
02:45:42.250 --> 02:45:43.570
<v Speaker 3>Look at her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She looks like a fanatic.</v>

4039
02:45:44.860 --> 02:45:46.790
<v Speaker 3>You're need to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually don't.</v>

<v Speaker 3>So crazy.</v>

4042
02:45:55.430 --> 02:45:57.140
<v Speaker 3>She's not very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4043
02:45:57.141 --> 02:45:59.390
<v Speaker 3>she got caught up in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

4044
02:45:59.391 --> 02:46:01.190
<v Speaker 3>That's really what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>More than anything.</v>

4045
02:46:01.191 --> 02:46:03.230
<v Speaker 3>She probably thought she could get away</v>
<v Speaker 3>with doing that.</v>

4046
02:46:03.410 --> 02:46:06.110
<v Speaker 3>She didn't realize how crazy it would</v>
<v Speaker 3>seem on camera saying,</v>

4047
02:46:06.220 --> 02:46:08.690
<v Speaker 3>I've got some I want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to get some muscle over here.</v>

<v Speaker 3>She her up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So she's</v>

4049
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:12.110
<v Speaker 1>chill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's thinking the same way.</v>

4050
02:46:12.410 --> 02:46:14.510
<v Speaker 1>Those that are intolerant I thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4058
02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also like she's in a heightened</v>

4059
02:46:31.881 --> 02:46:32.810
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

02:46:32.811 --> 02:46:35.660
<v Speaker 1>She's in the combat state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's immediately argumentative.</v>

4061
02:46:35.690 --> 02:46:37.910
<v Speaker 1>The guy's got a camera on her because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got anybody,</v>

4062

<v Speaker 1>homophobic.</v>

4065
02:46:43.101 --> 02:46:45.750
<v Speaker 1>And when you said when you hit somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>with racism and you go,</v>

02:46:45.751 --> 02:46:47.900
<v Speaker 1>you're a racist or sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you shut down the whole</v>

4067
02:46:47.901 --> 02:46:50.810
<v Speaker 1>debate because you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just labeled as very complex human</v>

4068
02:46:50.811 --> 02:46:52.130
<v Speaker 1>being with all kinds of emotions.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Who goes through it?</v>

4070
02:46:53.031 --> 02:46:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Some days I'm having a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hate everybody.</v>

4071
02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:57.380
<v Speaker 1>But other days I love everybody and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

4072
02:46:57.381 --> 02:46:59.030
<v Speaker 1>Then you hate black people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're racing them all.</v>

4073
02:46:59.810 --> 02:47:03.650
<v Speaker 1>But if I'm listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening or day I care about</v>

4074
02:47:03.651 --> 02:47:04.970
<v Speaker 1>terrorists and their mothers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

4075
02:47:04.971 --> 02:47:05.930
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends.</v>

4076
02:47:05.940 --> 02:47:08.030
<v Speaker 1>We all have moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you brand somebody,</v>

4077
02:47:08.180 --> 02:47:09.740
<v Speaker 1>what we do is we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a racist.</v>

4078
02:47:09.741 --> 02:47:11.330
<v Speaker 1>You said one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're racist.</v>

4079
02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to inflate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to blow that up like a big</v>

4080
02:47:13.521 --> 02:47:17.930
<v Speaker 1>balloon and fucking strap it to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>face and you are out of the conversation</v>

4081
02:47:17.931 --> 02:47:20.810
<v Speaker 1>wherever you've done ever brill cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're my competition.</v>

4082
02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:22.340
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

4083
02:47:22.520 --> 02:47:26.330
<v Speaker 1>And your ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your ideas might be threatening to me.</v>

4084
02:47:26.390 --> 02:47:27.710
<v Speaker 1>More important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're actually,</v>

4085
02:47:27.711 --> 02:47:31.040
<v Speaker 1>they create violence towards me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore I need to save space.</v>

4086
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.701
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

02:47:32.510 --> 02:47:36.260
<v Speaker 1>My side is rooted in the truth and love</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus crabs in a bucket.</v>

4089
02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:39.520

<v Speaker 1>down so I can make my way to the tip of</v>

4092
02:47:42.350 --> 02:47:45.140

<v Speaker 1>people racist.</v>

4093

<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's one of the Jordan Peterson</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions that he had with some,</v>

4111
02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it was a man who became</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman or a woman and became a man,</v>

4112
02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:29.240
<v Speaker 1>but she was a professor.</v>

4113
02:48:29.310 --> 02:48:32.780
<v Speaker 1>He's a professor of medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No professor at University of Toronto</v>

4114
02:48:32.781 --> 02:48:35.870
<v Speaker 1>professor in like transgender studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the debate.</v>

4115
02:48:35.871 --> 02:48:38.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was hilarious.</v>

4116
02:48:38.211 --> 02:48:40.400
<v Speaker 1>Debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know she's saying there's no sexual or</v>

4117
02:48:40.401 --> 02:48:41.330
<v Speaker 1>bile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

4118
02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:44.540
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>popular misconception to think that</v>

4119
02:48:44.541 --> 02:48:46.760
<v Speaker 1>there is a difference between a male and</v>
<v Speaker 1>female.</v>

4120
02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:49.180
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't exist and there was no</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological,</v>

4121
02:48:49.220 --> 02:48:51.130
<v Speaker 1>biological basis for Jenny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4122
02:48:51.131 --> 02:48:52.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4123
02:48:53.310 --> 02:48:57.740
<v Speaker 1>but if you go to the puppy door and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

4124
02:48:57.741 --> 02:49:00.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a boy puppy and they'll give you</v>

4125
02:49:00.470 --> 02:49:03.210
<v Speaker 1>a girl puppy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you say you say,</v>

4126
02:49:03.211 --> 02:49:05.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no biological basis.</v>

4127
02:49:06.050 --> 02:49:08.010
<v Speaker 1>How about the power lifter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The power lifter that</v>

4128
02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:11.850
<v Speaker 3>became a woman and was a competitive</v>
<v Speaker 3>power lifter as a man,</v>

4129
02:49:11.890 --> 02:49:13.500
<v Speaker 3>I just stop you right there because she</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a woman.</v>

4130
02:49:13.501 --> 02:49:14.700
<v Speaker 3>She's always been a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

4131
02:49:14.730 --> 02:49:15.780
<v Speaker 3>Don't be a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4132
02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:16.990
<v Speaker 3>she's a woman now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4133
02:49:16.991 --> 02:49:17.370
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4134
02:49:17.370 --> 02:49:18.840
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's always been a woman just now.</v>

4135
02:49:18.841 --> 02:49:20.550
<v Speaker 3>She gets to express herself in the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>unique way.</v>

4136
02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:25.330
<v Speaker 3>I see it when she was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though she had an xy chromosome in</v>

4137
02:49:25.331 --> 02:49:27.330
<v Speaker 3>a dick and she was competing in men's</v>
<v Speaker 3>division,</v>

4138
02:49:27.331 --> 02:49:29.550
<v Speaker 3>she was told him she was a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is so transphobic.</v>

4139
02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:32.040
<v Speaker 3>I can barely handle this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a question,</v>

4140
02:49:32.041 --> 02:49:34.140
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She is her authentic self,</v>

4141
02:49:34.430 --> 02:49:38.640
<v Speaker 3>so you get a lot of shit for your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you talk this way from I'm only by</v>

4142
02:49:38.641 --> 02:49:40.080
<v Speaker 3>people that are retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4143
02:49:40.170 --> 02:49:43.290
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like most trans gender people</v>

4144
02:49:43.500 --> 02:49:46.890
<v Speaker 3>would be very reasonable and not be</v>
<v Speaker 3>inside a bunch of transgender people</v>

4145
02:49:46.891 --> 02:49:48.060
<v Speaker 3>come to see me at the Ice House the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other day.</v>

4146
02:49:48.060 --> 02:49:49.440
<v Speaker 3>They'll give me hugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were super sweet.</v>

4147
02:49:49.470 --> 02:49:51.420
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said with the Trans community loves</v>

4148
02:49:51.421 --> 02:49:52.590
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love you guys.</v>

4149
02:49:52.650 --> 02:49:54.240
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of trans people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

4150
02:49:54.241 --> 02:49:56.520
<v Speaker 3>that we're upset at the whole Bruce</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jenner,</v>

4151
02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:58.800
<v Speaker 3>Caitlyn Jenner fiasco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

4152
02:49:58.801 --> 02:50:00.150
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not who we are.</v>

4153
02:50:00.170 --> 02:50:01.980
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just want more attention.</v>

4154
02:50:02.050 --> 02:50:04.290
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your Kardashians.</v>

4155
02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:06.660
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big Old male cardiac issue became a</v>

4156
02:50:06.661 --> 02:50:07.870
<v Speaker 3>chick settled out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4157
02:50:07.890 --> 02:50:09.450
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there's a lot of people that felt</v>

4158
02:50:09.710 --> 02:50:14.490
<v Speaker 3>sort of like also when they found out</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Bruce Jenner then became Caitlyn</v>

4159
02:50:14.490 --> 02:50:16.560
<v Speaker 3>Jenner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then after that didn't believe in</v>

4160
02:50:16.561 --> 02:50:17.394
<v Speaker 3>gay marriage.</v>

4161
02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:24.240
<v Speaker 3>So fucking weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave you just crazy.</v>

4162
02:50:24.270 --> 02:50:27.360
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be a boy who wants to be a girl</v>

4163
02:50:27.361 --> 02:50:29.610
<v Speaker 3>or a girl wants to be a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't mean you're smart,</v>

4164
02:50:29.870 --> 02:50:31.650
<v Speaker 3>but doesn't mean you're smart and that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a problem,</v>

4165
02:50:31.700 --> 02:50:32.491
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a problem.</v>

4166
02:50:32.491 --> 02:50:35.040
<v Speaker 3>And if you are an intelligent person who</v>
<v Speaker 3>is in the transgender community,</v>

4167
02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:38.310
<v Speaker 3>you don't want that as your ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 3>representation.</v>

4168
02:50:38.670 --> 02:50:40.260
<v Speaker 3>You just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want someone who's got that</v>

4169
02:50:40.261 --> 02:50:42.870
<v Speaker 3>much of a contradiction where they look</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they asked him about it.</v>

4170
02:50:42.871 --> 02:50:44.400
<v Speaker 3>One of the most crazy things he said is</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

4171
02:50:44.401 --> 02:50:45.160
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4172
02:50:45.160 --> 02:50:46.530
<v Speaker 3>forwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been the traditional work.</v>

4173
02:50:46.800 --> 02:50:49.770
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why not traditionalist?</v>

4174
02:50:49.771 --> 02:50:52.380
<v Speaker 3>You're a man who became a woman that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not traditional.</v>

4175
02:50:52.560 --> 02:50:55.580
<v Speaker 3>You don't believe in gay marriage</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's even dumber because</v>

4176
02:50:55.690 --> 02:50:59.460
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about and you're changing</v>
<v Speaker 3>biology and you're saying that some</v>

4177
02:50:59.500 --> 02:51:02.700
<v Speaker 3>manmade bullshit fucking thing called</v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage.</v>

4178
02:51:03.030 --> 02:51:04.920
<v Speaker 3>That guy shouldn't be able to do it if</v>
<v Speaker 3>they love each other.</v>

4179
02:51:04.921 --> 02:51:06.630
<v Speaker 3>But you should be able to be a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4180
02:51:06.960 --> 02:51:09.420
<v Speaker 3>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That makes me angry.</v>

4181
02:51:09.421 --> 02:51:12.360
<v Speaker 3>So making me angry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't even,</v>

4182
02:51:12.450 --> 02:51:14.160
<v Speaker 3>I ended up rubbing my eyes cause I don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>know how to,</v>

4183
02:51:14.161 --> 02:51:17.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how to respond to insanity</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the only time I've ever seen ellen go</v>

4184
02:51:17.671 --> 02:51:18.780

<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

4185
02:51:18.840 --> 02:51:23.400
<v Speaker 3>Ellen had Caitlyn Jenner on her show and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she actually went after and just notice</v>

4186
02:51:23.401 --> 02:51:25.560
<v Speaker 3>how I said her not mis-gendering cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a good person.</v>

4187
02:51:25.590 --> 02:51:27.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll vote.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's strange.</v>

<v Speaker 3>source and you called it like I'm on a</v>

<v Speaker 1>Resist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the real resist.</v>

4208
02:52:28.510 --> 02:52:30.370
<v Speaker 1>Keith Olbermann.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get what you're doing,</v>

4209
02:52:30.490 --> 02:52:34.780
<v Speaker 1>but the real resist is to fight the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense nonsense with humor.</v>

4210
02:52:34.781 --> 02:52:36.460
<v Speaker 1>We know what Michelangelo said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite,</v>

02:52:43.050 --> 02:52:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We become journalists.</v>

4215
02:52:44.680 --> 02:52:46.330
<v Speaker 1>We get high as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't say anything.</v>

4216
02:52:46.331 --> 02:52:47.060
<v Speaker 1>I forget if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I can take one hit.</v>

4220
02:52:51.980 --> 02:52:55.210
<v Speaker 1>We go to places as journalists and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>interview people,</v>

4221
02:52:55.270 --> 02:52:59.410
<v Speaker 1>whether it's we go to like a Republican</v>
<v Speaker 1>correspondence dinner or Democratic</v>

<v Speaker 1>convention or we go and you just,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

4339
02:57:00.110 --> 02:57:01.580
<v Speaker 1>we're moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll hit me,</v>

4340
02:57:01.581 --> 02:57:02.870
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not going crazy.</v>

4341
02:57:02.880 --> 02:57:03.440

4344
02:57:06.201 --> 02:57:08.000
<v Speaker 1>less hurt when you spar with someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's really good.</v>

4345
02:57:08.001 --> 02:57:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't win.</v>

4346
02:57:09.500 --> 02:57:11.690
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get tapped a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you won't get hurt.</v>

4347
02:57:11.770 --> 02:57:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll just control you and you learn</v>

4348
02:57:13.311 --> 02:57:16.010
<v Speaker 1>patterns and then pretty soon you learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>these patterns,</v>

4349
02:57:16.011 --> 02:57:18.740
<v Speaker 1>you start practicing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you go against the guy who doesn't</v>

4350
02:57:18.741 --> 02:57:21.950
<v Speaker 1>box a lot and you look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know what you're doing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>somebody can learn how to hit myths.</v>
