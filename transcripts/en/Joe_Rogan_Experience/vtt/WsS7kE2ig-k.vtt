<v Speaker 1>everybody knows what stairway sounds</v>

84
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good song go up and down and speed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look good at all.</v>

88
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.730
<v Speaker 1>And this is it cause it possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This parent was like stole it from led</v>

89
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Zeppelin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

90
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it's not because they</v>

91
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:41.521
<v Speaker 1>recorded it several years before they</v>
<v Speaker 1>tore it led Zepplin well sums it up.</v>

92
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they were cornered it like two</v>

93
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>years before Zeplin did theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's just like four chords,</v>

94
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>they played the middle of the song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

95
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the original God.</v>

96
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.033
<v Speaker 1>Let's hear it.</v>

97
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.820
<v Speaker 1>It's God damn so close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well and another argument that someone</v>

98
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're called spirit.</v>

99
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.290
<v Speaker 1>It's the name of the song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Taurus the best of spiritual?</v>

100
00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

101
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's God damn.</v>

102
00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 1>It's really close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But someone said no,</v>

103
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know shit about music and I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't either.</v>

104
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the led Zeppelin version.</v>

105
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 1>We know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

106
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 1>We know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds so sandler,</v>

107
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>but someone you don't know shit about</v>
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

108
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't play musical instruments.</v>

109
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:39.400

<v Speaker 1>Someone said that the music is like a</v>

110
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 1>very common commonly use series of chord</v>
<v Speaker 1>progression.</v>

111
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the exact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was only three chords.</v>

112
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's only three chords and rock and</v>

113
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:48.560
<v Speaker 1>roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

114
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that means but there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>still a lot of times songs,</v>

115
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.920
<v Speaker 1>blues scale is probably what it is or</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a form of interest.</v>

116
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>They said that dad has been using many</v>
<v Speaker 1>songs before.</v>

<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

119
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Once you hit like 60 you just pretend</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're old as fuck and you don't know</v>

120
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 1>what's going on anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good day.</v>

121
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.290
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't even know he had,</v>

122
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.470
<v Speaker 1>he had like legit Alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

123
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.170
<v Speaker 1>but looking back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really didn't remember.</v>

124
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.101
<v Speaker 1>We should have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

125
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 1>you didn't get pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

126
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Not believing it was a cover up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should've like,</v>

127
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.163
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always cry.</v>

128
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Cry for help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's telling the world they can't</v>

129
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>remember things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder like they're really close to</v>

130
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:30.280
<v Speaker 1>cure and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know really they're injecting</v>

131
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:34.570
<v Speaker 1>people's brains with stem cells and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixing all kinds of weird shit that's</v>

132
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:36.310
<v Speaker 1>going wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is that stem cell?</v>

133
00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:37.710
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you asked me about,</v>

134
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

135
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.420
<v Speaker 1>So you heal like wolverine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>

136
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

137
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.760
<v Speaker 1>we'll it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how far away are you going to grow your</v>

138
00:05:48.761 --> 00:05:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ari?</v>

139
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Not My Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My hair.</v>

140
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:52.240
<v Speaker 1>What about hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why that?</v>

141
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Why can't it stay there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll probably have something for that</v>

142
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno man.</v>

143
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 1>I'll never go back to here again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can I shoot back up?</v>

144
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>I like having a shaved head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy,</v>

145
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 1>so I got a good head for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look better with a shaved head than I</v>

146
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 1>did around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with the hair that I had</v>

147
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:10.020
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just all sad hair,</v>

148
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 1>sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sick hair,</v>

149
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>coffin dying people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like having a cancer patient living</v>

150
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:18.220
<v Speaker 1>on your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that though?</v>

151
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

152
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:20.810
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come on shorter.</v>

153
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 1>I like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

154
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.611
<v Speaker 1>I like having it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

155
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bullshit.</v>

156
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like it was a waste of my energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her shaved head.</v>

157
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.570
<v Speaker 1>If you have a flat back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the worst kind of head.</v>

158
00:06:31.571 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like a laptop hedge that somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>with would a shovel in the back of your</v>

159
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 1>head just looks like a laptop.</v>

160
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Is Flowering a book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of dudes that have whacked</v>

161
00:06:42.011 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 1>domes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel for them,</v>

162
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 1>but you know what men did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't look good with Harry either</v>

163
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 1>heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weird heads are weird heads we need to</v>

164
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 1>do is get one of them like a head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a fake,</v>

165
00:06:53.811 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 1>but they just put it in your head and</v>
<v Speaker 1>plants.</v>

166
00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:57.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a girl's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

167
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 1>why is it will soften the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably totally a good idea.</v>

168
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Probably most people aren't touching</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hood.</v>

169
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:05.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could always say,</v>

170
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a motorcycle accident.</v>

171
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.140
<v Speaker 1>I last guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he turned me on me mind you just had a a</v>

172
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:15.340
<v Speaker 1>but put in the back of your head like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake it,</v>

173
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 1>but it feels like like a rotting apple</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistency of it.</v>

174
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 1>We were laughing at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

175
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.150
<v Speaker 1>They do that to Chin's put double chins</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they put a fake Chin and people,</v>

176
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 1>it's super common.</v>

177
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.280
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put a fake Chin on people?</v>

178
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Who does that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plastic surgeons,</v>

179
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.730
<v Speaker 1>I think they go in through the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the lip area where the teeth are</v>

180
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.470
<v Speaker 1>and they shove like an implant in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chin because some people have a very</v>

181
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:44.870
<v Speaker 1>small chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Chin is tucked up in their neck</v>

182
00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.960
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel like it's unattractive people.</v>

183
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.050
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's chinless is bothering him.</v>

184
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes jokes about it and that's good.</v>

185
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

186
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't want to look around</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

187
00:07:56.121 --> 00:08:00.470
<v Speaker 1>so they get a piece of plastic screwed</v>
<v Speaker 1>into their chin.</v>

188
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.570
<v Speaker 1>They will take it to the next level and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then go to log.</v>

189
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.250
<v Speaker 1>They do at the back of their head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>

190
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Dudes with a flat back of the head flat</v>
<v Speaker 1>back around that shit out man.</v>

191
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Look like a normal dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not against that.</v>

192
00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.790
<v Speaker 1>I guess a not against that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they can make it feel like a skull</v>

193
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:16.580
<v Speaker 1>back there instead of just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>bench.</v>

194
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.330
<v Speaker 1>If it gets loose stretch Armstrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

195
00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:21.920
<v Speaker 1>It starts leaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you're banging a girl and she</v>

196
00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:24.120
<v Speaker 1>grabbed your head and she pops it</v>
<v Speaker 1>losing.</v>

197
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.700
<v Speaker 1>She thinks she broke your skull.</v>

198
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Big Way to go to Goldie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy bitch.</v>

199
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.360

<v Speaker 1>You did something which they get some</v>

200
00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:47.090
<v Speaker 1>fucking wallboard screws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tighten that bitch down.</v>

201
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 1>That's wholesale like replacements seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

202
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Putting a fucking plastic plate on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>back of your head is not.</v>

203
00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 2>I guarantee you there's a plastic</v>
<v Speaker 2>surgeon out there right now running to a</v>

<v Speaker 2>head while it's soft with pressure by</v>
<v Speaker 2>these chords and they tighten it down.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just didn't want to do it anymore</v>

351
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:32.060
<v Speaker 2>because if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you got to get divorced.</v>

<v Speaker 2>street?</v>

356
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.380
<v Speaker 2>If you don't care about them at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then yeah,</v>

357
00:15:45.381 --> 00:15:46.880
<v Speaker 2>that's the easier way to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

<v Speaker 2>are just fucking nuts.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you live in one of those people for a</v>

363
00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:02.660
<v Speaker 2>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you try to break up with them.</v>

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.260
<v Speaker 2>He was almost still swaying to go back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to her.</v>

382
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was almost like,</v>

383
00:16:41.411 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

384
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.090
<v Speaker 2>I can't help anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have you tried to hide someone to</v>

385
00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:46.490
<v Speaker 2>kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's out of my hands.</v>

386
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.860
<v Speaker 2>They have you on camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

387
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:52.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The power that brings you back in.</v>

388
00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.540
<v Speaker 2>And they're such good actresses when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find out,</v>

389
00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.860
<v Speaker 2>they find when they supposedly find out</v>
<v Speaker 2>that her husband got killed.</v>

390
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:01.753
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're insane.</v>

391
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:02.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

392
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's a lot of people out there</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are getting people whacked or</v>

393
00:17:05.331 --> 00:17:08.750
<v Speaker 2>completely fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can shut off.</v>

394
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just disconnected.</v>

395
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.240
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if you meant from the truth</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

396
00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.290
<v Speaker 2>if you met them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she would feel that one of you feel that</v>

397
00:17:15.291 --> 00:17:16.880
<v Speaker 2>vibe if you were talking to them.</v>

398
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:21.410
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just compartmentalizing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be you shut that door and then</v>

399
00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:24.920
<v Speaker 2>let it in as if it's new information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also people that have killed</v>

400
00:17:24.921 --> 00:17:28.550
<v Speaker 2>people before and it gets easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that story Jamie that you were</v>

401
00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:31.820
<v Speaker 2>telling me about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they suspected some seal stabbed</v>

402
00:17:31.821 --> 00:17:35.780
<v Speaker 2>some guy after a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got in a fight and then afterwards,</v>

403
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all have to pull a guy's name up.</v>

404
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows if it's even true?</v>

405
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:41.030
<v Speaker 2>He stabbed him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

406
00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:44.240
<v Speaker 2>he stabbed him cause they're the blood</v>
<v Speaker 2>lust and well they got in a fight</v>

407
00:17:44.241 --> 00:17:47.570
<v Speaker 2>apparently and then afterwards they</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrested him because the guy got stabbed</v>

408
00:17:47.571 --> 00:17:50.580
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and died and they think it</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be connected,</v>

409
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.330
<v Speaker 2>but you got to imagine it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just forget about this story,</v>

410
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:55.650
<v Speaker 2>which I don't know what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

411
00:17:55.710 --> 00:18:00.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to be fair as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a guy who you teach how to kill</v>

412
00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:03.480
<v Speaker 2>people who you hired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed people and ordered to kill</v>

413
00:18:03.481 --> 00:18:05.790
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably used to fucking killing</v>

414
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:06.660
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

415
00:18:06.661 --> 00:18:08.880
<v Speaker 2>And some people aren't and they might</v>
<v Speaker 2>say something crazy like,</v>

416
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:10.770
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking kill you bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna see you on the street.</v>

417
00:18:10.771 --> 00:18:13.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they say that to a navy seal.</v>

418
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:14.820
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

419
00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:17.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

420
00:18:17.671 --> 00:18:19.380
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm gonna remember that.</v>

421
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.490
<v Speaker 2>And then he waits to get outside of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>building and say,</v>

422
00:18:21.491 --> 00:18:23.250
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really want you to kill me so</v>

423
00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:25.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill you and he fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>kills you.</v>

424
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:30.650
<v Speaker 2>So like who knows what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would assume that if a dude gets</v>

425
00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:33.750
<v Speaker 2>super used to killing people and really</v>
<v Speaker 2>good at it,</v>

426
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.320
<v Speaker 2>that's not the kind of fuck with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

427
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to pull it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just googled it again.</v>

428
00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.710
<v Speaker 2>His lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might not have done it.</v>

429
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

430
00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:43.930
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard this thing on her right now,</v>

431
00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.360
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

432
00:18:45.361 --> 00:18:47.520
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that get in bar fights,</v>

433
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.890
<v Speaker 2>they have a lot of fucking people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate him.</v>

434
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.790
<v Speaker 2>It could easily be a coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason to that up the fight is what</v>

435
00:18:53.791 --> 00:18:56.910
<v Speaker 2>they're saying is that he detained them</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the pier for allegedly taking</v>

436
00:18:56.911 --> 00:18:58.230
<v Speaker 2>pictures of underage girls.</v>

437
00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.460
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

438
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.710
<v Speaker 2>oh Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

439
00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:02.280
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

440
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there you go.</v>

441
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.400
<v Speaker 2>There might be a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to kill that guy.</v>

442
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

443
00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.760
<v Speaker 2>if you're taking pictures of underage</v>
<v Speaker 2>girls,</v>

444
00:19:08.761 --> 00:19:11.280
<v Speaker 2>you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't like led an awesome pristine</v>

445
00:19:11.281 --> 00:19:13.950
<v Speaker 2>life and then one day you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what man?</v>

446
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I wanted to tell you to hear</v>

447
00:19:16.831 --> 00:19:18.780
<v Speaker 2>the shit they found it Michael Jackson's</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

448
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

449
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.600
<v Speaker 2>Let me think of what it could be first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

450
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean definitely under our child porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

451
00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.590
<v Speaker 2>maybe a body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

452
00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.790
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just go ahead with her.</v>

453
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.900
<v Speaker 2>I look</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a whole underground ranch,</v>

454
00:19:33.901 --> 00:19:37.320
<v Speaker 2>like another whole play area for when</v>
<v Speaker 2>the apocalypse comes,</v>

455
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.590
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or possibly even a,</v>

456
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.990
<v Speaker 2>some unreleased tapes of music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They never</v>

457
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.030
<v Speaker 2>would if they found a cash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's be honest here.</v>

458
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:53.390
<v Speaker 2>They found a cache of photos of Michael</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jackson getting his dick sucked by boys</v>

459
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:59.520
<v Speaker 2>and right next to that cash was one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best God damn albums at Michael's</v>

460
00:19:59.521 --> 00:20:00.354
<v Speaker 2>ever put out.</v>

461
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.670
<v Speaker 2>And what if the music companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that found it,</v>

462
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.240
<v Speaker 2>wait and they get together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a little music meeting.</v>

463
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.760
<v Speaker 2>When we going to be here this week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got two options.</v>

464
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Either everybody assumes that he fucks</v>
<v Speaker 2>him kids,</v>

465
00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:15.180
<v Speaker 2>but there's no proof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we forgive him and we buy his music</v>

466
00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:20.330
<v Speaker 2>or we let these photos kit out and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>ruined the legacy of one of the greatest</v>

467
00:20:20.581 --> 00:20:22.050
<v Speaker 2>artists of all time.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It would be a greater crime if we get to</v>

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.820
<v Speaker 2>loose this music to the public that burn</v>

<v Speaker 2>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One inside of claim that Michael Jackson</v>

<v Speaker 2>but what does that one insider,</v>

505
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.660
<v Speaker 2>whoever that insider or is like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never trust that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>When I read that catch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't show the pictures we're</v>

507
00:22:03.941 --> 00:22:07.780
<v Speaker 2>talking about because other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then how am I supposed to form</v>

508
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.700
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to form an opinion.</v>

509
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:10.603
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:15.220
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that term one insider sensitize it just</v>

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:17.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

513
00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:21.400
<v Speaker 2>the problem is like when you say</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that one insight or what</v>

514
00:22:21.401 --> 00:22:24.800
<v Speaker 2>that tells me is you either don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough backup up,</v>

516
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:26.310
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

517
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:27.930
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No other way other way down.</v>

518
00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:29.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

519
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.580
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ron Zone and a former Santa Barbara da</v>

520
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.840
<v Speaker 2>was on the prosecution team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Told radar.</v>

521
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:35.763
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

522
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:36.971
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

523
00:22:36.971 --> 00:22:38.770
<v Speaker 2>well that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's saying something.</v>

524
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.280
<v Speaker 2>He's saying a lot of this stuff was used</v>
<v Speaker 2>desensitize the children he added,</v>

525
00:22:42.281 --> 00:22:46.300
<v Speaker 2>we identified five different boys who</v>
<v Speaker 2>all made allegations of sexual abuse.</v>

526
00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.480
<v Speaker 2>There's not much question in my mind</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Michael was guilty of.</v>

527
00:22:49.481 --> 00:22:51.310
<v Speaker 2>Child molestation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoo.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

530
00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.230
<v Speaker 2>but that's also a guy who can never</v>
<v Speaker 2>prove it.</v>

531
00:22:56.231 --> 00:22:57.520
<v Speaker 2>So maybe he's still like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

532
00:22:57.521 --> 00:23:01.090
<v Speaker 2>but what's the weird shit is like the</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's barely a human anymore.</v>

536

<v Speaker 2>Whatever he's done to his face,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he looks like Cgi of like two years ago.</v>

<v Speaker 2>to turn herself into a real life Barbie.</v>

546
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:44.140

<v Speaker 2>So if they make skin,</v>

614
00:26:17.361 --> 00:26:21.110
<v Speaker 2>a woman got bladder cancer and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>recreate it or bladder with stem cells</v>

615
00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:24.950
<v Speaker 2>and put it back in her body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean they can't use it to</v>

616
00:26:24.951 --> 00:26:25.980
<v Speaker 2>make hair?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to,</v>

617
00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:30.740

<v Speaker 2>if you keep going right,</v>

640
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:18.090
<v Speaker 2>if you take whatever sort of a robots</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have now,</v>

641
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.380
<v Speaker 2>they have some kind of goofy looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>robots know mostly just torsos and they</v>

642
00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:25.140
<v Speaker 2>talk and some of the bodies move pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>decent.</v>

643

<v Speaker 2>It's going to be impossible for us to</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine because there's inventions that</v>

648
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.810
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be some leaps in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the very nature of the</v>

649
00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:52.230
<v Speaker 2>universe itself and they're going to be</v>

650
00:27:52.231 --> 00:27:55.650
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And life itself is also going to be on</v>

651
00:27:55.651 --> 00:27:56.850
<v Speaker 2>that list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to make it,</v>

<v Speaker 2>consideration,</v>

707
00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:00.250
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't concentrate on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

708
00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Well that's what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jackson had some sort of a sex</v>

709
00:30:02.711 --> 00:30:07.510
<v Speaker 2>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus dark too.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Super Dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like midnight.</v>

711
00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:16.660
<v Speaker 2>It's just spooky that that guy was doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that to these kids while he was the</v>

712
00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:18.970
<v Speaker 2>biggest star in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

713
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.510
<v Speaker 2>we all know it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did people still going?</v>

714
00:30:22.511 --> 00:30:24.220
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they don't want to,</v>

715
00:30:24.221 --> 00:30:26.020
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

716
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.810
<v Speaker 2>There's an elementary school near in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood,</v>

717
00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

718
00:30:30.251 --> 00:30:33.010
<v Speaker 2>the auditorium for the school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as did Michael Jackson Auditorium.</v>

719
00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Feel free to change that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least auditorium.</v>

720
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:43.000
<v Speaker 2>That's Jamie's version of for sure it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>

721
00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:46.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so true.</v>

722
00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.150
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how weird that many allegations.</v>

723
00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:52.420
<v Speaker 2>It's always a hundred percent guilty if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying that they have all this</v>

724
00:30:52.421 --> 00:30:55.900
<v Speaker 2>stuff that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird stuff too,</v>

725
00:30:55.901 --> 00:30:58.420
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mutilated animals and shit.</v>

726
00:30:58.421 --> 00:31:00.850
<v Speaker 2>Like what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if people still be like,</v>

727
00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.760
<v Speaker 2>he did everything but he did everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he just liked to cuddle with them at</v>

728
00:31:03.761 --> 00:31:05.240
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't do anything creepy to them.</v>

729
00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:07.630
<v Speaker 2>He looked at pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not an actions.</v>

730
00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take a kid's head,</v>

731
00:31:09.401 --> 00:31:11.500
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might be the only way he could</v>

732
00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:14.740
<v Speaker 2>legally possess child pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for what?</v>

733
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:18.090
<v Speaker 2>That might be the only way he could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>legally possessed child pornography.</v>

734
00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.570
<v Speaker 2>He was taking a photo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

735
00:31:19.571 --> 00:31:23.230
<v Speaker 2>taking a photo of a kid's head and</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting it on an adult's body.</v>

736
00:31:23.231 --> 00:31:25.810
<v Speaker 2>We're two adults are having sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is apparently what he did.</v>

737
00:31:25.811 --> 00:31:27.820
<v Speaker 2>He's impose the photos or had someone do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

738
00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:33.180
<v Speaker 2>That might be like a legal loophole that</v>
<v Speaker 2>allows you to watch child porn.</v>

739
00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:35.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

740
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you could have that and you know,</v>

741
00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.700
<v Speaker 2>he's a really good job of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

742
00:31:39.701 --> 00:31:40.720
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm saying.</v>

743
00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.360
<v Speaker 2>I want to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there's any loopholes</v>

744
00:31:43.361 --> 00:31:46.330
<v Speaker 2>for child porn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not child porn.</v>

745
00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:48.700
<v Speaker 2>I've a guy of a little boy's face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

746
00:31:48.701 --> 00:31:50.440
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you might have a point though,</v>

747
00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:55.910
<v Speaker 2>because I think I read something</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently about they were taking God damn</v>

748
00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:56.590
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the,</v>

749
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:57.490
<v Speaker 2>they were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

750
00:31:57.491 --> 00:32:00.050
<v Speaker 2>it was about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had to do with anime and had to do an</v>

751
00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.950
<v Speaker 2>animated stuff and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

752
00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:03.933
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>

753
00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:08.080
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty explicitly saying that</v>
<v Speaker 2>even animated child pornography,</v>

754
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.400
<v Speaker 2>like if you did like CGI child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Toronto.</v>

755
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

756
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

757
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:14.650
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

758
00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it sound like?</v>

759
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Fosters it urge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if they're like little animate baby</v>

760
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:22.800
<v Speaker 2>pandas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a release in urge to let</v>

761
00:32:22.801 --> 00:32:26.080
<v Speaker 2>them jerk off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard because you know what,</v>

762
00:32:26.081 --> 00:32:27.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm with you and no one gets hurt in</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

763
00:32:27.641 --> 00:32:32.641
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like a hypocrite because I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>always resisted the pornography equals</v>

764
00:32:32.831 --> 00:32:35.680
<v Speaker 2>rape of women because I just don't think</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

765
00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:39.010
<v Speaker 2>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't do that to me.</v>

766
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:42.710
<v Speaker 2>Just because it doesn't do that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean it can't foster that in</v>

767
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:44.270
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's one of those things where like,</v>

768
00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:44.960
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

769
00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.260
<v Speaker 2>if you eat a whole bottle of aspirin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could fucking die.</v>

770
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Should we only sell aspirin one at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>time to prevent death?</v>

771
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:52.940
<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should you have to go to the store and</v>

772
00:32:52.941 --> 00:32:56.000
<v Speaker 2>buy one aspirin or should I fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust you with a hundred Aspen in here?</v>

773
00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:56.631
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust me,</v>

774
00:32:56.631 --> 00:32:57.710
<v Speaker 2>I trust you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

775
00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.890
<v Speaker 2>So that's gotta be the same way with</v>
<v Speaker 2>porn because for a lot of us,</v>

776
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.410
<v Speaker 2>you watch porn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just watching two people have sex.</v>

777
00:33:03.411 --> 00:33:05.060
<v Speaker 2>You get excited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you jerk off,</v>

778
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.010
<v Speaker 2>you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You move on with your life,</v>

779
00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.440
<v Speaker 2>you're taking care of a biological need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

780
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:13.160
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't foster some fucking need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>rape in a normal person.</v>

781
00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:17.150
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had sex in two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like how you bend down when you say</v>

782
00:33:17.151 --> 00:33:17.660
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

783
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:20.120
<v Speaker 2>oh</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

784
00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:20.973
<v Speaker 2>start thinking,</v>

785
00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:24.470
<v Speaker 3>not getting lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not wash up.</v>

786
00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:26.580
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's been an update as of today,</v>

787
00:33:26.581 --> 00:33:30.720
<v Speaker 3>since probably maybe since we've been</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing podcasts that say a Michael</v>

788
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.400
<v Speaker 3>Jackson's estate reached out to vanity</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair,</v>

789
00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:34.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and said everything in these reports,</v>

790
00:33:34.921 --> 00:33:38.130
<v Speaker 3>including what the county of Santa</v>
<v Speaker 3>Barbara calls content that appears to be</v>

791
00:33:38.131 --> 00:33:40.380
<v Speaker 3>obtained off the internet or through</v>
<v Speaker 3>unknown sources.</v>

792
00:33:40.381 --> 00:33:42.900
<v Speaker 3>It's false.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course they would be that guy.</v>

793
00:33:42.901 --> 00:33:45.870
<v Speaker 3>Just tell it to get him because he never</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw it's one website that started</v>

794
00:33:45.871 --> 00:33:46.830
<v Speaker 3>reporting all this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

795
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:49.280
<v Speaker 2>that could be called be bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

796
00:33:49.550 --> 00:33:50.600
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be bullshit.</v>

797
00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:52.010
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to throw out the evidence of</v>

798
00:33:52.011 --> 00:33:53.060
<v Speaker 2>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the former Da,</v>

799
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:54.560
<v Speaker 2>cause he's definitely got an ax to</v>
<v Speaker 2>grind.</v>

800
00:33:54.561 --> 00:33:56.860
<v Speaker 2>He's not impartial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could be a,</v>

801
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:58.940
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Upset that he didn't nab that guy.</v>

802
00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's just talking about it now.</v>

803
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.951
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

804
00:34:00.951 --> 00:34:02.540
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's when you read everything,</v>

805
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:03.920
<v Speaker 2>start out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>

806
00:34:03.921 --> 00:34:04.820
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you know,</v>

807
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:08.960
<v Speaker 2>like if you knew that guy was guilty and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't do anything about it,</v>

808
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:11.270
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't get them and you were a</v>
<v Speaker 2>former dea,</v>

809
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.210
<v Speaker 2>you would fucking go to great lengths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck him.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fuck his legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we did that shit.</v>

811
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:19.430
<v Speaker 2>You remember that during the Mark</v>
<v Speaker 2>Furhman days?</v>

812
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Would they be accused Mark Furhman a</v>
<v Speaker 2>planting evidence?</v>

813
00:34:21.951 --> 00:34:23.450
<v Speaker 2>I think they're pretty sure he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

814
00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Dante?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sure he planted evidence like you</v>

815
00:34:26.541 --> 00:34:27.500
<v Speaker 2>planted blood or something</v>

816
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:28.850
<v Speaker 3>done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A documentary that,</v>

817
00:34:28.851 --> 00:34:30.770
<v Speaker 3>I haven't watched it all yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were saying something about it.</v>

818
00:34:30.771 --> 00:34:34.160
<v Speaker 3>He showed up with a baseball bat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>some crazy shit and had to like talk him</v>

819
00:34:34.161 --> 00:34:35.840
<v Speaker 3>away from having a baseball bat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

820
00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:36.651
<v Speaker 3>Jay did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

821
00:34:36.651 --> 00:34:37.580
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark Furhman did.</v>

822
00:34:37.581 --> 00:34:40.130
<v Speaker 3>I think he showed up somewhere with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>baseball bat at night when the three</v>

823
00:34:40.131 --> 00:34:44.170
<v Speaker 3>detectives and he was one of the shots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a bat with them like he was going</v>

824
00:34:44.171 --> 00:34:46.310
<v Speaker 3>to feed them Oj or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

825
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:48.860
<v Speaker 3>are you sure you don't have that story</v>
<v Speaker 3>screwed up?</v>

826
00:34:48.861 --> 00:34:51.440
<v Speaker 3>I thought I'll look bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look up again.</v>

827
00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:53.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oj was looking at him.</v>

828
00:34:53.211 --> 00:34:55.040
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't have come out of the house</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he sold out or something.</v>

829
00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:58.350
<v Speaker 2>So Mark Furman was out of his house with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a baseball bat.</v>

830
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.810
<v Speaker 2>He's a loose cannon ready to beat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ogf.</v>

831
00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.770
<v Speaker 2>But why would a cop have a baseball bat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you have a gun?</v>

832
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.310
<v Speaker 2>Guns are better to use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you just want to beat the guy maybe.</v>

833
00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intimidation factor.</v>

834
00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.540
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's not going to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like maybe he's into that walking</v>

835
00:35:12.541 --> 00:35:13.374
<v Speaker 2>tall movie.</v>

836
00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:16.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay did have mark furhman had to pull</v>

837
00:35:16.971 --> 00:35:19.680
<v Speaker 3>out a baton on Oj Simpson to get him to</v>
<v Speaker 3>drop a baseball bat.</v>

838
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:23.060
<v Speaker 3>Battered Nicole when called police.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was before that happened.</v>

839
00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:25.370
<v Speaker 3>How dare you make me so roping shooting</v>
<v Speaker 3>holes.</v>

840
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:26.623
<v Speaker 3>How dare you.</v>

841
00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.260
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that we can do a hunting podcasts.</v>

842
00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting holes.</v>

843
00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holding dear.</v>

844
00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:38.580
<v Speaker 2>But the point was they think that mark</v>
<v Speaker 2>and planted evidence though.</v>

845
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:39.660
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

846
00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.400
<v Speaker 2>if he did though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they said.</v>

847
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone said he did.</v>

848
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they prove that to the</v>

849
00:35:45.541 --> 00:35:47.430
<v Speaker 2>prosecutor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept telling the press for sure or</v>

850
00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:48.630
<v Speaker 2>not the prosecutors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a fence.</v>

851
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

852
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.513
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

853
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.770
<v Speaker 2>there was something 30 for 30 no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not.</v>

854
00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.120
<v Speaker 2>I heard it's awesome though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hopefully the best documentary ever</v>

859
00:36:03.811 --> 00:36:04.760

<v Speaker 2>Like be out for a month before you</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide that it's the best thing.</v>

861
00:36:10.231 --> 00:36:13.500
<v Speaker 2>I was a bit shorter at Sundance and</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone watched the whole thing there</v>

862
00:36:13.501 --> 00:36:16.320
<v Speaker 2>and then it's got two words for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grizzly man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Everybody stop man.</v>

864
00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:22.060

<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

865
00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:24.380
<v Speaker 2>but if the guy planted evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my point wasn't,</v>

866
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:28.140
<v Speaker 2>he knew that Oj did it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If Oj had beat up his girlfriend before</v>

867
00:36:28.141 --> 00:36:31.320
<v Speaker 2>his wife before and he had a baseball</v>
<v Speaker 2>bat and they had to talk him down and</v>

868
00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was his football star and</v>

869
00:36:33.061 --> 00:36:36.120
<v Speaker 2>everybody kept it under wraps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he fucking knew that the guy did it</v>

870
00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:38.010
<v Speaker 2>like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy was like close to doing it in a</v>

871
00:36:38.011 --> 00:36:40.200
<v Speaker 2>couple of times and never did it like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this with the baseball bat.</v>

872
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what that fucking thought</v>

<v Speaker 2>of these gloves.</v>

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:48.720
<v Speaker 2>Dip in a little bit of blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chuck it in his fucking bushes.</v>

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.860

<v Speaker 2>bag.</v>

881
00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Zip it tight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take it over to the lab.</v>

889
00:37:15.991 --> 00:37:18.000

<v Speaker 2>If you open your fingers,</v>

890
00:37:18.001 --> 00:37:22.270
<v Speaker 2>you're doing them to articulate your</v>
<v Speaker 2>fingers into the holes that you don't</v>

<v Speaker 2>glove underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh that's even more.</v>

895
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's let's show a video of it.</v>

896
00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just one of the most preposterous</v>

897
00:37:36.001 --> 00:37:38.720
<v Speaker 2>moments in history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They interrupted my,</v>

898
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.340
<v Speaker 2>some sort of social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sociology class in college and let</v>

<v Speaker 2>See this a don't know food.</v>

903
00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's got rubber gloves on underneath</v>

904
00:37:51.811 --> 00:37:56.811
<v Speaker 2>and he's pretending he can't get it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It fits great for those rubber gloves.</v>

905
00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:59.543
<v Speaker 2>Look at that</v>

906
00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:04.720
<v Speaker 2>fifth grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

907
00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.290
<v Speaker 2>that's a little off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little off on,</v>

908
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I can see what he's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kingdom over the knuckle.</v>

909
00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:11.140
<v Speaker 2>One 64 eight through the right hand</v>
<v Speaker 2>glove.</v>

910
00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:12.723
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

911
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:14.151
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

912
00:38:14.151 --> 00:38:15.830
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like he's pretending like he's</v>

913
00:38:15.831 --> 00:38:18.290
<v Speaker 2>trying to get them on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't look as preposterous as I</v>

914
00:38:18.291 --> 00:38:19.124
<v Speaker 2>remember.</v>

915
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:20.050
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

916
00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:22.550
<v Speaker 2>What I remember it me Ma Fatty Bravo's</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

917
00:38:22.551 --> 00:38:25.600
<v Speaker 2>He'd have me convinced me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you bro,</v>

918
00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.570
<v Speaker 2>it's his son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 2>let me see these gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oj pull him up.</v>

920
00:38:30.791 --> 00:38:32.950

<v Speaker 2>He's actually legitimate and he's try.</v>

921
00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.080
<v Speaker 2>He's trying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he does have rubber gloves,</v>

922
00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:35.990
<v Speaker 2>our needs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think</v>

923
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:38.290
<v Speaker 1>of those are a pair of no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big difference.</v>

924
00:38:38.291 --> 00:38:40.180
<v Speaker 1>If you have a pair of Italian racing</v>
<v Speaker 1>gloves,</v>

925
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.190
<v Speaker 1>those are those are those the thin</v>
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>

926
00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the point.</v>

927
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus Italian racing gloves.</v>

928
00:38:44.891 --> 00:38:48.010
<v Speaker 1>They fit right over your skin there for</v>
<v Speaker 1>racing.</v>

929
00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.310
<v Speaker 1>That's what those are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are like,</v>

930
00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:55.020
<v Speaker 1>and Martin Ran Quebec,</v>

1048
00:43:09.321 --> 00:43:12.720
<v Speaker 2>But the feeling remains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a weird one when he came through</v>

1049
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.860
<v Speaker 2>the cigarette thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're a weird one in that,</v>

1050
00:43:15.861 --> 00:43:17.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1051
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.070
<v Speaker 2>when you describe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1052
00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:23.780
<v Speaker 2>you have a very honest way of describing</v>
<v Speaker 2>the addiction to cigarettes and that,</v>

1053
00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:25.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a smart dude so you know exactly</v>

1054
00:43:25.881 --> 00:43:27.220
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excellent.</v>

1055
00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.730
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what's going on?</v>

1056
00:43:28.731 --> 00:43:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Like the weirdness of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the addiction to cigarettes.</v>

1057
00:43:31.851 --> 00:43:33.230
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you quit,</v>

1058
00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.680
<v Speaker 2>when you quit and you would talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this desire,</v>

1059
00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:39.530
<v Speaker 2>even though you intellectualize the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's chemical addiction,</v>

1060
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:43.490
<v Speaker 2>but your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your way of describing it is very honest</v>

1061
00:43:43.491 --> 00:43:44.750
<v Speaker 2>in the way that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1062
00:43:44.751 --> 00:43:45.600
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're a,</v>

1063
00:43:45.601 --> 00:43:48.050
<v Speaker 2>it's like a demon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't get around it.</v>

1064
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Like it'll over.</v>

1065
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:49.603
<v Speaker 2>It'll fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

1066
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:56.170
<v Speaker 2>come back to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>climbs into your breath.</v>

1067
00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.660
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you again,</v>

1068
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:02.360
<v Speaker 2>moving around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your lungs</v>

1069
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:09.550
<v Speaker 2>feel so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Thailand for years and moved</v>

1070
00:44:09.861 --> 00:44:11.780
<v Speaker 2>from a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a cigar too,</v>

1071
00:44:11.781 --> 00:44:12.800
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a quick,</v>

1072
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:14.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really have heroin.</v>

1073
00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:18.520
<v Speaker 2>We were in a zoo late at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>PDC had a cigarette.</v>

1074
00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:18.981
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1075
00:44:18.981 --> 00:44:20.750
<v Speaker 2>this feels fucking right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Warm Out,</v>

1076
00:44:20.751 --> 00:44:21.800
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1077
00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Let me have one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I smoked like two or three quarters of</v>

1078
00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:26.540
<v Speaker 2>it had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1079
00:44:26.541 --> 00:44:26.961
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

1080
00:44:26.961 --> 00:44:28.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the next day I was like,</v>

1081
00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:29.763
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a cigarette.</v>

1082
00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.010
<v Speaker 2>It was right back in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like you were saying,</v>

1083
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.800
<v Speaker 2>just like that outcome that's exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets in there again.</v>

1084
00:44:34.801 --> 00:44:35.401
<v Speaker 2>I had to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1085
00:44:35.401 --> 00:44:35.890
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1086
00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:36.770
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1087
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.180
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I made a mistake last night.</v>

1088
00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.000
<v Speaker 5>Smart people smoked cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1089
00:44:42.001 --> 00:44:43.950
<v Speaker 5>we should not have done that again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get no</v>

1090
00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:49.440
<v Speaker 5>better when I'm relaxing or just coming</v>
<v Speaker 5>for a second,</v>

1091
00:44:49.441 --> 00:44:52.210
<v Speaker 5>but then you got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1092
00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:54.390
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we shouldn't do that.</v>

1093
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:55.500
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on,</v>

1095
00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:02.310

<v Speaker 5>That was the last time.</v>

1096
00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.370
<v Speaker 5>No more after this though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

1097
00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:06.943
<v Speaker 5>Say it.</v>

1098
00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:08.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1101
00:45:15.461 --> 00:45:17.500
<v Speaker 2>girlfriend started smoking again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1102
00:45:17.501 --> 00:45:19.030
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just did it in the weekend in Philly.</v>

1103
00:45:19.031 --> 00:45:19.421
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1104
00:45:19.421 --> 00:45:20.260

1106
00:45:20.591 --> 00:45:21.370
<v Speaker 2>we're quitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1107
00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:23.140
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you already saying what we're going to</v>

1108
00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:24.550
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've already fully committed to</v>

1109
00:45:24.551 --> 00:45:27.460
<v Speaker 2>smoking and it's been like a year and</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they're still smoking.</v>

1110
00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:28.871
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1111
00:45:28.871 --> 00:45:33.310
<v Speaker 2>they say it has that nicotine has new</v>
<v Speaker 2>tropic properties to it.</v>

1112
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Just like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Alpha brain or neuro one has the</v>

1113
00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:41.770
<v Speaker 2>checkbook was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like a mental stimulant in</v>

1114
00:45:41.771 --> 00:45:45.820
<v Speaker 2>the salary increases memory increases</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive function.</v>

1115
00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.560
<v Speaker 2>It's not a stimulant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like um,</v>

1116
00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:49.030
<v Speaker 2>a lot of writers write on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1117
00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:50.830
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of writers do.</v>

1118
00:45:50.831 --> 00:45:53.820
<v Speaker 2>And you know what I started doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of Joey Diaz,</v>

1119
00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:56.710
<v Speaker 2>I'll just get one of those blue</v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarette things and I'll suck on them</v>

1120
00:45:56.711 --> 00:45:57.580
<v Speaker 2>before a show.</v>

1121
00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.260
<v Speaker 2>Nicotine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1122
00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:00.730
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's not negative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1123
00:46:00.731 --> 00:46:03.940
<v Speaker 2>it's not nicotine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to worry about nicotine is</v>

1124
00:46:03.941 --> 00:46:05.920
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually has health benefits.</v>

1125
00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.560
<v Speaker 2>Nicotine's was addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1126
00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:09.213
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1127
00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:10.960
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work like that with me.</v>

1128
00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>To crave the ecigarette more.</v>

1129
00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:14.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1130
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:18.310
<v Speaker 2>I might not have one for a month and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then sometimes I like to suck on them</v>

1131
00:46:18.311 --> 00:46:21.010
<v Speaker 2>before a show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in a ring a tech now you're</v>

1132
00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:23.710
<v Speaker 2>probably doesn't react to wait tables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They be though.</v>

1133
00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:24.730
<v Speaker 2>I think it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1134
00:46:24.731 --> 00:46:26.080
<v Speaker 2>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicotine,</v>

1135
00:46:26.081 --> 00:46:28.180
<v Speaker 2>I guess it would would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1136
00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Well I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I smoked a cigarette the other day with</v>

1137
00:46:30.221 --> 00:46:31.320
<v Speaker 2>the duck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stan hope.</v>

1138
00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:32.140
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1139
00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:34.990
<v Speaker 2>I didn't smoke a cigarette,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I took a hit of his cigarette and I</v>

1140
00:46:34.991 --> 00:46:37.880
<v Speaker 2>took a hit of Tony Hinchcliffe cigarette</v>
<v Speaker 2>once before I went on stage.</v>

1141
00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:39.280
<v Speaker 2>Just good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels good to you.</v>

1142
00:46:39.281 --> 00:46:40.114
<v Speaker 2>A little buzz.</v>

1143
00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:43.060
<v Speaker 2>So I just want one hit but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1144
00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.250
<v Speaker 2>I remember that blows off a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>

1145
00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm woozy for a little bit because if</v>

1146
00:46:47.621 --> 00:46:50.290
<v Speaker 2>you don't smoke and you take a hit off</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a cigarette,</v>

1147
00:46:50.291 --> 00:46:53.680
<v Speaker 2>it definitely gives you like a weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>little buzz was the carcinogen to,</v>

1148
00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:57.100
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think there's also some sort of</v>

1149
00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.740
<v Speaker 2>stimulating factor of all those</v>
<v Speaker 2>different chemicals.</v>

1150
00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:02.440
<v Speaker 2>The FDA kindly allows them to put into</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shit.</v>

1151
00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.780
<v Speaker 2>So what's the addicted then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the good thing that gets you</v>

1152
00:47:04.781 --> 00:47:06.190
<v Speaker 2>addicted?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of factors.</v>

1153
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:11.490
<v Speaker 2>One of it is smoking of the cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the nicotine in that form is</v>

1154
00:47:12.071 --> 00:47:15.970
<v Speaker 2>apparently more addictive in some</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange way.</v>

1155
00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:19.330
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's because of the delivery</v>
<v Speaker 2>method is more powerful and potent.</v>

1156
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's because of all the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemical.</v>

1157
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:23.320
<v Speaker 2>You see that inside or movie with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russell Crowe.</v>

1158
00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:23.950
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see that?</v>

1159
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:25.570
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're talking about though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good fucking movie.</v>

1160
00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:27.580
<v Speaker 2>If it's factual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if it is,</v>

1161
00:47:27.581 --> 00:47:30.490
<v Speaker 2>but I think it is cause you got to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ducks in a row when you make a</v>

1162
00:47:30.491 --> 00:47:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn Expo's a movie with Russell</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crowe about the cigarette industry.</v>

1163
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.100
<v Speaker 2>It's got to sound right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most likely.</v>

1164
00:47:36.101 --> 00:47:37.780
<v Speaker 2>If they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean otherwise it wouldn't be</v>

1165
00:47:37.781 --> 00:47:40.270
<v Speaker 2>available anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would do or remove it from itunes</v>

1166
00:47:40.271 --> 00:47:42.880
<v Speaker 2>and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's essentially Russell Crowe,</v>

1167
00:47:42.881 --> 00:47:46.090
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a super scientist that they have</v>

1168
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:49.360
<v Speaker 2>engineered the cigarettes to make them</v>
<v Speaker 2>more addictive than he testifies about</v>

1169
00:47:49.361 --> 00:47:51.910
<v Speaker 2>it and they go to his house and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>scare him and they threatened them and</v>

1170
00:47:51.911 --> 00:47:52.610
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1171
00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:54.070
<v Speaker 2>it's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking creepy.</v>

1172
00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so apparently it's true though.</v>

1173
00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.770
<v Speaker 2>There are a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemicals,</v>

1174
00:47:59.771 --> 00:48:03.760
<v Speaker 2>like hundreds of them that they allow</v>
<v Speaker 2>these companies to put it into</v>

1175
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:07.210
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes that altered the flavor</v>
<v Speaker 2>profile and all sorts of other different</v>

1176
00:48:07.211 --> 00:48:09.850
<v Speaker 2>things to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also makes them more addictive.</v>

1177
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:13.150
<v Speaker 2>And he outlined them in the movie and</v>
<v Speaker 2>explains how they engineered it.</v>

1178
00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.360
<v Speaker 2>So that's why when you've taken a hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>off those things,</v>

1179
00:48:16.361 --> 00:48:19.840
<v Speaker 2>it's different than a cigar or different</v>
<v Speaker 2>than a lot of other ways that you're</v>

1180
00:48:19.841 --> 00:48:23.380
<v Speaker 2>getting tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even like chewing tobacco was</v>

1181
00:48:23.381 --> 00:48:25.360
<v Speaker 2>addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get addicted to that shit.</v>

1182
00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Like in their mouths can get addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's soaking jerking off.</v>

1183
00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.680
<v Speaker 2>So kind of different though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like mental addiction,</v>

1184
00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:35.140
<v Speaker 2>soaking coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coffee can be addicted to coffee for</v>

1185
00:48:35.141 --> 00:48:38.170
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Busted Nicotine does not cause</v>

1186
00:48:38.171 --> 00:48:41.770
<v Speaker 2>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They ain't go e health forum just as</v>

1187
00:48:41.771 --> 00:48:46.510
<v Speaker 2>about as in you to take cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicotine by itself is only a mild</v>

1188
00:48:46.511 --> 00:48:47.450
<v Speaker 2>central,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1189
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.920
<v Speaker 2>central system stimulant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Similar to caffeine has very mild</v>

1190
00:48:50.921 --> 00:48:53.830
<v Speaker 2>addictive properties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also much like caffeine.</v>

1191
00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know for a fact the caffeine is pretty</v>

1192
00:48:58.151 --> 00:48:59.120
<v Speaker 2>fucking addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1193
00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:01.870
<v Speaker 2>You have the trolls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have enough caffeine headaches when you</v>

1194
00:49:01.871 --> 00:49:03.060
<v Speaker 2>quit that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1195
00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:03.400
<v Speaker 2>that's all.</v>

1196
00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:07.270
<v Speaker 2>It was a quick seat cushions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going way too hard.</v>

1197
00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at one point in time writing where I</v>

1198
00:49:10.331 --> 00:49:10.990
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1199
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:15.990
<v Speaker 2>make a pot a fucking coffee and I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>down that shit at like 9:00 PM and write</v>

1200
00:49:17.111 --> 00:49:18.880
<v Speaker 2>till five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six o'clock in the morning,</v>

1201
00:49:18.881 --> 00:49:23.320
<v Speaker 2>just jacked out of my mind on coughing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I tried to quit that I had a</v>

1202
00:49:23.321 --> 00:49:25.420
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had headaches.</v>

1203
00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.760
<v Speaker 2>Like my head was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1204
00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:30.760
<v Speaker 2>like I was my brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body was like,</v>

1205
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:32.260
<v Speaker 2>it's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to deal with a</v>

1206
00:49:32.261 --> 00:49:37.261
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous amount of stimulants over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>course of like seven hours or I gear up.</v>

1207
00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:42.010
<v Speaker 2>And then once I shut the fucking fun</v>
<v Speaker 2>farm down there,</v>

1208
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.761
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1209
00:49:42.761 --> 00:49:44.830
<v Speaker 2>where's all got used to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on Bro.</v>

1210
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.410
<v Speaker 2>Headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long do the headaches last for a</v>

1211
00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:48.600
<v Speaker 2>couple of days to started drinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee.</v>

1212
00:49:48.601 --> 00:49:51.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm no</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1213
00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:54.340
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never drank it like that again.</v>

1214
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:57.220
<v Speaker 2>I'll never drink more than a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>cups a day,</v>

1215
00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.800
<v Speaker 2>but I thought it was bad for you at one</v>
<v Speaker 2>point in time,</v>

1216
00:49:59.801 --> 00:50:01.580
<v Speaker 2>which has also been debunked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tiffin.</v>

1217
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:03.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No coffee itself.</v>

1218
00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee itself is not bad for you and</v>

1219
00:50:05.711 --> 00:50:10.000
<v Speaker 2>caffeine in the form of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily bad for you either,</v>

1220
00:50:10.001 --> 00:50:13.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's like one of those things where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can fuck it up if you just go too</v>

1221
00:50:13.451 --> 00:50:15.400
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like what I was doing when I was</v>

1222
00:50:15.401 --> 00:50:16.420
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was drinking,</v>

1223
00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:20.770
<v Speaker 2>like literally pots of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably like overwhelming my adrenals</v>

1224
00:50:20.771 --> 00:50:24.100
<v Speaker 2>and to get that late night starbucks in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sacramento.</v>

1225
00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And sleep like babies.</v>

1226
00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:27.650
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going bedtime.</v>

1227
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Just write them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>

1228
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Tate loves coffee so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never gotten to that shit.</v>

1229
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:35.750
<v Speaker 1>It's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me feel good</v>

1230
00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.280
<v Speaker 1>taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people stopping kids.</v>

1231
00:50:40.460 --> 00:50:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

1232
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Well it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also like a lot of other ways</v>

1233
00:50:45.291 --> 00:50:47.000
<v Speaker 1>that you can get caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1234
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:49.050
<v Speaker 1>you can get caffeine and rebase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1235
00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:50.600
<v Speaker 1>you can get it in other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1236
00:50:50.730 --> 00:50:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Coke,</v>

1239
00:50:58.401 --> 00:50:59.990
<v Speaker 1>it's like a stimulant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a tea,</v>

1266
00:51:58.041 --> 00:51:59.540
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a full day.</v>

1267
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:03.090
<v Speaker 1>We stopped in Nashville and then we</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped at Memphis the next night,</v>

1268
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.600
<v Speaker 1>like 10 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1269
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:06.760
<v Speaker 1>10 hours through Nashville.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1272
00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.480
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think of states like</v>

1273
00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you drive 10 hours,</v>

00:52:14.211 --> 00:52:15.530
<v Speaker 1>you're not in Massachusetts anymore.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing a show where I'm like a</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1294
00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:57.920
<v Speaker 1>for people don't understand why he did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1295
00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was fucked up on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kind of had to do that.</v>

1296
00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's fucked up at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or just super tired.</v>

1297
00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:06.080
<v Speaker 1>Even drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you usually drugs.</v>

1298
00:53:06.140 --> 00:53:07.190
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a drug.</v>

1299
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a drug festival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But drunk is a drug we fucked up in</v>

1300
00:53:10.791 --> 00:53:15.791
<v Speaker 1>classification of drugs in this country</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a new breeding is any of those sort</v>

1301
00:53:15.831 --> 00:53:16.820
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a drug.</v>

1302
00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:20.270
<v Speaker 1>But somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've found ourselves in this position</v>

1303
00:53:20.271 --> 00:53:22.670
<v Speaker 1>where most people are in denial that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do drugs.</v>

1304
00:53:22.671 --> 00:53:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Why they drank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1305
00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:27.710
<v Speaker 1>And then you're gonna put mushroom</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin in the same category growers</v>

1306
00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:30.290
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1307
00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.610
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

1308
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:35.910
<v Speaker 1>But we've been hoodwinked by Booz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

1309
00:53:35.911 --> 00:53:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I don't like booze.</v>

1310
00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so much more sexist.</v>

1311
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Socially acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1312
00:53:42.241 --> 00:53:44.130
<v Speaker 1>Way More drunk driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1313
00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Way More everything here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1314
00:53:45.421 --> 00:53:47.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name said in Canada should</v>

1315
00:53:47.941 --> 00:53:48.774
<v Speaker 1>go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1316
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:51.030
<v Speaker 1>What'd he say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the first guy to take the stance on</v>

1317
00:53:51.031 --> 00:53:54.150
<v Speaker 1>this where instead of saying the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>side always takes,</v>

1318
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.040
<v Speaker 1>we've got to protect children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>children are going to get it.</v>

1319
00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:58.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the only defense against that is</v>

1320
00:53:58.591 --> 00:54:00.870
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's got benefits to sick people</v>

1321
00:54:00.871 --> 00:54:03.090
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really a defense of their</v>

1322
00:54:03.091 --> 00:54:03.960
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1323
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Trudeau is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Candida has like I think like top five</v>

1324
00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:10.770
<v Speaker 1>instance of underage people getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

1325
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:13.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like really bad there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like we're already not protecting</v>

1326
00:54:13.831 --> 00:54:17.790
<v Speaker 1>them cause let's regulate it so that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can protect kids cause he goes,</v>

1327
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:19.440
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be legal but I also</v>

1328
00:54:19.441 --> 00:54:21.390
<v Speaker 1>see there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's problems with people getting it</v>

1329
00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:22.920
<v Speaker 1>when they're developing when the mine is</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing.</v>

1330
00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:25.500
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's do what we can keep it out of</v>

1331
00:54:25.501 --> 00:54:28.020
<v Speaker 1>their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is legalization regularization</v>

1332
00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:29.370
<v Speaker 1>regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation,</v>

1333
00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.880
<v Speaker 1>regulation like alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If alcohol was fully illegal and you</v>

1334
00:54:32.881 --> 00:54:36.240
<v Speaker 1>just get it from mafia guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 year old would have the same access</v>

1335
00:54:36.241 --> 00:54:38.310
<v Speaker 1>as 34 year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good point.</v>

1336
00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:40.820
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the best point for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1337
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Because cats are going to find some cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>22 year old.</v>

1338
00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:47.220
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way they can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That 22 year olds taking a big chance.</v>

1339
00:54:47.221 --> 00:54:49.110
<v Speaker 1>He's days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a giant felony.</v>

1340
00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1341
00:54:50.341 --> 00:54:54.660
<v Speaker 1>When we were kids it wasn't nothing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake id or stealing from your dad always</v>

1342
00:54:54.661 --> 00:54:57.510
<v Speaker 1>sold booze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would wait outside the liquor store</v>

1343
00:54:57.511 --> 00:55:00.960
<v Speaker 1>and buy booze for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You tell him to give him 20 bucks.</v>

1344
00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:03.610
<v Speaker 1>They didn't give him a feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 1>surcharge than the price of them.</v>

1345
00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:04.440
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1346
00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Just tell the guy will give you 20 bucks</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go and uh,</v>

1347
00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:10.590
<v Speaker 1>get a fucking one may or may not view</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive throughs and they just give it to</v>

1348
00:55:10.591 --> 00:55:11.880
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we were at 17,</v>

1349
00:55:11.881 --> 00:55:12.750
<v Speaker 1>18 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1350
00:55:12.751 --> 00:55:14.370
<v Speaker 1>They didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't,</v>

1351
00:55:14.371 --> 00:55:16.890
<v Speaker 1>especially in Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that trying to get you drunk.</v>

1352
00:55:16.891 --> 00:55:18.690
<v Speaker 1>So stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1353
00:55:18.691 --> 00:55:20.580
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get somebody pregnant.</v>

1354
00:55:20.581 --> 00:55:21.590
<v Speaker 1>We can't lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1355
00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.580
<v Speaker 1>That was another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to keep you around.</v>

1356
00:55:23.581 --> 00:55:26.520
<v Speaker 1>So if getting your drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just how we do it.</v>

1357
00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird that we have this one drug we</v>

1358
00:55:31.171 --> 00:55:32.530
<v Speaker 1>give a pass to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1359
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:35.370
<v Speaker 1>And it's the one is the most destructive</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your health.</v>

1360
00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:37.200
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking bananas.</v>

1361
00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:39.180
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get into fights.</v>

1362
00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:44.400
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem is it's existed for</v>
<v Speaker 1>so long and it hasn't changed yet.</v>

1363
00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:48.870
<v Speaker 1>In spite of all we know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like more recently this Nixon thing</v>

1364
00:55:48.871 --> 00:55:53.871
<v Speaker 1>came out where they admitted that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole reason why they instituted this</v>

1365
00:55:54.601 --> 00:55:59.601
<v Speaker 1>war on drugs is to try to break up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil rights movement and to try it.</v>

1366
00:55:59.851 --> 00:56:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to try to break up the anti war</v>

1367
00:56:02.611 --> 00:56:03.600
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>

1368
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Because they knew that the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in the civil rights movement.</v>

1369
00:56:06.331 --> 00:56:08.080
<v Speaker 1>We're doing dry rot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1370
00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Tammy or fast Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the best,</v>

1371
00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:12.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the civil rights movement and the</v>

1372
00:56:12.121 --> 00:56:15.060
<v Speaker 1>antiwar movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing marijuana.</v>

1373
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:19.050
<v Speaker 1>So they decided there are always the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1374
00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the way to go after them to</v>

1375
00:56:21.361 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 1>break up those organizations by</v>
<v Speaker 1>arresting their members for</v>

1376
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.590
<v Speaker 2>drug related crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>locking him up in jail.</v>

1377
00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop Line.</v>

1378
00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that means,</v>

1379
00:56:29.591 --> 00:56:32.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's one of those things where,</v>

1380
00:56:32.440 --> 00:56:35.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd hear like an Alex Jones type guy</v>

1381
00:56:35.111 --> 00:56:36.340
<v Speaker 2>talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1382
00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:37.860
<v Speaker 2>don't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1383
00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:39.340
<v Speaker 2>it's actual proof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1384
00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:42.340
<v Speaker 2>Then you see something like this and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that is exactly how they are still</v>

1385
00:56:42.341 --> 00:56:43.420
<v Speaker 2>stuck in your head of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1386
00:56:43.421 --> 00:56:44.500
<v Speaker 2>but they're different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1387
00:56:44.501 --> 00:56:46.060
<v Speaker 2>you know that there was a wikileaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1388
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:48.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that facebook has apparently</v>

1389
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.370
<v Speaker 2>centering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that?</v>

1390
00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:53.590
<v Speaker 2>That was another one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to talk to you about.</v>

1391
00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:57.490
<v Speaker 2>What they're saying that there was all</v>
<v Speaker 2>this Hillary Clinton emails at Facebook</v>

1392
00:56:57.491 --> 00:57:00.550
<v Speaker 2>is censoring that they don't want to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1393
00:57:00.580 --> 00:57:03.770
<v Speaker 2>that wikileaks is trying to print and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then facebook says we won't let you</v>

1394
00:57:03.771 --> 00:57:04.601
<v Speaker 2>retweet that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1395
00:57:04.601 --> 00:57:05.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what,</v>

1396
00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:07.570
<v Speaker 2>how they stop something like that.</v>

1397
00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Or what about this leak?</v>
<v Speaker 2>About about some Hillary Clinton stuff.</v>

1398
00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:11.620
<v Speaker 2>What are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1399
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:14.500
<v Speaker 2>the packers said he gave it to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1400
00:57:14.501 --> 00:57:17.080
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is like you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust the hacker.</v>

1401
00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:17.441
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1402
00:57:17.441 --> 00:57:19.480
<v Speaker 2>you don't trust the Hatcher who has</v>
<v Speaker 2>Julian assange.</v>

1403
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:21.490
<v Speaker 2>That's who trusts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause he's never let us down.</v>

1404
00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:24.310
<v Speaker 2>He's only putting out stuff that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sounds like a good team.</v>

1405
00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying his word is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will put out real shit.</v>

1406
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:29.980
<v Speaker 2>Only keep that up so I get to take a</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at it.</v>

1407
00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do your facebook stop censoring or</v>

1408
00:57:32.021 --> 00:57:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton email release?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1409
00:57:33.611 --> 00:57:36.790
<v Speaker 2>really stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no technical issue,</v>

1410
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:39.130
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1411
00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And wiki leaks.</v>

1412
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Wiki leaks is putting that up on twitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a photograph of it.</v>

1413
00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:49.030
<v Speaker 2>This is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they see,</v>

1414
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:52.360
<v Speaker 2>the problem is when you're getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>something from a guy who hacked into</v>

1415
00:57:52.361 --> 00:57:55.090
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her email server,</v>

1416
00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.750
<v Speaker 2>how is it not possible that he could</v>
<v Speaker 2>trick them?</v>

1417
00:57:59.090 --> 00:58:04.090
<v Speaker 2>He's so fucking smart that he can get</v>
<v Speaker 2>into her email server trick to Hillary</v>

1418
00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they got into her email to get this</v>

1419
00:58:07.721 --> 00:58:10.330
<v Speaker 2>stuff right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is what they're saying.</v>

1420
00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:14.380
<v Speaker 2>So how do we know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could do that,</v>

1421
00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:18.940
<v Speaker 2>can make it look like he did it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can make it look like,</v>

1422
00:58:18.941 --> 00:58:22.480
<v Speaker 2>say that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone who can hack into a server that</v>

1423
00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:26.440
<v Speaker 2>just tell me if I'm right or a mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's not the only person that</v>

1424
00:58:26.441 --> 00:58:28.990
<v Speaker 2>that was claimed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've hacked the servery Russian hackers</v>

1425
00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:31.810
<v Speaker 2>as of yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I saw the same say they're in</v>

1426
00:58:31.811 --> 00:58:33.960
<v Speaker 2>there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a gang of different people</v>

1427
00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:35.710
<v Speaker 2>have hacked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think once you get that,</v>

1428
00:58:35.810 --> 00:58:37.810
<v Speaker 2>the issue is she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about it.</v>

1429
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.940
<v Speaker 2>I have this secret server on my own for</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1430
00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:40.680
<v Speaker 2>no reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to,</v>

1431
00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:41.800
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to know.</v>

1432
00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:46.150
<v Speaker 2>30,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>322 emails pulled from a private account</v>

1433
00:58:46.151 --> 00:58:49.360

<v Speaker 2>secretary of state.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had this guy in here who,</v>

<v Speaker 2>any things that she did,</v>

1437

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1442
00:59:16.451 --> 00:59:18.160
<v Speaker 2>They're talking about with an Africa at</v>
<v Speaker 2>a diner and it's like,</v>

1443
00:59:18.161 --> 00:59:20.110
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people doing the indicting are her</v>

1444
00:59:20.111 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 2>buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they're not to indict or especially</v>

1445
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.560
<v Speaker 1>not till after she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she loses then maybe,</v>

1446
00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:27.290
<v Speaker 1>but not beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is all coming out like right now.</v>

1447
00:59:27.291 --> 00:59:27.831
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1448
00:59:27.831 --> 00:59:31.110
<v Speaker 1>it looks like she's going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nominee for the Democrats and it looks</v>

1449
00:59:31.111 --> 00:59:33.020
<v Speaker 1>like this is the part at home where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people start going,</v>

1450
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:35.150
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fucking hate you when you talk about</v>

<v Speaker 1>politics because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no shit.</v>

1452
00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:39.500
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The politics behind and come Thursday</v>

1453
00:59:39.501 --> 00:59:40.920
<v Speaker 1>night to the comics for 9:00 PM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>great.com or go to the comedy store.com.</v>

1455
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring her friend,</v>

1456
00:59:48.090 --> 00:59:50.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does the terrible time for this stuff to</v>

1457
00:59:50.541 --> 00:59:52.160
<v Speaker 1>come out because there's no other</v>
<v Speaker 1>option.</v>

1458
00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Like it would have to be Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only other option.</v>

1459
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Like are either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would like have to be in debt.</v>

1460
00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:00.470
<v Speaker 1>I had to come out like a month and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>half or two weeks ago and they don't</v>

1461
01:00:00.471 --> 01:00:00.950
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

1462
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Like when people look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know whether or not Bernie</v>

1463
01:00:03.681 --> 01:00:06.250
<v Speaker 1>can win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people are pretty sure that Hillary</v>

1464
01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.380
<v Speaker 1>is going to win because you can get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of women.</v>

1465
01:00:08.381 --> 01:00:10.370
<v Speaker 1>They're going to vote on her just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because she's a woman.</v>

1466
01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:13.370
<v Speaker 1>I think they don't want it to look that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie does better against sanders.</v>

1467
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm we getting started trump than</v>
<v Speaker 1>hillary does against trump.</v>

1468
01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.380
<v Speaker 1>By the police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are these polls?</v>

1469
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Who's taking them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who these fucking people.</v>

1470
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:21.223
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

1471
01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't just look at sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fet here's,</v>

1472
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Jamie had a really good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good point.</v>

1473
01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:29.000
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come you see all this hype for</v>

1474
01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:32.870
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders and you don't see any</v>
<v Speaker 1>hype for Clinton and yet Clinton's still</v>

1475
01:00:32.871 --> 01:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>wins these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1476
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>a lot of friction because you had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have changed from an independent to a</v>

1477
01:00:38.661 --> 01:00:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Democrat like months ago and then when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time to vote,</v>

1478
01:00:42.261 --> 01:00:43.810
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I can't vote in the primary cause</v>

1479
01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:44.653
<v Speaker 1>I'm an independent.</v>

1480
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both Democrats.</v>

1481
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:48.770
<v Speaker 1>How many Hillary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The primaries?</v>

1482
01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm second in the primary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then it's too late for them to vote</v>

1483
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.090
<v Speaker 1>in the primary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1484
01:00:53.091 --> 01:00:54.680
<v Speaker 1>so they didn't register in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're saying?</v>

1485
01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:55.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to be registered as</v>

1486
01:00:55.851 --> 01:00:56.684
<v Speaker 1>independent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1487
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.801
<v Speaker 1>And then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1488
01:00:57.801 --> 01:00:59.540
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they're going to vote</v>

1489
01:00:59.541 --> 01:01:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do they have to be registered as</v>

1490
01:01:01.881 --> 01:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>independent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1491
01:01:02.841 --> 01:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>they are not following you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all these people that are</v>

1492
01:01:04.341 --> 01:01:05.800
<v Speaker 1>registered independent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>

1493
01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican,</v>

1494
01:01:06.711 --> 01:01:09.560
<v Speaker 1>independent advice to people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>registered as independent couldn't vote</v>

1495
01:01:09.561 --> 01:01:10.880
<v Speaker 1>in the Democratic primary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1496
01:01:10.881 --> 01:01:11.714
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

1497
01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:13.870
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1498
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:17.240
<v Speaker 1>so that's one of the reasons why you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>more support than that.</v>

1499
01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:18.910
<v Speaker 1>He's actually getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point was more like,</v>

1500
01:01:18.911 --> 01:01:19.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't see it very are.</v>

1501
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't very many hillary like bumper</v>
<v Speaker 1>stickers and signs and online support.</v>

1502
01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:26.360
<v Speaker 1>That's what Santa more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1503
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:28.040
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like joining Costco.</v>

1504
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>You're joining a club to join the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrat club and that's how you get to</v>

1505
01:01:32.331 --> 01:01:34.970
<v Speaker 1>vote in the Democratic primaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking ridiculous.</v>

1506
01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:38.330
<v Speaker 1>How come he can't just vote?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come I registered voter can't just</v>

1507
01:01:38.331 --> 01:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a registered Democrat to</v>

1508
01:01:40.011 --> 01:01:41.630
<v Speaker 1>vote for the primary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1509
01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.770
<v Speaker 1>you should be able to go independent</v>
<v Speaker 1>slash Democrat should be able to do</v>

1510
01:01:45.771 --> 01:01:48.050
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't vote in these</v>

1511
01:01:48.051 --> 01:01:50.480
<v Speaker 1>primaries that have been happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the issue.</v>

1512
01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.700
<v Speaker 1>This is madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just picking our candidates.</v>

1513
01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:56.930
<v Speaker 1>None of it matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're all just voting on who gets the</v>

1514
01:01:56.931 --> 01:01:59.000
<v Speaker 1>paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what a better way to control the</v>

1515
01:01:59.001 --> 01:02:03.470
<v Speaker 1>system by making you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be a registered member of</v>

1516
01:02:03.471 --> 01:02:05.690
<v Speaker 1>the party in order to vote in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>primaries.</v>

1517
01:02:05.691 --> 01:02:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>

1518
01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:08.900
<v Speaker 1>If that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to keep going.</v>

1519
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>It's often not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some states it's state to state.</v>

1520
01:02:10.861 --> 01:02:12.340
<v Speaker 1>It literally matters depending on where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

1521
01:02:12.341 --> 01:02:15.380
<v Speaker 1>Let's say like a tea party guy and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're an independent that beside the</v>

1522
01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>also good buddy guy go drown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't vote for the Republican</v>

1523
01:02:19.651 --> 01:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>primary if you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would definitely go for trump.</v>

1524
01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't do that either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not as I think problematic.</v>

1525
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I think the tea party started off with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good idea,</v>

1526
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>but somewhere along the line the morons</v>
<v Speaker 1>took over.</v>

1527
01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the first of all,</v>

1528
01:02:30.481 --> 01:02:32.400
<v Speaker 1>calling it the tea party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey guys.</v>

1529
01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about a new name?</v>

1530
01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Why do you call yourself the wallets?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A historical precedent.</v>

1531
01:02:40.041 --> 01:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>The face sat when they threw the tea</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the ocean to protest Great Britain.</v>

1532
01:02:43.891 --> 01:02:48.891
<v Speaker 1>You will mot tax or tariff os fuck up</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tea party and occupy the same thing</v>

1533
01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>you guys have Sarah Pailin sober.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sarah Palin's,</v>

1534
01:02:53.341 --> 01:02:54.450
<v Speaker 1>your cow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right lips.</v>

1535
01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>They let people talk for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were like two down the people,</v>

1536
01:02:57.331 --> 01:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>they should have talked for dummies in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they,</v>

1537
01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:02.070
<v Speaker 1>she know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes like a business.</v>

1538
01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're like one of those bitchy</v>

1539
01:03:04.501 --> 01:03:06.840
<v Speaker 1>housewives and everybody knows you as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bitchy housewife,</v>

1540
01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:07.681
<v Speaker 1>I'll put more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1541
01:03:07.681 --> 01:03:09.330
<v Speaker 1>you got to ramp it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do now.</v>

1542
01:03:09.331 --> 01:03:12.750
<v Speaker 1>You gotta throw drinks at bitches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like claws leaves off.</v>

1543
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.080
<v Speaker 1>That must be tiring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's exhausting to be that lady.</v>

1544
01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:17.550
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably off work.</v>

1545
01:03:17.551 --> 01:03:21.000
<v Speaker 1>It's probably like the sheep dog and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>coyote born in Sam morning,</v>

1546
01:03:21.001 --> 01:03:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Ralph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go off to the other</v>

1547
01:03:22.650 --> 01:03:23.010
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>

1548
01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Conversations go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me one second.</v>

1549
01:03:24.721 --> 01:03:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I have to fill this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a sec.</v>

1550
01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:27.860
<v Speaker 1>What'd you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch?</v>

1551
01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:29.461
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

1552
01:03:29.461 --> 01:03:31.320
<v Speaker 1>Where were we?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's what happens.</v>

1553
01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.161
<v Speaker 1>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1554
01:03:32.161 --> 01:03:34.410
<v Speaker 1>they take on a role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1555
01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:37.950
<v Speaker 1>and they just get caught up in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't vote.</v>

1556
01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.350
<v Speaker 1>It's pointless or bought a home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay home.</v>

1557
01:03:42.050 --> 01:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like this way has got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking meltdown in front of our face</v>

1558
01:03:48.301 --> 01:03:50.190
<v Speaker 1>until we come up with a better way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1559
01:03:50.191 --> 01:03:51.930
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so dumb.</v>

1560
01:03:51.931 --> 01:03:56.931
<v Speaker 1>This is like some colonial feather</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing fucking parchment bullshit.</v>

1561
01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:03.560
<v Speaker 1>The rich people get money from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations and the rich people keeping</v>

1562
01:04:03.601 --> 01:04:05.960
<v Speaker 1>the ones deciding how the elections go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1563
01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:10.350
<v Speaker 1>So they're going to decide to make it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little more favor towards them.</v>

1564
01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to register for a party to</v>

1565
01:04:13.051 --> 01:04:13.884
<v Speaker 1>vote in the primary.</v>

1566
01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I can't do that while you're</v>

1567
01:04:18.031 --> 01:04:19.230

<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like that's like being a fucking raiders</v>

<v Speaker 1>people have to offer and I'm not,</v>

1573
01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:38.100
<v Speaker 1>not saying anything bad about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>raiders fan base in sports.</v>

<v Speaker 1>stone temple pilots played a Dana</v>
<v Speaker 1>White's birthday party and they go,</v>

1654
01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:48.550
<v Speaker 1>they went for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mashed it,</v>

1655
01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:52.630
<v Speaker 1>they smashed it all the way to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>might've been a crazy junkie out of his</v>

1656
01:07:52.631 --> 01:07:55.090
<v Speaker 1>fucking mind.</v>

1657
01:07:55.091 --> 01:07:57.820
<v Speaker 1>that jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But knowing that 200 people there less,</v>

1658
01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:01.330
<v Speaker 1>maybe 200 but there were scattered all</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout this.</v>

1659
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:04.570
<v Speaker 1>We got to get people to get closer</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the stage and kind of get</v>

1660
01:08:04.571 --> 01:08:07.360
<v Speaker 1>excited about the fact that it's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>stone temple pilots,</v>

1661
01:08:07.361 --> 01:08:10.300
<v Speaker 1>pilots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy could have been in a football</v>

1662
01:08:10.301 --> 01:08:13.540
<v Speaker 1>stadium filled with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would have done the exact same show.</v>

1663
01:08:13.541 --> 01:08:15.560
<v Speaker 1>That's how strong it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put up a video of it.</v>

1664
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:16.543
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1665
01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:18.320
<v Speaker 1>I know way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1666
01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:21.600

<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] behind him?</v>

1667
01:08:21.850 --> 01:08:22.683
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's going on?</v>

1668
01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:23.673
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

1669
01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:31.060
<v Speaker 5>Goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where is that?</v>

1670
01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was that.</v>

1671
01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:35.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what it was.</v>

1672
01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:42.830
<v Speaker 1>And then stone temple pilots is in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

1673
01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:44.150
<v Speaker 1>You don't get no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1674
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:46.370
<v Speaker 1>that's just a surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

1675
01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:49.370
<v Speaker 1>That's nice and all but oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1676
01:08:49.550 --> 01:08:51.380
<v Speaker 1>I thought maybe the video I definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

1677
01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.300
<v Speaker 1>but the sound was so loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1678
01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:54.770
<v Speaker 1>it was useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh right.</v>

1679
01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Cause those was my shitty iphone video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1680
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:59.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like six years ago to six years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

1681
01:08:59.421 --> 01:09:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

1682
01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:01.820
<v Speaker 1>you can't replicate that kind of sound</v>
<v Speaker 1>into an iphone,</v>

1683
01:09:01.821 --> 01:09:03.860
<v Speaker 1>but when you're there at the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just noise.</v>

1684
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:06.740
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't even understand what the</v>

1685
01:09:06.741 --> 01:09:08.540
<v Speaker 1>fuck it was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1686
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:13.570
<v Speaker 1>my point being that guy was all for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went for it more than you could ever</v>

1687
01:09:14.241 --> 01:09:18.020
<v Speaker 1>have hoped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he just fucking cranked it out.</v>

01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

1689
01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:22.130
<v Speaker 1>And it made me want to maybe want to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

1690
01:09:22.131 --> 01:09:24.080
<v Speaker 1>I can go do better and go right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Am I wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1734
01:11:03.710 --> 01:11:05.110

<v Speaker 1>If it's good.</v>

1770
01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Some rockers after a while they just get</v>
<v Speaker 1>beaten down by the pressure and fans and</v>

1771
01:12:34.441 --> 01:12:39.390
<v Speaker 1>negativity and all that jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the intoxicating sound of the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just the opposite.</v>

1792
01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.150
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socks bunny could be worse than ojs</v>

1808
01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:22.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always looked like trans,</v>

1809
01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:25.900
<v Speaker 2>never got fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he stayed skinny all these years,</v>

1810
01:14:26.530 --> 01:14:28.690
<v Speaker 2>but that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still running around.</v>

1811
01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's got a lot of energy and it's</v>

1812
01:14:30.521 --> 01:14:32.280
<v Speaker 2>kind of camel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus,</v>

1813
01:14:32.281 --> 01:14:33.770
<v Speaker 2>that bald.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

1814
01:14:33.771 --> 01:14:36.580
<v Speaker 2>And he did not give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't give a fuck.</v>

1815
01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still Mick Jagger.</v>

1816
01:14:37.841 --> 01:14:40.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing thing about a rockstar.</v>

1817
01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Rockstars are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the same guy.</v>

1818
01:14:42.761 --> 01:14:47.050
<v Speaker 2>It's Mick Jagger at 72 he's shuffling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1819
01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:49.000
<v Speaker 2>he's doing everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's strutting.</v>

1820
01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:52.390
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's moving loose and relaxed.</v>

1821
01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not moving like a seven year old</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

1822
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:58.670
<v Speaker 2>He's got a lot of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently.</v>

1823
01:14:58.671 --> 01:15:01.280
<v Speaker 2>He's just a fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A fanatic about working out.</v>

1824
01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:04.040
<v Speaker 2>Works out every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is according to Brian Count though.</v>

1825
01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:04.970
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't might've made that up.</v>

1826
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:08.143
<v Speaker 4>You never know.</v>

1827
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:09.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people say it works out every day.</v>

1828
01:15:09.801 --> 01:15:10.760
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't matching.</v>

1829
01:15:10.761 --> 01:15:13.010
<v Speaker 2>So exaggeration for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he works out like four times a week.</v>

1830
01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:14.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think working out every day is</v>

1831
01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:16.120
<v Speaker 2>mart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1832
01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Cause the mill and do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I eat a lot of people.</v>

1833
01:15:18.561 --> 01:15:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Definitely do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think it's the move.</v>

1834
01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:24.230
<v Speaker 2>I think your body responds better when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you give it a little breaks.</v>

1835
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:24.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1836
01:15:24.711 --> 01:15:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Rebuild one day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've heard,</v>

1837
01:15:26.061 --> 01:15:27.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think the,</v>

1838
01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:32.570
<v Speaker 2>but what is also important is you build</v>
<v Speaker 2>up a certain level like with Mick Jagger</v>

1839
01:15:32.571 --> 01:15:35.450
<v Speaker 2>and then you maintain that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very critical that you maintain</v>

1840
01:15:35.451 --> 01:15:39.170
<v Speaker 2>that level because once you dip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you just can't get it back.</v>

1841
01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:41.180
<v Speaker 2>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's super hard to get it back.</v>

1842
01:15:41.181 --> 01:15:42.620
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking 72 man,</v>

1843
01:15:42.650 --> 01:15:43.483
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

1844
01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:46.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll also bone start to break and</v>

1845
01:15:46.161 --> 01:15:50.120
<v Speaker 2>then this guy on the podcast earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shane Dorian,</v>

1846
01:15:50.150 --> 01:15:51.440
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big wave surfer.</v>

1847
01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Great Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting.</v>

1864
01:16:35.301 --> 01:16:39.560
<v Speaker 2>This would explain his ability to sing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and move continuously during a concert</v>

1865
01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:42.020

<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

1884
01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:24.410
<v Speaker 1>He's stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it is not moving at all.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I find this hard to believe though for</v>

1893
01:17:47.301 --> 01:17:50.810
<v Speaker 3>two hour concert it means he's moving at</v>
<v Speaker 3>least six miles an hour when you clearly</v>

1894
01:17:50.811 --> 01:17:53.420

<v Speaker 2>That looks like a dinosaur.</v>

1965
01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:30.150
<v Speaker 2>It's huge dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

1966
01:20:30.450 --> 01:20:32.520
<v Speaker 2>that's not even like the biggest one</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever caught.</v>

1967
01:20:32.590 --> 01:20:34.090
<v Speaker 2>They can size of a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1968
01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Oh way bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How'd or Halibut is crazy.</v>

1969
01:20:36.241 --> 01:20:37.320
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He jumped in the water.</v>

1970
01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:40.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That when you get a perspective,</v>

1971
01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:42.360
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How big is that?</v>

1972
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:44.520
<v Speaker 2>12 feet long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just size of him.</v>

1973
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if it was dark out and you saw it in</v>

1974
01:20:47.041 --> 01:20:50.160
<v Speaker 2>the water and you were in a boat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would shit your pants and say</v>

1975
01:20:50.161 --> 01:20:53.380
<v Speaker 2>there's a monster in that water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that thing has,</v>

1976
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:55.260
<v Speaker 2>that thing exists and he caught that.</v>

1977
01:20:55.500 --> 01:21:00.010
<v Speaker 2>It's super possible that there could be</v>
<v Speaker 2>some thing that's super similar to that.</v>

1978
01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:02.370
<v Speaker 2>The somebody overhearing you in a bar</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1979
01:21:02.371 --> 01:21:03.990
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you this thing is massive.</v>

1980
01:21:03.991 --> 01:21:06.060
<v Speaker 2>It was a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you went to the bathroom and</v>

1981
01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:07.770
<v Speaker 2>you just spread that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>

1982
01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:11.070
<v Speaker 2>but it definitely could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see something like that,</v>

1983
01:21:11.071 --> 01:21:13.410
<v Speaker 2>like what's the most recent explanation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

1984
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of the sturgeon he</v>
<v Speaker 2>calls.</v>

1985
01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:17.120
<v Speaker 2>That's the size of a person.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1988
01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.190

<v Speaker 2>Halibut's like 300 pounds or something</v>

1989
01:21:26.191 --> 01:21:31.080
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people catch hundred pound</v>

1990
01:21:31.081 --> 01:21:34.410
<v Speaker 2>ones on TV and they have to pull it into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the boat and it's just like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was like five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six years before that attended before or</v>

2012
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:27.841
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2013
01:22:27.841 --> 01:22:28.740
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2014
01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.200
<v Speaker 2>we went salmon fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Devon went halibut fishing,</v>

2015
01:22:31.201 --> 01:22:33.450
<v Speaker 2>but the water was too choppy because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wind,</v>

2016
01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:34.890
<v Speaker 2>so he couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't the line all the way.</v>

2017
01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:37.260
<v Speaker 2>The bottom we just gave up and went in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2018
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:39.870
<v Speaker 2>Hallo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bid is the best tasting though,</v>

2019
01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.110
<v Speaker 2>in I opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2020
01:22:41.111 --> 01:22:44.130
<v Speaker 2>And when you bake halibut with like some</v>
<v Speaker 2>butter and a little bit of garlic.</v>

2021
01:22:44.850 --> 01:22:48.870
<v Speaker 2>I liked like the river,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the river and lake fishes.</v>

2022
01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Well they don't taste as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

2023
01:22:50.641 --> 01:22:52.950
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think the,</v>

2024
01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:56.850
<v Speaker 2>the fish that are in the ocean or more</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardy and I think they're more durable</v>

2025
01:22:56.851 --> 01:22:58.290
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't like,</v>

2026
01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:01.230
<v Speaker 2>they don't get nasty as quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like this doesn't make any</v>

2027
01:23:01.231 --> 01:23:02.310
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is what I'm saying.</v>

2028
01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference in the taste between</v>

2029
01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 2>catching them and cooking</v>

2030
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.560
<v Speaker 1>them like on the shore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a trout or something like that</v>

2031
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:11.130
<v Speaker 1>versus a tuna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you gave,</v>

2032
01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:13.960
<v Speaker 1>you know you can cook it like a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours later and I'll still be all right.</v>

2033
01:23:14.350 --> 01:23:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Well I heard that's what I heard about</v>

2038
01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:25.960
<v Speaker 1>If you cook it right on the shore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right on the shore,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say I'm surprised he's a real</v>

2271
01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:45.550
<v Speaker 2>piece of shit manager.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the right crazy guy.</v>

2276
01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:59.140
<v Speaker 2>100% right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't like we had a lot of</v>

2277
01:33:59.830 --> 01:34:01.570
<v Speaker 2>leverage when they were just signing</v>
<v Speaker 2>with some other,</v>

<v Speaker 2>They couldn't do shit.</v>

2279
01:34:03.191 --> 01:34:05.260
<v Speaker 2>But I'm thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you know that you got to go to</v>

2280
01:34:05.261 --> 01:34:06.730
<v Speaker 2>TMZ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Just know where to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look what's happening with that.</v>

2283
01:34:11.261 --> 01:34:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that,</v>

2284
01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:14.710
<v Speaker 2>that singer girl's name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wants to get out of her contract?</v>

2285
01:34:14.711 --> 01:34:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Catia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cassia.</v>

2286
01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:16.710
<v Speaker 2>Kesha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kesha.</v>

2287
01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Like it hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean who knows what the truth is</v>

2288
01:34:19.301 --> 01:34:21.220
<v Speaker 2>behind that story or what's really going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

2289
01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:25.000
<v Speaker 2>But it's kind of a similar thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or producer was having sex with her</v>

2290
01:34:25.001 --> 01:34:27.380
<v Speaker 2>apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she said he was raped her or this is</v>

2291
01:34:27.381 --> 01:34:28.230
<v Speaker 2>not what she said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2292
01:34:28.240 --> 01:34:32.140
<v Speaker 2>isn't that like what the accusation is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile she's tied into a contract</v>

2293
01:34:32.141 --> 01:34:34.240
<v Speaker 2>with this dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she can't make music unless she makes</v>

2294
01:34:34.241 --> 01:34:35.170
<v Speaker 2>it with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2295
01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:38.230
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's crazy.</v>

2296
01:34:38.231 --> 01:34:39.850
<v Speaker 2>If it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2297
01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:41.350
<v Speaker 2>The judge was in a tough spot on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

2298
01:34:42.450 --> 01:34:43.630
<v Speaker 2>What do you do there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause he's like,</v>

2299
01:34:43.690 --> 01:34:44.950
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a contract,</v>

2300
01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:47.440
<v Speaker 2>but if nothing happens then you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>honor your contract.</v>

2301
01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no proof of this.</v>

2302
01:34:50.650 --> 01:34:52.030
<v Speaker 2>If it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's horrible.</v>

2303
01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:53.440
<v Speaker 2>But either way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no proof of it.</v>

2304
01:34:53.441 --> 01:34:55.930
<v Speaker 2>So we can't just go on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were saying alleging this cause then</v>

2305
01:34:55.931 --> 01:34:56.830
<v Speaker 2>everyone would just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

01:34:56.831 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 2>right out of my contract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

2307
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:59.630

01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:00.960
<v Speaker 1>so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2309
01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:02.600
<v Speaker 1>unless I have a proof of something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

2310
01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:06.200
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing I can do like right by</v>
<v Speaker 1>like contract law.</v>

2311
01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty heinous crime.</v>

2312
01:35:08.930 --> 01:35:10.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2313
01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:11.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's denying it too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

2314
01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah he's definitely denying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's one of those really heinous</v>

2315
01:35:15.621 --> 01:35:16.850
<v Speaker 1>crimes where you gotta go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2316
01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:20.780
<v Speaker 1>how do you find out who the fuck told</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth?</v>

2317
01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:23.300
<v Speaker 1>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a hard crime to prove.</v>

2318
01:35:25.070 --> 01:35:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when they get really upset</v>

2319
01:35:27.021 --> 01:35:29.030
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's like so hard to prove it.</v>

2320
01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also sets it up for like this thing</v>

2321
01:35:32.421 --> 01:35:34.240
<v Speaker 1>we never supposed to question a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2322
01:35:34.450 --> 01:35:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Well Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say never.</v>

2323
01:35:36.650 --> 01:35:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you definitely shouldn't</v>

2324
01:35:38.630 --> 01:35:40.660
<v Speaker 1>automatically question the victim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2325
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:43.880
<v Speaker 1>But if something seems goofy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should not question the victim.</v>

2326
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Like people lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know people that have had false rape</v>

2327
01:35:47.961 --> 01:35:49.630
<v Speaker 1>accusations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know as a curse.</v>

2328
01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:52.690
<v Speaker 1>I was going through it in New York and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody in his level,</v>

2329
01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:55.760
<v Speaker 1>like we know she's crazy and that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just not a thing.</v>

2330
01:35:55.790 --> 01:35:57.320
<v Speaker 1>Did it can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're telling her like,</v>

2331
01:35:57.321 --> 01:35:58.490
<v Speaker 1>stop saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2332
01:35:58.491 --> 01:36:02.150
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can happen just like there can be</v>

2333
01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:04.970
<v Speaker 1>crazy men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there can be crazy women.</v>

2334
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:08.900
<v Speaker 1>There's this crazy people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that will absolutely</v>

2335
01:36:08.901 --> 01:36:11.300
<v Speaker 1>fucking make up a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2336
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:13.220
<v Speaker 1>And the second is if you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it or if you're like,</v>

2337
01:36:13.221 --> 01:36:16.080
<v Speaker 1>well how David you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're not going to be yes.</v>

2338
01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:21.280
<v Speaker 1>So becomes one of those things where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the person who is</v>

2339
01:36:23.090 --> 01:36:26.630
<v Speaker 1>accused of doing it is also being</v>
<v Speaker 1>victimized.</v>

2340
01:36:26.631 --> 01:36:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're supposed to ignore that victim</v>

2341
01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:33.030
<v Speaker 1>and concentrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problems are based on this idea of</v>

2342
01:36:33.031 --> 01:36:36.470
<v Speaker 1>lexical better a thousand men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand guilty men go free than one</v>

2343
01:36:36.471 --> 01:36:39.080
<v Speaker 1>innocent man go to prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:41.450
<v Speaker 1>That right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't really like to apply that</v>

2345
01:36:41.451 --> 01:36:42.710
<v Speaker 1>to ripe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2346
01:36:42.890 --> 01:36:44.300
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>

2347
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:47.090
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those weird ones that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't look at it objectively.</v>

2348
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet maybe mobs they do now that</v>

2349
01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:53.930
<v Speaker 1>wasn't internet mobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mob justice that's in response to</v>

2350
01:36:53.931 --> 01:36:56.300
<v Speaker 1>women not finding justice through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal system.</v>

2351
01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:57.201
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were like,</v>

2352
01:36:57.201 --> 01:36:59.300
<v Speaker 1>well let's just fucking ruined his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's call his mom,</v>

2353
01:36:59.301 --> 01:37:01.460
<v Speaker 1>let's do these things and get really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck up his life.</v>

2354
01:37:01.850 --> 01:37:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that's true too.</v>

2355
01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2356
01:37:05.210 --> 01:37:07.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that people have done horrible</v>

2357
01:37:07.401 --> 01:37:08.920
<v Speaker 1>shit and gotten away with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2358
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:10.790
<v Speaker 1>So then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let's you know,</v>

2359
01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.220
<v Speaker 1>and there might be an occasional like</v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent man or,</v>

2360
01:37:13.230 --> 01:37:15.230
<v Speaker 1>or or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or North Carolina Lacrosse team.</v>

2361
01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Duke Lacrosse team is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the rape is bad on,</v>

2362
01:37:18.311 --> 01:37:22.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm bringing that up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is there anything on her on her side</v>

2363
01:37:22.161 --> 01:37:24.530
<v Speaker 1>about like you signed a bad contract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

2364
01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Like you should maybe like at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of it,</v>

2365
01:37:27.141 --> 01:37:28.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

2366
01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the contract has anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with her getting raped.</v>

2367
01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:33.200
<v Speaker 1>I think if she could do it that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what she's doing and miss cause she</v>

2368
01:37:33.201 --> 01:37:35.690
<v Speaker 1>can't supposedly make music because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the contracts.</v>

2369
01:37:35.691 --> 01:37:37.880
<v Speaker 1>You guys with that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why her career's supposedly</v>

2370
01:37:37.881 --> 01:37:38.910
<v Speaker 1>ruined right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2371
01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Well because the record industry has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long history of that just bearing</v>

2372
01:37:41.781 --> 01:37:42.920
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2373
01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:45.800
<v Speaker 1>But hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already kind of covered this.</v>

2374
01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:48.260
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she can't leave and make music because</v>

2375
01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:51.170
<v Speaker 1>he has run the contract even though she</v>
<v Speaker 1>says he raped her.</v>

2376
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I thought she or interpretation I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was saying that she</v>

2377
01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:00.510
<v Speaker 3>was raped in order to probably get out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this contract to break the contract.</v>

2378
01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:03.870
<v Speaker 3>She was raped to break the contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's saying she was raped in order to</v>

2379
01:38:03.871 --> 01:38:07.080
<v Speaker 3>get away from this guy who has been the</v>
<v Speaker 3>accusation.</v>

2380
01:38:07.090 --> 01:38:07.680
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2381
01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:09.010
<v Speaker 3>And I'm just saying like,</v>

2382
01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:11.160
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2383
01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:12.960
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that you shouldn't be bringing up</v>

2384
01:38:12.961 --> 01:38:13.770
<v Speaker 3>the rape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she's,</v>

2385
01:38:13.770 --> 01:38:16.290
<v Speaker 3>if she's making it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this would be a good thing to make up to</v>

2386
01:38:16.291 --> 01:38:18.060
<v Speaker 3>get you out of a contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of,</v>

2387
01:38:18.061 --> 01:38:20.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean honestly,</v>

2388
01:38:20.041 --> 01:38:22.470
<v Speaker 3>if you had an eight and eight contract</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the UFC,</v>

2389
01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:24.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then some other company offered you</v>

2390
01:38:24.841 --> 01:38:26.990
<v Speaker 3>50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a fight when you go to six flags</v>

2391
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.070
<v Speaker 3>contract and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you got to pretend you got raped.</v>

2392
01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:30.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would work.</v>

2393
01:38:30.370 --> 01:38:31.880
<v Speaker 3>That's why I just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you say?</v>

2394
01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:32.840
<v Speaker 3>What do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2395
01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:34.810
<v Speaker 3>how dare you not let him go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how,</v>

2396
01:38:34.811 --> 01:38:36.180
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't know what it is you would say to</v>

2397
01:38:36.181 --> 01:38:38.820
<v Speaker 3>get out of your contract,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you'd have to make up something to</v>

2398
01:38:38.821 --> 01:38:41.550
<v Speaker 3>get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not that I'm saying she his side assess,</v>

2399
01:38:41.650 --> 01:38:44.280
<v Speaker 3>sort of asking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm asking.</v>

2400
01:38:44.281 --> 01:38:45.210
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2401
01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:46.930
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2402
01:38:46.930 --> 01:38:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

2403
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:49.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2404
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.670
<v Speaker 3>I didn't mean it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought was such an electric</v>

2405
01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:55.290
<v Speaker 3>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say like one word wrong.</v>

2406
01:38:55.291 --> 01:38:55.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

2407
01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:56.593
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait.</v>

2408
01:38:57.320 --> 01:39:01.250
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible that either one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them could not be telling the truth.</v>

2409
01:39:01.251 --> 01:39:01.940
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2410
01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:03.020
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know her.</v>

2411
01:39:03.021 --> 01:39:05.030
<v Speaker 1>I've never even heard her voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never heard her talk.</v>

2412
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't have know anything about her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all I'm,</v>

2413
01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:12.110
<v Speaker 1>all I'm seeing is that she went to court</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tried to get free and they wouldn't</v>

2414
01:39:12.111 --> 01:39:15.560
<v Speaker 1>let her free and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy still wandering around.</v>

2415
01:39:15.561 --> 01:39:18.530
<v Speaker 1>So they're not prosecuting him for any</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of sexual offense.</v>

2416
01:39:18.531 --> 01:39:19.110
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2417
01:39:19.110 --> 01:39:20.050
<v Speaker 3>As far as I've read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2418
01:39:20.051 --> 01:39:22.470
<v Speaker 3>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we signed a contract to sign one,</v>

2419
01:39:22.471 --> 01:39:23.304
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or No.</v>

2420
01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:24.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

2421
01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:27.700
<v Speaker 1>he's obviously got some sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>contract with her and that's,</v>

2422
01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.950
<v Speaker 1>but see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another thing,</v>

2423
01:39:30.070 --> 01:39:33.730
<v Speaker 1>if I had a contract with someone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they falsely accused me of rape,</v>

2424
01:39:33.970 --> 01:39:36.340
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd fucking let them go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to watch it.</v>

2425
01:39:36.341 --> 01:39:38.540
<v Speaker 1>And what would it be tied into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>contract with them.</v>

2426
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:42.400
<v Speaker 1>But if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of if in any way,</v>

2427
01:39:42.401 --> 01:39:45.490
<v Speaker 1>shape or form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's telling the truth of forcing her</v>

2428
01:39:45.491 --> 01:39:46.930
<v Speaker 1>to work with somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's horrible.</v>

2429
01:39:46.990 --> 01:39:47.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2430
01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:50.590
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what the judge was doing.</v>

2431
01:39:50.591 --> 01:39:51.850
<v Speaker 1>The judge is just ruling on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>

2432
01:39:51.851 --> 01:39:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Law contracts are fucking weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like think of it as a comic.</v>

2433
01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Think of like you as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what have you had a contract to do</v>

2434
01:39:59.321 --> 01:40:03.300
<v Speaker 1>your stand up and like you had some guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months in front.</v>

2435
01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:07.990
<v Speaker 1>It was like a producer that made you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the road and you had a pact with him</v>

2436
01:40:07.991 --> 01:40:10.720
<v Speaker 1>and he made you do his jokes and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

2437
01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:13.870
<v Speaker 1>he would help you write your act and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do comedy without them.</v>

2438
01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:18.250
<v Speaker 1>I would just stop doing competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2439
01:40:18.370 --> 01:40:20.260
<v Speaker 1>That in the music business happens all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

2440
01:40:20.261 --> 01:40:23.170
<v Speaker 1>That was the prince thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why Gerad turned down a new girl.</v>

2441
01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:25.480
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Draw comical.</v>

2442
01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:27.800
<v Speaker 1>What's new girl?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was that show new girl with a</v>

2443
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:31.570
<v Speaker 1>whatever his name is Zoe deschanel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who that is.</v>

2444
01:40:31.630 --> 01:40:34.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like a spin on fussing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're acting like you're not giving me</v>

2445
01:40:34.631 --> 01:40:35.830
<v Speaker 1>enough information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show you,</v>

2446
01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:37.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're fucking talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And then they really liked him and then</v>

<v Speaker 1>he just disappeared because he saw a</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven year contract and he was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>There was some,</v>

2470
01:41:28.571 --> 01:41:30.580
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some episodes where it was just</v>

2471
01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:32.860
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you feel like you're supposed to have</v>

<v Speaker 1>to do it or something?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like feel like a whore.</v>

2474
01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:39.070
<v Speaker 1>you feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2475
01:41:39.071 --> 01:41:41.590
<v Speaker 1>you just feel gross when you say these</v>
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>

2476
01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know they're bad and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the show is bad and you know that</v>

2477
01:41:45.671 --> 01:41:46.504
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2478
01:41:46.510 --> 01:41:51.260
<v Speaker 1>the exact opposite of the way you feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing stand up at a club or</v>

2479
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:52.030
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2481
01:41:53.171 --> 01:41:56.470
<v Speaker 1>club?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're doing your best and it doesn't</v>

2482
01:41:56.471 --> 01:41:57.430
<v Speaker 1>work out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least,</v>

2483
01:41:57.431 --> 01:41:58.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could fix it and you could figure it</v>

2484
01:41:58.921 --> 01:41:59.830
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to make it funny again,</v>

2485
01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.920
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing these shows and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

2486
01:42:02.921 --> 01:42:06.760
<v Speaker 1>They tell you it's good and they make</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep going and so you're doing this.</v>

2487
01:42:06.761 --> 01:42:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll put a billboard up there and</v>

2488
01:42:08.621 --> 01:42:09.400
<v Speaker 1>they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show you where the,</v>

2489
01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:10.960
<v Speaker 1>they've raised in the ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2490
01:42:10.961 --> 01:42:12.550
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who cares?</v>

2491
01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:15.290
<v Speaker 1>I had to work with kids and work with</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid.</v>

2492
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:18.880
<v Speaker 1>He was on the set and she had no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was fine.</v>

2493
01:42:19.150 --> 01:42:21.610
<v Speaker 1>What my point was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a barrel.</v>

2494
01:42:21.930 --> 01:42:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Nice kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck her.</v>

2495
01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:25.810
<v Speaker 1>He's a nice boy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a nice young fellow and a nice</v>

2496
01:42:25.811 --> 01:42:28.660
<v Speaker 1>young girl that were on the show and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>time they were very fine,</v>

2497
01:42:29.430 --> 01:42:31.360
<v Speaker 1>fine folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my point being,</v>

2498
01:42:31.361 --> 01:42:34.240
<v Speaker 1>they were really young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had tutors and shit and they could</v>

2499
01:42:34.241 --> 01:42:36.580
<v Speaker 1>only work a certain hour amount of hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the day.</v>

2500
01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.880
<v Speaker 1>What you expose your child to that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I had a conversation with one of</v>

2501
01:42:39.881 --> 01:42:40.690
<v Speaker 1>them about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2502
01:42:40.690 --> 01:42:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was just trying to figure out</v>

2503
01:42:43.481 --> 01:42:45.400
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the idea behind it and they,</v>

2504
01:42:45.401 --> 01:42:47.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were kind of saying got to strike</v>

2505
01:42:47.711 --> 01:42:50.680
<v Speaker 1>while the iron is hot and when it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2506
01:42:50.681 --> 01:42:53.980
<v Speaker 1>you have an opportunity right now to</v>
<v Speaker 1>secure a lot of money and okay.</v>

2507
01:42:53.981 --> 01:42:56.020
<v Speaker 1>That's for their Hollywood career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2508
01:42:56.180 --> 01:43:00.940
<v Speaker 1>And like them as children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as human beings who that's just another</v>

2509
01:43:00.941 --> 01:43:02.710
<v Speaker 1>of 50 industries you can work in.</v>

2510
01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2511
01:43:03.730 --> 01:43:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Why you fucking up like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2512
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:10.360
<v Speaker 1>chances are you'll barely ever book</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything and you'll just get filled with</v>

2513
01:43:10.361 --> 01:43:11.800
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Mommy's not proud of me.</v>

2514
01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:13.510
<v Speaker 1>She couldn't take me to the things I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't book.</v>

2515
01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

2516
01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:17.380
<v Speaker 1>if they've booked two out of 50 things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's still really high percentage,</v>

2517
01:43:17.410 --> 01:43:19.060
<v Speaker 1>which is you're getting rejected 48</v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

2518
01:43:19.090 --> 01:43:22.270
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people don't get to things.</v>

2519
01:43:22.570 --> 01:43:24.400
<v Speaker 1>So constant rejection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2520
01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:26.470
<v Speaker 1>and then if you get it like finally I</v>
<v Speaker 1>get their love,</v>

2521
01:43:27.650 --> 01:43:28.540
<v Speaker 1>that's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what?</v>

2522
01:43:28.541 --> 01:43:30.310
<v Speaker 1>And then what if you book everything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you nail stuff?</v>

2523
01:43:30.730 --> 01:43:32.360
<v Speaker 1>What's the best case scenario that way</v>

01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.210
<v Speaker 1>what is the best case scenario and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>else?</v>

2525

<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

2557
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:02.720
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of like stress in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>early years,</v>

2562
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:16.190
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also there's like a certain amount of</v>

01:45:16.191 --> 01:45:19.660
<v Speaker 1>appreciation for whatever success you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>attain because you're always going to</v>

<v Speaker 1>not saying it's not possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go against you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>wheat in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on and it was fucking</v>

<v Speaker 1>pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you drink a whole glass of it and you</v>

2619
01:47:42.570 --> 01:47:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Now we that we didn't understand that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a different drug yet.</v>

2620
01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I was five years before that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>most people don't understand how I</v>

2623

<v Speaker 1>you know something as small ones like</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2664
01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I was okay for my story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It halfway through and then it was like,</v>

2665
01:49:07.981 --> 01:49:09.720
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever have one of those lows?</v>

2666
01:49:09.721 --> 01:49:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Harmane states gummies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gummy bears go start models.</v>

2667
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go me from Montrose.</v>

2668
01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Those gummy bears are fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be illegal to those guys</v>

2669
01:49:18.241 --> 01:49:20.760
<v Speaker 1>come to the punchline and stuff like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to smoke.</v>

2670
01:49:20.761 --> 01:49:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're just,</v>

2671
01:49:22.320 --> 01:49:26.610
<v Speaker 1>you just see a fire going carry torches</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the regular.</v>

2672
01:49:27.090 --> 01:49:32.090
<v Speaker 1>That's your like car pipe full towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant once more before the UFC the other</v>

2673
01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:35.030
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But James,</v>

2674
01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:37.830
<v Speaker 1>you apparently beat Jamie apparently</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't feel it.</v>

2675
01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't affect me.</v>

2676
01:49:39.590 --> 01:49:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Thin people know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's my theory,</v>

2677
01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:45.780
<v Speaker 1>because I've heard this a lot a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>times is people with really low fat.</v>

2678
01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:49.450
<v Speaker 1>It binds to fat if they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything for it to bind on.</v>

2679
01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:51.120
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2680
01:49:51.420 --> 01:49:53.350
<v Speaker 1>The people I've seen lower fat than me</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

2681
01:49:53.351 --> 01:49:54.184
<v Speaker 1>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2682
01:49:54.970 --> 01:49:56.190
<v Speaker 1>he's meaty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2683
01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:57.400
<v Speaker 1>that's muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not fat.</v>

2684
01:49:57.460 --> 01:49:58.810
<v Speaker 1>There's fat in there though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

2685
01:49:58.811 --> 01:50:00.280
<v Speaker 1>son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shredded.</v>

2686
01:50:02.020 --> 01:50:04.810
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2687
01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:06.773
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good point.</v>

2688
01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:10.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm not lighter than I've ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure where one 90 well,</v>

2689
01:50:10.730 --> 01:50:12.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm lighter than I'd been in a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

2690
01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:16.970
<v Speaker 1>which means I have lower costs more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and I'm so much fatter than look at</v>

2691
01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:18.330
<v Speaker 1>chimpanzee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2692
01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:23.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm short and fucked up looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a muscle filled with helium.</v>

2693
01:50:23.590 --> 01:50:27.160
<v Speaker 1>It's just thick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just all bones and muscle,</v>

2694
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:29.140
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my point being,</v>

2695
01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:31.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get blasted.</v>

2696
01:50:32.110 --> 01:50:32.943
<v Speaker 1>Like when I eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

2697
01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:35.920
<v Speaker 1>it does nothing to do with body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't change with me back.</v>

2698
01:50:35.950 --> 01:50:36.840
<v Speaker 1>But smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fatty,</v>

2699
01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:37.511
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

2700
01:50:37.511 --> 01:50:39.100
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess much fatty foods,</v>

2701
01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:41.010
<v Speaker 1>people I've seen that happen to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't,</v>

2702
01:50:41.011 --> 01:50:42.850
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't hit him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always real thin,</v>

2703
01:50:42.851 --> 01:50:45.130
<v Speaker 1>real small people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're talking about like fatty</v>

2704
01:50:45.131 --> 01:50:46.840
<v Speaker 1>foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think of fatty foods like things</v>

2705
01:50:46.841 --> 01:50:50.650
<v Speaker 1>that make you fat or fat itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat more fat.</v>

2706
01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't make you fat.</v>

2707
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Your body starts burning that fat to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it.</v>

2708
01:50:55.330 --> 01:50:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I know sometimes when you eat a slice of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pizza after you get high,</v>

2709
01:50:57.730 --> 01:51:00.130
<v Speaker 1>it kicks it up again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2710
01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:01.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2711
01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Did they sound like mangoes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oranges?</v>

2712
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.510
<v Speaker 1>People used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to drink orange juice,</v>

2713
01:51:05.511 --> 01:51:07.330
<v Speaker 1>so it's for acid or mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing.</v>

2714
01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:08.171
<v Speaker 1>Same thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

2715
01:51:08.171 --> 01:51:10.810
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a god.</v>

01:51:10.811 --> 01:51:14.230
<v Speaker 1>I want to say mangoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like someone said that mangoes enhance</v>

<v Speaker 1>Increase the effects of consuming</v>

2722
01:51:28.271 --> 01:51:29.960

<v Speaker 1>Pussy Ari wants candy and more pot.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What got the candy?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watts?</v>

2727
01:51:48.170 --> 01:51:49.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's reversed it already.</v>

2728
01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:52.270
<v Speaker 1>But he told his doctors and lethargic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whenever he goes,</v>

2729
01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I know what that is.</v>

2730
01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:55.390
<v Speaker 1>And he said he got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not from candy,</v>

2731
01:51:55.391 --> 01:51:57.760
<v Speaker 1>he eats a lot of candy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from those a tortilla shells and</v>

2732
01:51:57.761 --> 01:52:00.910
<v Speaker 1>shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what turned to fat pizza,</v>

2733
01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:04.540
<v Speaker 1>stuff that turns to sugar in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's just eating way too many carbs.</v>

2734
01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sugar and cart ride.</v>

2735
01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:08.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Sam Harris,</v>

2736
01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:11.650
<v Speaker 1>the neuroscientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist character.</v>

2737
01:52:11.710 --> 01:52:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Really great podcast guest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He um,</v>

2738
01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:19.680
<v Speaker 1>went vegan and his blood lipids are all</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up because he's consuming so many</v>

2739
01:52:19.721 --> 01:52:22.180
<v Speaker 1>carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like somebody pastas and breads and</v>

2740
01:52:22.181 --> 01:52:25.630
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of breaks it down and in</v>

2741
01:52:25.631 --> 01:52:26.620
<v Speaker 1>his body to sugar.</v>

2742
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:30.610
<v Speaker 1>So if he looks up your blood lipids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be real careful with that.</v>

2743
01:52:30.820 --> 01:52:32.390
<v Speaker 1>If you're gonna do like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>

2744
01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:34.720
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're gonna do like a carbohydrate</v>

2745
01:52:34.721 --> 01:52:38.080
<v Speaker 1>rich diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really got to mix up a lot of green</v>

2746
01:52:38.081 --> 01:52:40.630
<v Speaker 1>leafy vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're going to get fats,</v>

2747
01:52:40.670 --> 01:52:45.010
<v Speaker 1>you should get them from like you got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use like coconut oil and coconut butter</v>

2748
01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:46.670
<v Speaker 1>and things along those lines to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

2749
01:52:47.020 --> 01:52:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to try to stop eating as</v>

2750
01:52:48.531 --> 01:52:49.970
<v Speaker 1>much candy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't eat candy.</v>

2751
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:53.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't need any sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat any sugar unless it's like</v>

2752
01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:59.220
<v Speaker 1>ribs less than something like less than</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain basting on ribs kind of sugar.</v>

2753
01:53:00.491 --> 01:53:01.101
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

2754
01:53:01.101 --> 01:53:03.930
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does count count,</v>

2755
01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:07.280
<v Speaker 1>but it does in the way your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>processes food.</v>

2756
01:53:07.281 --> 01:53:10.340
<v Speaker 1>That's where it gets winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly meat than candy.</v>

2757
01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't matter.</v>

2758
01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Your body doesn't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly Meat Shit.</v>

2759
01:53:14.450 --> 01:53:15.500
<v Speaker 1>Your body knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2760
01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:19.280
<v Speaker 1>I just took in 51 grams of sugar from</v>
<v Speaker 1>barbecue sauce.</v>

2761
01:53:19.670 --> 01:53:21.050
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A matter of fact,</v>

2762
01:53:21.051 --> 01:53:24.380
<v Speaker 1>your body doesn't know when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking in sugar from fruit.</v>

2763
01:53:24.770 --> 01:53:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I can take it binds with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the fiber that's in the,</v>

2764
01:53:27.470 --> 01:53:29.180
<v Speaker 1>if your actual fruit helps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you eat it,</v>

2765
01:53:29.210 --> 01:53:30.980
<v Speaker 1>but if you're drinking like orange</v>
<v Speaker 1>juice,</v>

2766
01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:34.700
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar is the same as sugar from Coca</v>

2767
01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:35.533
<v Speaker 1>Cola.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

2768
01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Your body doesn't know what the fuck it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2769
01:53:38.630 --> 01:53:42.350
<v Speaker 1>If you drink a good giant ass 20 ounce</v>
<v Speaker 1>glass of orange juice,</v>

2770
01:53:42.620 --> 01:53:46.670
<v Speaker 1>your body's just simply not designed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that much sugar come out of an</v>

2771
01:53:46.671 --> 01:53:50.810
<v Speaker 1>orange like that's like fucking nine</v>
<v Speaker 1>oranges with no fiber.</v>

2772
01:53:51.380 --> 01:53:53.750
<v Speaker 1>So wax your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was probably better for you cause he's</v>

2773
01:53:53.751 --> 01:53:56.660
<v Speaker 1>all vitamin seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no caffeine and he's probably</v>

2774
01:53:56.661 --> 01:53:59.330
<v Speaker 1>better for you than a 20 ounce Coca</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cola.</v>

2775
01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:03.350
<v Speaker 1>But the sugar amount process doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter if it's processed or not.</v>

2776
01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:04.430
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
