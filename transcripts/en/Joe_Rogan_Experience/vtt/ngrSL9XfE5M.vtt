1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.290
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience is another lesson I learned that I have to remember</v>

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:04.501
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

3
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>I forget,</v>

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.860
<v Speaker 1>that I learned about the movie business.</v>

6
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Dave had a fucking great movie called the wrong guy.</v>

7
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.720
<v Speaker 1>And it was a great movie and we went to see it.</v>

9
00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>I think Brian Keaulana went to say it with me and we were fucking howling.</v>

10
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:18.871
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

11
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:19.441
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

12
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:20.790
<v Speaker 1>David's going to be a huge movie star.</v>

13
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:21.930
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be a huge movie.</v>

14
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.820
<v Speaker 1>And I remember watching it going like,</v>

15
00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>this is like one of the best comedies I've seen in years.</v>

16
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.020
<v Speaker 1>And then nothing.</v>

17
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Disney shelved it.</v>

19
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Well what happened was how Hollywood pictures was our distributor Disney.</v>

21
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Then they shut Hollywood pictures down in the middle of production.</v>

22
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.350
<v Speaker 1>And then when we were done,</v>

23
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>they reopened Hollywood pictures,</v>

24
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>but with the new president of Hollywood pictures and he didn't want to touch any</v>

25
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:49.020
<v Speaker 1>of this stuff so that the other guy had started and always are like that.</v>

26
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Because if it's there,</v>

27
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>if it's a failure,</v>

28
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>it's their failure.</v>

29
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 1>But if it's a success,</v>

31
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>it's the other guy success.</v>

32
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>So they just don't deal with it.</v>

33
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>So they uh,</v>

34
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>so got shelved for like five years.</v>

35
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Like they would even admit they had it,</v>

36
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.140
<v Speaker 1>so it never had a theatrical release.</v>

37
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Never got theatrical release.</v>

38
00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>So it's available on DVD,</v>

39
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:06.020
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

40
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Can't get it on amazon.com on Amazon right now.</v>

41
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.181
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

47
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.740

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy the shit out of it and I know,</v>

00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:40.081
<v Speaker 1>out and it never got,</v>

<v Speaker 1>well this is uh,</v>

67
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 1>this business is crazy.</v>

68
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Like this place just doesn't make any sense.</v>

69
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.330
<v Speaker 1>I know because we really thought we,</v>

70
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:46.710
<v Speaker 1>we were clear cause we had,</v>

72
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:46.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>the big thing was always,</v>

74
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:49.470
<v Speaker 1>well if you're doing an independent film,</v>

75
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>can you get distribution?</v>

76
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.040
<v Speaker 1>And we went into it with distribution.</v>

77
00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>We had Disney lined up in the script phase,</v>

78
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.211
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:01:57.211 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>so we had distribution line that we had produced,</v>

81
00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.883
<v Speaker 1>even had,</v>

82
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>we were even in profit in foreign sales.</v>

84
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

85
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Speaker 1>While we were shooting the movie based on a trailer.</v>

86
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

87
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>That was taken to can,</v>

88
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

89
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.541
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

90
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:10.170
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>

91
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>we had advanced sales,</v>

92
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>foreign sales that put the movie in profit while we were shooting,</v>

93
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>but they were all contingent on a US release.</v>

94
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.190
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you could get a meeting and talk to the new head guy and go,</v>

95
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.900
<v Speaker 1>oh we do.</v>

96
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

97
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>we tried it for years.</v>

98
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh thank you.</v>

99
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.640
<v Speaker 1>We'll make a big deal.</v>

100
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>We'll do press releases.</v>

101
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

102
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.380
<v Speaker 1>And Oh yeah.</v>

103
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>We tried talking to Disney for years and they just wouldn't have anything to do</v>

104
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:33.204
<v Speaker 1>with it now.</v>

105
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.253
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

106
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Other,</v>

107
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>there were other people even tried to buy it from Disney and they wouldn't sell</v>

108
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

109
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

110
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

111
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.091
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

112
00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Because of the emphasis success,</v>

113
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>then they fucked up.</v>

114
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.173
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What a creepy fucking business.</v>

117
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:46.080
<v Speaker 1>You wonder why Dave Chappelle went to Africa.</v>

118
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

121
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>and it's beautiful.</v>
