00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.690
<v Speaker 1>I also don't understand why it is automatically the guy's fault if it's.</v>

3
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.190
<v Speaker 1>If it's consensual.</v>

4
00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:11.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about someone being incapacitated.</v>

5
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Blackout drunk.</v>

6
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.020
<v Speaker 1>That's reasonable.</v>

7
00:00:14.021 --> 00:00:15.790
<v Speaker 1>People would see that as an as an assault,</v>

8
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.860
<v Speaker 1>but just if you're both really drunk,</v>

9
00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:19.694
<v Speaker 1>can you have sex?</v>

10
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Why is he the rapist?</v>

11
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Because that tends to be what happens on the campus.</v>

12
00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:27.250
<v Speaker 1>They do blame the young man.</v>

13
00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:28.390
<v Speaker 1>They don't say you raped each other,</v>

14
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.460
<v Speaker 1>that they will take her side.</v>

15
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.390
<v Speaker 1>If she can show they'd had drinks and I find this a.</v>

16
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>another strange thing that's happening with feminism today is that it's going</v>

17
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

18
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I call it fainting couch feminism.</v>

19
00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:44.020
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if we're going back to the Victorian era where there was delicate</v>

20
00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:48.070
<v Speaker 1>ladies preyed upon by men and as if the women aren't moral agents.</v>

21
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you take a lot of drinks a year,</v>

22
00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:55.540
<v Speaker 1>probably have made a decision to lower your inhibitions and be wild or what all</v>

23
00:00:55.541 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>kinds of things are going on that would explain that you're still an agent in</v>

24
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 1>charge of if you're,</v>

25
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.370
<v Speaker 1>yourself self mastery,</v>

27
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.900
<v Speaker 1>but they deny this of women.</v>

28
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.000
<v Speaker 1>It's all women have no agency and are constantly triggered,</v>

29
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.760
<v Speaker 1>need safe spaces at Brown university,</v>

30
00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:13.151
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

31
00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:16.030
<v Speaker 1>they had to feminists debating.</v>

32
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.740
<v Speaker 1>One of them was a libertarian,</v>

33
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.410
<v Speaker 1>a great Wendy Mackelroy,</v>

34
00:01:20.411 --> 00:01:24.340
<v Speaker 1>and she didn't believe the statistics and another was Jessica Valenti,</v>

35
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.390
<v Speaker 1>hard line feminists.</v>

36
00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:26.081
<v Speaker 1>They were debating,</v>

37
00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:26.980
<v Speaker 1>but that was fine.</v>

38
00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:27.814
<v Speaker 1>It was a debate.</v>

39
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.680
<v Speaker 1>You think that would make everyone happy?</v>

40
00:01:29.681 --> 00:01:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Both sides.</v>

41
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Well-Represented.</v>

42
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

43
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>The brown feminists were traumatized by the very idea that someone would be</v>

44
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:39.160
<v Speaker 1>invalidating our experience.</v>

45
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>They use that phrase and they ha.</v>

46
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.640
<v Speaker 1>They formed a safe room,</v>

47
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.370
<v Speaker 1>a safe space where you could go,</v>

48
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.880
<v Speaker 1>which had videotapes are frolicking puppies,</v>

49
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.020
<v Speaker 1>coloring books,</v>

50
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.033
<v Speaker 1>bubbles,</v>

51
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.600
<v Speaker 1>stuffed animals,</v>

52
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.190
<v Speaker 1>and this was described in the New York Times,</v>

53
00:01:57.191 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 1>but it was a cover story in the New York Times magazine by July.</v>

54
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Judith Shula visits and this was the safe space and if you read it and you're,</v>

55
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.050
<v Speaker 1>you're astonished that the of the infantilization puppies,</v>

56
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.423
<v Speaker 1>puppies</v>

57
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.050
<v Speaker 1>frolicking puppies,</v>

58
00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:16.000
<v Speaker 1>say bubbles.</v>

59
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.930
<v Speaker 1>Coloring books.</v>

60
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

61
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.950
<v Speaker 1>It's kindergarten for college girls.</v>

62
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.990
<v Speaker 2>It hurts my brain.</v>

63
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.861
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

64
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 2>this speaks to how people have a hard time accepting some of this new</v>

65
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:27.841
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

66
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who was a scientist and a the last time you were on,</v>

67
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 2>she said to me,</v>

68
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 2>did you have a climate denier on your show,</v>

69
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 2>a climate change denier?</v>

70
00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 2>And I say that he's definitely not denying it,</v>

71
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 2>but some people,</v>

72
00:02:43.351 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 2>that's all they hear.</v>

73
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:49.431
<v Speaker 2>When you bring forth a a non mainstream point of view or a controversial</v>

74
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:52.171
<v Speaker 2>perspective,</v>

75
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 2>instead of considering the possibility,</v>

76
00:02:55.111 --> 00:02:58.830
<v Speaker 2>it almost immediately gets dismissed as this climate change thing is another</v>

77
00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 2>ideological struggle.</v>

78
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

79
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.341
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

80
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 3>Climate change is taking place,</v>

81
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:02.940
<v Speaker 3>but what are the causes for this?</v>

82
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 3>Are we so sure that it's all caused by human beings?</v>

83
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 3>I would say there's very good reason for humanity to clean up our act in lots of</v>

84
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 3>ways.</v>

85
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 3>Regardless of the issue of climate change.</v>

86
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:13.890
<v Speaker 3>We're living,</v>

87
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 3>we're abusing mother earth.</v>

88
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 3>We're living upon this planet,</v>

89
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 3>parasites and destroying it.</v>

90
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.800
<v Speaker 3>We thoughtlessly create this gigantic pools of,</v>

91
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 3>of pollution.</v>

92
00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 3>We're crazy enough,</v>

93
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 3>insane enough to actually invent nuclear weapons and you know,</v>

94
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.100
<v Speaker 3>long periods of the detonate that bloody things you,</v>

95
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.491
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

96
00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

97
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 3>this is the lots about our behavior that we need to fix because it's right to</v>

98
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 3>fix it philosophically,</v>

99
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

100
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 3>We should not behave that way.</v>

101
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 3>We should not behave that way to one another.</v>

102
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 3>We should not behave that way to planet earth.</v>

103
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 3>But to say that we need to fix our behavior because of global warming.</v>

104
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 3>That's an ideological argument and that argument remains to be properly tested.</v>

105
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.051
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

106
00:03:53.051 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 3>global warming is occurring,</v>

107
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 3>but are we the cause of it or is something else,</v>

108
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

109
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.140
<v Speaker 3>some grander scale cosmic effect involved in this?</v>

110
00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.900
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

111
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.560
<v Speaker 4>we talked about that considerably and I noticed in a lot of the comments from,</v>

112
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.790
<v Speaker 4>from our last discussion,</v>

113
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.160
<v Speaker 4>most of the critical comments where people,</v>

114
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.713
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

115
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.070
<v Speaker 4>not liking the idea that I had questioned the dogma of global warming,</v>

116
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.850
<v Speaker 4>but there are some facts that you can't escape the global warming.</v>

117
00:04:17.851 --> 00:04:18.120
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

118
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.020
<v Speaker 4>200 years ago,</v>

119
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.160
<v Speaker 4>and we see that the glaciers from the little ice age began to shrink back in the</v>

120
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.170
<v Speaker 4>early 19th century before there was a century before there was any significant</v>

121
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.800
<v Speaker 4>human contract contribution of Sio two to the atmosphere.</v>

122
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.670
<v Speaker 4>So something was driving that warming that began,</v>

123
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.590
<v Speaker 4>and it's important to realize that the little ice age was probably the coldest</v>

124
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.070
<v Speaker 4>period since the end of the great ice age.</v>

125
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.173
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

126
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.590
<v Speaker 4>the data overwhelmingly supports that and that the glaciers grew to the largest</v>

127
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:51.990
<v Speaker 4>extent around the planet and 10,000 years.</v>

128
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.330
<v Speaker 4>So when we're talking about glacier recession,</v>

129
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:57.240
<v Speaker 4>it's important to understand what the baseline is.</v>

130
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.430
<v Speaker 4>Our baseline in this case is the biggest.</v>

131
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:01.290
<v Speaker 4>The glaciers have been in 10,000 years.</v>

132
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.430
<v Speaker 4>And what's interesting,</v>

133
00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:05.370
<v Speaker 4>and this is going on right now as the glaciers have been,</v>

134
00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:06.204
<v Speaker 4>receding.</v>

135
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.360
<v Speaker 4>Geologists and biologists and and glaciologists and so forth have been studying</v>

136
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.830
<v Speaker 4>the landscapes that are being revealed as the ice shrinks back and you know,</v>

137
00:05:16.831 --> 00:05:21.831
<v Speaker 4>what they're finding is the remains of forests that had been overrun by the</v>

138
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.640
<v Speaker 4>Little Ice Age glaciers up,</v>

139
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

140
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.780
<v Speaker 4>and and,</v>

141
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.760
<v Speaker 4>and peat bogs and things that would suggest that prior to the onset of the</v>

142
00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:30.780
<v Speaker 4>little ice age,</v>

143
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.050
<v Speaker 4>those valleys that were filled with ice from roughly 1400 to 1800 were actually</v>

144
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.360
<v Speaker 4>forested because the ice came down and overran these forests and now it's</v>

145
00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:45.810
<v Speaker 4>receding back and revealing that there were forests there.</v>

146
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.130
<v Speaker 4>So that tells you that,</v>

147
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

148
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.240
<v Speaker 4>at some point,</v>

149
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.000
<v Speaker 4>probably going back to the medieval warm period.</v>

150
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.830
<v Speaker 4>Those areas that were,</v>

151
00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.000
<v Speaker 4>that have been glaciated during the early part of the 20th century were actually</v>

152
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.183
<v Speaker 4>of ice.</v>

153
00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

154
00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

155
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 4>the climate has been extremely dynamic.</v>

156
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:05.840
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing we have to emphasize all by itself without any help from</v>

157
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:06.674
<v Speaker 4>humans.</v>

158
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.690
<v Speaker 4>And this is what I've been saying,</v>

159
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 4>is that we have to look at that and realize that,</v>

160
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

161
00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 4>humans are a factor.</v>

162
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.001
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

163
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 4>somebody I did post and said all the other factors I had mentioned as you know,</v>

164
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:22.700
<v Speaker 4>ocean currents and wind currents and geomagnetic field and cosmic rays and</v>

165
00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 4>volcanism and all that.</v>

166
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 4>It all been investigated in dismissed and the only thing left was the human</v>

167
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 4>contribution.</v>

168
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

169
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 4>to me that's really.</v>

170
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:34.760
<v Speaker 4>We're putting all our eggs in that basket and that could turn out to be very</v>

171
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:39.761
<v Speaker 4>dangerous because we're so focused now on our own contribution that we might be</v>

172
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 4>overlooking the fact that there have been natural factors driving climate change</v>

173
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.490
<v Speaker 4>over and over and over again.</v>

174
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean because I still have not heard any consensus on what has caused the</v>

175
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:56.090
<v Speaker 4>planet to first go into an ice age and come back out of an ice age.</v>

176
00:06:56.091 --> 00:07:00.520
<v Speaker 4>And I think that what Graham and I are talking about actually presents a</v>

177
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.570
<v Speaker 4>possible solution to what could have brought this planet out of the Ice Age.</v>

178
00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 4>Something on a grand cosmic scale.</v>

179
00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Speaker 4>And the other point I think I'd like to make is that we have to really to</v>

180
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:13.460
<v Speaker 4>understand our planet as a system.</v>

181
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 4>We have to realize that it's part of a cosmic ecosystem and the cosmos has been</v>

182
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.260
<v Speaker 4>a much bigger player in what's been going on down here then has been previously</v>

183
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 4>understood or appreciated.</v>

184
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:25.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
