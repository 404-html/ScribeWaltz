1
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:01.681
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:02.660
<v Speaker 1>We're alive.</v>

3
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:03.573
<v Speaker 1>What's up dude?</v>

4
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing fantastic referendums,</v>

5
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:06.061
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen.</v>

6
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:06.790
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

7
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:07.931
<v Speaker 1>Hey Buddy.</v>

9
00:00:07.931 --> 00:00:08.201
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

10
00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>a meeting.</v>

11
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.250
<v Speaker 1>If you told me six,</v>

12
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>seven years ago that I was going to be on the Joe Rogan podcast or the Joe Rogan</v>

13
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>show out,</v>

14
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>I told you no way in hell.</v>

15
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:19.081
<v Speaker 1>it didn't exist.</v>

17
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:20.170
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

18
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.290
<v Speaker 1>you go to Colorado.</v>

19
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to find me.</v>

20
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.081
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to go,</v>

21
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:25.441
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

22
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I got an idea.</v>

23
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.640
<v Speaker 1>There's this thing called podcasting.</v>

25
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>You're going to love it,</v>

26
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>but there's no way I would've thought I would be doing this either six,</v>

27
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:34.321
<v Speaker 1>seven years ago.</v>

28
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 1>So we're in the same boat.</v>

29
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.151
<v Speaker 1>Love it,</v>

30
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

31
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.781
<v Speaker 1>There you go,</v>

32
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:37.614
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

33
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.030
<v Speaker 1>And now did you like we were talking to Pacquiao,</v>

34
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Mayweather fight before we,</v>

35
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:42.890
<v Speaker 1>before we came on air.</v>

36
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:43.723
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

37
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 1>did you actually watch it?</v>

38
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

39
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

40
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I watched it as a fight guy.</v>

41
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.420
<v Speaker 1>What a,</v>

42
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.370
<v Speaker 1>what were your thoughts on it?</v>

43
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've covered this already,</v>

44
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sorry if you're going to make you repeat things,</v>

45
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in the minority.</v>

47
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>I actually enjoyed it.</v>

48
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.260
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

49
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

50
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.640
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed it from like a technical standpoint and if like two guys who are the</v>

51
00:01:02.131 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Speaker 1>best in the world trying to figure each other out.</v>

52
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>And now do you think that as a guy that knows the fight game,</v>

54
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>you can respect defense more than your average fight fan?</v>

55
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.950
<v Speaker 1>We'll definitely more than my wife.</v>

56
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.031
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

57
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>She was saying some retarded shit.</v>

58
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>

59
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.490
<v Speaker 1>she was saying you should have to get knocked down in order to win.</v>

60
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.241
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

61
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

62
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:22.801
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

63
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Speaker 1>that's that way it would at least be exciting.</v>

64
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>So like make them go for guaranteed concussion,</v>

65
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.300
<v Speaker 1>satellite Charon,</v>

66
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>shit like that.</v>

67
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.260
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

68
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>so ridiculous.</v>

69
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like hearing like some people like I kinda get it.</v>

70
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>She's not a fight fan like silver,</v>

71
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:37.861
<v Speaker 1>her watching it,</v>

72
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:39.100
<v Speaker 1>it's just boring as fuck.</v>

73
00:01:39.101 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>Cause just two dudes not hitting each other.</v>

74
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>And then when one dude gets close to the do,</v>

75
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Speaker 1>grabs him,</v>

76
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.740
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

77
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

79
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

81
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 1>I love watching hockey on TV.</v>

82
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>That's like my favorite sport to watch on TV.</v>

83
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.110
<v Speaker 1>And hockey is notoriously awful right on TV and people hate it on TV.</v>

84
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>I love it because I played for like five years when I was a kid.</v>

85
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.430
<v Speaker 1>So like I recognize that they're setting up plays,</v>

86
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I recognize strategies and stuff like that.</v>

87
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:08.040
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm trying to explain to people and there's like this is stupid or not</v>

88
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:08.431
<v Speaker 1>scoring,</v>

89
00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 1>I can't follow the puck and I'm trying to like,</v>

90
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to tell them the ins and outs of it and I'm sure the fight game is</v>

91
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:15.930
<v Speaker 1>like that for you.</v>

92
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Do they still have that thing where they follow the puck like a with a circle or</v>

93
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.450
<v Speaker 1>they try them for a while.</v>

94
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>Not that on Fox it was like,</v>

95
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:24.240
<v Speaker 1>and it turns slap shots into a comet.</v>

96
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Like it.</v>

97
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Like it just had this like red trail behind it.</v>

98
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.621
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

99
00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:29.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

100
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:29.904
<v Speaker 1>And like it was,</v>

101
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>it was supposed to get like the casual fan into it,</v>

102
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's like no one is going to hate hockey and then see a comet trail on the</v>

103
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:38.671
<v Speaker 1>puck and go,</v>

104
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>well now I'm in,</v>

105
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>I got this now.</v>

106
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.611
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

107
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:43.920
<v Speaker 1>they've done some weird shit like that with football,</v>

108
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:44.221
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

109
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:49.221
<v Speaker 1>with graphics and all the amazing part is that I was a huge fan of the XFL.</v>

110
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.090
<v Speaker 1>If people remember the Xfl,</v>

111
00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>that was Vince Mcmahon's thing.</v>

112
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>And then a lot of the stuff that they did are,</v>

113
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Speaker 1>is now being implemented into the NFL.</v>

114
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>What kinds of stuff?</v>

115
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Like the overhead camera that is like on strings and that follows the game from</v>

116
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:05.134
<v Speaker 1>the top.</v>

117
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>That was XFL.</v>

118
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

119
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>thou,</v>

120
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>thou is XFL before,</v>

121
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

122
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.550
<v Speaker 1>trying to make a,</v>

123
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean they tried to make kickoffs more exciting until like all the concussion</v>

124
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 1>stuff came out.</v>

125
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.181
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

126
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>like there's a few things and certainly making it more,</v>

127
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Vince at least recognized that it would be more fun if there was like complex</v>

128
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>storylines and like you knew like the soap opera of it much like he did for</v>

129
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 1>wrestling.</v>

130
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>So now you see the NFL and it's the world's greatest reality show.</v>

131
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

132
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>like they follow the guys off the field and like they get into their lives and</v>

133
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>now it's what the Xfl was where like they're trying to build up rivalries and</v>

134
00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:47.500
<v Speaker 1>you know what players actually don't like each other and who slept with who his</v>

135
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>wife and things like that.</v>

136
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.181
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

137
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>the problem with getting into the NFL life,</v>

138
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>like getting into the player's life is like,</v>

139
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:58.320
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to pretend that these guys are not the savage gladiators who were</v>

140
00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 1>just smashing people every day.</v>

141
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

142
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 1>And you want them like off field to be like the sweeties like baking pies and</v>

143
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>hugging their kids.</v>

144
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:06.881
<v Speaker 1>Know.</v>

145
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't get a guy like Ray Lewis.</v>

146
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

147
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Without Him.</v>

148
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Like did you see the video of him pleading to the people of Baltimore going,</v>

149
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

150
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>violence is not the answer.</v>

151
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.221
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

152
00:04:18.221 --> 00:04:18.971
<v Speaker 1>whole life dude.</v>

153
00:04:18.971 --> 00:04:19.700
<v Speaker 1>He's so intense.</v>

154
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Like yet.</v>

155
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.501
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

156
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:21.930
<v Speaker 1>So if violence isn't the answer,</v>

157
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 1>move out of your mansion.</v>

158
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's what built the mansion was violence.</v>

159
00:04:25.871 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 1>People know who you are.</v>

160
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

161
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.180
<v Speaker 1>You're super violent.</v>

162
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

163
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.560
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>

164
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>that's like you and me saying like,</v>

165
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:31.601
<v Speaker 1>don't tell jokes.</v>

166
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

167
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Stop it wasn't he on trial for murder?</v>

168
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's been violent,</v>

169
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.930
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't really do it.</v>

170
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>It was like one of his entourage and he was an a or allegedly accessory to</v>

171
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:41.944
<v Speaker 1>murder was college.</v>

172
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.780
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of like the snoop Dogg thing,</v>

173
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

174
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

175
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

176
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Either way he's a football player.</v>

177
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

178
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 1>like when you see like these fighters are these football players and see them</v>

179
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:56.170
<v Speaker 1>doing ridiculous shit and people get all surprised.</v>

180
00:04:56.171 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't ask them to be anything other than what they really are.</v>

181
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.001
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

182
00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:02.380
<v Speaker 1>You want that result.</v>

183
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 1>You write that ray rice result,</v>

184
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get a ray rice,</v>

185
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get that happening.</v>

186
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Which is,</v>

187
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.370
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

188
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Which is not saying we condone it.</v>

189
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

190
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.150
<v Speaker 1>But it's just saying don't be surprised when it happened,</v>

191
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.741
<v Speaker 1>but you can't.</v>

192
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 1>All the sudden and 2015 start putting cameras on these guys,</v>

193
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>following him around and expecting them to have exemplary behavior.</v>

194
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 1>What they're good at is when the fucking place starts.</v>

195
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>They're good at getting shit done,</v>

196
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

197
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 1>and the way you do that is through violence,</v>

198
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 1>explosive athleticism,</v>

199
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.750
<v Speaker 1>smashing in it.</v>

200
00:05:33.751 --> 00:05:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Thanks fucking diving through mounds of enormous steroid it up,</v>

201
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:39.011
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

202
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:39.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

203
00:05:39.281 --> 00:05:43.450
<v Speaker 1>And then with so much testosterone boiling over and then when Richard Sherman</v>

204
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>gives an interview late last year or two or two years ago when he was like,</v>

205
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>what the crap she can be put on me,</v>

206
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.631
<v Speaker 1>crap,</v>

207
00:05:49.631 --> 00:05:50.464
<v Speaker 1>she's a punk.</v>

208
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Then they start getting mad at him.</v>

209
00:05:52.241 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 1>Like how?</v>

210
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.740
<v Speaker 1>How dare you talk to Erin Andrews like that?</v>

211
00:05:56.741 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

212
00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

213
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>petite white woman and you're just getting angry.</v>

214
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Why are you so angry?</v>

215
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Because he just play football for an hour.</v>

216
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 1>That's why he's angry and that's why he's good at what he does.</v>

217
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

218
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you wanted Tim to take it from 10 all the way down to one again</v>

219
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 1>and then just like come off like he's an Oscar Wylde play like,</v>

220
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:15.711
<v Speaker 1>well that's be,</v>

221
00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:16.750
<v Speaker 1>we're all in the field of battle.</v>

222
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Might I tell you it was quite an interesting route.</v>

223
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>

224
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not going to happen though those guys,</v>

225
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>those guys are going to be too intense.</v>

226
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.560
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair.</v>

227
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

228
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.250
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants everything sanitized.</v>

229
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:29.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean we want to make,</v>

230
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>we want the purity of the sport,</v>

231
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:34.760
<v Speaker 1>but then we also want it to be fan friendly.</v>

232
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 1>We also want it to be easily absorbed by the casual person who's watching it.</v>

233
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

234
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 1>And you know this because you've had to interview guys right after they fight.</v>

235
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.260
<v Speaker 1>They're fired up after they've just been punched in the face and they are,</v>

236
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 1>and that's literally the most testosterone probably that can run through your</v>

237
00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:55.090
<v Speaker 1>body in a three minute period just like getting revved up and then you,</v>

238
00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.160
<v Speaker 1>and then Joe Rogan comes in and puts a microphone and explain what happened out</v>

239
00:07:01.581 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 1>there and then you will like,</v>

240
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.290
<v Speaker 1>they expect these guys to get like a complex thing.</v>

241
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.660
<v Speaker 1>People wonder why athletes,</v>

242
00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>they get mad that they always have those textbook answers.</v>

243
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Like one game at a time.</v>

244
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I was just doing a play.</v>

245
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.160
<v Speaker 1>It played a time where you'd go back and work examine,</v>

246
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 1>they have those scripted answers so they don't have to think about giving those</v>

247
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.140
<v Speaker 1>answers because they can't in those moments.</v>

248
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:25.160
<v Speaker 1>Well not only that,</v>

249
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:28.360
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are just not that good talking on camera.</v>

250
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Like that's something you've got to get relaxed at.</v>

251
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.270
<v Speaker 1>We forget because we talk for a living and that's what our normal is.</v>

252
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Our normal is talking in front of a bunch of strangers and being funny on a</v>

253
00:07:39.081 --> 00:07:40.040
<v Speaker 1>moment's notice,</v>

254
00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.310
<v Speaker 1>rather be in an interview or a radio show or a podcast,</v>

255
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:43.581
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

256
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:43.761
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

257
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:44.090
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

258
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 1>flip the switch.</v>

259
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>

260
00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

261
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.470
<v Speaker 1>The average person does not do that.</v>

262
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Like when they have an actor give a speech at an awards show and it's like</v>

263
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 1>something crazy happens and they have to be spontaneous.</v>

264
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like no,</v>

265
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 1>they're actors.</v>

266
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times they can't do that.</v>

267
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

268
00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:01.430
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them can.</v>

269
00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:02.211
<v Speaker 1>And some of them can.</v>

270
00:08:02.211 --> 00:08:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the best interviews ever was Mickey Rourke when he won some like</v>

271
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Golden Globe or one of those fucking,</v>

272
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.493
<v Speaker 1>whatever the name of you.</v>

273
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I think all wars are stupid.</v>

274
00:08:10.671 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't pay attention to any of that shit.</v>

275
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.410
<v Speaker 1>You award far faked it better than this faker.</v>

276
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.690
<v Speaker 1>But I mean now people do great performance,</v>

277
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:18.951
<v Speaker 1>but his,</v>

278
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:19.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

279
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.160
<v Speaker 1>he did this amazing speech where he was just so loose and relaxed talking all</v>

280
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:25.400
<v Speaker 1>kinds of crazy shit.</v>

281
00:08:25.401 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>It was like one of the best speeches ever and it was,</v>

282
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:32.060
<v Speaker 1>it was fun cause he seemed like real comfortable in his own skin despite all the</v>

283
00:08:32.061 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 1>craziness of that guy has been through and yeah.</v>

284
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:35.263
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

285
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 1>It's always,</v>

286
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:39.020
<v Speaker 1>and that can go either way.</v>

287
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Like people either freak out with the honesty of that person or that were where</v>

288
00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:44.690

<v Speaker 1>is this,</v>

293
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.100

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.701
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't me.</v>

295
00:08:49.701 --> 00:08:51.590
<v Speaker 1>It was really what's really crazy too.</v>

296
00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like you see him in this video and we'll play a little bit of it and then</v>

297
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:56.970
<v Speaker 2>you see him now.</v>

298
00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Like now he looks like an old gypsy woman.</v>

299
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 2>He's got a crazy doctors face up and it's actually an image that says chips</v>

<v Speaker 2>Mickey Rourke,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

308
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.270
<v Speaker 3>I just want to say one thing about Eric Roberts.</v>

309
00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Eric Roberts is probably the best actor I've ever worked with.</v>

310
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.070
<v Speaker 3>And I don't,</v>

311
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why in the last 15 years,</v>

312
00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:26.510
<v Speaker 3>ain't nobody give him a chance to show his shit again because whatever he did</v>

313
00:09:26.511 --> 00:09:26.991
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

314
00:09:26.991 --> 00:09:28.760
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago should be forgiven.</v>

315
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.143
<v Speaker 3>And I wish,</v>

316
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.413
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

317
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:31.830
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

318
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:33.280
<v Speaker 3>God damn series about that.</v>

319
00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Eric Roberts is the fucking man.</v>

320
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.233
<v Speaker 4>Love it.</v>

321
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:38.990
<v Speaker 2>That's just one part of it.</v>

322
00:09:38.991 --> 00:09:39.610
<v Speaker 2>And he gets loose</v>

323
00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 4>slightly.</v>

324
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.141
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

325

326
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:41.931
<v Speaker 4>He didn't like,</v>

327
00:09:41.931 --> 00:09:42.651
<v Speaker 4>I like God,</v>

328
00:09:42.651 --> 00:09:43.484
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

329
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 3>he deserves a second chance.</v>

330
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.510
<v Speaker 3>And I wish there'd be one goddamn film maker in this room that would,</v>

331
00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 3>would let him fly because the man,</v>

332
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.290
<v Speaker 3>he is something else.</v>

333
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:52.681
<v Speaker 3>Thank you,</v>

334
00:09:52.681 --> 00:09:53.514
<v Speaker 3>Eric.</v>

335
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.590
<v Speaker 4>Eric will probably be arrested by the end of the day,</v>

336
00:10:00.591 --> 00:10:02.540
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.250
<v Speaker 5>The wig is crazy.</v>

438
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 5>The face is crazy.</v>

439
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.860
<v Speaker 5>It's like poor bastard pulled back so he could see his hair.</v>

440
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.290
<v Speaker 5>He's wearing this crazy hair piece.</v>

441
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:40.291
<v Speaker 5>Then is he trying to look like or an old gypsy woman or is that just no,</v>

442
00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:41.410
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

443
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:42.370
<v Speaker 5>he was at the fights.</v>

444
00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:42.740
<v Speaker 5>That was,</v>

445
00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.820
<v Speaker 5>he was at the UFC and he was upset.</v>

446
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.050
<v Speaker 5>One of the decisions and that was the face that he made,</v>

447
00:12:47.051 --> 00:12:49.300
<v Speaker 5>but he's done something to his lips.</v>

448
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:49.911
<v Speaker 5>Apparently.</v>

449
00:12:49.911 --> 00:12:50.600
<v Speaker 5>You're right.</v>

450
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.600
<v Speaker 5>He looks like the character from the Stephen King movie a thinner that Gypsy</v>

451
00:12:57.071 --> 00:12:59.970
<v Speaker 5>woman that like rubbed her hand on the face like CNN.</v>

452
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:00.880
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

453
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:01.150
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

454
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:01.983
<v Speaker 5>That's her.</v>

455
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:02.321
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

456
00:13:02.321 --> 00:13:02.471
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

457
00:13:02.471 --> 00:13:02.651
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

458
00:13:02.651 --> 00:13:03.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean him and uh,</v>

459
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:06.540
<v Speaker 5>Bruce Jenner could hang out and just talk shit.</v>

460
00:13:06.541 --> 00:13:08.080
<v Speaker 5>I think he's trying to be a woman though.</v>

461
00:13:08.081 --> 00:13:10.000
<v Speaker 5>I think now he's not going crazy.</v>

462
00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:10.901
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

463
00:13:10.901 --> 00:13:12.360
<v Speaker 5>that's what you do.</v>

464
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.810
<v Speaker 5>You think like that's what this business does to people that as they age,</v>

465
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:20.170
<v Speaker 5>whether it be Renee Zellweger or a Mickey Rourke are now,</v>

466
00:13:20.171 --> 00:13:21.640
<v Speaker 5>there's some pictures out there I think of,</v>

467
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 5>I think it's Ooma Thurman where it's like Huma Thurman's gotten,</v>

468
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.880
<v Speaker 5>I think they did some plastic surgery.</v>

469
00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.320
<v Speaker 5>I think she did some plastic surgery to her and it's just something where you're</v>

470
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:36.100
<v Speaker 5>built up has like sort of either a sex symbol or whatever for so long and then</v>

471
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:36.934
<v Speaker 5>it just goes,</v>

472
00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.760
<v Speaker 5>it starts to fade away then does that fuck with your head?</v>

473
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.441
<v Speaker 5>It would imagine,</v>

474
00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:46.441
<v Speaker 5>I mean someone described beauty as a short live tyranny and I think beauty is</v>

475
00:13:48.551 --> 00:13:53.551
<v Speaker 5>like a really hard one because some women they go from being unbelievably</v>

476
00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:56.050
<v Speaker 5>desirable and then through no fault of their own,</v>

477
00:13:56.051 --> 00:13:56.231
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

478
00:13:56.231 --> 00:13:57.700
<v Speaker 5>just father time natural agent.</v>

479
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:58.720
<v Speaker 5>They become monsters.</v>

480
00:13:58.750 --> 00:13:59.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

481
00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.180
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

482
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.570
<v Speaker 5>What's going on there?</v>

483
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.673
<v Speaker 5>She do.</v>

484
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:03.310
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

485
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.960
<v Speaker 5>she pulled my God does she do,</v>

486
00:14:04.961 --> 00:14:06.370
<v Speaker 5>she pulled some stuff back.</v>

487
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:07.840
<v Speaker 5>She doesn't look like her.</v>

488
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:08.733
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

489
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.340
<v Speaker 5>she uh,</v>

490
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.173
<v Speaker 5>she uh,</v>

491
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.400
<v Speaker 5>she looks like she's a character from that new movie.</v>

492
00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:12.810
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

493
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:13.180
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:16.450
<v Speaker 5>x Maki not done is weird man.</v>

495
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.230
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

496
00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:18.100
<v Speaker 5>So weird.</v>

497
00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:18.730
<v Speaker 5>And did she,</v>

498
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:19.630
<v Speaker 5>what did she do?</v>

499
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.110
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to figure out what she did maybe.</v>

500
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.630
<v Speaker 5>Is that just to her wearing no makeup except for lipstick?</v>

501
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:26.350
<v Speaker 5>I have,</v>

502
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:27.370
<v Speaker 5>I have no idea.</v>

503
00:14:27.371 --> 00:14:27.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm not,</v>

504
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.290
<v Speaker 5>I believe it or not,</v>

505
00:14:29.291 --> 00:14:30.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a plastic surgeon.</v>

506
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:34.270
<v Speaker 5>A lot of feeling that if you added like see like one of them has all the slips,</v>

507
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.730
<v Speaker 5>all of his eye makeup on and the other one doesn't.</v>

508
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.410
<v Speaker 5>That's a big thing with gals.</v>

509
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.170
<v Speaker 5>Like you ever see a woman who doesn't have,</v>

510
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.801
<v Speaker 5>I make Alan,</v>

511
00:14:41.801 --> 00:14:44.290
<v Speaker 5>you'd always hear with eye makeup on and then one day you don't,</v>

512
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:44.531
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

513
00:14:44.531 --> 00:14:45.070
<v Speaker 5>who are you?</v>

514
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:45.461
<v Speaker 5>Who are you?</v>

515
00:14:45.461 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

516
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.500
<v Speaker 5>You're fucking different humans.</v>

517
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:51.380
<v Speaker 5>The Huffington post and you might want to porn stars.</v>

518
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.860
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

519
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

520
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 1>The porn stars without makeup thing.</v>

521
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:54.681
<v Speaker 1>That blew my mind.</v>

522
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:57.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a trip because then you see these girls without makeup,</v>

523
00:14:57.801 --> 00:14:59.150
<v Speaker 1>like when the makeup on,</v>

524
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:01.400
<v Speaker 1>they are goddesses and you're just seeing them on the screen.</v>

525
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:01.671
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

526
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:02.504
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

527
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.950
<v Speaker 1>That's like the ideal.</v>

528
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.210
<v Speaker 1>And then you see them without the makeup.</v>

529
00:15:05.211 --> 00:15:05.480
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

530
00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:05.751
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

531
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:08.630
<v Speaker 1>I know eight girls from Riverside that looked just like that.</v>

532
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.133
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>

533
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:10.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

534
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 1>You could do some amazing shit with makeup if you're a chick.</v>

535
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

536
00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Or like there's a,</v>

537
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.940
<v Speaker 1>there was also a story about a dude.</v>

538
00:15:16.941 --> 00:15:18.080
<v Speaker 1>He's makeup artists.</v>

539
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.191
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>

540
00:15:19.191 --> 00:15:19.560
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

541
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.001
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

542
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a black guy and he showed that with makeup.</v>

543
00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:28.091
<v Speaker 1>He could look like Kim Kardashian and he put makeup on his face and at the end</v>

544
00:15:29.031 --> 00:15:29.600
<v Speaker 1>of it you're like,</v>

545
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:29.991
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

546
00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:30.830
<v Speaker 1>that let me grant.</v>

547
00:15:30.831 --> 00:15:34.010
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a madame Tussauds like wax museum,</v>

548
00:15:34.011 --> 00:15:34.844
<v Speaker 1>Kim Kardashians.</v>

549
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:35.683
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

550
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.010
<v Speaker 1>you look like that.</v>

551
00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Like you created that and then he hit his face without,</v>

552
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:41.690
<v Speaker 1>it is not like that at all.</v>

553
00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it looks or a weird thing.</v>

554
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

555
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like you didn't ask for it,</v>

556
00:15:46.131 --> 00:15:47.060
<v Speaker 1>you didn't work for it.</v>

557
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:47.630
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

558
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.470
<v Speaker 1>And just boom,</v>

559
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:49.890
<v Speaker 1>like in it,</v>

560
00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.110
<v Speaker 1>it's an old debate.</v>

561
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:55.640
<v Speaker 1>Would you rather have all the looks and then slowly lose them or would you</v>

562
00:15:55.641 --> 00:15:56.474
<v Speaker 1>rather be like,</v>

563
00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

564
00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Jason Alexander,</v>

565
00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.250
<v Speaker 1>that looks the exact same as he did 30 years ago,</v>

566
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.420
<v Speaker 1>but he's going crazy too.</v>

567
00:16:02.421 --> 00:16:03.730
<v Speaker 1>He's wearing it to pay now.</v>

568
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:04.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

569
00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Jason Alexander put it to play on.</v>

570
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:11.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like he's like a walking episode of Seinfeld sign for,</v>

571
00:16:11.311 --> 00:16:14.510
<v Speaker 1>there was an episode of Seinfeld where he wore a toupee and it was like,</v>

572
00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:15.470
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

573
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.340
<v Speaker 1>it was really awkward.</v>

574
00:16:16.341 --> 00:16:18.650
<v Speaker 1>It was really obvious and now he's kind of trying to do it.</v>

575
00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:19.251
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

576
00:16:19.251 --> 00:16:22.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't blame guys to do the,</v>

577
00:16:22.031 --> 00:16:22.461
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

578
00:16:22.461 --> 00:16:22.771
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

579
00:16:22.771 --> 00:16:22.930
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

580
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.230
<v Speaker 1>the plugs or anything like that.</v>

581
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't blame them.</v>

582
00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.071
<v Speaker 1>Hell,</v>

583
00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:26.300
<v Speaker 1>a Wayne Rooney,</v>

584
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:26.670
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

585
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:27.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

586
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:27.531
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

587
00:16:27.531 --> 00:16:28.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

588
00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.940
<v Speaker 1>soccer player did it and everyone knew that he had plugs and he's like,</v>

589
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

590
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.200
<v Speaker 1>I hear now.</v>

591
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:33.890
<v Speaker 1>I did it.</v>

592
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.830
<v Speaker 1>But you know what happens man first when you get a scar in the back of your</v>

593
00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:37.131
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

594
00:16:37.131 --> 00:16:40.760
<v Speaker 1>So I have like a permanent smile on the back of my head and then second of all,</v>

595
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 1>if the rest of your hair falls out the way I described it as like taking healthy</v>

596
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:46.700
<v Speaker 1>people and moving them into a neighborhood where everyone is dying,</v>

597
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.100
<v Speaker 1>the other hair falls out.</v>

598
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:49.963
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

599
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:52.640
<v Speaker 1>they haven't figured it out yet.</v>

600
00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Like lips,</v>

601
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:55.460
<v Speaker 1>like when girls get their lips done,</v>

602
00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.680
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be an early adopter of that.</v>

603
00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:00.440
<v Speaker 1>You don't want someone fucking with your face permanently.</v>

604
00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:00.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

605
00:17:00.721 --> 00:17:01.191
<v Speaker 1>This is the,</v>

606
00:17:01.191 --> 00:17:01.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

607
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:01.851
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

608
00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:02.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

609
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:03.060
<v Speaker 1>it was it the bill bourbon.</v>

610
00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:04.360
<v Speaker 1>It was a bill.</v>

611
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:06.530
<v Speaker 1>A bill burr is a great bit about this where he's like,</v>

612
00:17:06.531 --> 00:17:06.711
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

613
00:17:06.711 --> 00:17:08.690
<v Speaker 1>just wait until they,</v>

614
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.220
<v Speaker 1>until they fucking fix it.</v>

615
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Like wait,</v>

616
00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.110
<v Speaker 1>wait until they get it right.</v>

617
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:12.650
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

618
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.780
<v Speaker 1>like the people that are going into plastic surgery right now,</v>

619
00:17:14.781 --> 00:17:16.600
<v Speaker 1>like wait there,</v>

620
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:19.250
<v Speaker 1>they can't wait because they're 50 and they're like,</v>

621
00:17:19.251 --> 00:17:19.851
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

622
00:17:19.851 --> 00:17:20.151
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

623
00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I just want to look at 37 you know what,</v>

624
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.540
<v Speaker 1>there's like some doctors nail it though.</v>

625
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:27.100
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

626
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:27.501
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

627
00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:32.480
<v Speaker 1>the other problem is some doctors can do a really good job of making look a</v>

628
00:17:32.481 --> 00:17:33.350
<v Speaker 1>little bit better.</v>

629
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:37.700
<v Speaker 1>It's those guys that go crazy and it's also like a girl,</v>

630
00:17:37.701 --> 00:17:37.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

631
00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:38.101
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

632
00:17:38.101 --> 00:17:38.601
<v Speaker 1>my Thurman.</v>

633
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

634
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.620
<v Speaker 1>how much shopping around does she do for a plastic surgeon if she even got</v>

635
00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:45.140
<v Speaker 1>plastic surgery or the other one Renee Zellweger,</v>

636
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.260
<v Speaker 1>do they just go with someone that he could trust like that they know?</v>

637
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:49.123
<v Speaker 1>Do they ask?</v>

638
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

639
00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing is we talk about all the ones that went wrong because the</v>

640
00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:54.331
<v Speaker 1>ones that went right,</v>

641
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:55.490
<v Speaker 1>we don't know this.</v>

642
00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:56.010
<v Speaker 1>We're just like,</v>

643
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:56.150
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

644
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.910
<v Speaker 1>they look great.</v>

645
00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.050
<v Speaker 1>A ton that went right,</v>

646
00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:58.560
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

647
00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:58.861
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

648
00:17:58.861 --> 00:17:59.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who,</v>

649
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.290
<v Speaker 1>but like Christy Brown,</v>

650
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:01.411
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

651
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:02.790
<v Speaker 1>she says she never had anything done.</v>

652
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.590
<v Speaker 1>She's like 61 or something like that.</v>

653
00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:05.640
<v Speaker 1>She's still hot as fuck.</v>

654
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:05.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

655
00:18:05.911 --> 00:18:06.150
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

656
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that is.</v>

657
00:18:07.621 --> 00:18:12.621
<v Speaker 1>Or like genetics or you see a Sophia Loren,</v>

658
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.790
<v Speaker 1>he even when she was 60,</v>

659
00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:15.901
<v Speaker 1>65,</v>

660
00:18:15.901 --> 00:18:16.350
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

661
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.160
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

662
00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:17.993
<v Speaker 1>well done.</v>

663
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:18.893
<v Speaker 1>Good for you.</v>

664
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.400
<v Speaker 1>Well who is the other one?</v>

665
00:18:20.401 --> 00:18:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Raquel Welsh.</v>

666
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:25.320
<v Speaker 1>She's like deep deep into her seventies and she's still hot as fuck.</v>

667
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

668
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:26.420
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

669
00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.240
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

670
00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.050
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>

671
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:30.150
<v Speaker 1>just the genetic lottery I guess,</v>

672
00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:32.070
<v Speaker 1>or let orally that like,</v>

673
00:18:32.071 --> 00:18:32.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

674
00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:33.144
<v Speaker 1>cause hey,</v>

675
00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:33.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

676
00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.050
<v Speaker 1>some people are,</v>

677
00:18:35.051 --> 00:18:37.920
<v Speaker 1>are born and they've got like the natural like boat,</v>

678
00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:39.110
<v Speaker 1>like Bo Jackson and where,</v>

679
00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:39.871
<v Speaker 1>where they say like,</v>

680
00:18:39.871 --> 00:18:41.070
<v Speaker 1>just natural athlete,</v>

681
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.200
<v Speaker 1>like God given talent or Herschel Walker just did pushups and sit ups his entire</v>

682
00:18:46.201 --> 00:18:48.440
<v Speaker 1>damn life supposedly.</v>

683
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.430
<v Speaker 1>And then not sure I buy that.</v>

684
00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Cause he also said that he only eats like a salad and soup the whole day,</v>

685
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:55.650
<v Speaker 1>whole day,</v>

686
00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.030
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't even make any sense.</v>

687
00:18:57.031 --> 00:19:01.620
<v Speaker 1>And then he also has multiple personality disorder or trauma induced multiple</v>

688
00:19:01.621 --> 00:19:02.670
<v Speaker 1>personality disorder.</v>

689
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:06.700
<v Speaker 1>So who knows which Herschel list is a one her,</v>

690
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.570
<v Speaker 1>she might be doing roids squats.</v>

691
00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:11.990
<v Speaker 1>We mean if anybody can talk about genetic lottery,</v>

692
00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:12.790
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

693
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

694
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:13.913
<v Speaker 1>no kidding.</v>

695
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

696
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Cause I mean it could for people don't know if people aren't listening to this</v>

697
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:18.510
<v Speaker 1>are people,</v>

698
00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.980
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people were just listening to us.</v>

699
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

700
00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:21.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

701
00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.280
<v Speaker 1>explain,</v>

702
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:22.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

703
00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.160
<v Speaker 1>am a,</v>

704
00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:23.251
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

705
00:19:23.251 --> 00:19:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Chondra plastic dwarf and that's the type of dwarfism that I have.</v>

706
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.410
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

707
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

708
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.520
<v Speaker 1>cause there's over a hundred types of dwarfism.</v>

709
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

710
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:30.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

711
00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:30.811
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

712
00:19:30.811 --> 00:19:32.130
<v Speaker 1>cause it's a genetic mutation.</v>

713
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.310
<v Speaker 1>So you have slight differences in how,</v>

714
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.480
<v Speaker 1>in how the gene,</v>

715
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

716
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:37.500
<v Speaker 1>changes.</v>

717
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:40.050
<v Speaker 1>So there were literally some dwarves out.</v>

718
00:19:40.051 --> 00:19:44.370
<v Speaker 1>There's some little people that it's only like one of three people in the entire</v>

719
00:19:44.371 --> 00:19:46.590
<v Speaker 1>world that have that specific type of dwarfism.</v>

720
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:48.210
<v Speaker 1>One of three in the whole world.</v>

721
00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:48.301
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

722
00:19:48.301 --> 00:19:49.530
<v Speaker 1>what are the differentiations?</v>

723
00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

724
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:50.160
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

725
00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:50.461
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

726
00:19:50.461 --> 00:19:51.294
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

727
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.520
<v Speaker 1>a Achondroplasia is what I have.</v>

728
00:19:53.521 --> 00:19:54.990
<v Speaker 1>It's the most common type of dwarfism,</v>

729
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.153
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

730
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.110
<v Speaker 1>minus characterized by small arms,</v>

731
00:19:58.111 --> 00:19:58.891
<v Speaker 1>small legs,</v>

732
00:19:58.891 --> 00:20:00.000
<v Speaker 1>prominent buttocks.</v>

733
00:20:00.001 --> 00:20:00.834
<v Speaker 1>I love that one.</v>

734
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.943
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

735
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.140
<v Speaker 1>prominent buttocks in large forehead,</v>

736
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

737
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.000
<v Speaker 1>collapsed nose bridge,</v>

738
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

739
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:08.100
<v Speaker 1>average size torso.</v>

740
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.320
<v Speaker 1>So like when we're sitting down,</v>

741
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:11.760
<v Speaker 1>we're making eye contact right now,</v>

742
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.150
<v Speaker 1>but I'm four foot for your six.</v>

743
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.050
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

744
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:16.291
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

745
00:20:16.291 --> 00:20:16.910
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

746
00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:17.431
<v Speaker 1>you're five,</v>

747
00:20:17.431 --> 00:20:17.910
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>

748
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:18.990
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

749
00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:19.973
<v Speaker 1>But there's some,</v>

750
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.470
<v Speaker 1>there's some dwarves that have a completely different body type.</v>

751
00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

752
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.610
<v Speaker 1>like Vern Troyer who played many meeting Austin Powers movies.</v>

753
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.720
<v Speaker 1>He's got dwarfism,</v>

754
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:30.030
<v Speaker 1>but it's a completely different type of dwarfism.</v>

755
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.670
<v Speaker 1>When that guy was on celebrity,</v>

756
00:20:32.671 --> 00:20:33.570
<v Speaker 1>what was that show?</v>

757
00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

758
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.100
<v Speaker 1>a surreal life.</v>

759
00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

760
00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh that was so sad.</v>

761
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.520
<v Speaker 1>I do a perfect impression of,</v>

762
00:20:40.521 --> 00:20:40.751
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

763
00:20:40.751 --> 00:20:42.390
<v Speaker 1>of him drunk when he's,</v>

764
00:20:42.391 --> 00:20:42.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

765
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.060
<v Speaker 1>when he's a pissing in the corner,</v>

766
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.030
<v Speaker 1>he made a noise.</v>

767
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:47.381
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

768
00:20:47.381 --> 00:20:47.860
<v Speaker 1>ah.</v>

769
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.311
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

770
00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Ah.</v>

771
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Is he still alive?</v>

772
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

773
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.920
<v Speaker 1>he's still alive.</v>

774
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.440
<v Speaker 1>That guy seemed like he was drinking himself to death,</v>

775
00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:54.340
<v Speaker 1>you would think.</v>

776
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:55.503
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

777
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.021
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

778
00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:57.130
<v Speaker 1>he's still ticking man.</v>

779
00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:58.301
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

780
00:20:58.301 --> 00:20:59.134
<v Speaker 1>And he's still alive.</v>

781
00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:04.450
<v Speaker 1>It's hardcore for a guy like that too because he goes and he gets this big</v>

782
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:05.370
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>

783
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:08.230
<v Speaker 1>he becomes a celebrity like almost instantaneously.</v>

784
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:13.780
<v Speaker 1>And then after that it kind of dries up and no one wants to see him humble laser</v>

785
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:14.440
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

786
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.940
<v Speaker 1>So that what you got.</v>

787
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:17.720
<v Speaker 1>And it's weird cause I,</v>

788
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.110
<v Speaker 1>I saw that and when I was trying to into show business,</v>

789
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.230
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the reasons why I love being a standup comic.</v>

790
00:21:23.231 --> 00:21:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Cause no matter what,</v>

791
00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:29.080
<v Speaker 1>I could always go on stage and talking from an audience and be and be funny.</v>

792
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:30.010
<v Speaker 1>I can do that.</v>

793
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

794
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:34.300
<v Speaker 1>and there's only a few amount of people that can actually do that.</v>

795
00:21:34.301 --> 00:21:35.860
<v Speaker 1>So as long as I got that skill,</v>

796
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:36.581
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

797
00:21:36.581 --> 00:21:38.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to wait until the producer says,</v>

798
00:21:38.441 --> 00:21:39.010
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

799
00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll put you in a movie.</v>

800
00:21:39.941 --> 00:21:40.181
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

801
00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:41.014
<v Speaker 1>I'll put you on a TV show it.</v>

802
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:41.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

803
00:21:41.111 --> 00:21:42.430
<v Speaker 1>to answer your earlier question,</v>

804
00:21:42.431 --> 00:21:45.250
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what makes people go crazy out here.</v>

805
00:21:45.251 --> 00:21:47.410
<v Speaker 1>Like does the business do it to them?</v>

806
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:48.990
<v Speaker 1>What goes crazy is that they,</v>

807
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.200
<v Speaker 1>they're not in control,</v>

808
00:21:50.201 --> 00:21:51.070
<v Speaker 1>their own destiny.</v>

809
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.400
<v Speaker 1>So if they do have any sort of success whatsoever,</v>

810
00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:56.500
<v Speaker 1>if anything does take off for them,</v>

811
00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:57.760
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're like,</v>

812
00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:58.101
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

813
00:21:58.101 --> 00:21:58.360
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

814
00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.080
<v Speaker 1>it's happening,</v>

815
00:21:59.080 --> 00:21:59.681
<v Speaker 1>it's happening.</v>

816
00:21:59.681 --> 00:22:01.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's all out of their control,</v>

817
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

818
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:03.430
<v Speaker 1>You audition for things,</v>

819
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:04.660
<v Speaker 1>get the job,</v>

820
00:22:04.661 --> 00:22:05.800
<v Speaker 1>you're on the set.</v>

821
00:22:05.801 --> 00:22:06.191
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

822
00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:07.270
<v Speaker 1>when is this going away?</v>

823
00:22:07.271 --> 00:22:09.020
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to cultivate your career.</v>

824
00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.070
<v Speaker 1>So they have to be very careful about the things that they say and yeah,</v>

825
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.480
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

826
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.261
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

827
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:16.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's one reason.</v>

828
00:22:16.061 --> 00:22:16.631
<v Speaker 1>It's like light.</v>

829
00:22:16.631 --> 00:22:17.201
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

830
00:22:17.201 --> 00:22:18.070
<v Speaker 1>I love being a comic.</v>

831
00:22:18.071 --> 00:22:18.904
<v Speaker 1>It's I,</v>

832
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.810
<v Speaker 1>no matter,</v>

833
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:20.643
<v Speaker 1>no matter what,</v>

834
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I always have that if,</v>

835
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:22.780
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:23.021
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

837
00:22:23.021 --> 00:22:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I've had,</v>

838
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.590
<v Speaker 1>I've had a ton of auditions for TV shows that I haven't gotten.</v>

839
00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:27.431
<v Speaker 1>Thanks Peter.</v>

00:22:32.721 --> 00:22:33.760
<v Speaker 1>He's changed the game.</v>

844
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.410
<v Speaker 1>He's so fucking good.</v>

845
00:22:35.411 --> 00:22:35.920
<v Speaker 1>He's the,</v>

846
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:40.920
<v Speaker 1>he's the main guy and I'd show he's the dude and it's the biggest movie ever,</v>

847
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.790
<v Speaker 1>the biggest show rather ever.</v>

848
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:46.600
<v Speaker 1>And that show is one of the most impactful shows ever.</v>

849
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.030
<v Speaker 1>And a dwarf is really the big guy.</v>

850
00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.470
<v Speaker 1>And I love that.</v>

851
00:22:50.471 --> 00:22:51.940
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that,</v>

852
00:22:51.941 --> 00:22:52.331
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

853
00:22:52.331 --> 00:22:55.000
<v Speaker 1>they talk about like can being a dwarf in the show,</v>

854
00:22:55.001 --> 00:22:56.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the focus.</v>

855
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>

856
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.150
<v Speaker 1>It's just like the,</v>

857
00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.770
<v Speaker 1>he talked about now off man,</v>

858
00:22:59.771 --> 00:23:04.771
<v Speaker 1>it was what's beautiful about what he does in his character and that show is he</v>

859
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:07.820
<v Speaker 1>utilizes it to his advantage and he,</v>

860
00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.520
<v Speaker 1>he lets people underestimate him because ultimately,</v>

861
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:11.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

862
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:12.310
<v Speaker 1>And a Lord,</v>

863
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Lord knows that's,</v>

864
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:14.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

865
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:16.180
<v Speaker 1>that's true for anyone that has to work with them.</v>

866
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:16.421
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

867
00:23:16.421 --> 00:23:17.254
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

868
00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:18.160
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

869
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.350
<v Speaker 1>no one thinks that we can do certain things or,</v>

870
00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:21.670
<v Speaker 1>or they're just not sure.</v>

871
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.230
<v Speaker 1>Like hell.</v>

872
00:23:23.231 --> 00:23:25.170
<v Speaker 1>When I played hockey when I was a kid,</v>

873
00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:29.380
<v Speaker 1>like the coaches on the other team would tell their players,</v>

874
00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:29.650

<v Speaker 1>I was going to USC,</v>

1023
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.030
<v Speaker 1>I had a year to go to graduate and uh,</v>

1024
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:37.870
<v Speaker 1>I dropped out,</v>

1025
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:38.210

1027
00:26:41.431 --> 00:26:42.440
<v Speaker 1>for four years.</v>

1028
00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:44.940
<v Speaker 1>That's first of all way better job security.</v>

1029
00:26:44.941 --> 00:26:46.350
<v Speaker 1>If you're funny than ever,</v>

1030
00:26:46.351 --> 00:26:48.870
<v Speaker 1>whatever fucking career you're going to put together.</v>

1031
00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:51.990
<v Speaker 1>And people tell me,</v>

1032
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:52.561
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1033
00:26:52.561 --> 00:26:52.711
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1034
00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:54.000

<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

1038
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.750
<v Speaker 1>I was a communications major,</v>

1039
00:26:57.751 --> 00:26:58.650
<v Speaker 1>so calm down.</v>

1040
00:26:58.651 --> 00:26:59.790
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't curing cancer.</v>

1041
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Even if you were a doctor,</v>

1042
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1043
00:27:01.681 --> 00:27:04.830
<v Speaker 1>hard doctors have to work unless you were like obsessed with being a</v>

1044
00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:06.900
<v Speaker 1>neurosurgeon or something crazy like that.</v>

1045
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that job.</v>

1046
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:08.781

<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1049
00:27:09.301 --> 00:27:12.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm so glad that other people do it because it was so,</v>

1050
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:13.380
<v Speaker 1>so dumb.</v>

1051
00:27:13.381 --> 00:27:13.951
<v Speaker 1>Ass is like me.</v>

1052
00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Don't have to,</v>

1053
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.720
<v Speaker 1>well you know a guy like Carlos,</v>

1054
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.760
<v Speaker 1>even people that do bad things,</v>

1055
00:27:17.761 --> 00:27:19.920
<v Speaker 1>like people that have bad ethics,</v>

1056
00:27:19.921 --> 00:27:21.630
<v Speaker 1>they're not always bad.</v>

1057
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:22.950
<v Speaker 1>No know there's,</v>

1058
00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of gray in this world and that's,</v>

1059
00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:26.580
<v Speaker 1>that's the reality of life.</v>

1060
00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.740
<v Speaker 1>And he took me on the road and when we,</v>

1061
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.670
<v Speaker 1>and we were on the road,</v>

1062
00:27:29.671 --> 00:27:31.380
<v Speaker 1>he would pay for all my travel.</v>

1063
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.540
<v Speaker 1>He would pay for all my meals.</v>

1064
00:27:33.541 --> 00:27:33.870
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

1065
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:35.280
<v Speaker 1>if we were ever going shopping,</v>

1066
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:35.731
<v Speaker 1>he'd say,</v>

1067
00:27:35.731 --> 00:27:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1068
00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:36.721

1071
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Like he took great care of me.</v>

1072
00:27:40.201 --> 00:27:44.550
<v Speaker 1>And it's funny cause I mean like I still consider him a damn good friend.</v>

1073
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1074

1078
00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.713
<v Speaker 1>Brad Williams.</v>

1079
00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:57.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't pick a side.</v>

1080
00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

1081

<v Speaker 1>That's good man.</v>

1082
00:27:58.501 --> 00:27:59.910
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do to,</v>

1083
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I have friends that hate other friends.</v>

1084
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.393
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1085
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.570
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of acquaintances like that and,</v>

1086
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:05.921
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1087
00:28:05.921 --> 00:28:07.530
<v Speaker 1>and if you're the can't deal with that,</v>

1088
00:28:07.531 --> 00:28:08.320
<v Speaker 1>their babies,</v>

1089
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:08.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1090
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.250
<v Speaker 1>if you really need all your friends to be on your team like Nah Bro,</v>

1091
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.113
<v Speaker 1>the fuck off.</v>

1092
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Some people aren't going to like each other.</v>

1093
00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:14.980
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

1094
00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.530
<v Speaker 1>And if you have fans,</v>

1095
00:28:16.531 --> 00:28:20.820
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure you have fans that will never liked me because of my association.</v>

1096
00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:21.480
<v Speaker 1>Not True.</v>

1097
00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean those,</v>

1098
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.370
<v Speaker 1>those guys aren't really fans.</v>

1099
00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:24.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1100
00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean punks</v>

1101
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.650
<v Speaker 1>and I mean that's fine.</v>

1102
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:29.803
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

1103
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.361
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

1104
00:28:30.361 --> 00:28:32.550
<v Speaker 1>If you think that that term fan is weird anyway.</v>

1105
00:28:32.551 --> 00:28:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1106
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:33.773
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1107
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.690
<v Speaker 1>I hate it.</v>

1108
00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:35.640
<v Speaker 1>I hardly ever use it.</v>

1109
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:36.630
<v Speaker 1>It just seems odd.</v>

1110
00:28:36.631 --> 00:28:38.340
<v Speaker 1>It seems like you're diminishing a person.</v>

1111
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.840
<v Speaker 1>It's like people that like you,</v>

1112
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.733
<v Speaker 1>that's what they are.</v>

1113
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.150
<v Speaker 1>When you call someone a fan,</v>

1114
00:28:42.151 --> 00:28:43.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like all of a sudden like there's a,</v>

1115
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.020
<v Speaker 1>there's like a different tier does you?</v>

1116
00:28:46.021 --> 00:28:46.740
<v Speaker 1>And then there's them,</v>

1117
00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.180
<v Speaker 1>there's you and then there's the fans.</v>

1118
00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.360
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1119
00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.193
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

1120
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:51.283
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

1121
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:53.520
<v Speaker 1>whenever you label things like that,</v>

1122
00:28:53.521 --> 00:28:54.570
<v Speaker 1>like there's just people,</v>

1123
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:55.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1124
00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:55.560
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1125
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.000
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of bands that I like.</v>

1126
00:28:57.001 --> 00:28:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm a fan of a lot of musicians and now I'm friends with them and it's</v>

1127
00:28:59.881 --> 00:29:00.610
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

1128
00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:01.443
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1129

1131
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:05.760
<v Speaker 1>that started happening a lot.</v>

1132
00:29:05.761 --> 00:29:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Like I was a fan of people and then you know like once you get past a certain</v>

1133
00:29:10.051 --> 00:29:14.550
<v Speaker 1>level and that level is pretty much just open miker once you get past that level</v>

1134
00:29:14.551 --> 00:29:17.820
<v Speaker 1>you meet like every one is like if you're in New York or la,</v>

1135
00:29:17.821 --> 00:29:19.410
<v Speaker 1>you run into everybody.</v>

1136
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.240
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm like,</v>

1138

1139
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:32.160
<v Speaker 1>And then I started talking to him and now like I get an email from them every</v>

<v Speaker 1>No one is this being of all power that's hot.</v>

1165
00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Higher levels.</v>

1166
00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Like they're all people.</v>

1167
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is a person and the most brilliant people on Earth are just people.</v>

1168
00:30:17.891 --> 00:30:20.260
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I've found is the most successful people,</v>

1169
00:30:20.261 --> 00:30:21.520
<v Speaker 1>the most interesting people,</v>

1170
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.540
<v Speaker 1>people that I truly enjoy talking to their,</v>

1171
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:26.830
<v Speaker 1>they don't expect anything different.</v>

1172
00:30:26.831 --> 00:30:29.050
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as someone does expect something different,</v>

1173
00:30:29.051 --> 00:30:30.370
<v Speaker 1>then they stopped being cool.</v>

1174
00:30:30.371 --> 00:30:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Then I like them anymore.</v>

1175
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:32.170
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

1176
00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.250
<v Speaker 1>I can't just talk to you.</v>

1177
00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:33.491
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1178
00:30:33.491 --> 00:30:33.881
<v Speaker 1>you're now,</v>

1179
00:30:33.881 --> 00:30:34.631
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking weird.</v>

1180
00:30:34.631 --> 00:30:34.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1181
00:30:34.841 --> 00:30:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1182
00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:36.280
<v Speaker 1>now I have to make an appointment.</v>

1183
00:30:36.281 --> 00:30:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1184
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:37.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1185
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:37.571
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1186
00:30:37.571 --> 00:30:41.200
<v Speaker 1>I was at the Hollywood Improv and a Paul Mccartney was there.</v>

1187
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:41.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1188
00:30:41.651 --> 00:30:42.484
<v Speaker 1>I was there.</v>

1189
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:43.323
<v Speaker 1>I was there that night.</v>

1190
00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:45.260
<v Speaker 1>He was there two different times.</v>

1191
00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1192
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1193
00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:46.550
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1194
00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:47.170
<v Speaker 1>he'd loved,</v>

1195
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:51.340
<v Speaker 1>I guess for a while he just loved coming to see comedy and I got to talk to him</v>

1196
00:30:51.341 --> 00:30:52.240
<v Speaker 1>very briefly,</v>

1197
00:30:52.241 --> 00:30:53.200
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

1198
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.520
<v Speaker 1>but he had it like a guy that kept trying to drag him away and he kept looking</v>

1199
00:30:57.521 --> 00:30:57.821
<v Speaker 1>at like,</v>

1200
00:30:57.821 --> 00:30:58.061
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1201
00:30:58.061 --> 00:30:58.181
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1202
00:30:58.181 --> 00:30:58.480
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1203
00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

1204
00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.390

1205
00:30:59.390 --> 00:30:59.801
<v Speaker 1>let me talk.</v>

1206
00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell him.</v>

1207
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:00.730
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

1208
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:01.690
<v Speaker 1>he was the guy,</v>

1209
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.650
<v Speaker 1>whoever is fucking handler,</v>

1210
00:31:03.651 --> 00:31:04.540
<v Speaker 1>like handler,</v>

1211
00:31:04.541 --> 00:31:06.040
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fudge maggot.</v>

1212
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:06.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:31:06.521 --> 00:31:07.061
<v Speaker 1>It's just like Paul,</v>

1214
00:31:07.061 --> 00:31:07.421
<v Speaker 1>we gotta go,</v>

1215
00:31:07.421 --> 00:31:08.020
<v Speaker 1>we gotta go.</v>

1216
00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.580
<v Speaker 1>And Paul told him no,</v>

1217
00:31:09.581 --> 00:31:10.600
<v Speaker 1>and like took the time.</v>

1218
00:31:10.601 --> 00:31:13.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's literally the most famous person on the planet.</v>

1219
00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.080
<v Speaker 1>He's right up there.</v>

1220
00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:18.340
<v Speaker 1>He's got to be top five and he's taking time to be like,</v>

1221
00:31:18.341 --> 00:31:18.581
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1222
00:31:18.581 --> 00:31:21.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give this guy his moment.</v>

1223
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.010
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if it's just because he's a great dude.</v>

1224
00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:27.850
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he understands that I'm Paul Mccartney and if I talked to a guy,</v>

1225
00:31:27.851 --> 00:31:29.080
<v Speaker 1>it's going to make his life.</v>

1226
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1227
00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.450
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just a normal dude.</v>

1228
00:31:31.451 --> 00:31:32.920
<v Speaker 1>When I watched him talking to people,</v>

1229
00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:36.430
<v Speaker 1>he just seems like a guy who is a great artist,</v>

1230
00:31:36.431 --> 00:31:37.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's just a human being.</v>

1231
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:38.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1232
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.570
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what he seems like just a human being,</v>

1233
00:31:40.571 --> 00:31:40.900
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1234
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:41.860
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1235
00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:42.640
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

1236
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.850
<v Speaker 1>it's cool when you realize that and it's cool when you realize,</v>

1237
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.091
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

1238
00:31:46.091 --> 00:31:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I can just talk to whoever.</v>

1239
00:31:47.531 --> 00:31:48.110
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1240
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:53.110
<v Speaker 1>and when people in show business or whatever athletes that you look up to,</v>

1241
00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:00.240
<v Speaker 1>like I have fans that are musicians that I like and you know,</v>

1242
00:32:00.851 --> 00:32:01.780
<v Speaker 1>like now it's like wait,</v>

1243
00:32:01.781 --> 00:32:03.130
<v Speaker 1>they watch that they watch.</v>

1244
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:03.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1245
00:32:03.611 --> 00:32:05.200
<v Speaker 1>of course they watched that TV show,</v>

1246
00:32:05.201 --> 00:32:06.820
<v Speaker 1>they listened to that podcast.</v>

1247
00:32:06.821 --> 00:32:09.700
<v Speaker 1>They consume entertainment just because they're a human being.</v>

1248
00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Well that's also the cool thing about podcasts is that podcasts,</v>

1249
00:32:12.671 --> 00:32:17.380
<v Speaker 1>these long form long form conversations with no interruptions,</v>

1250
00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:17.620
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1251
00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.640
<v Speaker 1>they give you insight to a person that you,</v>

1252
00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.030
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1253
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:25.240
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of people listening to this right now feel like they're</v>

1254
00:32:25.241 --> 00:32:27.490
<v Speaker 1>sitting in here talking to us just hanging out.</v>

1255
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.391
<v Speaker 1>Cause that's what we're doing.</v>

1256
00:32:28.391 --> 00:32:28.840
<v Speaker 1>We're just,</v>

1257
00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:29.740
<v Speaker 1>we're just hanging out.</v>

1258
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1259
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:30.731
<v Speaker 1>It's not that.</v>

1260
00:32:30.731 --> 00:32:32.770
<v Speaker 1>It's not that radio thing where it's like,</v>

1261
00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:33.071
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1262
00:32:33.071 --> 00:32:33.700
<v Speaker 1>you have a fault,</v>

1263
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:34.960
<v Speaker 1>you have a four minute break,</v>

1264
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:37.260
<v Speaker 1>and so you got to essentially you're,</v>

1265
00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.740
<v Speaker 1>you're like pepper and you're pretty much doing your act because you're just</v>

1266
00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:40.070
<v Speaker 1>trying to get</v>

1267
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:41.240
<v Speaker 5>as many jokes in as possible.</v>

1268
00:32:41.241 --> 00:32:44.930
<v Speaker 5>So people come see you and wherever a common club you're playing,</v>

1269
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:45.291
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1270
00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:45.471
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1271
00:32:45.471 --> 00:32:50.471
<v Speaker 5>this is an actual conversation where you actually can dive into how people tick</v>

1272
00:32:50.721 --> 00:32:52.910
<v Speaker 5>and what people's thoughts are in the same sentence.</v>

1273
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:53.870
<v Speaker 5>Four minute breaks,</v>

1274
00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:55.280
<v Speaker 5>they fuck with the flow.</v>

1275
00:32:55.430 --> 00:33:00.020
<v Speaker 5>That's why I don't break up right money ever with come with commercials.</v>

1276
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.490
<v Speaker 5>I just do them in the beginning of the end.</v>

1277
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.690
<v Speaker 5>I don't buy and I get all of these like really juicy offers to doom in the</v>

1278
00:33:05.691 --> 00:33:06.390
<v Speaker 5>middle and I'm like,</v>

1279
00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:08.000
<v Speaker 5>it just fucks with the flow,</v>

1280
00:33:08.001 --> 00:33:08.431
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1281
00:33:08.431 --> 00:33:11.870
<v Speaker 5>You can't just stop a conversation like I'll do Adam Carolla's podcast.</v>

1282
00:33:11.871 --> 00:33:12.680
<v Speaker 5>I love the dude.</v>

1283
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.513
<v Speaker 5>But he'll be like,</v>

1284
00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:14.471
<v Speaker 5>well that's funny Shane,</v>

1285
00:33:14.471 --> 00:33:18.140
<v Speaker 5>that brand because a real great man.</v>

1286
00:33:18.141 --> 00:33:19.250
<v Speaker 5>Great man.</v>

1287
00:33:19.251 --> 00:33:20.084
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>

1288
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.470
<v Speaker 5>He'll just start talking and you're like,</v>

1289
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:21.690
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1290
00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:22.520
<v Speaker 5>you doing an ad?</v>

1291
00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:22.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1292
00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.750
<v Speaker 5>he's reading now.</v>

1293
00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:24.650
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1294
00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:25.483
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

1295
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.880
<v Speaker 5>And then you sort of build up this conversation.</v>

1296
00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:30.070
<v Speaker 5>I think go back into it also,</v>

1297
00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:34.220
<v Speaker 5>one of the reasons why I like doing these really long form conversations cause I</v>

1298
00:33:34.221 --> 00:33:35.540
<v Speaker 5>always found when I'm talking to people,</v>

1299
00:33:35.541 --> 00:33:36.374
<v Speaker 5>when we're alone,</v>

1300
00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:36.770
<v Speaker 5>we have a,</v>

1301
00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:38.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm having a really cool conversation with someone.</v>

1302
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:42.280
<v Speaker 5>It takes a while to sort of get cooking and then when it gets cookin everybody's</v>

1303
00:33:42.281 --> 00:33:43.820
<v Speaker 5>sort of relaxes and settles in,</v>

1304
00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:46.040
<v Speaker 5>then you really kind of understand who that person is,</v>

1305
00:33:46.041 --> 00:33:46.540
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1306
00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:46.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1307
00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.633
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1308
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:51.350
<v Speaker 5>Now a red band told me something when he was on the podcast,</v>

1309
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1314
00:33:55.761 --> 00:33:59.390
<v Speaker 5>that I wanted to ask you about because he said there was like a meeting at some</v>

1315
00:33:59.391 --> 00:33:59.661
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>

1316
00:33:59.661 --> 00:34:00.680
<v Speaker 5>Are you brought something up?</v>

1317
00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:01.730
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1323
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:12.860
<v Speaker 5>he's so retarded.</v>

1324
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.870
<v Speaker 5>That's so not true.</v>

1325
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.470
<v Speaker 5>And that was a,</v>

1326
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 5>that was a fucking sketch from the man show.</v>

1327
00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:19.520
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

1328
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.061
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1329
00:34:20.061 --> 00:34:20.660
<v Speaker 5>It was a ski.</v>

1330
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:21.740
<v Speaker 5>He's so confused.</v>

1331
00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.480
<v Speaker 5>Memory sucks so bad.</v>

1332
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:26.270
<v Speaker 5>I was hoping there was a meeting was it was,</v>

1333
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.370
<v Speaker 5>we definitely didn't have it.</v>

1334
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:32.480
<v Speaker 5>We might have joked around about it because it was during the same sort of time</v>

1335
00:34:32.481 --> 00:34:32.871
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>

1336
00:34:32.871 --> 00:34:33.850
<v Speaker 5>But we did a,</v>

1337
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.320
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

00:34:34.911 --> 00:34:37.340
<v Speaker 5>Stan hope did on the man show.</v>

1340
00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:38.300
<v Speaker 5>He went out,</v>

1341
00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:38.481
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>We just dissecting one of your bullshit stories.</v>

1344
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:50.410
<v Speaker 5>There was a sketch for the man show where Doug Stan hope was trying to steal the</v>

1345
00:34:51.201 --> 00:34:52.810
<v Speaker 5>man show midget.</v>

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:01.820
<v Speaker 5>he was a brilliant,</v>

1356
00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:03.680
<v Speaker 5>brilliant fucking bit.</v>

1357
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.981
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1358
00:35:03.981 --> 00:35:04.814
<v Speaker 5>it was,</v>

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:05.340
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1360
00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:05.670
<v Speaker 5>Done.</v>

1361
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.503
<v Speaker 5>Did something to him.</v>

1362
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.300
<v Speaker 5>Great Shit on that.</v>

1363
00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:09.320
<v Speaker 5>And that was one of them.</v>

1364
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:09.920
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1365
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.110
<v Speaker 5>And so mean maybe we said,</v>

1366
00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:12.560
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1367
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.960
<v Speaker 5>we should do that to him and see his buddy Brad,</v>

1368
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:18.140
<v Speaker 5>but we definitely didn't have a fucking meeting plan out,</v>

1369
00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:18.974
<v Speaker 5>stealing,</v>

1370
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.960
<v Speaker 5>haven't meeting is a meeting.</v>

1371
00:35:20.961 --> 00:35:21.621
<v Speaker 5>I just said it was,</v>

1372
00:35:21.621 --> 00:35:22.070
<v Speaker 5>you said,</v>

1373
00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:24.050
<v Speaker 5>you said there was a conversation where you're like,</v>

1374
00:35:24.051 --> 00:35:24.620
<v Speaker 5>let's do it live.</v>

1375
00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.453
<v Speaker 5>A steel mill.</v>

1376
00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.601
<v Speaker 5>We talk about,</v>

1377
00:35:26.601 --> 00:35:29.390
<v Speaker 5>would you blow a Unicorn if you knew you could live forever?</v>

1378
00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:33.500
<v Speaker 5>We've had some pretty ridiculous conversations about the answer's yes,</v>

1379
00:35:33.501 --> 00:35:34.311
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

1380
00:35:34.311 --> 00:35:35.150
<v Speaker 5>if you could live forever,</v>

1381
00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:35.781
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know,</v>

1382
00:35:35.781 --> 00:35:35.991
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1383
00:35:35.991 --> 00:35:37.620
<v Speaker 5>you might not want to live forever</v>

1384
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.551
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

1385
00:35:38.551 --> 00:35:39.720
<v Speaker 2>I as I get older,</v>

1386
00:35:39.721 --> 00:35:40.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1387
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:40.680
<v Speaker 2>who?</v>

1388
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:40.981
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1389
00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:42.030
<v Speaker 2>if you weren't alive,</v>

1390
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:43.530
<v Speaker 2>you would never expect life,</v>

1391
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1392
00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Because you wouldn't have any expectations.</v>

1393
00:35:45.721 --> 00:35:46.554
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't be alive.</v>

1394
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.800
<v Speaker 2>Now that you are alive where you wouldn't expect what happens after life,</v>

1395
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.420
<v Speaker 2>we're just guessing that it's nothing.</v>

1396
00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:51.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1397
00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:52.171
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1398
00:35:52.171 --> 00:35:56.120
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying that it's a bunch of dudes in the clouds with a harp shirts.</v>

1399
00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:01.160
<v Speaker 2>Very possible that whatever the fuck consciousness is is not native only to this</v>

1400
00:36:01.831 --> 00:36:02.640
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

1401
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

1402
00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.700
<v Speaker 2>It's not restricted only to this existence.</v>

1403
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:08.460
<v Speaker 2>It's very possible that whatever you have,</v>

1404
00:36:08.461 --> 00:36:10.140
<v Speaker 2>whatever's going on when you dream,</v>

1405
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:11.041
<v Speaker 2>whatever's going on,</v>

1406
00:36:11.041 --> 00:36:13.170
<v Speaker 2>when you take mushrooms with whatever's going on,</v>

1407
00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:14.004
<v Speaker 2>when you die,</v>

1408
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.650
<v Speaker 2>they might be very similar things.</v>

1409
00:36:15.651 --> 00:36:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>

1410
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:16.021
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1411
00:36:16.021 --> 00:36:20.580
<v Speaker 2>your consciousness might be some sort of energy that moves on to some new plane</v>

1412
00:36:20.581 --> 00:36:24.240
<v Speaker 2>of existence that might be way cooler than this healthy body that we're all</v>

1413
00:36:24.241 --> 00:36:26.040
<v Speaker 2>trapped as if the,</v>

1414
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.360
<v Speaker 2>if the theory holds true,</v>

1415
00:36:27.361 --> 00:36:29.910
<v Speaker 2>that there's an infinite number of universes.</v>

1416
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:32.430
<v Speaker 2>Who knows that you just don't hop to another universe and say,</v>

1417
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:33.120
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1418
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:34.020
<v Speaker 2>there's your shot again.</v>

1419
00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:34.883
<v Speaker 2>Go again.</v>

1420
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:35.671
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

1421
00:36:35.671 --> 00:36:37.920
<v Speaker 2>That's not what happens every time you wake up.</v>

1422
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:41.100
<v Speaker 2>It's very possible that every time you wake up you were in a different</v>

1423
00:36:41.101 --> 00:36:41.934
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>

1424
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Blow my mind already.</v>

1425
00:36:42.951 --> 00:36:43.650
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan,</v>

1426
00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I had a crazy dream about that last night.</v>

1427
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.670
<v Speaker 2>I had a crazy dream last night.</v>

1428
00:36:47.671 --> 00:36:48.600
<v Speaker 2>That was a,</v>

1429
00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:51.030
<v Speaker 2>I had DMT trip in my dream,</v>

1430
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:52.170
<v Speaker 2>which I've never had before.</v>

1431
00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Now I've had DMT,</v>

1432
00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:55.980
<v Speaker 2>DMT.</v>

1433
00:36:55.981 --> 00:36:56.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm new to all of this,</v>

1434
00:36:56.881 --> 00:36:58.770
<v Speaker 2>but DMT trip during your dream,</v>

1435
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:59.731
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of Meta,</v>

1436
00:36:59.731 --> 00:37:00.091
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1437
00:37:00.091 --> 00:37:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Cause isn't DMT kind of what makes you train supposedly that's a lot.</v>

1438
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.133
<v Speaker 2>All theory,</v>

1439
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:04.921
<v Speaker 2>but it's not what,</v>

1440
00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:06.870
<v Speaker 2>you'd never dream a DMT trip.</v>

1441
00:37:06.871 --> 00:37:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Like DMT trips are way more intense than a dream because you're getting,</v>

1442
00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:14.010
<v Speaker 2>you're flooding your brain with this chemical that's native to your brain.</v>

1443
00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:16.560
<v Speaker 2>But the idea being that when you're sleeping,</v>

1444
00:37:16.561 --> 00:37:19.800
<v Speaker 2>there's times when you're in heavy rem sleep or you're not conscious when you do</v>

1445
00:37:19.801 --> 00:37:21.090
<v Speaker 2>visit the same realms.</v>

1446
00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:22.860
<v Speaker 2>But I've never remembered it before.</v>

1447
00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:23.690
<v Speaker 2>Not like,</v>

1448
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:24.660
<v Speaker 2>like last night,</v>

1449
00:37:24.661 --> 00:37:26.400
<v Speaker 2>like last night I was in there,</v>

1450
00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:26.731
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1451
00:37:26.731 --> 00:37:27.541
<v Speaker 2>It was really,</v>

1452
00:37:27.541 --> 00:37:27.991
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1453
00:37:27.991 --> 00:37:30.120
<v Speaker 2>really intense and very strange.</v>

1454
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:32.850
<v Speaker 2>But it was essentially,</v>

1455
00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:38.180
<v Speaker 2>it was this dream was in some way telling me that this state that,</v>

1456
00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:44.520
<v Speaker 2>that what we're doing here right now that don't get all crazy about this,</v>

1457
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.380
<v Speaker 2>don't get crazy about this life,</v>

1458
00:37:46.381 --> 00:37:51.381
<v Speaker 2>don't get too fixated on it because it's really just one piece of some sort of</v>

1459
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:55.030
<v Speaker 2>infinite mandola of existence and just they're like,</v>

1460
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:55.611
<v Speaker 2>that was the,</v>

1461
00:37:55.611 --> 00:37:58.500
<v Speaker 2>the entire DMT trip and my dream was,</v>

1462
00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.270
<v Speaker 2>was relax,</v>

1463
00:38:00.271 --> 00:38:00.840
<v Speaker 2>relax.</v>

1464
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.380
<v Speaker 2>It was like somehow another coaxing or coaching rather me to,</v>

1465
00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:07.020
<v Speaker 2>to relax and to,</v>

1466
00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:12.070
<v Speaker 2>to understand that like all the stress and all the weird shit that people have</v>

1467
00:38:12.211 --> 00:38:12.811
<v Speaker 2>in their brain.</v>

1468
00:38:12.811 --> 00:38:16.330
<v Speaker 2>Like the more you can like settle that in the mall,</v>

1469
00:38:16.331 --> 00:38:16.860
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

1470
00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:17.790
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1471
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:22.820
<v Speaker 2>the more you can exist in like a real peaceful state where,</v>

1472
00:38:23.691 --> 00:38:28.350
<v Speaker 2>where this is like your real self [inaudible] you're just constantly being</v>

1473
00:38:28.351 --> 00:38:32.400
<v Speaker 2>inundated with all these different ideas and stresses and different things that</v>

1474
00:38:32.401 --> 00:38:35.250
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to accomplish in different things that you're concentrating on,</v>

1475
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:36.221
<v Speaker 2>worrying about,</v>

1476
00:38:36.221 --> 00:38:37.540
<v Speaker 2>concerned about the,</v>

1477
00:38:37.541 --> 00:38:37.841
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1478
00:38:37.841 --> 00:38:39.490
<v Speaker 2>that you anticipate in the future.</v>

1479
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:41.920
<v Speaker 2>But I thought all these things are bullshit and that was,</v>

1480
00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:42.830
<v Speaker 2>that was the dream last night.</v>

1481
00:38:42.831 --> 00:38:43.331
<v Speaker 2>It was very,</v>

1482
00:38:43.331 --> 00:38:44.110
<v Speaker 2>very strange.</v>

1483
00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:44.870
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>

1484
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1485
00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Did you,</v>

1486
00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.450
<v Speaker 1>were you on the new mood?</v>

1487
00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Was it at the five HTP and no,</v>

1488
00:38:49.671 --> 00:38:50.630
<v Speaker 1>no I didn't take anything.</v>

1489
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:51.341
<v Speaker 2>Just went to sleep.</v>

1490
00:38:51.341 --> 00:38:53.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean I took some Alpha brain during the day.</v>

1491
00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1492
00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:56.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that had anything to do with it.</v>

1493
00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.480
<v Speaker 1>I've been taking that Zma again,</v>

1494
00:38:58.481 --> 00:39:00.270
<v Speaker 1>I just got a new bottle of it and that,</v>

1495
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:02.680
<v Speaker 1>that shit really does fuck with your dreams alive.</v>

1496
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Cause ever since I got that bottle every night,</v>

1497
00:39:04.511 --> 00:39:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had dreams until I got that</v>

1498
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:09.650
<v Speaker 2>zinc ups or testosterone.</v>

1499
00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.771
<v Speaker 2>It a ups,</v>

1500
00:39:10.771 --> 00:39:13.740
<v Speaker 2>your sperm production probably has a lot to do with the,</v>

1501
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.800
<v Speaker 2>and then it probably helps you sleep too.</v>

1502
00:39:15.801 --> 00:39:16.730
<v Speaker 2>I think it relaxes you.</v>

1503
00:39:16.731 --> 00:39:17.564
<v Speaker 2>It helps you sleep</v>

1504
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:19.300
<v Speaker 1>stuff I know nothing about.</v>

1505
00:39:19.301 --> 00:39:24.301
<v Speaker 1>So I'm fascinated by all by all this stuff like just in your,</v>

1506
00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.930
<v Speaker 1>cause you've done so many things in terms of other levels of consciousness and</v>

1507
00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:30.041
<v Speaker 1>things of that nature.</v>

1508
00:39:30.041 --> 00:39:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I've never even done mushrooms,</v>

1509
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:32.380
<v Speaker 1>so I'm like,</v>

1510
00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:33.790
<v Speaker 1>I should go to shrimp fest.</v>

1511
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.080
<v Speaker 1>You should do shrimp festival.</v>

1512
00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Ari Shaffir in the desert.</v>

1513
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.940
<v Speaker 1>He'd do it every year.</v>

1514
00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.650
<v Speaker 1>He's been trying to get me to go.</v>

1515
00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.190
<v Speaker 1>I would love,</v>

1516
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:40.560
<v Speaker 1>I would love to go like I've had.</v>

1517
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:41.381
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't you go?</v>

1518
00:39:41.381 --> 00:39:42.430
<v Speaker 1>How come you haven't done so far?</v>

1519
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.530
<v Speaker 1>It's such bad experiences on drugs,</v>

1520
00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:45.730
<v Speaker 1>but drugs just,</v>

1521
00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.080
<v Speaker 1>we'd just,</v>

1522
00:39:47.081 --> 00:39:47.321
<v Speaker 1>we'd,</v>

1523
00:39:47.321 --> 00:39:51.460
<v Speaker 1>I've had that experiences like panic attacks and anxiety attacks.</v>

1524
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:52.721
<v Speaker 1>It's the good stuff.</v>

1525
00:39:52.721 --> 00:39:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Then you're getting good shit.</v>

1526
00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:54.603
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1527
00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:56.920
<v Speaker 1>that's this podcast.</v>

1528
00:39:56.921 --> 00:39:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much every couple of weeks all of us go into a panic attack.</v>

1529
00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:00.953
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic.</v>

1530
00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:01.853
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1531
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.160
<v Speaker 1>there was one time,</v>

1532
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.520
<v Speaker 1>it was my birthday in Vegas and uh,</v>

1533
00:40:06.521 --> 00:40:07.180
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

1534
00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:10.270
<v Speaker 1>I was severely dehydrated and on top of that I took away too much of a pot</v>

1535
00:40:10.271 --> 00:40:15.271
<v Speaker 1>cookie and a passed out at the Rio like next to like next to a slot machine,</v>

1536
00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.020
<v Speaker 1>like just collapsed.</v>

1537
00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Like it was like a,</v>

1538
00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.950
<v Speaker 1>like a Marion editor just drop the puppet strings.</v>

1539
00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:21.910
<v Speaker 1>It was sounds awesome.</v>

1540
00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.140
<v Speaker 1>The weirdest thing is that like,</v>

1541
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:26.590
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

1542
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:27.401
<v Speaker 1>like first of all,</v>

1543
00:40:27.401 --> 00:40:28.450
<v Speaker 1>it's Vegas.</v>

1544
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:29.770
<v Speaker 1>So people walk by,</v>

1545
00:40:29.771 --> 00:40:31.390
<v Speaker 1>they see a midget passed out in the real,</v>

1546
00:40:31.391 --> 00:40:31.661
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

1547
00:40:31.661 --> 00:40:31.751
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1548
00:40:31.751 --> 00:40:32.680
<v Speaker 1>that's a new exhibit.</v>

1549
00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:32.951
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1550
00:40:32.951 --> 00:40:33.784
<v Speaker 1>that's funny.</v>

1551
00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:36.150
<v Speaker 2>Getting anything out of it.</v>

1552
00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:36.481
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1553
00:40:36.481 --> 00:40:39.340
<v Speaker 2>did you like when you had that experience and you,</v>

1554
00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:39.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1555
00:40:39.621 --> 00:40:41.970
<v Speaker 2>you have this panic attack after it's over.</v>

1556
00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:44.040
<v Speaker 2>Do you experience any,</v>

1557
00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.030
<v Speaker 2>anything positive?</v>

1558
00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:46.373
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1559
00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.580
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I like,</v>

1560
00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:51.540
<v Speaker 1>the only positivity I had was because I went to the hospital and they pumped me</v>

1561
00:40:51.541 --> 00:40:54.630
<v Speaker 1>soul full of fluids that I felt so good afterward.</v>

1562
00:40:54.631 --> 00:40:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I was so hydrated that that felt amazing.</v>

1563
00:40:57.541 --> 00:41:00.090
<v Speaker 1>So they gave you an ivy and the hospital gave me an ivy,</v>

1564
00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:01.560
<v Speaker 1>but you'll be so dehydrated.</v>

1565
00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I gotten a massage or early in the day and I didn't like take and it was like</v>

1566
00:41:06.151 --> 00:41:06.781
<v Speaker 1>the deep tissue,</v>

1567
00:41:06.781 --> 00:41:08.310
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that,</v>

1568
00:41:08.311 --> 00:41:10.680
<v Speaker 1>like really sort of like you need to drink water after that.</v>

1569
00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.200
<v Speaker 1>You need to wait a minute.</v>

1570
00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:17.400
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not going to get you that the somebody rubbing on your skin,</v>

1571
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.040
<v Speaker 1>they do into ringing you out like a dish cloth.</v>

1572
00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:20.913
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1573
00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:21.541
<v Speaker 1>Hey Joe,</v>

1574
00:41:21.541 --> 00:41:22.374
<v Speaker 1>I'm very tiny.</v>

1575
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Holds a bottle of water.</v>

1576
00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:27.010
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>

1577
00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:28.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1578
00:41:28.291 --> 00:41:28.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1579
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:29.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean to be honest with you,</v>

1580
00:41:29.731 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when they tell you after a massage drink bottled water.</v>

1581
00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Most of that's bullshit.</v>

1582
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1583
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:36.771
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1584
00:41:36.771 --> 00:41:39.740
<v Speaker 2>What they're trying to tell you is the get your toxins,</v>

1585
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:41.150
<v Speaker 2>toxins out of your system.</v>

1586
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.350
<v Speaker 2>I drink the water.</v>

1587
00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:43.550
<v Speaker 2>I know that the whole toxins,</v>

1588
00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.560
<v Speaker 2>toxic muscles are releasing toxins.</v>

1589
00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Your body is fucking processing toxins with your liver.</v>

1590
00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:49.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1591
00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.710
<v Speaker 2>You know what happens when you get your,</v>

1592
00:41:50.711 --> 00:41:51.710
<v Speaker 2>your muscles rubbed.</v>

1593
00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:53.420
<v Speaker 2>It breaks up your tissue a little bit.</v>

1594
00:41:53.421 --> 00:41:53.750
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1595
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:58.220
<v Speaker 2>it's massaging soft tissue and loosens things up and it makes you feel better.</v>

1596
00:41:58.370 --> 00:41:59.630
<v Speaker 2>You should drink water anyway.</v>

1597
00:41:59.720 --> 00:41:59.931
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1598
00:41:59.931 --> 00:42:01.070
<v Speaker 2>No water is good for you.</v>

1599
00:42:01.071 --> 00:42:03.500
<v Speaker 2>But I really don't believe that,</v>

1600
00:42:03.501 --> 00:42:03.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1601
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:05.180
<v Speaker 2>when you get a massage,</v>

1602
00:42:05.181 --> 00:42:06.620
<v Speaker 2>it's releasing toxins.</v>

1603
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.041
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1604
00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:08.210
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm wrong,</v>

1605
00:42:08.211 --> 00:42:08.561
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1606
00:42:08.561 --> 00:42:10.640
<v Speaker 2>I just don't see how it could have.</v>

1607
00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Some are rubbing your body can never heard a doctor say that these toxins that</v>

1608
00:42:15.231 --> 00:42:18.140
<v Speaker 2>are released when you have a very strenuous exercise,</v>

1609
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.810
<v Speaker 2>like that's why those crossfit or people,</v>

1610
00:42:20.811 --> 00:42:25.310
<v Speaker 2>they get that rob Doe Mile Osis I think that's how you say it Rhabdo is,</v>

1611
00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:25.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1612
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.630
<v Speaker 2>it's when your,</v>

1613
00:42:26.631 --> 00:42:30.410
<v Speaker 2>your kidneys start failing because your kidneys can't process.</v>

1614
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:30.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1615
00:42:30.831 --> 00:42:31.041
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>

1616
00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:33.350
<v Speaker 2>your muscles are breaking down and the,</v>

1617
00:42:33.351 --> 00:42:35.780
<v Speaker 2>and your kidneys can't process all the,</v>

1618
00:42:35.781 --> 00:42:35.961
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1619
00:42:35.961 --> 00:42:37.910
<v Speaker 2>the toxins and all the fluid.</v>

1620
00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:38.151
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1621
00:42:38.151 --> 00:42:38.421
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1622
00:42:38.421 --> 00:42:39.500
<v Speaker 2>it's very dangerous.</v>

1623
00:42:39.501 --> 00:42:40.040
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

1624
00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.920
<v Speaker 2>it was really rare up until this crossfit,</v>

1625
00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:44.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1626
00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:45.123
<v Speaker 2>sorta craze.</v>

1627
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.200
<v Speaker 2>But now when people go to the hospital and they,</v>

1628
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:51.590
<v Speaker 2>they find that they're having kidney failure and then they have this rob doe</v>

1629
00:42:51.591 --> 00:42:53.600
<v Speaker 2>meiosis or however the fuck you say it.</v>

1630
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:55.060
<v Speaker 2>And they always ask him,</v>

1631
00:42:55.061 --> 00:42:56.030
<v Speaker 2>why are you doing crossfit?</v>

1632
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Because crossfit,</v>

1633
00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.970
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to get people to do like,</v>

1634
00:42:58.971 --> 00:42:59.241
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1635
00:42:59.241 --> 00:43:02.290
<v Speaker 2>50 fucking clean and presses in a row and it,</v>

1636
00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1637
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.310
<v Speaker 2>and they'll have competitions with each other.</v>

1638
00:43:04.311 --> 00:43:04.510
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1639
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:07.040
<v Speaker 2>you're pushing your body way past,</v>

1640
00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:08.630
<v Speaker 2>like a workout limit.</v>

1641
00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.930
<v Speaker 2>You're pushing your pot to the point of like real failure.</v>

1642
00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1643
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.690
<v Speaker 2>You talked to a guy who's done crossfit for 10 years.</v>

1644
00:43:14.691 --> 00:43:18.680
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have like some significant fucking injuries like significant back</v>

1645
00:43:18.681 --> 00:43:19.130
<v Speaker 2>injury,</v>

1646
00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:22.430
<v Speaker 2>significant muscle tears or something along those lines.</v>

1647
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:23.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm really glad you're saying this Joe,</v>

1648
00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:27.440
<v Speaker 2>because now I could have a legitimate reason to not do crossfit.</v>

1649
00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Had not just that I'm a lazy fuck.</v>

1650
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Well my good friend is Steve Maxwell,</v>

1651
00:43:32.871 --> 00:43:34.700
<v Speaker 2>who's is really world renowned,</v>

1652
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:35.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1653
00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:38.420
<v Speaker 2>strength and conditioning coach and he's worked with a lot of high level MMA</v>

1654
00:43:38.421 --> 00:43:38.841
<v Speaker 2>fighters.</v>

1655
00:43:38.841 --> 00:43:42.530
<v Speaker 2>He was one of the first Americans to get his black belt in Jujitsu and he's just</v>

1656
00:43:42.531 --> 00:43:47.531
<v Speaker 2>this great guy and know so much about martial arts and know so much about</v>

1657
00:43:48.771 --> 00:43:51.890
<v Speaker 2>strength and conditioning and health and he fucking hates it.</v>

1658
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.780
<v Speaker 2>He thinks that what crossfit is,</v>

1659
00:43:53.781 --> 00:43:57.470
<v Speaker 2>he says you're doing a competition to lift weights.</v>

1660
00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:58.520
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1661
00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.470
<v Speaker 2>unless you're doing like a power,</v>

1662
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:01.910
<v Speaker 2>like when you watch power lifting,</v>

1663
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:03.560
<v Speaker 2>they did do that once.</v>

1664
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.240
<v Speaker 2>It's like a one lift thing.</v>

1665
00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.430
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're doing a bunch of them in a row,</v>

1666
00:44:07.431 --> 00:44:12.431
<v Speaker 2>like what his take on it is that weightlifting should be to strengthen your body</v>

1667
00:44:14.601 --> 00:44:15.470
<v Speaker 2>for sports,</v>

1668
00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:20.110
<v Speaker 2>strengthen your body for competition and when you do a competition of weight,</v>

1669
00:44:20.111 --> 00:44:20.950
<v Speaker 2>weight lifting,</v>

1670
00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:21.531
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1671
00:44:21.531 --> 00:44:22.790
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of ridiculous.</v>

1672
00:44:22.791 --> 00:44:25.970
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda defeats the purpose of strength and conditioning in the first place.</v>

1673
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.270
<v Speaker 2>Like doing strength and conditioning as a sport.</v>

1674
00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:29.991
<v Speaker 2>He sees,</v>

1675
00:44:29.991 --> 00:44:30.561
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1676
00:44:30.561 --> 00:44:31.381
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of silly.</v>

1677
00:44:31.381 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's supposed</v>

1678
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:33.450
<v Speaker 5>to help sports.</v>

1679
00:44:33.451 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 5>It's not supposed to be the sport.</v>

1680
00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:35.880
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1681
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:36.450
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1682
00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:36.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1683
00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:37.411
<v Speaker 5>that makes sense.</v>

1684
00:44:37.411 --> 00:44:41.250
<v Speaker 5>The peony and there's other people that have a similar criticism and their take</v>

1685
00:44:41.251 --> 00:44:44.880
<v Speaker 5>on it is that when you see these big compound movements,</v>

1686
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:45.750
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1687
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:47.850
<v Speaker 5>like Olympic cleans and presses,</v>

1688
00:44:47.851 --> 00:44:50.010
<v Speaker 5>like these are full body movements.</v>

1689
00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:54.600
<v Speaker 5>Those are supposed to be done with low repetition because yeah,</v>

1690
00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.280
<v Speaker 5>well a few times maybe,</v>

1691
00:44:56.281 --> 00:44:56.581
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1692
00:44:56.581 --> 00:44:57.540
<v Speaker 5>maybe a couple,</v>

1693
00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:01.620
<v Speaker 5>but you're not supposed to engage those muscles like that,</v>

1694
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:02.940
<v Speaker 5>like over and over and over again.</v>

1695
00:45:02.941 --> 00:45:06.360
<v Speaker 5>To the point of failure because you're taking some big fucking risks.</v>

1696
00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:09.030
<v Speaker 5>You're putting really heavy weight over your head.</v>

1697
00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:09.511
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

1698
00:45:09.511 --> 00:45:09.781
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1699
00:45:09.781 --> 00:45:12.950
<v Speaker 5>you're throwing your back into this it and well,</v>

1700
00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:13.260
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1701
00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.440
<v Speaker 5>you've seen all the youtube videos of people like dropping the weight on their</v>

1702
00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:17.274
<v Speaker 5>necks or like,</v>

1703
00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:20.940
<v Speaker 5>or like some people lose their bowels while they're doing the weightlifting and</v>

1704
00:45:20.941 --> 00:45:22.020
<v Speaker 5>can only be so lucky.</v>

1705
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:22.883
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1706
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:23.670
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

1707
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:24.060
<v Speaker 5>I've seen,</v>

1708
00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:25.170
<v Speaker 5>I've seen those videos,</v>

1709
00:45:25.171 --> 00:45:26.040
<v Speaker 5>so yeah,</v>

1710
00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:26.920
<v Speaker 5>like I,</v>

1711
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:29.490
<v Speaker 5>and Shocker,</v>

1712
00:45:29.491 --> 00:45:30.211
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a doctor,</v>

1713
00:45:30.211 --> 00:45:30.830
<v Speaker 5>but that,</v>

1714
00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.180
<v Speaker 5>that that just doesn't seem right,</v>

1715
00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.310
<v Speaker 5>that it doesn't seem like your body should be doing that.</v>

1716
00:45:35.311 --> 00:45:36.360
<v Speaker 5>And then the other side,</v>

1717
00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:39.120
<v Speaker 5>a side effect of crossfit is that,</v>

1718
00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:39.391
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1719
00:45:39.391 --> 00:45:40.380
<v Speaker 5>when you meet someone,</v>

1720
00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:42.000
<v Speaker 5>the first sentence out of your mouth is,</v>

1721
00:45:42.001 --> 00:45:42.870
<v Speaker 5>I do crossfit.</v>

1722
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:43.480
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1723
00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.180
<v Speaker 5>That's usually people just starting to do it,</v>

1724
00:45:45.181 --> 00:45:45.361
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1725
00:45:45.361 --> 00:45:46.230
<v Speaker 5>it's like anything else.</v>

1726
00:45:46.231 --> 00:45:49.260
<v Speaker 5>People will just start to do it to people just become a Vegan.</v>

1727
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:49.780
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1728
00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.360
<v Speaker 5>when people just got into yoga,</v>

1729
00:45:51.361 --> 00:45:54.210
<v Speaker 5>they all do the same shit and we all just went into something that can't shut</v>

1730
00:45:54.211 --> 00:45:54.991
<v Speaker 5>the fuck up about it.</v>

1731
00:45:54.991 --> 00:45:55.980
<v Speaker 5>I've been guilty of that too.</v>

1732
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:56.220

1769
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:48.750
<v Speaker 5>like jerking off.</v>

1770
00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.340
<v Speaker 5>Then you should work out of the day to day or do box jumps</v>

1771
00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.480
<v Speaker 5>and lifting up a trashcan with Kellen.</v>

1780
00:47:05.281 --> 00:47:09.480
<v Speaker 5>but you can only do them like once every few months if at all.</v>

1781
00:47:09.481 --> 00:47:11.130

<v Speaker 5>That was so bad.</v>

1786
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:20.610
<v Speaker 5>You could take your finger and push it into her arm and it would stay like the</v>

1787
00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:23.760
<v Speaker 5>dent would stay and then it will like slowly come back up.</v>

1788
00:47:23.761 --> 00:47:26.150
<v Speaker 5>Like she was made out of remember stretch Armstrong.</v>

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:26.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.330
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>

1791
00:47:27.330 --> 00:47:28.950
<v Speaker 5>like human memory foams,</v>

1792
00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:32.830
<v Speaker 5>dehydration right from your kidney inflammation prize.</v>

1793
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:37.150
<v Speaker 5>She's a damn good massage from her kidneys were failing so her body was swollen.</v>

1794
00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:39.520
<v Speaker 5>Like everything was all fucked up with fluids.</v>

1795
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.031
<v Speaker 5>It's just like,</v>

1796
00:47:40.031 --> 00:47:40.990
<v Speaker 5>it's not good.</v>

1797
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.510
<v Speaker 5>My friend is going through kidney failure right now.</v>

1798
00:47:43.511 --> 00:47:43.940
<v Speaker 5>She has,</v>

1799
00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:48.370
<v Speaker 5>she's just got lupus and she's getting all these infusions and stuff like that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1803
00:47:50.681 --> 00:47:52.710
<v Speaker 5>So you can get rid of blinding and limit.</v>

1804
00:47:52.711 --> 00:47:52.991
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That's all.</v>

1847
00:48:41.411 --> 00:48:42.550
<v Speaker 5>I don't love about Seattle.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I love the people.</v>

1850
00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.390
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a smart town.</v>

1851
00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:46.680
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

1852
00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.550
<v Speaker 5>it's less materialistic.</v>

1853
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:53.551
<v Speaker 5>It's less like focused on just plain looks and attention and all the bullshit</v>

1854
00:48:55.031 --> 00:48:56.470
<v Speaker 5>that comes with this town.</v>

1855
00:48:56.590 --> 00:48:56.971
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1856
00:48:56.971 --> 00:48:58.680
<v Speaker 5>That you characterize for Hollywood.</v>

1857
00:48:58.681 --> 00:49:01.450
<v Speaker 5>Meaning we're kind of out of that loop because we're comics and you know,</v>

1858
00:49:01.451 --> 00:49:05.080
<v Speaker 5>we hang around with the store and it's just like we're barely in that loop,</v>

1859
00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:05.381
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1860
00:49:05.381 --> 00:49:06.191
<v Speaker 5>But God damn,</v>

1861
00:49:06.191 --> 00:49:07.930
<v Speaker 5>every now and then I dip my toe into it.</v>

1862
00:49:07.931 --> 00:49:09.150
<v Speaker 5>Like I'll go to a restaurant,</v>

1863
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.360
<v Speaker 5>I'll see Paparazzi in front and people that are like just,</v>

1864
00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:13.720
<v Speaker 5>just all that horse shit.</v>

1865
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:15.160
<v Speaker 5>It's just so stupid.</v>

1866
00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:16.990
<v Speaker 5>The mind numbing.</v>

1867
00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:21.910
<v Speaker 5>The most annoying part about the whole la scene for me is talking to someone and</v>

1868
00:49:21.911 --> 00:49:23.830
<v Speaker 5>while I'm trying to make eye contact,</v>

1869
00:49:23.831 --> 00:49:26.500
<v Speaker 5>they are looking around for the next person to talk to.</v>

1870
00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:27.970
<v Speaker 5>Oh there's certain places,</v>

1871
00:49:27.971 --> 00:49:31.540
<v Speaker 5>if you go to certain places that's all anyone is doing is looking for famous</v>

1872
00:49:31.541 --> 00:49:34.240
<v Speaker 5>people to walk in and then they're going to go talk.</v>

1873
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.511
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1874
00:49:34.511 --> 00:49:34.751
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:35.160
<v Speaker 1>We live in an amazing time.</v>

2019
00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2020
00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:35.731
<v Speaker 1>but mate,</v>

2021
00:53:35.731 --> 00:53:37.380
<v Speaker 1>you can get video on your phone.</v>

2022
00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:38.050
<v Speaker 1>You go outside,</v>

2023
00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:39.040
<v Speaker 1>you hear birds Chirp,</v>

2024
00:53:39.041 --> 00:53:39.691
<v Speaker 1>you meet people,</v>

2025
00:53:39.691 --> 00:53:40.524
<v Speaker 1>you'll hug them.</v>

2026
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:45.630
<v Speaker 1>All you're doing is complaining about a fucking cartoon movie of cartoonish</v>

2027
00:53:46.111 --> 00:53:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Comic Book Movie as if somehow now this is the degradation of the moral fiber of</v>

2028
00:53:50.881 --> 00:53:54.030
<v Speaker 1>our culture and the degrading of women.</v>

2029
00:53:54.031 --> 00:53:58.860
<v Speaker 1>A dehumanizing is their message behind the hulk smashing a Mercedes.</v>

2030
00:53:58.861 --> 00:54:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Is that that we need to not buy foreign cars?</v>

2031
00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:01.621
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2032
00:54:01.621 --> 00:54:03.540
<v Speaker 1>it's cause it looked fucking cool comments.</v>

2033
00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.170
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2034
00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:05.010
<v Speaker 1>It's constant.</v>

2035
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:09.180
<v Speaker 1>The world's filled with comments someone gave me the best advice I ever got for</v>

2036
00:54:09.181 --> 00:54:11.160
<v Speaker 1>being in show business is Brad.</v>

2037
00:54:11.161 --> 00:54:11.994
<v Speaker 1>Just remember,</v>

2038
00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.980
<v Speaker 1>nobody cares about you.</v>

2039
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:15.120
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

2040
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.110
<v Speaker 1>That's advice sucks.</v>

2041
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I said that was by shitting on you.</v>

2042
00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I love that advice and not fucking with your parents tell you that every day of</v>

2043
00:54:21.781 --> 00:54:22.614
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

2044
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Like I love that advice.</v>

2045
00:54:24.901 --> 00:54:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Not for the fact that nobody cares in terms of,</v>

2046
00:54:27.001 --> 00:54:29.310
<v Speaker 1>no one loves you or anything like that.</v>

2047
00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:32.490
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of these people get in their own heads and it's very,</v>

2048
00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:35.130
<v Speaker 1>it's very narcissistic where it's like,</v>

2049
00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:38.820
<v Speaker 1>oh this person tweeted this so this offends me.</v>

2050
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Or how does this affect me?</v>

2051
00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Or this person didn't book me on this show.</v>

2052
00:54:42.631 --> 00:54:44.370
<v Speaker 1>So he is mad at me.</v>

2053
00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:45.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2054
00:54:45.030 --> 00:54:48.750
<v Speaker 1>or there's 22 million comics in La and he didn't put on the show that week.</v>

2055
00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:49.710
<v Speaker 1>Come down.</v>

2056
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:50.041
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2057
00:54:50.041 --> 00:54:51.300
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about totally different things.</v>

2058
00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2059
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:51.781
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2060
00:54:51.781 --> 00:54:52.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2061
00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:52.261
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2062
00:54:52.261 --> 00:54:55.380
<v Speaker 1>You're just talking about people who are just egomaniacs and completely obsessed</v>

2063
00:54:55.381 --> 00:54:56.011
<v Speaker 1>with themselves.</v>

2064
00:54:56.011 --> 00:54:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Don't be that Jamie,</v>

2065
00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:59.071
<v Speaker 1>can you make some team,</v>

2066
00:54:59.071 --> 00:54:59.311
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2067
00:54:59.311 --> 00:55:01.290
<v Speaker 1>I got some fucking crazy phlegm going on here.</v>

2068
00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:02.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2069
00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2070
00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:03.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2071
00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:06.150
<v Speaker 1>I've got a comic friend of mine and she told me,</v>

2072
00:55:06.151 --> 00:55:06.630
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

2073
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:07.321
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2074
00:55:07.321 --> 00:55:10.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm really stressing over the fact that some people said something about my</v>

2075
00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Twitter avatar picture and,</v>

2076
00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:14.700
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's holding you back in this business.</v>

2077
00:55:14.701 --> 00:55:17.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm like holding me back in the show business.</v>

2078
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:19.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2079
00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:20.190
<v Speaker 1>you're just talking to idiots.</v>

2080
00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:21.961
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

2081
00:55:21.961 --> 00:55:25.980
<v Speaker 1>no one's gonna hire you and then looks at your Twitter avatar photo and says,</v>

2082
00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:26.420
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2083
00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:27.270
<v Speaker 1>can't hire that person.</v>

2084
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:29.700
<v Speaker 1>There are people that do believe that those people that believe,</v>

2085
00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:29.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2086
00:55:29.911 --> 00:55:31.530
<v Speaker 1>you have to have the perfect headshot.</v>

2087
00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:32.600
<v Speaker 1>You have to have this and that.</v>

2088
00:55:32.670 --> 00:55:34.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't even have a fucking headshot.</v>

2089
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:34.913
<v Speaker 1>I need to get one.</v>

2090
00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:35.903
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get them together.</v>

2091
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.421
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2092
00:55:36.421 --> 00:55:36.661
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2093
00:55:36.661 --> 00:55:38.820
<v Speaker 1>I kind of have a photo that I use for Twitter.</v>

2094
00:55:38.821 --> 00:55:40.950
<v Speaker 1>That's my profile picture on Twitter.</v>

2095
00:55:40.951 --> 00:55:41.700
<v Speaker 1>That's probably it.</v>

2096
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Kind of a headshot.</v>

2097
00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:43.800
<v Speaker 1>But like when people say,</v>

2098
00:55:43.801 --> 00:55:44.041
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2116
00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:08.970
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2117
00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:12.680
<v Speaker 1>there's so many people out there that have ideas of like what you need to do as,</v>

2118
00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:14.400
<v Speaker 1>as a comic or an actor,</v>

2119
00:56:14.401 --> 00:56:15.234
<v Speaker 1>like what you need to do.</v>

2120
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.530
<v Speaker 1>And it's because they're trying to figure out themselves.</v>

2121
00:56:17.531 --> 00:56:21.310
<v Speaker 1>So part of it they're trying to like justify their own choices with you,</v>

2122
00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:22.130
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.980
<v Speaker 5>holding you back or I feel like this is holding me back and they're trying to</v>

2128
00:56:26.981 --> 00:56:27.814
<v Speaker 5>figure it out.</v>

2129
00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:28.773
<v Speaker 5>So they talking,</v>

2130

<v Speaker 5>they just mom died.</v>

2131
00:56:30.030 --> 00:56:32.710
<v Speaker 5>I just put it out there just so hopefully they come up with the answer.</v>

2132
00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:33.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2133
00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:35.110
<v Speaker 5>they're exercising their own anxiety,</v>

2134
00:56:35.111 --> 00:56:35.361
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2135
00:56:35.361 --> 00:56:36.940
<v Speaker 5>It's just fucking Dudee pitches.</v>

2136
00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:39.280
<v Speaker 5>The world's filled with nutty bitches,</v>

00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:40.600
<v Speaker 5>That's really what's going on.</v>

2139
00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:41.920
<v Speaker 5>I would wholeheartedly agree.</v>

2140
00:56:41.921 --> 00:56:42.550
<v Speaker 5>Joe Rogan,</v>

2141
00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:45.790
<v Speaker 5>this poor fucking Josh Weeden guy or Joss Whedon.</v>

2142
00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:46.903
<v Speaker 5>How'd he say we?</v>

2143
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:48.700
<v Speaker 5>W.</v>

2144
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:48.700
<v Speaker 5>H.</v>

2145
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:48.700
<v Speaker 5>E.</v>

2146
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:48.700
<v Speaker 5>D.</v>

2147
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:48.700
<v Speaker 5>O.</v>

2148
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:48.720
<v Speaker 5>N.</v>

2149
00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.553
<v Speaker 5>How do you say that?</v>

2150
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:50.261
<v Speaker 5>Who is this person?</v>

2151
00:56:50.261 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 5>This is the guy that directed the x man.</v>

2152
00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:56.200
<v Speaker 5>I read some of the tweets and holy fuck did they go after this guy?</v>

2153
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:59.140
<v Speaker 5>But if that happens to me all the time and you just block it,</v>

2154
00:56:59.141 --> 00:57:00.040
<v Speaker 5>you don't quit Twitter,</v>

2155
00:57:00.041 --> 00:57:01.030
<v Speaker 5>why would you quit Twitter?</v>

2156
00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:02.230
<v Speaker 5>Why wouldn't you just block that shit?</v>

2157
00:57:02.310 --> 00:57:03.460
<v Speaker 5>Cause he's tired of assholes.</v>

2158
00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:08.820
<v Speaker 5>I think when it becomes part of your day to go through your Twitter and like,</v>

2159
00:57:09.101 --> 00:57:09.491
<v Speaker 5>okay blah,</v>

2160
00:57:09.491 --> 00:57:09.901
<v Speaker 5>blah blah,</v>

2161
00:57:09.901 --> 00:57:10.121
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

2162
00:57:10.121 --> 00:57:10.540
<v Speaker 5>blah.</v>

2163
00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:11.770
<v Speaker 5>Like when that becomes,</v>

2164
00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:16.300
<v Speaker 5>when it's adding stress that you don't have to have and just doesn't need</v>

2165
00:57:16.301 --> 00:57:17.134
<v Speaker 5>Twitter,</v>

2166
00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:18.340
<v Speaker 5>he directs movies.</v>

2167
00:57:18.341 --> 00:57:19.510
<v Speaker 5>He makes a ton of money.</v>

2168
00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:20.673
<v Speaker 5>Good for you.</v>

2169
00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:23.320
<v Speaker 5>Well I think that some times it's great.</v>

2170
00:57:23.410 --> 00:57:24.370
<v Speaker 5>I love Twitter.</v>

2171
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.440
<v Speaker 5>I love communicating with people online.</v>

2172
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.741
<v Speaker 5>It just,</v>

2173
00:57:26.741 --> 00:57:28.650
<v Speaker 5>you take a risk that you're going to run into cunts.</v>

2174
00:57:28.940 --> 00:57:29.170
<v Speaker 5>Yep.</v>

2175
00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:31.150
<v Speaker 5>And if you only run into my,</v>

2176
00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:32.910
<v Speaker 5>my opinion on the,</v>

2177
00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.690
<v Speaker 5>the amount of people that suck is,</v>

2178
00:57:34.691 --> 00:57:35.950
<v Speaker 5>it's a very small amount,</v>

2179
00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:37.660
<v Speaker 5>but if there are vocally active,</v>

2180
00:57:37.661 --> 00:57:38.620
<v Speaker 5>very small amount,</v>

2181
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:39.970
<v Speaker 5>if you look at some of these people,</v>

2182
00:57:39.971 --> 00:57:42.340
<v Speaker 5>like we were talking about the social justice warrior guys,</v>

2183
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:47.670
<v Speaker 5>that guy had fucking 15 tweets about x men and I'm not bullshitting 15 tweets</v>

2184
00:57:49.151 --> 00:57:50.590
<v Speaker 5>about how horrible it was.</v>

2185
00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:55.660
<v Speaker 5>Sexist and ablest and all this different stupid fucking shit that if you are one</v>

2186
00:57:57.101 --> 00:57:59.910
<v Speaker 5>person and you have all these comments on the,</v>

2187
00:57:59.911 --> 00:58:02.710
<v Speaker 5>the horrible nature of this one particular thing,</v>

2188
00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:05.500
<v Speaker 5>it's like this guy runs into that and he's,</v>

2189
00:58:05.501 --> 00:58:05.891
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2190
00:58:05.891 --> 00:58:07.090
<v Speaker 5>he's fucking tired of,</v>

2191
00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:08.110
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't want to deal.</v>

2192
00:58:08.310 --> 00:58:09.143
<v Speaker 5>And there's a,</v>

2193
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:10.810
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

2194
00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:13.870
<v Speaker 5>it's strange because all these social media platforms,</v>

2195
00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:14.290
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2196
00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:14.680
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2197
00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.101
<v Speaker 5>like you say,</v>

2198
00:58:15.101 --> 00:58:18.610
<v Speaker 5>there are unbelievable in terms of the fact that you can communicate with anyone</v>

2199
00:58:18.910 --> 00:58:23.650
<v Speaker 5>you could get because before you didn't know how to get an access to someone</v>

2200
00:58:23.651 --> 00:58:26.170
<v Speaker 5>that you were a fan of or that you watched on TV,</v>

2201
00:58:26.171 --> 00:58:27.100
<v Speaker 5>you would know how to do it.</v>

2202
00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:28.690
<v Speaker 5>Like you got to go through a publicist,</v>

2203
00:58:28.691 --> 00:58:29.050
<v Speaker 5>you gotta write,</v>

2204
00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:30.190
<v Speaker 5>you gotta write a fan club,</v>

2205
00:58:30.191 --> 00:58:31.180
<v Speaker 5>and then you like,</v>

2206
00:58:31.181 --> 00:58:32.410
<v Speaker 5>you didn't know what to do.</v>

2207
00:58:32.411 --> 00:58:35.320
<v Speaker 5>Now you can instantly say something to anyone and it ended,</v>

2208
00:58:35.321 --> 00:58:37.750
<v Speaker 5>they had a good possibility of seeing it.</v>

2209
00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:40.000
<v Speaker 5>That part is unbelievable,</v>

2210
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:44.950
<v Speaker 5>but then you have so much else that comes with it where now because people have</v>

2211
00:58:44.951 --> 00:58:45.581
<v Speaker 5>that voice now,</v>

2212
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:49.900
<v Speaker 5>they feel like people need to hear their voice constantly in whatever topic that</v>

2213
00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:50.501
<v Speaker 5>might be,</v>

2214
00:58:50.501 --> 00:58:51.334
<v Speaker 5>whether it be,</v>

2215
00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:53.650
<v Speaker 5>I got offended at this personal thing.</v>

2216
00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:56.440
<v Speaker 5>Everyone needs to know I was offending like that.</v>

2217
00:58:56.520 --> 00:59:01.360
<v Speaker 5>And we acknowledge they're there trying to get social points so when they're</v>

2218
00:59:01.361 --> 00:59:04.840
<v Speaker 5>complaining about something or calling something sexist or calling something</v>

2219
00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:06.850
<v Speaker 5>homophobic or whatever they're doing.</v>

2220
00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:07.450
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

2221
00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:08.830
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes they're complaining,</v>

2222
00:59:08.831 --> 00:59:13.300
<v Speaker 5>but oftentimes what they're doing is they're trying to show you that they know</v>

2223
00:59:13.301 --> 00:59:14.350
<v Speaker 5>that something's bad,</v>

2224
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:16.930
<v Speaker 5>which makes them have a high moral fiber.</v>

2225
00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:20.980
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to show you that they're a very moral person with really strong,</v>

2226
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:25.760
<v Speaker 5>intelligent opinions and that these ass holes is it all the time and are talls</v>

2227
00:59:25.761 --> 00:59:27.230
<v Speaker 5>that are ruining the world.</v>

2228
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:28.760
<v Speaker 5>They're below that.</v>

2229
00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:33.850
<v Speaker 5>I get that because I say the word midget a lot and that is apparently a horrible</v>

2230
00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:34.581
<v Speaker 5>word dude.</v>

2231
00:59:34.581 --> 00:59:37.130
<v Speaker 5>You gotta fucking green light to say midget like I got a green light to say</v>

2232
00:59:37.131 --> 00:59:37.964
<v Speaker 5>Guinea</v>

2233
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:41.750
<v Speaker 5>and then when he gets mad at me for calling Italians guineas,</v>

2234
00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:42.140
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2235
00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:43.250
<v Speaker 5>my last name is Rogan.</v>

2236
00:59:43.251 --> 00:59:44.300
<v Speaker 5>I am mostly Italian.</v>

2237
00:59:44.301 --> 00:59:45.500
<v Speaker 5>So fuck you.</v>

2238
00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:46.940
<v Speaker 5>And if you don't think they're guineas,</v>

2239
00:59:46.941 --> 00:59:48.500
<v Speaker 5>you need to meet my fucking relatives.</v>

2240
00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.830
<v Speaker 5>I'll show you some pictures of some grown men with gold chains.</v>

2241
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:52.690
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2242
00:59:52.690 --> 00:59:53.150
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2243
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.471
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2244
00:59:53.471 --> 00:59:57.410
<v Speaker 5>but I get attacked all the time for say for saying the word midget in my act and</v>

2245
00:59:57.411 --> 00:59:58.244
<v Speaker 5>it's just like,</v>

2246
00:59:58.650 --> 00:59:59.260
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2247
00:59:59.260 --> 00:59:59.780
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2248
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:00.650
<v Speaker 5>and people say like,</v>

2249
01:00:00.651 --> 01:00:01.010
<v Speaker 5>don't,</v>

2250
01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:03.940
<v Speaker 5>aren't you concerned about the message that you're sending up?</v>

2251
01:00:03.941 --> 01:00:05.240
<v Speaker 5>This word is okay.</v>

2252
01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:05.931
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2253
01:00:05.931 --> 01:00:06.561
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2254
01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:07.610
<v Speaker 5>why is it bad?</v>

2255
01:00:07.611 --> 01:00:10.160
<v Speaker 5>I'm still trying to figure out why people don't like that word.</v>

2256
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:10.960
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2257
01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:11.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2258
01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:13.040
<v Speaker 5>I think it's a language police issue.</v>

2259
01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:14.870
<v Speaker 5>There's people that try to get rid of bossy.</v>

2260
01:00:14.871 --> 01:00:15.704
<v Speaker 5>Remember that?</v>

2261
01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:18.080
<v Speaker 5>Tried to get rid of Bossy a couple of years ago.</v>

2262
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:20.630
<v Speaker 5>It gave it a hard push to and everybody went,</v>

2263
01:00:20.631 --> 01:00:21.464
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

2264
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:22.343
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>

2265
01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:23.211
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2266
01:00:23.211 --> 01:00:24.044
<v Speaker 5>that's enough.</v>

2267
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:28.490
<v Speaker 5>I think we need to do that on a lot of people complaining about sir,</v>

2268
01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:31.400
<v Speaker 5>about certain words that we can't say that shows you like,</v>

2269
01:00:31.401 --> 01:00:33.240
<v Speaker 5>why would anybody want to get rid of bossy?</v>

2270
01:00:33.241 --> 01:00:34.940
<v Speaker 5>Is bossy really so strong.</v>

2271
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:35.570
<v Speaker 5>You know what,</v>

2272
01:00:35.570 --> 01:00:36.440
<v Speaker 5>and it was,</v>

2273
01:00:36.450 --> 01:00:37.970
<v Speaker 5>it was a sexist or something.</v>

2274
01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:41.450
<v Speaker 5>They were saying that they're used the word bossy to describe women,</v>

2275
01:00:41.451 --> 01:00:45.260
<v Speaker 5>the women that are powerful or women that are strong and in charge,</v>

2276
01:00:45.261 --> 01:00:49.880
<v Speaker 5>that they're bossy and that you're demeaning them and trying to marginalize them</v>

2277
01:00:49.881 --> 01:00:50.714
<v Speaker 5>and some sort of way.</v>

2278
01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:51.471
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2279
01:00:51.471 --> 01:00:52.110
<v Speaker 5>women were like,</v>

2280
01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:53.360
<v Speaker 5>get the fuck Outta here.</v>

2281
01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.090
<v Speaker 5>She's Ban Bossy with a little boy,</v>

2282
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:57.080
<v Speaker 5>asserts himself.</v>

2283
01:00:57.081 --> 01:00:58.100
<v Speaker 5>He's called a leader.</v>

2284
01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:58.491
<v Speaker 5>Yet.</v>

2285
01:00:58.491 --> 01:00:59.570
<v Speaker 5>When a girl does it,</v>

2286
01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:01.220
<v Speaker 5>she's risk being branded,</v>

2287
01:01:01.221 --> 01:01:02.054
<v Speaker 5>bossy,</v>

2288
01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:03.020
<v Speaker 5>where it's like Bossy,</v>

2289
01:01:03.021 --> 01:01:03.801
<v Speaker 5>send a message,</v>

2290
01:01:03.801 --> 01:01:06.680
<v Speaker 5>don't raise your hand or speak up by middle school.</v>

2291
01:01:06.681 --> 01:01:09.080
<v Speaker 5>Girls are less interested in leading than boys.</v>

2292
01:01:09.350 --> 01:01:10.100
<v Speaker 5>Listen man,</v>

2293
01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:10.580
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

2294
01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:14.480
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of that that's social and there's a lot of that that's learned</v>

2295
01:01:14.481 --> 01:01:18.350
<v Speaker 5>behavior and there's a lot of that that's biological and that's a fact and</v>

2296
01:01:18.351 --> 01:01:21.620
<v Speaker 5>that's why it's exists in almost every culture.</v>

2297
01:01:21.621 --> 01:01:23.660
<v Speaker 5>There's very few matriarchal cultures,</v>

2298
01:01:23.890 --> 01:01:27.680
<v Speaker 5>very few cultures that are run by women and that doesn't mean that women are</v>

2299
01:01:27.681 --> 01:01:28.470
<v Speaker 5>less than men.</v>

2300
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:33.200
<v Speaker 5>That just means that you got to stop trying to make everybody even because we're</v>

2301
01:01:33.201 --> 01:01:33.531
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

2302
01:01:33.531 --> 01:01:35.780
<v Speaker 5>even when it comes to child rearing,</v>

2303
01:01:35.781 --> 01:01:36.171
<v Speaker 5>we're not,</v>

2304
01:01:36.171 --> 01:01:37.790
<v Speaker 5>even when it comes to breastfeeding,</v>

2305
01:01:37.791 --> 01:01:40.310
<v Speaker 5>when not even when it comes to nurturing,</v>

2306
01:01:40.311 --> 01:01:40.671
<v Speaker 5>we're not,</v>

2307
01:01:40.671 --> 01:01:42.830
<v Speaker 5>even when it comes to emotional intelligence,</v>

2308
01:01:43.070 --> 01:01:47.180
<v Speaker 5>women are superior to men at a lot of ways in ended and you know,</v>

2309
01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:49.490
<v Speaker 5>if you try to make everybody the same,</v>

2310
01:01:49.491 --> 01:01:52.630
<v Speaker 5>you're going to have a fucking bullshit world that doesn't exist.</v>

2311
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.910
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2312
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:54.850
<v Speaker 5>If you say like,</v>

2313
01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:59.480
<v Speaker 5>I think there was a story recently about a woman firefighter that got hired just</v>

2314
01:01:59.481 --> 01:02:04.481
<v Speaker 5>because like they needed a woman firefighter and it's like that you're going</v>

2315
01:02:04.701 --> 01:02:07.520
<v Speaker 5>down a slope where it's like if I'm stuck in a burning building,</v>

2316
01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:08.570
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2317
01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:09.050
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2318
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:09.883
<v Speaker 5>if she can,</v>

2319
01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:11.030
<v Speaker 5>if she can run up there,</v>

2320
01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:11.990
<v Speaker 5>granted I don't weigh a lot,</v>

2321
01:02:11.991 --> 01:02:15.950
<v Speaker 5>but so if she can come up there and throw me over her shoulder and get me out of</v>

2322
01:02:15.951 --> 01:02:16.910
<v Speaker 5>there just as fast,</v>

2323
01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:18.110
<v Speaker 5>fantastic,</v>

01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.460
<v Speaker 5>I want her there.</v>

2326
01:02:20.461 --> 01:02:23.400
<v Speaker 5>Then if you're just trying to fill a quota,</v>

2327
01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:24.990
<v Speaker 5>if you're like,</v>

2328
01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:25.320
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2329
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:25.830

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:28.651
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>

2334
01:02:28.651 --> 01:02:29.760
<v Speaker 5>it's something where it was like,</v>

2335
01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:30.100
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2336
01:02:30.100 --> 01:02:30.630
<v Speaker 5>there's not,</v>

2337
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:32.370
<v Speaker 5>there's not enough blacks in baseball.</v>

2338
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:34.580
<v Speaker 5>Like there's not enough black people in baseball.</v>

2339
01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:36.930
<v Speaker 5>We need to get more black people in baseball.</v>

2340
01:02:36.931 --> 01:02:37.141
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2341
01:02:37.141 --> 01:02:37.501
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2342
01:02:37.501 --> 01:02:40.560
<v Speaker 5>if the Dominican's can throw faster and hit harder,</v>

2343
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.030
<v Speaker 5>that's who I want.</v>

2344
01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:42.863
<v Speaker 5>And baseball.</v>

2345
01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:43.501
<v Speaker 5>Fine.</v>

2346
01:02:43.501 --> 01:02:43.951
<v Speaker 5>You know what,</v>

2347
01:02:43.951 --> 01:02:44.310
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2348
01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:45.300
<v Speaker 5>why are you forcing it?</v>

2349
01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:45.930
<v Speaker 5>I don't think,</v>

2350
01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:48.180
<v Speaker 5>well I think there's certain issues with uh,</v>

2351
01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.320
<v Speaker 5>with sports where there is some sort of segregation or there is some sort of</v>

2352
01:02:52.530 --> 01:02:56.850
<v Speaker 5>discrimination and I don't know that that's one of them.</v>

2353
01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.300
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if they're trying to keep black people out of,</v>

2354
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:02.820
<v Speaker 5>I bet polo now how many fucking black people playing polo?</v>

2355
01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:04.140
<v Speaker 5>You might want to look in a polo.</v>

2356
01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:06.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2357
01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:07.310
<v Speaker 5>well cricket is a lot of,</v>

2358
01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:09.360
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people of color because a lot of Indians.</v>

2359
01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:09.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2360
01:03:09.810 --> 01:03:11.430
<v Speaker 5>People in India love cricket man.</v>

2361
01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:13.380
<v Speaker 5>They would like some of the best cricket players in the world.</v>

2362
01:03:13.381 --> 01:03:16.680
<v Speaker 5>That was that stupid movie where they recruited a cricket players to come over</v>

2363
01:03:16.681 --> 01:03:17.610
<v Speaker 5>to America to pitch.</v>

2364
01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.880
<v Speaker 5>Remember that stupid movie Jon Hamm?</v>

2365
01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:24.490
<v Speaker 5>It's like a love story because the name is a guy and a girl and like he loves,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>

2371
01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:33.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to start my own campaign.</v>

2372
01:03:33.211 --> 01:03:34.830
<v Speaker 5>There's not enough dwarves and baseball.</v>

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:42.660
<v Speaker 5>There's none in the NBA.</v>

2386
01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:43.650
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2387
01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:45.390
<v Speaker 5>w w w you know the fuck Joe.</v>

2388
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:47.030
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck indeed.</v>

2389
01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:48.170
<v Speaker 5>What the fucking deal,</v>

2390
01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.440
<v Speaker 5>what's wrong with my people?</v>

2391
01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:49.810
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2392
01:03:49.810 --> 01:03:53.280
<v Speaker 5>and then if you sit like when transgender people get into women's sports,</v>

2393
01:03:53.281 --> 01:03:54.240
<v Speaker 5>if you don't support that,</v>

2394
01:03:54.241 --> 01:03:55.170
<v Speaker 5>then you're a piece of shit.</v>

2395
01:03:55.171 --> 01:03:55.410
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2396
01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:55.980
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2397
01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:56.520
<v Speaker 5>you got,</v>

2398
01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:56.761
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2399
01:03:56.761 --> 01:03:57.720
<v Speaker 5>you got a lot of flack for that,</v>

2400
01:03:57.721 --> 01:03:58.020
<v Speaker 5>didn't you?</v>

2401
01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:58.853
<v Speaker 5>It was just,</v>

2402
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.300
<v Speaker 5>just a fighter thing.</v>

2403
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:01.590
<v Speaker 5>Just the one about the woman.</v>

2404
01:04:01.591 --> 01:04:01.651
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>

2405
01:04:01.651 --> 01:04:06.651
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty much cool with it and almost every other way we did talk about that</v>

2406
01:04:06.751 --> 01:04:08.400
<v Speaker 5>woman who used to be a man.</v>

2407
01:04:08.401 --> 01:04:11.730
<v Speaker 5>It was six foot six and 50 years old is playing college basketball,</v>

2408
01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.200
<v Speaker 5>which I think is ridiculous.</v>

2409
01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:13.831
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

2410
01:04:13.831 --> 01:04:14.580
<v Speaker 5>because she,</v>

2411
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:17.670
<v Speaker 5>she essentially has given a Redo for her whole life.</v>

2412
01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:19.560
<v Speaker 5>She already used up or college credits.</v>

2413
01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:19.981
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2414
01:04:19.981 --> 01:04:20.161
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2415
01:04:20.161 --> 01:04:21.990
<v Speaker 5>you can only play college sports for so long,</v>

2416
01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:23.123
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

2417
01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:25.350
<v Speaker 5>the dig is,</v>

2418
01:04:25.351 --> 01:04:29.400
<v Speaker 5>or the loophole is you can only play college sports as a man.</v>

2419
01:04:29.550 --> 01:04:31.800
<v Speaker 5>Now when you change your name and become a woman,</v>

2420
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:34.620
<v Speaker 5>now all of a sudden you get a whole new college sports career.</v>

2421
01:04:35.070 --> 01:04:35.550
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2422
01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:38.130
<v Speaker 5>So this man lived as a man,</v>

2423
01:04:38.131 --> 01:04:39.930
<v Speaker 5>played sports as a man,</v>

2424
01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:42.600
<v Speaker 5>live to be 50 got a sex change,</v>

2425
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:44.280
<v Speaker 5>which I'm fully in support of.</v>

2426
01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:47.130
<v Speaker 5>This is what I want to say is this is super important.</v>

2427
01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:50.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm not in any way saying that someone shouldn't be able to do that,</v>

2428
01:04:50.761 --> 01:04:53.730
<v Speaker 5>but what I am saying is when it comes to athletic competition,</v>

2429
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:57.720
<v Speaker 5>you've got a 50 year old man playing fucking college basketball.</v>

2430
01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.360
<v Speaker 5>Get an 18 year old girls if that's your daughter,</v>

2431
01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:00.871
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

2432
01:05:00.871 --> 01:05:01.650
<v Speaker 5>And your daughter,</v>

2433
01:05:01.650 --> 01:05:05.220
<v Speaker 5>she can't perform to the best of her abilities because it's unfair because you</v>

2434
01:05:05.221 --> 01:05:07.050
<v Speaker 5>have this giant fucking man,</v>

2435
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:12.470
<v Speaker 5>you know who's now a woman who's 50 who's been had full testosterone for 47</v>

2436
01:05:14.581 --> 01:05:18.310
<v Speaker 5>fucking years or whatever the hell it is before she became a man or it became a</v>

2437
01:05:18.311 --> 01:05:18.671
<v Speaker 5>woman.</v>

2438
01:05:18.671 --> 01:05:19.720
<v Speaker 5>Like that's crazy.</v>

2439
01:05:19.721 --> 01:05:19.881
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2440
01:05:19.881 --> 01:05:20.200
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2441
01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:20.440
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

2442
01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.320
<v Speaker 5>that's where sensitivity and progressiveness goes too far,</v>

2443
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.540
<v Speaker 5>but at least then no one's getting hurt.</v>

2444
01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:26.853
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2445
01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.180
<v Speaker 5>Where's the fight game?</v>

2446
01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:28.811
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2447
01:05:28.811 --> 01:05:29.231
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

2448
01:05:29.231 --> 01:05:32.800
<v Speaker 5>I had a huge fucking problem with and still do and most people do too.</v>

2449
01:05:32.801 --> 01:05:33.634
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

2450
01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:36.940
<v Speaker 5>a lot of fucking transgender people have an issue with that.</v>

2451
01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.000
<v Speaker 5>The people don't have an issue with that or,</v>

2452
01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:42.670
<v Speaker 5>or have an issue with me are the super progressive,</v>

2453
01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:47.110
<v Speaker 5>ultra liberal social justice warrior types who just don't have,</v>

2454
01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:48.610
<v Speaker 5>they don't have a dog in the fight.</v>

2455
01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.450
<v Speaker 5>They just not even that mad just saying they want the opportunity to call</v>

2456
01:05:52.451 --> 01:05:53.370
<v Speaker 5>someone a big,</v>

2457
01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:54.550
<v Speaker 5>they can't wait.</v>

2458
01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:56.260
<v Speaker 5>They just can't wait to get upset.</v>

2459
01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:59.230
<v Speaker 5>And just looking for the opportunity to call someone a piece of shit.</v>

2460
01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:00.520
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2461
01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:01.413
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

2462
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:06.370
<v Speaker 5>cause there's actually a surgery that you can have to lengthen your limbs.</v>

2463
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:07.650
<v Speaker 5>And I've seen that a,</v>

2464
01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:08.773
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2465
01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:09.731
<v Speaker 5>it's rough.</v>

2466
01:06:09.731 --> 01:06:10.121
<v Speaker 5>Fuck Dude.</v>

2467
01:06:10.121 --> 01:06:11.260
<v Speaker 5>It's freaky likes forever.</v>

2468
01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:11.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2469
01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:12.580
<v Speaker 5>it takes forever.</v>

2470
01:06:12.581 --> 01:06:13.520
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2471
01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:14.250
<v Speaker 5>and you're in pain.</v>

2472
01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:18.880
<v Speaker 5>It's literally they put braces on your arms and legs every day.</v>

2473
01:06:18.881 --> 01:06:23.881
<v Speaker 5>You turn a little crank and crank separates your bones by a mill of the,</v>

2474
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:25.390
<v Speaker 5>cut your bones,</v>

2475
01:06:25.391 --> 01:06:27.070
<v Speaker 5>first of all your bones.</v>

2476
01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:29.770
<v Speaker 5>And then they put this crazy brace with these screws on it.</v>

2477
01:06:29.771 --> 01:06:32.860
<v Speaker 5>They did this guy in China who couldn't get a girlfriend and you know,</v>

2478
01:06:32.970 --> 01:06:37.450
<v Speaker 5>he changed his height from like four foot 11 until like five,</v>

2479
01:06:37.451 --> 01:06:37.961
<v Speaker 5>three,</v>

2480
01:06:37.961 --> 01:06:39.580
<v Speaker 5>but it took years,</v>

2481
01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:41.230
<v Speaker 5>took years and I was in agony.</v>

2482
01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:46.290
<v Speaker 5>Every day you're breaking your arm and leg and the bone grows and regrows</v>

2483
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:48.000
<v Speaker 5>overnight.</v>

2484
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:48.833
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

2485
01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:51.680
<v Speaker 5>like we were talking about the bill burbot um,</v>

2486
01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:53.140
<v Speaker 5>earlier where it's like,</v>

2487
01:06:53.170 --> 01:06:53.470
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2488
01:06:53.470 --> 01:06:55.150
<v Speaker 5>just wait until they get good at it.</v>

2489
01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:58.480
<v Speaker 5>Fucking wait until they get good at the limb lengthening surgery guys.</v>

2490
01:06:58.660 --> 01:06:59.500
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

2491
01:06:59.501 --> 01:07:00.670
<v Speaker 5>Cause I've seen the people,</v>

2492
01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.060
<v Speaker 5>there's no other alternatives though.</v>

2493
01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:04.323
<v Speaker 5>I don't like that.</v>

2494
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:05.740
<v Speaker 5>I would never,</v>

2495
01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:06.670
<v Speaker 5>I would never get that.</v>

2496
01:07:06.671 --> 01:07:09.040
<v Speaker 5>I do not need to ride a roller coaster that bat.</v>

2497
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:09.903
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2498
01:07:10.450 --> 01:07:11.410
<v Speaker 5>But let me ask you this.</v>

2499
01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.550
<v Speaker 5>If they could do it,</v>

2500
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.220
<v Speaker 5>like say if they could do it and it was a onetime thing.</v>

2501
01:07:15.221 --> 01:07:15.761
<v Speaker 5>It took a year.</v>

2502
01:07:15.761 --> 01:07:19.750
<v Speaker 5>Like I had ACL reconstruction that took like six months and someone said,</v>

2503
01:07:19.751 --> 01:07:20.141
<v Speaker 5>Oh man,</v>

2504
01:07:20.141 --> 01:07:21.040
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't even get the surgery.</v>

2505
01:07:21.041 --> 01:07:21.311
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2506
01:07:21.311 --> 01:07:23.830
<v Speaker 5>but I go through the six months and then my knee works again.</v>

2507
01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:24.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2508
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:25.570
<v Speaker 5>Like if someone could do that,</v>

2509
01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:29.740
<v Speaker 5>if they could give you a surgery and you'd be in pain for like a year,</v>

2510
01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:32.200
<v Speaker 5>but after that year you would be,</v>

2511
01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:32.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2512
01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:33.101
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>

2513
01:07:33.101 --> 01:07:33.431
<v Speaker 5>six,</v>

2514
01:07:33.431 --> 01:07:33.960
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

2515
01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:34.793
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2516
01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:35.230
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

2517
01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:36.220
<v Speaker 5>that's a really interesting question.</v>

2518
01:07:36.221 --> 01:07:36.731
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

2519
01:07:36.731 --> 01:07:38.350
<v Speaker 5>I'd have to write a whole new act,</v>

2520
01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.353
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

2521
01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:40.571
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2522
01:07:40.571 --> 01:07:42.750
<v Speaker 5>I mean we'd write an act about how you used to be a dwarf.</v>

2523
01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:43.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2524
01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:43.751
<v Speaker 5>exactly right.</v>

2525
01:07:43.751 --> 01:07:44.620
<v Speaker 5>Crazy operation.</v>

2526
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:46.210
<v Speaker 5>And here's why.</v>

2527
01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:47.980
<v Speaker 5>Popping pain pills like tic tacs.</v>

2528
01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:52.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean if that surgery existed and it was,</v>

2529
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:57.870
<v Speaker 5>I could take the pill and or or whatever and then just be five foot six the next</v>

2530
01:07:58.450 --> 01:07:59.283
<v Speaker 5>day and not,</v>

2531
01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:01.150
<v Speaker 5>cause now the guys that have that limb lengthening surgery,</v>

2532
01:08:01.151 --> 01:08:05.440
<v Speaker 5>they look like you've had limb lengthening surgery where yeah,</v>

2533
01:08:05.441 --> 01:08:06.274
<v Speaker 5>you have like,</v>

2534
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:06.971
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2535
01:08:06.971 --> 01:08:08.710
<v Speaker 5>your mechanics are all wrong.</v>

2536
01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:08.981
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2537
01:08:08.981 --> 01:08:11.740
<v Speaker 5>Your shins are longer than your upper thigh.</v>

2538
01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:12.730
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2539
01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:12.941
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2540
01:08:12.941 --> 01:08:15.620
<v Speaker 5>so it just looks like you look at someone like that and you just like,</v>

2541
01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:16.483
<v Speaker 5>that's</v>

2542
01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:17.420
<v Speaker 1>he's off for,</v>

2543
01:08:17.421 --> 01:08:18.980
<v Speaker 1>she's off in some way.</v>

2544
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Natural look.</v>

2545
01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:23.260
<v Speaker 2>Sort of like when you look at a person's body,</v>

2546
01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:26.020
<v Speaker 2>there's a natural distance that most,</v>

2547
01:08:26.021 --> 01:08:28.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have people that have some extra long arms are extra wide,</v>

2548
01:08:28.901 --> 01:08:30.490
<v Speaker 2>shoulders are extra long legs.</v>

2549
01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:33.190
<v Speaker 2>But generally speaking it looks fairly normal.</v>

2550
01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:36.580
<v Speaker 2>But then some folks they get this surgery and you're,</v>

2551
01:08:36.610 --> 01:08:39.790
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing is they're taking your shin bone and they're stretching that</v>

2552
01:08:39.791 --> 01:08:40.624
<v Speaker 2>bitch out.</v>

2553
01:08:41.290 --> 01:08:42.550
<v Speaker 2>So your Shin is like,</v>

2554
01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:42.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2555
01:08:42.761 --> 01:08:44.200
<v Speaker 2>an extra couple inches longer.</v>

2556
01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2557
01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:45.941
<v Speaker 1>That's not fun.</v>

2558
01:08:45.941 --> 01:08:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>

2559
01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Do anything with time too.</v>

2560
01:08:47.441 --> 01:08:47.711
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2561
01:08:47.711 --> 01:08:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Did they do anything with like the snail Dick and the spikes and stuff like</v>

2562
01:08:50.531 --> 01:08:50.710
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

2563
01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:51.610
<v Speaker 1>You guys have to wait.</v>

2564
01:08:51.611 --> 01:08:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Snail Dick and spikes.</v>

2565
01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:53.950
<v Speaker 1>So what are you talking about?</v>

2566
01:08:53.951 --> 01:08:55.720
<v Speaker 1>What the Flash Oh,</v>

2567
01:08:55.721 --> 01:08:55.910
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2568
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just like a,</v>

2569
01:08:58.141 --> 01:09:01.390
<v Speaker 1>a stereotype about dwarves that that doesn't necessarily exist.</v>

2570
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2571
01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.130
<v Speaker 1>do you have any one side stick?</v>

2572
01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:10.250
<v Speaker 1>I was saying that I what the fuck in the old days with spikes spikes</v>

2573
01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.830
<v Speaker 1>my cock is like a medieval weapon.</v>

2574
01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Why would you say that?</v>

2575
01:09:16.481 --> 01:09:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Like it's normal.</v>

2576
01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:18.040
<v Speaker 1>And what does it,</v>

2577
01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.270
<v Speaker 1>does that make sense to you?</v>

2578
01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2579
01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Snail Dick would spikes.</v>

2580
01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.680
<v Speaker 1>You don't even qualify and it's so lazy</v>

2581
01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:26.040
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2582
01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:26.680
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>

2583
01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:27.190
<v Speaker 1>to add it,</v>

2584
01:09:27.190 --> 01:09:28.030
<v Speaker 1>to answer your question,</v>

2585
01:09:28.031 --> 01:09:28.331
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2586
01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:29.350
<v Speaker 1>I would probably do that.</v>

2587
01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:33.700
<v Speaker 1>I I'd probably cause there's health things that I'm going to go through that I'm</v>

2588
01:09:33.701 --> 01:09:37.150
<v Speaker 1>already going through that you're advertising people don't have to go through.</v>

2589
01:09:37.150 --> 01:09:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Like what kind of things you're going to?</v>

2590
01:09:38.830 --> 01:09:39.663
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2591
01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:44.410
<v Speaker 1>I've had a surgery on my legs because my legs were bowed and so I had to have</v>

2592
01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:48.370
<v Speaker 1>surgery on him to like straighten them up cause they were unhealthily boat.</v>

2593
01:09:48.371 --> 01:09:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Like I looked like I was a fucking croquet wicket and then,</v>

2594
01:09:51.731 --> 01:09:52.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2595
01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:53.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2596
01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:54.760
<v Speaker 1>I have back problems now.</v>

2597
01:09:54.761 --> 01:09:55.091
<v Speaker 1>Like right.</v>

2598
01:09:55.091 --> 01:09:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has back problems it seems like,</v>

2599
01:09:56.561 --> 01:09:58.150
<v Speaker 1>but I've like,</v>

2600
01:09:58.151 --> 01:09:58.961
<v Speaker 1>cause my spine,</v>

2601
01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I've got not scoliosis,</v>

2602
01:10:00.401 --> 01:10:01.810
<v Speaker 1>but what is it called?</v>

2603
01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Like a gnosis where it's curved on the very bottom.</v>

2604
01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2605
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:06.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2606
01:10:06.730 --> 01:10:07.870
<v Speaker 1>stenosis is a short,</v>

2607
01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.060
<v Speaker 1>like a shortening of the nerve canal.</v>

2608
01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:11.470
<v Speaker 1>It's probably something different.</v>

2609
01:10:11.770 --> 01:10:14.440
<v Speaker 1>I've got something where my spine curves at the bottom.</v>

2610
01:10:14.441 --> 01:10:16.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of little people that have breathing problems.</v>

2611
01:10:16.841 --> 01:10:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm thankfully not one of those.</v>

2612
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:19.241
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2613
01:10:19.241 --> 01:10:19.650
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2614
01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:19.860
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2615
01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:22.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of dwarfs that of have back surgeries like crazy,</v>

2616
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:27.610
<v Speaker 1>like neck surgeries cause and also these next are holding up these ginormous</v>

2617
01:10:27.611 --> 01:10:28.510
<v Speaker 1>heads that we have.</v>

2618
01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.420
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine there's a mechanical difference.</v>

2619
01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.780
<v Speaker 1>When you had the surgery for your legs,</v>

2620
01:10:34.781 --> 01:10:36.370
<v Speaker 1>like what do they do a,</v>

2621
01:10:36.371 --> 01:10:36.671
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2622
01:10:36.671 --> 01:10:37.391
<v Speaker 1>it's called,</v>

2623
01:10:37.391 --> 01:10:40.060
<v Speaker 1>I had what's called a dome osteotomy where they just,</v>

2624
01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:45.120
<v Speaker 1>they carve like a dome shape into my bone and then they just move the bone.</v>

2625
01:10:45.161 --> 01:10:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Like they just kind of,</v>

2626
01:10:46.690 --> 01:10:47.523
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2627
01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:48.910
<v Speaker 1>and they just straighten it up.</v>

2628
01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:51.130
<v Speaker 1>And I had to be in a wheelchair for about like eight months.</v>

2629
01:10:51.490 --> 01:10:52.323
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2630
01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.770
<v Speaker 1>when did you have that done?</v>

2631
01:10:53.800 --> 01:10:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Junior high.</v>

2632
01:10:54.761 --> 01:10:56.870
<v Speaker 1>So right when you're trying to get cool,</v>

2633
01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:58.720
<v Speaker 1>he's in a wheelchair.</v>

2634
01:10:59.000 --> 01:10:59.860
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

2635
01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:01.900
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy.</v>

2636
01:11:01.901 --> 01:11:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2637
01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:02.530
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2638
01:11:02.530 --> 01:11:03.860
<v Speaker 1>and I've been lucky like,</v>

2639
01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:07.900
<v Speaker 1>like the fact that I've only had essentially one major dwarf related surgery,</v>

2640
01:11:07.901 --> 01:11:10.660
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty rare for a 31 year old little person.</v>

2641
01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of us that have more surgeries that,</v>

2642
01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:14.580
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

2643
01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:15.570
<v Speaker 5>in that way,</v>

2644
01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:15.871
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2645
01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:18.240
<v Speaker 5>I would absolutely do the magical surgery that,</v>

2646
01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:18.960
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2647
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.950
<v Speaker 5>may doesn't exist,</v>

2648
01:11:20.670 --> 01:11:21.330
<v Speaker 5>doesn't exist.</v>

2649
01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:21.631
<v Speaker 5>Jimmy.</v>

2650
01:11:21.631 --> 01:11:22.560
<v Speaker 5>See if you can find that,</v>

2651
01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:25.880
<v Speaker 5>that piece that they did on people in China that,</v>

2652
01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:30.850
<v Speaker 5>that got that leg limb lengthening surgery cause it was really disturbing.</v>

2653
01:11:30.851 --> 01:11:31.381
<v Speaker 5>This poor guy,</v>

2654
01:11:31.381 --> 01:11:32.214
<v Speaker 5>they wanted to be,</v>

2655
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:33.630
<v Speaker 5>he wanted his face blurred out,</v>

2656
01:11:33.631 --> 01:11:36.450
<v Speaker 5>but he was just talking about how he's hoping that he could get a woman,</v>

2657
01:11:36.451 --> 01:11:36.661
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2658
01:11:36.661 --> 01:11:39.000
<v Speaker 5>that some day a woman would talk to them and dude,</v>

2659
01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:40.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm four foot four,</v>

2660
01:11:40.861 --> 01:11:41.520

2661
01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.353
<v Speaker 5>it's fine,</v>

2662
01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.710
<v Speaker 5>but you're a comic.</v>

2663
01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:44.880
<v Speaker 5>That's the difference,</v>

2664
01:11:44.881 --> 01:11:45.271
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:48.270
<v Speaker 5>It does help a lot,</v>

2667
01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:48.870
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

2668
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:51.660
<v Speaker 5>We've all seen some pretty ugly comics that have hot checks.</v>

2669
01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:52.411
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

2670
01:11:52.411 --> 01:11:53.820
<v Speaker 5>Like what the fuck is this?</v>

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.490
<v Speaker 5>You're just a slob.</v>

2675
01:11:58.330 --> 01:12:00.080
<v Speaker 5>That's the God's thank goddess.</v>

2676
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.943
<v Speaker 5>It.</v>

01:12:03.871 --> 01:12:04.171
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2682
01:12:04.441 --> 01:12:07.080
<v Speaker 5>This is the piece could crank this up from that Geo way.</v>

2683
01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.040
<v Speaker 5>It might get us.</v>

2684
01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:10.080
<v Speaker 5>Have you play it like the volume?</v>

2685
01:12:10.890 --> 01:12:11.101
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2686
01:12:11.101 --> 01:12:12.990
<v Speaker 5>just play the volume of it so we can listen to it.</v>

2687
01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:17.060
<v Speaker 6>Height has become a critical condition for success.</v>

2688
01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:17.953
<v Speaker 6>Oh Wow.</v>

2689
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:19.460
<v Speaker 6>Lack the proper tallness.</v>

2690
01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:20.820
<v Speaker 6>You may be denied jobs.</v>

2691

<v Speaker 6>Thomas is a word or even college admission.</v>

2692
01:12:24.650 --> 01:12:29.090
<v Speaker 6>Fucking sizes left out as a dating tallness isn't it?</v>

2693
01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.710
<v Speaker 6>Height one is to have their billing.</v>

2694
01:12:30.711 --> 01:12:31.910
<v Speaker 6>Scratch will be in Horn,</v>

2695
01:12:31.911 --> 01:12:33.050
<v Speaker 6>lengthy trial.</v>

2696
01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:35.330
<v Speaker 6>That can carry some serious risks.</v>

2697
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.660

01:12:37.410 --> 01:12:38.020
<v Speaker 6>Weekend.</v>

2701
01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.120
<v Speaker 6>We're in depth and they're not even towards</v>

2702
01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:44.210
<v Speaker 6>who Dan is given a local anesthetic,</v>

2703
01:12:44.690 --> 01:12:47.300
<v Speaker 6>which means he will be awake for the two hour long.</v>

2704
01:12:47.301 --> 01:12:47.870
<v Speaker 6>Perception.</v>

2705
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:48.703
<v Speaker 6>Fuck me.</v>

2706
01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.710
<v Speaker 6>No holes are drilled into.</v>

2707
01:12:51.310 --> 01:12:52.820
<v Speaker 6>That's a trail race.</v>

2708
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:54.050
<v Speaker 6>Is this food in place?</v>

2709
01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:58.640
<v Speaker 6>They look medievals but they are the key to stabilizing the leg.</v>

2710
01:12:58.670 --> 01:12:59.310
<v Speaker 6>No one.</v>

2711
01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:00.143
<v Speaker 6>Goodness.</v>

2712
01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:01.243
<v Speaker 6>Nope,</v>

2713
01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:03.653
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

2714
01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:06.890
<v Speaker 6>He's doing it with a wire saw.</v>

2715
01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.910
<v Speaker 6>Janet could be damage to the mirror.</v>

2716
01:13:11.780 --> 01:13:13.400
<v Speaker 6>Brian surrounded by this.</v>

2717
01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:14.840
<v Speaker 6>This is insane.</v>

2718
01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:16.820
<v Speaker 6>They're hammering into this guy shin.</v>

2719
01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:17.300
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2720
01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:19.700
<v Speaker 6>this guy's a week will grow into the gap.</v>

2721
01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:22.340
<v Speaker 6>Harnessing the healing power.</v>

2722
01:13:22.341 --> 01:13:24.200
<v Speaker 6>This is definitely something you're going to look back and go,</v>

2723
01:13:24.201 --> 01:13:26.870
<v Speaker 6>that's medieval 20 years from now,</v>

2724
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:29.900
<v Speaker 6>God and hear what he says here.</v>

2725
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.140
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's more gratifying for patients and doctors.</v>

2726
01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:35.000
<v Speaker 6>The the day the braces come off</v>

2727
01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:39.230
<v Speaker 6>after a process that has taken one long year,</v>

2728
01:13:39.530 --> 01:13:41.300
<v Speaker 6>that day has finally come.</v>

2729
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:42.183
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

2730
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:45.920
<v Speaker 6>Operation in reverse.</v>

2731
01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:50.590
<v Speaker 6>First the struts are removed out of their legs are here,</v>

2732
01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:52.720
<v Speaker 6>taking them face.</v>

2733
01:13:53.150 --> 01:13:55.750
<v Speaker 6>Now the patient can walk away by herself.</v>

2734
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:58.340
<v Speaker 6>Now I feel more natural,</v>

2735
01:13:58.470 --> 01:13:59.303
<v Speaker 6>more normal,</v>

2736
01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:01.070
<v Speaker 6>and I feel much happier.</v>

2737
01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:01.953
<v Speaker 6>Oh God,</v>

2738
01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:03.531
<v Speaker 6>I don't see that.</v>

2739
01:14:03.531 --> 01:14:05.840
<v Speaker 6>I see are in how many cars ranges later.</v>

2740
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:08.360
<v Speaker 6>Four inches to be joined society.</v>

2741
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.760
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2742
01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.490
<v Speaker 6>Color and more confident.</v>

2743
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.710
<v Speaker 6>First off,</v>

2744
01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:12.400
<v Speaker 6>the oranges</v>

2745
01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.590
<v Speaker 5>and your chin or your shade chooses,</v>

2746
01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:15.483
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

2747
01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:16.713
<v Speaker 5>Not a foot.</v>

2748
01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:17.913
<v Speaker 5>His homeboy.</v>

2749
01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:19.331
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2750
01:14:19.331 --> 01:14:19.810
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

2751
01:14:19.810 --> 01:14:21.490
<v Speaker 5>Now when they say four inches,</v>

2752
01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:23.890
<v Speaker 5>it's all four inches in your shins.</v>

2753
01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:26.740
<v Speaker 5>Like imagine if your Shin grew that much.</v>

2754
01:14:27.650 --> 01:14:28.120
<v Speaker 5>I can't.</v>

2755
01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:28.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2756
01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:32.830
<v Speaker 5>that can't be like your Shin can't maintain the same amount of strength and</v>

2757
01:14:32.831 --> 01:14:33.520
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2758
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:33.701
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2759
01:14:33.701 --> 01:14:34.534
<v Speaker 5>it definitely can.</v>

2760
01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:34.871
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2761
01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:35.820
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be exhausting.</v>

2762
01:14:35.850 --> 01:14:36.161
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2763
01:14:36.161 --> 01:14:37.060
<v Speaker 5>it's all bone.</v>

2764
01:14:37.300 --> 01:14:38.590
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's the issue.</v>

2765
01:14:38.591 --> 01:14:41.060
<v Speaker 5>I think the issue is like the mechanics of your body,</v>

2766
01:14:41.061 --> 01:14:41.920
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be different.</v>

2767
01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:44.560
<v Speaker 5>Especially if you do any kind of sport.</v>

2768
01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.960
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're standing on island stilts,</v>

2769
01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:48.060
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2770
01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:49.450
<v Speaker 5>just just a little extra there.</v>

2771
01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:49.631
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2772
01:14:49.631 --> 01:14:51.580
<v Speaker 5>Why don't you just get four inches put on your shoe?</v>

2773
01:14:51.710 --> 01:14:54.350
<v Speaker 5>You know that he wants to be naked and taller.</v>

2774
01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:54.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2775
01:14:54.650 --> 01:14:54.930
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2776
01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:55.763
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2777
01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.750
<v Speaker 5>But like that's the part that like that whole process,</v>

2778
01:14:58.751 --> 01:15:02.110
<v Speaker 5>we saw a two minute clip that's a year at least.</v>

2779
01:15:02.111 --> 01:15:07.060
<v Speaker 5>Or like between eight to 12 like eight to 14 months of doing that for four</v>

2780
01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.710
<v Speaker 5>freaking inches.</v>

2781
01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:11.740
<v Speaker 5>Well maybe she could do it or upper leg and get eight inches,</v>

2782
01:15:11.950 --> 01:15:16.950
<v Speaker 5>maybe a freaky ass legs and then do it on your back stretch or fuck him.</v>

2783
01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:20.320
<v Speaker 5>Imagine eating.</v>

2784
01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:22.570
<v Speaker 5>You don't see your friend for like a couple of years.</v>

2785
01:15:22.930 --> 01:15:25.180
<v Speaker 5>Then all sudden they're six to like two used to be five,</v>

2786
01:15:25.181 --> 01:15:25.541
<v Speaker 5>five.</v>

2787
01:15:25.541 --> 01:15:26.770
<v Speaker 5>What the fuck happened?</v>

2788
01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:27.281
<v Speaker 5>Surgery.</v>

2789
01:15:27.281 --> 01:15:28.114
<v Speaker 5>Mood.</v>

2790
01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:29.920
<v Speaker 5>I've been doing a lot of shit like,</v>

2791
01:15:29.921 --> 01:15:30.754
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2792
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:35.140
<v Speaker 5>and that's the thing that trips me out too is like these are advertised people.</v>

2793
01:15:35.141 --> 01:15:36.190
<v Speaker 5>They're just like five,</v>

2794
01:15:36.191 --> 01:15:36.611
<v Speaker 5>three,</v>

2795
01:15:36.611 --> 01:15:38.080
<v Speaker 5>or whatever that are getting the surgery.</v>

2796
01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.430
<v Speaker 5>When dwarves do it,</v>

2797
01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:42.130
<v Speaker 5>we still have the disproportionate body,</v>

2798
01:15:42.190 --> 01:15:43.540
<v Speaker 5>so you can still tell.</v>

2799
01:15:43.541 --> 01:15:43.840
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2800
01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.110
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2801
01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:47.890
<v Speaker 5>that like you don't suddenly become like a normal looking person.</v>

2802
01:15:47.891 --> 01:15:49.120
<v Speaker 5>Like you look like a dwarf.</v>

2803
01:15:49.121 --> 01:15:51.730
<v Speaker 5>It was stretched out in a fucking taffy machine.</v>

2804
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:56.170
<v Speaker 5>Like it's not like everything now fits and looks as it should.</v>

2805
01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:56.441
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2806
01:15:56.441 --> 01:15:58.180
<v Speaker 5>for someone who was a dwarf,</v>

2807
01:15:58.181 --> 01:16:01.300
<v Speaker 5>they would literally have to stretch out almost all of your body.</v>

2808
01:16:01.330 --> 01:16:01.980
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2809
01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:05.230
<v Speaker 5>It would have to be a thing where you're in constant agony arms.</v>

2810
01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.700
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

2811
01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:08.950
<v Speaker 5>they've done it on this woman.</v>

2812
01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.353
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2813
01:16:10.750 --> 01:16:11.320
<v Speaker 5>She's got,</v>

2814
01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:13.790
<v Speaker 5>she's got Achondroplasia uh,</v>

2815
01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:15.070
<v Speaker 5>on on the left.</v>

2816
01:16:15.071 --> 01:16:16.120
<v Speaker 5>But then like,</v>

2817
01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:18.250
<v Speaker 5>look at how the thighs on the right,</v>

2818
01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:22.180
<v Speaker 5>like when she's had the limb lengthening your ass and thighs are still those</v>

2819
01:16:22.181 --> 01:16:23.590
<v Speaker 5>dwarf acid and thighs,</v>

2820
01:16:23.591 --> 01:16:25.210
<v Speaker 5>which are fucking huge.</v>

2821
01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:26.501
<v Speaker 5>They're massive.</v>

2822
01:16:26.501 --> 01:16:26.980
<v Speaker 5>So that,</v>

2823
01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:27.813
<v Speaker 5>that just,</v>

2824
01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:30.310
<v Speaker 5>it looks like she has a weird thyroid problem now.</v>

2825
01:16:30.350 --> 01:16:30.440
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2826
01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:30.970
<v Speaker 5>it's also,</v>

2827
01:16:30.970 --> 01:16:31.361
<v Speaker 5>she's,</v>

2828
01:16:31.361 --> 01:16:31.991
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2829
01:16:31.991 --> 01:16:33.760
<v Speaker 5>she's only lengthen to her shins,</v>

2830
01:16:33.761 --> 01:16:34.150
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2831
01:16:34.150 --> 01:16:35.140
<v Speaker 5>Is that what happened there?</v>

2832
01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:36.153
<v Speaker 5>I think so.</v>

2833
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:38.320
<v Speaker 5>It looks like her upper legs and longer as well.</v>

2834
01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:42.130
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] limb length and knee surgery creates controversy.</v>

2835
01:16:42.730 --> 01:16:43.563
<v Speaker 5>Gee,</v>

2836
01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.201
<v Speaker 5>thanks man.</v>

2837
01:16:44.201 --> 01:16:45.820
<v Speaker 5>Creates fucking controversy.</v>

2838
01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:47.711
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

2839
01:16:47.711 --> 01:16:48.460
<v Speaker 5>here it goes.</v>

2840
01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:49.061
<v Speaker 5>Three foot,</v>

2841
01:16:49.061 --> 01:16:50.080
<v Speaker 5>10 inches tall.</v>

2842
01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.480
<v Speaker 5>Cruise associated with any challenges,</v>

2843
01:16:52.481 --> 01:16:52.661
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

2844
01:16:52.661 --> 01:16:52.870
<v Speaker 5>blah.</v>

2845
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:54.790
<v Speaker 5>I was having hip problems,</v>

2846
01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:55.361
<v Speaker 5>knee problems,</v>

2847
01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:57.640
<v Speaker 5>back problems because of how bode my legs where that's true.</v>

2848
01:16:57.641 --> 01:16:58.540
<v Speaker 5>That's what you had to deal with.</v>

2849
01:16:58.750 --> 01:17:01.990
<v Speaker 5>This is accomplished with a series of three controversial bone lengthening</v>

2850
01:17:01.991 --> 01:17:05.020
<v Speaker 5>procedures using technology developed in southern California with such</v>

2851
01:17:05.021 --> 01:17:05.531
<v Speaker 5>procedures.</v>

2852
01:17:05.531 --> 01:17:06.011
<v Speaker 5>Patients,</v>

2853
01:17:06.011 --> 01:17:08.950
<v Speaker 5>bones in the arms and legs are surgically.</v>

2854
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:10.430
<v Speaker 5>Then increased,</v>

2855
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:12.680
<v Speaker 2>increasingly separated over a period of months.</v>

2856
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:14.290
<v Speaker 2>The body generates new bone,</v>

2857
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.960
<v Speaker 2>fill the gap,</v>

2858
01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.270
<v Speaker 2>thus making the bones longer.</v>

2859
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2860
01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Does does it say what her 13 inches taller.</v>

2861
01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2862
01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2863
01:17:23.131 --> 01:17:25.800
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty hundred thousand dollars four years.</v>

2864
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2865
01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.450
<v Speaker 1>Four years to do it.</v>

2866
01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:27.901
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2867
01:17:27.901 --> 01:17:30.120
<v Speaker 1>She became 13 inches tall.</v>

2868
01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:31.170
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

2869
01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2870
01:17:32.010 --> 01:17:34.300
<v Speaker 1>for me that that would go to four from four foot,</v>

2871
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:35.780
<v Speaker 1>four to five.</v>

2872
01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Did you be like almost my height?</v>

2873
01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2874
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:38.450
<v Speaker 1>It'd be sad.</v>

2875
01:17:38.450 --> 01:17:39.283
<v Speaker 1>Just shorter than me.</v>

2876
01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:40.413
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2877
01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:41.310
<v Speaker 1>Do it,</v>

2878
01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:43.600
<v Speaker 1>but you do it.</v>

2879
01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.260
<v Speaker 1>I think if I was a small person I would just stay smiling.</v>

2880
01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:48.271
<v Speaker 1>I think it's great.</v>

2881
01:17:48.271 --> 01:17:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any problem with that.</v>

2882
01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:53.970
<v Speaker 1>If your Dick's the same size and everything that'd be out and embrace being a</v>

2883
01:17:53.971 --> 01:17:54.804
<v Speaker 1>small person.</v>

2884
01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean I like,</v>

2885
01:17:56.580 --> 01:18:00.690
<v Speaker 1>I understand the things that drive these people to do it because,</v>

2886
01:18:01.050 --> 01:18:03.030
<v Speaker 1>and like for me,</v>

2887
01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.340
<v Speaker 1>no matter what I do in this business,</v>

2888
01:18:05.490 --> 01:18:10.020
<v Speaker 1>if I become a a famous actor doing movies or whatever,</v>

2889
01:18:10.021 --> 01:18:10.920
<v Speaker 1>standup specials,</v>

2890
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:11.783
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2891
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:15.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm still gonna walk down the street and kids are still going to see me and go,</v>

2892
01:18:15.811 --> 01:18:16.201

2901
01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:28.020
<v Speaker 1>I kind of get what drives people to do it.</v>

2902
01:18:28.021 --> 01:18:30.900
<v Speaker 1>They're just so depressed and so like,</v>

2903
01:18:30.930 --> 01:18:33.540
<v Speaker 1>cause they think that's going to stop and now their lives are just going to be</v>

2904
01:18:33.541 --> 01:18:34.410
<v Speaker 1>perfect but</v>

2905
01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.760
<v Speaker 2>he's going to have that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean there's people that are beautiful that fuck with their face.</v>

2907
01:18:40.461 --> 01:18:40.801
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2908
01:18:40.801 --> 01:18:41.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2909
01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:42.140
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to name names,</v>

2910
01:18:42.141 --> 01:18:46.940
<v Speaker 2>but we know like beautiful women that have gotten their lip shot up with things</v>

2911
01:18:46.941 --> 01:18:50.480
<v Speaker 2>and fuck their faces up and people are crazy man.</v>

2912
01:18:50.481 --> 01:18:50.711
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2913
01:18:50.711 --> 01:18:53.000
<v Speaker 2>and if you start fixating on anything,</v>

2914
01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:56.300
<v Speaker 2>you start fixating on my shoulder should be like this.</v>

2915
01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I wish my shoulders were like this.</v>

2916
01:18:58.910 --> 01:19:00.030
<v Speaker 2>They need to go upper.</v>

2917
01:19:00.031 --> 01:19:00.351
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

2918
01:19:00.351 --> 01:19:00.920
<v Speaker 2>people aren't,</v>

2919
01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:01.790
<v Speaker 2>there was a video,</v>

2920
01:19:01.791 --> 01:19:02.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2921
01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:05.150
<v Speaker 2>that I was watching the other day about this guy in Brazil that almost had to</v>

2922
01:19:05.151 --> 01:19:06.140
<v Speaker 2>have his arms removed,</v>

2923
01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:09.590
<v Speaker 2>has been circulating cause he does this thing called Synthol.</v>

2924
01:19:09.591 --> 01:19:10.790
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what Synthol is?</v>

2925
01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:12.060
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

2926
01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:16.430
<v Speaker 2>body builders use it to pretend that they have bigger muscles than they are.</v>

2927
01:19:16.431 --> 01:19:21.020
<v Speaker 2>So what they do is they inject their body with this oil and this oil makes their</v>

2928
01:19:21.021 --> 01:19:23.480
<v Speaker 2>muscles bulge out and this really weird,</v>

2929
01:19:23.481 --> 01:19:24.530
<v Speaker 2>unnatural way.</v>

2930
01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.150
<v Speaker 2>And it looks like they got like,</v>

2931
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:27.403
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2932
01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:28.760
<v Speaker 2>like an infection.</v>

2933
01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:29.953
<v Speaker 2>It swells,</v>

2934
01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:31.640
<v Speaker 2>but bit by spiders.</v>

2935
01:19:31.641 --> 01:19:32.251
<v Speaker 2>This guy like that.</v>

2936
01:19:32.251 --> 01:19:33.730
<v Speaker 2>That's fuck Steven.</v>

2937
01:19:33.850 --> 01:19:34.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2938
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:39.470
<v Speaker 2>It's like he has two turtles in his shoulders.</v>

2939
01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:40.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2940
01:19:40.431 --> 01:19:42.170
<v Speaker 2>And not only the turtles,</v>

2941
01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:45.380
<v Speaker 2>like not only does he look weird and crazy,</v>

2942
01:19:45.381 --> 01:19:47.480
<v Speaker 2>but it's totally out of proportion.</v>

2943
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.033
<v Speaker 2>Like you look at his,</v>

2944
01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:51.950
<v Speaker 2>his waist and his whole thing is like,</v>

2945
01:19:51.951 --> 01:19:53.210
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is that?</v>

2946
01:19:53.211 --> 01:19:54.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're sick.</v>

2947
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:55.220
<v Speaker 2>It looks goofy.</v>

2948
01:19:55.221 --> 01:19:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Why would he think that even looks good?</v>

2949
01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:56.901
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2950
01:19:56.901 --> 01:20:00.710
<v Speaker 2>why do you think women that have giant breast implants think that those things</v>

2951
01:20:00.711 --> 01:20:01.730
<v Speaker 2>like that got like,</v>

2952
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:01.901
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

2953
01:20:01.901 --> 01:20:04.370
<v Speaker 2>I've got double D's but then I think I could go bigger.</v>

2954
01:20:04.410 --> 01:20:04.760
<v Speaker 2>Your lives.</v>

2955
01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:06.260
<v Speaker 2>A lot of women like that man.</v>

2956
01:20:06.261 --> 01:20:07.094
<v Speaker 2>It's like just like,</v>

2957
01:20:07.930 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 2>just</v>

2958
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:09.930
<v Speaker 1>like certain bodybuilders.</v>

2959
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:12.320
<v Speaker 1>People have body dysmorphia where they,</v>

2960
01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:14.670
<v Speaker 1>they look at their body and it becomes an issue.</v>

2961
01:20:14.671 --> 01:20:18.680
<v Speaker 1>They just can't stop fucking with their body and can't stop fucking with their,</v>

2962
01:20:19.020 --> 01:20:19.831
<v Speaker 1>their nose.</v>

2963
01:20:19.831 --> 01:20:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Like I know,</v>

2964
01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I know girl was ruined or nose man.</v>

2965
01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:24.570
<v Speaker 1>She had a beautiful nose.</v>

2966
01:20:24.571 --> 01:20:26.070
<v Speaker 1>It was just kind of a little big,</v>

2967
01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.000
<v Speaker 1>but she was pretty,</v>

2968
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2969
01:20:27.410 --> 01:20:28.380
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with it.</v>

2970
01:20:28.381 --> 01:20:33.360
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw her with ego and they don't see the pretty face and they got like</v>

2971
01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:34.410
<v Speaker 1>a ski slope.</v>

2972
01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:37.440
<v Speaker 1>There was something missing from the middle of her nose.</v>

2973
01:20:37.441 --> 01:20:38.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like fog.</v>

2974
01:20:38.851 --> 01:20:40.120
<v Speaker 1>We don't do the,</v>

2975
01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:43.260
<v Speaker 1>oh so crazy.</v>

2976
01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:45.600
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

2977
01:20:45.601 --> 01:20:46.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2978
01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:47.930
<v Speaker 1>I feel sorry for the people that go through it.</v>

2979
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't imagine just nitpicking so much that well you probably have a level</v>

2980
01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:54.120
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2981
01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:59.100
<v Speaker 1>of body acceptance that other people don't let me know what I'm saying.</v>

2982
01:20:59.100 --> 01:20:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Like you have,</v>

2983
01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:03.300
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount that you just have to deal with that other people don't</v>

2984
01:21:03.301 --> 01:21:04.134
<v Speaker 1>have to deal with.</v>

2985
01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:07.110
<v Speaker 1>So when you hear people complaining about like Stupid Shit,</v>

2986
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:08.940

3012
01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:40.320
<v Speaker 1>what horrible things I would do behind a dumpster to be,</v>

3013
01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:42.990
<v Speaker 1>and you're out there like,</v>

3014
01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:43.591
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>

3015
01:21:43.591 --> 01:21:43.851
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3016
01:21:43.851 --> 01:21:44.340
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

3017
01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:46.080
<v Speaker 1>like I'm starting to accept myself.</v>

3018
01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:47.850
<v Speaker 1>It's five foot four because of you.</v>

3019
01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Do you pay attention to all of the scientific research that's being done and</v>

3020
01:21:53.431 --> 01:21:55.440
<v Speaker 1>genetic engineering and changing?</v>

3021
01:21:55.530 --> 01:21:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that's on,</v>

3022
01:21:56.940 --> 01:21:57.151
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3023
01:21:57.151 --> 01:21:57.840
<v Speaker 1>like um,</v>

3024
01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.900
<v Speaker 1>they actually identified the Dwarf Jean.</v>

3025
01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Like they've been able to identify the gene that causes dwarfism and this debate</v>

3026
01:22:06.901 --> 01:22:08.310
<v Speaker 1>has gone on as their,</v>

3027
01:22:08.311 --> 01:22:11.190
<v Speaker 1>as the technology keeps getting closer to the point where we can actually do</v>

3028
01:22:11.191 --> 01:22:11.880
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

3029
01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:15.460
<v Speaker 1>But there's debate going is if we can remove that gene,</v>

3030
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:19.170
<v Speaker 1>if we can prevent your child from having tourism,</v>

3031
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:20.303
<v Speaker 1>should we,</v>

3032
01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:21.750
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of dwarves were like,</v>

3033
01:22:21.751 --> 01:22:21.931
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3034
01:22:21.931 --> 01:22:22.591
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't do it.</v>

3035
01:22:22.591 --> 01:22:23.371
<v Speaker 1>It's playing God.</v>

3036
01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:24.180
<v Speaker 1>It's stumped.</v>

3037
01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:24.690
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>

3038
01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:25.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm there going,</v>

3039
01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:26.580
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3040
01:22:26.580 --> 01:22:27.720
<v Speaker 1>you should absolutely remove it.</v>

3041
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:29.071
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

3042
01:22:29.071 --> 01:22:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Why would you want your kid to go through?</v>

3043
01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:32.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3044
01:22:32.581 --> 01:22:33.060
<v Speaker 1>granted,</v>

3045
01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:34.140
<v Speaker 1>I've been lucky at like,</v>

3046
01:22:34.141 --> 01:22:34.681
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

3047
01:22:34.681 --> 01:22:39.681
<v Speaker 1>I've only had like one surgery and I made a good career with the hand that I was</v>

3048
01:22:40.651 --> 01:22:41.370
<v Speaker 1>dealt.</v>

3049
01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:43.470
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of little people I know that,</v>

3050
01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:44.640
<v Speaker 1>that haven't,</v>

3051
01:22:44.641 --> 01:22:45.470
<v Speaker 1>that don't,</v>

3052
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:49.560
<v Speaker 1>and then he constantly made fun of their entire lives are hidden away by their</v>

3053
01:22:49.561 --> 01:22:49.951
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>

3054
01:22:49.951 --> 01:22:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Why would you want your kid to go through that and as a dwarf,</v>

3055
01:22:54.301 --> 01:22:54.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3056
01:22:54.631 --> 01:22:56.340
<v Speaker 1>what struggles that you had growing up,</v>

3057
01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.300
<v Speaker 1>why would you,</v>

3058
01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:01.290
<v Speaker 1>why would you intentionally put those pains on your child?</v>

3059
01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

3060
01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:03.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3061
01:23:03.450 --> 01:23:05.800
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to understand a lot of decisions that people make.</v>

3062
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.490
<v Speaker 1>A lot of rationalizations that people may like.</v>

3063
01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:12.910
<v Speaker 1>One reason that I'm able to be a comedian and sort of have this sense of humor</v>

3064
01:23:12.911 --> 01:23:13.211
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

3065
01:23:13.211 --> 01:23:16.390
<v Speaker 1>it's because my dad was amazing,</v>

3066
01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:17.020
<v Speaker 1>is amazing.</v>

3067
01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3068
01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:19.030
<v Speaker 1>like when I was born,</v>

3069
01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.830
<v Speaker 1>he found out that I was going to be a dwarf.</v>

3070
01:23:20.831 --> 01:23:23.500
<v Speaker 1>So he would go to these,</v>

3071
01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:23.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3072
01:23:23.890 --> 01:23:24.790
<v Speaker 1>LPA,</v>

3073
01:23:24.850 --> 01:23:29.260
<v Speaker 1>little people of America meetings and he would find out about it and he was</v>

3074
01:23:29.261 --> 01:23:29.440
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3075
01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:29.861
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

3076
01:23:29.861 --> 01:23:31.240
<v Speaker 1>my kid's going to get made fun.</v>

3077
01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Of a lot like his life is going to be weird.</v>

3078
01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:36.070
<v Speaker 1>So his philosophy was when I was growing up,</v>

3079
01:23:36.071 --> 01:23:37.630
<v Speaker 1>he would make fun of me first,</v>

3080
01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:40.000
<v Speaker 1>but he would do it in a supportive way.</v>

3081
01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Like he would fuck with me but didn't say,</v>

3082
01:23:41.471 --> 01:23:41.771
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3083
01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:42.551
<v Speaker 1>I just insulted you,</v>

3084
01:23:42.551 --> 01:23:43.510
<v Speaker 1>hit me back with something,</v>

3085
01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.020
<v Speaker 1>hit me back and then get,</v>

3086
01:23:45.090 --> 01:23:46.780
<v Speaker 1>because this is going to happen to you later.</v>

3087
01:23:47.850 --> 01:23:48.031
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>

3088
01:23:48.031 --> 01:23:49.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like training you.</v>

3089
01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:49.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3090
01:23:49.611 --> 01:23:52.090
<v Speaker 1>So by the time I got to kindergarten I like,</v>

3091
01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I remember kindergarten walking in in a a kid just laughing at me going,</v>

3092
01:23:56.911 --> 01:23:58.120
<v Speaker 1>ha ha you're little.</v>

3093
01:23:58.121 --> 01:23:58.850
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at him and went,</v>

3094
01:23:58.850 --> 01:23:59.111
<v Speaker 1>ha ha,</v>

3095
01:23:59.111 --> 01:24:02.770
<v Speaker 1>your mom doesn't live with your dad anymore and kindergarten,</v>

3096
01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:06.280
<v Speaker 1>kindergarten and fucking like I got sent to the principal's office for like,</v>

3097
01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:08.110
<v Speaker 1>like hurting this kid's feelings.</v>

3098
01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:09.130
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

3099
01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3100
01:24:09.610 --> 01:24:10.280
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

3101
01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:11.450
<v Speaker 1>and they called my dad,</v>

3102
01:24:11.451 --> 01:24:11.621
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

3103
01:24:11.621 --> 01:24:12.670
<v Speaker 1>we're going to call your father.</v>

3104
01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:13.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3105
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.870
<v Speaker 1>fucking do it.</v>

3106
01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:15.640
<v Speaker 1>He turned you to be a comedian.</v>

3107
01:24:15.641 --> 01:24:16.474
<v Speaker 1>Kind of.</v>

3108
01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Cause now like when I get a heckler,</v>

3109
01:24:18.221 --> 01:24:18.461

3110
01:24:18.461 --> 01:24:22.180
<v Speaker 1>do you think you're going to say anything to me that I haven't heard on the</v>

3111
01:24:22.181 --> 01:24:25.080
<v Speaker 1>street that I haven't heard walking down and some kid haven't.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We like saying a comment like I've had,</v>

3113
01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:33.420
<v Speaker 1>I've had parents bring their children up to me when the line is too long at the</v>

3114
01:24:34.451 --> 01:24:35.650
<v Speaker 1>mall Santa and go,</v>

3139
01:25:08.230 --> 01:25:08.531
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3140
01:25:08.531 --> 01:25:09.610
<v Speaker 1>but what happened was,</v>

3141
01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:12.430
<v Speaker 1>is this guy came up and with his kid and was like,</v>

3142
01:25:12.431 --> 01:25:14.600
<v Speaker 1>you see you saw and he's working undercover for Santa.</v>

3143
01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:15.390
<v Speaker 1>He's going to,</v>

3144
01:25:15.390 --> 01:25:18.310
<v Speaker 1>it's like he's out here seeing and finding out who's naughty and nice and he's</v>

3145
01:25:18.311 --> 01:25:19.480
<v Speaker 1>going to go back and tell.</v>

3146
01:25:19.930 --> 01:25:24.930
<v Speaker 1>And like I knew in that moment where if I get pissed off now this kid who</v>

3147
01:25:25.691 --> 01:25:26.830
<v Speaker 1>doesn't know anything about dwarfism,</v>

3148
01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:31.860
<v Speaker 1>his first interaction is going to be with someone angry and that's going to be</v>

3149
01:25:31.931 --> 01:25:33.160
<v Speaker 1>what he thinks all dwarves are.</v>

3150
01:25:33.230 --> 01:25:34.300
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be the first interaction.</v>

3151
01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.190
<v Speaker 1>So I can't get pissed off.</v>

3152
01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:38.320
<v Speaker 1>I can't get angry because that's,</v>

3153
01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:39.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm setting the precedent.</v>

3154
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:42.010
<v Speaker 1>So what I did was I looked at Kevin went,</v>

3155
01:25:42.011 --> 01:25:42.970
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely right.</v>

3156
01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:44.133
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

3157
01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:45.670
<v Speaker 1>I am working undercover.</v>

3158
01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:47.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm going around and seeing who's naughty and nice,</v>

3159
01:25:47.111 --> 01:25:47.944
<v Speaker 1>but guess what?</v>

3160
01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:48.430
<v Speaker 1>You've been,</v>

3161
01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:49.263
<v Speaker 1>you've been really good.</v>

3162
01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:50.790
<v Speaker 1>What do you want more than anything in the world?</v>

3163
01:25:50.791 --> 01:25:52.390
<v Speaker 1>And kids like I want an x box.</v>

3164
01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:53.080
<v Speaker 1>And I looked right,</v>

3165
01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:53.560
<v Speaker 1>the data went,</v>

3166
01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:53.981
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

3167
01:25:53.981 --> 01:25:57.190
<v Speaker 1>You're getting an x box and the dad and the dad's like,</v>

3168
01:25:57.191 --> 01:25:57.851
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about this.</v>

3169
01:25:57.851 --> 01:25:58.091
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

3170
01:25:58.091 --> 01:25:58.990
<v Speaker 1>what else do you want?</v>

3171
01:25:58.991 --> 01:26:00.870
<v Speaker 1>And the good that's like waving like no,</v>

3172
01:26:00.871 --> 01:26:00.941
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3173
01:26:00.941 --> 01:26:01.021
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3174
01:26:01.021 --> 01:26:01.121
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3175
01:26:01.121 --> 01:26:01.241
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3176
01:26:01.241 --> 01:26:01.630
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

3177
01:26:01.630 --> 01:26:01.871
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

3178
01:26:01.871 --> 01:26:02.950
<v Speaker 1>I really want to bike.</v>

3179
01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:03.231
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3180
01:26:03.231 --> 01:26:04.590
<v Speaker 1>you're getting a bike though.</v>

3181
01:26:04.591 --> 01:26:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Look at getting one.</v>

3182
01:26:06.610 --> 01:26:07.341
<v Speaker 1>And I told the kid,</v>

3183
01:26:07.341 --> 01:26:07.581
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3184
01:26:07.581 --> 01:26:10.100
<v Speaker 1>the only way that you don't get these things,</v>

3185
01:26:10.101 --> 01:26:13.430
<v Speaker 1>if your parents failed to file the proper paperwork.</v>

3186
01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:14.930
<v Speaker 1>So then he looks at data like,</v>

3187
01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:16.370
<v Speaker 1>did you file the proper paperwork down?</v>

3188
01:26:16.370 --> 01:26:16.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

3189
01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:16.851
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3190

<v Speaker 1>You came to get a service somewhere?</v>

3224
01:27:15.651 --> 01:27:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I forgot what show it was.</v>

3225
01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Some TV shows said it.</v>

3226
01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:19.011
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3227
01:27:19.011 --> 01:27:19.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the league.</v>

3228
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:25.330
<v Speaker 1>I think the league on on Fx said sizes and I just heard that.</v>

3229
01:27:25.611 --> 01:27:26.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm like that's pretty good.</v>

3230
01:27:26.601 --> 01:27:27.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna start using that site.</v>

3231
01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

3232
01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:30.980
<v Speaker 1>There's a million different interests.</v>

3233
01:27:31.630 --> 01:27:33.200
<v Speaker 1>It's getting weird.</v>

3234
01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Well everyone has to find a way for them to be offended.</v>

3235
01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:37.600
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

3236
01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.670
<v Speaker 1>so you have to create what a what a what applies to you.</v>

3237
01:27:40.671 --> 01:27:42.200
<v Speaker 1>So now you can complain like the rest of us,</v>

3238
01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping this is temporary.</v>

3239
01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping this ultra complainy society,</v>

3240
01:27:46.011 --> 01:27:50.270
<v Speaker 1>ultra whiny stage we're going through is just a side effect of people learning</v>

3241
01:27:50.271 --> 01:27:51.290
<v Speaker 1>how to use the internet.</v>

3242
01:27:51.650 --> 01:27:56.650
<v Speaker 1>SORTA like how people didn't know how to not get crazy on in the 90s,</v>

3243
01:27:57.230 --> 01:27:57.711
<v Speaker 1>like in the,</v>

3244
01:27:57.711 --> 01:27:58.250
<v Speaker 1>in the Internet,</v>

3245
01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:59.540
<v Speaker 1>people didn't know how to,</v>

3246
01:27:59.541 --> 01:28:00.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3247
01:28:00.260 --> 01:28:03.350
<v Speaker 1>people get upset at things and they overreact and freak out.</v>

3248
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:06.060
<v Speaker 1>They just didn't know how to deal with people insulting them.</v>

3249
01:28:07.450 --> 01:28:08.283
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3250
01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:10.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering if it's because,</v>

3251
01:28:10.221 --> 01:28:13.130
<v Speaker 1>have we gotten to a point where like,</v>

3252
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:15.920
<v Speaker 1>cause I doubt that uh,</v>

3253
01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:19.540
<v Speaker 1>in third world countries they're having a debate of should,</v>

3254
01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:21.110
<v Speaker 1>should we say bossy?</v>

3255
01:28:21.730 --> 01:28:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Like do you think those people who are trying to get food,</v>

3256
01:28:25.521 --> 01:28:26.660
<v Speaker 1>who don't have clean water,</v>

3257
01:28:26.661 --> 01:28:27.411
<v Speaker 1>who don't have good,</v>

3258
01:28:27.411 --> 01:28:29.120
<v Speaker 1>who don't have vaccinations are like,</v>

3259
01:28:29.121 --> 01:28:29.750
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3260
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:31.040
<v Speaker 1>I know all this shit's going on,</v>

3261
01:28:31.041 --> 01:28:32.900
<v Speaker 1>but we've got to stop saying that we're bossy.</v>

3262
01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Like we've got a focus on that.</v>

3263
01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:39.050
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a lack of problems and the human being is a dramatic animal.</v>

3264
01:28:39.170 --> 01:28:40.760
<v Speaker 1>So we create this,</v>

3265
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:44.540
<v Speaker 1>we create these problems that had nowhere just so we feel like we're struggling</v>

3266
01:28:44.541 --> 01:28:45.200
<v Speaker 1>against something.</v>

3267
01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.520
<v Speaker 1>There's certainly a lot of that.</v>

3268
01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Certainly a lot of people that just have a too soft too.</v>

3269
01:28:50.781 --> 01:28:52.780
<v Speaker 1>It's too easy to get like this.</v>

3270
01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:53.120
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

3271
01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:53.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3272
01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:58.330
<v Speaker 1>the ability to tweet 15 times about x men shows me that you either have no</v>

3273
01:28:59.391 --> 01:29:02.870
<v Speaker 1>fucking friends too much free time or your,</v>

3274
01:29:02.871 --> 01:29:05.130
<v Speaker 1>your career as being a cunt online.</v>

3275
01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Those things here,</v>

3276
01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:10.650
<v Speaker 1>you got family money or you just don't care about money and,</v>

3277
01:29:10.651 --> 01:29:11.570
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

3278
01:29:11.730 --> 01:29:11.940
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3279
01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:13.550
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the real problems in their lives.</v>

3280
01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:14.101
<v Speaker 1>Same people.</v>

3281
01:29:14.101 --> 01:29:14.791
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago,</v>

3282
01:29:14.791 --> 01:29:18.240
<v Speaker 1>what were they picketers and how did it didn't exist?</v>

3283
01:29:18.241 --> 01:29:19.320
<v Speaker 1>It's too hard picketing.</v>

3284
01:29:19.321 --> 01:29:20.490
<v Speaker 1>You have to actually do something.</v>

3285
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:22.220
<v Speaker 1>You have to show set up.</v>

3286
01:29:22.350 --> 01:29:23.760
<v Speaker 1>You have to love people in the eye.</v>

3287
01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:27.070
<v Speaker 1>If you're standing out inside of an abortion clinic or you're,</v>

3288
01:29:27.071 --> 01:29:28.980
<v Speaker 1>you're picketing in front of a warehouse,</v>

3289
01:29:28.981 --> 01:29:32.490
<v Speaker 1>it's nonunion and you got to make fucking contact with people.</v>

3290
01:29:32.491 --> 01:29:34.170
<v Speaker 1>You got to get her act organize.</v>

3291
01:29:34.171 --> 01:29:35.550
<v Speaker 1>You have to be good at arts and crafts.</v>

3292
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:37.890
<v Speaker 1>So you have a sign that's like halfway decent.</v>

3293
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:39.690
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do when you want online.</v>

3479
01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:56.770
<v Speaker 5>like the idea that I'll do comedians have to be miserable.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like I have friends and aren't miserable in the comedians.</v>

3482
01:35:00.351 --> 01:35:01.550

3486
01:35:03.771 --> 01:35:06.650
<v Speaker 5>or it's like you could just sit back and enjoy their art and say like,</v>

3487
01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:07.370
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3490
01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:11.870
<v Speaker 5>do you have to go into the mental state of a Jackson Pollock or can you just sit</v>

3491
01:35:11.871 --> 01:35:12.500
<v Speaker 5>back and be like,</v>

3499
01:35:19.281 --> 01:35:19.731
<v Speaker 5>are miserable.</v>

01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.920
<v Speaker 7>It</v>

3565
01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:20.020
<v Speaker 5>was the total opposite of this.</v>

3566
01:37:20.230 --> 01:37:21.580
<v Speaker 5>You saw like jumping around.</v>

3570
01:37:24.250 --> 01:37:24.970
<v Speaker 5>I was really,</v>

3571
01:37:24.970 --> 01:37:25.803
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

3572
01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:26.111
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3573
01:37:26.111 --> 01:37:27.700
<v Speaker 5>I have no musical talent at all,</v>

3574
01:37:27.701 --> 01:37:30.360
<v Speaker 5>so I love watching musicians because you've watched musicians,</v>

3575
01:37:30.361 --> 01:37:34.360
<v Speaker 5>you can kind of get this inspiration from them that's totally unrelated to what</v>

3576
01:37:34.361 --> 01:37:34.920
<v Speaker 5>you do.</v>

3577
01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:39.340
<v Speaker 5>And like I was really impressed with him as a performer just as just as an</v>

3578
01:37:39.370 --> 01:37:39.851
<v Speaker 5>artist.</v>

3579
01:37:39.851 --> 01:37:40.151
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3580
01:37:40.151 --> 01:37:43.540
<v Speaker 5>this guy's fucking bringing in because he's showing up to some,</v>

3581
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:44.010
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3582
01:37:44.010 --> 01:37:45.730
<v Speaker 5>Was showing up to some private party.</v>

3583
01:37:45.850 --> 01:37:48.370
<v Speaker 5>They probably got all fucking ass load of money she had.</v>

3584
01:37:48.371 --> 01:37:51.280
<v Speaker 5>Apparently he was a nightmare to deal with backstage.</v>

3585
01:37:51.281 --> 01:37:54.460
<v Speaker 5>They were threatening to walk if the show didn't start right now.</v>

3586
01:37:54.461 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 5>Like it was all this craziness to it.</v>

3587
01:37:55.981 --> 01:37:58.590
<v Speaker 5>Like it wasn't chill about the experience at all.</v>

3588
01:37:58.591 --> 01:37:59.424
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

3589
01:37:59.490 --> 01:37:59.970
<v Speaker 5>the one,</v>

3590
01:37:59.970 --> 01:38:00.570
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3591
01:38:00.570 --> 01:38:02.880
<v Speaker 5>maybe he's amped up to get up there because once you got up there,</v>

3592
01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:05.100
<v Speaker 5>he was fucking smashing it.</v>

3593
01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:07.590
<v Speaker 5>It was sorry it was so tight.</v>

3594
01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:12.630
<v Speaker 5>Spoons and like everything he was doing was such like energetic and focused and</v>

3595
01:38:12.730 --> 01:38:13.650
<v Speaker 5>I was super,</v>

3596
01:38:13.651 --> 01:38:14.131
<v Speaker 5>super,</v>

3597
01:38:14.131 --> 01:38:15.030
<v Speaker 5>super impressed.</v>

3598
01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:18.090
<v Speaker 5>It's cool and you can see someone who's really in their element,</v>

3599
01:38:18.091 --> 01:38:18.331
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

3600
01:38:18.331 --> 01:38:18.541
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>

3601
01:38:18.541 --> 01:38:20.570
<v Speaker 5>you were absolutely put on this planet to be a rock star.</v>

3602
01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:23.100
<v Speaker 5>Like this is what you do and you're fantastic.</v>

3603
01:38:23.150 --> 01:38:24.150
<v Speaker 5>I would never say that,</v>

3604
01:38:24.151 --> 01:38:25.830
<v Speaker 5>but I would say he's nailing it.</v>

3605
01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:26.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3606
01:38:26.060 --> 01:38:28.230
<v Speaker 5>he's whatever it is that takes to be a rock star,</v>

3607
01:38:28.231 --> 01:38:30.120
<v Speaker 5>that guy is in that groove.</v>

3608
01:38:30.121 --> 01:38:31.280
<v Speaker 5>He's in that headspace.</v>

3609
01:38:31.290 --> 01:38:32.550
<v Speaker 5>He's worked really hard.</v>

3610
01:38:32.551 --> 01:38:36.270
<v Speaker 5>He's done all the preparation necessary and he's producing it in a very,</v>

3611
01:38:36.271 --> 01:38:38.380
<v Speaker 5>very high level that that's,</v>

3612
01:38:38.430 --> 01:38:39.630
<v Speaker 5>that's one thing I definitely would say.</v>

3613
01:38:39.631 --> 01:38:43.290
<v Speaker 5>I don't think anybody's born to be a rock star or born to be a poet or any of</v>

3614
01:38:43.291 --> 01:38:43.890
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3615
01:38:43.890 --> 01:38:46.560
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of silliness when it comes to that kind of shit.</v>

3616
01:38:46.590 --> 01:38:51.000
<v Speaker 5>I think some people's personalities because of whatever reason are better suited</v>

3617
01:38:51.001 --> 01:38:52.020
<v Speaker 5>for certain activities.</v>

3618
01:38:52.021 --> 01:38:52.890
<v Speaker 5>But that makes sense.</v>

3619
01:38:53.310 --> 01:38:55.020
<v Speaker 5>I don't think anybody's born to do anything,</v>

3620
01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:55.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3621
01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:56.070
<v Speaker 5>they just,</v>

3622
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:58.290
<v Speaker 5>they just kind of discover where they kind of,</v>

3623
01:38:58.350 --> 01:39:01.740
<v Speaker 5>where their talent or where their personality can sort of fit the best and then</v>

3624
01:39:01.741 --> 01:39:02.280
<v Speaker 5>they just,</v>

3625
01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:02.760
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3626
01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:03.350
<v Speaker 5>accelerate.</v>

3627
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.601
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3628
01:39:03.601 --> 01:39:05.160
<v Speaker 5>find what you enjoy and do it.</v>

3629
01:39:05.190 --> 01:39:06.210
<v Speaker 5>I mean like for you,</v>

3630
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:06.841
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3631
01:39:06.841 --> 01:39:07.081
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3632
01:39:07.081 --> 01:39:08.100
<v Speaker 5>you're in college,</v>

3633
01:39:08.670 --> 01:39:10.650
<v Speaker 5>men see it brings you on stage.</v>

3634
01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:11.070
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

3635
01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:11.361
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3636
01:39:11.361 --> 01:39:14.160
<v Speaker 5>you say funny shit and you realize I can be funny.</v>

3637
01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:15.330
<v Speaker 5>Holy Fuck.</v>

3638
01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:16.770
<v Speaker 5>Like the next thing you know,</v>

3639
01:39:16.771 --> 01:39:16.981
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3640
01:39:16.981 --> 01:39:17.880
<v Speaker 5>what was that process like?</v>

3641
01:39:17.881 --> 01:39:19.110
<v Speaker 5>Did you get home and start writing?</v>

3642
01:39:19.111 --> 01:39:20.370
<v Speaker 5>Did you start watching comedy?</v>

3643
01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:21.120
<v Speaker 5>Like what did you do?</v>

3644
01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:22.140
<v Speaker 5>Consumed everything.</v>

3645
01:39:22.740 --> 01:39:23.573
<v Speaker 5>One moment.</v>

3646
01:39:23.670 --> 01:39:24.503
<v Speaker 5>One Blip.</v>

3647
01:39:25.110 --> 01:39:28.110
<v Speaker 5>Just cause I got a laugh and it was,</v>

3648
01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:29.910
<v Speaker 5>it was a sold out.</v>

3649
01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.250
<v Speaker 5>It was a sold out improv and I was just like,</v>

3650
01:39:32.251 --> 01:39:32.580
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

3651
01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:33.590
<v Speaker 5>this is in,</v>

3652
01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:34.231
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3653
01:39:34.231 --> 01:39:34.561
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3654
01:39:34.561 --> 01:39:34.951
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3655
01:39:34.951 --> 01:39:35.371
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

3656
01:39:35.371 --> 01:39:39.420
<v Speaker 5>the drug of standup of being on stage and sang something and then having a whole</v>

3657
01:39:39.421 --> 01:39:39.790
<v Speaker 5>room,</v>

3658
01:39:39.790 --> 01:39:41.220
<v Speaker 5>a stranger is just laugh.</v>

3659
01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:42.083
<v Speaker 5>And it was,</v>

3660
01:39:42.150 --> 01:39:43.050
<v Speaker 5>and that,</v>

3661
01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:44.100
<v Speaker 5>and for me,</v>

3662
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:48.750
<v Speaker 5>I've always used laughter is like kind of a defense mechanism because when I,</v>

3663
01:39:48.910 --> 01:39:50.010
<v Speaker 5>when I meet people,</v>

3664
01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:53.550
<v Speaker 5>I try to immediately make a dwarf joke just so they're comfortable just so they</v>

3665
01:39:53.551 --> 01:39:54.090
<v Speaker 5>like go like,</v>

3666
01:39:54.090 --> 01:39:54.390
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3667
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.601
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3668
01:39:54.601 --> 01:39:55.434
<v Speaker 5>he's cool with it.</v>

3669
01:39:55.670 --> 01:39:56.550
<v Speaker 5>And then I can kind of,</v>

3670
01:39:56.551 --> 01:39:57.930
<v Speaker 5>and now and now we can be friends.</v>

3671
01:39:57.960 --> 01:39:59.310
<v Speaker 5>Like now we can move on past that.</v>

3672
01:39:59.790 --> 01:40:00.480
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3673
01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:03.330
<v Speaker 5>so that's like something you learned over the years.</v>

3674
01:40:04.010 --> 01:40:05.850
<v Speaker 5>It has to do with the way your dad sort of like,</v>

3675
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:06.743
<v Speaker 5>absolutely.</v>

3676
01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:07.261
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

3677
01:40:07.261 --> 01:40:07.930
<v Speaker 5>Because,</v>

3678
01:40:07.930 --> 01:40:09.040
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>

3679
01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:11.190
<v Speaker 5>cause then if I don't talk about it,</v>

3680
01:40:11.191 --> 01:40:13.500
<v Speaker 5>then people are like on pins and needles because they don't know if they're</v>

3681
01:40:13.501 --> 01:40:16.920
<v Speaker 5>going to offend me or if they're going to like say something that's going to set</v>

3682
01:40:16.921 --> 01:40:17.290
<v Speaker 5>me off,</v>

3683
01:40:17.290 --> 01:40:17.611
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3684
01:40:17.611 --> 01:40:18.444
<v Speaker 5>so there,</v>

3685
01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:20.250
<v Speaker 5>so if I make that quick joke,</v>

3686
01:40:20.260 --> 01:40:20.710
<v Speaker 5>then they're like,</v>

3687
01:40:20.710 --> 01:40:21.470
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3688
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:22.020
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

3689
01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:22.853
<v Speaker 5>you're fine.</v>

3690
01:40:23.010 --> 01:40:23.520
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3691
01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:24.450
<v Speaker 5>I don't have to worry about it.</v>

3692
01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:25.590
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3693
01:40:25.590 --> 01:40:26.280
<v Speaker 5>so yeah,</v>

3694
01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:27.180
<v Speaker 5>as soon as I went on stage,</v>

3695
01:40:27.181 --> 01:40:29.820
<v Speaker 5>the first time I went home and I just started writing like crazy and just</v>

3696
01:40:29.821 --> 01:40:33.150
<v Speaker 5>started writing all the stories that I've told it parties for years,</v>

3697
01:40:33.151 --> 01:40:34.920
<v Speaker 5>just of experiences and,</v>

3698
01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:36.390
<v Speaker 5>and things like that.</v>

3699
01:40:36.391 --> 01:40:38.100
<v Speaker 5>And you started watching a ton of comedy.</v>

3700
01:40:38.101 --> 01:40:41.400
<v Speaker 5>Someone showed me that Jerry Seinfeld documentary,</v>

3701
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:42.630
<v Speaker 5>a comedian,</v>

3702
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:43.500
<v Speaker 5>and I was like,</v>

3703
01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:44.430
<v Speaker 5>I was an man.</v>

3704
01:40:44.610 --> 01:40:46.080
<v Speaker 5>That's a sneaky documentary.</v>

3705
01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:46.981
<v Speaker 5>You know why?</v>

3706
01:40:46.981 --> 01:40:50.400
<v Speaker 5>Because he put [inaudible] Adams in that movie to make himself look good.</v>

3707
01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:52.140
<v Speaker 5>I know he did.</v>

3708
01:40:52.650 --> 01:40:54.400
<v Speaker 5>I know he put already like already,</v>

3709
01:40:54.401 --> 01:40:54.810
<v Speaker 5>like he,</v>

3710
01:40:54.810 --> 01:40:56.440
<v Speaker 5>they focused on like what?</v>

3711
01:40:56.890 --> 01:40:58.450
<v Speaker 5>They come to you and they say,</v>

3712
01:40:58.451 --> 01:40:59.260
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

3713
01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:02.080
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be at a documentary about comedy with Jerry Seinfeld.</v>

3714
01:41:02.150 --> 01:41:02.500
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3715
01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:03.520
<v Speaker 5>fuck yeah man,</v>

3716
01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:04.990
<v Speaker 5>you're a struggling comic.</v>

3717
01:41:05.230 --> 01:41:09.850
<v Speaker 5>And they narrow in on this neurotic guy.</v>

3718
01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:10.720
<v Speaker 5>It was a mess.</v>

3719
01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:12.330
<v Speaker 5>And he's freaking out and he's trying to get,</v>

3720
01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:13.210
<v Speaker 5>and they just,</v>

3721
01:41:13.210 --> 01:41:16.520
<v Speaker 5>he's got no experience being on camera and you just fucking shove this Cameron</v>

3722
01:41:17.110 --> 01:41:18.340
<v Speaker 5>and then contrast it.</v>

3723
01:41:18.341 --> 01:41:20.020
<v Speaker 5>Makes Jerry Seinfeld look very,</v>

3724
01:41:20.050 --> 01:41:20.790
<v Speaker 5>very likely.</v>

3725
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:24.970
<v Speaker 5>He's polished and he's done this for years and now he's trying to do the new</v>

3726
01:41:24.971 --> 01:41:25.481
<v Speaker 5>act.</v>

3727
01:41:25.481 --> 01:41:26.220
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

3728
01:41:26.220 --> 01:41:26.530
<v Speaker 5>Eh.</v>

3729
01:41:26.530 --> 01:41:27.970
<v Speaker 5>But then at the same time like,</v>

3730
01:41:27.971 --> 01:41:28.721
<v Speaker 5>and then as comics,</v>

3731
01:41:28.721 --> 01:41:29.680
<v Speaker 5>we know this now,</v>

3732
01:41:29.890 --> 01:41:30.790
<v Speaker 5>like yeah,</v>

3733
01:41:30.791 --> 01:41:32.680
<v Speaker 5>Jerry Seinfeld was trying to write new material,</v>

3734
01:41:32.681 --> 01:41:35.110
<v Speaker 5>but w w and when he's going on stage,</v>

3735
01:41:35.111 --> 01:41:36.670
<v Speaker 5>like he's done this a thousand times.</v>

3736
01:41:36.671 --> 01:41:39.940
<v Speaker 5>So that scene where he's essentially trying to think of a word or a bombing as</v>

3737
01:41:39.941 --> 01:41:40.780
<v Speaker 5>some people would say,</v>

3738
01:41:41.050 --> 01:41:44.560
<v Speaker 5>he's very comfortable in that scenario because he knows what to do.</v>

3739
01:41:44.590 --> 01:41:48.220
<v Speaker 5>And he's very analytical cause he's done it a million times.</v>

3740
01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:50.740
<v Speaker 5>It's not already to wear when he goes on,</v>

3741
01:41:50.741 --> 01:41:51.250
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

3742
01:41:51.250 --> 01:41:51.551
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3743
01:41:51.551 --> 01:41:54.990
<v Speaker 5>he's neurotic and he's learning all this stuff because yeah,</v>

3744
01:41:55.030 --> 01:41:55.900
<v Speaker 5>I saw that movie.</v>

3745
01:41:55.900 --> 01:41:56.410
<v Speaker 5>I thought I,</v>

3746
01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:57.280
<v Speaker 5>I thought I knew Warren,</v>

3747
01:41:57.281 --> 01:41:57.940
<v Speaker 5>he Adams.</v>

3748
01:41:57.940 --> 01:41:59.020
<v Speaker 5>And then I actually met the guy,</v>

3749
01:41:59.021 --> 01:41:59.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3750
01:41:59.410 --> 01:42:00.190
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3751
01:42:00.190 --> 01:42:01.023
<v Speaker 5>you're fucking cool.</v>

3752
01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:02.160
<v Speaker 5>It's just a normal dude.</v>

3753
01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:03.220
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

3754
01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:04.090
<v Speaker 5>they edit it,</v>

3755
01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:08.640
<v Speaker 5>they focus on all the most ridiculous shit does get their cameras phase.</v>

3756
01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:11.110
<v Speaker 5>You have Barry Katz breaking you down on camera,</v>

3757
01:42:11.111 --> 01:42:13.600
<v Speaker 5>which is a posture as the whole thing.</v>

3758
01:42:14.670 --> 01:42:15.161
<v Speaker 5>I saw that,</v>

3759
01:42:15.161 --> 01:42:15.401
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3760
01:42:15.401 --> 01:42:19.600
<v Speaker 5>they set this dude up like they used him and his fucking documentary.</v>

3761
01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:20.950
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>

3762
01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:24.520
<v Speaker 5>if you really going to show a guy creating a new material or guy,</v>

3763
01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:27.220
<v Speaker 5>you got to kind of do a guy who is not loved already.</v>

3764
01:42:27.670 --> 01:42:28.330
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3765
01:42:28.330 --> 01:42:28.791
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3766
01:42:28.791 --> 01:42:32.740
<v Speaker 5>you can't walk on stage and get a standing ovation before you've said one word.</v>

3767
01:42:32.741 --> 01:42:34.150
<v Speaker 5>So that's where [inaudible] comes in.</v>

3768
01:42:34.151 --> 01:42:34.451
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3769
01:42:34.451 --> 01:42:35.290
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>

3770
01:42:35.530 --> 01:42:36.580
<v Speaker 5>I think they kinda,</v>

3771
01:42:36.820 --> 01:42:39.910
<v Speaker 5>it helps to have a guy like that we can follow following another guy,</v>

3772
01:42:39.911 --> 01:42:40.744
<v Speaker 5>but on the way up,</v>

3773
01:42:40.930 --> 01:42:42.010
<v Speaker 5>why did they choose or [inaudible],</v>

3774
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.903
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3775
01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:45.190
<v Speaker 5>choose the guy who's not going to overshadow him.</v>

3776
01:42:45.730 --> 01:42:46.563
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3777
01:42:47.110 --> 01:42:47.771
<v Speaker 5>it's interesting like,</v>

3778
01:42:47.771 --> 01:42:48.071
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3779
01:42:48.071 --> 01:42:52.600
<v Speaker 5>they didn't do like a Kevin Hart type character or some big powerful energetic</v>

3780
01:42:52.601 --> 01:42:54.550
<v Speaker 5>performer would just crushes and like,</v>

3781
01:42:54.551 --> 01:42:54.911
<v Speaker 5>well hell,</v>

3782
01:42:54.911 --> 01:42:55.451
<v Speaker 5>they have all this.</v>

3783
01:42:55.451 --> 01:42:58.480
<v Speaker 5>They had the one scene at a Caroline's where,</v>

3784
01:42:58.481 --> 01:42:59.650
<v Speaker 5>I don't know who the comic was.</v>

3785
01:42:59.651 --> 01:43:00.281
<v Speaker 5>It might've been an angel.</v>

3786
01:43:00.281 --> 01:43:01.114
<v Speaker 5>Cells are,</v>

3787
01:43:01.330 --> 01:43:02.190
<v Speaker 5>but it got out.</v>

3788
01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:02.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3789
01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:02.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3790
01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:03.670
<v Speaker 5>Chicago chicken out.</v>

3791
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:04.331
<v Speaker 5>We're like,</v>

3792
01:43:04.331 --> 01:43:07.000
<v Speaker 5>he was doing his costume changes on stage at,</v>

3793
01:43:07.210 --> 01:43:07.451
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3794
01:43:07.451 --> 01:43:08.284
<v Speaker 5>I think it was Caroline's.</v>

3795
01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.060
<v Speaker 5>And then you see Jerry in the back like,</v>

3796
01:43:10.210 --> 01:43:10.331
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

3797

3815
01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:25.900
<v Speaker 5>I just consumed all things comedy.</v>

3816
01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:27.730
<v Speaker 5>I never saw that I am comic either.</v>

3817
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:28.331
<v Speaker 5>It was just,</v>

3818
01:43:28.331 --> 01:43:30.880
<v Speaker 5>that was the documentary that everybody always quotes because that's the one</v>

3819
01:43:30.881 --> 01:43:31.400
<v Speaker 5>where I'm in.</v>

3820
01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:33.340
<v Speaker 5>He admits the steel in material and he does that.</v>

3821
01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:35.080
<v Speaker 5>That interview was talking about.</v>

3822
01:43:35.650 --> 01:43:35.921
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3824
01:43:36.491 --> 01:43:37.330
<v Speaker 5>Of course I steal.</v>

3825
01:43:37.750 --> 01:43:37.961
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3826
01:43:37.961 --> 01:43:39.700
<v Speaker 5>if I'm on stage you better run bitch.</v>

3827
01:43:42.090 --> 01:43:43.490
<v Speaker 5>I was sarcastic.</v>

3828
01:43:44.530 --> 01:43:45.880
<v Speaker 5>I think it was doing to be sarcastic.</v>

3829
01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:47.620
<v Speaker 5>Can't do that if you actually are.</v>

3830
01:43:47.630 --> 01:43:47.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3831
01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:51.680
<v Speaker 5>that's how do you do that if you actually are a plagiarist.</v>

3832
01:43:51.681 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's,</v>

3833
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:53.180
<v Speaker 5>that's preposterous.</v>

3834
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.823
<v Speaker 5>But that's how,</v>

3835
01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:56.450
<v Speaker 5>that's all I know about that documentary.</v>

01:44:06.690 --> 01:44:10.100
<v Speaker 5>and we're still friends and so we still text every now and then.</v>

3846
01:44:10.110 --> 01:44:10.690
<v Speaker 5>Hell.</v>

3847

<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3849

<v Speaker 5>Nothing wrong with him doing stand up.</v>

3867
01:44:43.180 --> 01:44:44.290
<v Speaker 5>Cause you know that's not,</v>

3868
01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:45.710
<v Speaker 5>there was never the issue.</v>

3869
01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:51.460
<v Speaker 5>What the issue always was was he was victimizing other comedians and you might</v>

3870
01:44:52.671 --> 01:44:54.530
<v Speaker 5>not known it because you weren't around.</v>

3871
01:44:54.590 --> 01:44:56.360
<v Speaker 5>I went around the scene,</v>

3872
01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.661
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>

3873
01:44:56.661 --> 01:44:59.310
<v Speaker 5>I like mystery and,</v>

3874
01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:00.350
<v Speaker 5>and this,</v>

3875
01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:03.380
<v Speaker 5>and the sad part is is cause because I was with him on the road,</v>

3876
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:07.640
<v Speaker 5>I would see things happen during the day and then him go on stage that night,</v>

3877
01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:12.740
<v Speaker 5>do 20 minutes on what happened during the day and have it be brilliant stuff.</v>

3878
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:17.930
<v Speaker 5>I'll be the first one to say he's a great comic when he's like being a comedian,</v>

3879
01:45:18.050 --> 01:45:18.920
<v Speaker 5>you know what the problem is?</v>

3880
01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:22.220
<v Speaker 5>People get addicted to killing and they want to kill all the time.</v>

3881
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:23.960
<v Speaker 5>And when they don't have something to say,</v>

3882
01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:25.880
<v Speaker 5>they'll take somebody else's shit.</v>

3883
01:45:26.150 --> 01:45:27.320
<v Speaker 5>And that's the reality of it.</v>

3884
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:29.030
<v Speaker 5>It's a lack of artistic integrity.</v>

3885
01:45:29.110 --> 01:45:29.871
<v Speaker 5>And that's the reality.</v>

3886
01:45:29.871 --> 01:45:31.040
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't mean you're not talented.</v>

3887
01:45:31.250 --> 01:45:32.360
<v Speaker 5>It's like we were talking about before,</v>

3888
01:45:32.361 --> 01:45:33.320
<v Speaker 5>there's grays,</v>

3889
01:45:33.710 --> 01:45:35.180
<v Speaker 5>there's not everybody's good,</v>

3890
01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:36.860
<v Speaker 5>everybody's bad or you know,</v>

3891
01:45:36.861 --> 01:45:38.630
<v Speaker 5>everybody on this side is good everybody and that's how it's bad.</v>

3892
01:45:38.631 --> 01:45:40.760
<v Speaker 5>It's not that some people are really talented,</v>

3893
01:45:40.761 --> 01:45:41.690
<v Speaker 5>but they're,</v>

3894
01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:44.830
<v Speaker 5>they also have questionable ethics and that's,</v>

3895
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:45.681
<v Speaker 5>that's reality.</v>

3896
01:45:45.681 --> 01:45:49.580
<v Speaker 5>And because what is most important to them is adulation and love.</v>

3897
01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:51.200
<v Speaker 5>It's filling up that hole.</v>

3898
01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:53.150
<v Speaker 5>Whatever that hold it was created.</v>

3899
01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:54.490
<v Speaker 5>We all have a whole,</v>

3900
01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:57.470
<v Speaker 5>every comic has a hole that was created by their childhood.</v>

3901
01:45:57.770 --> 01:45:58.790
<v Speaker 5>Some more than others.</v>

3902
01:45:58.820 --> 01:45:59.031
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>

3903
01:45:59.031 --> 01:45:59.390
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3904
01:45:59.390 --> 01:45:59.870
<v Speaker 5>some,</v>

3905
01:45:59.870 --> 01:46:01.340
<v Speaker 5>some in a different way than others.</v>

3906
01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:02.173
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's,</v>

3907
01:46:02.180 --> 01:46:03.320
<v Speaker 5>everybody's varies.</v>

3908
01:46:03.710 --> 01:46:08.710
<v Speaker 5>And some people that the need to kill is way more important than the need to be</v>

3909
01:46:09.231 --> 01:46:10.910
<v Speaker 5>original and the need to be creative.</v>

3910
01:46:11.390 --> 01:46:13.430
<v Speaker 5>And when they don't have anything to say,</v>

3911
01:46:13.610 --> 01:46:14.151
<v Speaker 5>when they don't,</v>

3912
01:46:14.151 --> 01:46:14.984
<v Speaker 5>they can't.</v>

3913
01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:16.520
<v Speaker 5>They can't find something.</v>

3914
01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:17.750
<v Speaker 5>They'll just steal.</v>

3915
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:19.190
<v Speaker 5>And once they steal,</v>

3916
01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:23.130
<v Speaker 5>they steal all the time and one state that becomes what they do then.</v>

3917
01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:24.920
<v Speaker 5>And they do it to their friends.</v>

3918
01:46:24.921 --> 01:46:26.540
<v Speaker 5>They do it to people they don't know.</v>

3919
01:46:26.541 --> 01:46:29.480
<v Speaker 5>They do it to open Miker as they sit in the back room and they write things down</v>

3920
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:31.640
<v Speaker 5>and he's not the only one that's ever done this.</v>

3921
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:35.180
<v Speaker 5>He was the only one that was ever called out for it and got busted for it.</v>

3922
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:36.320
<v Speaker 5>Public and publicly.</v>

3923
01:46:36.321 --> 01:46:36.650
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3924
01:46:36.650 --> 01:46:37.340
<v Speaker 5>Cause you know,</v>

3925
01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:39.380
<v Speaker 5>and these things still happen today where,</v>

3926
01:46:39.381 --> 01:46:39.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3927
01:46:39.710 --> 01:46:41.930
<v Speaker 5>behind the scenes someone comes up Sean and says,</v>

3928
01:46:41.931 --> 01:46:43.170
<v Speaker 5>hey look,</v>

3929
01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:43.510
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

3930
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:44.690
<v Speaker 5>it's still an issue.</v>

3931
01:46:44.850 --> 01:46:47.720
<v Speaker 5>Like artistic integrity is always going to be an issue.</v>

3932
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:50.220
<v Speaker 5>There's for sure parallel thinking</v>

3933
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:50.911
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

3934
01:46:50.911 --> 01:46:51.570
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3935
01:46:51.570 --> 01:46:53.820
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be people that come up with similar jokes.</v>

3936
01:46:53.821 --> 01:46:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Like there's always something that happens in the news,</v>

3937
01:46:56.191 --> 01:47:01.191
<v Speaker 1>like Kanye West interrupting Taylor Swift's is going to be a bunch of people</v>

3938
01:47:02.521 --> 01:47:04.070
<v Speaker 1>that have a joke about that.</v>

3939
01:47:04.090 --> 01:47:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I see with Twitter you'll see it because I met when,</v>

3940
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3941
01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I remember when Bruce Jenner,</v>

3942
01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:09.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3943
01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.260
<v Speaker 1>gotten to that car accident and,</v>

3944
01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:12.273
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

3945
01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:13.320
<v Speaker 1>and the woman died.</v>

3946
01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:17.220
<v Speaker 1>One of the first tweets I saw was Neal Brennan saying,</v>

3947
01:47:17.490 --> 01:47:17.970
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

3948
01:47:17.970 --> 01:47:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Now every comics going to say that,</v>

3949
01:47:20.521 --> 01:47:21.354
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3950
01:47:21.420 --> 01:47:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Jenner's really becoming a woman because he can't drive.</v>

3951
01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:26.610
<v Speaker 1>And that like that was his tweet and then sure enough,</v>

3952
01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:31.170
<v Speaker 1>within minutes you saw Comedians tweet that joke like sure.</v>

3953
01:47:31.230 --> 01:47:34.490
<v Speaker 1>It just filled up the line because that's the most obvious punchline there.</v>

3954
01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3955
01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Like you have all these eyes looking to one topic.</v>

3956
01:47:38.401 --> 01:47:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3957
01:47:38.610 --> 01:47:39.840
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're going to come up with.</v>

3958
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:41.180
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty fucked up that they,</v>

3959
01:47:41.190 --> 01:47:43.680
<v Speaker 1>did they even bring that up in the two hours that no.</v>

3960
01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3961
01:47:44.230 --> 01:47:45.180
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3962
01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:48.030
<v Speaker 1>by not paying attention.</v>

3963
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.903
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3964
01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3965
01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:50.350
<v Speaker 1>and it was taught,</v>

3966
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean anybody else in that similar situation like that would be the main focal</v>

3967
01:47:54.511 --> 01:47:55.020
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

3968
01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh by the way,</v>

3969
01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:00.240
<v Speaker 1>you fucking weren't paying attention while you were driving giant truck with a</v>

3970
01:48:00.241 --> 01:48:01.830
<v Speaker 1>fucking boat behind it,</v>

3971
01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:03.180
<v Speaker 1>which I used to mashed.</v>

3972
01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:04.110
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

3973
01:48:04.110 --> 01:48:07.440
<v Speaker 1>I think on the PCAS that somebody said that you're not supposed to have trailers</v>

3974
01:48:07.441 --> 01:48:10.800
<v Speaker 1>or something on that street because of that reason.</v>

3975
01:48:10.801 --> 01:48:12.450
<v Speaker 1>I've stopped being fast Google that.</v>

3976
01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Find out if that's true,</v>

3977
01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:14.580
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if that's true.</v>

3978
01:48:15.060 --> 01:48:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Could be true.</v>

3979
01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:19.050
<v Speaker 1>You could have done the Diane Sawyer interview on the fact that you fucking</v>

3980
01:48:19.051 --> 01:48:20.280
<v Speaker 1>killed someone a month ago.</v>

3981
01:48:22.410 --> 01:48:23.220
<v Speaker 1>A month ago.</v>

3982
01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3983
01:48:23.670 --> 01:48:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Glossed over it like it was,</v>

3984
01:48:24.901 --> 01:48:25.621
<v Speaker 1>that's not important.</v>

3985
01:48:25.621 --> 01:48:30.621
<v Speaker 1>What's important is a woman are you a woman and kills people by negligence,</v>

3986
01:48:32.590 --> 01:48:35.670
<v Speaker 1>by pure negligence while you're smoking his cigarette.</v>

3987
01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:37.470
<v Speaker 1>And I think I heard,</v>

3988
01:48:37.471 --> 01:48:37.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3989
01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:41.640
<v Speaker 1>I heard a her Corolla talk about this and I thought it was really interesting.</v>

3990
01:48:41.641 --> 01:48:42.474
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3991
01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:47.460
<v Speaker 1>the fact that like I think the car he hit and then she veered off into oncoming</v>

3992
01:48:47.461 --> 01:48:49.000
<v Speaker 1>traffic and the car that hit her,</v>

3993
01:48:49.001 --> 01:48:51.470
<v Speaker 1>it was like a homer and that,</v>

3994
01:48:51.510 --> 01:48:52.920
<v Speaker 1>that part sucks cause you're like,</v>

3995
01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:53.611
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3996
01:48:53.611 --> 01:48:54.930
<v Speaker 1>if you get hit by a yard,</v>

3997
01:48:55.980 --> 01:48:56.813
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

3998
01:48:56.940 --> 01:48:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Ars Ars is a,</v>

3999
01:48:58.940 --> 01:48:59.371
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

4000
01:48:59.371 --> 01:49:00.204
<v Speaker 1>it's a little,</v>

4001
01:49:00.570 --> 01:49:01.410
<v Speaker 1>little tiny car.</v>

4002
01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:02.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not that,</v>

4003
01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:03.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4004
01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:04.693
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

4005
01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:05.161
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

4006
01:49:05.161 --> 01:49:05.311
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4007
01:49:05.311 --> 01:49:08.220
<v Speaker 1>you get hit by any sort of regular to pull up a yard.</v>

4008
01:49:08.450 --> 01:49:09.000
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>

4009
01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:09.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

4010
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:11.880
<v Speaker 1>it taped the interview before the car accident it says,</v>

4011
01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.470
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4012
01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:15.090
<v Speaker 1>well there you go.</v>

4013
01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:15.953
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

4014
01:49:16.270 --> 01:49:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4015
01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:17.430
<v Speaker 1>so okay.</v>

4016
01:49:17.490 --> 01:49:17.671
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4017
01:49:17.671 --> 01:49:18.000
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

4018
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:18.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4019
01:49:18.151 --> 01:49:18.720
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

4020
01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean that makes them kind of like an asterisk tapered so long ago.</v>

4021
01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:22.801
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4022
01:49:22.801 --> 01:49:23.341
<v Speaker 1>And then not,</v>

4023
01:49:23.341 --> 01:49:25.020
<v Speaker 1>and then just sit on it.</v>

4024
01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4025
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:26.623
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

4026
01:49:27.380 --> 01:49:27.840
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

4027
01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:28.800
<v Speaker 1>it gives a fuck really.</v>

4028
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:32.430
<v Speaker 1>But it was the whole thing of where like out of all the cars on the road that</v>

4029
01:49:32.431 --> 01:49:33.091
<v Speaker 1>hit you head on,</v>

4030
01:49:33.091 --> 01:49:35.040
<v Speaker 1>it had to be a hummer and that's not good.</v>

4031
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:35.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4032
01:49:35.790 --> 01:49:38.070
<v Speaker 1>it's just negligence like that.</v>

4033
01:49:38.071 --> 01:49:40.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just so infuriating and to have it,</v>

4034
01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:42.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4035
01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:44.220
<v Speaker 1>from a person that's in the public guy,</v>

4036
01:49:44.221 --> 01:49:45.480
<v Speaker 1>people get really angry about it.</v>

4037
01:49:45.481 --> 01:49:46.260
<v Speaker 1>But in this set,</v>

4038
01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 1>in this case it seems to be</v>

4039
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:48.821
<v Speaker 5>like fading.</v>

4040
01:49:48.821 --> 01:49:52.770
<v Speaker 5>Like no one really seems to give a shit about it other than the people that</v>

4041
01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:53.740
<v Speaker 5>directly knew and they're like,</v>

4042
01:49:53.741 --> 01:49:55.090
<v Speaker 5>there's people that are trying to sue,</v>

4043
01:49:55.091 --> 01:49:57.910
<v Speaker 5>but then the stepdaughters and apparently they didn't even have a relationship</v>

4044
01:49:57.911 --> 01:49:59.170
<v Speaker 5>with a woman and they're suing.</v>

4045
01:49:59.230 --> 01:49:59.490
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

4046
01:49:59.490 --> 01:49:59.720
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4047
01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:00.740
<v Speaker 5>but you took away their,</v>

4048
01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:04.120
<v Speaker 5>my chance to rekindle that relationship so I deserve $1 million.</v>

4049
01:50:04.330 --> 01:50:09.330
<v Speaker 5>It was kind of the true God who the fuck is to say that I was going to call her</v>

4050
01:50:09.941 --> 01:50:10.480
<v Speaker 5>tomorrow.</v>

4051
01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:14.860
<v Speaker 5>If there's anybody that deserves like money from like a lawsuit.</v>

4052
01:50:14.890 --> 01:50:18.130
<v Speaker 5>It's not the people suing Manny Pacquiao for 5 million bucks cause he had a hurt</v>

4053
01:50:18.131 --> 01:50:18.964
<v Speaker 5>shoulder.</v>

4054
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:20.140
<v Speaker 5>It's the people who,</v>

4055
01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:20.450
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4056
01:50:20.450 --> 01:50:20.591
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

4057
01:50:20.591 --> 01:50:21.910
<v Speaker 5>Bruce Jenner killed my mom.</v>

4058
01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:23.260
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

4059
01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:23.810
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4060
01:50:23.810 --> 01:50:24.051
<v Speaker 5>sorry,</v>

4061
01:50:24.051 --> 01:50:24.884
<v Speaker 5>I got some money.</v>

4062
01:50:25.010 --> 01:50:25.310
<v Speaker 5>He's,</v>

4063
01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:26.350
<v Speaker 5>it's not only these broke.</v>

4064
01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:27.693
<v Speaker 5>Let's keep that.</v>

4065
01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:28.870
<v Speaker 5>Let's give you some money for that.</v>

4066
01:50:29.290 --> 01:50:29.980
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

4067
01:50:29.980 --> 01:50:32.830
<v Speaker 5>and you almost never hear about that anymore.</v>

4068
01:50:32.860 --> 01:50:34.090
<v Speaker 5>You don't hear about the fact that he,</v>

4069
01:50:34.091 --> 01:50:35.140
<v Speaker 5>it's all hear about it at all.</v>

4070
01:50:35.141 --> 01:50:35.321
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4071
01:50:35.321 --> 01:50:37.390
<v Speaker 5>it's just in becoming a woman now fades away.</v>

4072
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:38.680
<v Speaker 5>It fades away into oblivion.</v>

4073
01:50:39.010 --> 01:50:43.080
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting how the public decides to fixate on certain things and not fix</v>

4074
01:50:43.081 --> 01:50:43.960
<v Speaker 5>it on other things.</v>

4075
01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:48.400
<v Speaker 5>Like I was thinking about that when it came to this police violence case,</v>

4076
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:49.091
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4077
01:50:49.091 --> 01:50:52.060
<v Speaker 5>the public will decide which one to Freddie gray one.</v>

4078
01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:53.200
<v Speaker 5>There's one that sticks,</v>

4079
01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:57.580
<v Speaker 5>but this South Carolina one where the cops shot the guy in the back on video</v>

4080
01:50:57.581 --> 01:50:58.630
<v Speaker 5>just wanting away.</v>

4081
01:50:58.631 --> 01:50:59.710
<v Speaker 5>The guy was running away.</v>

4082
01:50:59.730 --> 01:51:00.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4083
01:51:00.070 --> 01:51:02.170
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't a guy who died in the back of a van.</v>

4084
01:51:02.290 --> 01:51:04.600
<v Speaker 5>It was a guy who's running away and the cop shoots.</v>

4085
01:51:04.610 --> 01:51:04.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

4086
01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:05.500
<v Speaker 5>come on.</v>

4087
01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:06.760
<v Speaker 5>That one didn't stick.</v>

4088
01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:08.140
<v Speaker 5>I am shocked.</v>

4089
01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:08.711
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4090
01:51:08.711 --> 01:51:09.580
<v Speaker 5>it's like a,</v>

4091
01:51:09.970 --> 01:51:14.380
<v Speaker 5>it was kind of like a few years ago and all these,</v>

4092
01:51:14.620 --> 01:51:16.150
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of comics made jokes about it,</v>

4093
01:51:16.151 --> 01:51:17.580
<v Speaker 5>but it was like whenever he,</v>

4094
01:51:17.770 --> 01:51:19.510
<v Speaker 5>when it was like missing kid time,</v>

4095
01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:20.910
<v Speaker 5>it was like we're this,</v>

4096
01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:22.810
<v Speaker 5>every story is going to be a new missing kid.</v>

4097
01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:27.340
<v Speaker 5>And everyone made the joke that was all like good looking white women and not</v>

4098
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:28.110
<v Speaker 5>just girls.</v>

4099
01:51:28.110 --> 01:51:31.300
<v Speaker 5>There's so many other missing kids and now it's Kinda like that.</v>

4100
01:51:31.301 --> 01:51:32.830
<v Speaker 5>But with police brutality,</v>

4101
01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:37.570
<v Speaker 5>like it's almost like the news just sits down one day and says,</v>

4102
01:51:37.620 --> 01:51:39.130
<v Speaker 5>why are we going to focus on this week?</v>

4103
01:51:39.190 --> 01:51:39.490
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

4104
01:51:39.490 --> 01:51:39.970
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4105
01:51:39.970 --> 01:51:40.810
<v Speaker 5>like what's going to happen?</v>

4106
01:51:40.811 --> 01:51:41.860
<v Speaker 5>Did you see nightcrawler?</v>

4107
01:51:42.170 --> 01:51:43.003
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4108
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.990
<v Speaker 5>That's a perfect,</v>

4109
01:51:44.620 --> 01:51:45.940
<v Speaker 5>perfect movie.</v>

4110
01:51:45.970 --> 01:51:48.340
<v Speaker 5>If you want to understand like this whole,</v>

4111
01:51:48.430 --> 01:51:49.650
<v Speaker 5>like this leads,</v>

4112
01:51:49.651 --> 01:51:52.300
<v Speaker 5>it leads style of news.</v>

4113
01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:55.930
<v Speaker 5>Well it also gives you really a real insight into what,</v>

4114
01:51:56.110 --> 01:51:57.640
<v Speaker 5>what a new show is.</v>

4115
01:51:57.670 --> 01:51:59.440
<v Speaker 5>It's an entertainment program.</v>

4116
01:51:59.500 --> 01:52:00.490
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to get ratings.</v>

4117
01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:01.560
<v Speaker 5>Same way everyone else is you.</v>

4118
01:52:01.570 --> 01:52:03.220
<v Speaker 5>They're not trying to enlighten you,</v>

4119
01:52:03.221 --> 01:52:04.780
<v Speaker 5>they're not trying to educate you.</v>

4120
01:52:04.781 --> 01:52:08.740
<v Speaker 5>They are just trying to somehow or another get you to pay attention.</v>

4121
01:52:09.250 --> 01:52:10.140
<v Speaker 5>That's why I like a,</v>

4122
01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:11.113
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4123
01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:13.900
<v Speaker 5>the speech and the TV show,</v>

4124
01:52:13.901 --> 01:52:14.770
<v Speaker 5>the newsroom.</v>

4125
01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:15.663
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4126
01:52:15.670 --> 01:52:17.170
<v Speaker 5>it was near the beginning of the first season,</v>

4127
01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:17.890
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4128
01:52:17.890 --> 01:52:21.670
<v Speaker 5>Jeff Daniels plays the news broadcaster and he talks about what the news was</v>

4129
01:52:21.671 --> 01:52:26.110
<v Speaker 5>designed to be and how there were people that when the news was first conceived,</v>

4130
01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:26.530
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

4131
01:52:26.530 --> 01:52:27.221
<v Speaker 5>they said,</v>

4132
01:52:27.221 --> 01:52:28.060
<v Speaker 5>no ads,</v>

4133
01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:29.410
<v Speaker 5>no sponsors,</v>

4134
01:52:29.890 --> 01:52:32.200
<v Speaker 5>government funded or I mean,</v>

4135
01:52:32.230 --> 01:52:35.660
<v Speaker 5>how then you go and do a whole nother part where they can't talk about different</v>

4136
01:52:35.661 --> 01:52:35.861
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

4137
01:52:35.861 --> 01:52:36.551
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

4138
01:52:36.551 --> 01:52:39.900
<v Speaker 5>it's like a no sponsors to where they have to get ratings just right.</v>

4139
01:52:39.930 --> 01:52:41.350
<v Speaker 5>This is the news.</v>

4140
01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:43.690
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be put on by taxpayer money.</v>

4141
01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:44.830
<v Speaker 5>You pay a little extra,</v>

4142
01:52:45.170 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 5>get you get the news.</v>

4144
01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:49.190
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4145
01:52:49.190 --> 01:52:51.050
<v Speaker 5>the news ticker at the bottom,</v>

4146
01:52:51.051 --> 01:52:53.030
<v Speaker 5>trying to sensationalize everything.</v>

4147
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:56.070
<v Speaker 5>What did Hillary Clinton really mean when she said Bubba,</v>

4148
01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:56.550
<v Speaker 5>Bubba,</v>

4149
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.810
<v Speaker 5>Bubba,</v>

4150
01:52:56.810 --> 01:52:59.540
<v Speaker 5>Mclaren's are Democrats and they're fighting and like,</v>

4151
01:52:59.690 --> 01:53:02.480
<v Speaker 5>so the news casters don't have that to go to.</v>

4152
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:06.200
<v Speaker 5>And I thought that was a great little monologue that made,</v>

4153
01:53:06.590 --> 01:53:07.550
<v Speaker 5>that made me kind of think like,</v>

4154
01:53:07.551 --> 01:53:07.881
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4155
01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:08.600
<v Speaker 5>why do we,</v>

4156
01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:10.820
<v Speaker 5>like why is the news have to be ratings?</v>

4157
01:53:10.821 --> 01:53:12.080
<v Speaker 5>Cause and it's like you said,</v>

4158
01:53:12.110 --> 01:53:14.350
<v Speaker 5>it's an entertainment show and it's all it is.</v>

4159
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:15.740
<v Speaker 5>At the end of the day,</v>

4160
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.460
<v Speaker 5>the traffic,</v>

4161
01:53:16.460 --> 01:53:17.840
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to get eyes to try there,</v>

4162
01:53:17.850 --> 01:53:18.860
<v Speaker 5>try and get sponsors.</v>

4163
01:53:18.861 --> 01:53:19.694
<v Speaker 5>They're trying to get,</v>

4164
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.020
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to get ratings.</v>

4165
01:53:21.050 --> 01:53:21.381
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

4166
01:53:21.381 --> 01:53:23.520
<v Speaker 5>you're going to lead with uh,</v>

4167
01:53:23.650 --> 01:53:24.170
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4168
01:53:24.170 --> 01:53:27.480
<v Speaker 5>does sensationalized murders and the a,</v>

4169
01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:29.030
<v Speaker 5>that's how you get people to pay attention.</v>

4170
01:53:29.031 --> 01:53:29.840
<v Speaker 5>It's the only way.</v>

4171
01:53:29.840 --> 01:53:31.610
<v Speaker 5>It's also like what we were talking about earlier.</v>

4172
01:53:31.611 --> 01:53:36.611
<v Speaker 5>It's like when you run into like most people that you communicate with online,</v>

4173
01:53:37.311 --> 01:53:38.144
<v Speaker 5>like my,</v>

4174
01:53:38.150 --> 01:53:43.150
<v Speaker 5>my interactions with people on Twitter and on Instagram or Facebook are almost</v>

4175
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:45.080
<v Speaker 5>universally positive.</v>

4176
01:53:45.081 --> 01:53:47.150
<v Speaker 5>There's very few negative people,</v>

4177
01:53:47.180 --> 01:53:48.013
<v Speaker 5>but I've run into,</v>

4178
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:49.040
<v Speaker 5>and most of his,</v>

4179
01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:52.010
<v Speaker 5>because I'm nice and I don't cause too much bullshit,</v>

4180
01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:54.080
<v Speaker 5>but I say controversial shit.</v>

4181
01:53:54.100 --> 01:53:54.521
<v Speaker 5>She just,</v>

4182
01:53:54.521 --> 01:53:56.030
<v Speaker 5>I run into enough nice people,</v>

4183
01:53:56.031 --> 01:53:57.890
<v Speaker 5>but there's a certain percentage that are just,</v>

4184
01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:01.040
<v Speaker 5>and it's just a numbers game.</v>

4185
01:54:01.540 --> 01:54:02.150
<v Speaker 5>Well when you,</v>

4186
01:54:02.150 --> 01:54:03.470
<v Speaker 5>when you're dealing with the news,</v>

4187
01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:09.280
<v Speaker 5>if you try to put on an hour show and you're dealing with the events of 7</v>

4188
01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:14.150
<v Speaker 5>billion people and the Nepal earthquake and the typhoon that hit the</v>

4189
01:54:14.151 --> 01:54:14.984
<v Speaker 5>Philippines,</v>

4190
01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:18.740
<v Speaker 5>this and the that and the that and the this and the murder and the dads and the</v>

4191
01:54:18.741 --> 01:54:22.700
<v Speaker 5>cop and the shot and the boy and the baby and the window,</v>

4192
01:54:22.701 --> 01:54:27.701
<v Speaker 5>and you can just fill that hour up with these events because the sheer numbers,</v>

4193
01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:29.990
<v Speaker 5>if you just looked out,</v>

4194
01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:34.130
<v Speaker 5>if you opened up your window and you looked at your apartment and you saw 7</v>

4195
01:54:34.130 --> 01:54:34.491
<v Speaker 5>billion people,</v>

4196
01:54:34.491 --> 01:54:35.001
<v Speaker 5>you'd be like,</v>

4197
01:54:35.001 --> 01:54:35.420
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4198
01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:37.970
<v Speaker 5>of course some shit's going down.</v>

4199
01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:39.560
<v Speaker 5>There's too many people.</v>

4200
01:54:40.090 --> 01:54:41.180
<v Speaker 5>It's going to happen.</v>

4201
01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:42.950
<v Speaker 5>And the events that you're dealing with,</v>

4202
01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:48.010
<v Speaker 5>if you're dealing with even like one 100th of 1% of chaos and violence,</v>

4203
01:54:49.390 --> 01:54:49.760
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

4204
01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:50.840
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty good.</v>

4205
01:54:50.841 --> 01:54:53.150
<v Speaker 5>When you consider what the world must have been like,</v>

4206
01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:53.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4207
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:54.111
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>

4208
01:54:54.111 --> 01:54:55.190
<v Speaker 5>6,000 years ago,</v>

4209
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:59.570
<v Speaker 5>people just fucking show up and you cut your village in half with swords and</v>

4210
01:54:59.571 --> 01:55:00.051
<v Speaker 5>then just say,</v>

4211
01:55:00.051 --> 01:55:00.321
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

4212
01:55:00.321 --> 01:55:01.010
<v Speaker 5>we own it now.</v>

4213
01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.341
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4214
01:55:01.341 --> 01:55:04.430
<v Speaker 5>Flaming Arrows to go flying into the algorithm and doing this again.</v>

4215
01:55:04.730 --> 01:55:05.270
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4216
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:06.440
<v Speaker 5>that was the news.</v>

4217
01:55:06.470 --> 01:55:06.621
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

4218
01:55:06.621 --> 01:55:08.690
<v Speaker 5>that was what the news was back then.</v>

4219
01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:11.390
<v Speaker 5>The news was you open up your window and people are trying to kill you here.</v>

4220
01:55:11.870 --> 01:55:13.130
<v Speaker 5>Here's who your king is now.</v>

4221
01:55:13.170 --> 01:55:13.760
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

4222
01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:14.450
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>

4223
01:55:14.450 --> 01:55:18.260
<v Speaker 5>So if you try to like pack a 7 billion person,</v>

4224
01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:22.940
<v Speaker 5>like a report on the events of 7 billion people,</v>

4225
01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:25.310
<v Speaker 5>how the fuck are you going to do that in an hour?</v>

4226
01:55:25.340 --> 01:55:27.830
<v Speaker 5>You're not and you're not getting an hour by the way,</v>

4227
01:55:27.831 --> 01:55:28.790
<v Speaker 5>you get 44 minutes,</v>

4228
01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:29.881
<v Speaker 5>the commercial,</v>

4229
01:55:29.881 --> 01:55:32.780
<v Speaker 5>the minutes or 16 minutes commercials and they're like,</v>

4230
01:55:32.781 --> 01:55:33.890
<v Speaker 5>the news is biased and you're like,</v>

4231
01:55:33.891 --> 01:55:34.251
<v Speaker 5>well yeah,</v>

4232
01:55:34.251 --> 01:55:35.120
<v Speaker 5>for that reason,</v>

4233
01:55:35.121 --> 01:55:37.700
<v Speaker 5>because they have to look at all events and say,</v>

4234
01:55:37.701 --> 01:55:39.320
<v Speaker 5>which ones do we want to focus on?</v>

4235
01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:39.531
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4236
01:55:39.531 --> 01:55:40.060
<v Speaker 5>data there,</v>

4237
01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:41.900
<v Speaker 5>their job is not to educate,</v>

4238
01:55:41.901 --> 01:55:42.734
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4239
01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:44.280
<v Speaker 5>their job is to get you to pay attention.</v>

4240
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:44.731
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

4241
01:55:44.731 --> 01:55:47.730
<v Speaker 2>And we have this idea that somehow or another they're like our educators,</v>

4242
01:55:47.930 --> 01:55:49.140
<v Speaker 2>not like this is the news.</v>

4243
01:55:49.141 --> 01:55:53.940
<v Speaker 2>And you know when you hear them talking in that strange way that news casters</v>

4244
01:55:53.941 --> 01:55:55.740
<v Speaker 2>talk calm Brokaw voice.</v>

4245
01:55:55.860 --> 01:55:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4246
01:55:56.310 --> 01:56:00.720
<v Speaker 2>It's my favorite is when they uncomfortably tried to comment on things in</v>

4247
01:56:00.721 --> 01:56:01.470
<v Speaker 2>between storage.</v>

4248
01:56:01.470 --> 01:56:02.520
<v Speaker 2>Well that's upsetting,</v>

4249
01:56:02.730 --> 01:56:04.170
<v Speaker 2>but it certainly is</v>

4250
01:56:04.570 --> 01:56:05.403
<v Speaker 8>next door.</v>

4251
01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:07.460
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

4252
01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:12.460
<v Speaker 8>the local news broadcast like after the last story and that 20 seconds at the</v>

4253
01:56:14.651 --> 01:56:18.880
<v Speaker 8>end of the broadcast where they have to like be funny or just interact.</v>

4254
01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:21.340
<v Speaker 8>Did you see that one where</v>

4255
01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:24.090
<v Speaker 2>the a woman was talking to a black guy?</v>

4256
01:56:24.091 --> 01:56:25.530
<v Speaker 2>There was a woman who was a white,</v>

4257
01:56:25.710 --> 01:56:29.400
<v Speaker 2>a newscaster and she had a black eye with her and they were talking about lady</v>

4258
01:56:29.401 --> 01:56:29.971
<v Speaker 2>Gaga.</v>

4259
01:56:29.971 --> 01:56:34.971
<v Speaker 2>Lady Gaga did a performance and she starts calling it Jigaboo Mu Music to see</v>

4260
01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.280
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't know what Jigaboo is apparently.</v>

4261
01:56:38.670 --> 01:56:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen that?</v>

4262
01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:40.380
<v Speaker 4>Listen to this</v>

4263
01:56:42.750 --> 01:56:43.141
<v Speaker 4>course.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's Fox News</v>

4265
01:56:45.550 --> 01:56:49.450
<v Speaker 4>and called it listen,</v>

4266
01:56:50.370 --> 01:56:51.203
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

4267
01:57:00.670 --> 01:57:01.503
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

4268
01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:03.361
<v Speaker 4>How about the black?</v>

4269
01:57:03.361 --> 01:57:04.110

4274
01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:15.440
<v Speaker 8>I didn't know it was racist to say,</v>

<v Speaker 8>hey boy to a black guy.</v>

01:57:30.620 --> 01:57:31.160
<v Speaker 8>Guy,</v>

4290
01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:31.993
<v Speaker 8>hey man.</v>

4291
01:57:32.150 --> 01:57:32.690
<v Speaker 8>He goes,</v>

4292
01:57:32.690 --> 01:57:33.200
<v Speaker 8>do you know what?</v>

4293
01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:34.930
<v Speaker 8>You shouldn't say boy to a black a hit.</v>

4294
01:57:34.940 --> 01:57:35.960
<v Speaker 8>And then he explained to me like,</v>

4295
01:57:36.110 --> 01:57:37.490
<v Speaker 8>I've never heard this before in my life.</v>

4296
01:57:37.820 --> 01:57:40.340
<v Speaker 8>Well now we're going through that with a trainee.</v>

4297
01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:41.470
<v Speaker 8>Like you can't,</v>

4298
01:57:41.470 --> 01:57:44.720
<v Speaker 8>like you can still say cabbie though for cab drivers.</v>

4299
01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:45.620
<v Speaker 8>So cling to that.</v>

4300
01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:47.841
<v Speaker 8>They won't,</v>

4301
01:57:47.841 --> 01:57:50.480
<v Speaker 8>they won't even exist in another few years after Uber.</v>

4302
01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:53.900
<v Speaker 8>Like did I tell you I took a cab the other day,</v>

4303
01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:58.370
<v Speaker 8>I did not know how much more expensive it was and how bitter they have.</v>

4304
01:57:58.400 --> 01:57:59.570
<v Speaker 8>Like the second I got in there,</v>

4305
01:57:59.630 --> 01:58:02.300
<v Speaker 8>that's all they talked about was how horrible Uber was.</v>

4306
01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:03.441
<v Speaker 8>Uber.</v>

4307
01:58:03.441 --> 01:58:03.621
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

4308
01:58:03.621 --> 01:58:04.310
<v Speaker 8>I had no,</v>

4309
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.731
<v Speaker 8>I didn't say.</v>

4310
01:58:04.731 --> 01:58:05.060
<v Speaker 8>And I was like,</v>

4311
01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:05.893
<v Speaker 8>oh thanks man.</v>

4312
01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:06.500
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

4313
01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:06.590
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

4314
01:58:06.590 --> 01:58:07.060
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4315
01:58:07.060 --> 01:58:12.060
<v Speaker 8>my phone's dead so I couldn't call Uber so I couldn't so I couldn't call because</v>

4316
01:58:12.831 --> 01:58:13.071
<v Speaker 8>I was,</v>

4317
01:58:13.071 --> 01:58:16.080
<v Speaker 8>I had to flag down a taxi and uh,</v>

4318
01:58:16.081 --> 01:58:17.320
<v Speaker 8>it has like my phones,</v>

4319
01:58:17.340 --> 01:58:19.190
<v Speaker 8>I couldn't call a and he goes,</v>

4320
01:58:19.191 --> 01:58:20.780
<v Speaker 8>oh that's the word Uber.</v>

4321
01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:21.920
<v Speaker 8>And the whole time,</v>

4322
01:58:21.921 --> 01:58:22.670
<v Speaker 8>the whole ride home,</v>

4323
01:58:22.670 --> 01:58:24.080
<v Speaker 8>he was just bitching about Uber.</v>

4324
01:58:24.081 --> 01:58:24.320
<v Speaker 8>Sure.</v>

4325
01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:25.820
<v Speaker 8>Cause they had a monopoly in the market.</v>

4326
01:58:25.821 --> 01:58:27.620
<v Speaker 8>Then someone figured out how to do it better.</v>

4327
01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:32.680
<v Speaker 8>And you ran into a cunt and it was $20 more like it costs are the same run.</v>

4328
01:58:34.430 --> 01:58:34.641
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4329
01:58:34.641 --> 01:58:35.331
<v Speaker 8>For the exact same.</v>

4330
01:58:35.331 --> 01:58:35.511
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

4331
01:58:35.511 --> 01:58:37.340
<v Speaker 8>I've taken a million times with Uber,</v>

4332
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:38.330
<v Speaker 8>20 hours more.</v>

4333
01:58:38.710 --> 01:58:39.543
<v Speaker 2>How do the,</v>

4334
01:58:39.550 --> 01:58:40.600
<v Speaker 2>how do they get paid?</v>

4335
01:58:40.630 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 2>They get a check from Uber.</v>

4336
01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:42.911
<v Speaker 5>Is that how that works?</v>

4337
01:58:42.911 --> 01:58:43.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4338
01:58:43.090 --> 01:58:44.290
<v Speaker 5>I think it's twice a month.</v>

4339
01:58:44.291 --> 01:58:46.050
<v Speaker 5>It's direct deposited into their,</v>

4340
01:58:46.051 --> 01:58:48.640
<v Speaker 5>you do any background checks on the people that are involved?</v>

4341
01:58:48.641 --> 01:58:48.850
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4342
01:58:48.850 --> 01:58:49.683
<v Speaker 8>Boasts two.</v>

4343
01:58:49.890 --> 01:58:52.570
<v Speaker 8>And now with all the latest news and stuff,</v>

4344
01:58:52.571 --> 01:58:54.070
<v Speaker 8>it's gotten more intense.</v>

4345
01:58:54.071 --> 01:58:54.641
<v Speaker 8>But uh,</v>

4346
01:58:54.641 --> 01:58:55.450
<v Speaker 8>it's still,</v>

4347
01:58:55.450 --> 01:58:56.560
<v Speaker 8>it's still easy.</v>

4348
01:58:56.561 --> 01:58:56.780
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

4349
01:58:56.780 --> 01:59:00.430
<v Speaker 8>I know a ton of people who are comics that are Uber drivers and I was like,</v>

4350
01:59:00.431 --> 01:59:00.761
<v Speaker 8>what?</v>

4351
01:59:00.761 --> 01:59:01.600
<v Speaker 8>You're driver?</v>

4352
01:59:04.250 --> 01:59:05.870
<v Speaker 5>Well David Seaman was a,</v>

4353
01:59:05.890 --> 01:59:06.590
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

01:59:07.290 --> 01:59:09.650
<v Speaker 5>He does some fucking Uber driving in his spare time.</v>

4356
01:59:09.670 --> 01:59:10.800
<v Speaker 5>That's just the pickup chicks.</v>

4357
01:59:10.801 --> 01:59:12.480
<v Speaker 5>I remember when dead mouse was doing it.</v>

4358
01:59:12.520 --> 01:59:12.750
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>

4359
01:59:12.750 --> 01:59:17.430
<v Speaker 5>we were driving up in Toronto and they had his logo.</v>

4360
01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:19.140
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't have to hit the car logo.</v>

4361
01:59:19.170 --> 01:59:21.530
<v Speaker 5>Like he was the 10 house mask and yeah,</v>

4362
01:59:21.630 --> 01:59:23.370
<v Speaker 5>that was odd that that was on the map.</v>

4363
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:28.350
<v Speaker 5>Like that must be cool as fuck dead mouse and trip driven around in a Ferrari.</v>

4364
01:59:28.560 --> 01:59:29.610
<v Speaker 5>What if you have luggage though?</v>

4365

<v Speaker 5>Like some clips from the documentary,</v>

4398
02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:30.510
<v Speaker 5>but oh my God,</v>

4399
02:00:30.511 --> 02:00:31.500
<v Speaker 5>I watched it last night.</v>

4400
02:00:31.501 --> 02:00:32.700
<v Speaker 5>That is incredible.</v>

4401
02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:36.060
<v Speaker 5>You know Scientology is down to only 50,000 members.</v>

4402
02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:36.953
<v Speaker 5>That's what they were saying.</v>

4403
02:00:37.180 --> 02:00:41.430
<v Speaker 5>And with that they still have whatever dollars they have over a billion dollars</v>

4404
02:00:41.431 --> 02:00:42.750
<v Speaker 5>in care.</v>

4405
02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:45.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean there was a equity there.</v>

4406
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:49.590
<v Speaker 5>There was like two sponsored tweets today that I saw like by ontology,</v>

4407
02:00:49.591 --> 02:00:50.520

<v Speaker 5>they and what's their Twitter handle?</v>

4409
02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:58.290
<v Speaker 5>I think it's just that Scientology or at Church of Scientology or at we will</v>

4410
02:00:58.291 --> 02:00:58.951
<v Speaker 5>control you.</v>

4411
02:00:58.951 --> 02:01:01.300
<v Speaker 5>You small weak minded amp or something.</v>

4412
02:01:01.340 --> 02:01:02.173
<v Speaker 5>Something like that.</v>

4413
02:01:02.430 --> 02:01:03.263
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4414
02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:04.373
<v Speaker 5>and uh,</v>

4415
02:01:04.600 --> 02:01:05.510
<v Speaker 5>Scientology.</v>

4416
02:01:05.620 --> 02:01:06.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4417
02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:06.950
<v Speaker 5>How many people that have?</v>

4418
02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:08.970
<v Speaker 5>28,000.</v>

4419
02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:09.451
<v Speaker 5>Damn,</v>

4420
02:01:09.451 --> 02:01:09.960
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

4421
02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:10.291
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

4422
02:01:10.291 --> 02:01:11.124
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

4423
02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:12.030
<v Speaker 5>I have more followers.</v>

4424
02:01:12.031 --> 02:01:13.710
<v Speaker 5>A Scientology route.</v>

02:01:13.950 --> 02:01:15.090
<v Speaker 5>28,000.</v>

4426
02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:15.840
<v Speaker 5>But like,</v>

4427
02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:17.640
<v Speaker 5>look what their top photo is like.</v>

4428
02:01:17.641 --> 02:01:22.641
<v Speaker 5>Their top photo of the Church of Scientology is a lobby of a hotel or building</v>

4429
02:01:24.571 --> 02:01:26.400
<v Speaker 5>that looks like a palace.</v>

4430
02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:28.260
<v Speaker 5>Like that's what their logo is.</v>

4431
02:01:28.350 --> 02:01:29.370

4434
02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:34.793
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4435

4436
02:01:35.780 --> 02:01:38.580
<v Speaker 5>Heikki a mother and scientologist.</v>

4442
02:01:48.841 --> 02:01:50.690
<v Speaker 5>Look at this because of Scientology.</v>

4443
02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:54.350
<v Speaker 5>May Yuku treats her young son as an individual.</v>

4444
02:01:54.410 --> 02:01:55.191

02:01:56.930 --> 02:02:00.440
<v Speaker 5>As opposed to what you treat him like he's a fucking puzzle piece.</v>

4448

<v Speaker 5>What does that mean?</v>

4493
02:03:23.690 --> 02:03:24.141
<v Speaker 5>but I said,</v>

4494
02:03:24.141 --> 02:03:24.231
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4495
02:03:24.231 --> 02:03:25.064
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to watch this.</v>

4496
02:03:25.100 --> 02:03:26.000
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>

4497
02:03:26.001 --> 02:03:27.140
<v Speaker 5>it was late at night and I was like,</v>

4498
02:03:27.170 --> 02:03:28.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm just going to watch this for like 10 15 minutes.</v>

4499
02:03:29.050 --> 02:03:29.720
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>

4500
02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:33.650
<v Speaker 5>I was going to Lou to that motherfucker for two whole hours.</v>

4501
02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:36.200
<v Speaker 5>It's sad to men,</v>

4502
02:03:36.201 --> 02:03:39.830
<v Speaker 5>some of the people's bad experiences with their children or with their family.</v>

4503
02:03:39.831 --> 02:03:43.550
<v Speaker 5>It's being taken away and being forced to work on top of the roof of a building.</v>

4504
02:03:43.551 --> 02:03:44.420
<v Speaker 5>Fuck Dude.</v>

4505
02:03:44.421 --> 02:03:48.710
<v Speaker 5>It was how the mother whose daughter won't talk to her anymore and the whole</v>

4506
02:03:48.711 --> 02:03:53.090
<v Speaker 5>family grew up Scientologists and it's really hard to watch.</v>

4507
02:03:53.150 --> 02:03:54.800
<v Speaker 5>And then the guy who started taping,</v>

4508
02:03:54.801 --> 02:03:56.570
<v Speaker 5>the people that were out in front of his house,</v>

4509
02:03:56.571 --> 02:03:59.090
<v Speaker 5>like the Scientologists out front of his house to do a smear campaign against</v>

4510
02:03:59.091 --> 02:03:59.180
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

4511
02:03:59.180 --> 02:04:01.910
<v Speaker 5>I think it's really important whenever you're talking about something like this</v>

4512
02:04:01.911 --> 02:04:05.060
<v Speaker 5>to look at both sides of it and just does not look at both sides.</v>

4513
02:04:05.450 --> 02:04:07.190
<v Speaker 5>This is only one side of it.</v>

4514
02:04:07.191 --> 02:04:08.500
<v Speaker 5>I had a neighbor that was a Scientology,</v>

4515
02:04:08.630 --> 02:04:11.300
<v Speaker 5>actually I don't think he is anymore and I don't live near him anymore,</v>

4516
02:04:11.630 --> 02:04:13.430
<v Speaker 5>but he was a scientologist.</v>

4517
02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:17.200
<v Speaker 5>He was the nicest fucking guy and he was telling me how much it helped them,</v>

4518
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.841
<v Speaker 5>how much it,</v>

4519
02:04:17.841 --> 02:04:19.340
<v Speaker 5>it got his life in order.</v>

4520
02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:22.280
<v Speaker 5>So I don't think it's all negative.</v>

4521
02:04:22.630 --> 02:04:23.463
<v Speaker 5>I think there's,</v>

4522
02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:25.940
<v Speaker 5>there's some horror fucking stories.</v>

4523
02:04:25.970 --> 02:04:26.361
<v Speaker 5>Well sure.</v>

4524
02:04:26.361 --> 02:04:27.890
<v Speaker 5>It's the same thing like uh,</v>

4525
02:04:27.950 --> 02:04:31.490
<v Speaker 5>like some of the nicest people I've ever known in my life were Mormons.</v>

4526
02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:32.953
<v Speaker 5>Mormons are great.</v>

4527
02:04:33.670 --> 02:04:34.140
<v Speaker 5>Fantastic.</v>

4528
02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:35.090
<v Speaker 5>Her religion I would,</v>

4529
02:04:35.230 --> 02:04:36.500
<v Speaker 5>I really would pick more minutes.</v>

4530
02:04:36.770 --> 02:04:37.603
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>

4531
02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:38.100
<v Speaker 5>I mean</v>

4532
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:39.900
<v Speaker 2>they're all family oriented.</v>

4533
02:04:40.230 --> 02:04:43.410
<v Speaker 2>They all like kept like tight knit or they try to have tight knit families.</v>

4534
02:04:43.411 --> 02:04:44.770
<v Speaker 2>They really like supportive.</v>

4535
02:04:44.970 --> 02:04:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Their church functions are pretty pretty and they'll and they all kind of band</v>

4536
02:04:49.261 --> 02:04:50.640
<v Speaker 2>together to help each other.</v>

4537
02:04:50.641 --> 02:04:50.821
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4538
02:04:50.821 --> 02:04:55.821
<v Speaker 2>granted then you have the instances were polygamists and girls are being married</v>

4539
02:04:56.671 --> 02:04:59.820
<v Speaker 2>off at age 12 and like some sort of weird sex though.</v>

4540
02:04:59.970 --> 02:05:00.691
<v Speaker 2>Mormonism,</v>

4541
02:05:00.691 --> 02:05:02.340
<v Speaker 2>they don't really have those though.</v>

4542
02:05:02.730 --> 02:05:02.950
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

4543
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:03.460
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

4544
02:05:03.460 --> 02:05:03.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4545
02:05:03.720 --> 02:05:04.551
<v Speaker 2>that's Mitt Romney.</v>

4546
02:05:04.551 --> 02:05:06.120
<v Speaker 2>Do you know how the whole deal with Mitt Romney?</v>

4547
02:05:06.270 --> 02:05:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

4548
02:05:07.010 --> 02:05:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh this is great.</v>

4549
02:05:09.230 --> 02:05:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4550
02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:14.380
<v Speaker 2>this is my dad's like a hardcore Republicans and Mitt Romney's dad couldn't be</v>

4551
02:05:15.541 --> 02:05:17.820
<v Speaker 2>president because he was born in Mexico.</v>

4552
02:05:18.090 --> 02:05:21.900
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I was born in Mexico was because Mitt Romney's family is from an</v>

4553
02:05:21.901 --> 02:05:23.680
<v Speaker 2>extreme sect of,</v>

4554
02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:24.960
<v Speaker 2>of Mormonism.</v>

4555
02:05:24.961 --> 02:05:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Then left the country when polygamy became illegal.</v>

4556
02:05:29.130 --> 02:05:33.660
<v Speaker 2>So it left the country in the 18 hundreds back when there was no cars when they</v>

4557
02:05:33.661 --> 02:05:33.791
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>

4558
02:05:33.791 --> 02:05:34.470
<v Speaker 2>there was no cars.</v>

4559
02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:36.120
<v Speaker 2>Mexico is just as cool as America.</v>

4560
02:05:36.121 --> 02:05:37.170
<v Speaker 2>It was probably even cooler.</v>

4561
02:05:37.380 --> 02:05:37.600
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

4562
02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:38.550
<v Speaker 2>let's just go over there.</v>

4563
02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:39.151
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

4564
02:05:39.151 --> 02:05:39.361
<v Speaker 2>We're on.</v>

4565
02:05:39.361 --> 02:05:40.890
<v Speaker 2>Horses would write one on differences.</v>

4566
02:05:40.891 --> 02:05:42.060
<v Speaker 2>May cause this land in the land.</v>

4567
02:05:42.110 --> 02:05:42.281
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4568
02:05:42.281 --> 02:05:43.200
<v Speaker 2>you have a horse over here.</v>

4569
02:05:43.201 --> 02:05:44.034
<v Speaker 2>You have almost over there.</v>

4570
02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:44.821
<v Speaker 2>Have a worse over here.</v>

4571
02:05:44.821 --> 02:05:45.990
<v Speaker 2>You could have 15 wives,</v>

4572
02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:46.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4573
02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:47.520

4578
02:05:54.481 --> 02:05:55.314
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck out of here.</v>

4579
02:05:55.680 --> 02:05:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Let's go up 15.</v>

4580
02:05:56.730 --> 02:05:59.010
<v Speaker 2>So Mitt Romney and his family,</v>

4581
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4582
02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:01.640
<v Speaker 2>they came from this one sec in this,</v>

4583
02:06:01.990 --> 02:06:06.000
<v Speaker 2>they're heavily armed and they fight off the fucking towel or not the Taliban,</v>

4584
02:06:06.030 --> 02:06:09.690
<v Speaker 2>the drug cartels down there like they get kidnapped and Shit.</v>

4585
02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:11.850
<v Speaker 2>It's like extreme shit.</v>

4586
02:06:12.090 --> 02:06:13.050
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole,</v>

4587
02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:15.570
<v Speaker 2>the whole scene is like really dangerous.</v>

4588
02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:16.411
<v Speaker 2>These guys are like,</v>

4589
02:06:16.411 --> 02:06:17.490
<v Speaker 2>they have rifles everywhere.</v>

4590
02:06:17.491 --> 02:06:17.941
<v Speaker 2>They're gone.</v>

4591
02:06:17.941 --> 02:06:18.090
<v Speaker 2>They'll,</v>

4592
02:06:18.090 --> 02:06:21.330
<v Speaker 2>they're always worried the drug cartels are going to storm the gates.</v>

4593
02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:22.070
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4594
02:06:22.070 --> 02:06:23.160
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting.</v>

4595
02:06:23.161 --> 02:06:24.550
<v Speaker 2>I believe vice did a piece on it.</v>

4596
02:06:24.551 --> 02:06:25.530
<v Speaker 2>It was it a vice piece.</v>

4597
02:06:25.590 --> 02:06:26.730
<v Speaker 2>See if you find it vice,</v>

4598
02:06:26.731 --> 02:06:27.564
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty damn cool.</v>

4599
02:06:27.620 --> 02:06:27.900
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

4600
02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:29.400
<v Speaker 2>I think they did a piece on,</v>

4601
02:06:29.401 --> 02:06:31.280
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where I got all the,</v>

4602
02:06:31.281 --> 02:06:31.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4603
02:06:31.490 --> 02:06:32.820
<v Speaker 2>the original information from then.</v>

4604
02:06:32.821 --> 02:06:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I just kept looking into it.</v>

4605
02:06:34.020 --> 02:06:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4606
02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:38.340
<v Speaker 2>But Mitt Romney's dad like always wanted to be president but couldn't because he</v>

4607
02:06:38.341 --> 02:06:39.370
<v Speaker 2>wasn't born in America.</v>

4608
02:06:39.380 --> 02:06:40.110
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

4609
02:06:40.110 --> 02:06:40.831
<v Speaker 2>Like Ted Cruz,</v>

4610
02:06:40.831 --> 02:06:41.251
<v Speaker 2>Ted Cruz,</v>

4611
02:06:41.251 --> 02:06:41.791
<v Speaker 2>born in Canada.</v>

4612
02:06:41.791 --> 02:06:42.001
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>

4613
02:06:42.001 --> 02:06:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Fuck wait,</v>

4614
02:06:43.111 --> 02:06:44.190
<v Speaker 2>but he's running for president.</v>

4615
02:06:44.200 --> 02:06:48.000
<v Speaker 2>He's both American and Canadian citizen because his mother was American,</v>

4616
02:06:48.001 --> 02:06:48.990
<v Speaker 2>but he was born in Canada.</v>

4617
02:06:49.140 --> 02:06:50.280
<v Speaker 2>So like some sort of thing.</v>

4618
02:06:50.281 --> 02:06:51.960
<v Speaker 2>Were you born in a plane?</v>

4619
02:06:51.961 --> 02:06:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't be allowed to present anywhere in Mexican Mormon war.</v>

4620
02:06:56.701 --> 02:06:57.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4621
02:06:57.001 --> 02:06:57.480
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>

4622
02:06:57.480 --> 02:06:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Vice full length.</v>

4623
02:06:58.651 --> 02:06:59.790
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Dude.</v>

4624
02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:00.773
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

4625
02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:01.501
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4626
02:07:01.501 --> 02:07:03.830
<v Speaker 2>they're at war apparently with the uh,</v>

4627
02:07:03.930 --> 02:07:07.930
<v Speaker 2>drug cartels down there and they get kidnapped and all kinds of crazy five-part</v>

4628
02:07:07.950 --> 02:07:08.340
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

4629
02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Seven part things.</v>

4630
02:07:09.210 --> 02:07:09.900
<v Speaker 2>Jesus full.</v>

4631
02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:11.130
<v Speaker 2>You can watch the full length thing.</v>

4632
02:07:11.250 --> 02:07:12.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean the advice doc,</v>

4633
02:07:12.310 --> 02:07:15.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean the warring Mormons sounds like a great band name.</v>

4634
02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:18.480
<v Speaker 2>The warring Mormons are playing Coachella next year,</v>

4635
02:07:18.510 --> 02:07:19.650
<v Speaker 2>dorm in war.</v>

4636
02:07:26.670 --> 02:07:28.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like the Mormon Guar.</v>

4637
02:07:28.260 --> 02:07:28.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4638
02:07:28.381 --> 02:07:28.841
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>

4639
02:07:28.841 --> 02:07:29.790
<v Speaker 2>they were fine.</v>

4640
02:07:29.940 --> 02:07:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Everything was cool until the drug war came and when the drug war came,</v>

4641
02:07:33.631 --> 02:07:35.190
<v Speaker 2>I think they got,</v>

4642
02:07:35.380 --> 02:07:36.213
<v Speaker 2>they got fucked</v>

4643
02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:36.911
<v Speaker 5>because they're like,</v>

4644
02:07:36.911 --> 02:07:37.091
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4645
02:07:37.091 --> 02:07:41.110
<v Speaker 5>well now this place that we had sort of decided to live in this super dangerous</v>

4646
02:07:41.530 --> 02:07:42.251
<v Speaker 5>and then we got to go back.</v>

4647
02:07:42.251 --> 02:07:42.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4648
02:07:42.670 --> 02:07:43.121
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

4649
02:07:43.121 --> 02:07:43.450
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4650
02:07:43.450 --> 02:07:44.141
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what happened.</v>

4651
02:07:44.141 --> 02:07:49.120
<v Speaker 5>I know when when Mitt and his family decided to come back to good old US event,</v>

4652
02:07:49.420 --> 02:07:50.890
<v Speaker 5>having two wives sounds good.</v>

4653
02:07:51.150 --> 02:07:51.340
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4654
02:07:51.340 --> 02:07:52.810
<v Speaker 5>just have one on each side of the house.</v>

4655
02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:58.120
<v Speaker 5>One week you spend one with one hape or theory on any theory.</v>

4656
02:07:58.121 --> 02:08:00.850
<v Speaker 5>It's like communism in theory is awesome.</v>

4657
02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:01.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4658
02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:03.580
<v Speaker 5>Cause everyone just does their own thing.</v>

4659
02:08:03.581 --> 02:08:06.100
<v Speaker 5>And then all of the things are split amongst everyone and like,</v>

4660
02:08:06.101 --> 02:08:06.281
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

4661
02:08:06.281 --> 02:08:07.450
<v Speaker 5>you're a doctor and hey,</v>

4662
02:08:07.451 --> 02:08:09.220
<v Speaker 5>you're a mechanic but we're going to take care of everyone.</v>

4663
02:08:09.230 --> 02:08:09.301
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4664
02:08:09.301 --> 02:08:09.481
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

4665
02:08:09.481 --> 02:08:10.630
<v Speaker 5>but it sounds great.</v>

4666
02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:13.870
<v Speaker 5>And then you get human beings into it where it's like,</v>

4667
02:08:13.871 --> 02:08:14.320
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

4668
02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:17.170
<v Speaker 5>now the doctor who went to 12 years of med school has to be like,</v>

4669
02:08:17.171 --> 02:08:17.441
<v Speaker 5>well wait,</v>

4670
02:08:17.441 --> 02:08:18.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm being paid the same as the mechanic.</v>

4671
02:08:19.010 --> 02:08:19.843
<v Speaker 5>The fuck.</v>

4672
02:08:20.110 --> 02:08:20.801
<v Speaker 5>Well you know what?</v>

4673
02:08:20.801 --> 02:08:21.581
<v Speaker 5>Also to men,</v>

4674
02:08:21.581 --> 02:08:24.550
<v Speaker 5>like whenever someone has any control over people at all,</v>

4675
02:08:24.551 --> 02:08:26.410
<v Speaker 5>people don't like to be controlled at all.</v>

4676
02:08:26.770 --> 02:08:27.041
<v Speaker 5>And you,</v>

4677
02:08:27.041 --> 02:08:27.401
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4678
02:08:27.401 --> 02:08:31.630
<v Speaker 5>you get one grown adult that has any control over another grown adult and people</v>

4679
02:08:31.631 --> 02:08:36.250
<v Speaker 5>resist and it gets ugly telling people what they can can't do with their</v>

4680
02:08:36.340 --> 02:08:37.960
<v Speaker 5>existence on this planet.</v>

4681
02:08:38.060 --> 02:08:38.410
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

4682
02:08:38.410 --> 02:08:38.591
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

4683
02:08:38.591 --> 02:08:39.040
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4684
02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:39.811
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to hear that.</v>

4685
02:08:39.811 --> 02:08:40.210
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

4686
02:08:40.210 --> 02:08:40.720
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

4687
02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:42.490
<v Speaker 5>you will be a mechanic.</v>

4688
02:08:42.491 --> 02:08:43.540
<v Speaker 5>You will be a carpenter.</v>

4689
02:08:43.541 --> 02:08:44.410
<v Speaker 5>You will be a tailor.</v>

4690
02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:46.030
<v Speaker 5>That's why Cuba doesn't work.</v>

4691
02:08:46.670 --> 02:08:48.530
<v Speaker 5>Communism doesn't work that way.</v>

4692
02:08:48.660 --> 02:08:50.800
<v Speaker 5>Not like that style of dictator,</v>

4693
02:08:50.860 --> 02:08:51.491
<v Speaker 5>communism,</v>

4694
02:08:51.491 --> 02:08:55.420
<v Speaker 5>dictator driven communism where they did decide what you're going to do,</v>

4695
02:08:55.421 --> 02:08:56.890
<v Speaker 5>what your occupation is going to be,</v>

4696
02:08:56.891 --> 02:08:59.590
<v Speaker 5>how much you can make and socialism in general,</v>

4697
02:08:59.591 --> 02:09:01.360
<v Speaker 5>like the idea behind it is beautiful.</v>

4698
02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:02.590
<v Speaker 5>We all contribute.</v>

4699
02:09:02.660 --> 02:09:04.540
<v Speaker 5>We all become a part of this community.</v>

4700
02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:08.050
<v Speaker 5>Meaning in a way you're small family union.</v>

4701
02:09:08.110 --> 02:09:11.680
<v Speaker 5>You're a small family unit as a communistic state because you're all like</v>

4702
02:09:11.890 --> 02:09:15.290
<v Speaker 5>helping each other out and you're all doing your jobs and wife on Sheridan</v>

4703
02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:15.761
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

4704
02:09:15.761 --> 02:09:16.720
<v Speaker 5>That's very communist,</v>

4705
02:09:16.721 --> 02:09:17.050
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4706
02:09:17.050 --> 02:09:17.590
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

4707
02:09:17.590 --> 02:09:19.780
<v Speaker 5>Piling all your money together and sure and then,</v>

4708
02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:21.550
<v Speaker 5>but no one's telling the wife like,</v>

4709
02:09:21.551 --> 02:09:23.590
<v Speaker 5>you know some bitch you got to do this.</v>

4710
02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:25.993
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4711
02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:27.431
<v Speaker 5>this is his rule,</v>

4712
02:09:27.431 --> 02:09:28.540
<v Speaker 5>but I guess you are kind of,</v>

4713
02:09:28.690 --> 02:09:31.720
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if there's going to be any way that you can test for what you'd be best</v>

4714
02:09:31.721 --> 02:09:32.260
<v Speaker 5>at though.</v>

4715
02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:34.510
<v Speaker 5>Like the website 23 and me,</v>

4716
02:09:34.630 --> 02:09:38.230
<v Speaker 5>it goes through your DNA and it tells you like if you have the warrior gene,</v>

4717
02:09:38.231 --> 02:09:40.020
<v Speaker 5>if you have like all these certain genes,</v>

4718
02:09:40.090 --> 02:09:40.540
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4719
02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:41.800
<v Speaker 5>if your kids are going to be bald,</v>

4720
02:09:41.801 --> 02:09:43.780
<v Speaker 5>but I wonder if there's ever going to be a thing where they go,</v>

4721
02:09:43.781 --> 02:09:45.790
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be really good at math stuff.</v>

4722
02:09:45.790 --> 02:09:47.410
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be really good at it.</v>

4723
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:48.970
<v Speaker 5>But even if you are really good at it,</v>

4724
02:09:48.971 --> 02:09:51.430
<v Speaker 5>like say like if something comes along and says you're going to be really good</v>

4725
02:09:51.431 --> 02:09:54.790
<v Speaker 5>at math but you really want to be a musician,</v>

4726
02:09:55.140 --> 02:09:57.550
<v Speaker 5>like who the fuck is to tell you that you can't be a musician?</v>

4727
02:09:58.060 --> 02:09:58.960
<v Speaker 5>Dr Ken,</v>

4728
02:09:59.140 --> 02:09:59.970
<v Speaker 5>perfect example.</v>

4729
02:09:59.970 --> 02:10:00.751
<v Speaker 5>Dr Jiang.</v>

4730
02:10:00.751 --> 02:10:01.060
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4731
02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:02.520
<v Speaker 5>Ken Jong was a,</v>

4732
02:10:03.070 --> 02:10:03.910
<v Speaker 5>was a doctor.</v>

4733
02:10:04.390 --> 02:10:04.721
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4734
02:10:04.721 --> 02:10:08.710
<v Speaker 5>like really recently and go and it's apparently really good doctor and he's</v>

4735
02:10:08.711 --> 02:10:09.011
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4736
02:10:09.011 --> 02:10:09.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4737
02:10:09.490 --> 02:10:12.760
<v Speaker 5>I was doing this acting thing and doing comedy and I like that better.</v>

4738
02:10:12.761 --> 02:10:13.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm making a good living at it.</v>

4739
02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:14.793
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to do that instead.</v>

4740
02:10:14.890 --> 02:10:17.290
<v Speaker 5>And he's funny and he's great at that.</v>

4741
02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:21.070
<v Speaker 5>I just think there's a lot of people would like to do a lot of things like,</v>

4742
02:10:21.071 --> 02:10:23.800
<v Speaker 5>look what if someone told me that I could either be a cage fighting commentator</v>

4743
02:10:23.801 --> 02:10:24.610
<v Speaker 5>or a comedian,</v>

4744
02:10:24.610 --> 02:10:27.940
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't be bolt right or have a podcast.</v>

4745
02:10:28.690 --> 02:10:29.260
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

4746
02:10:29.260 --> 02:10:31.960
<v Speaker 5>Either you do a podcast or you know you do something else.</v>

4747
02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:32.410
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

4748
02:10:32.410 --> 02:10:32.951
<v Speaker 5>One or the other.</v>

4749
02:10:32.951 --> 02:10:33.300
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like,</v>

4750
02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

4751
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:36.530
<v Speaker 5>how come park and just do it all or you can like,</v>

4752
02:10:36.590 --> 02:10:38.600
<v Speaker 5>I got tired of fuck you want to do man,</v>

4753
02:10:38.810 --> 02:10:40.550
<v Speaker 5>that's the beautiful thing.</v>

4754
02:10:40.551 --> 02:10:44.330
<v Speaker 5>One of the most beautiful things about life is people deciding what they want to</v>

4755
02:10:44.331 --> 02:10:47.000
<v Speaker 5>focus their energy on and then you see the fruits of their labor.</v>

4756
02:10:47.330 --> 02:10:48.920
<v Speaker 5>Like someone who does murals,</v>

4757
02:10:49.130 --> 02:10:53.360
<v Speaker 5>like they can just decide I want to do really fucking cool murals or someone who</v>

4758
02:10:53.361 --> 02:10:55.130
<v Speaker 5>makes music or someone who writes books.</v>

4759
02:10:55.131 --> 02:10:59.030
<v Speaker 5>Like you could just decide and when you got someone telling you what you can and</v>

4760
02:10:59.031 --> 02:10:59.864
<v Speaker 5>can't do,</v>

4761
02:10:59.930 --> 02:11:02.030
<v Speaker 5>that just becomes all fucked up man.</v>

4762
02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:02.361
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4763
02:11:02.361 --> 02:11:02.781
<v Speaker 5>it's the,</v>

4764
02:11:02.781 --> 02:11:03.270
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4765
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:04.580
<v Speaker 5>it's the reverse psychology thing.</v>

4766
02:11:04.610 --> 02:11:05.080
<v Speaker 5>Where are you?</v>

4767
02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:05.751
<v Speaker 5>Where are you almost go?</v>

4768
02:11:05.751 --> 02:11:06.950
<v Speaker 5>Like you want to go against it,</v>

4769
02:11:06.951 --> 02:11:09.710
<v Speaker 5>like even if it makes sense just because you're like,</v>

4770
02:11:09.740 --> 02:11:10.070
<v Speaker 5>Eh,</v>

4771
02:11:10.070 --> 02:11:11.570
<v Speaker 5>I don't like you telling me to do that.</v>

4772
02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:12.111
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

4773
02:11:12.111 --> 02:11:12.944
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4774
02:11:13.130 --> 02:11:13.850
<v Speaker 5>People just,</v>

4775
02:11:13.850 --> 02:11:16.520
<v Speaker 5>it's not a natural aspect of,</v>

4776
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:18.380
<v Speaker 5>for some people it's natural.</v>

4777
02:11:19.170 --> 02:11:21.110
<v Speaker 5>Some people enjoy being told what to do.</v>

4778
02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:23.330
<v Speaker 5>Some people guidance in their life,</v>

4779
02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:23.810
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

4780
02:11:23.810 --> 02:11:24.643
<v Speaker 5>they like it.</v>

4781
02:11:24.710 --> 02:11:27.020
<v Speaker 5>And then there's also some people that like being ordered around,</v>

4782
02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:29.210
<v Speaker 5>there's like dominant and submissive people,</v>

4783
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:30.500
<v Speaker 5>his people that enjoy that.</v>

4784
02:11:30.501 --> 02:11:32.810
<v Speaker 5>And there's nothing wrong with that either makes you happy.</v>

4785
02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:33.201
<v Speaker 5>That's fine.</v>

4786
02:11:33.201 --> 02:11:34.310
<v Speaker 5>Freedom man.</v>

4787
02:11:34.311 --> 02:11:39.020
<v Speaker 5>Freedom to be submissive is just as much of a freedom is the freedom to be free.</v>

4788
02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:39.560
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4789
02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:41.150
<v Speaker 5>freedom to be an artist.</v>

4790
02:11:41.151 --> 02:11:42.350
<v Speaker 5>Freedom to be a doctor,</v>

4791
02:11:42.351 --> 02:11:45.890
<v Speaker 5>which fucking let people figure out what their thing is.</v>

02:11:46.130 --> 02:11:47.180
<v Speaker 5>He didn't from families,</v>

4793
02:11:47.181 --> 02:11:47.690
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

02:11:55.130 --> 02:12:00.130
<v Speaker 5>His family disowned his sister because his sister didn't marry a doctor.</v>

4800
02:12:01.900 --> 02:12:03.650
<v Speaker 5>He's the dad.</v>

4801
02:12:03.651 --> 02:12:08.420
<v Speaker 5>Put the girl through nursing school with the hopes that the girl would marry a</v>

4802
02:12:08.421 --> 02:12:09.790
<v Speaker 5>doctor now and she'll,</v>

4803
02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:11.850
<v Speaker 5>she can be a nurse just so she can marry.</v>

4804
02:12:11.890 --> 02:12:13.040
<v Speaker 5>So she's going to marry a doctor,</v>

<v Speaker 5>she fell in love with some regular dude.</v>

4808
02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:23.211
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

4809
02:12:23.211 --> 02:12:26.360
<v Speaker 5>the world is filled with stories like that for awhile.</v>

4810
02:12:26.530 --> 02:12:27.050
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

4811
02:12:27.050 --> 02:12:30.650
<v Speaker 5>my parents told me that I could only marry a dwarf because any tall woman would</v>

4812
02:12:30.651 --> 02:12:35.600
<v Speaker 5>only want me for either a sick fetish or for fame or for money or something like</v>

<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

4818
02:12:38.211 --> 02:12:39.500
<v Speaker 5>they've since changed their tune.</v>

4819
02:12:39.590 --> 02:12:40.423
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and but the thing is,</v>

4881
02:14:09.211 --> 02:14:14.211
<v Speaker 1>is that like my jokes are always going to have a little person perspective</v>

4882
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:19.560
<v Speaker 1>because I don't know how to write any other way.</v>

4883
02:14:19.590 --> 02:14:22.110
<v Speaker 1>They're not necessarily going to be dwarf jokes.</v>

4884
02:14:22.111 --> 02:14:22.381
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4885

4889
02:14:27.510 --> 02:14:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not going to be w w I always use this example that a guy told me to</v>

4890
02:14:32.701 --> 02:14:33.441
<v Speaker 1>say on stage.</v>

4891
02:14:33.441 --> 02:14:33.691
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4892
02:14:33.691 --> 02:14:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a joke for you.</v>

4893
02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:35.131
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4894
02:14:35.131 --> 02:14:35.521
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>

4895
02:14:35.521 --> 02:14:36.180
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

4896
02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:38.730
<v Speaker 1>you go on stage and say you can take a bath in a thimble.</v>

4897
02:14:38.731 --> 02:14:40.020
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be hilarious.</v>

4898
02:14:40.230 --> 02:14:40.950
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

4899
02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:41.580
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

4900
02:14:41.580 --> 02:14:42.370
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>

4901
02:14:42.370 --> 02:14:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh good.</v>

4902
02:14:44.210 --> 02:14:44.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4903
02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:45.500
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>

4904
02:14:45.500 --> 02:14:50.010
<v Speaker 1>that's like my example of like the chief of like the cheesy dwarf joke.</v>

4905
02:14:50.350 --> 02:14:51.183
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4906
02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:52.290
<v Speaker 1>but no matter what I do,</v>

4907
02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:53.550
<v Speaker 1>no matter what I experienced,</v>

4908
02:14:53.551 --> 02:14:56.430
<v Speaker 1>it's always going to be through that perspective simply because I don't know</v>

4909
02:14:56.431 --> 02:14:57.210
<v Speaker 1>what it's like.</v>

4910
02:14:57.210 --> 02:15:01.020
<v Speaker 1>If it's that different to experience things for through the,</v>

4911
02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:03.300
<v Speaker 1>through the eyes of a five foot eight guy.</v>

4912
02:15:03.330 --> 02:15:04.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4913
02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:05.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm not familiar with it.</v>

4914
02:15:05.970 --> 02:15:06.391
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4915
02:15:06.391 --> 02:15:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's different.</v>

4916
02:15:07.351 --> 02:15:08.460
<v Speaker 1>It might be exactly the same.</v>

4917
02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that you'll ever get to a point where it just doesn't even,</v>

4918
02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:12.050
<v Speaker 2>we get addressed,</v>

4919
02:15:12.050 --> 02:15:14.120
<v Speaker 2>like say if you become a famous comic and you're,</v>

4920
02:15:14.121 --> 02:15:14.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4921
02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:15.950
<v Speaker 2>20 years in and you're,</v>

4922
02:15:15.951 --> 02:15:16.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4923
02:15:16.231 --> 02:15:18.320
<v Speaker 2>doing specials on a regular basis,</v>

4924
02:15:18.321 --> 02:15:18.801
<v Speaker 2>like every two,</v>

4925
02:15:18.801 --> 02:15:19.341
<v Speaker 2>three years,</v>

4926
02:15:19.341 --> 02:15:20.300
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows who you are.</v>

4927
02:15:20.301 --> 02:15:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows what you do.</v>

4928
02:15:21.610 --> 02:15:22.040
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>

4929
02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:22.873
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>

4930
02:15:22.890 --> 02:15:24.910
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine because it,</v>

4931
02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:29.460
<v Speaker 1>because right now it's at a point where when I go on stage I have to talk about</v>

4932
02:15:29.461 --> 02:15:30.630
<v Speaker 1>it cause the entire audience is like,</v>

4933
02:15:30.631 --> 02:15:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Yo what's this?</v>

4934
02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:32.970
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

4935
02:15:32.970 --> 02:15:33.900
<v Speaker 1>what's up with this?</v>

4936
02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:34.560
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

4937
02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:37.050
<v Speaker 1>I got to know cause people aren't that familiar with little people.</v>

4938
02:15:37.130 --> 02:15:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4939
02:15:37.540 --> 02:15:41.340
<v Speaker 1>It's an experience that a lot of people aren't necessarily and the,</v>

4940
02:15:41.341 --> 02:15:45.360
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of nuances to it that some people just aren't quite aware of.</v>

4941
02:15:45.570 --> 02:15:46.111
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4942
02:15:46.111 --> 02:15:47.010
<v Speaker 1>and they have a lot of questions.</v>

4943
02:15:47.011 --> 02:15:49.260
<v Speaker 1>So I go on stage and I addressed those questions.</v>

4944
02:15:49.550 --> 02:15:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4945
02:15:50.130 --> 02:15:52.470
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want you to think that my entire act,</v>

4946
02:15:52.471 --> 02:15:53.610
<v Speaker 1>it's just like 12 joke.</v>

4947
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.830
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4948
02:15:54.830 --> 02:15:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Like I go into an out,</v>

4949
02:15:56.430 --> 02:15:56.800
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4950
02:15:56.800 --> 02:15:56.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4951
02:15:56.940 --> 02:15:57.840
<v Speaker 1>And there's only,</v>

4952
02:15:58.230 --> 02:15:59.340
<v Speaker 1>there's only so many things that,</v>

4953
02:15:59.580 --> 02:16:00.090
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

4954
02:16:00.090 --> 02:16:02.370
<v Speaker 1>that you can cover right now,</v>

4955
02:16:02.580 --> 02:16:03.091
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4956
02:16:03.091 --> 02:16:05.370
<v Speaker 1>in the new hour them try it that I'm trying to get together.</v>

4957
02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:07.560
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the jokes are just like,</v>

4958
02:16:07.561 --> 02:16:09.480
<v Speaker 1>this is what my life is like.</v>

4959
02:16:09.510 --> 02:16:13.110
<v Speaker 1>These are the stories that happened to me that are weird as fuck that you</v>

4960
02:16:13.111 --> 02:16:16.830
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't need that you're advertise person wouldn't even consider and you don't</v>

4961
02:16:16.831 --> 02:16:17.664
<v Speaker 1>think about.</v>

4962
02:16:17.700 --> 02:16:19.410
<v Speaker 1>And it's not necessarily like,</v>

4963
02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:19.740
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

4964
02:16:19.740 --> 02:16:20.820
<v Speaker 1>if I fall off a curb,</v>

4965
02:16:20.821 --> 02:16:21.481
<v Speaker 1>it's a long way,</v>

4966
02:16:21.481 --> 02:16:22.020
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4967
02:16:22.020 --> 02:16:22.291
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4968
02:16:22.291 --> 02:16:23.250
<v Speaker 1>it's not like that.</v>

4969
02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:28.380
<v Speaker 1>It's just like when a dude got like when I won't do the joke,</v>

4970
02:16:28.381 --> 02:16:29.590
<v Speaker 1>but like a guy,</v>

4971
02:16:29.591 --> 02:16:33.460
<v Speaker 1>I got into a car accident with a guy and he got out and when he saw me,</v>

4972
02:16:33.461 --> 02:16:35.740
<v Speaker 1>he didn't give a fuck about the car accident.</v>

4973
02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:36.460
<v Speaker 1>He was just like,</v>

4974
02:16:36.460 --> 02:16:37.280
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

4975
02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:38.020
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

4976
02:16:38.020 --> 02:16:38.950
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about this.</v>

4977
02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:41.840
<v Speaker 1>And he started asking me questions like about being a norm.</v>

4978
02:16:42.100 --> 02:16:44.400
<v Speaker 1>Was that a normal thing for you that happened?</v>

4979
02:16:44.420 --> 02:16:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4980
02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Like people have that uncomfortable.</v>

4981
02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:47.860
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know him?</v>

4982
02:16:47.950 --> 02:16:50.500
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he wasn't angry about the fact that I fucked up his car,</v>

4983
02:16:50.501 --> 02:16:50.801
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4984
02:16:50.801 --> 02:16:51.850
<v Speaker 1>whatever you hit him.</v>

4985
02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4986
02:16:52.060 --> 02:16:52.893
<v Speaker 1>it was totally my fault.</v>

4987
02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:54.270
<v Speaker 1>I was texting while driving like,</v>

4988
02:16:54.290 --> 02:16:55.690
<v Speaker 1>oh fucking idiot.</v>

4989

02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Like he didn't care.</v>

4995
02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:01.961
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4996
02:17:01.961 --> 02:17:02.321

02:17:03.131 --> 02:17:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Like you just start talking to me about being a little person.</v>

4999
02:17:05.021 --> 02:17:05.201
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

5000
02:17:05.201 --> 02:17:05.650
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

5001
02:17:05.650 --> 02:17:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Whatever distracts you wrote,</v>

5002
02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:07.833
<v Speaker 1>it's fine.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just showed up.</v>

5004
02:17:08.930 --> 02:17:09.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5005
02:17:09.331 --> 02:17:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Like bizarre phone books taped to your pedals and stuff like that.</v>

5006
02:17:13.731 --> 02:17:15.490
<v Speaker 1>I have a pedal extenders,</v>

5007
02:17:15.950 --> 02:17:17.020
<v Speaker 1>so it's kind of close.</v>

5008
02:17:17.021 --> 02:17:22.021
<v Speaker 1>So it's like metal rods that you put on at you attach and then you put that,</v>

5009
02:17:23.321 --> 02:17:24.400
<v Speaker 1>have a pedal on top of it.</v>

02:17:30.850 --> 02:17:33.360
<v Speaker 1>no legs heal nubs arms.</v>

5017
02:17:33.370 --> 02:17:34.420
<v Speaker 1>And he drove us around.</v>

5018
02:17:34.450 --> 02:17:37.310

02:17:42.400 --> 02:17:43.080
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5025
02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5028
02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:45.521
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

5029
02:17:45.521 --> 02:17:45.850
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

5030
02:17:45.850 --> 02:17:50.850
<v Speaker 1>he drives around with his elbows and he was like spinning the steering wheel and</v>

5031
02:17:51.290 --> 02:17:52.990
<v Speaker 1>says the is the mother of invention.</v>

5032
02:17:53.290 --> 02:17:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5033
02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:54.760
<v Speaker 1>There was a trip.</v>

5034
02:17:54.760 --> 02:17:55.790
<v Speaker 1>It was a really good dude.</v>

5035
02:17:55.791 --> 02:17:56.740
<v Speaker 1>And he was drunk,</v>

5036
02:17:56.741 --> 02:17:57.574
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

5037
02:17:58.530 --> 02:17:59.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he was drunk.</v>

5038
02:17:59.531 --> 02:18:01.470
<v Speaker 1>I didn't breathalyze them there.</v>

5039
02:18:01.730 --> 02:18:02.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll look at that.</v>

5040
02:18:02.490 --> 02:18:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5041
02:18:02.620 --> 02:18:03.341
<v Speaker 1>he's got the nubs.</v>

5042
02:18:03.341 --> 02:18:04.390
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about him.</v>

5043
02:18:04.391 --> 02:18:05.224
<v Speaker 1>That was</v>

5044
02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:08.710
<v Speaker 1>his defense.</v>

5045
02:18:09.130 --> 02:18:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5046
02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:10.630
<v Speaker 1>He just slips out of it.</v>

5047
02:18:10.660 --> 02:18:11.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5048
02:18:11.021 --> 02:18:11.501
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

5049
02:18:11.501 --> 02:18:12.940
<v Speaker 1>this guy drives around.</v>

5050
02:18:12.941 --> 02:18:14.350
<v Speaker 1>He drives us around in his van.</v>

5051
02:18:14.390 --> 02:18:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5052
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:18.850
<v Speaker 1>There's a part where it right after here where he actually shows up driving,</v>

5053
02:18:18.851 --> 02:18:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

5054
02:18:19.570 --> 02:18:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5055
02:18:20.380 --> 02:18:21.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5056
02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:22.900
<v Speaker 1>And then his other friend,</v>

5057
02:18:23.470 --> 02:18:24.670
<v Speaker 1>what was the weapon with his other friend?</v>

5058
02:18:24.910 --> 02:18:26.530
<v Speaker 1>His other friend was paralyzed.</v>

5059
02:18:26.531 --> 02:18:30.310
<v Speaker 1>He was in a wheelchair and he was heckling and he wouldn't stop heckling.</v>

5060
02:18:30.311 --> 02:18:33.580
<v Speaker 1>So I taught a girl who's in the front row with them how to choke them</v>

5061
02:18:33.581 --> 02:18:34.414
<v Speaker 1>unconscious.</v>

5062
02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:37.290
<v Speaker 1>So she choked the dude out calls.</v>

5063
02:18:37.310 --> 02:18:38.470

5081
02:19:04.451 --> 02:19:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I talked to his friends in the trophy room,</v>

5082
02:19:06.290 --> 02:19:11.290
<v Speaker 1>unconscious was with him and I said to her how she could get him to take a</v>

02:20:54.141 --> 02:20:56.000
<v Speaker 1>Cause like I've got my car,</v>

5124
02:20:56.001 --> 02:20:59.810
<v Speaker 1>I've got my seat at the perfect spot where I can see the mirror steering wheels.</v>

5125
02:20:59.811 --> 02:21:00.051
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

5126
02:21:00.051 --> 02:21:00.861

02:21:00.861 --> 02:21:01.400
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

5128
02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:03.290
<v Speaker 1>And then the valley gets it and they just fuck it up.</v>

5129
02:21:03.291 --> 02:21:03.740
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

5135
02:21:07.791 --> 02:21:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Like just do that.</v>

5136
02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Or there's certain cars you can use and certain cars you can't use,</v>

5137
02:21:12.201 --> 02:21:14.420
<v Speaker 1>like certain cars you can't adjust properly.</v>

5138
02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:15.740
<v Speaker 1>Like the car I have right now,</v>

5139
02:21:15.741 --> 02:21:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I've got a Lexus CT,</v>

5140
02:21:17.241 --> 02:21:18.830
<v Speaker 1>which is a little hatchback hybrid.</v>

5141
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:20.023
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

5142
02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:21.320
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to do too much to it.</v>

5143
02:21:21.321 --> 02:21:25.970
<v Speaker 1>I got Pedalec senators on that that were very small and then the seat moves up a</v>

5144
02:21:25.971 --> 02:21:26.181
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

5145
02:21:26.181 --> 02:21:28.820
<v Speaker 1>But also their steering wheel extends out.</v>

5146
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5147
02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:30.170
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

5148
02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:31.610
<v Speaker 1>my arms are good cause my arms are small.</v>

5149
02:21:31.611 --> 02:21:32.450
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

5150
02:21:32.451 --> 02:21:33.710
<v Speaker 1>yes I was able to grab the steering wheel.</v>

5151
02:21:33.711 --> 02:21:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I can drive that thing with not too much modification.</v>

5152
02:21:36.351 --> 02:21:40.280
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I had to do was I also had to pop the air bag because I'm really</v>

5153
02:21:40.281 --> 02:21:41.480
<v Speaker 1>close to the steering wheel.</v>

5154
02:21:41.690 --> 02:21:42.160
<v Speaker 1>So if that,</v>

5155
02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:44.060
<v Speaker 1>so if that airbag goes off,</v>

5156
02:21:44.440 --> 02:21:45.290
<v Speaker 1>it takes your head off.</v>

5157
02:21:45.291 --> 02:21:45.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5158
02:21:45.561 --> 02:21:46.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm gone.</v>

5159
02:21:46.310 --> 02:21:48.740
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen people's faces and they get hit with that airbag?</v>

5160
02:21:49.090 --> 02:21:53.300
<v Speaker 1>The airbag fucking looks like give you some black ice and it looks like they got</v>

5161
02:21:53.301 --> 02:21:54.380
<v Speaker 1>hit with a waffle iron.</v>

5162
02:21:54.381 --> 02:21:56.300
<v Speaker 1>They had like those lines on their face.</v>

5163
02:21:56.910 --> 02:21:58.100
<v Speaker 1>A good way to put it.</v>

5164
02:21:58.160 --> 02:21:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5165
02:21:58.750 --> 02:21:59.330

02:21:59.330 --> 02:22:00.830
<v Speaker 1>and I got to list to you,</v>

5181
02:22:18.651 --> 02:22:20.570
<v Speaker 1>and we could all agree on this.</v>

5182
02:22:20.900 --> 02:22:23.600
<v Speaker 1>When you're doing a show and someone is heckling you,</v>

5183
02:22:23.601 --> 02:22:24.830
<v Speaker 1>it's not just you,</v>

02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:26.611
<v Speaker 5>up for you.</v>

5186
02:22:26.611 --> 02:22:28.680
<v Speaker 5>They're fucking up for the whole room.</v>

5187
02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:31.170
<v Speaker 5>That's why everybody gets angry at them.</v>

5188
02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:33.330
<v Speaker 5>It's like people don't understand that.</v>

5189
02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:36.660
<v Speaker 5>Like there's this thing like you're trying to put on a show.</v>

5190
02:22:36.810 --> 02:22:36.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5191
02:22:36.970 --> 02:22:38.760
<v Speaker 5>When someone jumps in like that,</v>

5192
02:22:38.761 --> 02:22:41.650
<v Speaker 5>like that person needs to be stopped at all costs.</v>

5193
02:22:41.651 --> 02:22:41.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5194
02:22:41.980 --> 02:22:43.590
<v Speaker 5>I like when I get a heckler.</v>

5195
02:22:43.970 --> 02:22:45.180
<v Speaker 5>It's why I like,</v>

5196
02:22:45.300 --> 02:22:49.830
<v Speaker 5>some people say when a comic would go on stage and they get a heckler and then</v>

5197
02:22:49.831 --> 02:22:50.820
<v Speaker 5>they get like,</v>

5198
02:22:50.821 --> 02:22:50.971
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

5199
02:22:50.971 --> 02:22:55.971
<v Speaker 5>but this woman was heckling him and then he said that she should go get raped by</v>

5200
02:22:56.041 --> 02:22:56.940
<v Speaker 5>a thousand Dick's.</v>

5201
02:22:56.941 --> 02:23:00.300
<v Speaker 5>It's like he's not thinking or she's not thinking what's politically correct at</v>

5202
02:23:00.301 --> 02:23:00.840
<v Speaker 5>that moment.</v>

5203
02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:03.030
<v Speaker 5>You're only thought is shut the fuck up</v>

5204
02:23:04.540 --> 02:23:08.010
<v Speaker 5>as hilarious and also reflect the attitude of the room.</v>

5205
02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:08.520
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

5206
02:23:08.520 --> 02:23:09.091
<v Speaker 5>Because the room,</v>

5207
02:23:09.091 --> 02:23:10.380
<v Speaker 5>they're fucking angry.</v>

5208
02:23:11.110 --> 02:23:12.540
<v Speaker 5>They want to say something like that,</v>

5209
02:23:12.541 --> 02:23:13.250
<v Speaker 5>but they can't.</v>

5210
02:23:13.250 --> 02:23:13.670
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

5211
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:14.630
<v Speaker 5>So you're the voice of that.</v>

5212
02:23:14.631 --> 02:23:14.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5213
02:23:14.790 --> 02:23:17.070
<v Speaker 5>they're 1520 rows back and if you say,</v>

5214
02:23:17.071 --> 02:23:18.750
<v Speaker 5>I hope you get raped by a thousand decks,</v>

5215
02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:21.990
<v Speaker 5>they don't really think that.</v>

5216
02:23:22.430 --> 02:23:22.840
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

5217
02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:25.860
<v Speaker 5>but that's when you violate the agreement.</v>

5218
02:23:25.890 --> 02:23:27.970
<v Speaker 5>The agreement is I to come to a show.</v>

5219
02:23:28.530 --> 02:23:28.861
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

5220
02:23:28.861 --> 02:23:29.311
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

5221
02:23:29.311 --> 02:23:30.031
<v Speaker 5>That's the agreement.</v>

5222
02:23:30.031 --> 02:23:30.451
<v Speaker 5>You come,</v>

5223
02:23:30.451 --> 02:23:31.410
<v Speaker 5>you're an audience member.</v>

5224
02:23:31.411 --> 02:23:35.220
<v Speaker 5>You're not a part of the show and not interrupting bits that are planned out in</v>

5225
02:23:35.221 --> 02:23:35.980
<v Speaker 5>advance.</v>

5226
02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:38.760
<v Speaker 5>You're interrupting time and you're making it all about you.</v>

5227
02:23:38.761 --> 02:23:39.900
<v Speaker 5>You're a selfish fuck.</v>

5228
02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:41.820
<v Speaker 5>And I hate that excuse of well,</v>

5229
02:23:41.821 --> 02:23:44.380
<v Speaker 5>you should be a professional party at his job.</v>

5230
02:23:44.490 --> 02:23:45.323
<v Speaker 5>That is part of the job,</v>

5231
02:23:45.630 --> 02:23:46.980
<v Speaker 5>the job fuck up.</v>

5232
02:23:47.250 --> 02:23:48.530
<v Speaker 5>That is part of the jostle.</v>

5233
02:23:48.660 --> 02:23:52.320
<v Speaker 5>But the idea that you should be a professional meaning that like this is like</v>

5234
02:23:52.780 --> 02:23:55.900
<v Speaker 5>you should just deal with it and you shouldn't say anything mean yes,</v>

5235
02:23:56.010 --> 02:23:57.720
<v Speaker 5>but without saying anything controversial,</v>

5236
02:23:58.120 --> 02:24:00.360
<v Speaker 5>you don't even know what this job is.</v>

5237
02:24:00.780 --> 02:24:01.800
<v Speaker 5>You have no idea.</v>

5238
02:24:01.840 --> 02:24:04.710
<v Speaker 5>I think that just because they paid money to come see you,</v>

5239
02:24:04.711 --> 02:24:06.570
<v Speaker 5>they can sort of dictate how you do it.</v>

5240
02:24:06.750 --> 02:24:06.871
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

5241
02:24:06.871 --> 02:24:07.021
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

5242
02:24:07.021 --> 02:24:08.940
<v Speaker 5>it's the same way with the same way with the movies.</v>

5243
02:24:08.941 --> 02:24:10.590
<v Speaker 5>I paid money to see this x men movie.</v>

5244
02:24:10.620 --> 02:24:12.060
<v Speaker 5>It must be to my liking.</v>

5245
02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:14.730
<v Speaker 5>Cyclops is wearing the wrong outfit.</v>
