<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

12
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Fresh off a Christmas.</v>

13
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Everybody had a bit of the flu.</v>

14
00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:17.191
<v Speaker 1>Touch the flu.</v>

15
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Put me on my back for a couple hours every day.</v>

16
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Did you get that rally shirt?</v>

17
00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Did you get the flu shots?</v>

18
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

19
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.921
<v Speaker 1>Did Not.</v>

20
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I should.</v>

21
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.091
<v Speaker 1>Who gets the shot?</v>

22
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:24.924
<v Speaker 1>I don't get those.</v>

23
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.910
<v Speaker 1>I should lose up 70%.</v>

24
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

25
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

26
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.261
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

27
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Well apparently it's a very complicated thing to try to nail which flu virus is</v>

28
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:34.900
<v Speaker 1>going to hit people and they don't get it.</v>

29
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.671
<v Speaker 1>They don't get it.</v>

30
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

31
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

32
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

33
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>The CDC will sometimes be like,</v>

34
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:38.491
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

35
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>we just checked this flu's coming in.</v>

36
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a bitch.</v>

37
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>But here's the problem.</v>

38
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times I'll even admit when you get the flu shot,</v>

39
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't take,</v>

40
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

41
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.530
<v Speaker 1>it helps a little bit.</v>

42
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.901
<v Speaker 1>it will make the film.</v>

44
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>You get less,</v>

45
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.080
<v Speaker 1>you can get the flu.</v>

46
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.870
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're injecting the flu and the flu shot.</v>

47
00:00:55.871 --> 00:00:56.704
<v Speaker 1>It's like the sickest,</v>

48
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>it's the dengue virus,</v>

49
00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.881
<v Speaker 1>but it has,</v>

50
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:02.180
<v Speaker 1>there's a reaction that some people have to do it right?</v>

51
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

52
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:03.114
<v Speaker 1>You can never know.</v>

53
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.013
<v Speaker 1>You can have a,</v>

54
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>when you're sick,</v>

55
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>if you're about to get sick or you're feeling sick,</v>

56
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>don't get the flu shot.</v>

57
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:08.334
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>

58
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

59
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.460
<v Speaker 1>They say don't get it when your immune system's compromised,</v>

60
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes they can give you the flu shot and everybody will get the flu and</v>

61
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:15.690
<v Speaker 1>you won't.</v>

62
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>So it does work.</v>

63
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

64
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

65
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

66
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.313
<v Speaker 1>but I don't do it.</v>

67
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.921
<v Speaker 1>I need to.</v>

68
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:20.371
<v Speaker 1>I just don't,</v>

69
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:20.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

71
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>do I want to go in there and get a shot?</v>

72
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:22.891
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pussy.</v>

73
00:01:22.891 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

74
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

75
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.870
<v Speaker 1>I'll just get sick for 10 minutes.</v>

76
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to do it.</v>

77
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what,</v>

78
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.370
<v Speaker 1>if I'm Francis or if I'm steep,</v>

79
00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>am trying to give fucking Francis the flu.</v>

80
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.680

<v Speaker 1>They found that North Korean soldier that defected.</v>

86
00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>He had been vaccinated against anthrax.</v>

88
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.651
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:47.040

<v Speaker 1>He's the second guy that defected in a month.</v>

94
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.971
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.180
<v Speaker 1>in his thing and he was eating raw like everything.</v>

101
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.390
<v Speaker 1>They're starving to death over there.</v>

102
00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>And North Korea.</v>

103
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Well communism works especially,</v>

104
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:04.854
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't turn into,</v>

105
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a monarchy.</v>

106
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.331
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

107
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 1>communism was asked all you fucking freaks out there.</v>

108
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>All you young millennials were beads.</v>

109
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Just getting into Korea.</v>

110
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

111
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not your history,</v>

112
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:14.941
<v Speaker 1>a history major,</v>

113
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:17.750
<v Speaker 1>but I know enough about history to know about Marxism law.</v>

114
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Especially after talking to Jordan Peterson about her.</v>

115
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I dove deep and do it.</v>

116
00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:21.350
<v Speaker 1>It just great.</v>

117
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.691
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

118
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:21.970
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

119
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>What is the history of this stuff?</v>

120
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>It's all terrible.</v>

121
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Of course it doesn't work.</v>

122
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

123
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

124
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.010
<v Speaker 1>it's not human nature.</v>

125
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>You need,</v>

126
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>you need a central power.</v>

127
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>You need someone to keep the ones that are getting,</v>

128
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I talked to an academic the other day,</v>

129
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.371
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

130
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:35.881
<v Speaker 1>so what are you saying?</v>

131
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:36.780

132
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:37.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

133

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

134
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>and he's talking about the Scandinavian system of government and how great it</v>

135
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:41.911
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

136

<v Speaker 1>I go.</v>

137
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.060
<v Speaker 1>When was the last time you bought something made in Scandinavia?</v>

138
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I like Scandinavia,</v>

139
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>like sobs,</v>

140
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.570

141
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.590
<v Speaker 1>a good call.</v>

142
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.840
<v Speaker 1>There are certain things we're talking about an iPad right now are the ones that</v>

143
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>you know that everything was made in the marketplace.</v>

144
00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.693
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

145
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

146
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a smaller place too,</v>

147
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:02.141
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

148
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:02.491
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

149
00:03:02.491 --> 00:03:03.330
<v Speaker 2>you're not dealing with it.</v>

150
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 2>It's called [inaudible] and Sweden.</v>

151
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 2>What's the last good thing Russia made?</v>

152
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.103
<v Speaker 2>It's a good point.</v>

153
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.530
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

154
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 2>not the Kalashnikov.</v>

155
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

156
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.880
<v Speaker 2>the Kalashnikov and they made some good rifles and they made,</v>

157
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 2>so they had some good strides they made in rocketry.</v>

158
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.841
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

159
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 2>there were the first guy to put a guy into orbit,</v>

160
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.380
<v Speaker 2>although the absolutely did fake the video footage that they released of Eureka</v>

161
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Garr off.</v>

162
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Is that his name?</v>

163
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.153
<v Speaker 2>Yuri Gagarin.</v>

164
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Yuri Gagarin in space.</v>

165
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 2>They've proven that there's no way you could get the kind of camera that you</v>

166
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 2>would need to record that.</v>

167
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Which film in that small capsule that he was floating around in space and,</v>

168
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 2>and then there's light coming from two dogs.</v>

169
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 2>So they have like lights on these dump Fox.</v>

170
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.001
<v Speaker 2>They have lights on him,</v>

171
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 2>he's going to cabin and he's faking that.</v>

172
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.560
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

173
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 2>I think he really did do it,</v>

174
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't really get footage of him doing so.</v>

175
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 2>They fixed the footage,</v>

176
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 2>get that footage that the Russians have bumping into because Russia has just</v>

177
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:55.001
<v Speaker 2>propaganda.</v>

178
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:55.834
<v Speaker 2>They all did it.</v>

179
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 2>The Russians are amazing at anything.</v>

180
00:03:57.581 --> 00:03:58.680
<v Speaker 2>They put their mind to like that.</v>

181
00:03:58.681 --> 00:03:59.710
<v Speaker 2>The culture itself,</v>

182
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 2>they work so hard.</v>

183
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Like when if you look at them,</v>

184
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:02.321
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

185
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 2>we want to be great.</v>

186
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Powerlifters great,</v>

187
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.081
<v Speaker 2>great wrestlers.</v>

188
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:08.640
<v Speaker 2>Anything that [inaudible] doing steroids even that really?</v>

189
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.430
<v Speaker 2>Did you watch that movie?</v>

190
00:04:10.431 --> 00:04:11.780
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Fogel Movie Chris?</v>

191
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:12.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

192
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.050
<v Speaker 2>How fucking crazy so that everybody doing everybody,</v>

193
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.640
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>

194
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.880
<v Speaker 2>everybody banned.</v>

195
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.081
<v Speaker 2>They banned them.</v>

196
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 2>But here's what's really squirrely band.</v>

197
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 2>One of the things they did,</v>

198
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 2>they took a metals away from a couple of people,</v>

199
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.891
<v Speaker 2>but the people,</v>

200
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 2>they take metals away,</v>

201
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.031
<v Speaker 2>like they say,</v>

202
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 2>you can't compete in this sport and now they've pulled them out of a couple</v>

203
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 2>sports that nobody gives a fuck about.</v>

204
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 2>And here's the other problem,</v>

205
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 2>the IOC and Wada,</v>

206
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 2>the world antidoping agency,</v>

207
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 2>they're completely interconnected.</v>

208
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 2>People work for both of them.</v>

209
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 2>They go back and forth in between each other.</v>

210
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 2>They have an incestuous relationship and that was all exposed by Bryan Fogel in</v>

211
00:04:47.711 --> 00:04:48.191
<v Speaker 2>that movie.</v>

212
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking great movie and Chris,</v>

213
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:51.161
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't seen it,</v>

214
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:53.320
<v Speaker 2>you want to know like the depths of doping.</v>

215
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.161
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>

216
00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 2>I love that Russia Russian guy was fascinating to me and he,</v>

217
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.970
<v Speaker 2>he had been an athlete and then he's in a witness protection program,</v>

218
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:01.121
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

219
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's basically afraid for his life.</v>

220
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.603
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

221
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Russia is banned from the 2018 Olympics and the athletes are told to compete</v>

222
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 2>under the Olympic flag.</v>

223
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 2>You're not representing a company,</v>

224
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.310
<v Speaker 2>so a country rather.</v>

225
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:14.140
<v Speaker 2>So now the Olympics are a country.</v>

226
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.841
<v Speaker 2>Olympics.</v>

227
00:05:14.841 --> 00:05:15.551
<v Speaker 2>Got to get their own country.</v>

228
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:17.900
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be the new America elliptical there.</v>

229
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.690
<v Speaker 2>The concert dad state,</v>

230
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 2>most of these states,</v>

231
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 2>it's state sponsored and the antibiotics were coming out of China I think,</v>

232
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 2>and not all over crazy.</v>

233
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:29.310
<v Speaker 2>If you think rushes is the only one crazy,</v>

234
00:05:29.311 --> 00:05:30.144
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy.</v>

235
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 2>China did the same thing.</v>

236
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 2>Bryan Fogel pointed out the China did the exact same thing in Beijing.</v>

237
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 2>They want all these fucking gold metals like crazy.</v>

238
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 2>They were winning gold medals and when there's a disproportionate amount of gold</v>

239
00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 2>medals that are being one in your home country.</v>

240
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

241
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.453
<v Speaker 2>got an old car.</v>

242
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

243
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:45.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm skeptical.</v>

244
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.671
<v Speaker 2>Hip Off.</v>

245
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:45.890
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

246
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:46.080
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

247
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

248
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.921
<v Speaker 2>why am I a little,</v>

249
00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:47.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

250
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.430
<v Speaker 2>why am I a little concerned here that the financial gains of making that many</v>

251
00:05:51.431 --> 00:05:54.880
<v Speaker 2>Olympic gold medals are so fucking irresistible,</v>

252
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:55.181
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

253
00:05:55.181 --> 00:05:56.650
<v Speaker 2>look what it did for Jamaica.</v>

254
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

255
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>You don't make</v>

256
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 1>it on how the fast burners in the world,</v>

257
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.123
<v Speaker 1>Brandon,</v>

258
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>they're not known for that kind of,</v>

259
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:04.830
<v Speaker 1>that kind of national or</v>

260
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.770
<v Speaker 1>international sports now.</v>

261
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.111
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

262
00:06:08.111 --> 00:06:13.111
<v Speaker 1>But there's no denying that there is an extreme and rampant abuse of performance</v>

263
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:14.924
<v Speaker 1>nursing drive,</v>

264

278
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate snitch of snitches,</v>

279
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.460

<v Speaker 1>all snitch.</v>

282
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.020
<v Speaker 1>It's the guy who was the head of Balco who made that clear shit.</v>

283
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 1>It was undetectable for a little while until they figured out how to detect it,</v>

284
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.303
<v Speaker 1>which is what they always do.</v>

285
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 1>He said all the track and field's dirty.</v>

286
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

287
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

289
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.440
<v Speaker 1>So if you get some dudes coming out of Jamaica or France or Spain or whatever,</v>

290
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 1>and they just burst onto the scene,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They're doing some shit that no one knows about it.</v>

294
00:06:56.841 --> 00:06:59.150
<v Speaker 1>I know a woman is going to compete for our country.</v>

295
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.470
<v Speaker 1>How bigs or did it happen that she had it?</v>

296
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.343
<v Speaker 1>She had a dick on it,</v>

297
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.780
<v Speaker 1>but the steroids didn't him.</v>

298
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.480
<v Speaker 1>But she was at trend to be a triathlete and she was quite,</v>

299
00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:09.081
<v Speaker 1>she was American,</v>

300
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:11.010
<v Speaker 1>but she was going to represent the country of her art.</v>

301
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.080
<v Speaker 1>And I started training and she was phenomenal athlete and everything else.</v>

302
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 1>And her coach said,</v>

303
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:17.114
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

304
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

305
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 1>now of course we got to talk about getting to the next level.</v>

306
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

307
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.190
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

308
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.001
<v Speaker 1>I'm a triathlete,</v>

309
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:23.460
<v Speaker 1>which I wanted.</v>

310
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.070
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

311
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.600
<v Speaker 1>we gotta,</v>

312
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 1>we gotta start talking about messing with your endocrine system because you're</v>

313
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:27.920
<v Speaker 1>not gonna,</v>

314
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna get these times until we,</v>

315
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:30.621
<v Speaker 1>it came,</v>

316
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:31.454
<v Speaker 1>we compete.</v>

317
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.130
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>

318
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:32.480
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>

319
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.180
<v Speaker 1>and then when she saw that everybody,</v>

320
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

321
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:34.911
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

322
00:07:34.911 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 1>none of them,</v>

323
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.101
<v Speaker 1>he's famous coach.</v>

324
00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:37.150
<v Speaker 1>He's like this,</v>

325
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.720
<v Speaker 1>this is just a reality.</v>

326
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.681
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

327
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:39.861
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

328
00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:40.730
<v Speaker 1>that's what she's doing.</v>

329
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:41.923
<v Speaker 1>She didn't do it.</v>

330
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.580
<v Speaker 1>I would the Lance Armstrong story,</v>

331
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:48.710
<v Speaker 1>like Lance Armstrong realized when he was young that everybody is doing drugs,</v>

332
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:49.940
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>

333
00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 1>And so he who competed clean when he was young until he got to a certain level</v>

334
00:07:54.321 --> 00:07:54.681
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

335
00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:55.460
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

336
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.320
<v Speaker 1>like this is just how this goddamn thing works.</v>

337
00:07:57.321 --> 00:07:58.154
<v Speaker 1>It's just this week,</v>

338
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.850
<v Speaker 1>three card Monte game of hiding your dirty piss.</v>

339
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.390
<v Speaker 1>And he was better than everybody has that a bad guy state sponsored?</v>

340
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

341
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:06.620
<v Speaker 1>It's just part of the game.</v>

342
00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:06.840
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

343
00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:07.673
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>

344
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:08.031
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

345
00:08:08.031 --> 00:08:08.221
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

346
00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:09.800
<v Speaker 1>so my feeling is,</v>

347
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:10.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

348
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:11.211
<v Speaker 1>like so,</v>

349
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 1>so if weightlifters are gonna move world record weights,</v>

350
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 1>it's really exciting to see them do that.</v>

351
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 1>And obviously it power lifters and stuff like that are,</v>

352
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 1>are not going to be lifting as much with testosterone.</v>

353
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.170
<v Speaker 1>My question is,</v>

354
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.440
<v Speaker 1>are we ever going to be beat like the inexorable advance of technology.</v>

355
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Are we ever going to really be able to start as we are able to gene dope and all</v>

356
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:33.801
<v Speaker 1>that stuff.</v>

357
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Like where are we going with this and and is always going can be a cat and</v>

358
00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:37.350
<v Speaker 1>mouse.</v>

359
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Can we gonna yeah.</v>

360
00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Are we going to police this?</v>

361
00:08:39.191 --> 00:08:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Know everyone's always going to look for an edge always.</v>

362
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:42.260
<v Speaker 1>But in powerlifting,</v>

363
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:42.651
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

364
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:45.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck what they do cause the power lifting,</v>

365
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.310
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

366
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.690
<v Speaker 1>So when it comes to fighting,</v>

367
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:48.511
<v Speaker 1>fighting football,</v>

368
00:08:48.511 --> 00:08:49.130
<v Speaker 1>number one.</v>

369
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

370
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:50.144
<v Speaker 1>those are the two.</v>

371
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.030
<v Speaker 1>Number one fuck f for sure.</v>

372
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Football and fighting because you're hitting on is too.</v>

373
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:55.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

374
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Football's a combat sport.</v>

375
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 2>It's just got rigid rules when you're running full clip at each other and</v>

376
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:04.710
<v Speaker 2>literally like knocking each other unconscious cause your head butting each</v>

377
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:04.891
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

378
00:09:04.891 --> 00:09:05.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

379
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean which is baseball.</v>

380
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:06.230
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

381
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 2>a big part of football was until they stop people doing that.</v>

382
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:09.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

383
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a combat sport.</v>

384
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 2>100% it just doesn't have kicks or punches.</v>

385
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 2>But the juice is worth the squeeze and football.</v>

386
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.680
<v Speaker 2>It's worth the squeeze financially,</v>

387
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.121
<v Speaker 2>financially,</v>

388
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:18.931
<v Speaker 2>educationally.</v>

389
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 2>There's the same.</v>

390
00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:20.430
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

391
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.310
<v Speaker 2>how about baseball where your bat speed stays the same?</v>

392
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.490
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

393
00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:25.281
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck.</v>

394
00:09:25.281 --> 00:09:26.880
<v Speaker 2>Hit all the home runs you want baseball.</v>

395
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.170
<v Speaker 2>Baseball is,</v>

396
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:31.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a good argument for steroids because it's a boring fucking game too.</v>

397
00:09:31.311 --> 00:09:31.831
<v Speaker 2>And then you're awesome.</v>

398
00:09:31.831 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 2>It's fun was when someone hits that ball.</v>

399
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.141
<v Speaker 2>When was it fun?</v>

400
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:34.921
<v Speaker 2>When Jose can say,</v>

401
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:39.450
<v Speaker 2>come on Barry Bonds and mark McGwire that cracking them out of the park.</v>

402
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:40.350
<v Speaker 2>That's when it's fun.</v>

403
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.060
<v Speaker 2>And I don't like that.</v>

404
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 2>You get there,</v>

405
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.760
<v Speaker 2>you're playing 160 games and you break down to the season.</v>

406
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Peeps.</v>

407
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.300
<v Speaker 2>You too many gay Siri.</v>

408
00:09:47.301 --> 00:09:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Too many games.</v>

409
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:48.960
<v Speaker 2>Simply too many games.</v>

410
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

411
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.020
<v Speaker 2>If you're sprinting full out all the time like that,</v>

412
00:09:52.021 --> 00:09:53.070
<v Speaker 2>trying to get to third base.</v>

413
00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

414
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:56.730
<v Speaker 2>There's so many times where you're doing damage to your body and you're not</v>

415
00:09:56.731 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 2>going to have a chance to recover.</v>

416
00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

417
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.280
<v Speaker 2>But if you're on the Jews who couldn't run faster,</v>

418
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.270
<v Speaker 2>you can keep go.</v>

419
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:03.990
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think?</v>

420
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.450
<v Speaker 2>But it's weird with the MLB how they cracked down on it,</v>

421
00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

422
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.980
<v Speaker 2>They're killing it now,</v>

423
00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:09.060
<v Speaker 2>but the same with UFC,</v>

424
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:10.200
<v Speaker 2>like they cracked down on it,</v>

425
00:10:10.201 --> 00:10:13.920
<v Speaker 2>so now you have Usada but then you're not getting as good as the product that I</v>

426
00:10:13.921 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 2>don't think there's anything wrong with the product right there on the UFC.</v>

427
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.430
<v Speaker 2>I think it's as good as it's ever been.</v>

428
00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:18.420
<v Speaker 2>But how dare you?</v>

429
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:21.570
<v Speaker 2>I did a few fighters have dropped off the map,</v>

430
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.110
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's probably a good thing because I think those guys are probably</v>

431
00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:25.770
<v Speaker 2>agregious.</v>

432
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:26.191
<v Speaker 2>I'd see.</v>

433
00:10:26.191 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a combination.</v>

434
00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:29.610
<v Speaker 2>I think the skill level's going up just naturally,</v>

435
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

436
00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:31.560
<v Speaker 2>through evolution skill is going up,</v>

437
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.390
<v Speaker 2>but when you have such strict testing,</v>

438
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.990
<v Speaker 2>then we're missing out on certain guys like John Jones and these other guys.</v>

439
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:37.171
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

440
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Speaker 2>the John John's wants is very unfortunate because John is just</v>

441
00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.250
<v Speaker 2>just one of the most talented guys of all time,</v>

442
00:10:44.251 --> 00:10:45.390
<v Speaker 2>if not the most talented.</v>

443
00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:49.980
<v Speaker 2>He's number one and also the biggest disaster in terms of the big mistakes that</v>

444
00:10:49.981 --> 00:10:50.341
<v Speaker 2>he's made.</v>

445
00:10:50.341 --> 00:10:50.491
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

446
00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:50.631
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

447
00:10:50.631 --> 00:10:54.060
<v Speaker 2>we've never had a fighter that did a hit and run on a pregnant woman and broke</v>

448
00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:58.830
<v Speaker 2>her arm and then took off and then test positive for drugs because he's on Dick</v>

449
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Pills and then test positive again after his comeback after a spectacular went</v>

450
00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:03.840
<v Speaker 2>over Daniel Cormier.</v>

451
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.850
<v Speaker 2>And he's so disappointed in that regard.</v>

452
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.370
<v Speaker 2>So exceptional in his physical abilities,</v>

453
00:11:08.371 --> 00:11:08.940
<v Speaker 2>but the dis,</v>

454
00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.120
<v Speaker 2>the choices he makes and the decisions that come out of those choices.</v>

455
00:11:13.121 --> 00:11:14.340
<v Speaker 2>So just fucking terrible.</v>

456
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.260
<v Speaker 2>But a lot of it's because of the strict testing that the UFC hired you guys</v>

457
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.650
<v Speaker 2>decide to do with the car accident.</v>

458
00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:21.300
<v Speaker 2>That has nothing to do with the car accident,</v>

459
00:11:21.301 --> 00:11:23.520
<v Speaker 2>but so like Klaxon yes,</v>

460
00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:24.030
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

461
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.750
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

462
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:25.141
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

463
00:11:25.141 --> 00:11:25.471
<v Speaker 2>he'd be,</v>

464
00:11:25.471 --> 00:11:26.271
<v Speaker 2>he'd be cleared,</v>

465
00:11:26.271 --> 00:11:26.970
<v Speaker 2>he'd be all good.</v>

466
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:27.301
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

467
00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:27.720
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

468
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.540
<v Speaker 2>there's a symptom is a symptom of something else going on.</v>

469
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

470
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.660
<v Speaker 2>and people don't like to discuss this,</v>

471
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.430
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that easily could be is that John has impulse control</v>

472
00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:43.431
<v Speaker 2>because he's been sparring and fighting and at the highest level of the sport</v>

473
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.341
<v Speaker 2>for many,</v>

474
00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:45.270
<v Speaker 2>many years now.</v>

475
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.030
<v Speaker 2>And he's gotten hit in the head of gang of times.</v>

476
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:48.510
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

477
00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.321
<v Speaker 2>there's no way around it.</v>

478
00:11:49.321 --> 00:11:53.130
<v Speaker 2>There was just an article I posted on Twitter that came out a couple of days ago</v>

479
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.490
<v Speaker 2>that these neuroscientists</v>

480
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.380
<v Speaker 1>we're examining um,</v>

481
00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:01.470
<v Speaker 1>brain injury and violent behavior and like how they're connected and how damaged</v>

482
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:05.950
<v Speaker 1>to certain areas of the brain has irreparable consequences on the decision</v>

483
00:12:05.951 --> 00:12:06.530
<v Speaker 1>making ability.</v>

484
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 1>The person who gets hit,</v>

485
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:08.220
<v Speaker 1>I think that's part of it,</v>

486
00:12:08.221 --> 00:12:08.630
<v Speaker 1>but also,</v>

487
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

488
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:11.050
<v Speaker 1>he's been wild since high wild college,</v>

489
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:11.780
<v Speaker 1>which is the why.</v>

490
00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:12.311
<v Speaker 1>So dude,</v>

491
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 1>that's why he's a fucking,</v>

492
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.830
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why you is because he's a wild motherfucker and I loved that</v>

493
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:18.100
<v Speaker 1>part.</v>

494
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.180
<v Speaker 1>Connor's a little while too.</v>

495
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.033
<v Speaker 1>He's wild,</v>

496
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:22.570
<v Speaker 1>wild like you lit call masterminds of this game.</v>

497
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.150
<v Speaker 1>They're all little wild man to be 80 sport though.</v>

498
00:12:26.151 --> 00:12:26.391
<v Speaker 1>Look at,</v>

499
00:12:26.391 --> 00:12:30.000
<v Speaker 1>look at Cam Newton prior looking at some of the greatest fighters.</v>

500
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:30.910
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.960
<v Speaker 1>we won't need steroids.</v>

506
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Go and goes.</v>

507
00:12:43.061 --> 00:12:44.290
<v Speaker 1>You're having a champion of the world.</v>

508

509
00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:47.831
<v Speaker 1>Part of that.</v>

510
00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he doesn't want the devil's Dandruff.</v>

511
00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Speaker 1>See all fuck steep aimia the sitch he's gotta get,</v>

<v Speaker 1>ground and riding them.</v>

514
00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.390
<v Speaker 1>So you guys be careful cause I'm saying Steve Bay is gonna wrestle him to the</v>

515
00:13:01.391 --> 00:13:01.830
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

516
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I love hiring sincere.</v>

517
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Brian Count comes out brand council.</v>

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:09.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the tire him out and then he's going to stand them up in the</v>

519
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:10.211
<v Speaker 1>third,</v>

520
00:13:10.211 --> 00:13:12.430
<v Speaker 1>fourth round and all that stress is going to go away.</v>

521
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Well it's entirely possible as Steve Bay winds,</v>

522
00:13:14.531 --> 00:13:16.350
<v Speaker 1>this Dbas the world heavyweight champions,</v>

523
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.550
<v Speaker 1>tpa beaten junior dos Santos by knockout.</v>

524
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.870
<v Speaker 1>He beat a Orlowski by knockout.</v>

525
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 1>He beat Overeem by knocking that.</v>

526
00:13:22.421 --> 00:13:23.080
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

527
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.640
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

528
00:13:24.641 --> 00:13:27.160
<v Speaker 1>He won the title with a one punch falling away.</v>

529
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Right hand on the button.</v>

530
00:13:28.451 --> 00:13:29.530
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

531
00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:30.410
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about it.</v>

532
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.050
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>

533
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:37.140
<v Speaker 1>there's physical undeniable characteristics that in Ghana who possesses that</v>

534
00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:39.730
<v Speaker 1>make him the most terrifying guy in the sport.</v>

535
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:40.570
<v Speaker 1>But we haven't.</v>

536
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:41.260
<v Speaker 1>The only,</v>

537
00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.620
<v Speaker 1>the only shot that them seeing what Steve Bay when this fight though is</v>

538
00:13:44.621 --> 00:13:48.040
<v Speaker 1>stylistically he could be the Achilles heel to Francis.</v>

539
00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Meaning he doesn't entertain the standup.</v>

540
00:13:50.171 --> 00:13:53.560
<v Speaker 1>He just puts that fucking forehead in the middle of his chest as I,</v>

541
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:53.891
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

542
00:13:53.891 --> 00:13:55.360
<v Speaker 1>we're riding this out till the third,</v>

543
00:13:55.361 --> 00:13:55.811
<v Speaker 1>fourth round.</v>

544
00:13:55.811 --> 00:13:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what you can do here.</v>

545
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:58.210
<v Speaker 1>It's totally possible.</v>

546
00:13:58.211 --> 00:13:59.920
<v Speaker 1>But Alster when he clinched up with them,</v>

547
00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Allister is fucking huge and to clenched up with within Ghana and it was like</v>

548
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.380
<v Speaker 1>trying to bear hug a wall.</v>

549
00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.243
<v Speaker 1>You see his face,</v>

550
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.160
<v Speaker 1>he liked red state and then when he gets flipped around and he's like,</v>

551
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

552
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.520
<v Speaker 1>that's not snowflake.</v>

553
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:12.603
<v Speaker 1>That's not snowflake.</v>

554
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.660
<v Speaker 1>And then just get the ceiling on the co five four rounds,</v>

555
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.733
<v Speaker 1>three rounds.</v>

556
00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:18.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

557
00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:18.790
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

558
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.300
<v Speaker 1>I think the most he's ever been as to,</v>

559
00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:23.620
<v Speaker 1>he got taken out in his first fight against the Curtis blades.</v>

560
00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:27.760
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't hang your head on that because Curtis blades with a Juco,</v>

561
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:28.900
<v Speaker 1>national champion Juco,</v>

562
00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:29.770
<v Speaker 1>national chancellor.</v>

563
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Fucking good recipe.</v>

564
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.760
<v Speaker 1>But she's an excellent athlete too and he keeps getting better and better.</v>

565
00:14:33.761 --> 00:14:34.421
<v Speaker 1>Curtis Blades,</v>

566
00:14:34.421 --> 00:14:35.680
<v Speaker 1>a real dark horse in the sport.</v>

567
00:14:35.681 --> 00:14:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I really think that 10 now,</v>

568
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.550
<v Speaker 1>if he keeps improving and keeps working at the radius,</v>

569
00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:40.600
<v Speaker 1>he's a big guy.</v>

570
00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:41.530
<v Speaker 1>He hits hard,</v>

571
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.040
<v Speaker 1>fucking aggressive and smart standups has got,</v>

572
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.660
<v Speaker 1>hopefully it's working with Christian Alan out there and tell her I'll,</v>

573
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.910
<v Speaker 1>his standup's kind of is.</v>

574
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.370
<v Speaker 1>It's US getting better at getting better.</v>

575
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:51.410
<v Speaker 1>He's getting at it.</v>

576
00:14:51.411 --> 00:14:53.600
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is he's got a lot to work with.</v>

577
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>

578
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

579
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.340
<v Speaker 1>he's got a lot to work with and he's a young guy.</v>

580
00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.930

<v Speaker 1>Curtis blades has a,</v>

600

618
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.300
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't appraise anymore.</v>

619
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Now he's got fired.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I saw him in the first few weeks he had been through since I retired.</v>

625
00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:09.860
<v Speaker 1>I went to that UFC that we at in Vegas and there I was around the fighters and</v>

626
00:16:09.861 --> 00:16:11.440
<v Speaker 1>all that and there was one hot dog left,</v>

627
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.880
<v Speaker 1>went to grab the hot dog and he reached for the hot dog.</v>

628
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.870
<v Speaker 1>He fucking deboned me on a hot day.</v>

845
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.300

846
00:21:19.301 --> 00:21:20.230
<v Speaker 2>was it a spike thing?</v>

847
00:21:20.231 --> 00:21:21.130

851
00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:24.970
<v Speaker 2>And she,</v>

852
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:26.140
<v Speaker 2>but she had long hair back then.</v>

853
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean she was stunning,</v>

854
00:21:28.211 --> 00:21:30.820
<v Speaker 2>like astonishing looking and I didn't know she was at the time.</v>

855
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:31.870
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

856
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:32.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

857
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.741
<v Speaker 2>so she,</v>

858
00:21:32.741 --> 00:21:32.951
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

859
00:21:32.951 --> 00:21:33.490
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

860
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.060
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

861
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.940
<v Speaker 2>if she walked into a bar back then like that even now,</v>

862
00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:38.470
<v Speaker 2>but I mean back then you would have been like,</v>

863
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:38.741
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

864
00:21:38.741 --> 00:21:41.140
<v Speaker 2>she turns out as a supermodel failure.</v>

865
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.051
<v Speaker 2>She really doesn't,</v>

866
00:21:42.051 --> 00:21:42.410
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't,</v>

867
00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.580
<v Speaker 2>she's a model and she doesn't put any emphasis on that at all.</v>

868
00:21:45.581 --> 00:21:49.110
<v Speaker 2>All of our emphasis is on our fighting and zero trash-talking.</v>

869
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.520
<v Speaker 2>When she shaved her head,</v>

870
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.393
<v Speaker 2>the fight,</v>

871
00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:53.590
<v Speaker 2>she stated her head when she was fighting Paige vanzant.</v>

872
00:21:53.591 --> 00:21:54.040
<v Speaker 2>She went,</v>

873
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:54.251

877
00:21:58.031 --> 00:21:58.864
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

878
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Then beat the brakes off of.</v>

879
00:21:59.790 --> 00:21:59.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

880
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:00.850
<v Speaker 2>that's what she needs to look like.</v>

881
00:22:00.851 --> 00:22:01.271
<v Speaker 2>She's tough.</v>

882
00:22:01.271 --> 00:22:02.800
<v Speaker 2>Like that's like workout here.</v>

883
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.600
<v Speaker 2>She looks better with her head.</v>

884
00:22:04.601 --> 00:22:05.800
<v Speaker 2>Shaved I</v>

885
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:09.550
<v Speaker 2>corner with the right red shirt on there.</v>

886
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Jamie upper right hand corner right there.</v>

887
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean shut the fuck up.</v>

888
00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.290
<v Speaker 2>That's a beautiful girl.</v>

889
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:19.710
<v Speaker 2>That's a model that is about as hot is a woman's face gets w contract for God's</v>

890
00:22:21.061 --> 00:22:21.280
<v Speaker 2>sake.</v>

891
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

892
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.210
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck did no one see her coming hot mean it's,</v>

893
00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.700
<v Speaker 2>it's kinda crazy how because she was so feminine.</v>

894
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.140
<v Speaker 2>I think she doesn't like her body.</v>

895
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:29.880
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

896
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Let me think about how much emphasis they put on promoting Paige vanzant how</v>

897
00:22:34.571 --> 00:22:37.510
<v Speaker 2>much emphasis they put on a lot of other girls that are really pretty too,</v>

898
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:37.961
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

899
00:22:37.961 --> 00:22:39.160
<v Speaker 2>that's a marketing thing.</v>

900
00:22:39.161 --> 00:22:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

901
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:42.010
<v Speaker 2>you got to look at like what this company is now.</v>

902
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

903
00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:46.420
<v Speaker 2>This company started off a passion project by two fucking crazy billionaire</v>

904
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.690
<v Speaker 2>dudes.</v>

905
00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:46.871
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

906
00:22:46.871 --> 00:22:47.500
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

907
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.430
<v Speaker 2>Horian Gracie,</v>

908
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:48.941
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

909
00:22:48.941 --> 00:22:49.571
<v Speaker 2>Art Davies,</v>

910
00:22:49.571 --> 00:22:50.590
<v Speaker 2>the original guys,</v>

911
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

912
00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.130
<v Speaker 2>you know Meyrowitz those guys who started it off,</v>

913
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.060
<v Speaker 2>they get it going.</v>

914
00:22:55.061 --> 00:22:58.030
<v Speaker 2>Then they sell it as a passion project to,</v>

915
00:22:58.031 --> 00:23:00.760
<v Speaker 2>to Super Billionaires who love the sport,</v>

916
00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:01.893
<v Speaker 2>who train.</v>

917
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.450
<v Speaker 2>They were fucking like happy as pie and they're like,</v>

918
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:04.750
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

919
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:05.740
<v Speaker 2>we own the UFC.</v>

920
00:23:05.741 --> 00:23:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Dana talked him into it.</v>

921
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

922
00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:08.163
<v Speaker 2>didn't talk to me.</v>

923
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.570
<v Speaker 2>They're having a good old time.</v>

924
00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:14.050
<v Speaker 2>They literally were what me and Eddie Bravo used to pray for.</v>

925
00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.830
<v Speaker 2>We s when we were watching the fights back when nobody gave a shit about the UFC</v>

926
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.570
<v Speaker 2>thing we always said was,</v>

927
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.100
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't it be amazing if some billionaires just through a shitload of money at</v>

928
00:23:24.101 --> 00:23:25.060
<v Speaker 2>it and made it famous?</v>

929
00:23:25.061 --> 00:23:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Like we know it's an an incredible sport to watch.</v>

930
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.140
<v Speaker 2>We know how exciting it is.</v>

931
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't it be great if someone had just publicize this thing and then the</v>

932
00:23:32.831 --> 00:23:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Fertittas come along literally like they just,</v>

933
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.580
<v Speaker 2>they figured it out themselves.</v>

934
00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:36.851
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

935
00:23:36.851 --> 00:23:37.810
<v Speaker 2>this thing is like,</v>

936
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:39.190
<v Speaker 2>we just need to spend money.</v>

937
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:39.910
<v Speaker 2>They spent,</v>

938
00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:44.470
<v Speaker 2>they were $40 million in the hole when the first ultimate fighter was Erin.</v>

939
00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:44.621
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

940
00:23:44.621 --> 00:23:45.830
<v Speaker 2>So they put that much money into it,</v>

941
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.260
<v Speaker 2>produce the ultimate fighter.</v>

942
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 2>Lorenzo's a genius.</v>

943
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:51.350
<v Speaker 2>And then the show takes off the shot.</v>

944
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.131
<v Speaker 2>And this is by the way,</v>

945
00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:54.980
<v Speaker 2>after they had called Dana White and told him to bail,</v>

946
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.180
<v Speaker 2>they like sell this thing,</v>

947
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:57.320
<v Speaker 2>we're losing too much money.</v>

948
00:23:57.321 --> 00:23:57.890
<v Speaker 2>We were,</v>

949
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:58.191
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

950
00:23:58.191 --> 00:23:59.720
<v Speaker 2>x amount of millions of dollars in the hole.</v>

951
00:23:59.721 --> 00:24:03.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to lose my family's business all because of this one project that</v>

952
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:03.681
<v Speaker 2>we have.</v>

953
00:24:03.681 --> 00:24:04.514
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this.</v>

954
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.020
<v Speaker 2>And then he calls him up the next day and he goes,</v>

955
00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:06.861
<v Speaker 2>I changed from,</v>

956
00:24:06.861 --> 00:24:11.861
<v Speaker 2>he slept on it because he's a fucking genius I think.</v>

957
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I think Lorenzo's the most,</v>

958
00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:14.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

959
00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.890
<v Speaker 2>there's one a one B,</v>

960
00:24:15.891 --> 00:24:19.210
<v Speaker 2>but he's right up there as most important people and he's so calm history.</v>

961
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:19.670
<v Speaker 2>He was the,</v>

962
00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:23.090
<v Speaker 2>he was an important like balancing act to Dana Dana.</v>

963
00:24:23.091 --> 00:24:27.920
<v Speaker 2>So volatile and crazy emotional guy and he's a faggot and this and all the</v>

964
00:24:27.921 --> 00:24:28.630
<v Speaker 2>craziness of the day.</v>

965
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:30.380
<v Speaker 2>And especially in the early days used to be.</v>

966
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.770
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes from that to super calm,</v>

967
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:34.910
<v Speaker 2>really reasonable,</v>

968
00:24:34.911 --> 00:24:36.020
<v Speaker 2>incredibly articulate,</v>

969
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.970
<v Speaker 2>like laid back Lorenzo,</v>

970
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.691
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

971
00:24:38.691 --> 00:24:39.860
<v Speaker 2>I think he's missed now.</v>

972
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.110
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

973
00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Now that things are going on.</v>

974
00:24:41.151 --> 00:24:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Like you would never seen the Floyd Mayweather,</v>

975
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.660
<v Speaker 2>Conor fight if Lorenza was there because he that he would've never let that</v>

976
00:24:47.661 --> 00:24:48.494
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

977
00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.150
<v Speaker 2>He really wasn't into that stuff.</v>

978
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.140
<v Speaker 2>He really wasn't man.</v>

979
00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:51.361
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

980
00:24:51.361 --> 00:24:51.980
<v Speaker 2>you're crazy.</v>

981
00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I like,</v>

982
00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:53.930
<v Speaker 2>he didn't like spectacle.</v>

983
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.570
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

984
00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.150
<v Speaker 2>but why would you pass on that thing?</v>

985
00:24:56.151 --> 00:24:57.110
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to see that.</v>

986
00:24:57.111 --> 00:24:57.950
<v Speaker 2>Didn't you want to see that?</v>

987
00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Cellie?</v>

988
00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.600
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to see it.</v>

989
00:24:59.601 --> 00:25:00.440
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to see it.</v>

990
00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:03.770
<v Speaker 2>But Lorenzo I think looked at the bigger picture because I think now that we</v>

991
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:07.310
<v Speaker 2>look back on Floyd and and Connor and then where the UFC at now,</v>

992
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if was the best decision.</v>

993
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.010
<v Speaker 2>It's a great decision.</v>

994
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.600
<v Speaker 2>I think it was an amazing decision.</v>

995
00:25:11.601 --> 00:25:11.961
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

996
00:25:11.961 --> 00:25:15.860
<v Speaker 2>it's an amazing decision for the overall evolution of combat sports.</v>

997
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.450
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly important.</v>

998
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.320
<v Speaker 2>No chance.</v>

999
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:23.150
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly important to realize that a real specialist like Floyd</v>

1000
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Mayweather will run circles around someone who does not have the same amount of</v>

1001
00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:29.300
<v Speaker 2>time and knowledge.</v>

1002
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Like Connor has great punching power,</v>

1003
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:32.750
<v Speaker 2>he's got great speed.</v>

1004
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.370
<v Speaker 2>But as far as his like boxing acumen to compare the two of them the greatest of</v>

1005
00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:38.120
<v Speaker 2>all time,</v>

1006
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:38.953
<v Speaker 2>arguably no,</v>

1007
00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:39.590
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

1008
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.930
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

1009
00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:40.763
<v Speaker 2>there's no event.</v>

1010
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.260
<v Speaker 2>Please caveat that with the fact that Floyd Mayweather didn't even fight him the</v>

1011
00:25:45.261 --> 00:25:46.310
<v Speaker 2>way he fights other guys.</v>

1012
00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:47.810
<v Speaker 2>If you'd want it not to be touched,</v>

1013
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:48.644
<v Speaker 2>he could have done that.</v>

1014
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.920
<v Speaker 2>You disagree with that towards some made him work hard and I don't think it wore</v>

1015
00:25:51.921 --> 00:25:52.754
<v Speaker 2>him out.</v>

1016
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:54.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's great.</v>

1017
00:25:54.621 --> 00:25:55.490
<v Speaker 2>And those are great points.</v>

1018
00:25:55.491 --> 00:25:58.520
<v Speaker 2>But I think if you look at the lay of the lay of the land now,</v>

1019
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Lorenza wouldn't have done it because now you have two divisions held up.</v>

1020
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.950
<v Speaker 2>You have Connor with all this power.</v>

1021
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:05.360
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea what he's going to fight.</v>

1022
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.620
<v Speaker 2>He didn't ever have to fight again.</v>

1023
00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.910
<v Speaker 2>So he missed out on Connor.</v>

1024
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.410
<v Speaker 2>If you want to sell the TV deals,</v>

1025
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.090
<v Speaker 2>you can't guarantee Connor's gonna fight.</v>

1026
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:15.290
<v Speaker 2>That's why Lorenza and is a thing there.</v>

1027
00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:15.710
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>

1028
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:20.710
<v Speaker 2>Also also now we're in the era of the money fight where everyone wants the money</v>

1029
00:26:21.351 --> 00:26:22.250
<v Speaker 2>for rankings.</v>

1030
00:26:22.251 --> 00:26:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Don't matter.</v>

1031
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Divisions don't matter.</v>

1032
00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Titles don't matter,</v>

1033
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.190
<v Speaker 2>so we've lost all that kind of the,</v>

1034
00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.750
<v Speaker 2>the the fundamental that we've laid out.</v>

1035
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.890
<v Speaker 2>No title shots and all.</v>

1036
00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:31.600
<v Speaker 2>I disagree.</v>

1037
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.320
<v Speaker 2>I think now everyone wants to famous fight.</v>

1038
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll do want the famous fighters.</v>

1039
00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:36.303
<v Speaker 2>Here's the money.</v>

1040
00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second.</v>

1041
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.813
<v Speaker 2>This is not,</v>

1042
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.650
<v Speaker 2>we haven't lost all the rankings.</v>

1043
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.780
<v Speaker 2>We just lost a ranking sometimes.</v>

1044
00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they don't matter.</v>

1045
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:44.580
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

1046
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.030
<v Speaker 2>this is a lot of it is because the $4 billion price tag of that company,</v>

1047
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:48.830
<v Speaker 2>that's a big part of it.</v>

1048
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Well a lot of us cause the fighters,</v>

1049
00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't want your money because the people that own the fight,</v>

1050
00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:51.960
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1051
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.180
<v Speaker 2>the company now or an entertainment business were like,</v>

1052
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:54.900
<v Speaker 2>where's the money?</v>

1053
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.640
<v Speaker 2>The money's in these big spectacle things.</v>

1054
00:26:56.641 --> 00:26:57.450
<v Speaker 2>That's where the money is.</v>

1055
00:26:57.450 --> 00:26:58.283
<v Speaker 2>We're here to make some money.</v>

1056
00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.580
<v Speaker 2>We're here to put on great fights.</v>

1057
00:26:59.730 --> 00:26:59.941
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1058
00:26:59.941 --> 00:27:02.820
<v Speaker 2>you can't tell me that fucking Detroit card was one of the wildest fight cards</v>

1059
00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:04.200
<v Speaker 2>you've ever seen in your life and put it on,</v>

1060
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.750
<v Speaker 2>put on great fucking fights.</v>

1061
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:08.070
<v Speaker 2>They're putting on great cards.</v>

1062
00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.270
<v Speaker 2>And on top of that,</v>

1063
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.310
<v Speaker 2>they're also having chaos.</v>

1064
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:13.290
<v Speaker 2>They're having Conor McGregor box,</v>

1065
00:27:13.291 --> 00:27:14.124
<v Speaker 2>Floyd Mayweather.</v>

1066
00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.220
<v Speaker 2>But I think for the evolution of combat sports,</v>

1067
00:27:16.221 --> 00:27:17.490
<v Speaker 2>that fight is important.</v>

1068
00:27:17.491 --> 00:27:18.001
<v Speaker 2>How do they,</v>

1069
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:21.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it lended itself to the evolution of combat sports in that there</v>

1070
00:27:21.831 --> 00:27:24.200
<v Speaker 2>was such different sports so that I,</v>

1071
00:27:24.201 --> 00:27:27.630
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody would knew that ultimately we need to see it.</v>

1072
00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1073
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:28.861
<v Speaker 2>Like James,</v>

1074
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:30.590
<v Speaker 2>Tony [inaudible],</v>

1075
00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:34.650
<v Speaker 2>Tony or Randy couture fight is not fair because James Tony halfassed that he</v>

1076
00:27:34.651 --> 00:27:35.550
<v Speaker 2>barely trained,</v>

1077
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.050
<v Speaker 2>he didn't train any grappling.</v>

1078
00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.730
<v Speaker 2>We saw him doing his training with some karate guy and he was like,</v>

1079
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.780
<v Speaker 2>we did this stuff to,</v>

1080
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:42.000
<v Speaker 2>even with the milky.</v>

1081
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:42.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1082
00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:43.400
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1083
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:48.090
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing with James Tony did was try to just go in there and get</v>

1084
00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:48.660
<v Speaker 2>paid.</v>

1085
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.030
<v Speaker 2>He got taken down with a low ankle pick.</v>

1086
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.490
<v Speaker 2>He got to completely smashed by.</v>

1087
00:27:53.491 --> 00:27:54.630
<v Speaker 2>Really built as a temp.</v>

1088
00:27:54.631 --> 00:27:55.350
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1089
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.220
<v Speaker 2>He's out of shape.</v>

1090
00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:56.600
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>

1091
00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.360
<v Speaker 2>He's way past prime where theirs is fucking prime.</v>

1092
00:28:00.361 --> 00:28:03.260
<v Speaker 2>Even though he's 40 he's still so good.</v>

1093
00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.153
<v Speaker 2>His prime,</v>

1094
00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.310
<v Speaker 2>he's lost a step.</v>

1095
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.630
<v Speaker 2>You can't say he's lost a step.</v>

1096
00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:07.670
<v Speaker 2>You look at him against me.</v>

1097
00:28:07.671 --> 00:28:11.310
<v Speaker 2>Tell me a 26 year old Floyd mailing eats that up cut coming landed on him.</v>

1098
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.650
<v Speaker 2>If he fought that way it's a pen.</v>

1099
00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:16.770
<v Speaker 2>If you tried to just walk towards him like he had nothing he did,</v>

1100
00:28:16.771 --> 00:28:17.780
<v Speaker 2>he stood in his garage,</v>

1101
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.090
<v Speaker 2>kind of cracked him with that one shot and I think Floyd was like,</v>

1102
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:21.600
<v Speaker 2>oh okay,</v>

1103
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.050
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1104
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:22.291
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1105
00:28:22.291 --> 00:28:23.090
<v Speaker 2>you can hit me.</v>

1106
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:23.401
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1107
00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:24.234
<v Speaker 2>we had to get going on.</v>

1108
00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:24.601
<v Speaker 2>Well let me,</v>

1109
00:28:24.601 --> 00:28:29.460
<v Speaker 2>let me just start ramping this bitch up to nine quizzing you a little bit.</v>

1110
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:33.720
<v Speaker 2>I think you in May whether on Conor McGregor stuff more than anyone and I love</v>

1111
00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:34.710
<v Speaker 2>it cause comedy got paid.</v>

1112
00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying Lorenza from a business aspect is going,</v>

1113
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.910
<v Speaker 2>if we give all this guy the fucking power now the ball's in his court,</v>

1114
00:28:41.911 --> 00:28:42.121
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1115
00:28:42.121 --> 00:28:42.280
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1116
00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:43.260
<v Speaker 2>that's not what we're about.</v>

1117
00:28:43.261 --> 00:28:45.630
<v Speaker 2>That's what my thoughts and now everyone else's fault,</v>

1118
00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:47.460
<v Speaker 2>you get a superstar.</v>

1119
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:48.960
<v Speaker 2>The only way you get a sugar ray Leonard,</v>

1120
00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:49.241
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1121
00:28:49.241 --> 00:28:54.241
<v Speaker 2>Muhammad Ali don't dose th th th the cult of personality that comes around those</v>

1122
00:28:54.301 --> 00:28:54.620
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1123
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.160
<v Speaker 2>they do have all the power.</v>

1124
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.150
<v Speaker 2>There's no getting away.</v>

1125
00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.611
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>

1126
00:28:57.611 --> 00:28:57.991
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

1127
00:28:57.991 --> 00:29:00.270
<v Speaker 2>you can't stop that as a promotional organization.</v>

1128
00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:04.770
<v Speaker 2>You have to somehow or another ride with the wave and make some sort of cohesive</v>

1129
00:29:04.771 --> 00:29:04.950
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1130
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:05.880
<v Speaker 2>may also want to be checked.</v>

1131
00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.580
<v Speaker 2>Got To make some side of agreement with that person.</v>

1132
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:09.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1133
00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.400
<v Speaker 2>I made it with Brock Lesnar.</v>

1134
00:29:11.401 --> 00:29:12.570
<v Speaker 2>They may deal with Ronda Rousey,</v>

1135
00:29:12.571 --> 00:29:15.270
<v Speaker 2>the other really the only other two superstars.</v>

1136
00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.313
<v Speaker 2>But they did it.</v>

1137
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.850
<v Speaker 2>They didn't last because when see what keeps him,</v>

1138
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:19.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1139
00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:19.953
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1140
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:21.540
<v Speaker 2>a champion relevant and,</v>

1141
00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:23.760
<v Speaker 2>and in the lure is,</v>

1142
00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.640
<v Speaker 2>is the guy who keeps answering the call.</v>

1143
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:27.140
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1144
00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.820
<v Speaker 2>and Connor did that in two different weight classes.</v>

1145
00:29:29.821 --> 00:29:30.271
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

1146
00:29:30.271 --> 00:29:30.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1147
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:30.921
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1148
00:29:30.921 --> 00:29:34.680
<v Speaker 2>he beat the impossible to be and then people,</v>

1149
00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.990
<v Speaker 2>cause he hasn't defended a bite and what he's done is that,</v>

1150
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:38.791
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

1151
00:29:38.791 --> 00:29:40.860
<v Speaker 2>That's why I agree with your point about the evolution of the combat.</v>

1152
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.600
<v Speaker 2>What it's done now is put so much power in his hands.</v>

1153
00:29:43.601 --> 00:29:43.811
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

1154
00:29:43.811 --> 00:29:44.860
<v Speaker 2>he's got $100 million,</v>

1155
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:45.140
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1156
00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.020
<v Speaker 2>It happens to me too,</v>

1157
00:29:47.021 --> 00:29:47.771
<v Speaker 2>cause I liked the guy,</v>

1158
00:29:47.771 --> 00:29:49.990
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time like it's,</v>

1159
00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:51.160
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to see him.</v>

1160
00:29:51.161 --> 00:29:56.161
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to see him fight d these monsters like Tony [inaudible] Tony</v>

1161
00:29:57.881 --> 00:29:58.714
<v Speaker 2>this year.</v>

1162
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Why would you say that he,</v>

1163
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.120
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1164
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't like anybody saying this guy's not going to do this or he's not going to</v>

1165
00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:04.990
<v Speaker 2>do that because we really don't know.</v>

1166
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.350
<v Speaker 2>But why wouldn't he fight Tony Ferguson if he wants to fight a guy?</v>

1167
00:30:08.351 --> 00:30:10.120
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen him even training.</v>

1168
00:30:10.121 --> 00:30:10.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1169
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.850
<v Speaker 2>Straight nonstop.</v>

1170
00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Do you fall on its wrong Brian now,</v>

1171
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:16.873
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to fight.</v>

1172
00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.580
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't come to my house.</v>

1173
00:30:18.581 --> 00:30:20.490
<v Speaker 2>She hasn't been training in Santa Monica and that's the right way.</v>

1174
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.460
<v Speaker 2>Where are you going to sand tray?</v>

1175
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.230
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is I didn't mentioned fighting</v>

1176
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:28.710
<v Speaker 2>each other back and fight back and forth.</v>

1177
00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:29.501
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

1178
00:30:29.501 --> 00:30:29.741
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1179
00:30:29.741 --> 00:30:30.730
<v Speaker 2>are you going to box pack yet?</v>

1180
00:30:30.731 --> 00:30:30.911
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1181
00:30:30.911 --> 00:30:31.031
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1182
00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:32.620
<v Speaker 2>my next fight is mixed martial arts.</v>

1183
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:33.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to find inside that octagon.</v>

1184
00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:34.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1185
00:30:34.091 --> 00:30:35.590
<v Speaker 2>He said to my next one is going to be a real fight.</v>

1186
00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.530
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's going to fight 20 freaks and that Tony freaks and fight.</v>

1187
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:38.920
<v Speaker 2>When I,</v>

1188
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.920
<v Speaker 2>when I look at it more and more,</v>

1189
00:30:39.921 --> 00:30:40.754
<v Speaker 2>I watch footage.</v>

1190
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:41.740
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

1191
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.880
<v Speaker 2>it's not that bad of a matchup or Carla used to be like,</v>

1192
00:30:43.881 --> 00:30:44.021
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

1193
00:30:44.021 --> 00:30:44.854
<v Speaker 2>that's a tough fight.</v>

1194
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.110
<v Speaker 2>But I think early on,</v>

1195
00:30:46.111 --> 00:30:47.290
<v Speaker 2>especially early rounds,</v>

1196
00:30:47.291 --> 00:30:49.870
<v Speaker 2>one through three with Connors accuracy and the,</v>

1197
00:30:49.871 --> 00:30:51.100
<v Speaker 2>and the way Tony gets hit,</v>

1198
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:55.030
<v Speaker 2>it's a good fight for cares to past the third round.</v>

1199
00:30:55.031 --> 00:30:56.770
<v Speaker 2>It could get to parts of problem.</v>

1200
00:30:56.771 --> 00:30:59.260
<v Speaker 2>One Tony Finishes motherfuckers off his back.</v>

1201
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.960
<v Speaker 2>He is nasty off his back if he can come down.</v>

1202
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1203
00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.491
<v Speaker 2>If he gets taken down,</v>

1204
00:31:03.491 --> 00:31:04.870
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean I'm saying if he gets hit,</v>

1205
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:09.010
<v Speaker 2>if he gets hit like Nate Diaz does and goes down like Connor is not,</v>

1206
00:31:09.011 --> 00:31:11.800
<v Speaker 2>it's not like 100% that he's going to beat him up and ground and pound them.</v>

1207
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:12.190
<v Speaker 2>Tony,</v>

1208
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.210
<v Speaker 2>if he gets dropped,</v>

1209
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.000
<v Speaker 2>we'll wrap you up like a fucking mummy and submit you.</v>

1210
00:31:16.001 --> 00:31:16.990
<v Speaker 2>So we can do though.</v>

1211
00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:17.371
<v Speaker 2>And Connor,</v>

1212
00:31:17.371 --> 00:31:18.370
<v Speaker 2>does it entertain that?</v>

1213
00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.740
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Nate?</v>

1214
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1215
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:22.110
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1216
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying like you don't,</v>

1217
00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.220
<v Speaker 2>and they certainly can.</v>

1218
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.960
<v Speaker 2>The difference is the differences.</v>

1219
00:31:25.961 --> 00:31:26.794
<v Speaker 2>If Tony Goes,</v>

1220
00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:27.723
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1221
00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.010
<v Speaker 2>I know you're fast apart from these first three rounds.</v>

1222
00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:30.621
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1223
00:31:30.621 --> 00:31:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm a college collegiate wrestler.</v>

1224
00:31:32.351 --> 00:31:33.071
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this noise.</v>

1225
00:31:33.071 --> 00:31:34.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to ankle pick you all fucking day.</v>

1226
00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:35.360
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

1227
00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:35.831
<v Speaker 2>Then third,</v>

1228
00:31:35.831 --> 00:31:36.131
<v Speaker 2>fourth,</v>

1229
00:31:36.131 --> 00:31:36.341
<v Speaker 2>fifth,</v>

1230
00:31:36.341 --> 00:31:37.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm start striking with you,</v>

1231
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.840
<v Speaker 2>but Connor could catch him wet laundry.</v>

1232
00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:41.290
<v Speaker 2>It's a good fight.</v>

1233
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:42.370
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous speed.</v>

1234
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Tony doesn't get tired.</v>

1235
00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.680
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen him get tired.</v>

1236
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:45.671
<v Speaker 2>He's tired.</v>

1237
00:31:45.671 --> 00:31:49.150
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't show it cause he's a fucking serial killer.</v>

1238
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:49.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1239
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.720
<v Speaker 2>He is less tired than the other guy.</v>

1240
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:52.091
<v Speaker 2>Your Mama,</v>

1241
00:31:52.091 --> 00:31:52.751
<v Speaker 2>she gets tired.</v>

1242
00:31:52.751 --> 00:31:53.770
<v Speaker 2>Brian last time.</v>

1243
00:31:53.771 --> 00:31:55.720
<v Speaker 2>Everybody gets tired and it's just here for it.</v>

1244
00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:55.990
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1245
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.561
<v Speaker 2>but it is.</v>

1246
00:31:56.561 --> 00:31:58.510
<v Speaker 2>But he also is ridiculous conditioning.</v>

1247
00:31:58.511 --> 00:32:01.660
<v Speaker 2>You Know Amy Bravo was his fucking Jujitsu trainer and Eddie said he's never</v>

1248
00:32:01.661 --> 00:32:02.800
<v Speaker 2>seen anything like this guy.</v>

1249
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.080
<v Speaker 2>He said the guy who trains for six hours a day,</v>

1250
00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:05.980
<v Speaker 2>the cities,</v>

1251
00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:07.660
<v Speaker 2>he's in big Barry's running hills,</v>

1252
00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.880
<v Speaker 2>literally lapping his training partners.</v>

1253
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:11.950
<v Speaker 2>I turned around and go back and run a trail,</v>

1254
00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.400
<v Speaker 2>run up to the top of that.</v>

1255
00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.980
<v Speaker 2>That is such an advantage.</v>

1256
00:32:14.981 --> 00:32:15.940
<v Speaker 2>And a five round fight.</v>

1257
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.241
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1258
00:32:16.241 --> 00:32:17.620
<v Speaker 2>such an advantage and a three round fight.</v>

1259
00:32:17.621 --> 00:32:17.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1260
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:21.430
<v Speaker 2>his ability to just not like when you're less tired than the other guy.</v>

1261
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.111
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1262
00:32:22.111 --> 00:32:23.170
<v Speaker 2>Those camps are big bear.</v>

1263
00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:23.621
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1264
00:32:23.621 --> 00:32:24.460
<v Speaker 2>he rents a house.</v>

1265
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.320
<v Speaker 2>He builds his own fucking training facility.</v>

1266
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.910
<v Speaker 2>He sets up his own heavy bags.</v>

1267
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.200
<v Speaker 2>He mats up floors,</v>

1268
00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:30.490
<v Speaker 2>he takes a fucking room.</v>

1269
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.600
<v Speaker 2>He's got like a living room,</v>

1270
00:32:31.601 --> 00:32:32.200
<v Speaker 2>but house.</v>

1271
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.460
<v Speaker 2>He sets down the borders,</v>

1272
00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:35.440
<v Speaker 2>brings in the mats and they start training.</v>

1273
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:36.850
<v Speaker 2>He refines of hills,</v>

1274
00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:39.230
<v Speaker 2>runs those fucking hills at 6,000 feet out to</v>

1275
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.010
<v Speaker 1>50 fives no punk men.</v>

1276
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.410
<v Speaker 1>He's not asked Eddie Alvarez who we can now,</v>

1277
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:46.750
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking punk.</v>

1278
00:32:46.751 --> 00:32:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Not to say like at first I was like,</v>

1279
00:32:48.711 --> 00:32:48.861
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1280
00:32:48.861 --> 00:32:50.600
<v Speaker 1>this is getting kind of the way I look at him.</v>

1281
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:51.434
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1282
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:51.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1283
00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.780
<v Speaker 1>he does get hit first and gets hit man.</v>

1284
00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1285
00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.990
<v Speaker 1>The problem child is Khabib,</v>

1286
00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Khabib [inaudible].</v>

1287
00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:00.140
<v Speaker 1>It's almost a round table because it could be verse Tony.</v>

1288
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:00.471
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

1289
00:33:00.471 --> 00:33:01.304
<v Speaker 1>A fight could,</v>

1290
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.510
<v Speaker 1>could be versus Connor.</v>

1291
00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:02.811
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1292
00:33:02.811 --> 00:33:03.710
<v Speaker 1>that's tough fight for Conor,</v>

1293
00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:05.180
<v Speaker 1>but they can eliminate each other.</v>

1294
00:33:05.181 --> 00:33:06.410
<v Speaker 1>It's whoever shows up that night.</v>

1295
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking good fight,</v>

1296
00:33:07.491 --> 00:33:08.324
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1297
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Takes your legs down.</v>

1298
00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:11.970
<v Speaker 1>We're going to know all about,</v>

1299
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:14.610
<v Speaker 1>could be this weekend when he fights Edson Barboza.</v>

1300
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.760
<v Speaker 1>We're going to see him with arguably the fastest tracker and 155 pounds.</v>

1301
00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:19.760
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't give a fuck about going the ground.</v>

1302
00:33:19.761 --> 00:33:20.031
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1303
00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:20.270
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1304
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:21.081
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to ground.</v>

1305
00:33:21.081 --> 00:33:22.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm might be on a team that were other guys.</v>

1306
00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:23.773
<v Speaker 1>We'll play that game.</v>

1307
00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1308
00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Anti wrestling will kick you in the fucking face.</v>

1309
00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1310
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:30.470
<v Speaker 1>but how do you keep them from taking you to the ground when he gets into my</v>

1311
00:33:30.471 --> 00:33:30.770
<v Speaker 1>work?</v>

1312
00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:31.760
<v Speaker 1>You avoid the clinch.</v>

1313
00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1314
00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:32.661
<v Speaker 1>How do you avoid that?</v>

1315
00:33:32.661 --> 00:33:33.440
<v Speaker 1>With Khabib?</v>

1316
00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Hard.</v>

1317
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:34.941
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking hard.</v>

1318
00:33:34.941 --> 00:33:35.301
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1319
00:33:35.301 --> 00:33:36.140
<v Speaker 1>it's not an easy fight.</v>

1320
00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Five stretch of the imagination,</v>

1321
00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.710
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to realize to be Michael Johnson.</v>

1322
00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Crack could be when they fought and had them wobbling.</v>

1323
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:45.680
<v Speaker 1>It's the first time we've seen any adversity that could be you had to face</v>

1324
00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:46.431
<v Speaker 1>inside the octagon.</v>

1325
00:33:46.431 --> 00:33:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Buddy handled it with fucking four aces.</v>

1326
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Took him to the ground.</v>

1327
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.631
<v Speaker 1>He's got to show him.</v>

1328
00:33:50.631 --> 00:33:54.200
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea it could be one up to two oh five when he trains like well he gets</v>

1329
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:54.860
<v Speaker 1>heavy,</v>

1330
00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.260
<v Speaker 1>he gets heavy in between five 29 due at this time.</v>

1331
00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Cormier I say as a new nutrition and he said he is been lighter getting</v>

1332
00:34:01.851 --> 00:34:03.260
<v Speaker 1>ready for this camp than any fight before.</v>

1333
00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.670
<v Speaker 1>He was 179 pounds.</v>

1334
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Just a couple of weeks ago,</v>

1335
00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Josh Thompson was like,</v>

1336
00:34:06.621 --> 00:34:06.831
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

1343
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.450
<v Speaker 1>I've seem to all the guys and think about,</v>

1344
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.231
<v Speaker 1>think about what he did.</v>

1345
00:34:15.231 --> 00:34:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Joe Angeles,</v>

1346
00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:17.030
<v Speaker 1>think about what he did.</v>

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:21.110
<v Speaker 1>He bragged them [inaudible] 70 and I go,</v>

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.491
<v Speaker 1>Just go to set me up.</v>

1350
00:34:22.491 --> 00:34:23.390
<v Speaker 1>He sees what he's going to,</v>

1351
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:28.430
<v Speaker 1>he's going to do is get the belt at 55 as soon as he get that he's going piece</v>

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:43.041
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1362
00:34:43.041 --> 00:34:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Whether you're talking about Dave Schultz or whether you're talking about,</v>

1363
00:34:46.221 --> 00:34:47.054
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1364
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:48.703
<v Speaker 1>Carolyn,</v>

1365
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:51.080
<v Speaker 1>all the best of the best wrestlers,</v>

1366
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:54.170
<v Speaker 1>they have an ability to enforce their will,</v>

1367
00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:59.760
<v Speaker 1>power into God and do shit to them that they don't want don and break up.</v>

1368
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.590
<v Speaker 1>They see it.</v>

1369
00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:03.080
<v Speaker 1>They were you like a technique with will,</v>

1370
00:35:03.081 --> 00:35:04.250
<v Speaker 1>with physical conditioning,</v>

1371
00:35:04.251 --> 00:35:05.084
<v Speaker 1>with everything.</v>

1372
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Bdcs the same way.</v>

1373
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.410
<v Speaker 1>All the best guys have everything.</v>

1374
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:10.970
<v Speaker 1>They have all the components,</v>

1375
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.021
<v Speaker 1>and that's one of the things.</v>

1376
00:35:12.021 --> 00:35:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Number Command off does.</v>

1377
00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Then you add the fact that he's from Dagestan.</v>

1378
00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.470
<v Speaker 1>You add the fact that he grew up in one of the hardest places in the fucking</v>

1379
00:35:18.471 --> 00:35:18.740
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

1380
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:19.250
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1381
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:21.440
<v Speaker 1>And everyone around him as hard as nails,</v>

1382
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:23.900
<v Speaker 1>where I think the national sport might be wrestling,</v>

1383
00:35:23.901 --> 00:35:24.650
<v Speaker 1>might be murder.</v>

1384
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:25.483
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1385
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:27.770
<v Speaker 1>Get a varsity in murder in high school.</v>

1386
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:30.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy place,</v>

1387
00:35:30.561 --> 00:35:32.350
<v Speaker 1>which we discussed is him verse Barboza.</v>

1388
00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.560
<v Speaker 1>If it's like a video game,</v>

1389
00:35:33.561 --> 00:35:36.200
<v Speaker 1>you look at their attributes Barboza strikings like this,</v>

1390
00:35:36.201 --> 00:35:37.034
<v Speaker 1>but just wrestling's like,</v>

1391
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:37.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1392
00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:37.771
<v Speaker 1>we like,</v>

1393
00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 1>it could</v>

1394
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.420
<v Speaker 2>be his wrestling's like this,</v>

1395
00:35:39.421 --> 00:35:39.920
<v Speaker 2>but striking.</v>

1396
00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.400
<v Speaker 2>So you're intrigued by this.</v>

1397
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:42.450
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

1398
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.313
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>

1399
00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:48.100
<v Speaker 2>Fuck is the most intriguing fight that it could be was ever fought by fog.</v>

1400
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.541
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

1401
00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:49.374
<v Speaker 2>Two reasons.</v>

1402
00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:49.890
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1403
00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 2>the two fights where he had so much difficulty making weight that his body was</v>

1404
00:35:53.941 --> 00:35:54.571
<v Speaker 2>shutting down.</v>

1405
00:35:54.571 --> 00:35:56.190
<v Speaker 2>It happened in the Michael Johnson fight.</v>

1406
00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:57.160
<v Speaker 2>Then it happened again.</v>

1407
00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:57.630
<v Speaker 2>The Toby,</v>

1408
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:58.231
<v Speaker 2>Tony Ferguson.</v>

1409
00:35:58.231 --> 00:36:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Five th the point they pulled them off the car,</v>

1410
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.390
<v Speaker 2>so they were saying his liver was shutting down like this is serious,</v>

1411
00:36:03.391 --> 00:36:04.224
<v Speaker 2>serious shit.</v>

1412
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:06.390
<v Speaker 2>He has not made one 55 cents.</v>

1413
00:36:06.391 --> 00:36:06.661
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1414
00:36:06.661 --> 00:36:07.680
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't fought since,</v>

1415
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.160
<v Speaker 2>so there's so much pressure on him to do this correctly,</v>

1416
00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.600
<v Speaker 2>but who knows if he can.</v>

1417
00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:15.360
<v Speaker 2>When your body does not want to do that anymore,</v>

1418
00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:17.910
<v Speaker 2>you run into serious problems is one of the things that happens to older</v>

1419
00:36:17.911 --> 00:36:20.700
<v Speaker 2>athletes when they've been cutting extreme amounts of weight over and over</v>

1420
00:36:20.701 --> 00:36:21.120
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1421
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.930
<v Speaker 2>They get to a point where their bodies take every time you cut 30 pounds of</v>

1422
00:36:24.931 --> 00:36:26.010
<v Speaker 2>water from your body,</v>

1423
00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.890
<v Speaker 2>your body goes into like a state of shock.</v>

1424
00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:30.360
<v Speaker 2>You do some damage.</v>

1425
00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.280
<v Speaker 2>The question is how much damage are you doing?</v>

1426
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Think how long he's been doing it to Josh Johnson brought to that point.</v>

1427
00:36:35.131 --> 00:36:35.431
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1428
00:36:35.431 --> 00:36:35.641
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1429
00:36:35.641 --> 00:36:37.350
<v Speaker 2>he's been cutting weight since he was a kid.</v>

1430
00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:39.030
<v Speaker 2>Like he's been in these wrestling terms,</v>

1431
00:36:39.031 --> 00:36:40.410
<v Speaker 2>the Samba terms since he was a kid.</v>

1432
00:36:40.411 --> 00:36:41.700
<v Speaker 2>So He's older now.</v>

1433
00:36:41.701 --> 00:36:43.560
<v Speaker 2>He's been cutting weight for a fucking f.</v>

1434
00:36:43.561 --> 00:36:44.670
<v Speaker 2>And here's a real question.</v>

1435
00:36:44.671 --> 00:36:45.381
<v Speaker 2>Here's a real question,</v>

1436
00:36:45.381 --> 00:36:46.860
<v Speaker 2>and fought for the title.</v>

1437
00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:47.970
<v Speaker 2>If he wins the title,</v>

1438
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.490
<v Speaker 2>how the fuck is he going to defend it in California?</v>

1439
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:51.590
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to,</v>

1440
00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:51.800
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

1441
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:52.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1442
00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.150
<v Speaker 2>because California has new strict laws.</v>

1443
00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>

1444
00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:56.370
<v Speaker 2>he's not watching any foster.</v>

1445
00:36:56.371 --> 00:36:59.790
<v Speaker 2>The guy runs the California State Athletic Commission is one of the best guys in</v>

1446
00:36:59.791 --> 00:37:00.360
<v Speaker 2>the sport.</v>

1447
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.610
<v Speaker 2>He's so proactive.</v>

1448
00:37:01.611 --> 00:37:02.401
<v Speaker 2>He's so ahead of it.</v>

1449
00:37:02.401 --> 00:37:03.690
<v Speaker 2>He's adding weight classes.</v>

1450
00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:05.850
<v Speaker 2>He's doing so much to make this safe.</v>

1451
00:37:05.851 --> 00:37:06.241
<v Speaker 2>And he was a,</v>

1452
00:37:06.241 --> 00:37:07.260
<v Speaker 2>he's a martial artist,</v>

1453
00:37:07.261 --> 00:37:08.490
<v Speaker 2>lifelong martial artist himself,</v>

1454
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:09.713
<v Speaker 2>and he competed.</v>

1455
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:12.630
<v Speaker 2>So here's a guy who sees what the problems are and he says,</v>

1456
00:37:12.631 --> 00:37:12.841
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1457
00:37:12.841 --> 00:37:16.040
<v Speaker 2>we're going to make sure you don't weigh 15 pounds more when you get into the</v>

1458
00:37:16.041 --> 00:37:17.100
<v Speaker 2>octa the night of the fight.</v>

1459
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:17.993
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1460
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.440
<v Speaker 2>The other percentage,</v>

1461
00:37:19.441 --> 00:37:19.681
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1462
00:37:19.681 --> 00:37:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Is it a percentage of weight that you can't gain?</v>

1463
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:21.871
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1464
00:37:21.871 --> 00:37:22.081
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1465
00:37:22.081 --> 00:37:22.211
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1466
00:37:22.211 --> 00:37:23.580
<v Speaker 2>it's a little mound sites,</v>

1467
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:25.560
<v Speaker 2>I think at 55 can't come in and heavier than,</v>

1468
00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.480
<v Speaker 2>it's like 15.5 or something like that,</v>

1469
00:37:27.481 --> 00:37:30.090
<v Speaker 2>so like 70 which could be concurring bigger.</v>

1470
00:37:30.830 --> 00:37:33.420
<v Speaker 2>Bebes just going to get the top of them dip out public place in Tiba,</v>

1471
00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:33.830
<v Speaker 2>glycine,</v>

1472
00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:37.140
<v Speaker 2>Tiba would fight at 55 and he literally looked like he was 200 pounds in a</v>

1473
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.470
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

1474
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:37.921
<v Speaker 2>I heard,</v>

1475
00:37:37.921 --> 00:37:39.390
<v Speaker 2>I heard that Darren tell,</v>

1476
00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:40.650
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure you'll hear this,</v>

1477
00:37:40.651 --> 00:37:41.310
<v Speaker 2>but I already,</v>

1478
00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:45.120
<v Speaker 2>when he stepped into the octagon against cowboy and he was 201 pounds.</v>

1479
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:45.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1480
00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:46.110
<v Speaker 2>that's what I heard too.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Enjoy beating during tiller it.</v>

1482
00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:48.303
<v Speaker 2>Enjoy it.</v>

1483
00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1484
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:50.070
<v Speaker 2>no one wants to fight him.</v>

1485
00:37:50.071 --> 00:37:52.470
<v Speaker 2>He suffered much warranty for,</v>

1486
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:53.731
<v Speaker 2>he even said he fight.</v>

1487
00:37:53.731 --> 00:37:54.301
<v Speaker 2>My pay goes,</v>

1488
00:37:54.301 --> 00:37:54.601
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1489
00:37:54.601 --> 00:37:56.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck about rankings belt.</v>

1490
00:37:56.281 --> 00:37:57.090
<v Speaker 2>I'll fight right now.</v>

1491
00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:58.110
<v Speaker 2>He wants to put on a show,</v>

1492
00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.290
<v Speaker 2>he wants to light people on fire and no one wants to get in there with them.</v>

1493
00:38:01.291 --> 00:38:02.310
<v Speaker 2>They saw that cowboy fine.</v>

1494
00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:02.610
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1495
00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:03.920
<v Speaker 2>oh shoot.</v>

1496
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.130
<v Speaker 2>Then you learn a story like,</v>

1497
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:05.611
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1498
00:38:05.611 --> 00:38:06.300
<v Speaker 2>he's a nightmare.</v>

1499
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:07.133
<v Speaker 2>Wonderful,</v>

1500
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:07.591
<v Speaker 2>wonderful.</v>

1501
00:38:07.591 --> 00:38:07.921
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1502
00:38:07.921 --> 00:38:08.701
<v Speaker 2>let's do this.</v>

1503
00:38:08.701 --> 00:38:09.461
<v Speaker 2>Then when the boys dad,</v>

1504
00:38:09.461 --> 00:38:10.294
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

1505
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:10.571
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1506
00:38:10.571 --> 00:38:12.000
<v Speaker 2>but Wonderboy did not say let's do that.</v>

1507
00:38:12.001 --> 00:38:12.761
<v Speaker 2>Let me be honest with you.</v>

1508
00:38:12.761 --> 00:38:13.081
<v Speaker 2>I wonder.</v>

1509
00:38:13.081 --> 00:38:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Boy had hurt.</v>

1510
00:38:14.011 --> 00:38:14.431
<v Speaker 2>Thumbs said.</v>

1511
00:38:14.431 --> 00:38:16.920
<v Speaker 2>He told me about in the ring after the fight,</v>

1512
00:38:16.921 --> 00:38:19.320
<v Speaker 2>his thumbs in the cage after the fight.</v>

1513
00:38:19.321 --> 00:38:21.660
<v Speaker 2>He said his thumbs pretty fucked up cause he was talking about it in between</v>

1514
00:38:21.661 --> 00:38:23.130
<v Speaker 2>rounds with its corner and I said,</v>

1515
00:38:23.131 --> 00:38:24.090
<v Speaker 2>what were you saying about your hands?</v>

1516
00:38:24.091 --> 00:38:24.271
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1517
00:38:24.271 --> 00:38:24.631
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>

1518
00:38:24.631 --> 00:38:27.300
<v Speaker 2>I did something to my thumbs like I hit,</v>

1519
00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:31.040
<v Speaker 2>you know he's throwing these crazy fucking punches on a guy like Jorge Mas</v>

1520
00:38:31.041 --> 00:38:32.070
<v Speaker 2>withal who's no joke,</v>

1521
00:38:32.071 --> 00:38:32.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1522
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Hell No.</v>

1523
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:34.110
<v Speaker 2>He's catching elbows.</v>

1524
00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:36.160
<v Speaker 2>He's catching foreheads and he fucked</v>

1525
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.390
<v Speaker 3>us thumbs up and he might need surgery like he doesn't know has no,</v>

1526
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.713
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1527
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:44.770
<v Speaker 3>But for sure he was in a position where he had some serious injuries that they</v>

1528
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:48.210
<v Speaker 3>were saying like we got in Dana white even tweeted it or something that we</v>

1529
00:38:48.211 --> 00:38:48.480
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>

1530
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:49.960
<v Speaker 3>no days out the fight.</v>

1531
00:38:49.961 --> 00:38:50.141
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1532
00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:50.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1533
00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:52.300
<v Speaker 3>I even said thank you Jesus.</v>

1534
00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:54.670
<v Speaker 3>I screenshot it feeling like,</v>

1535
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:55.211
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

1536
00:38:55.211 --> 00:38:56.044
<v Speaker 3>it's going down.</v>

1537
00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:57.670
<v Speaker 3>That's a great fight.</v>

1538
00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:58.240
<v Speaker 3>Great fight.</v>

1539
00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:58.811
<v Speaker 3>If it happened,</v>

1540
00:38:58.811 --> 00:39:01.270
<v Speaker 3>boy or boy who fought Errol Spence.</v>

1541
00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:01.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1542
00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:02.970
<v Speaker 3>I was just with uh,</v>

1543
00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.900
<v Speaker 3>a fight to wildcard west.</v>

1544
00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.340
<v Speaker 3>Why am I forgetting I'm getting old?</v>

1545
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:06.821
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1546
00:39:06.821 --> 00:39:07.450
<v Speaker 3>Chris,</v>

1547
00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:07.661
<v Speaker 3>Chris,</v>

1548
00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:09.730
<v Speaker 3>Chris Mayer was showing me like,</v>

1549
00:39:09.731 --> 00:39:12.540
<v Speaker 3>he's a boxer quality box had been around forever and fought,</v>

1550
00:39:12.541 --> 00:39:13.750
<v Speaker 3>fought or I'll Spence but got beat.</v>

1551
00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:14.943
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1552
00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1553
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.390
<v Speaker 3>a high level boxer and he was showing me,</v>

1554
00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:20.290
<v Speaker 3>he was just showing me,</v>

1555
00:39:20.291 --> 00:39:20.801
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1556
00:39:20.801 --> 00:39:22.330
<v Speaker 3>why is Errol Spence so good?</v>

1557
00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:22.960
<v Speaker 3>Because he,</v>

1558
00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:23.793
<v Speaker 3>I know he's great,</v>

1559
00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.990
<v Speaker 3>but he looks like basic,</v>

1560
00:39:25.991 --> 00:39:28.580
<v Speaker 3>like he does like jab one,</v>

1561
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.433
<v Speaker 3>two and he,</v>

1562
00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.890
<v Speaker 3>so for my eye as not a very sophisticated guy,</v>

1563
00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:33.760
<v Speaker 3>I can't see what's making them so good.</v>

1564
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:33.961
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1565
00:39:33.961 --> 00:39:34.600
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1566
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.830
<v Speaker 3>And he was showing me,</v>

1567
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.590
<v Speaker 3>it was really a yesterday just showing me how,</v>

1568
00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.110
<v Speaker 3>like he was able to measure his jab.</v>

1569
00:39:42.111 --> 00:39:43.540
<v Speaker 3>So Chris would throw a jab and he goes,</v>

1570
00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:47.710
<v Speaker 3>Watch and I throw a jab and he goes and he would move back just like his ability</v>

1571
00:39:47.711 --> 00:39:49.360
<v Speaker 3>to move back just,</v>

1572
00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:50.590
<v Speaker 3>just enough.</v>

1573
00:39:50.591 --> 00:39:53.380
<v Speaker 3>So some guys move back just a little bit too much and then went back a little</v>

1574
00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:54.161
<v Speaker 3>bit and then they throw.</v>

1575
00:39:54.161 --> 00:39:54.491
<v Speaker 3>So their,</v>

1576
00:39:54.491 --> 00:39:57.400
<v Speaker 3>their measurement of distance is just a little off and you have time to</v>

1577
00:39:57.401 --> 00:40:02.230
<v Speaker 3>compensate his ability to move back the precise amount so that you don't have</v>

1578
00:40:02.231 --> 00:40:03.310
<v Speaker 3>time to react because he comes back,</v>

1579
00:40:03.311 --> 00:40:03.551
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1580
00:40:03.551 --> 00:40:04.300
<v Speaker 3>it hits you again.</v>

1581
00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.670
<v Speaker 3>So every time you throw he would make it.</v>

1582
00:40:06.671 --> 00:40:11.050
<v Speaker 3>So his ability to sort of be just had a reach was better than anybody.</v>

1583
00:40:11.051 --> 00:40:11.531
<v Speaker 3>He had fought.</v>

1584
00:40:11.531 --> 00:40:11.681
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1585
00:40:11.681 --> 00:40:12.320
<v Speaker 3>no one's better.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know who he is.</v>

1654
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:53.780
<v Speaker 2>I know who he is and I think the world was introduced to them at that last HBO</v>

1655
00:41:53.781 --> 00:41:55.130
<v Speaker 2>card though.</v>

1656
00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:59.300
<v Speaker 2>But this is just a word I do because I saw him fight triple g fight in Montreal.</v>

1657
00:41:59.301 --> 00:42:00.990
<v Speaker 2>He's huge and they were fighting in Montreal.</v>

1658
00:42:00.991 --> 00:42:01.341
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1659
00:42:01.341 --> 00:42:02.300
<v Speaker 2>But see Billy Joe,</v>

1660
00:42:02.301 --> 00:42:03.710
<v Speaker 2>this is his first fight in America.</v>

1661
00:42:03.711 --> 00:42:04.910
<v Speaker 2>All of his fights had been in Europe.</v>

1662
00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:05.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1663
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.851
<v Speaker 2>So this is like,</v>

1664
00:42:05.851 --> 00:42:10.610
<v Speaker 2>but he's been watched a lot because he's so his flashy,</v>

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.740
<v Speaker 2>He has a mouth on him and you know what,</v>

1671
00:42:15.741 --> 00:42:20.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm the guy you can root for Jim Lampley and Roy Jones Jr had a little</v>

1672
00:42:20.211 --> 00:42:21.650
<v Speaker 2>disagreement and the commentary,</v>

1673
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.790
<v Speaker 2>oh Jim Lampley was like,</v>

1674
00:42:22.791 --> 00:42:22.881
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1675
00:42:22.881 --> 00:42:23.930
<v Speaker 2>if he's this far ahead,</v>

1676
00:42:23.931 --> 00:42:25.400
<v Speaker 2>why does he not trying to knock them out?</v>

1677
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:26.331
<v Speaker 2>Roy Jones was like,</v>

1678
00:42:26.331 --> 00:42:28.730
<v Speaker 2>why would he do you see what he's doing?</v>

1679
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:29.001
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1680
00:42:29.001 --> 00:42:30.350
<v Speaker 2>he's boxed in his face off.</v>

1681
00:42:30.351 --> 00:42:30.830
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1682
00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:34.460
<v Speaker 2>well you have the added humiliation that you do to your opponent when you knock</v>

1683
00:42:34.461 --> 00:42:34.701
<v Speaker 2>them out.</v>

1684
00:42:34.701 --> 00:42:37.180
<v Speaker 2>Like stay in your Lane Jim lamp.</v>

00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Stand in your fucking fuck.</v>

1686
00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:43.240
<v Speaker 2>It was embarrassing.</v>

1687
00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:48.560
<v Speaker 2>So you just said that to Roy Jones Jr you're talking about one of the greatest</v>

1688
00:42:48.561 --> 00:42:52.640
<v Speaker 2>knockout artists in the history of the fucking sport was telling him why someone</v>

1689
00:42:52.641 --> 00:42:53.000
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>

1690
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.860
<v Speaker 2>you don't just knock someone out.</v>

1691
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:57.860
<v Speaker 2>You have to put yourself in danger to knock someone out and you could wind up</v>

1692
00:42:57.861 --> 00:43:00.040
<v Speaker 2>losing against the fucking power puncher like Limu,</v>

1693
00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:02.570
<v Speaker 2>your life and box and you lose that fight.</v>

1694
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.553
<v Speaker 2>Everything shot,</v>

1695
00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:05.180
<v Speaker 2>the Canelo,</v>

1696
00:43:05.181 --> 00:43:05.811
<v Speaker 2>triple g fights,</v>

1697
00:43:05.811 --> 00:43:10.550
<v Speaker 2>gone fumes that place fighting a beautiful pattern for him to alter that pattern</v>

1698
00:43:10.551 --> 00:43:13.040
<v Speaker 2>to get a specific result that's not smart.</v>

1699
00:43:13.041 --> 00:43:14.060
<v Speaker 2>And it's not boxing.</v>

1700
00:43:14.061 --> 00:43:15.230
<v Speaker 2>That's not what you're supposed to do.</v>

1701
00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:15.950
<v Speaker 2>Silly.</v>

1702
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:16.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1703
00:43:16.131 --> 00:43:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Here's his highlight reel and you see,</v>

1704
00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:22.970
<v Speaker 2>see him move around him and he's so interesting with his right jab to he throws</v>

1705
00:43:22.971 --> 00:43:23.960
<v Speaker 2>punches and then he's like,</v>

1706
00:43:23.961 --> 00:43:24.231
<v Speaker 2>whoops,</v>

1707
00:43:24.231 --> 00:43:24.921
<v Speaker 2>not here anymore,</v>

1708
00:43:24.921 --> 00:43:25.360
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1709
00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.440
<v Speaker 2>I got up to the Lemieux fight.</v>

1710
00:43:27.441 --> 00:43:27.861
<v Speaker 2>If you can get,</v>

1711
00:43:27.861 --> 00:43:31.470
<v Speaker 2>that was one of the best fights because Lemieux was a legit world contender.</v>

1712
00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:32.470
<v Speaker 2>But the class,</v>

1713
00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.710
<v Speaker 2>the thing with Billy Joe Saunders,</v>

1714
00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:34.820
<v Speaker 2>if his highlights,</v>

1715
00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:36.110
<v Speaker 2>they do them justice somewhat,</v>

1716
00:43:36.111 --> 00:43:38.600
<v Speaker 2>but he always steps up to the level of competition.</v>

1717
00:43:38.601 --> 00:43:39.950
<v Speaker 2>So you might watch them against a guy like,</v>

1718
00:43:39.951 --> 00:43:40.071
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1719
00:43:40.071 --> 00:43:40.790
<v Speaker 2>it looks all right.</v>

1720
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:43.070
<v Speaker 2>But then when he Chris Eubank Junior,</v>

1721
00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:43.581
<v Speaker 2>you look at him,</v>

1722
00:43:43.581 --> 00:43:46.130
<v Speaker 2>he gets Lemieux like holy fuck this guy's world plot.</v>

1725
00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1726
00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:51.950
<v Speaker 2>That's why I think he,</v>

1727
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.480
<v Speaker 2>and he's big too for the weight class.</v>

1728
00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.540
<v Speaker 2>So a triple g or Canelo you got to fight.</v>

1729
00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.950
<v Speaker 2>He's big and he's so fucking smart,</v>

1730
00:43:57.951 --> 00:43:58.460
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1731
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:00.410
<v Speaker 2>that the big thing is how smart he is.</v>

1732
00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:00.921
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1733
00:44:00.921 --> 00:44:05.060
<v Speaker 2>his ring Iq and his ability to not get hit is so exceptional.</v>

1734
00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Steps just back and look how he changes it up.</v>

1735
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:08.571
<v Speaker 2>She goes to the head,</v>

1736
00:44:08.571 --> 00:44:09.680
<v Speaker 2>he goes to the body,</v>

1737
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.160
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1738
00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:10.730
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1739
00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:11.451
<v Speaker 2>he's an artist,</v>

1740
00:44:11.451 --> 00:44:11.691
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1741
00:44:11.691 --> 00:44:12.501
<v Speaker 2>a real artist.</v>

1742
00:44:12.501 --> 00:44:13.760
<v Speaker 2>It's really fun watching him.</v>

1743
00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:14.750
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful lefthand,</v>

1744
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:16.160
<v Speaker 2>and he has a personality.</v>

1745
00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:18.950
<v Speaker 2>Funny Spanish shit talks,</v>

1746
00:44:18.951 --> 00:44:19.550
<v Speaker 2>mad shit.</v>

1747
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:21.800
<v Speaker 2>He told Amelia some extra pants from his son.</v>

1748
00:44:21.801 --> 00:44:22.251
<v Speaker 2>They can work.</v>

1749
00:44:22.251 --> 00:44:23.084
<v Speaker 2>Just let me short.</v>

1750
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.920
<v Speaker 2>Just kept talking shit.</v>

1751
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:28.070
<v Speaker 2>And he's also best friends with fury still.</v>

1752
00:44:28.071 --> 00:44:29.330
<v Speaker 2>They're like perfect.</v>

1753
00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.870
<v Speaker 2>Baffin and rob and they're fucking man.</v>

1754
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.983
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1755
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:37.030
<v Speaker 2>I was surprised that they referred to him as a gypsy on the HBO broadcast.</v>

1756
00:44:37.031 --> 00:44:38.930
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to think it was Jim Lampley to,</v>

1757
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:40.440
<v Speaker 2>he's an older fellow.</v>

1758
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:41.940
<v Speaker 2>I thought Gypsy is a cool word,</v>

1759
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:42.774
<v Speaker 2>but I think so too.</v>

1760
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:43.710
<v Speaker 2>If you go over to London,</v>

1761
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:48.510
<v Speaker 2>they told me not to say that her Roma Roma is considered Roma is considered</v>

1762
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:50.221
<v Speaker 2>derogatory.</v>

1763
00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:50.491
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1764
00:44:50.491 --> 00:44:52.850
<v Speaker 2>So they were always just no aroma.</v>

1765
00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:57.510
<v Speaker 2>Donald Cerrone versus Yancey Madeiros UFC Austin.</v>

1766
00:44:57.630 --> 00:44:58.351
<v Speaker 2>That's a good one.</v>

1767
00:44:58.351 --> 00:45:02.190
<v Speaker 2>70 for Serone because Yancey is not a giant one 70 you know,</v>

1768
00:45:02.191 --> 00:45:02.990
<v Speaker 2>it's not like a,</v>

1769
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:04.620
<v Speaker 2>that fight of the year.</v>

1770
00:45:04.621 --> 00:45:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Some people think that was a crazy fight against cowboy early vera whole</v>

1771
00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Austin Yancy.</v>

1772
00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:13.380
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

1773
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.170
<v Speaker 2>What a fucking performance by Yancy February 18th.</v>

1774
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.863
<v Speaker 2>That's close.</v>

1775
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:18.421
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

1776
00:45:18.421 --> 00:45:18.921
<v Speaker 2>They announce it.</v>

1777
00:45:18.921 --> 00:45:19.590
<v Speaker 2>You really,</v>

1778
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:20.423
<v Speaker 2>that's really close.</v>

1779
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Real close for Yancey from that last fight.</v>

1780
00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:28.080
<v Speaker 2>The fight was a barn burner and that was only a month ago.</v>

1781
00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:28.951
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>

1782
00:45:28.951 --> 00:45:31.050
<v Speaker 2>And not much time to promote either for Austin.</v>

1783
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1784
00:45:31.561 --> 00:45:33.450
<v Speaker 2>well I don't think you need it for cowboy in Austin.</v>

1785
00:45:33.451 --> 00:45:35.670
<v Speaker 2>That mother fucker will sell out quick and it's a fight night.</v>

1786
00:45:35.671 --> 00:45:36.504
<v Speaker 2>So it's not paper.</v>

1787
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a good headline of,</v>

1788
00:45:38.161 --> 00:45:38.640
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

1789
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:42.990
<v Speaker 2>Great headline for fight night for Yancey mean he took a lot of hard shots and</v>

1790
00:45:42.991 --> 00:45:43.520
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1791
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:45.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's given him enough time to recover.</v>

1792
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.100
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make a lot of sense,</v>

1793
00:45:47.101 --> 00:45:47.731
<v Speaker 2>but if you're a dancer,</v>

1794
00:45:47.731 --> 00:45:49.020
<v Speaker 2>you're jumping at the opportunity.</v>

1795
00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:49.171
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1796
00:45:49.171 --> 00:45:49.951
<v Speaker 2>you hear a fucking,</v>

1797
00:45:49.951 --> 00:45:50.310

1798
00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:52.050

1799
00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:52.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1800
00:45:52.621 --> 00:45:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Luna Lineker got hurt.</v>

1801
00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:54.690
<v Speaker 2>And then do you see,</v>

1802
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:55.450

00:45:56.251 --> 00:46:00.720
<v Speaker 2>who to me is my dark horse and that division man fucking monster.</v>

1806
00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:01.591
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1807
00:46:01.591 --> 00:46:01.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1808
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:02.310
<v Speaker 2>he was kind of,</v>

1809
00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:04.240
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to get Murrayas right?</v>

1810
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:06.391
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1811

1812
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.560

1813
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:09.570
<v Speaker 2>you said you do that five pounds to give you five pounds,</v>

1814
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:10.623

1815
00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:11.723
<v Speaker 2>I said No.</v>

1816
00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:12.121
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes,</v>

1817
00:46:12.121 --> 00:46:13.050
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you 10 pounds.</v>

1818
00:46:13.051 --> 00:46:13.631
<v Speaker 2>I just want to fight.</v>

1819
00:46:13.631 --> 00:46:14.141
<v Speaker 2>It might not be in,</v>

1820
00:46:14.141 --> 00:46:16.320
<v Speaker 2>she still went know Marlin might not be in shape.</v>

1821
00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:18.820
<v Speaker 2>He can add them in jail.</v>

1822
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Let's fucking do it.</v>

1823
00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:20.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1824
00:46:20.281 --> 00:46:22.680
<v Speaker 2>Martin just really recently,</v>

1825
00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:26.280
<v Speaker 2>spectacular knockouts didn't get touched against aljamain sterling.</v>

1826
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:27.323
<v Speaker 2>And he's,</v>

1827
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1828
00:46:27.721 --> 00:46:31.470
<v Speaker 2>he's in that position where he's climbing the ladder to and to take a short</v>

1829
00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.880
<v Speaker 2>notice fight mark.</v>

1830
00:46:32.881 --> 00:46:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Henry's very wise in that regard.</v>

1831
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:35.401
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1832
00:46:35.401 --> 00:46:35.720
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1833
00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.020
<v Speaker 2>you talk to any coaches in the world.</v>

1834
00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:37.943
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

1835
00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:39.270
<v Speaker 2>You can beat this guy,</v>

1836
00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.100
<v Speaker 2>but do you beat this guy this way?</v>

1837
00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:41.850
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

1838
00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:44.760
<v Speaker 2>but do you beat this guy when you have a long training camp?</v>

1839
00:46:44.761 --> 00:46:45.660
<v Speaker 2>Much better odds,</v>

1840
00:46:45.661 --> 00:46:46.500
<v Speaker 2>and that's the way to do it.</v>

1841
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.430
<v Speaker 2>To really show who you really are.</v>

1842
00:46:47.431 --> 00:46:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I agree 100% I wouldn't have done it if,</v>

1843
00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.150
<v Speaker 2>if I'm mark or I'm telling my fight or not to do.</v>

1844
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:52.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a pro sport,</v>

1845
00:46:52.381 --> 00:46:52.890
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1846
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:53.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a pro sport.</v>

1847
00:46:53.761 --> 00:46:57.350
<v Speaker 2>You have to weigh these short term opportunities like Michael Bisping got when</v>

1848
00:46:57.351 --> 00:46:57.500
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1849
00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:58.980
<v Speaker 2>when he stepped up to fight Luke Rockhold.</v>

1850
00:46:58.981 --> 00:46:59.850
<v Speaker 2>You've got to weigh those.</v>

1851
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1852
00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:00.571
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1853
00:47:00.571 --> 00:47:03.900
<v Speaker 2>Bisping it fucking paid off and it paid off in spades,</v>

1854
00:47:03.901 --> 00:47:04.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1855
00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:04.910
<v Speaker 2>He chaos.</v>

1856
00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:06.450
<v Speaker 2>Rockhold it becomes a middleweight champion.</v>

1857
00:47:06.451 --> 00:47:09.270
<v Speaker 2>The worlds of fills a lifetime dream all on 11 days.</v>

1858
00:47:09.271 --> 00:47:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Notice to the fucking man has cast iron bowling balls hanging from his dick like</v>

1859
00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:15.060
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

1860
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:16.800
<v Speaker 2>He's the best deny that about my thing.</v>

1861
00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:17.580
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>

1862
00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.960
<v Speaker 2>but then the same thing,</v>

1863
00:47:18.961 --> 00:47:22.320
<v Speaker 2>that same mentality as to bites him in the ass and he goes and fights Calvin</v>

1864
00:47:22.321 --> 00:47:25.820
<v Speaker 2>gassed alum just a few days after fighting a fucking crazy.</v>

1865
00:47:25.821 --> 00:47:28.050
<v Speaker 2>You fight with George Saint Pierre and he doesn't look good.</v>

1866
00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:28.930
<v Speaker 2>He looked horrible.</v>

1867
00:47:28.930 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Then look at Machida.</v>

1868
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.940
<v Speaker 1>He just got starched and now he's headlining and where the fuck they're did</v>

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:40.690
<v Speaker 1>you've got starts and then any tested positive blue Machida's last fight.</v>

1871
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Machida tested positive for his last,</v>

1872
00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:48.180
<v Speaker 1>his last fight Machita Machita was suspended for something for Derek Brunson.</v>

1873
00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1874
00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:53.550

1875
00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Pretty sure two years crazy.</v>

1876
00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:55.481
<v Speaker 1>They fight.</v>

1877
00:47:55.481 --> 00:47:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Derek Brunson got starched,</v>

1878
00:47:57.071 --> 00:47:57.290
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1879
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.541

1882
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:02.950

1883
00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:05.170
<v Speaker 1>And then I heard he was talked into it.</v>

1884
00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.610
<v Speaker 1>And then who's he fighting?</v>

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.380
<v Speaker 1>But something about losing to a chicken pool.</v>

1991
00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.270

00:51:09.111 --> 00:51:09.830
<v Speaker 1>he'd play,</v>

2008
00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I played chess with him and he was,</v>

2009
00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:13.730
<v Speaker 1>I used to play with my dad is,</v>

2010
00:51:13.731 --> 00:51:16.190
<v Speaker 1>and he's beating me so quickly and I was like,</v>

2011
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:17.540
<v Speaker 1>what are you,</v>

2012
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:18.360
<v Speaker 1>why are you so good?</v>

2013
00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:18.860
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2014
00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:19.011
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2015
00:51:19.011 --> 00:51:19.311
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2016
00:51:19.311 --> 00:51:19.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2017
00:51:19.491 --> 00:51:20.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm just playing.</v>

2018
00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:20.630
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2019
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:21.463
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

2020
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:22.610
<v Speaker 1>I'll have you read books on chess.</v>

2021
00:51:22.611 --> 00:51:23.444
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2022
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:25.970
<v Speaker 1>of course I went,</v>

2023
00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.080
<v Speaker 1>oh well it's his thing</v>

2024
00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:29.661
<v Speaker 1>and I played pool.</v>

2025
00:51:29.661 --> 00:51:30.670
<v Speaker 1>He beat everybody at pulled.</v>

2026
00:51:30.671 --> 00:51:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Then we play paint might be everything.</v>

2027
00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:33.520
<v Speaker 1>There's some things in the game guys.</v>

2028
00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Guys just good at everything he's,</v>

2029
00:51:34.671 --> 00:51:35.240
<v Speaker 1>he's got,</v>

2030
00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:38.060
<v Speaker 1>he's got game theory like he noticed what Mack Ping Pong.</v>

2031
00:51:38.061 --> 00:51:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I pride myself on my pink button.</v>

2032
00:51:39.381 --> 00:51:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good but I think I am and I'll talk a big game.</v>

2033
00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:46.280
<v Speaker 1>He noticed that my fucking that my backhand over here,</v>

2034
00:51:46.281 --> 00:51:47.360
<v Speaker 1>it's a little suspect.</v>

2035
00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:48.880
<v Speaker 1>So of course he just saw whole,</v>

2036
00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:51.450
<v Speaker 1>am I getting those people that can see a hole there strategically?</v>

2037
00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like you played Rozzie k fucking hole in his game,</v>

2038
00:51:54.021 --> 00:51:55.250
<v Speaker 1>but that get that.</v>

2039
00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:56.810
<v Speaker 1>I was like this play a lot of games.</v>

2040
00:51:56.811 --> 00:51:57.620
<v Speaker 1>Does he yell it?</v>

2041
00:51:57.620 --> 00:51:58.850
<v Speaker 1>If I saw a whole new game,</v>

2042
00:51:58.851 --> 00:52:00.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that cause I want to play the game.</v>

2043
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:03.510
<v Speaker 1>What we had laid makes the voice of our,</v>

2044
00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:04.070
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>

2045
00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:04.700
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

2046
00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:06.200
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't try to win.</v>

2047
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:06.561
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2048
00:52:06.561 --> 00:52:07.151
<v Speaker 1>Depending on,</v>

2049
00:52:07.151 --> 00:52:08.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck about winning.</v>

2050
00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck about beating you.</v>

2051
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Find out the guys get a shitty half guard.</v>

2052
00:52:11.601 --> 00:52:14.090
<v Speaker 1>You tell him you don't go towards his half guard all the time when I street</v>

2053
00:52:14.091 --> 00:52:14.361
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

2054
00:52:14.361 --> 00:52:14.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2055
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:15.441
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>

2056
00:52:15.441 --> 00:52:16.101
<v Speaker 1>when I straight out,</v>

2057
00:52:16.101 --> 00:52:17.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going into his half guts.</v>

2058
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Piss on your hips.</v>

2059
00:52:21.951 --> 00:52:22.784
<v Speaker 1>At least limit,</v>

2060
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.600
<v Speaker 1>bring it out.</v>

2061
00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Let me go.</v>

2062
00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:26.210
<v Speaker 1>And I taught street fight and might come back.</v>

2063
00:52:26.211 --> 00:52:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Stay out of your medium sized street fighting.</v>

2064
00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:29.721
<v Speaker 1>When I come back,</v>

2065
00:52:29.721 --> 00:52:31.040
<v Speaker 1>don't fucking shut the fuck.</v>

2066
00:52:31.041 --> 00:52:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Don't talk about street fighting with me,</v>

2067
00:52:32.331 --> 00:52:32.541
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

2068
00:52:32.541 --> 00:52:33.430
<v Speaker 1>I take it very serious.</v>

2069
00:52:33.431 --> 00:52:35.540
<v Speaker 1>So Watson with Wayne and your friends and then when I come back,</v>

2070
00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:36.471
<v Speaker 1>shut the fucking,</v>

2071
00:52:36.471 --> 00:52:37.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm a boxer and I,</v>

2072
00:52:37.531 --> 00:52:38.060
<v Speaker 1>and I rethink,</v>

2073
00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:39.170
<v Speaker 1>you get hit too much in the head.</v>

2074
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:41.350
<v Speaker 1>As an older guy who does power lifting,</v>

2075
00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:46.730
<v Speaker 1>did you see that new thing where they said that they train AI to play chess?</v>

2076
00:52:46.731 --> 00:52:49.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a new AI program and um,</v>

2077
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.610
<v Speaker 1>not only did it beat some world chess master,</v>

2078
00:52:52.611 --> 00:52:53.030
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2079
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.840
<v Speaker 1>I just tweeted it,</v>

2080
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:54.860
<v Speaker 1>see if you could pull that shit up.</v>

2081
00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:55.820
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2082
00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:56.151
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2083
00:52:56.151 --> 00:52:57.230
<v Speaker 1>it is from the Daily Mail,</v>

2084
00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:57.990
<v Speaker 1>which you got to go.</v>

2085
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2086
00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:00.130
<v Speaker 1>There might be exaggerating a little bit.</v>

2087
00:53:00.131 --> 00:53:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2088
00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.153
<v Speaker 1>But it said that the,</v>

2089
00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:05.720
<v Speaker 1>that this chess computer had invented a series of moves that no one had ever</v>

2090
00:53:05.721 --> 00:53:06.554
<v Speaker 1>seen before.</v>

2091
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:07.800
<v Speaker 1>So it's scary.</v>

2092
00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:09.080
<v Speaker 1>It's being creative.</v>

2093
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:10.340
<v Speaker 1>It did a move.</v>

2094
00:53:10.341 --> 00:53:12.770
<v Speaker 1>It did like a pattern that no one had seen before.</v>

2095
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:15.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's figuring out how to play on the job.</v>

2096
00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:17.250
<v Speaker 1>This is whole movement out.</v>

2097
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:18.260
<v Speaker 1>People are writing books on my,</v>

2098
00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:21.290
<v Speaker 1>on how to deal with the second smart machine agent in four hours.</v>

2099
00:53:21.291 --> 00:53:24.380
<v Speaker 1>A robot taught itself chest and beat a grand master with moves.</v>

2100
00:53:24.381 --> 00:53:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Never devised the games.</v>

2101
00:53:25.651 --> 00:53:27.150
<v Speaker 1>1500 year history.</v>

2102
00:53:27.151 --> 00:53:28.680
<v Speaker 1>And the implications are terrifying.</v>

2103
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:30.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2104
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:30.991
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2105
00:53:30.991 --> 00:53:35.991
<v Speaker 1>And so what that the more terrifying thing besides is the fact that massive,</v>

2106
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:40.440
<v Speaker 1>massive sections of our job markets are going away.</v>

2107
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2108
00:53:40.711 --> 00:53:41.081
<v Speaker 1>Look at what a,</v>

2109
00:53:41.081 --> 00:53:41.914
<v Speaker 1>what do we do?</v>

2110
00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Oxford academic AI could go rogue and become too complex for engineers.</v>

2111
00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2112
00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2113
00:53:52.650 --> 00:53:53.483
<v Speaker 1>That is it.</v>

2114
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:54.091
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2115
00:53:54.091 --> 00:53:56.100
<v Speaker 1>what are your thoughts on net neutrality?</v>

2116
00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:59.880
<v Speaker 1>Because I would talking to people online today about net neutrality.</v>

2117
00:53:59.881 --> 00:54:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2118
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I posted something about it that it seems to me to be one of those ideological</v>

2119
00:54:04.171 --> 00:54:07.440
<v Speaker 1>camp issues where if you are leaning right,</v>

2120
00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:10.800
<v Speaker 1>you think that net neutrality is a bad thing that the market should decide.</v>

2121
00:54:10.801 --> 00:54:11.880
<v Speaker 1>If you're leaning left,</v>

2122
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:15.720
<v Speaker 1>you think that there's some regulation that the government should step in and be</v>

2123
00:54:15.721 --> 00:54:18.450
<v Speaker 1>important because you want to keep people from information.</v>

2124
00:54:18.451 --> 00:54:22.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to a big corporation to be able to step in and say someone can or</v>

2125
00:54:22.741 --> 00:54:23.560
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>

2126
00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:23.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2127
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:27.090
<v Speaker 1>have their program on 18 t or Verizon or,</v>

2128
00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I think that from what I've read,</v>

2129
00:54:29.581 --> 00:54:32.400
<v Speaker 1>there are six major service providers.</v>

2130
00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

2131
00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:37.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe a couple more that that already smelled a little bit like a monopoly,</v>

2132
00:54:37.771 --> 00:54:40.440
<v Speaker 1>but what I think is that if you,</v>

2133
00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:41.310
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2134
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:42.540
<v Speaker 1>nobody really knows yet,</v>

2135
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:47.870
<v Speaker 1>but I think that the bigger issue becomes if these companies provide you service</v>

2136
00:54:48.991 --> 00:54:50.010
<v Speaker 1>in your area,</v>

2137
00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:54.210
<v Speaker 1>they could decide to break it into say to bandwidth,</v>

2138
00:54:54.211 --> 00:54:55.920
<v Speaker 1>say could decide you want regular,</v>

2139
00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:58.620
<v Speaker 1>you want regular service or do you want premium?</v>

2140
00:54:58.620 --> 00:54:59.281
<v Speaker 1>If you want premium,</v>

2141
00:54:59.281 --> 00:55:01.150
<v Speaker 1>we're going to pay a little more good.</v>

2142
00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:01.741
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>

2143
00:55:01.741 --> 00:55:02.550
<v Speaker 1>They could bring it up.</v>

2144
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:03.780
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case,</v>

2145
00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:05.460
<v Speaker 1>we'll let the market decide.</v>

2146
00:55:05.461 --> 00:55:10.380
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that maybe that creates an opening for another service provider to come in</v>

2147
00:55:10.381 --> 00:55:10.741
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

2148
00:55:10.741 --> 00:55:13.520
<v Speaker 1>we don't do that one price covers everything.</v>

2149
00:55:13.521 --> 00:55:16.440
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the guys on my Instagram or my Twitter rather had a really good</v>

2150
00:55:16.441 --> 00:55:16.920
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

2151
00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:20.400
<v Speaker 1>He said the real issue that people aren't talking about is the monopolies that</v>

2152
00:55:20.401 --> 00:55:21.990
<v Speaker 1>these companies have in small areas.</v>

2153
00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2154
00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're in a certain town,</v>

2155
00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:25.870
<v Speaker 1>like you can only get this kind of company or you know,</v>

2156
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:26.783
<v Speaker 1>Verizon or,</v>

2157
00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:27.813
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying,</v>

2158
00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:31.770
<v Speaker 1>when you have a company that owns a certain town and then you know,</v>

2159
00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:33.800
<v Speaker 1>in certain areas is the only way you can get coverage.</v>

2160
00:55:33.801 --> 00:55:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to do with this one company,</v>

2161
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:36.510
<v Speaker 1>then then it becomes a real issue.</v>

2162
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:37.590
<v Speaker 1>And not only does it become an issue,</v>

2163
00:55:37.591 --> 00:55:42.450
<v Speaker 1>but the other issue is that now the real question is if you are a service</v>

2164
00:55:42.451 --> 00:55:44.490
<v Speaker 1>provider and you provide,</v>

2165
00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:44.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2166
00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:46.020
<v Speaker 1>people in this area,</v>

2167
00:55:46.021 --> 00:55:46.854
<v Speaker 1>that service,</v>

2168
00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:48.870
<v Speaker 1>if the other service has,</v>

2169
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:53.950
<v Speaker 1>if you use platforms that the other service provides and they compete directly</v>

2170
00:55:53.971 --> 00:55:54.301
<v Speaker 1>with this,</v>

2171
00:55:54.301 --> 00:55:58.320
<v Speaker 1>with this service block that would this service have an incentive to,</v>

2172
00:55:58.620 --> 00:55:59.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2173
00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:01.380
<v Speaker 1>slow block your access to it or whatever.</v>

2174
00:56:01.381 --> 00:56:02.430
<v Speaker 1>And that would be an issue.</v>

2175
00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:07.790
<v Speaker 1>But my feeling is that we'll find out very quickly and as long as consumers have</v>

2176
00:56:08.431 --> 00:56:11.070
<v Speaker 1>the ability to go over to another provider,</v>

2177
00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:13.560
<v Speaker 1>as long as consumers have the ability to go,</v>

2178
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:15.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the way you do business,</v>

2179
00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:16.051
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

2180
00:56:16.051 --> 00:56:18.690
<v Speaker 1>but they don't got a lot of areas becomes the</v>

2181
00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.730
<v Speaker 1>terrorists have a license,</v>

2182
00:56:21.731 --> 00:56:23.060
<v Speaker 1>they have a license and a certain,</v>

2183
00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:23.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2184
00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Certain district consumer backlash is how you fight that.</v>

2185
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.420
<v Speaker 1>If there's enough consumer backlash and people go,</v>

2186
00:56:29.421 --> 00:56:32.020
<v Speaker 1>are you just keep the net neutrality in place and prevent it,</v>

2187
00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:32.630
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2188
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2189
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:33.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2190
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:36.940
<v Speaker 1>it's just I'm going to have some experts on to talk about it soon in the future.</v>

2191
00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:39.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm going over all the data and information,</v>

2192
00:56:39.011 --> 00:56:43.200
<v Speaker 1>but I just wanted to get people's temperature and it's so funny how people,</v>

2193
00:56:43.201 --> 00:56:43.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2194
00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:47.380
<v Speaker 1>get so aggressive and shitty with you when you just talk about this issue</v>

2195
00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.120
<v Speaker 1>because a few people that have had a mute,</v>

2196
00:56:49.121 --> 00:56:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2197
00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:50.763
<v Speaker 1>good luck dude.</v>

2198
00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Your opinion means shit to me because you just have to be insulting when</v>

2199
00:56:54.041 --> 00:56:55.270
<v Speaker 1>someone's just asking a question.</v>

2200
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2201
00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:56.291
<v Speaker 1>You know this,</v>

2202
00:56:56.291 --> 00:57:00.250
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing is interesting because there's smart people on both sides of it</v>

2203
00:57:00.251 --> 00:57:03.130
<v Speaker 1>and they have compelling arguments on both sides of it and I don't,</v>

2204
00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:06.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't have an opinion 100% I leaned more towards Paul.</v>

2205
00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:11.210
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't yet know how this this is going to play out because you</v>

2206
00:57:11.211 --> 00:57:11.490
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2207
00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:12.251
<v Speaker 1>you may say though,</v>

2208
00:57:12.251 --> 00:57:17.251
<v Speaker 1>you lean towards what I lean towards the idea that you have to have some</v>

2209
00:57:17.501 --> 00:57:18.334
<v Speaker 1>oversight,</v>

2210
00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:22.390
<v Speaker 1>that you have to have someone who's looking out who makes sure that these</v>

2211
00:57:22.391 --> 00:57:26.200
<v Speaker 1>companies can't fuck you over and can't prevent you from having access to</v>

2212
00:57:26.201 --> 00:57:27.040
<v Speaker 1>certain information.</v>

2213
00:57:27.041 --> 00:57:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Certain sites I lean towards that most.</v>

2214
00:57:29.351 --> 00:57:30.640
<v Speaker 1>But the answer that,</v>

2215
00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:34.240
<v Speaker 1>the other question is though that does the market decide that was going to say</v>

2216
00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.040
<v Speaker 1>the other oversight could be,</v>

2217
00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I always leaned toward the idea that the marketplace would be your oversight.</v>

2218
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Let people make their choice,</v>

2219
00:57:42.191 --> 00:57:43.390
<v Speaker 1>but they have to have a choice.</v>

2220
00:57:43.391 --> 00:57:47.050
<v Speaker 1>Unless you were talking about there are very few service providers might.</v>

2221
00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.130
<v Speaker 1>My question is,</v>

2222
00:57:48.131 --> 00:57:51.850
<v Speaker 1>is there incentive for other people to come into the service providing space?</v>

2223
00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Can they make money?</v>

2224
00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2225
00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:56.160
<v Speaker 1>what are the barriers to entry and as far as the right.</v>

2226
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:57.460
<v Speaker 1>And secondly,</v>

2227
00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:58.130
<v Speaker 1>secondly,</v>

2228
00:57:58.130 --> 00:57:58.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2229
00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:03.750
<v Speaker 1>is it in these service providers interest ultimately to make extra cash for such</v>

2230
00:58:04.211 --> 00:58:05.044
<v Speaker 1>bad press?</v>

2231
00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:05.651
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2232
00:58:05.651 --> 00:58:08.620
<v Speaker 1>you may see nothing happened as a result,</v>

2233
00:58:08.621 --> 00:58:10.850
<v Speaker 1>but I liked the idea that the marketplace that,</v>

2234
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:14.230
<v Speaker 1>that consumers have a choice and when consumers have a choice,</v>

2235
00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.430
<v Speaker 1>they're going to go with what works the best for group B.</v>

2236
00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:17.410
<v Speaker 1>I do too.</v>

2237
00:58:17.411 --> 00:58:21.340
<v Speaker 1>But I do believe that it's entirely possible that large corporations could have</v>

2238
00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:26.230
<v Speaker 1>monopoly real influence over the way our culture has access to information.</v>

2239
00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:28.210
<v Speaker 1>I think I agree that should be stopped.</v>

2240
00:58:28.211 --> 00:58:32.470
<v Speaker 1>But I also think that these fucking government organizations almost all suck.</v>

2241
00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:36.780
<v Speaker 1>They're all filled with unmotivated people who suck at their job and the</v>

2242
00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:40.450
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy and the fucking red tape gets deeper and thicker.</v>

2243
00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:45.220
<v Speaker 1>I think almost every government organization that does any task is flawed.</v>

2244
00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:49.300
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that we should have government take care of these issues.</v>

2245
00:58:49.390 --> 00:58:50.470
<v Speaker 1>I have a problem with that too.</v>

2246
00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Missy both sides of it.</v>

2247
00:58:51.790 --> 00:58:52.840
<v Speaker 1>I see this side too.</v>

2248
00:58:52.841 --> 00:58:55.210
<v Speaker 1>There's another dark side of the marketplace though I,</v>

2249
00:58:55.211 --> 00:58:55.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2250
00:58:55.571 --> 00:58:57.820
<v Speaker 1>I think the news nowadays,</v>

2251
00:58:57.970 --> 00:58:58.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2252
00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:00.540
<v Speaker 1>makes a lot of money on clickbait and,</v>

2253
00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:01.540
<v Speaker 1>and so you,</v>

2254
00:59:01.541 --> 00:59:03.160
<v Speaker 1>you now have companies,</v>

2255
00:59:03.161 --> 00:59:07.930
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the Huffington Post or CNN or whatever who are less interested,</v>

2256
00:59:07.931 --> 00:59:08.441
<v Speaker 1>it seems,</v>

2257
00:59:08.441 --> 00:59:12.910
<v Speaker 1>and objective reporting of the news and way more interested in generating</v>

2258
00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:13.960
<v Speaker 1>clicks.</v>

2259
00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.120
<v Speaker 1>Did you seal fucking Newsweek,</v>

2260
00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:17.191
<v Speaker 1>title the,</v>

2261
00:59:17.191 --> 00:59:21.350
<v Speaker 1>that they put out about Trump and the Nazis like stealing Christmas?</v>

2262
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:22.541
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that?</v>

2263
00:59:22.541 --> 00:59:23.030
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

2264
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.721
<v Speaker 2>That's a classic.</v>

2265
00:59:23.721 --> 00:59:24.650
<v Speaker 2>See if you can find it.</v>

2266
00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:25.280
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

2267
00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:26.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm already intrigued.</v>

2268
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:27.930
<v Speaker 2>You know the news,</v>

2269
00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:32.050
<v Speaker 2>the world is such a polygamy infotainment,</v>

2270
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:32.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2271
00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:33.410
<v Speaker 2>That's a tragedy.</v>

2272
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Newsweek,</v>

2273
00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:35.300
<v Speaker 2>which will,</v>

2274
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:37.010
<v Speaker 2>you would always say they have to compete.</v>

2275
00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:37.940
<v Speaker 2>There are met.</v>

2276
00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:38.750
<v Speaker 2>They have to compete.</v>

2277
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:39.321
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

2278
00:59:39.321 --> 00:59:39.840
<v Speaker 2>You have to can be,</v>

2279
00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:41.270
<v Speaker 2>but you'd always think they're measured.</v>

2280
00:59:41.271 --> 00:59:42.050
<v Speaker 2>They're intelligent.</v>

2281
00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:44.600
<v Speaker 2>This is Newsweek disrespected when,</v>

2282
00:59:44.601 --> 00:59:45.700
<v Speaker 2>when Chris Rock the DEP,</v>

2283
00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:50.150
<v Speaker 2>when Chris was working on a bit how Trump and the Nazi stole Christmas to</v>

2284
00:59:50.151 --> 00:59:51.410
<v Speaker 2>promote white nationalism.</v>

2285
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2286
00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:54.380
<v Speaker 2>fucking slow down.</v>

2287
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:55.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2288
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:56.610
<v Speaker 2>This is just his hair.</v>

2289
00:59:56.670 --> 00:59:59.300
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get Caitlyn Jenner elected president.</v>

2290
00:59:59.301 --> 01:00:00.200
<v Speaker 2>If you keep this shit up.</v>

2291
01:00:00.201 --> 01:00:00.490
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2292
01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:02.270
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to understand what's happening here.</v>

2293
01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.440
<v Speaker 2>People are gonna go nuts.</v>

2294
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:07.670
<v Speaker 2>The media's disapproval rating the opposite according to some halls,</v>

2295
01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:08.031
<v Speaker 2>the media,</v>

2296
01:00:08.031 --> 01:00:11.030
<v Speaker 2>his approval rating is in the single digits and I think they deserve it.</v>

2297
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:12.343
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

2298
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:14.030
<v Speaker 2>I um,</v>

2299
01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.940
<v Speaker 2>am not nearly as cynical as a lot of people,</v>

2300
01:00:16.941 --> 01:00:19.340
<v Speaker 2>but as I get older and I see how her responsible,</v>

2301
01:00:19.341 --> 01:00:22.370
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the news is how much money there is to be made by just,</v>

2302
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:26.180
<v Speaker 2>just hinting or sort of,</v>

2303
01:00:26.181 --> 01:00:26.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2304
01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:31.120
<v Speaker 2>associating somebodies name with something kind of volatile short</v>

2305
01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:33.873
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

2306
01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:35.780
<v Speaker 2>A lot of their environment,</v>

2307
01:00:35.781 --> 01:00:37.560
<v Speaker 2>like they're dealing with what gets a response.</v>

2308
01:00:37.561 --> 01:00:38.630
<v Speaker 2>And when it gets clicks,</v>

2309
01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:39.790
<v Speaker 2>so all good questions.</v>

2310
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Societies are the ones who are telling them to do this.</v>

2311
01:00:42.111 --> 01:00:43.420
<v Speaker 2>They're not just making this shit up.</v>

2312
01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:44.030
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2313
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.480
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2314
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:44.661
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2315
01:00:44.661 --> 01:00:45.110
<v Speaker 2>if we,</v>

2316
01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:45.950
<v Speaker 2>if we say Trump,</v>

2317
01:00:45.951 --> 01:00:47.270
<v Speaker 2>the Nazi stole Christmas,</v>

2318
01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:48.570
<v Speaker 2>how many clicks are we going to get?</v>

2319
01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:49.011
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2320
01:00:49.011 --> 01:00:51.500
<v Speaker 2>but this is what they're doing is they're being more exclusive.</v>

2321
01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:51.891
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

2322
01:00:51.891 --> 01:00:53.600
<v Speaker 2>They're being disingenuous here in this article.</v>

2323
01:00:53.601 --> 01:00:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Scroll up a little bit because here's one of the things it says.</v>

2324
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:57.560
<v Speaker 2>It says,</v>

2325
01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump wants America to thank,</v>

2326
01:00:59.601 --> 01:01:01.220
<v Speaker 2>he reinvented Christmas.</v>

2327
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:03.410
<v Speaker 2>We can say merry Christmas again.</v>

2328
01:01:03.411 --> 01:01:04.610
<v Speaker 2>He has said on numerous occasions,</v>

2329
01:01:04.611 --> 01:01:06.380
<v Speaker 2>both during the campaign and president and presidency,</v>

2330
01:01:06.381 --> 01:01:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Christmases back better than ever before.</v>

2331
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:10.550
<v Speaker 2>He told supporters month before the Christmas season,</v>

2332
01:01:10.551 --> 01:01:15.551
<v Speaker 2>fuck he is doing what a guy who's very persuasive does to try to get people in</v>

2333
01:01:16.221 --> 01:01:16.881
<v Speaker 2>his camp.</v>

2334
01:01:16.881 --> 01:01:17.541
<v Speaker 2>He's a falcon.</v>

2335
01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:19.190
<v Speaker 2>Politicians got a sense of humor,</v>

2336
01:01:19.191 --> 01:01:20.300
<v Speaker 2>but it's not even true.</v>

2337
01:01:20.301 --> 01:01:20.760
<v Speaker 2>But the what,</v>

2338
01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.141
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

2339
01:01:21.141 --> 01:01:25.160
<v Speaker 2>what he's doing here is not even true because he in the past did a lot of tweets</v>

2340
01:01:25.161 --> 01:01:26.750
<v Speaker 2>about happy holidays.</v>

2341
01:01:26.751 --> 01:01:27.051
<v Speaker 2>Happy.</v>

2342
01:01:27.051 --> 01:01:31.190
<v Speaker 2>I like people pulled them up that he used to say happy holidays all the time,</v>

2343
01:01:31.191 --> 01:01:36.191
<v Speaker 2>like really recently was tweeting happy holidays and then the idea that Obama</v>

2344
01:01:36.381 --> 01:01:38.700
<v Speaker 2>never said merry Christmas is 100% horseshit.</v>

2345
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:41.780
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole video of Obama saying merry Christmas.</v>

2346
01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Merry Christmas is over and over again.</v>

2347
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:45.043
<v Speaker 2>Nothing wrong with it.</v>

2348
01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:48.050
<v Speaker 2>This idea is he's trying to sell people on the idea that you will,</v>

2349
01:01:48.110 --> 01:01:53.110
<v Speaker 2>your Christian values have been suppressed by this mediocre left wing government</v>

2350
01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.730
<v Speaker 2>and he stepping in here to make America great again.</v>

2351
01:01:55.731 --> 01:01:56.564
<v Speaker 2>It's all a hustle,</v>

2352
01:01:56.930 --> 01:02:01.370
<v Speaker 2>but it's not white nationalists and Nazis like you can't say Nazis.</v>

2353
01:02:01.371 --> 01:02:06.371
<v Speaker 2>The problem is when you say that you leave the word Nazi loses its fucking</v>

2354
01:02:06.411 --> 01:02:06.890
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

2355
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2356
01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.660
<v Speaker 2>They're irresponsible journalists.</v>

2357
01:02:08.661 --> 01:02:09.411
<v Speaker 2>They're not journalists.</v>

2358
01:02:09.411 --> 01:02:10.400
<v Speaker 2>They're irresponsible.</v>

2359
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2360
01:02:10.581 --> 01:02:14.150
<v Speaker 2>What he's doing is he's being a fucking politician.</v>

2361
01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:15.200
<v Speaker 2>He's being a weasel.</v>

2362
01:02:15.350 --> 01:02:17.570
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to pretend that Christmas was never,</v>

2363
01:02:17.571 --> 01:02:17.871
<v Speaker 2>we never,</v>

2364
01:02:17.871 --> 01:02:18.980
<v Speaker 2>we never had Christmas before.</v>

2365
01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:20.910
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have Christmas now and all the dopes,</v>

2366
01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:21.753
<v Speaker 2>all the yokels,</v>

2367
01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:22.913
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2368
01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:25.863
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2369
01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:27.990
<v Speaker 2>this guy's out there with make America great again.</v>

2370
01:02:27.991 --> 01:02:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Tattoos.</v>

2371
01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:29.730
<v Speaker 2>You just understand this.</v>

2372
01:02:29.731 --> 01:02:30.390
<v Speaker 2>This is real.</v>

2373
01:02:30.390 --> 01:02:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Like there's people with its red hat,</v>

2374
01:02:31.921 --> 01:02:35.820
<v Speaker 2>tattoos that say make America great again on there's dummies in every fucking</v>

2375
01:02:35.821 --> 01:02:36.720
<v Speaker 2>quadrant in this earth.</v>

2376
01:02:36.721 --> 01:02:37.554
<v Speaker 2>But do you know,</v>

2377
01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:38.680
<v Speaker 2>I have to say that the,</v>

2378
01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:40.470
<v Speaker 2>the mainstream media,</v>

2379
01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:41.670
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

2380
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I know I had never been a fan of Trump,</v>

2381
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:47.070
<v Speaker 2>but the way they treat him with this kind of stuff that I constantly hear this</v>

2382
01:02:47.071 --> 01:02:47.851
<v Speaker 2>petty shit.</v>

2383
01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:49.050
<v Speaker 2>The way it drinks water and stuff.</v>

2384
01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:50.790
<v Speaker 2>It's made me funny.</v>

2385
01:02:50.791 --> 01:02:52.320
<v Speaker 2>That made me more sympathetic.</v>

2386
01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.120
<v Speaker 2>When you drink water,</v>

2387
01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:55.703
<v Speaker 2>drink water like this.</v>

2388
01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:59.300
<v Speaker 2>I got a strange guy,</v>

2389
01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:00.643
<v Speaker 2>12 guys.</v>

2390
01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:02.971
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking,</v>

2391
01:03:02.971 --> 01:03:06.600
<v Speaker 2>when you drink 12 diet cokes might be true or I don't believe it.</v>

2392
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:07.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2393
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:08.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to believe anymore.</v>

2394
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:08.910
<v Speaker 2>That's the other problem.</v>

2395
01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:12.840
<v Speaker 2>There's another bunch of it cause he quotes a series of quotes from him from</v>

2396
01:03:12.841 --> 01:03:13.950
<v Speaker 2>back in the day saying,</v>

2397
01:03:13.951 --> 01:03:16.020
<v Speaker 2>why would you drink that coke to drink diet coke?</v>

2398
01:03:16.021 --> 01:03:18.630
<v Speaker 2>People drink diet coke or all saw fat diet coke makes you fat.</v>

2399
01:03:18.631 --> 01:03:19.464
<v Speaker 2>It's been proven.</v>

2400
01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:20.730
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole series of tweets.</v>

2401
01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Like he might've just forgot he made those tweets while he strapped.</v>

2402
01:03:23.281 --> 01:03:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Just doesn't give a fuck in great shape.</v>

2403
01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:26.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2404
01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:26.940
<v Speaker 2>But I think that,</v>

2405
01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:27.863
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2406
01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:28.793
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

2407
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.940
<v Speaker 2>he as a president,</v>

2408
01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:30.930
<v Speaker 2>here's a weird one,</v>

2409
01:03:31.020 --> 01:03:34.260
<v Speaker 2>there was a terror attack that was thwarted by the FBI in San Francisco.</v>

2410
01:03:34.261 --> 01:03:37.950
<v Speaker 2>You didn't hear a Goddamn peep about it because he's against the FBI because of</v>

2411
01:03:37.951 --> 01:03:38.101
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2412
01:03:38.101 --> 01:03:39.630
<v Speaker 2>all this investigation shit.</v>

2413
01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.610
<v Speaker 2>So the president in the United States didn't,</v>

2414
01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:44.310
<v Speaker 2>it didn't like congratulate the FBI,</v>

2415
01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:47.010
<v Speaker 2>didn't tell the American people that the FBI had done a great job.</v>

2416
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.740
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2417
01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:49.800
<v Speaker 2>I know about the terrorist attack.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You want to stop the terrorists.</v>

2423
01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:58.710
<v Speaker 2>He is a political point.</v>

2424
01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:04.100
<v Speaker 2>He avoided this terrible and he arrests man suspected applauding isis inspired</v>

2425
01:04:06.661 --> 01:04:11.490
<v Speaker 2>Christmas terror attack in San Francisco and everyone at times it was a marine</v>

2428
01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:13.710
<v Speaker 2>started going crazy.</v>

2429
01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2430
01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:14.491
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2431
01:04:14.491 --> 01:04:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Well it's just very handy.</v>

2432
01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:18.000
<v Speaker 2>It's very crazy arguments.</v>

2433
01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.490
<v Speaker 2>And how about he started,</v>

2434
01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:19.860
<v Speaker 2>they give,</v>

2435
01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:20.220
<v Speaker 2>they come,</v>

2436
01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:21.001
<v Speaker 2>he started to like,</v>

2437
01:04:21.001 --> 01:04:24.990
<v Speaker 2>like isis posts on Facebook and then he reached out to isis and went,</v>

2438
01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:25.531
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2439
01:04:25.531 --> 01:04:27.030
<v Speaker 2>look in to complete this mission.</v>

2440
01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:29.850
<v Speaker 2>How do I get ahold of the guns and bullets?</v>

2441
01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.350
<v Speaker 2>Nicest like homeboy,</v>

2442
01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.580
<v Speaker 2>if you have to ask for the gear,</v>

2443
01:04:32.581 --> 01:04:34.110
<v Speaker 2>might not be for you.</v>

2444
01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:35.173
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck?</v>

2445
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:36.223
<v Speaker 2>They're dumb.</v>

2446
01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:41.460
<v Speaker 2>Meet us on the dock where the asshole get out of here,</v>

2447
01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:42.294
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2448
01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:44.400
<v Speaker 2>Lag on your truck as you pull up.</v>

2449
01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:46.650
<v Speaker 2>Make it super obvious.</v>

2450
01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:47.191
<v Speaker 2>Every time.</v>

2451
01:04:47.191 --> 01:04:50.010
<v Speaker 2>I've been pier 39 and I've been there every time I go to San Francisco,</v>

2452
01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:51.420
<v Speaker 2>I always think that I'm always like,</v>

2453
01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:52.283
<v Speaker 2>I don't think like that.</v>

2454
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:56.040
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people though in making this comment on why did the president not</v>

2455
01:04:56.041 --> 01:04:57.070
<v Speaker 2>discuss this like,</v>

2456
01:04:57.090 --> 01:04:59.370
<v Speaker 2>well this is something that like when you address the nation,</v>

2457
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.360
<v Speaker 2>you have to talk about it.</v>

2458
01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:03.990
<v Speaker 2>And even if he's in some sort of a squabble with one aspect of the FBI,</v>

2459
01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:06.780
<v Speaker 2>you have to recognize that they did their job here.</v>

2460
01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.850
<v Speaker 2>This is why they're great job.</v>

2461
01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:09.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2462
01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:10.380
<v Speaker 2>and this is why they're important.</v>

2463
01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Like the literally protected American lives and he's not mentioning it bullshit</v>

2464
01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 2>that they do when they're saying things like</v>

2465
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:21.280
<v Speaker 3>how Trump stole Christmas with white nationalists and Nazis,</v>

2466
01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:22.000
<v Speaker 3>that petty,</v>

2467
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.440
<v Speaker 3>that kind of petty shit and forces his petty.</v>

2468
01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.030
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2469
01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:25.290
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2470
01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:26.380
<v Speaker 3>It's in a way of real news.</v>

2471
01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:27.980
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] and they go at it.</v>

2472
01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.670
<v Speaker 3>They go at each other back and forth and nothing gets done.</v>

2473
01:05:30.671 --> 01:05:32.770
<v Speaker 3>So in these to grow the fuck up and it should be the president,</v>

2474
01:05:32.771 --> 01:05:33.980
<v Speaker 3>but he woos weak.</v>

2475
01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:35.320
<v Speaker 3>She needs to grow the fuck up too.</v>

2476
01:05:35.321 --> 01:05:36.670
<v Speaker 3>You can't say things like that.</v>

2477
01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:37.504
<v Speaker 3>That's silly.</v>

2478
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:41.410
<v Speaker 3>We should be able to rely on the mainstream news,</v>

2479
01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.830
<v Speaker 3>and I know I'm going to get a lot emails about the main Eddie Bravo who's</v>

2480
01:05:44.831 --> 01:05:45.550
<v Speaker 3>calling you right now,</v>

2481
01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:46.690
<v Speaker 3>but we should be a little,</v>

2482
01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:49.810
<v Speaker 3>we should rely on them to at least report the facts,</v>

2483
01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:52.000
<v Speaker 3>at least objective facts.</v>

2484
01:05:52.001 --> 01:05:53.350
<v Speaker 3>That was the whole point of journalism.</v>

2485
01:05:53.351 --> 01:05:55.120
<v Speaker 3>They were the fourth estate they keep,</v>

2486
01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:56.560
<v Speaker 3>they keep power in line,</v>

2487
01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:57.221
<v Speaker 3>they hold,</v>

2488
01:05:57.221 --> 01:05:58.420
<v Speaker 3>they speak truth to power.</v>

2489
01:05:58.420 --> 01:05:59.530
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole idea.</v>

2490
01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:00.400
<v Speaker 3>In a democracy,</v>

2491
01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:01.930
<v Speaker 3>you need a free press,</v>

2492
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.793
<v Speaker 3>you need,</v>

2493
01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:05.590
<v Speaker 3>but now with money ratings,</v>

2494
01:06:05.650 --> 01:06:06.790
<v Speaker 3>it has corrupted.</v>

2495
01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:08.170
<v Speaker 3>While there's also many grants,</v>

2496
01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:10.330
<v Speaker 3>the the fucking Internet man,</v>

2497
01:06:10.331 --> 01:06:13.570
<v Speaker 3>the Internet came along and pretty much anybody can be a new source now.</v>

2498
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:15.400
<v Speaker 3>Anybody can be a Hashtag.</v>

2499
01:06:15.401 --> 01:06:15.881
<v Speaker 3>Journalists,</v>

2500
01:06:15.881 --> 01:06:17.410
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of fluctuation the game up,</v>

2501
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:18.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2502
01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:18.970
<v Speaker 3>change the game up.</v>

2503
01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:20.000
<v Speaker 3>Credentials to get,</v>

2504
01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:20.360
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2505
01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.550
<v Speaker 3>I spread rumors.</v>

2506
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:22.660
<v Speaker 3>A PDF pages.</v>

2507
01:06:22.690 --> 01:06:23.800
<v Speaker 3>I was saying this the other day,</v>

2508
01:06:23.801 --> 01:06:25.300
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to remember writing something about this,</v>

2509
01:06:25.301 --> 01:06:28.600
<v Speaker 3>but like the idea that you in social media,</v>

2510
01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:29.770
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

2511
01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:33.190
<v Speaker 3>we all have moments where we do some crazy shit where we say stuff out loud</v>

2512
01:06:33.191 --> 01:06:34.960
<v Speaker 3>that's like politically incorrect and we say,</v>

2513
01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:35.291
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2514
01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:39.040
<v Speaker 3>we just behave in a way that could make you crazy,</v>

2515
01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:39.430
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2516
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2517
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:42.940
<v Speaker 3>Like my dog ran into my knee the other day.</v>

2518
01:06:42.941 --> 01:06:43.240
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2519
01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:43.450
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2520
01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:44.320
<v Speaker 3>fuck it hurt.</v>

2521
01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:46.090
<v Speaker 3>And I instinctively kicked out of,</v>

2522
01:06:46.091 --> 01:06:46.311
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2523
01:06:46.311 --> 01:06:48.880
<v Speaker 3>I was just like fucking and I kick and I missed her.</v>

2524
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:49.841
<v Speaker 3>But dude,</v>

2525
01:06:49.841 --> 01:06:53.050
<v Speaker 3>it looked like I tried to kick my fucking dog and the ribs because by the way,</v>

2526
01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:57.010
<v Speaker 3>in that mid split second I was trying to kick my dog who I love very much in the</v>

2527
01:06:57.030 --> 01:06:57.460
<v Speaker 3>restaurant.</v>

2528
01:06:57.460 --> 01:06:58.220
<v Speaker 3>She hit my knee was like,</v>

2529
01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:58.660
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2530
01:06:58.660 --> 01:06:59.350
<v Speaker 3>my actions.</v>

2531
01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:01.630
<v Speaker 3>Anything wrong with giving your dog a little knee taps?</v>

2532
01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:02.230
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>

2533
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:03.810
<v Speaker 3>If somebody caught that on camera,</v>

2534
01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.080
<v Speaker 3>so I'm a little shove,</v>

2535
01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:06.130
<v Speaker 3>somebody caught that on camera.</v>

2536
01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:08.110
<v Speaker 3>Now on a dog in the ribs,</v>

2537
01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:08.470
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2538
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:10.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying somebody it caught on the camera,</v>

2539
01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:12.610
<v Speaker 3>it would have been Brian count and if I was,</v>

2540
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.330
<v Speaker 3>if I was famous,</v>

2541
01:07:13.330 --> 01:07:13.870
<v Speaker 3>they'd be like,</v>

2542
01:07:13.870 --> 01:07:15.010
<v Speaker 3>say I was a politician or whatever.</v>

2543
01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:16.143
<v Speaker 3>I'm fun.</v>

2544
01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:16.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm done.</v>

2545
01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:17.731
<v Speaker 3>I'm the dog cat.</v>

2546
01:07:17.731 --> 01:07:18.050
<v Speaker 3>True,</v>

2547
01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:18.883
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2548
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:20.450
<v Speaker 3>That's a comedic example.</v>

2549
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.930
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

2550
01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:21.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2551
01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.260
<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying that nowadays,</v>

2552
01:07:23.261 --> 01:07:24.880
<v Speaker 3>and I was thinking about this nowadays,</v>

2553
01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.440
<v Speaker 3>anything that you do,</v>

2554
01:07:26.441 --> 01:07:27.640
<v Speaker 3>if you're having a moment,</v>

2555
01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:29.650
<v Speaker 3>if you're having a moan or you make a mistake,</v>

2556
01:07:29.651 --> 01:07:30.520
<v Speaker 3>describe a moment.</v>

2557
01:07:30.521 --> 01:07:30.820
<v Speaker 3>Dopey.</v>

2558
01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:31.960
<v Speaker 3>I thought he got to be careful with,</v>

2559
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.280
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2560
01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:33.040
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>

2561
01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.030
<v Speaker 3>you're making a mistake.</v>

2562
01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:34.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2563
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:35.703
<v Speaker 3>It could be,</v>

2564
01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:36.641
<v Speaker 3>give me an example.</v>

2565
01:07:36.641 --> 01:07:41.140
<v Speaker 3>It could be you got caught at a strip club you were making out with a girl</v>

2566
01:07:41.141 --> 01:07:41.801
<v Speaker 3>behind a dumpster,</v>

2567
01:07:41.801 --> 01:07:42.281
<v Speaker 3>but you're married,</v>

2568
01:07:42.281 --> 01:07:42.970
<v Speaker 3>whatever it might be.</v>

2569
01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:46.030
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of examples where everybody's fuckups like my buddy,</v>

2570

<v Speaker 3>my buddy saying like Kevin Hart situation,</v>

2572
01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:49.030
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

2573
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:49.121
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2574
01:07:49.121 --> 01:07:49.320
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

2575
01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.110
<v Speaker 3>my buddy,</v>

2576
01:07:50.110 --> 01:07:51.880
<v Speaker 3>my buddy who owns buildings,</v>

2577
01:07:51.881 --> 01:07:53.020
<v Speaker 3>he gets sued all the time.</v>

2578
01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:57.010
<v Speaker 3>And what he does is he'll just hire a private investigator and he h he just</v>

2579
01:07:57.011 --> 01:07:59.830
<v Speaker 3>follows the dude and he'll just follow the poor over sooner.</v>

2580
01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:00.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2581
01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:00.680
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2582
01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:01.061
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>

2583
01:08:01.061 --> 01:08:01.481
<v Speaker 3>why did he do that?</v>

2584
01:08:01.481 --> 01:08:02.230
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2585
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.591
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2586
01:08:02.591 --> 01:08:05.980
<v Speaker 3>because everybody he's ever followed,</v>

2587
01:08:06.010 --> 01:08:06.670
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

2588
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:10.480
<v Speaker 3>everybody is always fucking up in one aspect of their life.</v>

2589
01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:10.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2590
01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.710
<v Speaker 3>especially someone with sleazy who tries these like illegitimate lawsuits.</v>

2591
01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2592
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 3>He always finds</v>

2593
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:17.270
<v Speaker 1>evidence that they're just,</v>

2594
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:18.320
<v Speaker 1>they're doing something.</v>

2595
01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.461
<v Speaker 1>I got a girlfriend,</v>

2596
01:08:19.461 --> 01:08:20.091
<v Speaker 1>I've got a boyfriend.</v>

2597
01:08:20.091 --> 01:08:20.230
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2598
01:08:20.230 --> 01:08:21.140
<v Speaker 1>It's always something,</v>

2599
01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:21.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2600
01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:22.163
<v Speaker 1>You're fine.</v>

2601
01:08:22.530 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 1>So let's say in a hypothetical situation,</v>

2602
01:08:24.441 --> 01:08:25.670
<v Speaker 1>you were cheating on ref came out.</v>

2603
01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Here's the larger fine.</v>

2604
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>The larger point is this.</v>

2605
01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about like how I was taking Gandhi,</v>

2606
01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:32.750
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King,</v>

2607
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:33.883
<v Speaker 1>Hemingway,</v>

2608
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Picasso and Einstein,</v>

2609
01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:37.100
<v Speaker 1>all dirt bags,</v>

2610
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.970
<v Speaker 1>all known,</v>

2611
01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:38.751
<v Speaker 1>known,</v>

2612
01:08:38.751 --> 01:08:42.460
<v Speaker 1>philanderers known to cheat on their wives just known there.</v>

2613
01:08:42.461 --> 01:08:42.921
<v Speaker 1>They're poor.</v>

2614
01:08:42.921 --> 01:08:43.011
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2615
01:08:43.011 --> 01:08:43.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2616
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.250
<v Speaker 1>and just real real ladies,</v>

2617
01:08:46.251 --> 01:08:48.170
<v Speaker 1>men and and beyond.</v>

2618
01:08:48.350 --> 01:08:48.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2619
01:08:48.501 --> 01:08:49.334
<v Speaker 1>how about Kennedy?</v>

2620
01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2621
01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:50.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2622
01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:53.950
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to keep talking about how Bill Clinton got caught with Monica</v>

2623
01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Lewinsky to,</v>

2624
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:55.460
<v Speaker 1>there was a woman who came out,</v>

2625
01:08:55.461 --> 01:08:57.740
<v Speaker 1>it was like one of the aides and the White House who's,</v>

2626
01:08:57.830 --> 01:08:58.451
<v Speaker 1>she was abused.</v>

2627
01:08:58.451 --> 01:09:01.840
<v Speaker 1>She was 19 can be made her suck his Dick sucker from gay.</v>

2628
01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Fuck everybody.</v>

2629
01:09:03.770 --> 01:09:06.410
<v Speaker 1>And so what I'm saying is that in the day,</v>

2630
01:09:06.411 --> 01:09:11.070
<v Speaker 1>in the days of social media now we would have dilated on that and we haven't</v>

2631
01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:11.570
<v Speaker 1>looked at that.</v>

2632
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:13.060
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't have acted like that.</v>

2633
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:14.180
<v Speaker 1>What we want to focus on,</v>

2634
01:09:14.181 --> 01:09:15.200
<v Speaker 1>because with those men,</v>

2635
01:09:15.201 --> 01:09:16.400
<v Speaker 1>let's just take those men,</v>

2636
01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:20.720
<v Speaker 1>they could have been discredited and cut out at the knees depending on when</v>

2637
01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:21.290
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2638
01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:23.060
<v Speaker 1>that activity was exposed.</v>

2639
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:23.421
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2640
01:09:23.421 --> 01:09:23.761
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2641
01:09:23.761 --> 01:09:27.110
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about technology could have undermined everything they're working,</v>

2642
01:09:27.111 --> 01:09:27.650
<v Speaker 1>but hold on.</v>

2643
01:09:27.650 --> 01:09:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it possible that we need to have a more realistic understanding of what a</v>

2644
01:09:32.601 --> 01:09:33.201
<v Speaker 1>human being?</v>

2645
01:09:33.201 --> 01:09:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2646
01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:37.910
<v Speaker 1>And then seeing all these flaws in a person and then getting past that is maybe</v>

2647
01:09:37.911 --> 01:09:40.010
<v Speaker 1>the way to go the way the Europeans do.</v>

2648
01:09:40.011 --> 01:09:43.730
<v Speaker 1>But our problem is that we're dealing with this old model where everybody was</v>

2649
01:09:43.731 --> 01:09:46.160
<v Speaker 1>like some fucking Cary grant dude in a movie.</v>

2650
01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:47.420
<v Speaker 1>And w you know,</v>

2651
01:09:47.421 --> 01:09:48.740
<v Speaker 1>the good guys wore white hats.</v>

2652
01:09:48.741 --> 01:09:50.000
<v Speaker 1>The bad guys wear black hats.</v>

2653
01:09:50.001 --> 01:09:50.781
<v Speaker 1>And it's not realistic.</v>

2654
01:09:50.781 --> 01:09:51.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not realistic.</v>

2655
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:53.410
<v Speaker 1>That's not Merrill came with our products,</v>

2656
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:54.110
<v Speaker 1>but isn't it?</v>

2657
01:09:54.110 --> 01:09:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it an American?</v>

2658
01:09:55.221 --> 01:09:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Because it hasn't been exposed and we don't have a new realization of what human</v>

2659
01:09:59.001 --> 01:09:59.690
<v Speaker 1>beings are.</v>

2660
01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:04.690
<v Speaker 1>And so isn't all of this excruciating detailed information that comes out about</v>

2661
01:10:05.181 --> 01:10:09.560
<v Speaker 1>anybody that's seeking power isn't ultimately like a good thing to see.</v>

2662
01:10:09.561 --> 01:10:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2663
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:10.220
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2664
01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:11.090
<v Speaker 1>he's like me.</v>

2665
01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm fuck up.</v>

2666
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.741
<v Speaker 1>He's like me.</v>

2667
01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh that guys like me too.</v>

2668
01:10:13.611 --> 01:10:15.290
<v Speaker 1>So instead of thinking that there's some person,</v>

2669
01:10:15.410 --> 01:10:17.540
<v Speaker 1>some Dalai Lama guy who was going to come save us,</v>

2670
01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.520
<v Speaker 1>the one guy on the planet doesn't have any vices.</v>

2671
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2672
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Instead of that,</v>

2673
01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe we should have a more honest interpretation of what it means to be human</v>

2674
01:10:24.871 --> 01:10:27.410
<v Speaker 1>and passionate and understanding that sometimes we're,</v>

2675
01:10:27.411 --> 01:10:27.860
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2676
01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:28.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2677
01:10:28.220 --> 01:10:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson said something fucking amazing to me.</v>

2678
01:10:30.171 --> 01:10:30.830
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2679
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:31.161
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

2680
01:10:31.161 --> 01:10:32.600
<v Speaker 1>we're ruled by different gods.</v>

2681
01:10:32.601 --> 01:10:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Depending on the moment,</v>

2682
01:10:33.841 --> 01:10:34.580
<v Speaker 1>the time of day,</v>

2683
01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:36.320
<v Speaker 1>we're ruled by the God of sex,</v>

2684
01:10:36.321 --> 01:10:38.030
<v Speaker 1>the God of a jealousy,</v>

2685
01:10:38.031 --> 01:10:38.870
<v Speaker 1>that God of anger,</v>

2686
01:10:38.871 --> 01:10:40.070
<v Speaker 1>the god of resentment.</v>

2687
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:41.600
<v Speaker 1>It just depends on the moment,</v>

2688
01:10:41.601 --> 01:10:43.610
<v Speaker 1>which is his argument for an overreaching God.</v>

2689
01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.130
<v Speaker 1>But I want my president to be better than me.</v>

2690
01:10:46.131 --> 01:10:46.701
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2691
01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:47.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't want him to see fancy.</v>

2692
01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2693
01:10:48.210 --> 01:10:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Held to the higher standards are going to be better than you anyway.</v>

2694
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:53.390
<v Speaker 1>There's just because they have the same flaws that you have,</v>

2695
01:10:53.391 --> 01:10:55.970
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean they're not better at you than running the government running the</v>

2696
01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:56.210
<v Speaker 1>golf.</v>

2697
01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:57.700
<v Speaker 1>If he has a drug addiction,</v>

2698
01:10:57.730 --> 01:10:58.580
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking hookers,</v>

2699
01:10:58.581 --> 01:10:59.050
<v Speaker 1>not sharp.</v>

2700
01:10:59.050 --> 01:11:00.650
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to run in my country.</v>

2701
01:11:00.651 --> 01:11:02.360
<v Speaker 1>And you'll be held can be the mayor of Toronto.</v>

2702
01:11:02.361 --> 01:11:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Like Rob Ford did a great job while I was mayor of Toronto Smoking crack.</v>

2703
01:11:05.691 --> 01:11:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Clinton wasn't bad either.</v>

2704
01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:08.631
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2705
01:11:08.631 --> 01:11:09.550
<v Speaker 1>I just think we need,</v>

2706
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:14.520
<v Speaker 1>we need a more nuance point of view of what human are and I think we've lost it.</v>

2707
01:11:14.521 --> 01:11:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I think we're very Americans,</v>

2708
01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:18.680
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's the think people are being held accountable more.</v>

2709
01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:19.321
<v Speaker 1>There'll be like,</v>

2710
01:11:19.321 --> 01:11:21.870
<v Speaker 1>there's actual like bad dudes who are like,</v>

2711
01:11:21.871 --> 01:11:22.310
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2712
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.771
<v Speaker 1>it's out.</v>

2713
01:11:22.771 --> 01:11:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2714
01:11:23.150 --> 01:11:23.520
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2715
01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.440
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and bad.</v>

2716
01:11:25.441 --> 01:11:26.430
<v Speaker 1>There's good and bad to this,</v>

2717
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:27.151
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just,</v>

2718
01:11:27.151 --> 01:11:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I just hope that we come back around and the fact that human beings are</v>

2719
01:11:30.331 --> 01:11:31.160
<v Speaker 1>complicated,</v>

2720
01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:32.730
<v Speaker 1>that we're all fucking up that,</v>

2721
01:11:32.731 --> 01:11:35.310
<v Speaker 1>that it just because I fucked them in this atmospheric doesn't mean I'm a bad</v>

2722
01:11:35.311 --> 01:11:36.570
<v Speaker 1>person all the way through it.</v>

2723
01:11:36.571 --> 01:11:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Trevor Noah said something that that was interesting.</v>

2724
01:11:38.821 --> 01:11:39.570
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2725
01:11:39.570 --> 01:11:39.940
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

2726
01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:42.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand about Americans is how you can't be both things.</v>

2727
01:11:42.601 --> 01:11:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have to be one thing or another?</v>

2728
01:11:43.831 --> 01:11:45.120
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have a black hat or white hat.</v>

2729
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.961
<v Speaker 1>Can you be,</v>

2730
01:11:45.961 --> 01:11:49.830
<v Speaker 1>is it possible to sympathize with the black lives matter?</v>

2731
01:11:49.831 --> 01:11:51.270
<v Speaker 1>And also be pro cop.</v>

2732
01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Can you,</v>

2733
01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:55.020
<v Speaker 1>can you have both hospital and picks teams?</v>

2734
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:56.850
<v Speaker 1>We've had to pick teams teams in a way.</v>

2735
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Well it can't be calming to pick teams for sure.</v>

2736
01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:00.840
<v Speaker 1>And so it's an instinct that we have.</v>

2737
01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I think we're getting better and understanding what a human being is.</v>

2738
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.430
<v Speaker 1>And I think to equate Harvey Weinstein with finding flaws and politicians is</v>

2739
01:12:08.431 --> 01:12:09.061
<v Speaker 1>very different.</v>

2740
01:12:09.061 --> 01:12:09.390
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2741
01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Because what he's doing,</v>

2742
01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:14.010
<v Speaker 1>what he was doing was essentially he was not just that,</v>

2743
01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:14.820
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2744
01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:15.653
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

2745
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:18.140
<v Speaker 1>that was part of how we engineered his business.</v>

2746
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:23.630
<v Speaker 1>He engineered his business to like feed his sexual harassing and sexual assault</v>

2747
01:12:24.541 --> 01:12:27.170
<v Speaker 1>appetites a piece of shit that's going on,</v>

2748
01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:29.190
<v Speaker 1>another contract that's going on.</v>

2749
01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:30.930
<v Speaker 1>I think in other corporations,</v>

2750
01:12:30.931 --> 01:12:32.130
<v Speaker 1>just not an entertainment.</v>

2751
01:12:32.131 --> 01:12:33.030
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

2752
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:34.510
<v Speaker 1>I think the way he did it,</v>

2753
01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:36.690
<v Speaker 1>the girls had to fuck them to get parts.</v>

2754
01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2755
01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I think he's an outlier.</v>

2756
01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:38.291
<v Speaker 1>I think he's,</v>

2757
01:12:38.291 --> 01:12:39.124
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

2758
01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:40.170
<v Speaker 1>I think he's an outlier.</v>

2759
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.033
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

2760
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I think when it comes power and there's print and there's pretty girls,</v>

2761
01:12:45.211 --> 01:12:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I think men are going to abuse that power.</v>

2762
01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2763
01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:48.480
<v Speaker 1>But Duane levels.</v>

2764
01:12:50.210 --> 01:12:50.881
<v Speaker 1>Some guys,</v>

2765
01:12:50.881 --> 01:12:54.480
<v Speaker 1>if you think Harvey Weinstein in that position of power is the only guy to do</v>

2766
01:12:54.481 --> 01:12:55.280
<v Speaker 1>that to that level.</v>

2767
01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Your credit may be our arts women are also drawn to power.</v>

2768
01:12:58.231 --> 01:12:58.471
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2769
01:12:58.471 --> 01:13:01.590
<v Speaker 1>So I like how you guys try each other be like you're fucking 15 year old kids in</v>

2770
01:13:01.591 --> 01:13:01.951
<v Speaker 1>Brooklyn.</v>

2771
01:13:01.951 --> 01:13:02.784
<v Speaker 1>You have to work</v>

2772
01:13:04.530 --> 01:13:04.890
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

2773
01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:09.890
<v Speaker 1>because we're a couple of cuties C and I agree it's scary but I think it's a</v>

2774
01:13:10.111 --> 01:13:11.610
<v Speaker 1>witch hunt only for witches,</v>

2775
01:13:11.611 --> 01:13:11.950
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2776
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2777
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:13.260
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't bother them.</v>

2778
01:13:13.261 --> 01:13:13.471
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2779
01:13:13.471 --> 01:13:15.130
<v Speaker 1>you can't say these guys get turned down.</v>

2780
01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:19.290
<v Speaker 1>You can't say that because of witch hunt is that the witch hunt is also like</v>

2781
01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:22.030
<v Speaker 1>based on hearsay and accusation and not proof.</v>

2782
01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:22.560
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

2783
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.240
<v Speaker 1>you have to have due process for some.</v>

2784
01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2785
01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.100
<v Speaker 1>For some you have to have due process.</v>

2786
01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:26.460
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>

2787
01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:31.230
<v Speaker 1>W We all know that we live now at a time when just accusations can ruin your</v>

2788
01:13:31.231 --> 01:13:32.064
<v Speaker 1>entire career.</v>

2789
01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2790
01:13:32.330 --> 01:13:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think part of Appleby whose career has it ruined?</v>

2791
01:13:35.461 --> 01:13:36.294
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't true.</v>

2792
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't nursing Keillor.</v>

2793
01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Garrison Keillor is a good example.</v>

2794
01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Garrison Keillor's the best example,</v>

2795
01:13:40.741 --> 01:13:43.170
<v Speaker 1>and he's a guy like his entire career has been known as this,</v>

2796
01:13:43.171 --> 01:13:44.720
<v Speaker 1>like Super Nice Guy Consoles.</v>

2797
01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:46.020
<v Speaker 1>A woman hugs her,</v>

2798
01:13:46.021 --> 01:13:46.741
<v Speaker 1>his hand goes down,</v>

2799
01:13:46.741 --> 01:13:48.930
<v Speaker 1>her shirt on her back,</v>

2800
01:13:49.230 --> 01:13:49.830
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

2801
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:50.790
<v Speaker 1>she pulls back,</v>

2802
01:13:50.791 --> 01:13:51.481
<v Speaker 1>he apologized,</v>

2803
01:13:51.481 --> 01:13:54.450
<v Speaker 1>he sends her a letter apologizing and she accepts it.</v>

2804
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.570
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2805
01:13:54.570 --> 01:13:56.310
<v Speaker 1>they stay friends and then she goes public,</v>

2806
01:13:56.311 --> 01:13:56.551
<v Speaker 1>whether it,</v>

2807
01:13:56.551 --> 01:13:57.880
<v Speaker 1>when all this meat to stuff comes out,</v>

2808
01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:58.790
<v Speaker 1>just feels compiled.</v>

2809
01:13:59.210 --> 01:13:59.640
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2810
01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:00.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2811
01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:00.571
<v Speaker 1>she'd done,</v>

2812
01:14:00.571 --> 01:14:00.841
<v Speaker 1>didn't get,</v>

2813
01:14:00.841 --> 01:14:01.080
<v Speaker 1>just get,</v>

2814
01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:01.860
<v Speaker 1>just get fired.</v>

2815
01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:03.090
<v Speaker 1>They changed the name of his thing.</v>

2816
01:14:03.091 --> 01:14:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll Franken Franken admitted he did some shit that he shouldn't have done and</v>

2817
01:14:06.781 --> 01:14:08.680
<v Speaker 1>grab some butts out.</v>

2818
01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:09.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2819
01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to almost a better point.</v>

2820
01:14:10.921 --> 01:14:13.150
<v Speaker 1>I how I think he's a farmer.</v>

2821
01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:14.523
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad guy either.</v>

2822
01:14:15.610 --> 01:14:16.443
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2823
01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:19.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a good example for a while and then he couldn't,</v>

2824
01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:21.510
<v Speaker 1>and all the Democrats now or have in the,</v>

2825
01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.740
<v Speaker 1>in in Minnesota are having second thoughts.</v>

2826
01:14:23.741 --> 01:14:24.640
<v Speaker 1>He shouldn't retire.</v>

2827
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:24.941
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2828
01:14:24.941 --> 01:14:26.050
<v Speaker 1>you fucking guys.</v>

2829
01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:28.180
<v Speaker 1>You'd mobbed up on Twitter.</v>

2830
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Like a little proportion.</v>

2831
01:14:29.801 --> 01:14:30.511
<v Speaker 1>We need to have,</v>

2832
01:14:30.511 --> 01:14:31.440
<v Speaker 1>as we though you're,</v>

2833
01:14:31.441 --> 01:14:35.350
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about such a large number of some national marred up because it's</v>

2834
01:14:35.351 --> 01:14:36.310
<v Speaker 1>naturally in there.</v>

2835
01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:38.920
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking behavior pattern.</v>

2836
01:14:38.921 --> 01:14:41.710
<v Speaker 1>There needs to be a national narrative on where the line is too.</v>

2837
01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.630
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't know whether like I knew where the line is,</v>

2838
01:14:43.631 --> 01:14:44.740
<v Speaker 1>you know where the line is to me,</v>

2839
01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:48.910
<v Speaker 1>like if you don't want something and I'm humiliating you are embarrassing you</v>

2840
01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:49.500
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2841
01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:53.350
<v Speaker 1>and if I did that because I'm an idiot then then I got to make amends and figure</v>

2842
01:14:53.351 --> 01:14:54.130
<v Speaker 1>out what I did wrong.</v>

2843
01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:55.150
<v Speaker 1>You're 100% right,</v>

2844
01:14:55.151 --> 01:14:57.520
<v Speaker 1>but we have to understand what you're saying when you're saying the line.</v>

2845
01:14:57.550 --> 01:15:01.510
<v Speaker 1>The line includes free speech and free speech for 320 million people is going to</v>

2846
01:15:01.511 --> 01:15:04.900
<v Speaker 1>leave an exorbitant amount of human beings that feel like they should gang up on</v>

2847
01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:05.531
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

2848
01:15:05.531 --> 01:15:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Anytime something goes sideways and that's what you see and that's what you</v>

2849
01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:08.951
<v Speaker 1>feel.</v>

2850
01:15:08.951 --> 01:15:12.790
<v Speaker 1>And that had been telling media companies react to that because they don't want</v>

2851
01:15:12.791 --> 01:15:13.391
<v Speaker 1>blow back.</v>

2852
01:15:13.391 --> 01:15:14.620
<v Speaker 1>They don't want boycotts.</v>

2853
01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:15.980
<v Speaker 1>They step in and fire pieces of the,</v>

2854
01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:16.870
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't get fired.</v>

2855
01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:19.000
<v Speaker 1>But I think in the workplace it's scary.</v>

2856
01:15:19.001 --> 01:15:19.751
<v Speaker 1>Even for me,</v>

2857
01:15:19.751 --> 01:15:20.250
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

2858
01:15:20.250 --> 01:15:23.860
<v Speaker 1>the a female cup the other night where in the lead up and you know I'm into</v>

2859
01:15:23.861 --> 01:15:25.570
<v Speaker 1>fashion and what was too gay with it,</v>

2860
01:15:25.571 --> 01:15:27.070
<v Speaker 1>but she had this dope coat on.</v>

2861
01:15:27.071 --> 01:15:27.904
<v Speaker 1>I thought about,</v>

2862
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I said something about a cutlet.</v>

2863
01:15:29.341 --> 01:15:29.620
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

2864
01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:30.940
<v Speaker 1>ah fuck was that too?</v>

2865
01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Like it was like two Ford with her about a coat.</v>

2866
01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:34.450
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm scared of it.</v>

2867
01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:35.990
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be careful how it's,</v>

2868
01:15:37.530 --> 01:15:38.590
<v Speaker 1>there's a male in the room.</v>

2869
01:15:38.591 --> 01:15:38.951
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2870
01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:39.131
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2871
01:15:39.131 --> 01:15:40.030
<v Speaker 1>where'd you get that coat from?</v>

2872
01:15:40.031 --> 01:15:40.864
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about coats.</v>

2873
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:43.260
<v Speaker 1>And I saw hers and then she was about to go onstage.</v>

2874
01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:44.163
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2875
01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:45.161
<v Speaker 1>I love your coat.</v>

2876
01:15:45.161 --> 01:15:45.994
<v Speaker 1>That coat is dope.</v>

2877
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.650
<v Speaker 1>And I grabbed her arm.</v>

2878
01:15:47.651 --> 01:15:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2879

<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

2882
01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:52.320

<v Speaker 1>oh well it depends cause your intentions,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like you really like the way I would look at a nice car.</v>

2890
01:16:03.970 --> 01:16:04.151

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:11.750
<v Speaker 1>not say anything about a woman the way she looks in the office place.</v>

2934
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Can't she just be another,</v>

2935
01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:14.360
<v Speaker 1>a woman was asking.</v>

01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:18.291
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2941
01:17:18.291 --> 01:17:19.124
<v Speaker 1>a woman.</v>

2942
01:17:19.230 --> 01:17:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Be a man.</v>

2943
01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:22.940
<v Speaker 1>You want to compliment somebody.</v>

2944
01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:23.370
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2945
01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:24.920
<v Speaker 1>there's also the reality,</v>

2946
01:17:24.921 --> 01:17:26.720
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that I've been talking about in my act,</v>

2947
01:17:26.721 --> 01:17:26.990
<v Speaker 1>a law.</v>

2948
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:31.990
<v Speaker 1>There's a reality of the way women are allowed to dress both on television and</v>

2949
01:17:32.301 --> 01:17:37.301
<v Speaker 1>in real life in office situations where they expose enormous swats of skin,</v>

2950
01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:39.200
<v Speaker 1>which men are not.</v>

2951
01:17:39.201 --> 01:17:43.890
<v Speaker 1>If men in the office were wearing skirts and you could see their toes and they</v>

2952
01:17:43.891 --> 01:17:46.040
<v Speaker 1>had sleeveless shirts and this is common,</v>

2953
01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:49.400
<v Speaker 1>this is commonplace and there's nothing wrong with it and is nothing</v>

2954
01:17:49.401 --> 01:17:50.270
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate about it.</v>

2955
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:50.750
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not,</v>

2956
01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:53.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm not commenting on it like criticizing it,</v>

2957
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:55.880
<v Speaker 1>but the reality of the way women are allowed to dress.</v>

2958
01:17:55.881 --> 01:17:58.130
<v Speaker 1>Like if you watch Megan Kelly on television,</v>

2959
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.851
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

2960
01:17:58.851 --> 01:18:01.490
<v Speaker 1>especially during the Fox News days when she's the Ice Princess,</v>

2961
01:18:01.491 --> 01:18:05.600
<v Speaker 1>she wore these very small dresses that looked like she was going out for a hot</v>

2962
01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:06.433
<v Speaker 1>night on the town.</v>

2963
01:18:06.620 --> 01:18:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

2964
01:18:06.930 --> 01:18:07.820
<v Speaker 1>bring that up for a sec.</v>

2965
01:18:07.821 --> 01:18:08.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad thing man.</v>

2966
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:09.440
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2967
01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:12.050
<v Speaker 1>there's visionaries that just show women on Fox News,</v>

2968
01:18:12.051 --> 01:18:15.890
<v Speaker 1>criss crossing and uncrossing their legs and then dangling there shoes off</v>

2969
01:18:15.930 --> 01:18:16.763
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2970
01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Check out the weather girls in Latin America there's weather than La son</v>

2971
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:21.620
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

2972
01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:22.371
<v Speaker 1>So girls,</v>

2973
01:18:22.371 --> 01:18:26.360
<v Speaker 1>the girls that dress like that should be allowed address any fucking way they</v>

2974
01:18:26.361 --> 01:18:26.930
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

2975
01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:31.550
<v Speaker 1>But there is a reality of the way they're dressing that is way more sexually</v>

2976
01:18:31.551 --> 01:18:35.960
<v Speaker 1>suggestive than anything that a man is allowed to where there's not a sexual</v>

2977
01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:37.820
<v Speaker 1>equality when it comes to wardrobe,</v>

2978
01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.800
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to wardrobe and an office,</v>

2979
01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:44.030
<v Speaker 1>if every woman dress like Barbara Walters in the 1980s more fucking pants suit</v>

2980
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.721
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2981
01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:48.020
<v Speaker 1>had like one of those big collars on and shit like dress like Ellen,</v>

2982
01:18:48.260 --> 01:18:50.480
<v Speaker 1>like every woman was like Ellen when she hosts her shit.</v>

2983
01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.590
<v Speaker 1>This is why all of that should be in Berkus.</v>

2984
01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:53.331
<v Speaker 1>But that is,</v>

2985
01:18:53.331 --> 01:18:54.410
<v Speaker 1>but that outfit,</v>

2986
01:18:54.411 --> 01:18:57.980
<v Speaker 1>that Ellen outfit is basic like a female version of what men were.</v>

2987
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:59.510
<v Speaker 1>When men are on television,</v>

2988
01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.040
<v Speaker 1>they wear a suit jacket.</v>

2989
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:02.570
<v Speaker 1>They were and I shirt,</v>

2990
01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:06.920
<v Speaker 1>they wear pants cause that isn't there also a truth to how men naturally are</v>

2991
01:19:06.921 --> 01:19:08.810
<v Speaker 1>drawn to women in certain outfits.</v>

2992
01:19:08.811 --> 01:19:13.811

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:10.030
<v Speaker 1>I just got to the game.</v>

3034
01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:11.220
<v Speaker 1>We have to,</v>

3035
01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:13.440
<v Speaker 1>we have to make sure that we let everybody know what we're saying here.</v>

3036
01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:16.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that women should be sexually harassed because they dress sec.</v>

3037
01:20:16.241 --> 01:20:19.410
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm saying if you wear something that looks nice in the office,</v>

3038
01:20:19.411 --> 01:20:20.310

3041
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:23.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem because that was,</v>

3042
01:20:23.431 --> 01:20:24.750
<v Speaker 1>the girl responds to that.</v>

3043
01:20:24.751 --> 01:20:25.380
<v Speaker 1>Then the guy's like,</v>

3044
01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:25.591
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:30.900
<v Speaker 1>I see she has to beat heads full about how she walks to the water cooler by</v>

3047
01:20:30.901 --> 01:20:33.660
<v Speaker 1>herself and you've got to come up to her and she's on her way to the bathroom</v>

3048
01:20:33.661 --> 01:20:34.950
<v Speaker 1>and ask her weird questions.</v>

3049
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:36.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a Mama,</v>

3050
01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:38.400
<v Speaker 1>but don't a lot of people get married in the workplace?</v>

3051
01:20:38.401 --> 01:20:39.870

3056
01:20:43.711 --> 01:20:44.191
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

3059
01:20:48.691 --> 01:20:49.680
<v Speaker 1>and women unhappy.</v>

3060
01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Puritanical.</v>

3061
01:20:51.570 --> 01:20:52.940

3066
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:05.670
<v Speaker 1>And I also know a lot where the writer would hook up with one of the girls in</v>

3067
01:21:05.671 --> 01:21:09.140
<v Speaker 1>production and then they would break up and it would be a fucking disaster on</v>

3068
01:21:09.141 --> 01:21:11.100
<v Speaker 1>the sat and one of them would wind up leaving.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No child rapists,</v>

3118
01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:49.110
<v Speaker 1>I have to be protected.</v>

3119
01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:50.480
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of guys that are in jail.</v>

3120
01:22:50.481 --> 01:22:50.820
<v Speaker 1>He pretty,</v>

3121
01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:52.110
<v Speaker 1>so Neil got arrested once,</v>

3122
01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:53.310
<v Speaker 1>falsely accused of rape,</v>

3123
01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:55.920
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that he said was that when he went to jail,</v>

3124
01:22:55.921 --> 01:22:57.750
<v Speaker 1>he was worried and guys would be like,</v>

3125
01:22:57.751 --> 01:22:57.961
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3126
01:22:57.961 --> 01:22:58.070
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3127
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.200

<v Speaker 1>that's a skin beef.</v>

3129
01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:00.570
<v Speaker 1>They would call it a skin beef.</v>

3130
01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:01.081
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3131
01:23:01.081 --> 01:23:03.180
<v Speaker 1>that's not like no one thinks you're a rapist is one thing.</v>

3132
01:23:03.181 --> 01:23:05.780
<v Speaker 1>If you get accused of being like some serial rapist breaking a window,</v>

3133
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:06.843
<v Speaker 1>then you're fine.</v>

3134
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:07.870
<v Speaker 1>But a guy who will,</v>

3135
01:23:07.871 --> 01:23:08.560
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>

3136
01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.030
<v Speaker 1>they have a dispute in the girl,</v>

3137
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.181
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3138
01:23:10.181 --> 01:23:11.200
<v Speaker 1>claims the guy raped her,</v>

3139
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:14.920
<v Speaker 1>which no one wants to admit happens and it happens way less.</v>

3140
01:23:14.921 --> 01:23:19.921
<v Speaker 1>I think way more women don't report rape way more than women report false rape.</v>

3141
01:23:21.790 --> 01:23:26.790
<v Speaker 1>I agree 100% way more women are in Cabarrus disturbed sick and they feel</v>

3142
01:23:28.481 --> 01:23:29.201
<v Speaker 1>dehumanized.</v>

3143
01:23:29.201 --> 01:23:30.280
<v Speaker 1>They don't even want to discuss it.</v>

3144
01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:34.750
<v Speaker 1>They would rather not be outed as someone who got raped and let this person get</v>

3145
01:23:34.751 --> 01:23:35.470
<v Speaker 1>away with it.</v>

3146
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:36.850
<v Speaker 1>That's a common thing with women.</v>

3147
01:23:36.890 --> 01:23:37.050
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3148
01:23:37.050 --> 01:23:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I think some of this Hashtag [inaudible] is good,</v>

3149
01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:41.020
<v Speaker 1>but also some women lie.</v>

3150
01:23:41.650 --> 01:23:42.340
<v Speaker 1>That happens too.</v>

3151
01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:43.173
<v Speaker 1>That's a bummer.</v>

3152
01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:43.900
<v Speaker 1>But you can't.</v>

3153
01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:44.351
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

3154
01:23:44.351 --> 01:23:45.190
<v Speaker 1>But they're humans.</v>

3155
01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:45.941
<v Speaker 1>They're humans.</v>

3156
01:23:45.941 --> 01:23:48.760
<v Speaker 1>We can't tailor everything towards those few negative apple.</v>

3157
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:49.391
<v Speaker 1>No you don't.</v>

3158
01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:53.660
<v Speaker 1>But you don't tailor anything towards the idea that those apples are nonexistent</v>

3159
01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:54.490
<v Speaker 1>and impossible.</v>

3160
01:23:54.490 --> 01:23:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

3161
01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:56.830
<v Speaker 1>But I'm going back to the office space.</v>

3162
01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:58.480
<v Speaker 1>You're going to always deal with false accusations.</v>

3163
01:23:58.510 --> 01:24:00.250
<v Speaker 1>You're going to deal with people that don't report things.</v>

3164
01:24:00.251 --> 01:24:01.540
<v Speaker 1>You're going to deal with all these things in the,</v>

3165
01:24:01.541 --> 01:24:03.160
<v Speaker 1>in the wide spectrum of humanity.</v>

3166
01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:06.910
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that this zero tolerance,</v>

3167
01:24:06.911 --> 01:24:08.680
<v Speaker 1>nobody's allowed to date anybody because we don't want to.</v>

3168
01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's where we're at.</v>

3169
01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:11.220
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>

3170
01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:12.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree.</v>

3171
01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:15.110
<v Speaker 1>We talked about it on our show and I never even thought about too.</v>

3172
01:24:15.111 --> 01:24:16.990
<v Speaker 1>We were at the comedy store and when I told that girl,</v>

3173
01:24:16.991 --> 01:24:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Nice Coda,</v>

3174
01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck did I see creek?</v>

3175
01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

3176
01:24:19.810 --> 01:24:20.561
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's young.</v>

3177
01:24:20.561 --> 01:24:22.780
<v Speaker 1>You know she's 21 amazing comic.</v>

3178
01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Pissed,</v>

3179
01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:24.180
<v Speaker 1>pissed.</v>

3180
01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

3181
01:24:26.370 --> 01:24:28.450
<v Speaker 1>You guys are very wrestling each other nephew.</v>

3182
01:24:28.451 --> 01:24:29.450
<v Speaker 1>One more fucking loose.</v>

3183
01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:30.293
<v Speaker 1>His nephew,</v>

3184
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:31.061
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3185
01:24:31.061 --> 01:24:32.800
<v Speaker 1>He's going to some school like is can't talk.</v>

3186
01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:35.170
<v Speaker 1>You don't go pee.</v>

3187
01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:36.333
<v Speaker 1>I'll be right back.</v>

3188
01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ pan.</v>

3189
01:24:37.961 --> 01:24:40.420
<v Speaker 1>He gets on you two are like an old married couple.</v>

3190
01:24:40.421 --> 01:24:41.254
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>

3191
01:24:41.290 --> 01:24:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3192
01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:42.820
<v Speaker 1>I want to kill him some days,</v>

3193
01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:47.630
<v Speaker 1>but I think we're talking too much about sexual harassment.</v>

3194
01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:48.370
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

3195
01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:49.330
<v Speaker 1>And I think people,</v>

3196
01:24:49.331 --> 01:24:50.200
<v Speaker 1>people will shut it down.</v>

3197
01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:53.860
<v Speaker 1>You know what the problem is with sexual harassment too is it's everywhere.</v>

3198
01:24:53.890 --> 01:24:55.630
<v Speaker 1>So shows like this,</v>

3199
01:24:55.631 --> 01:24:57.330
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to fucking hit for it here either.</v>

3200
01:24:58.270 --> 01:24:59.290
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to work it out.</v>

3201
01:24:59.291 --> 01:25:01.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the important things about talking about it,</v>

3202
01:25:01.571 --> 01:25:02.201
<v Speaker 1>but the problem has,</v>

3203
01:25:02.201 --> 01:25:04.450
<v Speaker 1>men are talking about it like we don't know Jack Shit about it.</v>

3204
01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:05.171
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

3205
01:25:05.171 --> 01:25:07.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't really deal with deal with it and we don't,</v>

3206
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:08.321
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>

3207
01:25:08.321 --> 01:25:10.180
<v Speaker 1>like no one's coming at us with it.</v>

3208
01:25:10.330 --> 01:25:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Like I've only had gay guys hit on me aggressively a couple of times ever in my</v>

3209
01:25:13.631 --> 01:25:15.280
<v Speaker 1>life and it was day tried sucking my Dick.</v>

3210
01:25:15.281 --> 01:25:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I felt uncomfortable.</v>

3211
01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Andy Dick,</v>

3212
01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:17.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm just kidding by the way.</v>

3213
01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:18.701
<v Speaker 1>I've tried,</v>

3214
01:25:18.701 --> 01:25:19.534
<v Speaker 1>but he's awesome.</v>

3215
01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:21.430
<v Speaker 1>I had a comic once,</v>

3216
01:25:21.710 --> 01:25:25.330
<v Speaker 1>the Montreal comedy festival like late at night when we're all hanging around</v>

3217
01:25:25.331 --> 01:25:25.840
<v Speaker 1>the bar,</v>

3218
01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.610
<v Speaker 1>get super aggressive with me.</v>

3219
01:25:28.030 --> 01:25:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Yay.</v>

3220
01:25:28.410 --> 01:25:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3221
01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:29.980
<v Speaker 1>super way back in the day.</v>

3222
01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:31.263
<v Speaker 1>This is like,</v>

3223
01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:36.140
<v Speaker 1>I want to say like late nineties real uncomfortable moment where I'd tell him to</v>

3224
01:25:36.141 --> 01:25:40.000
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck away from me due to it could have been some problems.</v>

3225
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:40.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3226
01:25:40.690 --> 01:25:43.000
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like a physically threatening thing.</v>

3227
01:25:43.001 --> 01:25:46.180
<v Speaker 1>I literally told them I would stomp a fucking hole in his chest if he touched me</v>

3228
01:25:46.181 --> 01:25:46.340
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

3229
01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:46.871
<v Speaker 1>Didn't work.</v>

3230
01:25:46.871 --> 01:25:47.704
<v Speaker 1>It didn't turn on.</v>

3231
01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:48.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3232
01:25:48.190 --> 01:25:48.900
<v Speaker 1>it worked.</v>

3233
01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3234
01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:49.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3235
01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:50.680
<v Speaker 1>I was serious.</v>

3236
01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:50.981
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3237
01:25:50.981 --> 01:25:53.980
<v Speaker 1>you gotta stop punching blows up when he was drunk and I wasn't.</v>

3238
01:25:54.370 --> 01:25:57.310
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those weird moments where someone is like being sexually</v>

3239
01:25:57.311 --> 01:25:57.731
<v Speaker 1>aggressive.</v>

3240
01:25:57.731 --> 01:26:00.670
<v Speaker 1>They think it's funny and then then they tried to take it to the next level,</v>

3241
01:26:00.671 --> 01:26:02.050
<v Speaker 1>show you how crazy they are.</v>

3242
01:26:02.051 --> 01:26:03.650
<v Speaker 1>At some point that I was like,</v>

3243
01:26:03.651 --> 01:26:04.910
<v Speaker 1>did you not touch me like this?</v>

3244
01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:05.953
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized like,</v>

3245
01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:06.261
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3246
01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:10.070
<v Speaker 1>this is what it's like when you're a woman except the woman can't kill the guy.</v>

3247
01:26:10.071 --> 01:26:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm dealing with a doughy drunk comedian than I could kill.</v>

3248
01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:14.151
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3249
01:26:14.151 --> 01:26:14.821
<v Speaker 1>If he tried anything,</v>

3250
01:26:14.821 --> 01:26:15.950
<v Speaker 1>he just whoop his ass.</v>

3251
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:16.990
<v Speaker 1>Where women don't have worries,</v>

3252
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.050
<v Speaker 1>they don't have that option.</v>

3253
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:20.870
<v Speaker 1>At all and it's not funny.</v>

3254
01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:21.740
<v Speaker 1>They weren't,</v>

3255
01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:22.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3256
01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:22.881
<v Speaker 1>with a woman.</v>

3257
01:26:22.881 --> 01:26:24.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not a funny situation with me.</v>

3258
01:26:24.291 --> 01:26:25.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like it was funny.</v>

3259
01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.170
<v Speaker 1>It was never like I was nervous,</v>

3260
01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.281
<v Speaker 1>but it was like,</v>

3261
01:26:28.281 --> 01:26:28.551
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

3262
01:26:28.551 --> 01:26:29.420
<v Speaker 1>this is gross.</v>

3263
01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:29.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3264
01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:31.820
<v Speaker 1>I think you look at it a different too because you have two daughters.</v>

3265
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I do now that I'm saying now it's like,</v>

3266
01:26:35.271 --> 01:26:36.104
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

3267
01:26:36.850 --> 01:26:38.000
<v Speaker 1>you do that.</v>

3268
01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:39.380
<v Speaker 1>He just having children,</v>

3269
01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:39.640
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3270
01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:43.100
<v Speaker 1>you look at people so differently because children are so vulnerable and when</v>

3271
01:26:43.101 --> 01:26:45.620
<v Speaker 1>you have a little kid and you see that little kid trying to make your way</v>

3272
01:26:45.621 --> 01:26:46.191
<v Speaker 1>through the world,</v>

3273
01:26:46.191 --> 01:26:50.450
<v Speaker 1>you think about them being victimized by some sort of an evil Predator and it's</v>

3274
01:26:50.451 --> 01:26:51.350
<v Speaker 1>fucking awful.</v>

3275
01:26:51.351 --> 01:26:52.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible feeling.</v>

3276
01:26:52.551 --> 01:26:52.821
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

3277
01:26:52.821 --> 01:26:53.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

3278
01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:57.290
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird thing that we have to reconcile the fact that some people do prey</v>

3279
01:26:57.291 --> 01:26:58.124
<v Speaker 1>on other peoples.</v>

3280
01:26:58.430 --> 01:27:00.920
<v Speaker 1>What vulnerabilities and weaknesses and do,</v>

3281
01:27:00.921 --> 01:27:01.560
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

3282
01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:02.170
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3283
01:27:02.170 --> 01:27:02.880
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

3284
01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:05.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking for a new nanny and you hear all these horrible stories about</v>

3285
01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:07.070
<v Speaker 1>nannies and the molests kids,</v>

3286
01:27:07.071 --> 01:27:09.080
<v Speaker 1>so it's the less kids being kids.</v>

3287
01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:13.450
<v Speaker 1>There's some horrible videos of of nannies like lifting kids up and throwing him</v>

3288
01:27:13.451 --> 01:27:15.920
<v Speaker 1>against their crib and you can't watch them.</v>

3289
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:18.780
<v Speaker 1>They're so infuriating pieces.</v>

3290
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:20.060
<v Speaker 1>One kid,</v>

3291
01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:23.690
<v Speaker 1>it was all fucked up and bruised and the parents put this fucking camera and</v>

3292
01:27:23.691 --> 01:27:27.200
<v Speaker 1>they caught the lady picking the kid up by his arms and literally throwing them</v>

3293
01:27:27.201 --> 01:27:28.640
<v Speaker 1>across the room and you watch it.</v>

3294
01:27:28.641 --> 01:27:29.150
<v Speaker 1>You just like,</v>

3295
01:27:29.150 --> 01:27:30.350
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

3296
01:27:30.351 --> 01:27:31.790
<v Speaker 1>tough for me not to go to prison.</v>

3297
01:27:31.791 --> 01:27:33.890
<v Speaker 1>If I came home and saw that it would be really slow.</v>

3298
01:27:33.891 --> 01:27:36.320
<v Speaker 1>So to have more self control,</v>

3299
01:27:36.321 --> 01:27:37.630
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people it'd be soap,</v>

3300
01:27:37.631 --> 01:27:39.090
<v Speaker 1>tough to choke.</v>

3301
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.621
<v Speaker 1>You know what they say?</v>

3302
01:27:39.621 --> 01:27:43.820
<v Speaker 1>They gave the gave rise to the helicopter parent phenomenon and one of the</v>

3303
01:27:43.821 --> 01:27:47.600
<v Speaker 1>things they talk about like how how students are so entitled and they became</v>

3304
01:27:47.601 --> 01:27:50.510
<v Speaker 1>sort of like this idea that they can say anything they want and you know,</v>

3305
01:27:50.511 --> 01:27:54.230
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of the whole movement of my personal serenity has everything.</v>

3306
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:55.783
<v Speaker 1>One of the,</v>

3307
01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:58.220
<v Speaker 1>one of the theories would be that in the 80s,</v>

3308
01:27:58.790 --> 01:28:01.420
<v Speaker 1>when kids started disappearing and you started reading about it,</v>

3309
01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:02.880
<v Speaker 1>the end up on the back of my opponents,</v>

3310
01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:04.910
<v Speaker 1>all of us as parents,</v>

3311
01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:06.140
<v Speaker 1>as human beings,</v>

3312
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:07.910
<v Speaker 1>like there's nothing worse,</v>

3313
01:28:07.911 --> 01:28:08.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3314
01:28:08.150 --> 01:28:09.170
<v Speaker 1>You can't think of anything worse.</v>

3315
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:11.900
<v Speaker 1>And that created this.</v>

3316
01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Every parent your biggest fear right now you go,</v>

3317
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:19.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm not letting my kid take his bike down to the neighbors cause it might only</v>

3318
01:28:19.791 --> 01:28:21.020
<v Speaker 1>be 600 yards,</v>

3319
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.800
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3320
01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:22.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3321
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:25.290
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne Gacy might be waiting till my dad didn't let me know.</v>

3322
01:28:25.291 --> 01:28:27.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll come to always happened actually.</v>

3323
01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.213
<v Speaker 1>But it was,</v>

3324
01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:28.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3325
01:28:28.491 --> 01:28:29.100
<v Speaker 1>now people say,</v>

3326
01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:31.100
<v Speaker 1>remember when we used to be able to play out there?</v>

3327
01:28:31.190 --> 01:28:31.941
<v Speaker 1>It's always happened,</v>

3328
01:28:31.941 --> 01:28:32.510
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

3329
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:33.680
<v Speaker 1>we started learning about it.</v>

3330
01:28:33.681 --> 01:28:35.300
<v Speaker 1>People started establishing patterns about it.</v>

3331
01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Then we hadn't like certain serial killers like John Wayne Gacy and,</v>

3332
01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:39.643
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

3333
01:28:39.670 --> 01:28:39.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3334
01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:41.330
<v Speaker 1>ted Bundy and stuff like that.</v>

3335
01:28:41.330 --> 01:28:43.590
<v Speaker 1>And we do.dodge bullets twice in my own life.</v>

3336
01:28:43.591 --> 01:28:45.830
<v Speaker 1>So dodged a bullet once when I was about eight years old.</v>

3337
01:28:45.831 --> 01:28:46.221
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

3338
01:28:46.221 --> 01:28:47.960
<v Speaker 1>when I was about 13 dodge a bullet.</v>

3339
01:28:47.961 --> 01:28:49.310
<v Speaker 1>You mean for guys who are trying to fuck me?</v>

3340
01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:49.840
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3341
01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3342
01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:50.601
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3343
01:28:50.601 --> 01:28:53.620
<v Speaker 1>A guy tried to take me out of a library when I was a little kid,</v>

3344
01:28:53.621 --> 01:28:55.490
<v Speaker 1>that library and starts yelling out.</v>

3345
01:28:55.610 --> 01:28:59.330
<v Speaker 1>He was gonna show me these books in his car and the library and started yelling</v>

3346
01:28:59.331 --> 01:28:59.541
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

3347
01:28:59.541 --> 01:29:00.051
<v Speaker 1>Joseph,</v>

3348
01:29:00.051 --> 01:29:01.170
<v Speaker 1>you get away from him.</v>

3349
01:29:01.171 --> 01:29:03.510
<v Speaker 1>That guy just got out of jail and I'm fucking crying.</v>

3350
01:29:03.511 --> 01:29:05.340
<v Speaker 1>And I run to her and the guy runs out of there.</v>

3351
01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:10.410
<v Speaker 1>And then another time when I was 13 some guy like literally tried to get closer</v>

3352
01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:11.850
<v Speaker 1>and closer to me and my friends.</v>

3353
01:29:11.851 --> 01:29:13.890
<v Speaker 1>He would jog around this lake that we would fish at,</v>

3354
01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:15.120
<v Speaker 1>sit down and talk to us,</v>

3355
01:29:15.121 --> 01:29:16.350
<v Speaker 1>seem like a super nice guy.</v>

3356
01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:20.610
<v Speaker 1>And then it got creepier and weirder until one day he showed up drunk.</v>

3357
01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:23.760
<v Speaker 1>He told me he loved me and that know love could be a,</v>

3358
01:29:23.761 --> 01:29:25.230
<v Speaker 1>you can't have love without sex.</v>

3359
01:29:25.231 --> 01:29:25.770
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3360
01:29:25.770 --> 01:29:26.560
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

3361
01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:28.560
<v Speaker 1>And I was 13 and I was,</v>

3362
01:29:28.650 --> 01:29:31.200
<v Speaker 1>I was skinny kid and I was hiding,</v>

3363
01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:31.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3364
01:29:31.561 --> 01:29:35.220
<v Speaker 1>we were in this area of this pond where it's like,</v>

3365
01:29:36.310 --> 01:29:36.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3366
01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:37.111
<v Speaker 1>he's a man,</v>

3367
01:29:37.111 --> 01:29:37.531
<v Speaker 1>a grow man,</v>

3368
01:29:37.531 --> 01:29:38.331
<v Speaker 1>a big man too.</v>

3369
01:29:38.331 --> 01:29:38.880
<v Speaker 1>And he wants,</v>

3370
01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:39.750
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

3371
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:40.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3372
01:29:40.171 --> 01:29:43.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm waiting for a jogger to combine and catch this guy fucking me in the ass and</v>

3373
01:29:43.651 --> 01:29:44.161
<v Speaker 1>the bushes.</v>

3374
01:29:44.161 --> 01:29:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Like what do I do so not to do.</v>

3375
01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:47.820
<v Speaker 1>I told him get the fuck away from me.</v>

3376
01:29:47.821 --> 01:29:49.620
<v Speaker 1>I put my hand in my pocket where had a knife.</v>

3377
01:29:49.621 --> 01:29:51.070
<v Speaker 1>I held onto the network as if I could do,</v>

3378
01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.710
<v Speaker 1>I never 13 year old tries to cut.</v>

3379
01:29:52.710 --> 01:29:53.910
<v Speaker 1>You cut that Dick though.</v>

3380
01:29:53.970 --> 01:29:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he didn't grab your arms first.</v>

3381
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't strong.</v>

3382
01:29:58.520 --> 01:29:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I was super volt.</v>

3383
01:29:59.850 --> 01:30:04.850
<v Speaker 1>But my point is I got lucky and dodge two bullets in my life and they weren't</v>

3384
01:30:04.981 --> 01:30:05.581
<v Speaker 1>bad bullets.</v>

3385
01:30:05.581 --> 01:30:09.150
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like some Guy Corps formed me and threw me in a van fuck and he asked</v>

3386
01:30:09.151 --> 01:30:09.720
<v Speaker 1>for a month.</v>

3387
01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:10.350
<v Speaker 1>That's scary.</v>

3388
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:11.020
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

3389
01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:12.840
<v Speaker 1>it's not worst case scenario,</v>

3390
01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:16.380
<v Speaker 1>but it was enough to know what those things are real and they're out there.</v>

3391
01:30:16.381 --> 01:30:17.400
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of my buddy,</v>

3392
01:30:17.410 --> 01:30:18.600
<v Speaker 1>my buddy got a,</v>

3393
01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:20.910
<v Speaker 1>from the age of nine to 12,</v>

3394
01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:26.160
<v Speaker 1>this guy was just this master manipulator and he ended up like getting</v>

3395
01:30:26.490 --> 01:30:29.760
<v Speaker 1>essentially rate from nine to 12 and he was their neighbor.</v>

3396
01:30:29.761 --> 01:30:30.241
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

3397
01:30:30.241 --> 01:30:30.960
<v Speaker 1>he lived,</v>

3398
01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:31.501
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

3399
01:30:31.501 --> 01:30:32.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3400
01:30:32.190 --> 01:30:33.420
<v Speaker 1>probably 25,</v>

3401
01:30:33.421 --> 01:30:33.721
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3402
01:30:33.721 --> 01:30:37.410
<v Speaker 1>And he lived and he did work around the place and he would,</v>

3403
01:30:37.411 --> 01:30:41.340
<v Speaker 1>he was really good at was he got my friend to,</v>

3404
01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:42.673
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3405
01:30:42.930 --> 01:30:45.600
<v Speaker 1>like he created a sympathetic character.</v>

3406
01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:47.490
<v Speaker 1>So my friend felt like he was like,</v>

3407
01:30:47.491 --> 01:30:47.851
<v Speaker 1>I had to,</v>

3408
01:30:47.851 --> 01:30:50.700
<v Speaker 1>I was having sex with them cause I felt like I was taking care of him otherwise</v>

3409
01:30:50.701 --> 01:30:52.770
<v Speaker 1>he would die if I didn't like he was.</v>

3410
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:53.930
<v Speaker 1>And so yes,</v>

3411
01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:54.771
<v Speaker 1>we put all the stuff on him.</v>

3412
01:30:54.771 --> 01:30:57.480
<v Speaker 1>And then what happened was he went through all that as mother.</v>

3413
01:30:57.481 --> 01:30:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Like they found out,</v>

3414
01:30:58.471 --> 01:30:58.921
<v Speaker 1>his mother said,</v>

3415
01:30:58.921 --> 01:31:00.000
<v Speaker 1>you did nothing wrong,</v>

3416
01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.440
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't know they fucking,</v>

3417
01:31:01.441 --> 01:31:02.274
<v Speaker 1>this is the 70s,</v>

3418
01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:03.623
<v Speaker 1>early eighties.</v>

3419
01:31:03.810 --> 01:31:05.130
<v Speaker 1>They go through the whole thing.</v>

3420
01:31:05.190 --> 01:31:06.720
<v Speaker 1>The Guy I think went to jail,</v>

3421
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:09.000
<v Speaker 1>but it was later,</v>

3422
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:13.020
<v Speaker 1>it was later that that trauma began to manifest itself like later on.</v>

3423
01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:14.730
<v Speaker 1>And he was never really,</v>

3424
01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:15.540
<v Speaker 1>he's never,</v>

3425
01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:16.373
<v Speaker 1>he's never,</v>

3426
01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:16.710
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3427
01:31:16.710 --> 01:31:18.420
<v Speaker 1>he's gotta be feeling gross,</v>

3428
01:31:18.600 --> 01:31:20.610
<v Speaker 1>dirty and you hate yourself.</v>

3429
01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Like he,</v>

3430
01:31:21.470 --> 01:31:23.250
<v Speaker 1>when he is he gay now,</v>

3431
01:31:23.251 --> 01:31:24.810
<v Speaker 1>but he's not gay.</v>

3432
01:31:24.811 --> 01:31:27.330
<v Speaker 1>But he was never able to,</v>

3433
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:29.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say too much cause you know,</v>

3434
01:31:29.251 --> 01:31:29.610
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3435
01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:30.070
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3436
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:31.170
<v Speaker 1>I haven't talked to him all the time,</v>

3437
01:31:31.171 --> 01:31:31.740
<v Speaker 1>but he was,</v>

3438
01:31:31.740 --> 01:31:32.431
<v Speaker 1>I was close to him.</v>

3439
01:31:32.431 --> 01:31:33.180
<v Speaker 1>You might've,</v>

3440
01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:33.990
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3441
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:35.400
<v Speaker 1>I think I've told you a little bit about,</v>

3442
01:31:35.401 --> 01:31:35.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3443
01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:35.761
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3444
01:31:35.761 --> 01:31:36.021
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

3445
01:31:36.021 --> 01:31:38.730
<v Speaker 1>he would paint was a great painter.</v>

3446
01:31:38.731 --> 01:31:42.900
<v Speaker 1>I have some of his paintings in my home and he was such a great special guy,</v>

3447
01:31:42.901 --> 01:31:43.860
<v Speaker 1>but he would know,</v>

3448
01:31:43.950 --> 01:31:45.750
<v Speaker 1>but he would paint the same thing over and over again.</v>

3449
01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:48.270
<v Speaker 1>And he never ever painted anything different.</v>

3450
01:31:48.271 --> 01:31:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Variation plus cause gut.</v>

3451
01:31:51.250 --> 01:31:52.240
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>

3452
01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:57.060
<v Speaker 1>I think humans need to pay attention to the worst aspects of our behavior.</v>

3453
01:31:57.061 --> 01:31:59.830
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that Jordan Peterson has said that I think is incredibly</v>

3454
01:31:59.831 --> 01:32:00.450
<v Speaker 1>important</v>

3455
01:32:00.450 --> 01:32:03.370
<v Speaker 2>is what scares us the most about Nazis and murderers,</v>

3456
01:32:03.790 --> 01:32:05.390
<v Speaker 2>psychopaths and rapists,</v>

3457
01:32:05.391 --> 01:32:10.391
<v Speaker 2>is we are all human and giving the right set of circumstances with the right set</v>

3458
01:32:10.661 --> 01:32:13.570
<v Speaker 2>of input and the right set of genetics and the right set of environments and the</v>

3459
01:32:13.571 --> 01:32:16.600
<v Speaker 2>right set of life experiences and the right set of abuse in the household</v>

3460
01:32:16.601 --> 01:32:17.434
<v Speaker 2>growing up.</v>

3461
01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:20.020
<v Speaker 2>You could be that person too and enjoy it.</v>

3462
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3463
01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:23.070
<v Speaker 2>and when you talk to neuroscientists and,</v>

3464
01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:23.440
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

3465
01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:26.950
<v Speaker 2>and people that are actually studying how the human brain develops.</v>

3466
01:32:26.951 --> 01:32:30.670
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that Robert Sapolsky said when I had him on the podcast is</v>

3467
01:32:30.671 --> 01:32:31.960
<v Speaker 2>a really fascinating thing.</v>

3468
01:32:31.961 --> 01:32:36.520
<v Speaker 2>He said that I think in the future we are going to look back at the idea of</v>

3469
01:32:36.521 --> 01:32:41.190
<v Speaker 2>punishing someone for their actions as being so incredibly shortsighted and</v>

3470
01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:42.970
<v Speaker 2>foolhardy because what this person is,</v>

3471
01:32:42.971 --> 01:32:44.920
<v Speaker 2>when you think about the concept of determinism,</v>

3472
01:32:44.921 --> 01:32:45.390
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3473
01:32:45.390 --> 01:32:45.580
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3474
01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:49.030
<v Speaker 2>the concept of everything in your life has led you to be who you are right now.</v>

3475
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.570
<v Speaker 2>And your,</v>

3476
01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:52.270
<v Speaker 2>your idea of free will is essentially an illusion.</v>

3477
01:32:52.450 --> 01:32:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Your freewill is based on so many different factors that you have no control</v>

3478
01:32:56.201 --> 01:32:58.240
<v Speaker 2>over and they influence you to such a great,</v>

3479
01:32:58.720 --> 01:32:59.890
<v Speaker 2>such a great deal.</v>

3480
01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:03.460
<v Speaker 2>The idea that this person is in this terrible situation that does this terrible</v>

3481
01:33:03.461 --> 01:33:06.810
<v Speaker 2>crime is just acting out of evil intentions is,</v>

3482
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:10.390
<v Speaker 2>is it's a foolish way of understanding how the human brain develops.</v>

3483
01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3484
01:33:10.890 --> 01:33:11.651
<v Speaker 2>What's he say that,</v>

3485
01:33:11.651 --> 01:33:13.150
<v Speaker 2>how would you treat those people?</v>

3486
01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:14.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a very good question and no one's,</v>

3487
01:33:14.830 --> 01:33:15.820
<v Speaker 2>no one's answered that.</v>

3488
01:33:15.821 --> 01:33:17.480
<v Speaker 2>Back in the day when somebody had an epileptic seizure,</v>

3489
01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:18.700
<v Speaker 2>epileptic seizure,</v>

3490
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.571
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3491
01:33:19.571 --> 01:33:20.140
<v Speaker 2>you were,</v>

3492
01:33:20.140 --> 01:33:22.630
<v Speaker 2>you are thought to have been possessed by a demon.</v>

3493
01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:24.130
<v Speaker 2>If you hit somebody,</v>

3494
01:33:24.131 --> 01:33:24.550
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

3495
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.880
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

3496
01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:25.270
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

3497
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:26.530
<v Speaker 2>you would be held accountable to that.</v>

3498
01:33:26.531 --> 01:33:28.690
<v Speaker 2>But what I thought was fascinating was a world war one.</v>

3499
01:33:28.691 --> 01:33:33.691
<v Speaker 2>Dan Carlin talks about this as well in world war one when they didn't know what</v>

3500
01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:38.770
<v Speaker 2>kind of concussion the bombs and their concussion would do to a soldier over and</v>

3501
01:33:38.771 --> 01:33:40.990
<v Speaker 2>over and sleep deprivation living in those trenches.</v>

3502
01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:45.070
<v Speaker 2>And what happened was some people would just begin to go into shock.</v>

3503
01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:49.150
<v Speaker 2>They would get shell shocked and so you could see them,</v>

3504
01:33:49.330 --> 01:33:52.630
<v Speaker 2>their bodies would start to constrict and they couldn't really move.</v>

3505
01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:54.490
<v Speaker 2>But back in the day,</v>

3506
01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:59.500
<v Speaker 2>those guys would be brought out and shot for cowardice because they were being</v>

3507
01:33:59.501 --> 01:34:00.430
<v Speaker 2>cowards.</v>

3508
01:34:00.490 --> 01:34:01.270
<v Speaker 2>They weren't,</v>

3509
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:02.680
<v Speaker 2>and you could see their bodies.</v>

3510
01:34:02.681 --> 01:34:05.630
<v Speaker 2>We're actually manifesting right to,</v>

3511
01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:09.640
<v Speaker 2>of like the problem with drafting and army are requiring people to sign up,</v>

3512
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:10.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3513
01:34:10.141 --> 01:34:13.180
<v Speaker 2>or making it some sort of a cultural mandate is there's some people that are</v>

3514
01:34:13.181 --> 01:34:14.450
<v Speaker 2>just not designed for,</v>

3515
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:16.060
<v Speaker 2>they can't handle pressure.</v>

3516
01:34:16.090 --> 01:34:16.923
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3517
01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:19.810
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that just can't handle fucking pressure period.</v>

3518
01:34:19.811 --> 01:34:20.860
<v Speaker 2>And for whatever reason,</v>

3519
01:34:20.861 --> 01:34:22.210
<v Speaker 2>whether it's biological,</v>

3520
01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.650
<v Speaker 2>whether it's environmental,</v>

3521
01:34:23.651 --> 01:34:25.870
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a combination of nature and nurture,</v>

3522
01:34:25.871 --> 01:34:26.441
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

3523
01:34:26.441 --> 01:34:30.280
<v Speaker 2>But there's some people that just as of right now there,</v>

3524
01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:31.133
<v Speaker 2>they just can't do it.</v>

3525
01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:31.931
<v Speaker 2>They just cannot.</v>

3526
01:34:31.931 --> 01:34:32.770
<v Speaker 2>They can't handle pressure.</v>

3527
01:34:32.771 --> 01:34:33.341
<v Speaker 2>Also also,</v>

3528
01:34:33.341 --> 01:34:34.174
<v Speaker 2>there's also this,</v>

3529
01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:35.050
<v Speaker 2>there's injury.</v>

3530
01:34:35.051 --> 01:34:39.030
<v Speaker 2>There's also a more constant sleep deprivation injury that nobody can handle.</v>

3531
01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:41.730
<v Speaker 2>And the shock of impacts near you.</v>

3532
01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:42.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3533
01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:42.701
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

3534
01:34:42.701 --> 01:34:44.680
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot that happens to people and the,</v>

3535
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:45.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3536
01:34:45.311 --> 01:34:48.550
<v Speaker 2>obviously the psychological trauma of it all and knowing that at any,</v>

3537
01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:50.320
<v Speaker 2>any step you could step on a landmine.</v>

3538
01:34:50.340 --> 01:34:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Any step,</v>

3539
01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:52.330
<v Speaker 2>you catch a bullet in the head and he's tab.</v>

3540
01:34:52.530 --> 01:34:53.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3541
01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:55.220
<v Speaker 2>the Jordan said something else that was interesting.</v>

3542
01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:57.830
<v Speaker 2>He's helped people with PTSD when</v>

3543
01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:01.190
<v Speaker 3>they come back from a war and they were from Iowa and they had a very sort of</v>

3544
01:35:01.191 --> 01:35:03.290
<v Speaker 3>linear notion of was first of all of the military.</v>

3545
01:35:03.291 --> 01:35:03.980
<v Speaker 3>I want to be,</v>

3546
01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:04.940
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a man.</v>

3547
01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:05.630
<v Speaker 3>I wanna,</v>

3548
01:35:05.630 --> 01:35:07.310
<v Speaker 3>I wanna I want to do the right thing.</v>

3549
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:08.323
<v Speaker 3>Duty,</v>

3550
01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:08.900
<v Speaker 3>honor,</v>

3551
01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:09.441
<v Speaker 3>loyalty,</v>

3552
01:35:09.441 --> 01:35:10.850
<v Speaker 3>these linear concepts,</v>

3553
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:13.550
<v Speaker 3>of course you get into war and all of that gets shattered.</v>

3554
01:35:13.551 --> 01:35:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it might even get mocked just because there's the fog of war.</v>

3555
01:35:16.941 --> 01:35:20.510
<v Speaker 3>There's so many things you do and some of these guys end up doing things that</v>

3556
01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:25.810
<v Speaker 3>are to them or because of the circumstances may be inexplicably cruel or just</v>

3557
01:35:25.851 --> 01:35:30.851
<v Speaker 3>they did something that they can't live down and he would always kind of help</v>

3558
01:35:31.071 --> 01:35:36.071
<v Speaker 3>them see that human beings being the bipolar ape that we are are capable of</v>

3559
01:35:37.761 --> 01:35:42.380
<v Speaker 3>incredible kindness and and beautiful construction and of course on the other</v>

3560
01:35:42.381 --> 01:35:43.730
<v Speaker 3>side of that,</v>

3561
01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:48.820
<v Speaker 3>you have in you the ability to do unspeakable violence and terrible destruction</v>

3562
01:35:49.461 --> 01:35:51.110
<v Speaker 3>for its own sake and oh,</v>

3563
01:35:51.111 --> 01:35:51.681
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

3564
01:35:51.681 --> 01:35:53.390
<v Speaker 3>in the moment to enjoy it.</v>

3565
01:35:53.690 --> 01:35:55.040
<v Speaker 3>That's being a human being.</v>

3566
01:35:55.041 --> 01:35:56.780
<v Speaker 3>We're fucking complicated men,</v>

3567
01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:57.753
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

3568
01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:59.270
<v Speaker 3>That's also how we got here.</v>

3569
01:35:59.290 --> 01:35:59.530
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3570
01:35:59.530 --> 01:36:02.570
<v Speaker 3>The only way you get from the wild Ayp swinging for the fuck threw the fucking</v>

3571
01:36:02.571 --> 01:36:07.430
<v Speaker 3>trees in the jungle to 2017 with your Tesla driving you down the street without</v>

3572
01:36:07.431 --> 01:36:08.750
<v Speaker 3>you even touching the steering wheel.</v>

3573
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:10.790
<v Speaker 3>The only way you get to that is through aggression.</v>

3574
01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3575
01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:12.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean it sounds crazy,</v>

3576
01:36:12.291 --> 01:36:15.950
<v Speaker 3>but you get to that through aggression and competition because if you don't have</v>

3577
01:36:15.951 --> 01:36:16.400
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

3578
01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:18.050
<v Speaker 3>that ability to survive,</v>

3579
01:36:18.170 --> 01:36:19.760
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to get past the Jaguars.</v>

3580
01:36:19.761 --> 01:36:20.760
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to get past the,</v>

3581
01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.370
<v Speaker 3>the invading tribes,</v>

3582
01:36:22.371 --> 01:36:22.851
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to get.</v>

3583
01:36:22.851 --> 01:36:24.950
<v Speaker 3>So you don't need that today.</v>

3584
01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:26.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you need it today,</v>

3585
01:36:26.391 --> 01:36:31.340
<v Speaker 3>but the only reason why we got out of those terrible situations is because we</v>

3586
01:36:31.341 --> 01:36:36.230
<v Speaker 3>have the ability to become that monster that defends itself or that monster that</v>

3587
01:36:36.231 --> 01:36:37.670
<v Speaker 3>attacks for its own interests.</v>

3588
01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:40.040
<v Speaker 3>That's literally what facilitated us developing.</v>

3589
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.281
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3590
01:36:40.281 --> 01:36:43.700
<v Speaker 3>And also the fact that development requires a certain amount of destruction in,</v>

3591
01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:46.130
<v Speaker 3>in terms of like I did this podcast with him,</v>

3592
01:36:46.131 --> 01:36:47.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to drop soon on mixed marital arts.</v>

3593
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:49.700
<v Speaker 3>And W he,</v>

3594
01:36:49.710 --> 01:36:51.410
<v Speaker 3>he said something cause somebody who wrote this article,</v>

3595
01:36:51.411 --> 01:36:54.860
<v Speaker 3>this woman and professor wrote this article about how certain speeches violent.</v>

3596
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:59.300
<v Speaker 3>Because when you say something that I disagree with or that hurts my</v>

3597
01:36:59.301 --> 01:37:00.134
<v Speaker 3>sensibilities,</v>

3598
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:03.950
<v Speaker 3>it puts me in a state of stress and that would be violence cause I,</v>

3599
01:37:04.340 --> 01:37:05.330
<v Speaker 3>and so Jordan said,</v>

3600
01:37:05.331 --> 01:37:05.631
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>

3601
01:37:05.631 --> 01:37:07.070
<v Speaker 3>let's extrapolate for a second.</v>

3602
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:08.210
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3603
01:37:08.210 --> 01:37:08.751
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>

3604
01:37:08.751 --> 01:37:10.190
<v Speaker 3>That words can pierce your heart.</v>

3605
01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:10.491
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3606
01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:10.791
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

3607
01:37:10.791 --> 01:37:12.170
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather get punched in the face.</v>

3608
01:37:12.171 --> 01:37:12.941
<v Speaker 3>You got to hear him say it,</v>

3609
01:37:12.941 --> 01:37:13.430
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3610
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:17.650
<v Speaker 3>but he said essentially the problem is it it what,</v>

3611
01:37:17.730 --> 01:37:19.370
<v Speaker 3>what about six months down the line,</v>

3612
01:37:19.371 --> 01:37:20.630
<v Speaker 3>if I am trying to get help,</v>

3613
01:37:20.631 --> 01:37:24.320
<v Speaker 3>you grow and become a better person and I see a fundamental flaw in your</v>

3614
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:25.430
<v Speaker 3>behavior,</v>

3615
01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:26.930
<v Speaker 3>in your character,</v>

3616
01:37:27.170 --> 01:37:30.110
<v Speaker 3>and I tell you if you have bad breath and you can't get a date,</v>

3617
01:37:30.111 --> 01:37:30.351
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>

3618
01:37:30.351 --> 01:37:30.561
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3619
01:37:30.561 --> 01:37:32.540
<v Speaker 3>your breath could melt paint at first.</v>

3620
01:37:32.541 --> 01:37:34.670
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be fucking embarrassing to you,</v>

3621
01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:38.240
<v Speaker 3>but you're gonna thank me six months down the line when you did something about</v>

3622
01:37:38.241 --> 01:37:38.600
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3623
01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:39.500
<v Speaker 3>More importantly,</v>

3624
01:37:39.501 --> 01:37:40.370
<v Speaker 3>if you say to somebody,</v>

3625
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:41.540
<v Speaker 3>do you want to be,</v>

3626
01:37:41.541 --> 01:37:43.460
<v Speaker 3>I hope I see you trying to be this,</v>

3627
01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:43.871
<v Speaker 3>whether it,</v>

3628
01:37:43.871 --> 01:37:44.930
<v Speaker 3>it might a great comic,</v>

3629
01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:46.161
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

3630
01:37:46.161 --> 01:37:46.610
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3631
01:37:46.610 --> 01:37:47.810
<v Speaker 3>You're not disciplined,</v>

3632
01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:48.740
<v Speaker 3>whatever it might be,</v>

3633
01:37:48.741 --> 01:37:50.290
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to hear them about an issue,</v>

3634
01:37:50.630 --> 01:37:51.463
<v Speaker 3>the truth,</v>

3635
01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:54.140
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes you have a set of beliefs,</v>

3636
01:37:54.490 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 3>a sort of built your house around</v>

3637
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.050
<v Speaker 1>this set of like sort of an ideology.</v>

3638
01:37:58.170 --> 01:38:01.230
<v Speaker 1>You think you have the truth as somebody comes along with a different idea,</v>

3639
01:38:01.530 --> 01:38:05.340
<v Speaker 1>a different point of view that shatters those walls and man,</v>

3640
01:38:05.341 --> 01:38:06.300
<v Speaker 1>you don't like it.</v>

3641
01:38:06.690 --> 01:38:08.370
<v Speaker 1>You want to go back to your safe space,</v>

3642
01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:09.870
<v Speaker 1>but good luck growing.</v>

3643
01:38:10.110 --> 01:38:13.500
<v Speaker 1>You don't get closer to the truth by fucking saying you're,</v>

3644
01:38:13.530 --> 01:38:14.660
<v Speaker 1>you're causing violence.</v>

3645
01:38:14.661 --> 01:38:17.640
<v Speaker 1>I think the real problem with this is that these people are not trying to grow.</v>

3646
01:38:17.641 --> 01:38:21.540
<v Speaker 1>The people that are trying to change the definitions of words to suit their own</v>

3647
01:38:21.541 --> 01:38:22.141
<v Speaker 1>intentions.</v>

3648
01:38:22.141 --> 01:38:25.410
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to have the option and it's not by chance.</v>

3649
01:38:25.411 --> 01:38:27.840
<v Speaker 1>The the same people that support Marxists ideologies,</v>

3650
01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:29.370
<v Speaker 1>they don't want competition.</v>

3651
01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:31.170
<v Speaker 1>They want a lack of competition.</v>

3652
01:38:31.250 --> 01:38:32.610
<v Speaker 1>I think competition is bad.</v>

3653
01:38:33.450 --> 01:38:36.300
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of that out there because they're not good at it because they</v>

3654
01:38:36.301 --> 01:38:40.740
<v Speaker 1>don't want to face that ultimate objective view of who they really are and the</v>

3655
01:38:40.741 --> 01:38:41.760
<v Speaker 1>actual capabilities.</v>

3656
01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:45.870
<v Speaker 1>They'd rather get a bunch of fucking weird social justice Brownie points for a</v>

3657
01:38:45.871 --> 01:38:47.360
<v Speaker 1>bunch of weird things and you know,</v>

3658
01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:48.990
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of that.</v>

3659
01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:52.080
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of that you're going to and you could see those patterns and the</v>

3660
01:38:52.081 --> 01:38:52.891
<v Speaker 1>way those people talk.</v>

3661
01:38:52.891 --> 01:38:54.630
<v Speaker 1>They have very specific ways of talking.</v>

3662
01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:57.480
<v Speaker 1>You can point out very specific things that they say,</v>

3663
01:38:57.630 --> 01:38:59.170
<v Speaker 1>things that they talk about their,</v>

3664
01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:01.470
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be the first to talk about white privilege.</v>

3665
01:39:01.471 --> 01:39:04.260
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be the first to talk about trans rights and all these</v>

3666
01:39:04.261 --> 01:39:04.740
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>

3667
01:39:04.740 --> 01:39:07.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a wet and there's a way of talking,</v>

3668
01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:11.130
<v Speaker 1>an actual pattern that the way they communicate your words are violence.</v>

3669
01:39:11.190 --> 01:39:11.520
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

3670
01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:14.190
<v Speaker 1>there's literally a pattern that they've adopted,</v>

3671
01:39:14.191 --> 01:39:19.191
<v Speaker 1>a predetermined pattern or behavior of thinking the ideology and in the way they</v>

3672
01:39:19.321 --> 01:39:19.921
<v Speaker 1>communicate.</v>

3673
01:39:19.921 --> 01:39:21.570
<v Speaker 1>So they all know that they're on the same team.</v>

3674
01:39:21.610 --> 01:39:23.160
<v Speaker 1>It's called owning your impact,</v>

3675
01:39:23.161 --> 01:39:24.090
<v Speaker 1>your verbal impact,</v>

3676
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.800
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

3677
01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:26.190
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

3678
01:39:26.190 --> 01:39:29.400
<v Speaker 1>there's a pattern to the way the noises come out of their mouth.</v>

3679
01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.470
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating because there's so,</v>

3680
01:39:31.890 --> 01:39:33.330
<v Speaker 1>there's so uniform,</v>

3681
01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:36.090
<v Speaker 1>it's so common to hear these people talk the same way.</v>

3682
01:39:36.091 --> 01:39:39.930
<v Speaker 1>When Jordan Peterson got in this debate on television with this,</v>

3683
01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:45.180
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a man and I say it in the same way that they in them or pronouns.</v>

3684
01:39:45.181 --> 01:39:46.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to be negative.</v>

3685
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:49.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is a man or a woman because she's clearly,</v>

3686
01:39:49.740 --> 01:39:51.480
<v Speaker 1>he's clearly Uber feminine,</v>

3687
01:39:51.630 --> 01:39:55.500
<v Speaker 1>but has a beard and says there is no biological difference in gender.</v>

3688
01:39:55.660 --> 01:39:58.900
<v Speaker 1>He sort of Medicine University of Toronto.</v>

3689
01:39:58.930 --> 01:39:59.401
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>

3690
01:39:59.401 --> 01:39:59.551
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3691
01:39:59.551 --> 01:40:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I'd be happy to unpack that for you.</v>

3692
01:40:00.811 --> 01:40:01.644
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

3693
01:40:01.890 --> 01:40:02.190
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3694
01:40:02.190 --> 01:40:02.401
<v Speaker 1>x,</v>

3695
01:40:02.401 --> 01:40:03.360
<v Speaker 1>y chromosomes.</v>

3696
01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:04.380
<v Speaker 1>If you could find that,</v>

3697
01:40:04.381 --> 01:40:07.530
<v Speaker 1>see if you could just find that guy saying to Jordan Peterson,</v>

3698
01:40:07.531 --> 01:40:10.710
<v Speaker 1>he was no biological basis for gender.</v>

3699
01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:14.490
<v Speaker 1>They were trying to force some under penalty of law and fine or whatever,</v>

3700
01:40:14.491 --> 01:40:15.324
<v Speaker 1>and jail,</v>

3701
01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:15.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3702
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:17.010
<v Speaker 1>to use,</v>

3703
01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:19.590
<v Speaker 1>to not use someone's preferred Pronoun,</v>

3704
01:40:19.710 --> 01:40:22.110
<v Speaker 1>which I would do just because I don't want to hurt somebody's feelings,</v>

3705
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:24.060
<v Speaker 1>but they're trying to pass and it's law.</v>

3706
01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:27.180
<v Speaker 1>So if you didn't use Xer or whatever,</v>

3707
01:40:27.210 --> 01:40:31.340
<v Speaker 1>you would be a gender Pronoun tries in Toronto.</v>

3708
01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3709
01:40:31.870 --> 01:40:33.240
<v Speaker 1>It'd be tried for,</v>

3710
01:40:33.270 --> 01:40:33.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3711
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:35.340
<v Speaker 1>you'd be tried for hate speech.</v>

3712
01:40:36.570 --> 01:40:38.070
<v Speaker 1>And that's where we had,</v>

3713
01:40:38.190 --> 01:40:38.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3714
01:40:38.491 --> 01:40:39.690
<v Speaker 1>with that Communists,</v>

3715
01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:40.400
<v Speaker 1>they always,</v>

3716
01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:44.460
<v Speaker 1>comics was of true religion in the Soviet Union and they had essentially</v>

3717
01:40:44.461 --> 01:40:47.010
<v Speaker 1>clergymen people who were sort of,</v>

3718
01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:47.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3719
01:40:47.970 --> 01:40:48.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3720
01:40:48.730 --> 01:40:50.610
<v Speaker 1>at the purest form of a priest.</v>

3721
01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:53.530
<v Speaker 1>The idea that somebody would go around and check with the soldiers to make sure</v>

3722
01:40:53.531 --> 01:40:54.550
<v Speaker 1>that their piety,</v>

3723
01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:57.940
<v Speaker 1>that their allegiance to the communist cause was intact.</v>

3724
01:40:57.941 --> 01:41:01.680
<v Speaker 1>And they'd ask you questions or other cultures having these problems where these</v>

3725
01:41:01.730 --> 01:41:04.000
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] coming up and all that stuff.</v>

3726
01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:04.451
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3727
01:41:04.451 --> 01:41:07.060
<v Speaker 1>it's happening pro down at us happening in America.</v>

3728
01:41:07.061 --> 01:41:09.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's probably happening in different ways.</v>

3729
01:41:09.171 --> 01:41:13.030
<v Speaker 1>It happened in like Europe and Brazil and in the 20th century it was called</v>

3730
01:41:13.060 --> 01:41:13.721
<v Speaker 1>Fascism.</v>

3731
01:41:13.721 --> 01:41:14.890
<v Speaker 1>It was called communism.</v>

3732
01:41:15.220 --> 01:41:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Human beings love religion.</v>

3733
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:19.540
<v Speaker 1>We're all religious.</v>

3734
01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:21.010
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

3735
01:41:21.011 --> 01:41:21.770
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

3736
01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:24.580
<v Speaker 1>there are manmade religion and other religions that are,</v>

3737
01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:25.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3738
01:41:25.420 --> 01:41:28.750
<v Speaker 1>at least purported to be from on high,</v>

3739
01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:30.310
<v Speaker 1>at least with on high religions,</v>

3740
01:41:30.311 --> 01:41:31.450
<v Speaker 1>they're rather fixed.</v>

3741
01:41:31.451 --> 01:41:35.010
<v Speaker 1>It seems that manmade religions tend to be more ideologies.</v>

3742
01:41:35.450 --> 01:41:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3743
01:41:36.010 --> 01:41:37.330
<v Speaker 1>and the difference between those,</v>

3744
01:41:37.331 --> 01:41:37.691
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

3745
01:41:37.691 --> 01:41:38.510
<v Speaker 1>his philosophy,</v>

3746
01:41:38.510 --> 01:41:41.830
<v Speaker 1>something that's trying to get to the truth with logic and reason and debate</v>

3747
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:43.060
<v Speaker 1>etiologies.</v>

3748
01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:44.200
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for debate.</v>

3749
01:41:44.201 --> 01:41:45.130
<v Speaker 1>It goes back to what you were saying.</v>

3750
01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:46.240
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for debate.</v>

3751
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:47.650
<v Speaker 1>We have the answers,</v>

3752
01:41:47.651 --> 01:41:48.484
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

3753
01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:50.350
<v Speaker 1>that is equality in all costs.</v>

3754
01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:50.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3755
01:41:50.651 --> 01:41:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I'd be happy to impact that for you.</v>

3756
01:41:52.330 --> 01:41:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3757
01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:53.411
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

3758
01:41:53.411 --> 01:41:54.210
<v Speaker 1>To have that video.</v>

3759
01:41:54.210 --> 01:41:56.080
<v Speaker 1>Now we'll see if we could find that.</v>

3760
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:57.143
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy will find it.</v>

3761
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I can't stand the guy but,</v>

3762
01:41:59.051 --> 01:42:01.450
<v Speaker 1>but it was a bizarre conversation because it's like,</v>

3763
01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:01.871
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3764
01:42:01.871 --> 01:42:02.650
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're doing.</v>

3765
01:42:02.650 --> 01:42:06.220
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to reinvent reality and there's a bunch of people that support</v>

3766
01:42:06.221 --> 01:42:06.600
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

3767
01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:09.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of other people that are delusional and there also right there</v>

3768
01:42:09.131 --> 01:42:11.050
<v Speaker 1>with you trying to reinvent reality.</v>

3769
01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Is there a,</v>

3770
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:12.940
<v Speaker 1>is there a huge movement?</v>

3771
01:42:12.941 --> 01:42:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Like is this a big thing?</v>

3772
01:42:14.410 --> 01:42:16.180
<v Speaker 1>There's enough that people were talking about it.</v>

3773
01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:17.830
<v Speaker 1>The thing about losing morale too though.</v>

3774
01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:18.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3775
01:42:18.131 --> 01:42:18.950
<v Speaker 1>of course they are.</v>

3776
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Course there's not enough people.</v>

3777
01:42:21.100 --> 01:42:22.640
<v Speaker 1>There's not enough people are going to support it.</v>

3778
01:42:22.641 --> 01:42:24.200
<v Speaker 1>There's so many real Morgan to reject it.</v>

3779
01:42:24.201 --> 01:42:24.521
<v Speaker 1>It'd be like,</v>

3780
01:42:24.521 --> 01:42:25.001
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out.</v>

3781
01:42:25.001 --> 01:42:25.601
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

3782
01:42:25.601 --> 01:42:27.190
<v Speaker 1>this is not like a behavior thing.</v>

3783
01:42:27.191 --> 01:42:28.090
<v Speaker 1>This is science.</v>

3784
01:42:28.091 --> 01:42:29.450
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about chromosomes.</v>

3785
01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:31.510
<v Speaker 1>You talking about gender dysphoria,</v>

3786
01:42:31.511 --> 01:42:33.700
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about all sorts of different issues that are like,</v>

3787
01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:38.840
<v Speaker 1>these are recognized actual issues that human beings have.</v>

3788
01:42:39.010 --> 01:42:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3789
01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:40.840
<v Speaker 1>what are these issues though?</v>

3790
01:42:41.010 --> 01:42:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Are you saying there's no,</v>

3791
01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:44.560
<v Speaker 1>there's no scientific basis.</v>

3792
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:47.110
<v Speaker 1>You're saying you can't differentiate between a male and a woman,</v>

3793
01:42:47.111 --> 01:42:47.980
<v Speaker 1>a man and a female.</v>

3794
01:42:48.010 --> 01:42:49.720
<v Speaker 1>That is bizarre nonsense.</v>

3795
01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:52.750
<v Speaker 1>Of course you can make a distinction between,</v>

3796
01:42:53.050 --> 01:42:57.790
<v Speaker 1>you could make the distinction between male and female and then um,</v>

3797
01:42:58.150 --> 01:42:59.500
<v Speaker 1>he and her in a way.</v>

3798
01:42:59.501 --> 01:43:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

3799
01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:00.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3800
01:43:00.171 --> 01:43:02.250
<v Speaker 1>This is the bald one is the one who said that it okay.</v>

3801
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3802
01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3803
01:43:03.450 --> 01:43:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Well woman's in a women's studies department.</v>

3804
01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:06.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3805
01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:07.393
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>

3806
01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's not transgender.</v>

3807
01:43:10.030 --> 01:43:10.990
<v Speaker 1>The something going on.</v>

3808
01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Really</v>

3809
01:43:12.130 --> 01:43:15.550
<v Speaker 4>it's not correct that there is such a thing as biological sex.</v>

3810
01:43:15.551 --> 01:43:17.020
<v Speaker 4>And I'm a historian of medicine.</v>

3811
01:43:17.021 --> 01:43:20.050
<v Speaker 4>I can unpack that for you at grandma's fucking crazy.</v>

3812
01:43:20.051 --> 01:43:22.080
<v Speaker 4>In the interest of time I won't.</v>

3813
01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:24.430
<v Speaker 4>So that's a very popular misconception.</v>

3814
01:43:24.431 --> 01:43:25.264
<v Speaker 4>So I essentially,</v>

3815
01:43:25.390 --> 01:43:27.040
<v Speaker 4>in my transgender studies classes,</v>

3816
01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:32.020
<v Speaker 4>what we're doing is looking at actual research and identify ways that current</v>

3817
01:43:32.021 --> 01:43:36.120
<v Speaker 4>social issues related to trans people or things that are associated with trans,</v>

3818
01:43:36.121 --> 01:43:38.110
<v Speaker 4>such as free speech arguments and claims.</v>

3819
01:43:38.530 --> 01:43:39.130
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3820
01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:39.780
<v Speaker 4>hard times,</v>

3821
01:43:39.780 --> 01:43:42.640
<v Speaker 4>nice to speech arguments in a way that people are thinking in the way that</v>

3822
01:43:42.641 --> 01:43:43.630
<v Speaker 4>research has been framed,</v>

3823
01:43:43.631 --> 01:43:46.100
<v Speaker 4>the history there was some of the other prisoners area.</v>

3824
01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:50.480
<v Speaker 4>Typically I don't focus on pronouns because pronouns are actually part of a CIS</v>

3825
01:43:50.481 --> 01:43:51.380
<v Speaker 4>normative culture.</v>

3826
01:43:51.381 --> 01:43:52.100
<v Speaker 4>So what we do</v>

3827
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:52.761
<v Speaker 1>is learn about it.</v>

3828
01:43:52.761 --> 01:43:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stop you right there to explain it,</v>

3829
01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:56.810
<v Speaker 1>but we don't start from the forearm</v>

3830
01:43:58.450 --> 01:44:02.770
<v Speaker 1>to this guy's a good guy or girl that used to be a girl.</v>

3831
01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:03.740
<v Speaker 1>That's a man.</v>

3832
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:05.660
<v Speaker 1>Did it used to be a woman has a better beard than me?</v>

3833
01:44:05.661 --> 01:44:05.811
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3834
01:44:05.811 --> 01:44:06.644
<v Speaker 1>that's a man.</v>

3835
01:44:07.310 --> 01:44:08.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a man on hormones.</v>

3836
01:44:08.211 --> 01:44:11.750
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a man on a female that's on male hormone.</v>

3837
01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:11.861
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3838
01:44:11.861 --> 01:44:12.680
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>

3839
01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

3840
01:44:13.160 --> 01:44:13.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3841
01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.313
<v Speaker 1>good to hear.</v>

3842
01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you know Buck Angeles?</v>

3843
01:44:16.540 --> 01:44:16.900
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3844
01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:17.691
<v Speaker 1>Buck angels,</v>

3845
01:44:17.691 --> 01:44:22.070
<v Speaker 1>a porn star that was born a woman that became a man through hormones and she was</v>

3846
01:44:22.071 --> 01:44:22.791
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast.</v>

3847
01:44:22.791 --> 01:44:23.630
<v Speaker 1>He was on the podcast.</v>

3848
01:44:23.631 --> 01:44:23.781
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

3849
01:44:23.781 --> 01:44:26.090
<v Speaker 1>he now talks exactly like that guy.</v>

3850
01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Sounds just like him.</v>

3851
01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:30.290
<v Speaker 1>That guy right there that's born a woman born a woman.</v>

3852
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3853
01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3854
01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:34.430
<v Speaker 1>but just play a clip of him on the podcast.</v>

3855
01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:36.170
<v Speaker 1>This is what I want you to hear.</v>

3856
01:44:36.171 --> 01:44:41.171
<v Speaker 1>I want you to hear the way he sounds because he sounds literally exactly like</v>

3857
01:44:41.181 --> 01:44:41.691
<v Speaker 1>that guy.</v>

3858
01:44:41.691 --> 01:44:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Like he could be doing an impression of that guy.</v>

3859
01:44:44.350 --> 01:44:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Look at it is all jacked and yoke to shit.</v>

3860
01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Get along.</v>

3861
01:44:47.570 --> 01:44:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Goes is a couple of years ago,</v>

3862
01:44:49.371 --> 01:44:51.170
<v Speaker 1>I want to say a hundred thousand years ago,</v>

3863
01:44:51.171 --> 01:44:55.030
<v Speaker 1>200,000 years ago when we were women and a run,</v>

3864
01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:56.240
<v Speaker 1>two women had a fight.</v>

3865
01:44:56.241 --> 01:44:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Two women had to stay alive.</v>

3866
01:44:57.771 --> 01:45:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Women had to protect their babies and they didn't have to do it as much or often</v>

3867
01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:03.170
<v Speaker 1>get to him and get to him.</v>

3868
01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:05.083
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3869
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:09.080
<v Speaker 1>And they'll be less likely to stick around and raise their children cannot</v>

3870
01:45:09.081 --> 01:45:09.914
<v Speaker 1>exist,</v>

3871
01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:10.880
<v Speaker 1>but don't they?</v>

3872
01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't make sense to me.</v>

3873
01:45:12.411 --> 01:45:13.150
<v Speaker 1>The whole,</v>

3874
01:45:13.150 --> 01:45:14.510
<v Speaker 1>the whole building.</v>

3875
01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:16.820
<v Speaker 1>I used to be a female taking,</v>

3876
01:45:16.821 --> 01:45:17.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3877
01:45:17.150 --> 01:45:17.940
<v Speaker 1>let me see it before Friday.</v>

3878
01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:18.740
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing.</v>

3879
01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Let me see.</v>

3880
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.863
<v Speaker 1>Same order,</v>

3881
01:45:19.940 --> 01:45:20.773
<v Speaker 1>same voice.</v>

3882
01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:25.250
<v Speaker 1>I think that that guy is a guy who was born,</v>

3883
01:45:25.251 --> 01:45:27.980
<v Speaker 1>a woman who took me on hormones just like buck angel.</v>

3884
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you might be fucking on it,</v>

3885
01:45:30.250 --> 01:45:33.050
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that there's no biological difference,</v>

3886
01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:34.340
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see a naked picture.</v>

3887
01:45:34.341 --> 01:45:35.090
<v Speaker 1>So that's the above.</v>

3888
01:45:35.090 --> 01:45:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Let me see the the girl version.</v>

3889
01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:38.060
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have his license.</v>

3890
01:45:38.350 --> 01:45:38.750
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3891
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:39.870
<v Speaker 1>that's not what act.</v>

3892
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.731
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3893
01:45:40.731 --> 01:45:40.911
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3894
01:45:40.911 --> 01:45:41.121
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3895
01:45:41.121 --> 01:45:41.301
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3896
01:45:41.301 --> 01:45:41.840
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3897
01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:43.790
<v Speaker 1>That's not what you would see.</v>

3898
01:45:43.791 --> 01:45:46.220
<v Speaker 1>See what is the word I'm trying to look for?</v>

3899
01:45:46.221 --> 01:45:47.960
<v Speaker 1>I that him right there.</v>

3900
01:45:48.090 --> 01:45:49.370
<v Speaker 1>That was before and after it said,</v>

3901
01:45:49.460 --> 01:45:50.180
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

3902
01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:52.140
<v Speaker 1>really this,</v>

3903
01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:52.680
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3904
01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:53.241
<v Speaker 1>this makes sense.</v>

3905
01:45:53.241 --> 01:45:54.074
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel like if the,</v>

3906
01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:55.340
<v Speaker 1>if the world had my,</v>

3907
01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:59.000
<v Speaker 1>my attitude full me wait,</v>

3908
01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:01.730
<v Speaker 1>but the world at your absolute perfect.</v>

3909
01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:02.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3910
01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:02.281
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3911
01:46:02.281 --> 01:46:02.420
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3912
01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:02.961
<v Speaker 1>definitely not.</v>

3913
01:46:02.961 --> 01:46:04.640
<v Speaker 1>But I think the world that my attitude about this,</v>

3914
01:46:04.970 --> 01:46:05.840
<v Speaker 1>like even as a kid,</v>

3915
01:46:05.841 --> 01:46:10.100
<v Speaker 1>if I saw that somebody was very feminine or I saw that,</v>

3916
01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:11.690
<v Speaker 1>like say somebody was like,</v>

3917
01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:12.201
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

3918
01:46:12.201 --> 01:46:12.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3919
01:46:12.570 --> 01:46:13.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3920
01:46:13.190 --> 01:46:13.761
<v Speaker 1>I'm a woman,</v>

3921
01:46:13.761 --> 01:46:18.260
<v Speaker 1>but I want to be a man or a man with a protected that person and more important</v>

3922
01:46:18.261 --> 01:46:18.800
<v Speaker 1>they've been doing it.</v>

3923
01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I think I would've gone out of my way to make no big deal about it and they</v>

3924
01:46:22.251 --> 01:46:23.061
<v Speaker 1>would have been included.</v>

3925
01:46:23.061 --> 01:46:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3926
01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:23.750
<v Speaker 1>but that's not,</v>

3927
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:24.620
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about you.</v>

3928
01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:29.300
<v Speaker 1>I talking about that sort of conversation is a nonsense conversation and this is</v>

3929
01:46:29.301 --> 01:46:32.360
<v Speaker 1>going on over and over and over again because those people are going to call</v>

3930
01:46:32.570 --> 01:46:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Eric Weinstein was on my podcast.</v>

3931
01:46:34.090 --> 01:46:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Winestein sorry.</v>

3932
01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3933
01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:36.980
<v Speaker 1>not like Harvey Weinstein.</v>

3934
01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Eric Weinstein brother Bret Weinstein was on my podcast and he said,</v>

3935
01:46:40.851 --> 01:46:42.290
<v Speaker 1>here's how you know when you're in a cult,</v>

3936
01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:45.980
<v Speaker 1>when you hear there is no biological difference between men and women.</v>

3937
01:46:46.130 --> 01:46:48.440
<v Speaker 1>You're in a cult that's called [inaudible],</v>

3938
01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:48.830
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

3939
01:46:48.830 --> 01:46:50.190
<v Speaker 1>who's that are common</v>

3940
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:51.190
<v Speaker 2>in colleges today.</v>

3941
01:46:51.460 --> 01:46:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Colleges today,</v>

3942
01:46:52.530 --> 01:46:54.240
<v Speaker 2>you're hearing it left and right and a major,</v>

3943
01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:54.900
<v Speaker 2>a major call,</v>

3944
01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:56.790
<v Speaker 2>major universities in America.</v>

3945
01:46:56.791 --> 01:46:57.090
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3946
01:46:57.090 --> 01:46:57.923
<v Speaker 2>in America,</v>

3947
01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:58.191
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

3948
01:46:58.191 --> 01:47:00.990
<v Speaker 2>they're teaching this and people were afraid to correct them.</v>

3949
01:47:00.991 --> 01:47:01.320
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3950
01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:03.150
<v Speaker 2>They're afraid to say anything different about it.</v>

3951
01:47:03.151 --> 01:47:03.351
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3952
01:47:03.351 --> 01:47:04.590
<v Speaker 2>and that's exactly right.</v>

3953
01:47:04.591 --> 01:47:05.460
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

3954
01:47:05.461 --> 01:47:09.330
<v Speaker 2>if you even say gender dysmorphia was cause for you as far as,</v>

3955
01:47:09.331 --> 01:47:09.541
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

3956
01:47:09.541 --> 01:47:12.540
<v Speaker 2>it was considered a mental illness for a long time.</v>

3957
01:47:13.020 --> 01:47:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Even to suggest that that may be us,</v>

3958
01:47:16.710 --> 01:47:18.300
<v Speaker 2>a subset of the population.</v>

3959
01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's worth it.</v>

3960
01:47:19.661 --> 01:47:20.041
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't.</v>

3961
01:47:20.041 --> 01:47:21.320
<v Speaker 2>You have a child maybe.</v>

3962
01:47:21.570 --> 01:47:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Well if you have a child who's thinking of themselves,</v>

3963
01:47:24.241 --> 01:47:24.361
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3964
01:47:24.361 --> 01:47:24.481
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3965
01:47:24.481 --> 01:47:25.141
<v Speaker 2>there are people,</v>

3966
01:47:25.141 --> 01:47:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood actors that are having their children.</v>

3967
01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:28.313
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3968
01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:29.400
<v Speaker 2>from what I have heard,</v>

3969
01:47:29.401 --> 01:47:30.450
<v Speaker 2>having seen this,</v>

3970
01:47:30.630 --> 01:47:34.770
<v Speaker 2>what I've heard from people that I know their kids are going through,</v>

3971
01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:36.270
<v Speaker 2>they're getting horrible.</v>

3972
01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:38.880
<v Speaker 2>I think hormone blockers.</v>

3973
01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Owen Benjamin got a shit load of trouble for talking about a guy who has a three</v>

3974
01:47:43.981 --> 01:47:44.490
<v Speaker 2>year old.</v>

3975
01:47:44.490 --> 01:47:47.040
<v Speaker 2>That's how he's putting through a hormonal blockers.</v>

3976
01:47:47.041 --> 01:47:50.870
<v Speaker 2>And he was talking about how fucking insane that people were barring owned</v>

3977
01:47:50.871 --> 01:47:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin from war.</v>

3978
01:47:51.761 --> 01:47:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Are you kidding?</v>

3979
01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:52.861
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

01:47:52.861 --> 01:47:53.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

3981
01:47:53.250 --> 01:47:54.570
<v Speaker 2>My own bedroom and guy,</v>

3982
01:47:54.571 --> 01:47:55.020
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

3983
01:47:55.020 --> 01:47:56.040
<v Speaker 2>he's just an animal.</v>

3984
01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:57.060
<v Speaker 2>They own child.</v>

3985
01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Let this child develop it's child abuse.</v>

3986
01:48:00.510 --> 01:48:03.600
<v Speaker 2>If you cracked any legit doctors who know anything about they go,</v>

3987
01:48:03.601 --> 01:48:03.961
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

3988
01:48:03.961 --> 01:48:06.600
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't be doing anything to your past 21 years old.</v>

3989
01:48:06.601 --> 01:48:10.650
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't be doing Amy then if you want to do it to each of the text is not</v>

3990
01:48:10.651 --> 01:48:15.651
<v Speaker 2>even fully developed for 25 that was one thing he talked about 25 yeah,</v>

3991
01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:18.050
<v Speaker 2>but Dave watershed date,</v>

3992
01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:22.260
<v Speaker 2>there's some kids that at a very young age are very adamant about the fact they</v>

3993
01:48:22.261 --> 01:48:23.280
<v Speaker 2>were born in the wrong body.</v>

3994
01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:23.911
<v Speaker 2>And some of them,</v>

3995
01:48:23.911 --> 01:48:24.840
<v Speaker 2>you look at them and you go,</v>

3996
01:48:24.841 --> 01:48:25.051
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3997
01:48:25.051 --> 01:48:25.650
<v Speaker 2>it makes sense,</v>

3998
01:48:25.650 --> 01:48:25.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3999
01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:28.530
<v Speaker 2>So it's like who's right and who's wrong and when do you decide?</v>

4000
01:48:28.531 --> 01:48:29.640
<v Speaker 2>But here's when you don't decide.</v>

4001
01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:31.380
<v Speaker 2>Three three is crazy.</v>

4002
01:48:31.450 --> 01:48:32.160
<v Speaker 2>He's crazy.</v>

4003
01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:32.461
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>

4004
01:48:32.461 --> 01:48:33.480
<v Speaker 2>he should be put in jail.</v>

4005
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:36.240
<v Speaker 2>There's something wrong with our culture where we think that that's a good idea</v>

4006
01:48:36.241 --> 01:48:40.650
<v Speaker 2>to interfere with the hormonal system of a very complex thing like as human</v>

4007
01:48:40.651 --> 01:48:41.070
<v Speaker 2>beings.</v>

4008
01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Three that becomes this sort of,</v>

4009
01:48:43.530 --> 01:48:43.831
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4010
01:48:43.831 --> 01:48:44.131
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4011
01:48:44.131 --> 01:48:44.690
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

4012
01:48:44.690 --> 01:48:45.390
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4013
01:48:45.390 --> 01:48:46.230
<v Speaker 2>the thing to do.</v>

4014
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Because if it was a thing that the CDC,</v>

4015
01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:49.801
<v Speaker 2>what do is,</v>

4016
01:48:49.801 --> 01:48:50.490
<v Speaker 2>what does the kin,</v>

4017
01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Canadian broadcast network,</v>

4018
01:48:51.740 --> 01:48:52.470
<v Speaker 2>CBC,</v>

4019
01:48:52.470 --> 01:48:55.110
<v Speaker 2>they didn't want to talk about a story.</v>

4020
01:48:55.111 --> 01:48:57.570
<v Speaker 2>And I tweeted this a while back to this.</v>

4021
01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:58.200
<v Speaker 2>They didn't,</v>

4022
01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:01.770
<v Speaker 2>they didn't want to have a story on about transgender children because they</v>

4023
01:49:01.771 --> 01:49:06.771
<v Speaker 2>showed that 85% of the kids that wanted to be trans after a couple of years</v>

4024
01:49:07.261 --> 01:49:08.094
<v Speaker 2>changed their mind.</v>

4025
01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:11.580
<v Speaker 2>There was a giant percentage of these kids that went through a phase.</v>

4026
01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:11.971
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4027
01:49:11.971 --> 01:49:12.661
<v Speaker 2>Ruby rose,</v>

4028
01:49:12.661 --> 01:49:13.620
<v Speaker 2>that famous actress,</v>

4029
01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:14.760
<v Speaker 2>I think she's a lesbian.</v>

4030
01:49:14.761 --> 01:49:15.240
<v Speaker 2>She's got,</v>

4031
01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:16.073
<v Speaker 2>it's really pretty.</v>

4032
01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.330
<v Speaker 2>She was in that John Wick two moving.</v>

4033
01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:22.320
<v Speaker 2>She said that when she was young that she had thought about being trans and</v>

4034
01:49:22.321 --> 01:49:25.170
<v Speaker 2>she's really happy that she didn't actually go through it with the hormones and</v>

4035
01:49:25.171 --> 01:49:28.720
<v Speaker 2>everything and now she realizes this is just shown she just doesn't fit in.</v>

4036
01:49:28.721 --> 01:49:29.700
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people don't,</v>

4037
01:49:29.701 --> 01:49:33.840
<v Speaker 2>they don't fit into what society has in line for them in terms of a man or a</v>

4038
01:49:33.841 --> 01:49:34.111
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

4039
01:49:34.111 --> 01:49:36.060
<v Speaker 2>This binary one or zero,</v>

4040
01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:36.990
<v Speaker 2>this old school.</v>

4041
01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:38.730
<v Speaker 2>I also think that makes sense too.</v>

4042
01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:39.630
<v Speaker 2>I also think a lot of the,</v>

4043
01:49:39.660 --> 01:49:40.493
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4044
01:49:40.570 --> 01:49:44.550
<v Speaker 2>the activism came out of a good place,</v>

4045
01:49:44.551 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 2>which was that a lot at 40% of people</v>

4046
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:48.843
<v Speaker 1>who have trans,</v>

4047
01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:51.070
<v Speaker 1>a Trans Morphea,</v>

4048
01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:52.053
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

4049
01:49:52.210 --> 01:49:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Gender dysphoria.</v>

4050
01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:53.950
<v Speaker 1>You gotta get that right?</v>

4051
01:49:53.980 --> 01:49:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

4052
01:49:54.740 --> 01:49:56.240
<v Speaker 1>40% of the thing.</v>

4053
01:49:56.260 --> 01:49:58.210
<v Speaker 1>You don't even commit that commit suicide.</v>

4054
01:49:58.300 --> 01:49:58.391
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4055
01:49:58.391 --> 01:50:00.640
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing you're not even supposed to be doing by the way.</v>

4056
01:50:00.641 --> 01:50:02.890
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have anything to do with whether or not they have had surgery even</v>

4057
01:50:02.900 --> 01:50:03.461
<v Speaker 1>ask you that.</v>

4058
01:50:03.461 --> 01:50:04.294
<v Speaker 1>I was going to ask you that.</v>

4059
01:50:04.450 --> 01:50:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I heard that after they have the surgery.</v>

4060
01:50:06.671 --> 01:50:07.330
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

4061
01:50:07.330 --> 01:50:09.550
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't actually change in that.</v>

4062
01:50:09.930 --> 01:50:10.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4063
01:50:10.150 --> 01:50:10.983
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

4064
01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:12.520
<v Speaker 1>But the question is,</v>

4065
01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:13.330
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

4066
01:50:13.330 --> 01:50:16.560
<v Speaker 1>are they depressed because they haven't been accepted but accepted as who's,</v>

4067
01:50:16.630 --> 01:50:17.800
<v Speaker 1>who's who they really are.</v>

4068
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4069
01:50:19.090 --> 01:50:22.960
<v Speaker 1>And how society caused them to have these irreparable scars and that's what's</v>

4070
01:50:22.961 --> 01:50:24.610
<v Speaker 1>led them to commit suicide ultimately.</v>

4071
01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:27.370
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't fixed by the surgery.</v>

4072
01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible too?</v>

4073
01:50:28.930 --> 01:50:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that we could be more accepting as a society and as a culture?</v>

4074
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:35.500
<v Speaker 1>And then these people could just be whoever the fuck they want to be.</v>

4075
01:50:35.710 --> 01:50:36.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's all right too.</v>

4076
01:50:36.641 --> 01:50:40.240
<v Speaker 1>And maybe we would have a lower suicide rate if it wasn't thought of with this</v>

4077
01:50:40.570 --> 01:50:41.403
<v Speaker 1>great stigma.</v>

4078
01:50:41.590 --> 01:50:45.280
<v Speaker 1>But you're not going to fix that by having people like that go on TV and say</v>

4079
01:50:45.281 --> 01:50:47.570
<v Speaker 1>something that's a blatant scientific lock.</v>

4080
01:50:47.620 --> 01:50:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Like I sick in the head,</v>

4081
01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:52.270
<v Speaker 1>like I should not be educating young mind and people are coming out of those</v>

4082
01:50:52.271 --> 01:50:52.780
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>

4083
01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of people every day are coming out adopting and these are called</v>

4084
01:50:56.431 --> 01:51:00.430
<v Speaker 1>cheese and cause my son date rebel against their parents and their parents might</v>

4085
01:51:00.431 --> 01:51:03.730
<v Speaker 1>be some fucking right wing square jawed knucklehead,</v>

4086
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:04.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4087
01:51:04.241 --> 01:51:08.350
<v Speaker 1>that has some stupid ideas about what a man is and what a woman is.</v>

4088
01:51:08.351 --> 01:51:08.701
<v Speaker 1>And it is.</v>

4089
01:51:08.701 --> 01:51:09.521
<v Speaker 1>And God says,</v>

4090
01:51:09.521 --> 01:51:11.080
<v Speaker 1>man shall not lawyer Dude,</v>

4091
01:51:11.081 --> 01:51:16.081
<v Speaker 1>studios and directors get massive heat for not having transgender actors and</v>

4092
01:51:18.341 --> 01:51:19.480
<v Speaker 1>stars and all that.</v>

4093
01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:20.890
<v Speaker 1>And there's this index.</v>

4094
01:51:21.070 --> 01:51:24.100
<v Speaker 1>How many lines did women save versus how many lines in men,</v>

4095
01:51:24.130 --> 01:51:27.460
<v Speaker 1>how many female strong characters are right?</v>

4096
01:51:28.330 --> 01:51:29.350
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing you do.</v>

4097
01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:30.131
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about this,</v>

4098
01:51:30.131 --> 01:51:30.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4102
01:51:32.871 --> 01:51:35.240
<v Speaker 1>and they were talking about inclusivity and about,</v>

4103
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:37.000
<v Speaker 1>is it on time now I forget.</v>

4104
01:51:37.001 --> 01:51:38.260
<v Speaker 1>Vanity Fair or something like that.</v>

4105
01:51:38.270 --> 01:51:38.681
<v Speaker 1>It's different.</v>

4106
01:51:38.681 --> 01:51:39.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a different magazines.</v>

4107
01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:40.950
<v Speaker 1>It was all white.</v>

4108
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:41.181
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4109
01:51:41.181 --> 01:51:42.014
<v Speaker 1>But it's all white.</v>

4110
01:51:42.590 --> 01:51:43.990
<v Speaker 1>All white women.</v>

4111
01:51:43.991 --> 01:51:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Like how has this diversity,</v>

4112
01:51:45.810 --> 01:51:46.990
<v Speaker 1>like you're all white women,</v>

4113
01:51:46.991 --> 01:51:48.670
<v Speaker 1>you're not even playing by your own rules.</v>

4114
01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:49.541
<v Speaker 1>A lot of shit for it.</v>

4115
01:51:49.541 --> 01:51:50.890
<v Speaker 1>They should get a lot of shit for it.</v>

4116
01:51:50.891 --> 01:51:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Whoever the fuck let that slip through.</v>

4117
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Like what are,</v>

4118
01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:54.970
<v Speaker 1>what message are you trying to send?</v>

4119
01:51:54.971 --> 01:51:58.900
<v Speaker 1>You said you were saying is this an anti male message because user or you're a</v>

4120
01:51:58.901 --> 01:51:59.680
<v Speaker 1>bunch of white women,</v>

4121
01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:00.280
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

4122
01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:01.520
<v Speaker 1>now you're getting into this.</v>

4123
01:52:01.630 --> 01:52:05.410
<v Speaker 1>My favorite fucking favorite new discipline,</v>

4124
01:52:05.620 --> 01:52:07.300
<v Speaker 1>which is intersections.</v>

4125
01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Feminism don't know what it is.</v>

4126
01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:12.220
<v Speaker 1>It's the best.</v>

4127
01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:13.000
<v Speaker 1>It's the best.</v>

4128
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:13.833
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>

4129
01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:14.170
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

4130
01:52:14.170 --> 01:52:17.440
<v Speaker 1>when did with the feminist movement really began with white women and I think it</v>

4131
01:52:17.441 --> 01:52:17.861
<v Speaker 1>started in the,</v>

4132
01:52:17.861 --> 01:52:18.970
<v Speaker 1>in the women's studies department,</v>

4133
01:52:18.971 --> 01:52:20.050
<v Speaker 1>or at least the literature department,</v>

4134
01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Yale University.</v>

4135
01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:22.990
<v Speaker 1>And they had,</v>

4136
01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:23.981
<v Speaker 1>they did some work,</v>

4137
01:52:23.981 --> 01:52:24.281
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4138
01:52:24.281 --> 01:52:24.370
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

4139
01:52:24.370 --> 01:52:25.820
<v Speaker 1>those women were serious and,</v>

4140
01:52:25.821 --> 01:52:28.600
<v Speaker 1>and you can't say that the feminist movement didn't have something to say and,</v>

4141
01:52:28.601 --> 01:52:29.411
<v Speaker 1>and have some work to do.</v>

4142
01:52:29.411 --> 01:52:30.244
<v Speaker 1>Of course it did.</v>

4143
01:52:30.420 --> 01:52:31.630
<v Speaker 1>A smart women were like,</v>

4144
01:52:31.631 --> 01:52:32.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking want to be,</v>

4145
01:52:32.771 --> 01:52:33.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4146
01:52:33.130 --> 01:52:35.290
<v Speaker 1>there are some issues and disparity,</v>

4147
01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:39.640
<v Speaker 1>but what happens with any movement is that it's like,</v>

4148
01:52:39.641 --> 01:52:39.881
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4149
01:52:39.881 --> 01:52:40.870
<v Speaker 1>we're white women.</v>

4150
01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:43.000
<v Speaker 1>What about black women?</v>

4151
01:52:43.450 --> 01:52:44.080
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

4152
01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:45.740
<v Speaker 1>they have it way worse than we do.</v>

4153
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:47.303
<v Speaker 3>And what about,</v>

4154
01:52:47.370 --> 01:52:48.680
<v Speaker 3>and we can just keep extrapolating.</v>

4155
01:52:48.681 --> 01:52:50.690
<v Speaker 3>What about black women with allergies?</v>

4156
01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Black women with Lupus.</v>

4157
01:52:51.921 --> 01:52:52.640
<v Speaker 3>How about,</v>

4158
01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:56.690
<v Speaker 3>what about black women who come from really poor and violent areas versus black</v>

4159
01:52:56.691 --> 01:52:58.280
<v Speaker 3>women to come from a better area?</v>

4160
01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:00.950
<v Speaker 3>What about black women who are midgets?</v>

4161
01:53:01.070 --> 01:53:02.450
<v Speaker 3>They're d you can keep,</v>

4162
01:53:03.190 --> 01:53:04.510
<v Speaker 3>I know little purses,</v>

4163
01:53:04.511 --> 01:53:05.181
<v Speaker 3>small people.</v>

4164
01:53:05.181 --> 01:53:06.190
<v Speaker 3>You can just keep time.</v>

4165
01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:08.210
<v Speaker 3>So often top,</v>

4166
01:53:08.211 --> 01:53:08.781
<v Speaker 3>sorry buddy.</v>

4167
01:53:08.781 --> 01:53:09.290
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

4168
01:53:09.290 --> 01:53:13.700
<v Speaker 3>The top at the top of the sort of power structure.</v>

4169
01:53:13.701 --> 01:53:17.420
<v Speaker 3>Now the inverted power structure is people that are the most oppressed.</v>

4170
01:53:17.450 --> 01:53:19.160
<v Speaker 3>They're the voices that have to be heard the most.</v>

4171
01:53:19.340 --> 01:53:23.720
<v Speaker 3>The problem with breaking this down into all these sections is you get</v>

4172
01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:24.950
<v Speaker 3>ultimately to,</v>

4173
01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:26.600
<v Speaker 3>cause when they had this huge,</v>

4174
01:53:26.601 --> 01:53:27.620
<v Speaker 3>Christine Summers talks about this,</v>

4175
01:53:27.621 --> 01:53:30.110
<v Speaker 3>they had this huge intersection hist,</v>

4176
01:53:30.290 --> 01:53:33.980
<v Speaker 3>feminist sort of congregation where all these women got together,</v>

4177
01:53:34.190 --> 01:53:36.500
<v Speaker 3>but in the group when they were meeting in the convention center,</v>

4178
01:53:36.501 --> 01:53:37.580
<v Speaker 3>they started breaking up.</v>

4179
01:53:37.820 --> 01:53:38.660
<v Speaker 3>They started breaking up,</v>

4180
01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:39.020
<v Speaker 3>oops.</v>

4181
01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:39.201
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4182
01:53:39.201 --> 01:53:39.771
<v Speaker 3>they were breaking up.</v>

4183
01:53:39.771 --> 01:53:40.220
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

4184
01:53:40.220 --> 01:53:40.401
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4185
01:53:40.401 --> 01:53:41.450
<v Speaker 3>we have allergies,</v>

4186
01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:43.100
<v Speaker 3>so we're not over there,</v>

4187
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.581
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>

4188
01:53:43.581 --> 01:53:43.911
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

4189
01:53:43.911 --> 01:53:44.670
<v Speaker 3>you're black,</v>

4190
01:53:44.670 --> 01:53:45.470
<v Speaker 3>you're white,</v>

4191
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:46.071
<v Speaker 3>you're a feminist,</v>

4192
01:53:46.071 --> 01:53:47.080
<v Speaker 3>but you date you're white,</v>

4193
01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:47.901
<v Speaker 3>black feminists,</v>

4194
01:53:47.901 --> 01:53:48.440
<v Speaker 3>but you also,</v>

4195
01:53:48.440 --> 01:53:49.340
<v Speaker 3>you date a white woman.</v>

4196
01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:50.120
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

4197
01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:50.870
<v Speaker 3>you're a little more privileged.</v>

4198
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:52.170
<v Speaker 3>You got to go over there in the midgets rovers,</v>

4199
01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:53.510
<v Speaker 3>so it became this.</v>

4200
01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:55.460
<v Speaker 3>If you get one click after another,</v>

4201
01:53:55.461 --> 01:53:57.070
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy that women become cliquey.</v>

4202
01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:58.070
<v Speaker 3>That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.</v>

4203
01:53:58.130 --> 01:54:00.020
<v Speaker 3>You want to know my favorite stories in regards to those.</v>

4204
01:54:00.021 --> 01:54:01.120
<v Speaker 3>Let me just finish this one story.</v>

4205
01:54:01.690 --> 01:54:05.480
<v Speaker 3>The problem with that movement is as you keep extrapolating,</v>

4206
01:54:05.481 --> 01:54:08.210
<v Speaker 3>you get to what's called the individual.</v>

4207
01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:11.750
<v Speaker 3>The founding fathers figured that out a long time ago.</v>

4208
01:54:12.050 --> 01:54:15.350
<v Speaker 3>Ultimately you're going to get down to the fact that you should treat everybody</v>

4209
01:54:15.351 --> 01:54:16.460
<v Speaker 3>as the thing,</v>

4210
01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:17.660
<v Speaker 3>as an individual.</v>

4211
01:54:18.770 --> 01:54:20.750
<v Speaker 3>I like it as an individual.</v>

4212
01:54:21.110 --> 01:54:22.310
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole point.</v>

4213
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:23.181
<v Speaker 3>That's that.</v>

4214
01:54:23.181 --> 01:54:23.960
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

4215
01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:25.130
<v Speaker 3>you can keep going,</v>

4216
01:54:25.131 --> 01:54:26.360
<v Speaker 3>but if you keep playing that game,</v>

4217
01:54:26.361 --> 01:54:28.370
<v Speaker 3>you're just going to get down to everybody's different.</v>

4218
01:54:28.371 --> 01:54:29.720
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has something.</v>

4219
01:54:29.721 --> 01:54:31.400
<v Speaker 3>Everybody is a white dude.</v>

4220
01:54:31.401 --> 01:54:34.970
<v Speaker 3>My buddy Dave Holly has a spine like this and he's,</v>

4221
01:54:34.971 --> 01:54:37.130
<v Speaker 3>he's going to die unless he gets an operation.</v>

4222
01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:38.090
<v Speaker 3>His life sucks.</v>

4223
01:54:38.091 --> 01:54:38.881
<v Speaker 3>He's about that big.</v>

4224
01:54:38.881 --> 01:54:40.620
<v Speaker 3>His email is no neck day.</v>

4225
01:54:40.621 --> 01:54:41.331
<v Speaker 3>If I say I love him,</v>

4226
01:54:41.331 --> 01:54:42.290
<v Speaker 3>he's fucking hilarious.</v>

4227
01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:43.153
<v Speaker 3>Dave Ali,</v>

4228
01:54:43.190 --> 01:54:44.540
<v Speaker 3>but Dave is white.</v>

4229
01:54:44.541 --> 01:54:45.530
<v Speaker 3>He ate privileged.</v>

4230
01:54:45.650 --> 01:54:46.291
<v Speaker 3>He came from home.</v>

4231
01:54:46.291 --> 01:54:47.031
<v Speaker 3>Mormon family,</v>

4232
01:54:47.031 --> 01:54:47.811
<v Speaker 3>a large family.</v>

4233
01:54:47.811 --> 01:54:48.430
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't.</v>

4234
01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:48.691
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4235
01:54:48.691 --> 01:54:50.630
<v Speaker 3>his life has not been fucking easy.</v>

4236
01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:53.720
<v Speaker 3>He can't breathe so you can keep extrapolating.</v>

4237
01:54:54.050 --> 01:54:56.630
<v Speaker 3>That's why you treat people as individuals because you don't know anything about</v>

4238
01:54:56.631 --> 01:54:56.751
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

4239
01:54:56.751 --> 01:54:58.790
<v Speaker 3>You actually don't know anything about what they've come through.</v>

4240
01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.350
<v Speaker 3>It could be a great looking guy,</v>

4241
01:55:00.410 --> 01:55:01.243
<v Speaker 3>sleeve tattoo,</v>

4242
01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:05.480
<v Speaker 3>nonsense conversation because what they're really trying to do is establish</v>

4243
01:55:05.481 --> 01:55:08.480
<v Speaker 3>power structures and they want to have power over the rest of the people.</v>

4244
01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:11.960
<v Speaker 3>In the group because they apparently have more things that are going against</v>

4245
01:55:11.961 --> 01:55:12.320
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

4246
01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:17.320
<v Speaker 3>as you were going to say that my favorite story is there was a an all girls</v>

4247
01:55:17.991 --> 01:55:22.130
<v Speaker 3>college and this woman is running for president of Student Council and she</v>

4248
01:55:22.131 --> 01:55:24.260
<v Speaker 3>decides that she's a male.</v>

4249
01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:27.480
<v Speaker 3>She decides to change her gender and uh,</v>

4250
01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:28.790
<v Speaker 3>then the fucking kiss,</v>

4251
01:55:28.791 --> 01:55:29.820
<v Speaker 3>she didn't get an operation though.</v>

4252
01:55:29.910 --> 01:55:30.071
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4253
01:55:30.071 --> 01:55:30.170
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

4254
01:55:30.170 --> 01:55:30.381
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

4255
01:55:30.381 --> 01:55:35.381
<v Speaker 3>She just decided she was a masculine of center of centered gender queer was how</v>

4256
01:55:36.021 --> 01:55:39.860
<v Speaker 3>she described herself card by decided to change her name to a male's name.</v>

4257
01:55:40.190 --> 01:55:42.710
<v Speaker 3>Then the women in the school,</v>

4258
01:55:42.770 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 3>we're against</v>

4259
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:48.870
<v Speaker 2>her because she is now a white man and the white man is the patriarchy and she,</v>

4260
01:55:48.871 --> 01:55:52.620
<v Speaker 2>it was the president of diversity or something like that.</v>

4261
01:55:52.621 --> 01:55:55.640
<v Speaker 2>Like some student council becomes of class madness,</v>

4262
01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:56.710
<v Speaker 2>diversity.</v>

4263
01:55:56.710 --> 01:55:57.600
<v Speaker 2>She'd go back.</v>

4264
01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:58.673
<v Speaker 2>I do not know.</v>

4265
01:55:59.310 --> 01:56:00.060
<v Speaker 2>I do not know.</v>

4266
01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:01.200
<v Speaker 2>Somebody sent me something about that.</v>

4267
01:56:01.201 --> 01:56:05.390
<v Speaker 2>How somebody said something about colleges had become these specialized,</v>

4268
01:56:05.391 --> 01:56:09.600
<v Speaker 2>they're specialized in subjects that have increasing irrelevance.</v>

4269
01:56:11.370 --> 01:56:11.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4270
01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:11.981
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4271
01:56:11.981 --> 01:56:13.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing man.</v>

4272
01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:18.380
<v Speaker 2>I think people automatically have this desire to stand out and be more</v>

4273
01:56:18.571 --> 01:56:19.080
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

4274
01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:20.070
<v Speaker 2>They automatically too.</v>

4275
01:56:20.130 --> 01:56:23.250
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a common thing and they can do it through merit but merit.</v>

4276
01:56:23.251 --> 01:56:23.941
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult.</v>

4277
01:56:23.941 --> 01:56:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Meritocracies are hard.</v>

4278
01:56:25.111 --> 01:56:30.111
<v Speaker 2>You might fall short and sometimes you in along the way you see your meritocracy</v>

4279
01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:32.010
<v Speaker 2>like not working out for you.</v>

4280
01:56:32.011 --> 01:56:32.240
<v Speaker 2>You'll,</v>

4281
01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:35.850
<v Speaker 2>you'll claim there's some sort of a conspiracy against you and there might be</v>

4282
01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:36.871
<v Speaker 2>cute claims,</v>

4283
01:56:36.871 --> 01:56:38.800
<v Speaker 2>other people of privilege and they might eat.</v>

4284
01:56:38.810 --> 01:56:42.300
<v Speaker 2>You'll claim all of these reasons why you're not getting ahead and you might be</v>

4285
01:56:42.301 --> 01:56:42.660
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4286
01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:45.710
<v Speaker 2>You might be right in some ways because colleges are like the thorn.</v>

4287
01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:49.520
<v Speaker 2>A lot of comics not doing the tours anymore or when they call just</v>

4288
01:56:51.030 --> 01:56:55.020
<v Speaker 2>before a lot of comics were doing cause stopped way before this,</v>

4289
01:56:55.021 --> 01:56:58.190
<v Speaker 2>I stopped the colleges and the early two thousands for that very reason.</v>

4290
01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:02.520
<v Speaker 2>For that reason there were just way too sensitive and they didn't have life</v>

4291
01:57:02.521 --> 01:57:03.354
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

4292
01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:07.560
<v Speaker 2>The problem is I like talking to people that have bills and jobs and people that</v>

4293
01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:10.590
<v Speaker 2>have relationships that didn't work out so good and now they have a fucking kid,</v>

4294
01:57:10.591 --> 01:57:11.640
<v Speaker 2>but some lady who hates him.</v>

4295
01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:12.720
<v Speaker 2>That's my crowd.</v>

4296
01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:15.410
<v Speaker 2>I know John People,</v>

4297
01:57:16.290 --> 01:57:18.060
<v Speaker 2>I like talking to people that owe taxes,</v>

4298
01:57:19.170 --> 01:57:20.700
<v Speaker 2>spending their fucking money,</v>

4299
01:57:20.701 --> 01:57:22.230
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out what they're doing in their life.</v>

4300
01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:25.630
<v Speaker 2>They want to talk about meritocracy is my favorite meritocracies there.</v>

4301
01:57:25.650 --> 01:57:27.540
<v Speaker 2>How you you find out who is real,</v>

4302
01:57:27.780 --> 01:57:29.130
<v Speaker 2>who really deserves it.</v>

4303
01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:30.690
<v Speaker 2>You don't do colleges anymore either.</v>

4304
01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Deep down I don't,</v>

4305
01:57:32.220 --> 01:57:36.000
<v Speaker 2>it's just not a smart thing to do because those people in those colleges are,</v>

4306
01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:36.991
<v Speaker 2>they're very,</v>

4307
01:57:36.991 --> 01:57:37.800
<v Speaker 2>very young.</v>

4308
01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:39.060
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with 19 year olds,</v>

4309
01:57:39.061 --> 01:57:39.661
<v Speaker 2>20 year olds,</v>

4310
01:57:39.661 --> 01:57:41.700
<v Speaker 2>and they're in this weird ideological bubble.</v>

4311
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:42.181
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4312
01:57:42.181 --> 01:57:45.300
<v Speaker 2>there's all these fucking peel that are just jammed in together in this group</v>

4313
01:57:45.301 --> 01:57:48.390
<v Speaker 2>and everybody's trying to stand out and weird and unique ways and there's people</v>

4314
01:57:48.391 --> 01:57:52.320
<v Speaker 2>that are doing it by claiming their masculine of center gender queer and</v>

4315
01:57:52.321 --> 01:57:53.880
<v Speaker 2>changing their name and wow,</v>

4316
01:57:53.881 --> 01:57:54.631
<v Speaker 2>you're so unique.</v>

4317
01:57:54.631 --> 01:57:55.464
<v Speaker 2>You're so amazing.</v>

4318
01:57:55.590 --> 01:57:58.350
<v Speaker 2>And there's also people that are doing it because they're trying to buck that</v>

4319
01:57:58.351 --> 01:57:58.800
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

4320
01:57:58.800 --> 01:57:59.500
<v Speaker 2>They're becoming the,</v>

4321
01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:02.310
<v Speaker 2>the Republicans on campus and people are calling them Nazis.</v>

4322
01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:02.761
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4323
01:58:02.761 --> 01:58:05.460
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of a fucking shoe palace should be talks about that.</v>

4324
01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:08.250
<v Speaker 2>And especially with someone rushed the stage.</v>

4325
01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:10.260
<v Speaker 2>We've suffered as much as you and he's like,</v>

4326
01:58:10.261 --> 01:58:11.094
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>

4327
01:58:11.150 --> 01:58:12.780
<v Speaker 2>you're a white woman to take it easy.</v>

4328
01:58:12.890 --> 01:58:17.720
<v Speaker 2>Now you've suffered thought like we've suffered as much as you to.</v>

4329
01:58:17.730 --> 01:58:19.470
<v Speaker 2>How does that invalidate this person's suffering?</v>

4330
01:58:19.471 --> 01:58:21.510
<v Speaker 2>If someone's on stage talking about their suffering,</v>

4331
01:58:21.511 --> 01:58:22.191
<v Speaker 2>yours did the,</v>

4332
01:58:22.191 --> 01:58:22.401
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4333
01:58:22.401 --> 01:58:25.380
<v Speaker 2>the nature of your suffering is invalid.</v>

4334
01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:27.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not relevant.</v>

4335
01:58:27.550 --> 01:58:27.800
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

4336
01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:28.120
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4337
01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:29.700
<v Speaker 2>you can relate to that person.</v>

4338
01:58:29.701 --> 01:58:30.271
<v Speaker 2>Not Relate,</v>

4339
01:58:30.271 --> 01:58:33.780
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that you can stop them from talking or that you think you can stop</v>

4340
01:58:33.781 --> 01:58:36.270
<v Speaker 2>them from talking just cause you've suffered yourself as well.</v>

4341
01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:37.260
<v Speaker 2>Like what did that mean?</v>

4342
01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:37.470
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4343
01:58:37.470 --> 01:58:39.690
<v Speaker 2>you're there for fucking audience.</v>

4344
01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:40.890
<v Speaker 2>You're an audience member.</v>

4345
01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:41.230
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

4346
01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:42.820
<v Speaker 2>your job is to sit down and listen.</v>

4347
01:58:43.110 --> 01:58:44.590
<v Speaker 2>If you want to be a performer,</v>

4348
01:58:44.650 --> 01:58:46.150
<v Speaker 2>well you need to fucking get an act.</v>

4349
01:58:46.151 --> 01:58:47.200
<v Speaker 2>You need to get booked at the club.</v>

4350
01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:48.340
<v Speaker 2>You need to become professional.</v>

4351
01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Have people come and pay to see you,</v>

4352
01:58:49.751 --> 01:58:51.040
<v Speaker 2>and then you can express yourself.</v>

4353
01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:55.450
<v Speaker 2>You're violating the audience versus performer rules.</v>

4354
01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:57.190
<v Speaker 2>I also think that people who are that sensitive,</v>

4355
01:58:57.191 --> 01:58:57.881
<v Speaker 2>they don't really,</v>

4356
01:58:57.881 --> 01:58:58.360
<v Speaker 2>they haven't,</v>

4357
01:58:58.360 --> 01:58:59.020
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>

4358
01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:02.650
<v Speaker 2>They haven't really figured out what they believe and they don't really believe</v>

4359
01:59:02.651 --> 01:59:03.251
<v Speaker 2>in what they're saying.</v>

4360
01:59:03.251 --> 01:59:06.640
<v Speaker 2>They just belong to a group and they like being a good foot soldier.</v>

4361
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:10.810
<v Speaker 2>They haven't really thought out why they haven't been challenged.</v>

4362
01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:12.070
<v Speaker 2>They might've thought it out,</v>

4363
01:59:12.071 --> 01:59:14.440
<v Speaker 2>but they've been thought about with a bunch of other people that are thinking</v>

4364
01:59:14.441 --> 01:59:16.630
<v Speaker 2>the same things that they think they felt it out.</v>

4365
01:59:16.631 --> 01:59:17.710
<v Speaker 2>It feels right.</v>

4366
01:59:17.711 --> 01:59:18.131
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>

4367
01:59:18.131 --> 01:59:21.160
<v Speaker 2>it's not thought well she's getting data on the live comedy show.</v>

4368
01:59:21.161 --> 01:59:23.120
<v Speaker 2>She has some serious issues going on.</v>

4369
01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:24.430
<v Speaker 2>She rushed the stage.</v>

4370
01:59:24.570 --> 01:59:25.091
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

4371
01:59:25.091 --> 01:59:25.630
<v Speaker 2>Like fat,</v>

4372
01:59:25.630 --> 01:59:26.830
<v Speaker 2>like fat shaming.</v>

4373
01:59:27.390 --> 01:59:27.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4374
01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:28.510
<v Speaker 2>There's another thing.</v>

4375
01:59:28.570 --> 01:59:29.403
<v Speaker 2>Fat Shaming.</v>

4376
01:59:29.540 --> 01:59:29.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4377
01:59:29.770 --> 01:59:31.060
<v Speaker 2>a very similar thing.</v>

4378
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not supposed to talk about people being overweight and I was talking</v>

4379
01:59:33.731 --> 01:59:34.750
<v Speaker 2>about people being fat.</v>

4380
01:59:34.751 --> 01:59:37.540
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to discuss it as being a real health issue,</v>

4381
01:59:37.740 --> 01:59:38.573
<v Speaker 2>that you're fat.</v>

4382
01:59:38.620 --> 01:59:39.790
<v Speaker 2>You're fat shaming them.</v>

4383
01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:41.260
<v Speaker 2>You talk about reality.</v>

4384
01:59:41.290 --> 01:59:44.590
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about your friend with his bad back and is fucked up spine and</v>

4385
01:59:44.830 --> 01:59:47.260
<v Speaker 2>has a hard time breathing and like seriously,</v>

4386
01:59:47.261 --> 01:59:48.910
<v Speaker 2>like from the jump,</v>

4387
01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:49.793
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4388
01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:50.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4389
01:59:51.010 --> 01:59:51.490
<v Speaker 2>you can.</v>

4390
01:59:51.490 --> 01:59:52.630
<v Speaker 2>That's just a reality.</v>

4391
01:59:53.200 --> 01:59:54.430
<v Speaker 2>But there'll be more weight.</v>

4392
01:59:54.431 --> 01:59:55.264
<v Speaker 2>Same thing,</v>

4393
01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:55.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

4394
01:59:55.810 --> 01:59:59.820
<v Speaker 2>it's worse because it's by decisions that they've made.</v>

4395
01:59:59.821 --> 02:00:01.360
<v Speaker 2>It's allowed them to get that big.</v>

4396
02:00:01.630 --> 02:00:03.310
<v Speaker 2>If you just decided to not eat,</v>

4397
02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:03.910
<v Speaker 2>that is a,</v>

4398
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:05.560
<v Speaker 2>that is a possible answer.</v>

4399
02:00:05.770 --> 02:00:07.110
<v Speaker 2>Now we go back to determinism.</v>

4400
02:00:07.111 --> 02:00:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4401
02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:08.650
<v Speaker 2>Then how much of your life is,</v>

4402
02:00:08.651 --> 02:00:09.484
<v Speaker 2>you're a beautiful man.</v>

4403
02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:11.170
<v Speaker 2>You're fine.</v>

4404
02:00:11.170 --> 02:00:12.520
<v Speaker 2>We have suffered more than you,</v>

4405
02:00:12.521 --> 02:00:13.354
<v Speaker 2>Brandon,</v>

4406
02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:14.680
<v Speaker 2>but if you go back to,</v>

4407
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:19.030
<v Speaker 2>you know what we're talking about about determinism mean is is your life,</v>

4408
02:00:19.450 --> 02:00:23.560
<v Speaker 2>are you right now in the middle of conscious decision making is shaping your</v>

4409
02:00:23.561 --> 02:00:26.500
<v Speaker 2>destiny or are you a product of all your life experiences?</v>

4410
02:00:26.770 --> 02:00:28.780
<v Speaker 2>All of the input that you've received,</v>

4411
02:00:28.781 --> 02:00:31.270
<v Speaker 2>your genetics and some days it's a very dangerous,</v>

4412
02:00:31.271 --> 02:00:35.980
<v Speaker 2>scary area because I don't like taking personal responsibility away from people.</v>

4413
02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:36.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it either,</v>

4414
02:00:36.971 --> 02:00:38.860
<v Speaker 2>but the reality about human bodies,</v>

4415
02:00:38.861 --> 02:00:40.750
<v Speaker 2>and Rhonda Patrick was talking about this the other day,</v>

4416
02:00:41.050 --> 02:00:45.970
<v Speaker 2>morbidly obese people have differences in their sperm that is transferred onto</v>

4417
02:00:46.450 --> 02:00:47.290
<v Speaker 2>onto their children.</v>

4418
02:00:47.590 --> 02:00:48.130
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>

4419
02:00:48.130 --> 02:00:49.240
<v Speaker 2>that does not exist.</v>

4420
02:00:49.241 --> 02:00:50.650
<v Speaker 2>When that person loses the weight speak.</v>

4421
02:00:50.651 --> 02:00:52.420
<v Speaker 2>It would be when a person loses the weight.</v>

4422
02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:52.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4423
02:00:52.890 --> 02:00:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Though that all those genetic problems go away.</v>

4424
02:00:56.770 --> 02:00:58.510
<v Speaker 2>So that did reverse himself that.</v>

4425
02:00:58.540 --> 02:00:59.890
<v Speaker 2>Then that raises another question.</v>

4426
02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:05.110
<v Speaker 2>If you do have a genetic propensity for whatever it might be,</v>

4427
02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:06.273
<v Speaker 2>gambling,</v>

4428
02:01:06.850 --> 02:01:07.683
<v Speaker 2>alcoholism.</v>

4429
02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:08.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4430
02:01:08.201 --> 02:01:09.020
<v Speaker 2>obesity.</v>

4431
02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:09.490
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

4432
02:01:09.490 --> 02:01:11.470
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't mean as a human being,</v>

4433
02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:14.860
<v Speaker 2>you can't figure out a way to</v>

4434
02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:21.190
<v Speaker 2>game the system so that you don't fall victim to it,</v>

4435
02:01:21.191 --> 02:01:21.850
<v Speaker 2>and we have to,</v>

4436
02:01:21.850 --> 02:01:26.500
<v Speaker 2>we have to keep that open as a possibility so that my freewill counts for a lot.</v>

4437
02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:28.960
<v Speaker 2>It was Rhonda Patrick Send all the fatties in another place,</v>

4438
02:01:28.961 --> 02:01:32.530
<v Speaker 2>but it was run a peptic saying that obesity is a,</v>

4439
02:01:32.650 --> 02:01:33.970
<v Speaker 2>it's passed down.</v>

4440
02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4441
02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

4442
02:01:35.110 --> 02:01:40.110
<v Speaker 2>She was saying that the genes that are problematic amongst obese people,</v>

4443
02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:41.960
<v Speaker 2>those jeans,</v>

4444
02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:44.720
<v Speaker 2>they change when the person loses the weight.</v>

4445
02:01:44.930 --> 02:01:49.160
<v Speaker 2>So even if a person has gastric bypass surgery and they lose the way and they</v>

4446
02:01:49.161 --> 02:01:51.620
<v Speaker 2>get down to a normal way where they're not obese anymore,</v>

4447
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:55.760
<v Speaker 2>their genes that they express and the way they transfer them to their children,</v>

4448
02:01:55.761 --> 02:01:56.630
<v Speaker 2>they will be different.</v>

4449
02:01:57.740 --> 02:01:59.420
<v Speaker 2>Meaning the children whose kids have it.</v>

4450
02:01:59.450 --> 02:01:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4451
02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:00.150
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

4452
02:02:00.150 --> 02:02:00.820
<v Speaker 2>He's skinny.</v>

4453
02:02:00.820 --> 02:02:02.030
<v Speaker 2>I had Al Roker is fine.</v>

4454
02:02:02.090 --> 02:02:05.390
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who's overweight and he has a daughter that's overweight and</v>

4455
02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:05.900
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4456
02:02:05.900 --> 02:02:06.650
<v Speaker 2>and she's,</v>

4457
02:02:06.650 --> 02:02:07.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4458
02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:08.990
<v Speaker 2>like approaching teenage years.</v>

4459
02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:11.390
<v Speaker 2>She's thick and now she's overweight.</v>

4460
02:02:11.420 --> 02:02:16.190
<v Speaker 2>She and shuts off and she drinks tons of soda and she eats tons of candy and</v>

4461
02:02:16.191 --> 02:02:17.120
<v Speaker 2>he's not a good friend.</v>

4462
02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:18.140
<v Speaker 2>He's just a guy that I know.</v>

4463
02:02:18.410 --> 02:02:19.250
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

4464
02:02:20.150 --> 02:02:20.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

4465
02:02:20.690 --> 02:02:22.430
<v Speaker 2>it's weird to watch cause it's like,</v>

4466
02:02:22.431 --> 02:02:24.520
<v Speaker 2>well I see where this is going.</v>

4467
02:02:24.540 --> 02:02:26.210
<v Speaker 2>He's not educated on nutrition.</v>

4468
02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:26.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4469
02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:27.620
<v Speaker 2>no he's not.</v>

4470
02:02:28.950 --> 02:02:29.781
<v Speaker 2>He's not a thinker.</v>

4471
02:02:29.781 --> 02:02:30.111
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't,</v>

4472
02:02:30.111 --> 02:02:32.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the guy well enough to the comp.</v>

4473
02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Obviously I would never comment on,</v>

4474
02:02:34.131 --> 02:02:34.281
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4475
02:02:34.281 --> 02:02:36.080
<v Speaker 2>you got to treat your fucking kid better.</v>

4476
02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:39.140
<v Speaker 2>But I see the kid and I'd see the thing and I'd just like,</v>

4477
02:02:39.141 --> 02:02:39.951
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

4478
02:02:39.951 --> 02:02:40.760
<v Speaker 2>this kid's fucked.</v>

4479
02:02:40.760 --> 02:02:42.620
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes when they're happy and they're fat though,</v>

4480
02:02:42.621 --> 02:02:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I appreciate it.</v>

4481
02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:44.153
<v Speaker 2>Cause unhappy.</v>

4482
02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:45.260
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a good,</v>

4483
02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:46.393
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

4484
02:02:46.630 --> 02:02:47.080
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

4485
02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:48.320
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things where,</v>

4486
02:02:48.410 --> 02:02:49.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4487
02:02:49.071 --> 02:02:52.640
<v Speaker 2>if you make choices and then your children see those choices and make those same</v>

4488
02:02:52.641 --> 02:02:53.474
<v Speaker 2>choices,</v>

4489
02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:54.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4490
02:02:54.710 --> 02:02:59.030
<v Speaker 2>you're responsible for passing that pattern on and some sort of a way.</v>

4491
02:02:59.031 --> 02:03:02.000
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes people don't realize that until someone like Rhonda Patrick says</v>

4492
02:03:02.001 --> 02:03:02.570
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

4493
02:03:02.570 --> 02:03:06.140
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that Rhonda sent me was an email that she had gotten where</v>

4494
02:03:06.141 --> 02:03:07.220
<v Speaker 2>someone sent to her.</v>

4495
02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:07.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4496
02:03:07.610 --> 02:03:09.920
<v Speaker 2>this guy that was literally listening to that,</v>

4497
02:03:09.921 --> 02:03:13.670
<v Speaker 2>eating some shitty food and put it down and decided there and then to make a</v>

4498
02:03:13.671 --> 02:03:14.421
<v Speaker 2>change in his life.</v>

4499
02:03:14.421 --> 02:03:14.691
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

4500
02:03:14.691 --> 02:03:18.380
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even think that this was going to literally change my jeans that I pass</v>

4501
02:03:18.381 --> 02:03:19.091
<v Speaker 2>onto my children.</v>

4502
02:03:19.091 --> 02:03:19.910
<v Speaker 2>That's really cool.</v>

4503
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:20.161
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

4504
02:03:20.161 --> 02:03:20.790
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

4505
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:24.920
<v Speaker 2>The more you learn about stuff out of your destiny,</v>

4506
02:03:24.921 --> 02:03:26.240
<v Speaker 2>but maybe your children's destiny.</v>

4507
02:03:26.241 --> 02:03:26.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4508
02:03:26.600 --> 02:03:28.160
<v Speaker 2>Some people just don't know more.</v>

4509
02:03:28.161 --> 02:03:28.360
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

4510
02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:28.911
<v Speaker 2>you're not just,</v>

4511
02:03:28.911 --> 02:03:29.201
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

4512
02:03:29.201 --> 02:03:31.610
<v Speaker 2>you're literally hamstringing them from birth.</v>

4513
02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:32.570
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

4514
02:03:32.570 --> 02:03:35.600
<v Speaker 2>if you're a fat fuck and you have these kids are fat shaming,</v>

4515
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:37.580
<v Speaker 2>you let let it out of the gate,</v>

4516
02:03:37.790 --> 02:03:38.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4517
02:03:38.061 --> 02:03:39.210
<v Speaker 2>and your children from,</v>

4518
02:03:39.230 --> 02:03:42.950
<v Speaker 2>from the jump or dealing with all your poor choices and you have to see that</v>

4519
02:03:42.951 --> 02:03:43.910
<v Speaker 2>that's going to punish you.</v>

4520
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Ma'Am.</v>

4521
02:03:44.290 --> 02:03:45.111
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it's education.</v>

4522
02:03:45.111 --> 02:03:46.340
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people just didn't know that.</v>

4523
02:03:46.370 --> 02:03:46.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4524
02:03:46.970 --> 02:03:48.860
<v Speaker 2>we used to be like high fiber,</v>

4525
02:03:48.890 --> 02:03:49.850
<v Speaker 2>low fat diets.</v>

4526
02:03:49.851 --> 02:03:51.860
<v Speaker 2>How you lose weight and people couldn't lose weight.</v>

4527
02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:52.611
<v Speaker 2>Then they were like,</v>

4528
02:03:52.611 --> 02:03:55.790
<v Speaker 2>try not eating sugar and bread and things that spike your insulin.</v>

4529
02:03:55.820 --> 02:03:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Some people who are obese,</v>

4530
02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:01.850
<v Speaker 2>are they saying it's maybe a mental weakness or is it a mental illness?</v>

4531
02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:02.181
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4532
02:04:02.181 --> 02:04:03.014
<v Speaker 2>they're saying,</v>

4533
02:04:03.110 --> 02:04:08.110
<v Speaker 2>well it's certainly everyone has the ability to do things different.</v>

4534
02:04:08.241 --> 02:04:13.241
<v Speaker 2>Like nothing stopping you from just cutting all the bad carbs out,</v>

4535
02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:15.380
<v Speaker 2>cutting all the refined sugar,</v>

4536
02:04:15.381 --> 02:04:16.820
<v Speaker 2>cutting all the refined carbohydrates,</v>

4537
02:04:16.821 --> 02:04:21.650
<v Speaker 2>eating like a very healthy diet and then working out all the time and slowly but</v>

4538
02:04:21.651 --> 02:04:23.510
<v Speaker 2>surely losing the weight and becoming healthy.</v>

4539
02:04:23.630 --> 02:04:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Nothing is physically stopping you from doing that.</v>

4540
02:04:25.671 --> 02:04:26.210
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4541
02:04:26.210 --> 02:04:27.350
<v Speaker 2>So what is stopping and,</v>

4542
02:04:27.351 --> 02:04:27.441
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4543
02:04:27.441 --> 02:04:29.240
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of behavior patterns that people deal,</v>

4544
02:04:29.241 --> 02:04:30.470
<v Speaker 2>which is a lot of depression.</v>

4545
02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:31.431
<v Speaker 2>There's addiction.</v>

4546
02:04:31.431 --> 02:04:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Like what are those mechanisms?</v>

4547
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:34.970
<v Speaker 2>And these are all things that we need to address to,</v>

4548
02:04:34.971 --> 02:04:35.631
<v Speaker 2>you can't just say,</v>

4549
02:04:35.631 --> 02:04:36.081
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

4550
02:04:36.081 --> 02:04:37.710
<v Speaker 2>pull yourself up by your bootstraps.</v>

4551
02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:39.180
<v Speaker 2>Cause people don't know how to do it.</v>

4552
02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:40.073
<v Speaker 2>How do I get it?</v>

4553
02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:40.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4554
02:04:40.770 --> 02:04:41.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4555
02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:41.970
<v Speaker 2>How do they get out of their own way?</v>

4556
02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:42.691
<v Speaker 2>They get depressed.</v>

4557
02:04:42.691 --> 02:04:43.650
<v Speaker 2>They feel terrible.</v>

4558
02:04:43.651 --> 02:04:45.180
<v Speaker 2>They feel maligned by society.</v>

4559
02:04:45.460 --> 02:04:46.800
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think helping them.</v>

4560
02:04:46.801 --> 02:04:50.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can help them by saying you're fat shaming them by talking</v>

4561
02:04:50.071 --> 02:04:52.270
<v Speaker 2>about the fact that being fat is gross.</v>

4562
02:04:52.271 --> 02:04:53.104
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4563
02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:53.700
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

4564
02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:54.570
<v Speaker 2>It's just bad for you.</v>

4565
02:04:54.580 --> 02:04:55.580
<v Speaker 2>It's going to do it anyway.</v>

4566
02:04:55.650 --> 02:04:55.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4567
02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:56.813
<v Speaker 2>The world's going to do it.</v>

4568
02:04:56.900 --> 02:04:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Quiet this.</v>

4569
02:05:00.490 --> 02:05:01.500
<v Speaker 2>This is my problem with the,</v>

4570
02:05:01.501 --> 02:05:02.334
<v Speaker 2>the the,</v>

4571
02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:03.990
<v Speaker 2>the side.</v>

4572
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:07.140
<v Speaker 2>It's the right on the left actually on the fringes.</v>

4573
02:05:07.290 --> 02:05:10.500
<v Speaker 2>They're way more interested in punishment than they are persuasion.</v>

4574
02:05:10.890 --> 02:05:11.580
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

4575
02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:14.160
<v Speaker 2>I know that we can pass lots of laws.</v>

4576
02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:18.530
<v Speaker 2>I know we can have workplace stuff that kind of like makes everybody safer,</v>

4577
02:05:18.570 --> 02:05:19.403
<v Speaker 2>quote unquote.</v>

4578
02:05:19.530 --> 02:05:21.660
<v Speaker 2>It's just going to suppress behavior.</v>

4579
02:05:21.661 --> 02:05:23.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to change behavior.</v>

4580
02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:24.720
<v Speaker 2>You need to figure out a way,</v>

4581
02:05:24.721 --> 02:05:26.820
<v Speaker 2>if you really serious about changing behavior,</v>

4582
02:05:26.821 --> 02:05:30.150
<v Speaker 2>appeal to my heart and my mind and my and,</v>

4583
02:05:30.160 --> 02:05:30.451
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

4584
02:05:30.451 --> 02:05:31.500
<v Speaker 2>and make it logical.</v>

4585
02:05:32.010 --> 02:05:33.540
<v Speaker 2>When you teach me how to eat,</v>

4586
02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:38.370
<v Speaker 2>they're the biggest tissue I always find with keeping people motivated is number</v>

4587
02:05:38.371 --> 02:05:38.760
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

4588
02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:39.593
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

4589
02:05:39.840 --> 02:05:40.673
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

4590
02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:41.281
<v Speaker 2>they can get,</v>

4591
02:05:41.281 --> 02:05:42.540
<v Speaker 2>you can get pumped up,</v>

4592
02:05:42.541 --> 02:05:46.800
<v Speaker 2>you can go to a Tony Robbins seminar and get pumped up and really make a change.</v>

4593
02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:50.340
<v Speaker 2>The question is how do you keep inspired day to day?</v>

4594
02:05:50.430 --> 02:05:51.350
<v Speaker 2>How do you stay in,</v>

4595
02:05:51.360 --> 02:05:51.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4596
02:05:51.540 --> 02:05:53.220
<v Speaker 2>that comment about inspiration,</v>

4597
02:05:53.221 --> 02:05:53.761
<v Speaker 2>that inspiration.</v>

4598
02:05:53.761 --> 02:05:54.594
<v Speaker 2>It's like bathing.</v>

4599
02:05:54.810 --> 02:05:55.471
<v Speaker 2>It's effective,</v>

4600
02:05:55.471 --> 02:05:56.730
<v Speaker 2>but it has to be done regularly.</v>

4601
02:05:56.790 --> 02:05:57.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4602
02:05:57.250 --> 02:05:57.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4603
02:05:57.481 --> 02:05:57.840
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

4604
02:05:57.840 --> 02:05:58.560
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4605
02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:00.960
<v Speaker 2>I think community and information,</v>

4606
02:06:01.110 --> 02:06:04.470
<v Speaker 2>these two are huge and you have to be around like minded people that also want</v>

4607
02:06:04.471 --> 02:06:05.304
<v Speaker 2>to do the same thing.</v>

4608
02:06:05.370 --> 02:06:07.530
<v Speaker 2>That helps when you're around fucking lazy.</v>

4609
02:06:07.531 --> 02:06:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Cons,</v>

4610
02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:09.140
<v Speaker 2>who don't want to do shit,</v>

4611
02:06:09.160 --> 02:06:10.170
<v Speaker 2>they're always making excuses.</v>

4612
02:06:10.171 --> 02:06:11.250
<v Speaker 2>It fucking trips you up.</v>

4613
02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:12.113
<v Speaker 2>It's real sad.</v>

4614
02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:14.340
<v Speaker 2>So if you have friends that are always making excuses,</v>

4615
02:06:14.580 --> 02:06:15.030
<v Speaker 2>you got to,</v>

4616
02:06:15.030 --> 02:06:16.080
<v Speaker 2>you got to push them away.</v>

4617
02:06:16.110 --> 02:06:17.580
<v Speaker 2>You've got to separate and you just tell him,</v>

4618
02:06:17.581 --> 02:06:18.001
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

4619
02:06:18.001 --> 02:06:18.840
<v Speaker 2>this is how I feel.</v>

4620
02:06:18.990 --> 02:06:21.390
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you're always crying about stuff and you're always thinking,</v>

4621
02:06:21.391 --> 02:06:22.520
<v Speaker 2>woe is me and you,</v>

4622
02:06:22.521 --> 02:06:22.730
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4623
02:06:22.730 --> 02:06:25.890
<v Speaker 2>you trip us all up and if you don't get of clown,</v>

4624
02:06:26.010 --> 02:06:29.310
<v Speaker 2>he give him the opportunity to see how you see them and if not,</v>

4625
02:06:29.311 --> 02:06:32.850
<v Speaker 2>you've got to find other people that are more motivated to improve their life.</v>

4626
02:06:32.970 --> 02:06:36.990
<v Speaker 2>Then inflammation and in community and information.</v>

4627
02:06:36.991 --> 02:06:39.120
<v Speaker 2>I also include things like this podcast,</v>

4628
02:06:39.150 --> 02:06:39.780
<v Speaker 2>any con,</v>

4629
02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:42.150
<v Speaker 2>any time people are talking about these things,</v>

4630
02:06:42.420 --> 02:06:43.253
<v Speaker 2>uninhibited,</v>

4631
02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:44.220
<v Speaker 2>uninterrupted,</v>

4632
02:06:44.250 --> 02:06:45.510
<v Speaker 2>and uncensored.</v>

4633
02:06:45.630 --> 02:06:45.781
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4634
02:06:45.781 --> 02:06:49.710
<v Speaker 2>you get to see the real thoughts that they have and then backed up by</v>

4635
02:06:49.711 --> 02:06:52.500
<v Speaker 2>information from people like Rhonda Patrick from scientists,</v>

4636
02:06:52.501 --> 02:06:53.940
<v Speaker 2>from peer reviewed studies,</v>

4637
02:06:54.030 --> 02:06:54.870
<v Speaker 2>things that you read.</v>

4638
02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:56.790
<v Speaker 2>You get a sense of like,</v>

4639
02:06:56.820 --> 02:06:57.061
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4640
02:06:57.061 --> 02:06:58.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm not alone in this.</v>

4641
02:06:58.350 --> 02:06:58.651
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4642
02:06:58.651 --> 02:07:00.930
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of other people that are thinking about these issues as well,</v>

4643
02:07:01.110 --> 02:07:02.190
<v Speaker 2>like what can we do?</v>

4644
02:07:02.191 --> 02:07:06.780
<v Speaker 2>What can I do on a personal level to get past whatever weird shit I'm tripping</v>

4645
02:07:06.781 --> 02:07:07.620
<v Speaker 2>up on my life?</v>

4646
02:07:07.810 --> 02:07:08.120
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>

4647
02:07:08.120 --> 02:07:08.331
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>

4648
02:07:08.331 --> 02:07:09.630
<v Speaker 2>Why do I keep smoking cigarettes?</v>

4649
02:07:09.631 --> 02:07:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Why do I keep lighten these fucking things up?</v>

4650
02:07:11.370 --> 02:07:12.240
<v Speaker 2>How come after work?</v>

4651
02:07:12.270 --> 02:07:14.370
<v Speaker 2>I just go for the ice cubes and start pouring scotch.</v>

4652
02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:15.330
<v Speaker 2>Why do I do that?</v>

4653
02:07:15.330 --> 02:07:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Why do I do that?</v>

4654
02:07:16.110 --> 02:07:20.190
<v Speaker 2>And all these people have to come to grips with this and having a community of</v>

4655
02:07:20.191 --> 02:07:24.150
<v Speaker 2>people like I learned a shit load when we did that sober October thing,</v>

4656
02:07:24.151 --> 02:07:24.420
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4657
02:07:24.420 --> 02:07:26.820
<v Speaker 2>I learned a shit load because I don't,</v>

4658
02:07:27.150 --> 02:07:29.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a drinking problem,</v>

4659
02:07:29.161 --> 02:07:30.930
<v Speaker 2>but knowing that I can't drink,</v>

4660
02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:35.860
<v Speaker 2>it's like inhibiting myself from that no smoking and then also having these 15</v>

4661
02:07:35.861 --> 02:07:38.950
<v Speaker 2>fucking yoga classes that we had to do 90 minute yoga classes in a month.</v>

4662
02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:40.330
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of everything,</v>

4663
02:07:40.570 --> 02:07:42.520
<v Speaker 2>but it was also that we were doing it together,</v>

4664
02:07:42.700 --> 02:07:43.531
<v Speaker 2>that Burt was doing it.</v>

4665
02:07:43.531 --> 02:07:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Tom Is doing it,</v>

4666
02:07:44.230 --> 02:07:44.431
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>

4667
02:07:44.431 --> 02:07:44.950
<v Speaker 2>he was doing it.</v>

4668
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:45.491
<v Speaker 2>I was doing it.</v>

4669
02:07:45.491 --> 02:07:46.360
<v Speaker 2>We're all doing it together.</v>

4670
02:07:46.361 --> 02:07:50.110
<v Speaker 2>We fed off of each other and at the end of it when we were all celebrating and</v>

4671
02:07:50.111 --> 02:07:50.561
<v Speaker 2>got through it,</v>

4672
02:07:50.561 --> 02:07:51.030
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

4673
02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:52.300
<v Speaker 2>I learned a lot from this.</v>

4674
02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:56.020
<v Speaker 2>I learned a lot from this about the power of community will learn a lot from</v>

4675
02:07:56.021 --> 02:07:57.940
<v Speaker 2>this about having things that you have to do,</v>

4676
02:07:58.120 --> 02:07:58.541
<v Speaker 2>like there's,</v>

4677
02:07:58.541 --> 02:07:59.231
<v Speaker 2>you just have to do.</v>

4678
02:07:59.231 --> 02:08:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Those 15 guys are also accountable to the Chubb.</v>

4679
02:08:01.570 --> 02:08:03.490
<v Speaker 2>Exactly where if you just try it yourself,</v>

4680
02:08:03.491 --> 02:08:04.271
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be tough,</v>

4681
02:08:04.271 --> 02:08:04.511
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4682
02:08:04.511 --> 02:08:04.931
<v Speaker 2>It's tough,</v>

4683
02:08:04.931 --> 02:08:07.450
<v Speaker 2>but tough community and information,</v>

4684
02:08:07.600 --> 02:08:09.010
<v Speaker 2>those two things are gigantic.</v>

4685
02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:10.360
<v Speaker 2>Community is big.</v>

4686
02:08:10.590 --> 02:08:13.630
<v Speaker 2>It's the information and education.</v>

4687
02:08:13.631 --> 02:08:14.760
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference they'll have that.</v>

4688
02:08:14.770 --> 02:08:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Friends are telling me,</v>

4689
02:08:15.810 --> 02:08:18.790
<v Speaker 2>I have that friend pulled on and some of them are fucking awesome.</v>

4690
02:08:18.850 --> 02:08:19.750
<v Speaker 2>You know this.</v>

4691
02:08:21.040 --> 02:08:22.300
<v Speaker 2>If they didn't want,</v>

4692
02:08:22.301 --> 02:08:25.210
<v Speaker 2>if they wanted to change and they were bitching about it and they didn't do</v>

4693
02:08:25.211 --> 02:08:25.841
<v Speaker 2>anything about it,</v>

4694
02:08:25.841 --> 02:08:26.710
<v Speaker 2>then it'd be a problem.</v>

4695
02:08:26.740 --> 02:08:30.580
<v Speaker 2>But some people were functional as fat peep and also happy and I celebrate it.</v>

4696
02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:31.473
<v Speaker 2>I like that,</v>

4697
02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:32.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4698
02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:32.351
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4699
02:08:32.351 --> 02:08:32.561
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

4700
02:08:32.561 --> 02:08:34.360
<v Speaker 2>some people are fat and they don't drink,</v>

4701
02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:36.130
<v Speaker 2>they don't smoke and they don't eat bad food.</v>

4702
02:08:36.131 --> 02:08:38.740
<v Speaker 2>They just eat too much or they eat a lot of pizza or something like that.</v>

4703
02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:43.000
<v Speaker 2>And then there's some people that are fat and whine and complain and they're</v>

4704
02:08:43.001 --> 02:08:43.834
<v Speaker 2>always depressed.</v>

4705
02:08:45.130 --> 02:08:45.910
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem.</v>

4706
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:46.743
<v Speaker 2>And they're not happy,</v>

4707
02:08:46.750 --> 02:08:47.583
<v Speaker 2>good at anything.</v>

4708
02:08:47.740 --> 02:08:48.031
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4709
02:08:48.031 --> 02:08:48.680
<v Speaker 2>this is the other thing,</v>

4710
02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:50.500
<v Speaker 2>like got to be fucking good at something,</v>

4711
02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:50.951
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4712
02:08:50.951 --> 02:08:52.690
<v Speaker 2>have something that you have joy in.</v>

4713
02:08:52.690 --> 02:08:56.380
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's a game that you like to play or whether it's a hobby that you</v>

4714
02:08:56.381 --> 02:08:56.920
<v Speaker 2>pursue.</v>

4715
02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:59.740
<v Speaker 2>I would say a big country has the good kind of fat.</v>

4716
02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:02.440
<v Speaker 2>He could give a fuck and he'll knock you out.</v>

4717
02:09:02.530 --> 02:09:06.610
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing with big country have been a world class fighter at 185</v>

4718
02:09:06.611 --> 02:09:07.444
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>

4719
02:09:07.480 --> 02:09:08.260
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't,</v>

4720
02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:09.093
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't heavy way.</v>

4721
02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Weird example but,</v>

4722
02:09:10.311 --> 02:09:10.810
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

4723
02:09:10.810 --> 02:09:11.291
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

4724
02:09:11.291 --> 02:09:12.460
<v Speaker 2>but think about that thing.</v>

4725
02:09:12.470 --> 02:09:15.340
<v Speaker 2>A big country if you like went on a crazy good diet.</v>

4726
02:09:15.550 --> 02:09:18.280
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno because it goes back to fun animal.</v>

4727
02:09:18.310 --> 02:09:21.460
<v Speaker 2>It goes back to also the idea that button Matt harness,</v>

4728
02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:23.800
<v Speaker 2>part of like his ability to fight,</v>

4729
02:09:24.190 --> 02:09:25.060
<v Speaker 2>stay calm,</v>

4730
02:09:25.320 --> 02:09:25.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4731
02:09:25.630 --> 02:09:28.990
<v Speaker 2>perform under pressure might be the fact that he could give a fuck.</v>

4732
02:09:29.290 --> 02:09:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

4733
02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:32.560
<v Speaker 2>like if you get too controlling about your weight,</v>

4734
02:09:32.590 --> 02:09:36.970
<v Speaker 2>you might get too controlling and Matt might be a mindset that you can't divest</v>

4735
02:09:36.971 --> 02:09:38.470
<v Speaker 2>from in everything else.</v>

4736
02:09:38.620 --> 02:09:41.650
<v Speaker 2>If you get to calculated with everything you're doing and you step in that</v>

4737
02:09:41.651 --> 02:09:42.281
<v Speaker 2>octagon,</v>

4738
02:09:42.281 --> 02:09:43.330
<v Speaker 2>something goes wrong.</v>

4739
02:09:43.630 --> 02:09:48.630
<v Speaker 2>You're not as loose maybe or your mind or your professional or your profession</v>

4740
02:09:49.420 --> 02:09:51.190
<v Speaker 2>or your fucking George Saint.</v>

4741
02:09:51.191 --> 02:09:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Pierre,</v>

4742
02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:52.623
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

4743
02:09:52.630 --> 02:09:55.000
<v Speaker 2>It's who's a control that certain certain,</v>

4744
02:09:55.001 --> 02:09:58.570
<v Speaker 2>a lot of champions are control freaks to the nth degree.</v>

4745
02:09:58.630 --> 02:09:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Lance Armstrong.</v>

4746
02:09:59.501 --> 02:09:59.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4747
02:09:59.950 --> 02:10:02.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean he had that shit down to a science.</v>

4748
02:10:02.531 --> 02:10:04.990
<v Speaker 2>You read about it and greatest of all time.</v>

4749
02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:05.980
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

4750
02:10:05.981 --> 02:10:06.521
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

4751
02:10:06.521 --> 02:10:08.140
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird conversation,</v>

4752
02:10:08.141 --> 02:10:08.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4753
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:11.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like where do you draw the line?</v>

4754
02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Like and what is more important?</v>

4755
02:10:13.481 --> 02:10:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Performance or happiness.</v>

4756
02:10:15.550 --> 02:10:16.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4757
02:10:16.270 --> 02:10:16.661
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

4758
02:10:16.661 --> 02:10:20.770
<v Speaker 2>that's another thing because sometimes your performance in order to reach the</v>

4759
02:10:20.771 --> 02:10:22.480
<v Speaker 2>real peak levels of performance,</v>

4760
02:10:22.481 --> 02:10:24.670
<v Speaker 2>especially to maintain it like as a champion,</v>

4761
02:10:25.090 --> 02:10:26.980
<v Speaker 2>you're not necessarily going to be happy.</v>

4762
02:10:26.981 --> 02:10:27.340
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4763
02:10:27.340 --> 02:10:27.910
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

4764
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:29.860
<v Speaker 2>You might be happy and brief moments after you,</v>

4765
02:10:29.861 --> 02:10:31.300
<v Speaker 2>when would that be in everything though.</v>

4766
02:10:31.300 --> 02:10:31.990
<v Speaker 2>Not just,</v>

4767
02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:34.580
<v Speaker 2>just not with whether it all sports,</v>

4768
02:10:34.581 --> 02:10:35.540
<v Speaker 2>but even entertainment.</v>

4769
02:10:35.541 --> 02:10:36.800
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to be the top,</v>

4770
02:10:36.801 --> 02:10:37.910
<v Speaker 2>top comedian,</v>

4771
02:10:38.300 --> 02:10:39.710
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to suffer.</v>

4772
02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:40.250
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have,</v>

4773
02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:42.080
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to be selfish and you know,</v>

4774
02:10:42.081 --> 02:10:43.640
<v Speaker 2>we do not spend as much time with your family.</v>

4775
02:10:43.641 --> 02:10:44.540
<v Speaker 2>You're on the road,</v>

4776
02:10:44.690 --> 02:10:44.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4777
02:10:44.901 --> 02:10:45.051
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

4778
02:10:45.051 --> 02:10:45.920
<v Speaker 2>you're doing this,</v>

4779
02:10:45.921 --> 02:10:46.380
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

4780
02:10:46.380 --> 02:10:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4781
02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:50.090
<v Speaker 2>I think it's with anything there's going to come where if you want to be the tip</v>

4782
02:10:50.091 --> 02:10:51.360
<v Speaker 2>of the spear there,</v>

4783
02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:53.030
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be some selfishness there.</v>

4784
02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:57.800
<v Speaker 2>And here's the other ironic thing that if you do spend too much time away from</v>

4785
02:10:57.801 --> 02:10:58.251
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>

4786
02:10:58.251 --> 02:11:02.900
<v Speaker 2>away from family and you won't be as good because you won't be as compelling.</v>

4787
02:11:03.050 --> 02:11:05.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like you have to find the balancing act.</v>

4788
02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:09.080
<v Speaker 2>You have to find a balancing act where or you won't be like happy.</v>

4789
02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things that I,</v>

4790
02:11:10.191 --> 02:11:14.420
<v Speaker 2>the guy I always bring up is Richard Jenny who eventually committed suicide and</v>

4791
02:11:14.421 --> 02:11:17.150
<v Speaker 2>I think to this day he's one of the greatest comics of all time.</v>

4792
02:11:17.180 --> 02:11:20.900
<v Speaker 2>The guy was fucking completely miserable and he had mental issues,</v>

4793
02:11:20.901 --> 02:11:22.550
<v Speaker 2>obviously it mental health issues,</v>

4794
02:11:22.551 --> 02:11:23.990
<v Speaker 2>which led him to commit suicide.</v>

4795
02:11:24.260 --> 02:11:25.093
<v Speaker 2>How long ago?</v>

4796
02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:27.590
<v Speaker 2>2007 Tude if you never,</v>

4797
02:11:27.660 --> 02:11:28.461
<v Speaker 2>you're a comic.</v>

4798
02:11:28.461 --> 02:11:29.310
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to do stand up.</v>

4799
02:11:29.650 --> 02:11:30.950
<v Speaker 2>She got to watch Richard Jeni,</v>

4800
02:11:31.310 --> 02:11:31.820
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

4801
02:11:31.820 --> 02:11:33.980
<v Speaker 2>listen to a big steaming pile of me.</v>

4802
02:11:33.981 --> 02:11:34.910
<v Speaker 2>I tell everybody to get it.</v>

4803
02:11:34.911 --> 02:11:36.260
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking brilliant.</v>

4804
02:11:36.540 --> 02:11:40.220
<v Speaker 2>He is the most underrated of all time and he was miserable.</v>

4805
02:11:40.250 --> 02:11:40.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4806
02:11:40.371 --> 02:11:44.670
<v Speaker 2>he's my top 20 all time greatest and he's in there and most people don't know</v>

4807
02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:45.620
<v Speaker 2>who George Solar,</v>

4808
02:11:45.621 --> 02:11:46.220
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>

4809
02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:46.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4810
02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Tortured.</v>

4811
02:11:46.940 --> 02:11:47.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4812
02:11:47.121 --> 02:11:48.680
<v Speaker 2>He did a lot of plastic surgery.</v>

4813
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:52.340
<v Speaker 2>Allegedly had peck implants at a bunch of shit done to his face.</v>

4814
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4815
02:11:52.700 --> 02:11:53.533
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4816
02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:54.411
<v Speaker 2>A lot of shit done.</v>

4817
02:11:54.411 --> 02:11:57.230
<v Speaker 2>He'd want it to be Jim Carrey want to be some leading man.</v>

4818
02:11:57.470 --> 02:11:59.660
<v Speaker 2>But when a rough July's along the way was,</v>

4819
02:11:59.690 --> 02:12:03.500
<v Speaker 2>well this was the thing back in those days in the eighties and nineties</v>

4820
02:12:03.740 --> 02:12:05.540
<v Speaker 2>everybody wanted to be a TV star.</v>

4821
02:12:05.540 --> 02:12:07.250
<v Speaker 2>They all wanted to be on home improvement.</v>

4822
02:12:07.251 --> 02:12:08.920
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to have their own show like Roseanne.</v>

4823
02:12:09.580 --> 02:12:12.350
<v Speaker 2>It didn't work out for everybody and he was one of the guys that didn't work out</v>

4824
02:12:12.351 --> 02:12:12.571
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

4825
02:12:12.571 --> 02:12:16.220
<v Speaker 2>But what he did have that he wasn't getting recognition for what some of the</v>

4826
02:12:16.221 --> 02:12:19.340
<v Speaker 2>best fucking standup at his standup is so good.</v>

4827
02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:20.870
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't enough for him.</v>

4828
02:12:20.890 --> 02:12:21.740
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't enough for him.</v>

4829
02:12:21.890 --> 02:12:22.640
<v Speaker 2>And why?</v>

4830
02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:23.001
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4831
02:12:23.001 --> 02:12:23.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean dude,</v>

4832
02:12:23.870 --> 02:12:24.860
<v Speaker 2>a lot of comics,</v>

4833
02:12:24.890 --> 02:12:25.910
<v Speaker 2>especially back then,</v>

4834
02:12:25.911 --> 02:12:26.840
<v Speaker 2>it's different now.</v>

4835
02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:28.550
<v Speaker 2>It's different now than it was back then.</v>

4836
02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:31.760
<v Speaker 2>But the community of comics is so like,</v>

4837
02:12:31.761 --> 02:12:32.594
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4838
02:12:32.690 --> 02:12:35.960
<v Speaker 2>it's so tight and so welcoming now.</v>

4839
02:12:36.170 --> 02:12:38.210
<v Speaker 2>Like we're all used to be.</v>

4840
02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:39.200
<v Speaker 2>It used to be way different,</v>

4841
02:12:39.201 --> 02:12:39.641
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4842
02:12:39.641 --> 02:12:40.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4843
02:12:40.010 --> 02:12:41.090
<v Speaker 2>Something happened.</v>

4844
02:12:41.091 --> 02:12:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Not a warm,</v>

4845
02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:43.730
<v Speaker 2>not a warm group.</v>

4846
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:44.870
<v Speaker 2>Not just that.</v>

4847
02:12:44.871 --> 02:12:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Like everybody was like all for themselves.</v>

4848
02:12:48.080 --> 02:12:48.531
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4849
02:12:48.531 --> 02:12:51.050
<v Speaker 2>like if you went to see a guy on the road,</v>

4850
02:12:51.140 --> 02:12:55.250
<v Speaker 2>they usually took some guy with them that sucked and that guy would do like 1520</v>

4851
02:12:55.251 --> 02:12:57.830
<v Speaker 2>minutes of Shitty standup and then this person would go out there and look like</v>

4852
02:12:57.831 --> 02:12:58.580
<v Speaker 2>a God.</v>

4853
02:12:58.580 --> 02:13:01.040
<v Speaker 2>And that was the standard move that everybody did.</v>

4854
02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Like George Carlin for the longest time,</v>

4855
02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:05.660
<v Speaker 2>took this guy on the road with them that didn't work any other places.</v>

4856
02:13:05.810 --> 02:13:07.040
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of those guys,</v>

4857
02:13:07.041 --> 02:13:07.251
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>

4858
02:13:07.251 --> 02:13:10.130
<v Speaker 2>they'll take a guy that works on the road only with them.</v>

4859
02:13:10.340 --> 02:13:13.970
<v Speaker 2>They literally don't even work as a professional outside of opening it for that.</v>

4860
02:13:14.630 --> 02:13:17.110
<v Speaker 2>And they'll do this shitty act and then this guy comes on,</v>

4861
02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:18.460
<v Speaker 2>it looks like it's just to make him look good,</v>

4862
02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:19.340
<v Speaker 2>just to make them look good.</v>

4863
02:13:19.341 --> 02:13:22.040
<v Speaker 2>And that was what the standard move was.</v>

4864
02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:25.340
<v Speaker 2>And then something happened and I don't know what it is.</v>

4865
02:13:25.370 --> 02:13:26.870
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a bunch of factors,</v>

4866
02:13:27.170 --> 02:13:30.440
<v Speaker 2>but I think one of the factors that happened was that there was more opportunity</v>

4867
02:13:30.441 --> 02:13:30.861
<v Speaker 2>available,</v>

4868
02:13:30.861 --> 02:13:32.430
<v Speaker 2>so wasn't this feeling of scarcity</v>

4869
02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:35.310
<v Speaker 1>because before when it was just everybody trying to get a network show,</v>

4870
02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:36.273
<v Speaker 1>everybody was like,</v>

4871
02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:37.291
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

4872
02:13:37.291 --> 02:13:39.510
<v Speaker 1>you might be trying for the same part I'm trying for.</v>

4873
02:13:39.511 --> 02:13:39.711
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

4874
02:13:39.711 --> 02:13:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I want to be the host of the tonight show.</v>

4875
02:13:40.891 --> 02:13:42.010
<v Speaker 1>You want to be the host of night show,</v>

4876
02:13:42.150 --> 02:13:42.870
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

4877
02:13:42.870 --> 02:13:44.400
<v Speaker 1>It's all every man for himself.</v>

4878
02:13:44.990 --> 02:13:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Your slots are ways to make a living.</v>

4879
02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Then in the two thousands it opened up and the internet sort of opened up all</v>

4880
02:13:51.811 --> 02:13:54.590
<v Speaker 1>these different possibilities and then guys like us realized,</v>

4881
02:13:54.591 --> 02:13:55.424
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4882
02:13:55.680 --> 02:14:00.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't really get represented correctly in anything that I do that other people</v>

4883
02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:00.510
<v Speaker 1>write.</v>

4884
02:14:00.510 --> 02:14:04.300
<v Speaker 1>What I need to do is figure out how to just be myself like like people able to</v>

4885
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:07.950
<v Speaker 1>have this distorted idea of who you are because you hosted fear factor or you</v>

4886
02:14:08.190 --> 02:14:10.860
<v Speaker 1>were on mad TV is pool boy or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

4887
02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4888
02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:13.350
<v Speaker 1>this is how they view you and you hold on,</v>

4889
02:14:13.351 --> 02:14:14.460
<v Speaker 1>why did that?</v>

4890
02:14:14.461 --> 02:14:17.010
<v Speaker 1>But I also do this and I'm also this person.</v>

4891
02:14:17.011 --> 02:14:19.710
<v Speaker 1>And back then you couldn't do that.</v>

4892
02:14:19.950 --> 02:14:22.680
<v Speaker 1>It didn't exist before there was the internet.</v>

4893
02:14:22.681 --> 02:14:25.320
<v Speaker 1>And before you could actually express yourself completely uncensored.</v>

4894
02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:30.450
<v Speaker 1>So I think that that led people to be like much more scarcity minded,</v>

4895
02:14:30.451 --> 02:14:31.920
<v Speaker 1>much more famine thinking,</v>

4896
02:14:32.270 --> 02:14:32.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4897
02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:35.190
<v Speaker 1>and famine thinking is the fucking enemy of community.</v>

4898
02:14:35.470 --> 02:14:36.960
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you have famine thinking,</v>

4899
02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:38.280
<v Speaker 1>especially being created by you,</v>

4900
02:14:38.281 --> 02:14:39.990
<v Speaker 1>say that because that is his amazing book.</v>

4901
02:14:40.260 --> 02:14:40.801
<v Speaker 1>I just finished.</v>

4902
02:14:40.801 --> 02:14:42.090
<v Speaker 1>You should have this guy on your podcast,</v>

4903
02:14:42.091 --> 02:14:42.924
<v Speaker 1>Dan Coyle.</v>

4904
02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Did you send me that as a dam?</v>

4905
02:14:43.970 --> 02:14:44.370
<v Speaker 1>You sent me?</v>

4906
02:14:44.370 --> 02:14:45.380
<v Speaker 1>It's called the culture code.</v>

4907
02:14:45.381 --> 02:14:46.380
<v Speaker 1>He wrote the talent code too.</v>

4908
02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:48.270
<v Speaker 1>He's tended highly successful groups.</v>

4909
02:14:48.271 --> 02:14:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Seal team six of this,</v>

4910
02:14:49.580 --> 02:14:51.150
<v Speaker 1>the seal team,</v>

4911
02:14:51.151 --> 02:14:51.530
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

4912
02:14:51.530 --> 02:14:52.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4913
02:14:52.010 --> 02:14:52.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4914
02:14:52.590 --> 02:14:53.100
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

4915
02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:53.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4916
02:14:53.410 --> 02:14:54.720
<v Speaker 1>even jewelry thieves.</v>

4917
02:14:54.750 --> 02:14:57.030
<v Speaker 1>So they were like these amazing jewel thieves.</v>

4918
02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:00.300
<v Speaker 1>They studied them and they were these guys and they would come in,</v>

4919
02:15:00.330 --> 02:15:03.510
<v Speaker 1>they stole from a t in the middle of the day in Tokyo,</v>

4920
02:15:03.870 --> 02:15:06.720
<v Speaker 1>$105 million worth of diamonds.</v>

4921
02:15:07.260 --> 02:15:08.670
<v Speaker 1>I think they went to Monaco.</v>

4922
02:15:08.730 --> 02:15:09.421
<v Speaker 1>Same thing,</v>

4923
02:15:09.421 --> 02:15:14.170
<v Speaker 1>stole like $50 million worth of bedrooms and stuff and got away and speedboats</v>

4924
02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:14.700
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4925
02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:18.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean these guys would come in for 40 45 seconds,</v>

4926
02:15:18.421 --> 02:15:20.700
<v Speaker 1>come in the bash when and they were like,</v>

4927
02:15:20.701 --> 02:15:21.361
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck.</v>

4928
02:15:21.361 --> 02:15:22.260
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't figure it out.</v>

4929
02:15:22.261 --> 02:15:22.920
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

4930
02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:23.460
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

4931
02:15:23.460 --> 02:15:28.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean they were daring and they would treat the people in the stores roughly,</v>

4932
02:15:28.141 --> 02:15:28.891
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't kill anybody,</v>

4933
02:15:28.891 --> 02:15:29.550
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

4934
02:15:29.550 --> 02:15:30.990
<v Speaker 1>and they were strong.</v>

4935
02:15:30.991 --> 02:15:32.880
<v Speaker 1>They looked athletic and they were like,</v>

4936
02:15:32.881 --> 02:15:33.091
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

4937
02:15:33.091 --> 02:15:37.590
<v Speaker 1>this is obviously obviously probably our cons.</v>

4938
02:15:37.591 --> 02:15:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Tigers from the Serbian war.</v>

4939
02:15:39.301 --> 02:15:43.230
<v Speaker 1>They're clearly Serbian krauts special forces guys,</v>

4940
02:15:43.231 --> 02:15:43.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4941
02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:44.131
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

4942
02:15:44.131 --> 02:15:45.480
<v Speaker 1>they were just to organize.</v>

4943
02:15:45.481 --> 02:15:46.314
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

4944
02:15:46.710 --> 02:15:47.550
<v Speaker 1>like literally,</v>

4945
02:15:47.551 --> 02:15:48.990
<v Speaker 1>they wa they move like water.</v>

4946
02:15:49.110 --> 02:15:49.560
<v Speaker 1>They do.</v>

4947
02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:51.030
<v Speaker 1>They would dress up as women.</v>

4948
02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:53.060
<v Speaker 1>They'd say they come in like these beautiful women.</v>

4949
02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Turns out there are men,</v>

4950
02:15:54.121 --> 02:15:55.560
<v Speaker 1>but they look like women.</v>

4951
02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:56.060
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

4952
02:15:56.060 --> 02:15:57.580
<v Speaker 1>there's no biological difference.</v>

4953
02:15:58.750 --> 02:15:59.820
<v Speaker 1>And it come in and they just,</v>

4954
02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:01.050
<v Speaker 1>but they get away with,</v>

4955
02:16:01.110 --> 02:16:01.861
<v Speaker 1>let me say it again,</v>

4956
02:16:01.861 --> 02:16:05.100
<v Speaker 1>$105 million in diamonds at a time.</v>

4957
02:16:05.101 --> 02:16:05.934
<v Speaker 1>Crazy shit.</v>

4958
02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.380
<v Speaker 1>The most successful of all time.</v>

4959
02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:10.380
<v Speaker 1>So they're trying to think the,</v>

4960

<v Speaker 1>he studied to be a lawyer.</v>

4972
02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Another one said it'd</v>

02:16:31.570 --> 02:16:32.920
<v Speaker 3>These are men and women by the way.</v>

4976
02:16:33.250 --> 02:16:33.980
<v Speaker 3>Another one,</v>

4977
02:16:33.980 --> 02:16:34.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

02:16:34.210 --> 02:16:35.043
<v Speaker 3>studied,</v>

4979
02:16:35.050 --> 02:16:36.040
<v Speaker 3>played basketball,</v>

4980
02:16:36.041 --> 02:16:37.350
<v Speaker 3>kind of like first second.</v>

4981
02:16:37.390 --> 02:16:38.950
<v Speaker 3>I almost made it pro but didn't,</v>

4982
02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:40.480
<v Speaker 3>nothing that remarkable.</v>

4983
02:16:40.510 --> 02:16:41.440
<v Speaker 3>Middleclass kids,</v>

4984
02:16:42.310 --> 02:16:43.330
<v Speaker 3>they all,</v>

4985
02:16:43.510 --> 02:16:44.343
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>

4986
02:16:44.650 --> 02:16:44.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4987
02:16:44.810 --> 02:16:45.643
<v Speaker 3>and there was no leader,</v>

4988
02:16:45.670 --> 02:16:46.570
<v Speaker 3>there was no mastermind.</v>

4989
02:16:46.571 --> 02:16:47.660
<v Speaker 3>They thought there's gotta be a master.</v>

4990
02:16:47.661 --> 02:16:48.910
<v Speaker 3>And I got to find the mastermind.</v>

4991
02:16:48.911 --> 02:16:49.121
<v Speaker 3>Odd.</v>

4992
02:16:49.121 --> 02:16:51.490
<v Speaker 3>There's always a mastermind that they bring the Jews back to.</v>

4993
02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:52.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

4994
02:16:52.150 --> 02:16:52.983
<v Speaker 3>not that either.</v>

4995
02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:57.970
<v Speaker 3>They were just a loose confederation of friends from three different towns.</v>

4996
02:16:57.971 --> 02:16:59.860
<v Speaker 3>I think he would have known each other since childhood.</v>

4997
02:17:00.220 --> 02:17:00.911
<v Speaker 3>And they had,</v>

4998
02:17:00.911 --> 02:17:01.930
<v Speaker 3>they grown up in the war.</v>

4999
02:17:02.410 --> 02:17:03.050
<v Speaker 3>So they,</v>

5000
02:17:03.050 --> 02:17:08.050
<v Speaker 3>they had a taste for action and adventure and they,</v>

5001
02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:12.430
<v Speaker 3>but they were all close and they would get together and they would plan these,</v>

5002
02:17:12.490 --> 02:17:13.990
<v Speaker 3>they would plan out these whole,</v>

02:17:15.220 --> 02:17:17.410
<v Speaker 3>heists and the way they would do it,</v>

5006
02:17:17.890 --> 02:17:19.900
<v Speaker 3>the way they would do it would was,</v>

5007
02:17:19.901 --> 02:17:22.090
<v Speaker 3>it was fascinating because there was no boss.</v>

5008
02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:26.620
<v Speaker 3>They would just spitball ideas and everybody was safe,</v>

5009
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:28.360
<v Speaker 3>not only to come up with a good idea,</v>

5010
02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:30.400
<v Speaker 3>but everybody was also safe to sort of like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and how they work together and how how they communicate,</v>

5104
02:19:45.310 --> 02:19:46.800
<v Speaker 1>and that's really the question too.</v>

5105
02:19:46.801 --> 02:19:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Like what makes a great team?</v>

5106
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Is a great team just having killer individual players or is it having really</v>

5107
02:19:52.851 --> 02:19:56.060
<v Speaker 1>good individual players in a killer and environment and they all grow and get</v>

5108
02:19:56.061 --> 02:19:56.571
<v Speaker 1>better together?</v>

5109
02:19:56.571 --> 02:19:57.231
<v Speaker 1>They've done studies.</v>

5110
02:19:57.231 --> 02:19:57.441
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

5111
02:19:57.441 --> 02:20:01.190
<v Speaker 1>you've got to think that a guy who's in the NFL say for his first year,</v>

5112
02:20:01.191 --> 02:20:02.270
<v Speaker 1>as long as it doesn't get injured,</v>

5113
02:20:02.570 --> 02:20:05.150
<v Speaker 1>if he keeps playing and he keeps hustling and keeps learning,</v>

5114
02:20:05.151 --> 02:20:06.860
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be better in two years,</v>

5115
02:20:06.950 --> 02:20:07.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5116
02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:08.361
<v Speaker 1>If he doesn't get injured,</v>

5117
02:20:08.361 --> 02:20:10.400
<v Speaker 1>NBA is probably better because you don't get injured as much,</v>

5118
02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:13.700
<v Speaker 1>but you got to think that these players are going to get better at basketball,</v>

5119
02:20:13.701 --> 02:20:16.490
<v Speaker 1>better at competing under pressure and get better at playing together.</v>

5120
02:20:16.820 --> 02:20:17.631
<v Speaker 1>They're all going to get better.</v>

5121
02:20:17.631 --> 02:20:21.110
<v Speaker 1>These guys were talking about this before in the world.</v>

5122
02:20:21.140 --> 02:20:21.331
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

5123
02:20:21.331 --> 02:20:21.561
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

5124
02:20:21.561 --> 02:20:22.970
<v Speaker 1>the Golden State Warriors,</v>

5125
02:20:23.270 --> 02:20:23.751
<v Speaker 1>you know the,</v>

5126
02:20:23.751 --> 02:20:24.920
<v Speaker 1>they call him a super team,</v>

5127
02:20:24.921 --> 02:20:26.240
<v Speaker 1>but they were drafted.</v>

5128
02:20:26.940 --> 02:20:27.980
<v Speaker 1>They added Kevin Durant,</v>

5129
02:20:27.981 --> 02:20:29.030
<v Speaker 1>which makes them even better.</v>

5130
02:20:29.031 --> 02:20:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Who's one of the best players in the league?</v>

5131
02:20:30.140 --> 02:20:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Top three.</v>

5132
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:31.990
<v Speaker 1>But before that they had,</v>

5133
02:20:32.010 --> 02:20:32.930
<v Speaker 1>they were all drafted,</v>

5134
02:20:32.931 --> 02:20:33.800
<v Speaker 1>came up together.</v>

5135
02:20:33.801 --> 02:20:35.090
<v Speaker 1>So they play as a team.</v>

5136
02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Right now they're on unstoppable.</v>

5137
02:20:36.490 --> 02:20:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5138
02:20:36.820 --> 02:20:41.820
<v Speaker 1>so like a Cleveland or Miami put all these superstars together,</v>

5139
02:20:41.991 --> 02:20:43.940
<v Speaker 1>Houston or Okc,</v>

5140
02:20:44.180 --> 02:20:46.940
<v Speaker 1>the Golden State Warriors were draft and they came up as a team.</v>

5141
02:20:46.941 --> 02:20:47.780
<v Speaker 1>Now they're super cute.</v>

5142
02:20:47.781 --> 02:20:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Even like teams,</v>

5143
02:20:48.801 --> 02:20:50.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a whole lot about teams,</v>

5144
02:20:50.271 --> 02:20:53.480
<v Speaker 1>but teams that grow up to that get put together.</v>

5145
02:20:53.720 --> 02:20:55.910
<v Speaker 1>They depend upon some sense of community.</v>

5146
02:20:55.911 --> 02:20:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5147
02:20:56.390 --> 02:20:57.590
<v Speaker 1>When that community falls apart,</v>

5148
02:20:57.591 --> 02:21:01.000
<v Speaker 1>like remember when Shaq and Kobe beef and it was a real problem,</v>

5149
02:21:01.001 --> 02:21:04.790
<v Speaker 1>the real problem because they were playing on the same team and Shaq was doing</v>

5150
02:21:04.791 --> 02:21:06.080
<v Speaker 1>raps about Colby.</v>

5151
02:21:06.081 --> 02:21:09.250
<v Speaker 1>It was a fucking real problem that kills things because killed things mean it's</v>

5152
02:21:09.251 --> 02:21:13.220
<v Speaker 1>somebody has dominion just on who they are over the group.</v>

5153
02:21:13.460 --> 02:21:16.070
<v Speaker 1>That becomes a problem because everybody has to share ideas.</v>

5154
02:21:16.340 --> 02:21:16.701
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

5155
02:21:16.701 --> 02:21:17.790
<v Speaker 1>the structural engineer,</v>

5156
02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:18.770
<v Speaker 1>you heard me talking about this,</v>

5157
02:21:18.771 --> 02:21:20.750
<v Speaker 1>a structural engineer and this architect,</v>

5158
02:21:20.751 --> 02:21:23.600
<v Speaker 1>he did this amazing study where he took CEOs,</v>

5159
02:21:23.810 --> 02:21:24.643
<v Speaker 1>lawyers,</v>

5160
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5161
02:21:25.430 --> 02:21:28.070
<v Speaker 1>business students and kindergarteners,</v>

5162
02:21:28.430 --> 02:21:29.030
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

5163
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.510
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

5164
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:30.080
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>

5165
02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:30.681
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>

5166
02:21:30.681 --> 02:21:31.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5167
02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:31.910
<v Speaker 1>here's the task.</v>

5168
02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:34.820
<v Speaker 1>26 pieces of uncooked spaghetti,</v>

5169
02:21:35.420 --> 02:21:36.710
<v Speaker 1>a yard of tape,</v>

5170
02:21:37.220 --> 02:21:38.480
<v Speaker 1>a yard of string,</v>

5171
02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:40.940
<v Speaker 1>and a marshmallow might be one last thing.</v>

5172
02:21:40.941 --> 02:21:41.774
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

5173
02:21:42.380 --> 02:21:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Whoever makes the tallest structure is the one that wins.</v>

5174
02:21:46.550 --> 02:21:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Ceos,</v>

5175
02:21:47.810 --> 02:21:48.643
<v Speaker 1>lawyers.</v>

5176
02:21:50.450 --> 02:21:53.590
<v Speaker 1>The kindergarten kindergarteners figured it out because the way they approached</v>

5177
02:21:53.591 --> 02:21:54.410
<v Speaker 1>the problem,</v>

5178
02:21:54.410 --> 02:21:57.590
<v Speaker 1>nobody had invisible ideas of authority.</v>

5179
02:21:57.620 --> 02:21:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had sort of this kind of,</v>

5180
02:21:58.791 --> 02:21:59.421
<v Speaker 1>I know more than me.</v>

5181
02:21:59.421 --> 02:22:00.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say my thing.</v>

5182
02:22:00.590 --> 02:22:01.423
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>

5183
02:22:01.740 --> 02:22:02.061
<v Speaker 1>and now,</v>

5184
02:22:02.061 --> 02:22:02.790
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

5185
02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:03.180
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

5186
02:22:03.180 --> 02:22:03.800
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

5187
02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:05.500
<v Speaker 1>we're all fucking idea.</v>

5188
02:22:05.650 --> 02:22:06.081
<v Speaker 1>And there were no,</v>

5189
02:22:06.081 --> 02:22:06.621
<v Speaker 1>let me do this.</v>

5190
02:22:06.621 --> 02:22:08.030
<v Speaker 1>And they would just fight over the idea,</v>

5191
02:22:08.031 --> 02:22:09.070
<v Speaker 1>but it was the best guy.</v>

5192
02:22:09.080 --> 02:22:10.160
<v Speaker 1>He's listening to the kindergarten.</v>

5193
02:22:10.161 --> 02:22:11.210
<v Speaker 1>The best idea would win.</v>

5194
02:22:11.350 --> 02:22:11.631
<v Speaker 1>Be like,</v>

5195
02:22:11.631 --> 02:22:12.201
<v Speaker 1>shut up kid.</v>

5196
02:22:12.201 --> 02:22:13.034
<v Speaker 1>You're fine.</v>

5197
02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:13.460
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5198
02:22:13.460 --> 02:22:14.300
<v Speaker 1>they were all together.</v>

5199
02:22:14.330 --> 02:22:15.260
<v Speaker 1>It was groups of four.</v>

5200
02:22:15.290 --> 02:22:16.480
<v Speaker 1>So there are four kindergartners,</v>

5201
02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:17.220
<v Speaker 1>but the kindergartens,</v>

5202
02:22:17.220 --> 02:22:18.230
<v Speaker 1>the four of them figured it out.</v>

5203
02:22:18.260 --> 02:22:18.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5204
02:22:18.451 --> 02:22:22.310
<v Speaker 1>They built a 26 in structure and the second one was the CEO's.</v>

5205
02:22:22.311 --> 02:22:25.860
<v Speaker 1>They built a 22 inch ratios are thinking about cocaine and Pussy Bromley,</v>

5206
02:22:25.950 --> 02:22:27.090
<v Speaker 1>how their stocks are doing.</v>

5207
02:22:27.120 --> 02:22:29.700
<v Speaker 1>There's too distracted and give a fuck.</v>

5208
02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:32.430
<v Speaker 1>It's the question of like what makes children learn better?</v>

5209
02:22:32.610 --> 02:22:32.911
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5210
02:22:32.911 --> 02:22:33.744
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

5211
02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:36.000
<v Speaker 1>I watched kids,</v>

5212
02:22:36.001 --> 02:22:38.700
<v Speaker 1>obviously I have them and I watched them learn things.</v>

5213
02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:43.110
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting how some kids learn things really quickly and some things</v>

5214
02:22:43.111 --> 02:22:44.550
<v Speaker 1>don't or some kids don't.</v>

5215
02:22:44.700 --> 02:22:48.540
<v Speaker 1>And how parents just really don't have the ability to learn at the same level</v>

5216
02:22:48.541 --> 02:22:48.961
<v Speaker 1>the kids do.</v>

5217
02:22:48.961 --> 02:22:49.291
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm like,</v>

5218
02:22:49.291 --> 02:22:49.411
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5219
02:22:49.411 --> 02:22:50.220
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>

5220
02:22:50.220 --> 02:22:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Is it a physical limitation?</v>

5221
02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Is it a clarity thing?</v>

5222
02:22:54.061 --> 02:22:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Is it an ego thing?</v>

5223
02:22:55.730 --> 02:22:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Is it your identity that holds you back?</v>

5224
02:22:57.930 --> 02:23:01.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the amount of time and energy that you put towards something and</v>

5225
02:23:01.471 --> 02:23:03.300
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you're willing to be obsessed by it.</v>

5226
02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:04.613
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5227
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:09.480
<v Speaker 1>And I think that some parents and some people that are adults just do not have</v>

5228
02:23:09.481 --> 02:23:12.990
<v Speaker 1>the same kind of time that a nine year old has to think about things all day.</v>

5229
02:23:12.990 --> 02:23:14.730
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the same amount of things in their head.</v>

5230
02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:16.020
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the same,</v>

5231
02:23:16.050 --> 02:23:19.890
<v Speaker 1>they have too many bills and stresses and distractions and things pulling them</v>

5232
02:23:19.891 --> 02:23:23.970
<v Speaker 1>away and different angles and they don't have this sense of who they are.</v>

5233
02:23:23.971 --> 02:23:24.460
<v Speaker 1>The way of,</v>

5234
02:23:24.460 --> 02:23:24.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5235
02:23:24.690 --> 02:23:28.230
<v Speaker 1>an adult does that sense of who you are can be very limiting.</v>

5236
02:23:28.440 --> 02:23:31.170
<v Speaker 1>You can have this decision that you have in your head.</v>

5237
02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:32.320
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

5238
02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:32.941
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

5239
02:23:32.941 --> 02:23:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5240
02:23:33.150 --> 02:23:33.871
<v Speaker 1>That's a big part of it.</v>

5241
02:23:33.871 --> 02:23:35.640
<v Speaker 1>They've done a study on that.</v>

5242
02:23:35.641 --> 02:23:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a huge body of study on how,</v>

5243
02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:42.710
<v Speaker 1>what conditions are the most effective to learn it.</v>

5244
02:23:42.760 --> 02:23:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've done a lot of work on this and one of the main things that lends</v>

5245
02:23:47.761 --> 02:23:52.160
<v Speaker 1>itself to learning fast and well is just the idea that you're,</v>

5246
02:23:52.200 --> 02:23:54.150
<v Speaker 1>you're psychologically safe.</v>

5247
02:23:54.151 --> 02:23:54.930
<v Speaker 1>The idea that,</v>

5248
02:23:54.930 --> 02:23:55.763
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

5249
02:23:55.890 --> 02:23:57.960
<v Speaker 1>there's no shame in making mistakes.</v>

5250
02:23:57.980 --> 02:23:58.111
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5251
02:23:58.111 --> 02:23:59.010
<v Speaker 1>That's huge.</v>

5252
02:23:59.011 --> 02:24:00.000
<v Speaker 1>Can Be afraid to fail.</v>

5253
02:24:00.090 --> 02:24:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5254
02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:00.781
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5255
02:24:00.781 --> 02:24:01.650
<v Speaker 1>And you will fail.</v>

5256
02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:03.930
<v Speaker 1>But it has to be competition to look.</v>

5257
02:24:03.931 --> 02:24:04.471
<v Speaker 1>It has to be,</v>

5258
02:24:04.471 --> 02:24:06.390
<v Speaker 1>it has to feel like shit when you do fail.</v>

5259
02:24:06.510 --> 02:24:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Cause if it doesn't feel like shit when you fail,</v>

5260
02:24:08.041 --> 02:24:08.670
<v Speaker 1>like there's,</v>

5261
02:24:08.670 --> 02:24:11.250
<v Speaker 1>there's always the thing on AgLearn you learn when you win,</v>

5262
02:24:11.251 --> 02:24:12.660
<v Speaker 1>but you learn more when you lose,</v>

5263
02:24:13.170 --> 02:24:16.800
<v Speaker 1>you learn a lot more than I think failing and feeling like shit is important to</v>

5264
02:24:16.801 --> 02:24:17.970
<v Speaker 1>re re-energize,</v>

5265
02:24:17.971 --> 02:24:21.960
<v Speaker 1>remotivate refocus and then to recognize this is a bad feeling.</v>

5266
02:24:21.961 --> 02:24:23.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't like this feeling.</v>

5267
02:24:23.160 --> 02:24:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I have to work harder,</v>

5268
02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:25.920
<v Speaker 1>truly repercussions to,</v>

5269
02:24:25.921 --> 02:24:27.960
<v Speaker 1>you know that's true.</v>

5270
02:24:27.961 --> 02:24:28.681
<v Speaker 1>But you need somebody,</v>

5271
02:24:28.681 --> 02:24:29.670
<v Speaker 1>if you're a young person,</v>

5272
02:24:29.671 --> 02:24:33.060
<v Speaker 1>you need somebody to help you navigate out of that space because don't,</v>

5273
02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:33.690
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>

5274
02:24:33.690 --> 02:24:35.180
<v Speaker 1>you feel like shit and then your shame,</v>

5275
02:24:35.200 --> 02:24:35.910
<v Speaker 1>you're told,</v>

5276
02:24:35.910 --> 02:24:36.421
<v Speaker 1>you're told,</v>

5277
02:24:36.421 --> 02:24:38.100
<v Speaker 1>usually you're just not as good.</v>

5278
02:24:38.130 --> 02:24:38.401
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

5279
02:24:38.401 --> 02:24:38.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

5280
02:24:38.670 --> 02:24:40.050
<v Speaker 1>and you're not going to be able to get as good.</v>

5281
02:24:40.260 --> 02:24:41.370
<v Speaker 1>What happens is people quit.</v>

5282
02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Some people though,</v>

5283
02:24:43.410 --> 02:24:44.221
<v Speaker 1>some people,</v>

5284
02:24:44.221 --> 02:24:45.300
<v Speaker 1>some people don't,</v>

5285
02:24:45.301 --> 02:24:48.540
<v Speaker 1>and they dig their heels in and they get stronger demands on the customer.</v>

5286
02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Depends on the person.</v>

5287
02:24:49.441 --> 02:24:51.540
<v Speaker 1>So you need somebody to help you realize,</v>

5288
02:24:51.630 --> 02:24:52.020
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

5289
02:24:52.020 --> 02:24:52.740
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

5290
02:24:52.740 --> 02:24:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Learning is a bitch.</v>

5291
02:24:54.810 --> 02:24:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Learning as a motherfucker,</v>

5292
02:24:56.280 --> 02:24:57.113
<v Speaker 1>don't worry.</v>

5293
02:24:57.240 --> 02:24:58.860
<v Speaker 1>This is part of the process.</v>

5294
02:24:58.861 --> 02:25:00.630
<v Speaker 1>So let me help you navigate your way out.</v>

5295
02:25:00.750 --> 02:25:04.950
<v Speaker 1>So the biggest thing that they always do is make you realize that mistakes are</v>

5296
02:25:05.490 --> 02:25:06.750
<v Speaker 1>necessary,</v>

5297
02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:09.750
<v Speaker 1>important and just as good at this stage,</v>

5298
02:25:09.751 --> 02:25:10.680
<v Speaker 1>they feel like shit.</v>

5299
02:25:10.681 --> 02:25:11.514
<v Speaker 1>Of course they do.</v>

5300
02:25:11.610 --> 02:25:13.290
<v Speaker 1>They come with all kinds of weird feelings.</v>

5301
02:25:13.710 --> 02:25:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Let's stay in this stand,</v>

5302
02:25:15.810 --> 02:25:16.200
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

5303
02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:16.801
<v Speaker 1>learn how to stay.</v>

5304
02:25:16.801 --> 02:25:19.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm comfortable in this and let's figure out a way to get the fuck out of this</v>

5305
02:25:20.150 --> 02:25:21.450
<v Speaker 1>because the real killers,</v>

5306
02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:22.291
<v Speaker 1>the real winners,</v>

5307
02:25:22.291 --> 02:25:24.730
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be killers in winners in any sort of scenario,</v>

5308
02:25:24.731 --> 02:25:27.940
<v Speaker 1>but you can develop more winners if you have a better structure,</v>

5309
02:25:28.400 --> 02:25:29.680
<v Speaker 1>a better learning environment,</v>

5310
02:25:29.710 --> 02:25:29.921
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

5311
02:25:29.921 --> 02:25:30.321
<v Speaker 1>you'll have,</v>

5312
02:25:30.321 --> 02:25:32.470
<v Speaker 1>and then also the community will be better.</v>

5313
02:25:32.740 --> 02:25:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

5314
02:25:33.110 --> 02:25:34.540
<v Speaker 1>it says we keep coming back to that,</v>

5315
02:25:34.541 --> 02:25:38.170
<v Speaker 1>but I think this is God damn gigantic and we're not just talking about community</v>

5316
02:25:38.171 --> 02:25:41.530
<v Speaker 1>in the sense of people that know each other like in an one on one individual</v>

5317
02:25:41.531 --> 02:25:42.220
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

5318
02:25:42.220 --> 02:25:42.401
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5319
02:25:42.401 --> 02:25:44.950
<v Speaker 1>you guys have done with your podcast is creative community.</v>

5320
02:25:44.951 --> 02:25:46.900
<v Speaker 1>I see the community interacting with itself.</v>

5321
02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:49.090
<v Speaker 1>I see you guys interacting with your fans,</v>

5322
02:25:49.091 --> 02:25:49.361
<v Speaker 1>like you've,</v>

5323
02:25:49.361 --> 02:25:51.400
<v Speaker 1>you've made a community of fun,</v>

5324
02:25:51.401 --> 02:25:53.710
<v Speaker 1>silly people that get together when they come to see your shuts.</v>

5325
02:25:53.711 --> 02:25:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Cause he and our silly yeah,</v>

5326
02:25:56.230 --> 02:25:57.063
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

5327
02:25:57.070 --> 02:25:57.880
<v Speaker 1>But this is,</v>

5328
02:25:57.880 --> 02:25:59.110
<v Speaker 1>this is also community.</v>

5329
02:25:59.180 --> 02:26:01.930
<v Speaker 1>This is even people that don't physically know each other,</v>

5330
02:26:02.110 --> 02:26:03.790
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a thing,</v>

5331
02:26:04.030 --> 02:26:04.331
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

5332
02:26:04.331 --> 02:26:09.040
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that that is one of the least discussed,</v>

5333
02:26:09.041 --> 02:26:14.041
<v Speaker 1>but most important parts of happiness and a part of and most important parts of</v>

5334
02:26:14.561 --> 02:26:16.840
<v Speaker 1>developing its community.</v>

5335
02:26:16.870 --> 02:26:17.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5336
02:26:17.260 --> 02:26:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Giant.</v>

02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:18.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5338
02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:19.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5339
02:26:19.091 --> 02:26:19.660
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

5340
02:26:19.660 --> 02:26:20.770
<v Speaker 1>And also like learning,</v>

5341
02:26:20.890 --> 02:26:25.610
<v Speaker 1>like we had a really good discussion about the podcast and it was funny how I'm</v>

<v Speaker 1>but we didn't create this thing to decide what people like and what don't like.</v>

5388
02:27:25.420 --> 02:27:29.230
<v Speaker 1>If you want to do fucking an hour of what you want to do,</v>

5389
02:27:29.260 --> 02:27:29.900
<v Speaker 1>we're doing that.</v>

5390
02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:30.190
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

5391
02:27:30.190 --> 02:27:31.570
<v Speaker 1>we're doing what we want to do.</v>

5392
02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:32.441
<v Speaker 1>If they like it,</v>

5393
02:27:32.441 --> 02:27:32.681
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

5394
02:27:32.681 --> 02:27:34.140
<v Speaker 1>but that's how this thing got to it.</v>

5395
02:27:34.630 --> 02:27:35.780
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to do whatever you want to do.</v>

5396
02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:37.420
<v Speaker 1>That being said,</v>

5397
02:27:38.210 --> 02:27:39.850
<v Speaker 1>he got to quit doing that.</v>

5398
02:27:39.910 --> 02:27:40.141
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5399
02:27:40.141 --> 02:27:40.960
<v Speaker 1>but that being said,</v>

5400
02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:41.741
<v Speaker 1>you've got gotta be responsive.</v>

5401
02:27:41.741 --> 02:27:41.861
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5402
02:27:41.861 --> 02:27:42.341
<v Speaker 1>I just told him,</v>

5403
02:27:42.341 --> 02:27:42.551
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

5404
02:27:42.551 --> 02:27:43.270
<v Speaker 1>if you want to do it,</v>

5405
02:27:43.270 --> 02:27:44.150
<v Speaker 1>do it down.</v>

5406
02:27:44.170 --> 02:27:45.850
<v Speaker 1>But here's the feedback.</v>

5407
02:27:45.851 --> 02:27:46.301
<v Speaker 1>We're good.</v>

5408
02:27:46.301 --> 02:27:46.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5409
02:27:46.481 --> 02:27:47.101
<v Speaker 1>Be Responsible.</v>

5410
02:27:47.101 --> 02:27:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Let's do what you want to do though.</v>

5411
02:27:48.730 --> 02:27:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Here's the evidence.</v>

5412
02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5413
02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:51.810
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're not going to be responsible either,</v>

5414
02:27:51.890 --> 02:27:52.670
<v Speaker 1>but here's the evidence,</v>

5415
02:27:52.670 --> 02:27:56.270
<v Speaker 1>he'd done it again and just keep doing your own thing.</v>

5416
02:27:56.470 --> 02:27:56.790
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>

5417
02:27:56.790 --> 02:27:57.940
<v Speaker 1>you'll peep when I,</v>

5418
02:27:57.970 --> 02:27:59.170
<v Speaker 1>when a signal at you,</v>

5419
02:27:59.171 --> 02:28:01.840
<v Speaker 1>you'll peep when I signal at you otherwise.</v>

5420
02:28:01.841 --> 02:28:03.190
<v Speaker 1>But that's why we've,</v>

5421
02:28:03.370 --> 02:28:05.600
<v Speaker 1>we've never had that issue rec out.</v>

5422
02:28:05.650 --> 02:28:05.951
<v Speaker 1>We got,</v>

5423
02:28:05.951 --> 02:28:06.890

5424
02:28:06.900 --> 02:28:09.820

02:30:43.250 --> 02:30:44.210
<v Speaker 1>that makes him uncomfortable.</v>

5531
02:30:44.510 --> 02:30:45.620
<v Speaker 1>He's so much funnier though.</v>

5532
02:30:45.621 --> 02:30:46.970
<v Speaker 1>So he wins in for an hour.</v>

5533
02:30:46.971 --> 02:30:48.950
<v Speaker 1>He's funnier for now.</v>

5534
02:30:50.640 --> 02:30:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Does it comedy as well as I do.</v>

5535
02:30:52.431 --> 02:30:52.791
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>

5536
02:30:52.791 --> 02:30:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Y'all better.</v>

5537
02:30:53.450 --> 02:30:53.751
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

5538
02:30:53.751 --> 02:30:56.870
<v Speaker 1>I do look shop once a day and I do.</v>

5539
02:30:56.900 --> 02:30:57.800
<v Speaker 1>It does cross my mind.</v>

5540
02:30:57.801 --> 02:30:58.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm always like he could,</v>

5541
02:30:59.450 --> 02:31:01.610
<v Speaker 1>he could stifle my life with his hands.</v>

5542
02:31:01.790 --> 02:31:02.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5543
02:31:02.061 --> 02:31:02.790
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

5544
02:31:02.790 --> 02:31:04.460
<v Speaker 1>that part is a given.</v>

5545
02:31:04.730 --> 02:31:07.910
<v Speaker 1>But you should be in admiration of what he's doing,</v>

5546
02:31:07.911 --> 02:31:08.720
<v Speaker 1>but stand up.</v>

5547
02:31:08.720 --> 02:31:09.560
<v Speaker 1>He's hustling.</v>

5548
02:31:09.580 --> 02:31:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I'll come on.</v>

5549
02:31:10.110 --> 02:31:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Who is his biggest supporter will tell you,</v>

5550
02:31:11.901 --> 02:31:12.320
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

5551
02:31:12.320 --> 02:31:13.153
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>

5552
02:31:13.160 --> 02:31:14.990
<v Speaker 1>You're not his biggest support and might be.</v>

5553
02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:15.873
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

5554
02:31:16.940 --> 02:31:18.920
<v Speaker 1>but I'm 100% mother.</v>

5555
02:31:19.410 --> 02:31:20.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100%</v>

5556
02:31:20.070 --> 02:31:20.600
<v Speaker 2>positive.</v>

5557
02:31:20.600 --> 02:31:21.433
<v Speaker 2>You're not</v>

5558
02:31:22.840 --> 02:31:23.790
<v Speaker 2>100% positive.</v>

5559
02:31:23.791 --> 02:31:28.140
<v Speaker 2>You're calling them brode pop and he's a roadblock.</v>

5560
02:31:31.430 --> 02:31:31.800
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>

5561
02:31:31.800 --> 02:31:32.100
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

5562
02:31:32.100 --> 02:31:35.020
<v Speaker 2>this is like my mom and dad fight my room.</v>

5563
02:31:35.250 --> 02:31:36.780
<v Speaker 2>You're a fucking coward right now.</v>

5564
02:31:38.190 --> 02:31:38.731
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this.</v>

5565
02:31:38.731 --> 02:31:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever open up for Brendan anywhere?</v>

5566
02:31:41.450 --> 02:31:41.910
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

5567
02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:42.361
<v Speaker 2>I might be.</v>

5568
02:31:42.361 --> 02:31:43.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm opening up for him in the future.</v>

5569
02:31:43.741 --> 02:31:44.610
<v Speaker 2>I've got a Gig.</v>

5570
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:46.410
<v Speaker 2>He and I are going for me to actually,</v>

5571
02:31:46.470 --> 02:31:48.030
<v Speaker 2>I did open up for you when you did.</v>

5572
02:31:48.031 --> 02:31:49.090
<v Speaker 2>You're a standup special.</v>

5573
02:31:49.840 --> 02:31:50.673
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>

5574
02:31:51.130 --> 02:31:53.690
<v Speaker 2>We can get related to open it up for Brendan on the sneaker.</v>

5575
02:31:53.790 --> 02:31:56.730
<v Speaker 2>We can get one of the biggest fucking comics to open for us.</v>

5576
02:31:56.731 --> 02:31:57.564
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>

5577
02:31:57.870 --> 02:31:58.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm fortunate,</v>

5578
02:31:58.711 --> 02:31:58.860
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5579
02:31:58.860 --> 02:32:00.210
<v Speaker 2>Rogan would actually do that for us.</v>

5580
02:32:00.540 --> 02:32:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5581
02:32:01.010 --> 02:32:02.550
<v Speaker 2>I really need my open up for you.</v>

5582
02:32:02.610 --> 02:32:06.210
<v Speaker 2>It was the first time it opened for anybody in like 29 years.</v>

5583
02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:10.350
<v Speaker 2>It's the first time I ever went on stage without anybody going on before me.</v>

5584
02:32:10.470 --> 02:32:12.450
<v Speaker 2>I know like you really like that's a hard gig.</v>

5585
02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:14.670
<v Speaker 2>Like the opening spot is a little more difficult,</v>

5586
02:32:14.671 --> 02:32:16.280
<v Speaker 2>so you gotta like juice the audience up.</v>

5587
02:32:16.290 --> 02:32:17.040
<v Speaker 2>You've got to get them.</v>

5588
02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:17.610
<v Speaker 2>It's an art.</v>

5589
02:32:17.610 --> 02:32:20.760
<v Speaker 2>There's an art form to smoothing them into the show.</v>

5590
02:32:20.880 --> 02:32:21.870
<v Speaker 2>I just learned that,</v>

5591
02:32:21.871 --> 02:32:22.950
<v Speaker 2>so I bring someone on the road,</v>

5592
02:32:23.010 --> 02:32:23.611
<v Speaker 2>but she was like,</v>

5593
02:32:23.611 --> 02:32:24.031
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>

5594
02:32:24.031 --> 02:32:25.260
<v Speaker 2>you're just going out there cold and like,</v>

5595
02:32:25.261 --> 02:32:25.381
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5596
02:32:25.381 --> 02:32:26.131
<v Speaker 2>I just do my thing.</v>

5597
02:32:26.131 --> 02:32:26.530
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

5598
02:32:26.530 --> 02:32:27.000
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5599
02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:27.241
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5600
02:32:27.241 --> 02:32:28.074
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

5601
02:32:28.450 --> 02:32:28.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5602
02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Then you do it like some guys like bill Cosby to the end always just went on</v>

5603
02:32:33.961 --> 02:32:34.380
<v Speaker 2>stage.</v>

5604
02:32:34.380 --> 02:32:34.891
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

5605
02:32:34.891 --> 02:32:35.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5606
02:32:35.220 --> 02:32:36.270
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have an opening act.</v>

5607
02:32:36.390 --> 02:32:39.210
<v Speaker 2>Bill Cosby would go on stage for like two fucking hours.</v>

5608
02:32:39.211 --> 02:32:40.590
<v Speaker 2>He was a hundred thousand years old.</v>

5609
02:32:40.591 --> 02:32:44.130
<v Speaker 2>He would go on stage for two hours with one eyeball and a hello spreads shirt</v>

5610
02:32:44.430 --> 02:32:46.950
<v Speaker 2>with a backlog of rape in his hand.</v>

5611
02:32:47.310 --> 02:32:51.870
<v Speaker 2>Somehow the fought through that I knew to deliver this family friendly humor,</v>

5612
02:32:52.700 --> 02:32:55.910
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest comics of all.</v>

5613
02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:59.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like the most prolific and it goes to your point that you can be more than</v>

5614
02:32:59.521 --> 02:33:00.001
<v Speaker 2>one thing.</v>

5615
02:33:00.001 --> 02:33:01.290
<v Speaker 2>It can be evil and good,</v>

5616
02:33:01.610 --> 02:33:01.981
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

5617
02:33:01.981 --> 02:33:02.221
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5618
02:33:02.221 --> 02:33:04.190
<v Speaker 2>he was a great classic example.</v>

5619
02:33:05.250 --> 02:33:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Damn Dude.</v>

5620
02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:07.860
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Dude and no opening act.</v>

5621
02:33:07.861 --> 02:33:08.820
<v Speaker 2>Look at that hello friend.</v>

5622
02:33:09.130 --> 02:33:09.711
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5623
02:33:09.711 --> 02:33:10.800
<v Speaker 2>On stage like that.</v>

5624
02:33:10.830 --> 02:33:11.663
<v Speaker 2>Just with uh,</v>

5625
02:33:11.730 --> 02:33:12.391
<v Speaker 2>two hours.</v>

5626
02:33:12.391 --> 02:33:17.310
<v Speaker 2>Who knows how many rapes in his memory banks just crushing his self esteem and</v>

5627
02:33:17.311 --> 02:33:19.260
<v Speaker 2>sought process and activity.</v>

5628
02:33:19.470 --> 02:33:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Had he been been accused when he was doing standup as well?</v>

5629
02:33:22.410 --> 02:33:23.243
<v Speaker 2>Here's the crazy,</v>

5630
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:24.070
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

5631
02:33:24.070 --> 02:33:24.780
<v Speaker 2>he'd been accused.</v>

5632
02:33:24.780 --> 02:33:29.780
<v Speaker 2>He's blind in one eye and losing his vision in the second on how these very old,</v>

5633
02:33:30.300 --> 02:33:32.120
<v Speaker 2>but I think he's also pour it.</v>

5634
02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:32.311
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5635
02:33:32.311 --> 02:33:32.851
<v Speaker 2>he's still alive.</v>

5636
02:33:32.851 --> 02:33:34.800
<v Speaker 2>He's still went through the trial.</v>

5637
02:33:34.970 --> 02:33:36.620
<v Speaker 2>He did through one trial,</v>

5638
02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:38.850
<v Speaker 2>his trial and then their retrying him again.</v>

5639
02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:40.193
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

5640
02:33:40.650 --> 02:33:41.850
<v Speaker 2>I want to say it's coming up soon.</v>

5641
02:33:41.880 --> 02:33:45.540
<v Speaker 2>That's stress usually kills those look like Joe Paterno.</v>

5642
02:33:45.541 --> 02:33:46.201
<v Speaker 2>These that'll break.</v>

5643
02:33:46.201 --> 02:33:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

5644
02:33:47.461 --> 02:33:48.294
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

5645
02:33:48.310 --> 02:33:50.670
<v Speaker 2>Do you imagine a body of work though?</v>

5646
02:33:50.671 --> 02:33:51.750
<v Speaker 2>And then Justin matter,</v>

5647
02:33:51.751 --> 02:33:52.600
<v Speaker 2>but that's a TC.</v>

5648
02:33:52.980 --> 02:33:54.720
<v Speaker 2>It's what is the human being,</v>

5649
02:33:54.750 --> 02:33:55.021
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5650
02:33:55.021 --> 02:33:58.680
<v Speaker 2>What does it human being capable of and the lowest thing you can do to someone</v>

5651
02:33:58.681 --> 02:34:02.160
<v Speaker 2>besides murder them is rape and two drug.</v>

5652
02:34:02.161 --> 02:34:04.680
<v Speaker 2>All these women that you took in there,</v>

5653
02:34:04.710 --> 02:34:08.900
<v Speaker 2>they were like confiding in you because you're this great master of show</v>

5654
02:34:08.901 --> 02:34:09.411
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

5655
02:34:09.411 --> 02:34:10.710
<v Speaker 2>You were Mr Hawks to blink.</v>

5656
02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:11.760
<v Speaker 2>You would never believe it.</v>

5657
02:34:11.790 --> 02:34:13.110
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't marry somebody told you,</v>

5658
02:34:13.111 --> 02:34:14.160
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like shut up.</v>

5659
02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:15.233
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>

5660
02:34:15.290 --> 02:34:17.190
<v Speaker 2>The earth is flat before a bill Cosby.</v>

5661
02:34:17.470 --> 02:34:18.490
<v Speaker 2>That makes it easy.</v>

5662
02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:21.190
<v Speaker 2>But don't you think this is a part of what we were talking about earlier is that</v>

5663
02:34:21.191 --> 02:34:23.020
<v Speaker 2>the more information that gets out,</v>

5664
02:34:23.050 --> 02:34:27.160
<v Speaker 2>the more you understand like the Harvey Weinsteins are the bill Cosby's of the</v>

5665
02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:27.890
<v Speaker 2>evil people,</v>

5666
02:34:27.890 --> 02:34:31.360
<v Speaker 2>the world that have gotten away with it for so long because the power,</v>

5667
02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:34.180
<v Speaker 2>but the more this stuff comes out,</v>

5668
02:34:34.181 --> 02:34:34.750
<v Speaker 2>the more we'll have.</v>

5669
02:34:34.750 --> 02:34:38.080
<v Speaker 2>We have a more nuanced understanding of what a human being is.</v>

5670
02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Like Neal Brennan was talking about,</v>

5671
02:34:39.730 --> 02:34:40.760
<v Speaker 2>we were talking to the podcast,</v>

5672
02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:41.860
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about Louis Ck.</v>

5673
02:34:41.890 --> 02:34:42.371
<v Speaker 2>I love him too.</v>

5674
02:34:42.371 --> 02:34:43.204
<v Speaker 2>He's great.</v>

5675
02:34:43.330 --> 02:34:44.081
<v Speaker 2>And we were talking about like,</v>

5676
02:34:44.081 --> 02:34:46.930
<v Speaker 2>do you think that it's possible to be a really great comic?</v>

5677
02:34:46.931 --> 02:34:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Not Be fucked up in some way and I was like,</v>

5678
02:34:49.481 --> 02:34:50.314
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5679
02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:51.610
<v Speaker 2>never met one,</v>

5680
02:34:51.940 --> 02:34:52.570
<v Speaker 2>never met one.</v>

5681
02:34:52.570 --> 02:34:53.650
<v Speaker 2>It might be possible.</v>

5682
02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:54.491
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen it.</v>

5683
02:34:54.491 --> 02:34:59.491
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something about wanting to crush on stage and figuring out like</v>

5684
02:34:59.621 --> 02:35:03.610
<v Speaker 2>how to do it and having those thoughts inside you that people find so humorous,</v>

5685
02:35:03.850 --> 02:35:07.690
<v Speaker 2>those crazy impulsive thoughts and those,</v>

5686
02:35:07.750 --> 02:35:08.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5687
02:35:08.261 --> 02:35:13.180
<v Speaker 2>like deeply disturbing thoughts sometimes where you're just scratching the base</v>

5688
02:35:13.181 --> 02:35:16.600
<v Speaker 2>layers of your psychology and looking to see what makes it bleed.</v>

5689
02:35:17.170 --> 02:35:17.870
<v Speaker 2>You know though,</v>

5690
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:22.180
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to find that place when you're a regular person with a regular</v>

5691
02:35:22.181 --> 02:35:23.980
<v Speaker 2>sensibilities and you fit into this,</v>

5692
02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:24.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5693
02:35:24.580 --> 02:35:27.700
<v Speaker 2>normal pattern me and might every now and then get a really funny guy who comes</v>

5694
02:35:27.701 --> 02:35:28.360
<v Speaker 2>out of that,</v>

5695
02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:29.920
<v Speaker 2>but most of them when you get to know them,</v>

5696
02:35:29.921 --> 02:35:31.450
<v Speaker 2>you find some dark shit,</v>

5697
02:35:31.451 --> 02:35:33.070
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent artist,</v>

5698
02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:37.450
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional shit or unorthodox trying to fill some hole.</v>

5699
02:35:37.470 --> 02:35:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5700
02:35:38.200 --> 02:35:41.410
<v Speaker 2>just almost different way of looking at the all is in the outside.</v>

5701
02:35:41.500 --> 02:35:43.720
<v Speaker 2>Outsiders outside of fighters as well.</v>

5702
02:35:43.721 --> 02:35:44.351
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>

5703
02:35:44.351 --> 02:35:47.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know any fighters at somewhere in the back of their head.</v>

5704
02:35:47.740 --> 02:35:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Do they not have this,</v>

5705
02:35:48.881 --> 02:35:50.920
<v Speaker 2>this one area where like,</v>

5706
02:35:50.950 --> 02:35:51.131
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5707
02:35:51.131 --> 02:35:51.970
<v Speaker 2>you got this spot.</v>

5708
02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't have that spot.</v>

5709
02:35:53.260 --> 02:35:55.660
<v Speaker 2>It was like this one area of darkness.</v>

5710
02:35:55.690 --> 02:35:56.290
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5711
02:35:56.290 --> 02:35:56.900
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

5712
02:35:56.900 --> 02:35:57.733
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5713
02:35:58.150 --> 02:36:02.350
<v Speaker 2>How many human beings do you think could get to the psychological state that</v>

5714
02:36:02.351 --> 02:36:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Matt Brown gets into in full combat?</v>

5715
02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:06.333
<v Speaker 2>I mean how many,</v>

5716
02:36:06.940 --> 02:36:08.430
<v Speaker 2>how many people have more that?</v>

5717
02:36:08.650 --> 02:36:12.370
<v Speaker 2>How many people have that level of violence in their head?</v>

5718
02:36:12.371 --> 02:36:13.630
<v Speaker 2>In the face of like,</v>

5719
02:36:13.900 --> 02:36:15.580
<v Speaker 2>like real world class fighters.</v>

5720
02:36:15.880 --> 02:36:19.690
<v Speaker 2>The one thing that I love about Matt Brown is every map Brown fight was a</v>

5721
02:36:19.691 --> 02:36:22.190
<v Speaker 2>motherfucking Matt Brown fight and he knew it.</v>

5722
02:36:22.340 --> 02:36:23.500
<v Speaker 2>He didn't seem to go in the cage like,</v>

5723
02:36:23.501 --> 02:36:24.334
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5724
02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:25.840
<v Speaker 2>good for chaos.</v>

5725
02:36:25.870 --> 02:36:28.990
<v Speaker 2>You see how he got into the cage during his last fight with Diego Sanchez?</v>

5726
02:36:29.380 --> 02:36:30.730
<v Speaker 2>He roars.</v>

5727
02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:31.151
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

5728
02:36:31.151 --> 02:36:34.590
<v Speaker 2>they open up the cage door and he just fucking throws his backed up</v>

5729
02:36:36.610 --> 02:36:37.420
<v Speaker 2>and it's real.</v>

5730
02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:42.420
<v Speaker 2>It's not an act like this guy don it at that level and he's lost and he's one,</v>

5731
02:36:43.510 --> 02:36:44.620
<v Speaker 2>he said ups and downs.</v>

5732
02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Never a physically gifted guy.</v>

5733
02:36:46.810 --> 02:36:48.460
<v Speaker 2>Not like some insanely fast,</v>

5734
02:36:48.640 --> 02:36:49.540
<v Speaker 2>crazy athletics,</v>

5735
02:36:50.110 --> 02:36:55.110
<v Speaker 2>just explosive and Ahmad Rawhide and steel cable and it's got a place that Bob</v>

5736
02:36:57.280 --> 02:37:01.840
<v Speaker 2>works in accounting and you know it was his wife is fucking our personal trainer</v>

5737
02:37:01.841 --> 02:37:04.930
<v Speaker 2>and his kids call him a piece of shit and he takes a Xanax every night.</v>

5738
02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Rob Doesn't have that place has brain Jamie,</v>

5739
02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Jamie bring up,</v>

5740
02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:10.480
<v Speaker 2>bring up Salma Hayek.</v>

5741
02:37:10.481 --> 02:37:12.100
<v Speaker 2>He was my monster too.</v>

5742
02:37:12.250 --> 02:37:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

5743
02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:15.190
<v Speaker 2>She says something about Harvey Weinstein.</v>

5744
02:37:15.200 --> 02:37:15.981
<v Speaker 2>That's to your point.</v>

5745
02:37:15.981 --> 02:37:16.730
<v Speaker 2>Then she say,</v>

5746
02:37:16.730 --> 02:37:17.660
<v Speaker 2>so she said,</v>

5747
02:37:17.730 --> 02:37:18.563
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5748
02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:19.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a one sentence,</v>

5749
02:37:19.731 --> 02:37:20.660
<v Speaker 2>but it says everything.</v>

5750
02:37:20.660 --> 02:37:21.700
<v Speaker 2>It's the first time we do that.</v>

5751
02:37:21.701 --> 02:37:23.030
<v Speaker 2>I want to see Matt Brown roar.</v>

5752
02:37:23.180 --> 02:37:24.260
<v Speaker 2>You can't supersede the seat.</v>

5753
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:28.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to piggy back on it trying to find it.</v>

5754
02:37:28.870 --> 02:37:30.110
<v Speaker 2>Do we need another guy?</v>

5755
02:37:30.140 --> 02:37:30.973
<v Speaker 2>He retired.</v>

5756
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5757
02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:32.631
<v Speaker 2>he knows.</v>

5758
02:37:32.631 --> 02:37:33.141
<v Speaker 2>No though.</v>

5759
02:37:33.141 --> 02:37:34.220
<v Speaker 2>I talked to him in Boston.</v>

5760
02:37:34.221 --> 02:37:37.460
<v Speaker 2>He came to my show in Boston and we actually talked on the phone,</v>

5761
02:37:37.650 --> 02:37:38.690
<v Speaker 2>but he was saying,</v>

5762
02:37:38.691 --> 02:37:39.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man.</v>

5763
02:37:39.561 --> 02:37:39.851
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

5764
02:37:39.851 --> 02:37:40.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5765
02:37:40.640 --> 02:37:41.140
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

5766
02:37:41.140 --> 02:37:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5767
02:37:41.660 --> 02:37:43.160
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking of retiring,</v>

5768
02:37:43.190 --> 02:37:44.220
<v Speaker 2>but now I'm not sure.</v>

5769
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:48.920
<v Speaker 2>It's tough if you're thinking about it to his brother when he smashed Diego</v>

5770
02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:50.240
<v Speaker 2>Sanchez with the craziest elbow,</v>

5771
02:37:50.540 --> 02:37:50.841
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

5772
02:37:50.841 --> 02:37:51.321
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

5773
02:37:51.321 --> 02:37:52.010
<v Speaker 2>it was so crazy.</v>

5774
02:37:52.010 --> 02:37:55.120
<v Speaker 2>Here's a thought on that Topo one.</v>

5775
02:37:55.370 --> 02:37:57.500
<v Speaker 2>This has been something that's been going on for awhile.</v>

5776
02:37:58.040 --> 02:38:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Like when is it okay and when is it not okay to hit the back of the head where</v>

5777
02:38:01.401 --> 02:38:02.420
<v Speaker 2>it counts as a Kao,</v>

5778
02:38:03.290 --> 02:38:03.560
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5779
02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Like if you do it on the ground,</v>

5780
02:38:05.180 --> 02:38:07.160
<v Speaker 2>you can get severely disqualified,</v>

5781
02:38:07.420 --> 02:38:08.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5782
02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Dqued or points taken away depending on how much damage due to a person.</v>

5783
02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:13.161
<v Speaker 2>But if you do it,</v>

5784
02:38:13.161 --> 02:38:13.641
<v Speaker 2>stand it up,</v>

5785
02:38:13.641 --> 02:38:14.690
<v Speaker 2>whether it's with a head kick,</v>

5786
02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:16.490
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of times hits the back of the neck,</v>

5787
02:38:16.990 --> 02:38:18.800
<v Speaker 2>it's if it's a movement,</v>

5788
02:38:18.801 --> 02:38:19.230
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5789
02:38:19.230 --> 02:38:21.470
<v Speaker 2>If it's in transition and you hit the elbow,</v>

5790
02:38:21.471 --> 02:38:22.304
<v Speaker 2>you're good,</v>

5791
02:38:23.090 --> 02:38:24.230
<v Speaker 2>but on the ground it's not.</v>

5792
02:38:24.231 --> 02:38:24.951
<v Speaker 2>Here's my point.</v>

5793
02:38:24.951 --> 02:38:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone's squirming on the ground and you throw an elbow and you hit him</v>

5794
02:38:27.351 --> 02:38:28.184
<v Speaker 2>in the back of the head,</v>

5795
02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:29.780
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times they can take points away,</v>

5796
02:38:30.290 --> 02:38:34.760
<v Speaker 2>but isn't there a big difference between doing something on purpose and doing</v>

5797
02:38:34.761 --> 02:38:37.250
<v Speaker 2>something in the the heat of the chaos?</v>

5798
02:38:37.251 --> 02:38:39.860
<v Speaker 2>Why is it okay standing up and I think it is okay.</v>

5799
02:38:40.100 --> 02:38:43.730
<v Speaker 2>I think Matt Blatt Brown's Kao of Diego Sanchez is totally clean,</v>

5800
02:38:44.120 --> 02:38:48.410
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's a reality to that back of the head shot that happens with</v>

5801
02:38:48.411 --> 02:38:50.480
<v Speaker 2>neck kicks all the time,</v>

5802
02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:51.170
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

5803
02:38:51.170 --> 02:38:54.860
<v Speaker 2>There's a reality to the effectiveness of that technique that we accept standing</v>

5804
02:38:54.861 --> 02:38:55.250
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

5805
02:38:55.250 --> 02:38:57.740
<v Speaker 2>but on the ground we limit that.</v>

5806
02:38:57.950 --> 02:39:01.460
<v Speaker 2>I think they're thinking on the ground you have more control of the opponent.</v>

5807
02:39:01.490 --> 02:39:02.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's real.</v>

5808
02:39:02.750 --> 02:39:03.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't either.</v>

5809
02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:04.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's real.</v>

5810
02:39:04.401 --> 02:39:05.061
<v Speaker 2>I think guys,</v>

5811
02:39:05.061 --> 02:39:05.894
<v Speaker 2>when we set up,</v>

5812
02:39:05.930 --> 02:39:09.860
<v Speaker 2>they're bucking and squirming and you're throwing shit and it takes time.</v>

5813
02:39:09.890 --> 02:39:12.080
<v Speaker 2>There's movement here while you're throwing.</v>

5814
02:39:12.081 --> 02:39:15.320
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare that someone's completely stationary while you're throwing.</v>

5815
02:39:15.430 --> 02:39:16.263
<v Speaker 2>They're awesome.</v>

5816
02:39:16.340 --> 02:39:18.140
<v Speaker 2>They're also adjusting their,</v>

5817
02:39:18.141 --> 02:39:20.390
<v Speaker 2>they're going on a big shrimping.</v>

5818
02:39:20.391 --> 02:39:21.111
<v Speaker 2>You're bucking,</v>

5819
02:39:21.111 --> 02:39:22.310
<v Speaker 2>you're dropping down.</v>

5820
02:39:22.460 --> 02:39:24.230
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of shit happened in man.</v>

5821
02:39:24.231 --> 02:39:26.030
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that somehow or another,</v>

5822
02:39:26.031 --> 02:39:29.780
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to control it on the ground when you're actually in physical</v>

5823
02:39:29.781 --> 02:39:30.950
<v Speaker 2>contact with someone,</v>

5824
02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:31.371
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5825
02:39:31.371 --> 02:39:34.550
<v Speaker 2>You have to be physically have their body that you're trying to manipulate and</v>

5826
02:39:34.551 --> 02:39:35.940
<v Speaker 2>control while they're bucking around.</v>

5827
02:39:35.940 --> 02:39:38.420
<v Speaker 2>It's hard versus they don't have any control of your body.</v>

5828
02:39:38.540 --> 02:39:39.470
<v Speaker 2>You're standing up,</v>

5829
02:39:39.500 --> 02:39:40.640
<v Speaker 2>you're away from them.</v>

5830
02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:43.820
<v Speaker 2>And any shot that you landed on the back of the head somehow or another is okay.</v>

5831
02:39:43.821 --> 02:39:47.300
<v Speaker 2>It just shows you we have a little more ways to go with evolution of fighting.</v>

5832
02:39:47.420 --> 02:39:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5833
02:39:47.930 --> 02:39:49.490
<v Speaker 2>I do look at some of the rules and I'm like,</v>

5834
02:39:49.491 --> 02:39:50.690
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

5835
02:39:50.900 --> 02:39:52.010
<v Speaker 2>How do we still have these problems?</v>

5836
02:39:52.100 --> 02:39:52.851
<v Speaker 2>Get judging.</v>

5837
02:39:52.851 --> 02:39:53.061
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

5838
02:39:53.061 --> 02:39:55.200
<v Speaker 2>God damn helmet.</v>

5839
02:39:55.530 --> 02:39:57.740
<v Speaker 2>Could you wear something on the back of your headlight out?</v>

5840
02:39:57.860 --> 02:39:59.630
<v Speaker 2>They used to wear those in taekwondo tournament.</v>

5841
02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:00.950
<v Speaker 2>They used to give people these,</v>

5842
02:40:00.951 --> 02:40:01.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5843
02:40:01.250 --> 02:40:02.083
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't help.</v>

5844
02:40:02.450 --> 02:40:06.230
<v Speaker 2>There's a transition and taekwondo rules where they started getting ready for</v>

5845
02:40:06.231 --> 02:40:07.064
<v Speaker 2>the Olympics,</v>

5846
02:40:07.070 --> 02:40:09.560
<v Speaker 2>where they started making people wear actual helmets.</v>

5847
02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:11.700
<v Speaker 2>You wore these big foam thing,</v>

5848
02:40:11.940 --> 02:40:12.200
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

5849
02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:15.090
<v Speaker 2>But before that you'd have to wear these things in the back of your head.</v>

5850
02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:16.280
<v Speaker 2>The video I have it.</v>

5851
02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:17.670
<v Speaker 2>There's a video of me wearing one.</v>

5852
02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:19.110
<v Speaker 2>The video of me,</v>

5853
02:40:19.680 --> 02:40:22.680
<v Speaker 2>I always liked it better cause it didn't fuck with your peripheral vision.</v>

5854
02:40:22.810 --> 02:40:23.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

5855
02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:25.380
<v Speaker 2>The idea is you get k owed because we're all,</v>

5856
02:40:25.381 --> 02:40:28.650
<v Speaker 2>we were fighting on basketball courts and what guys got Kol?</v>

5857
02:40:28.910 --> 02:40:29.341
<v Speaker 2>Who was he?</v>

5858
02:40:29.341 --> 02:40:30.174
<v Speaker 2>Video me fight.</v>

5859
02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:31.331
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>

5860
02:40:31.331 --> 02:40:32.670
<v Speaker 2>I do watch this.</v>

5861
02:40:32.671 --> 02:40:33.504
<v Speaker 2>This is me.</v>

5862
02:40:35.060 --> 02:40:36.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm the guy with the back to us.</v>

5863
02:40:36.930 --> 02:40:38.160
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at my head,</v>

5864
02:40:38.340 --> 02:40:41.610
<v Speaker 2>that thing in the back of my head is a raw red foam thing.</v>

5865
02:40:41.611 --> 02:40:41.850
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

5866
02:40:41.850 --> 02:40:42.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5867
02:40:42.090 --> 02:40:43.230
<v Speaker 2>shitty old VHS.</v>

5868
02:40:43.610 --> 02:40:48.240
<v Speaker 2>But there's a Yamaka rubber band that goes across my forehead in this pad is</v>

5869
02:40:48.241 --> 02:40:49.350
<v Speaker 2>just to keep my head.</v>

5870
02:40:49.780 --> 02:40:50.581
<v Speaker 2>He just fucked that.</v>

5871
02:40:50.581 --> 02:40:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Get up.</v>

5872
02:40:50.940 --> 02:40:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5873
02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:52.343
<v Speaker 2>How old are you there?</v>

5874
02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:56.850
<v Speaker 2>I was 19 that was at the u s in Connecticut.</v>

5875
02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:58.230
<v Speaker 2>Cc Connecticut on the floor.</v>

5876
02:40:58.290 --> 02:41:00.140
<v Speaker 2>Why'd you walk off like dead?</v>

5877
02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:01.250
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was a rap.</v>

5878
02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:03.080
<v Speaker 2>One of the other guys we shot.</v>

5879
02:41:03.230 --> 02:41:03.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5880
02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Type one and all the other guys to be scared cause I was terrified.</v>

5881
02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:06.833
<v Speaker 2>Fucked up.</v>

5882
02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:07.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5883
02:41:07.141 --> 02:41:07.770
<v Speaker 2>that's a good thing.</v>

5884
02:41:07.770 --> 02:41:11.820
<v Speaker 2>My move was always to pretend like I didn't give a fuck Kao guys and walk away.</v>

5885
02:41:11.821 --> 02:41:12.654
<v Speaker 2>Like it was nothing.</v>

5886
02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:13.710
<v Speaker 2>I never celebrate.</v>

5887
02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Never like it's just another day in the office because it scared the shit out of</v>

5888
02:41:17.521 --> 02:41:17.701
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

5889
02:41:17.701 --> 02:41:19.790
<v Speaker 2>So I was tried to be like one of the guys that scared the shit out of me.</v>

5890
02:41:19.791 --> 02:41:20.624
<v Speaker 2>What I do.</v>

5891
02:41:20.670 --> 02:41:21.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5892
02:41:21.001 --> 02:41:22.080
<v Speaker 2>And then it was what I do.</v>

5893
02:41:22.081 --> 02:41:22.950
<v Speaker 2>But I was like this is weird.</v>

5894
02:41:22.951 --> 02:41:24.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a fraud but I'm not.</v>

5895
02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:26.850
<v Speaker 2>I think those guys are like that.</v>

5896
02:41:27.450 --> 02:41:28.630
<v Speaker 2>Most buyers are like that.</v>

5897
02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:30.030
<v Speaker 2>But those,</v>

5898
02:41:30.030 --> 02:41:35.030
<v Speaker 2>those head things were a standard and then they changed it to pat at floor.</v>

5899
02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:36.540
<v Speaker 2>They changed the floor.</v>

5900
02:41:36.770 --> 02:41:37.650
<v Speaker 2>They used to let you fight.</v>

5901
02:41:37.651 --> 02:41:38.790
<v Speaker 2>Why Fun on a hockey rink.</v>

5902
02:41:39.270 --> 02:41:39.701
<v Speaker 2>I found him,</v>

5903
02:41:39.701 --> 02:41:41.820
<v Speaker 2>the bay state games on concrete,</v>

5904
02:41:41.850 --> 02:41:42.840
<v Speaker 2>there was a plastic,</v>

5905
02:41:42.841 --> 02:41:47.070
<v Speaker 2>a thin plastic sheet that was over concrete and when the dude's head hit the</v>

5906
02:41:47.071 --> 02:41:47.391
<v Speaker 2>mat,</v>

5907
02:41:47.391 --> 02:41:52.110
<v Speaker 2>it cut him open cause like I owed him and when I hit him in the wheel kick,</v>

5908
02:41:52.320 --> 02:41:57.320
<v Speaker 2>his head bounced off the ground and his eyebrow opened up from contacting the</v>

5909
02:41:58.201 --> 02:41:59.034
<v Speaker 2>concrete.</v>

5910
02:41:59.190 --> 02:42:01.200
<v Speaker 2>It was so disturbing.</v>

5911
02:42:01.540 --> 02:42:03.450
<v Speaker 2>It was like that easily could have been me.</v>

5912
02:42:03.750 --> 02:42:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I easily could've got head kicked and my head bounces off the fucking concrete.</v>

5913
02:42:08.430 --> 02:42:09.330
<v Speaker 2>That was like practice.</v>

5914
02:42:09.331 --> 02:42:10.810
<v Speaker 2>When you go to practice and tackle known,</v>

5915
02:42:10.820 --> 02:42:13.680
<v Speaker 2>you knew you were going to spar somebody who's going to get kicked in the head</v>

5916
02:42:13.681 --> 02:42:15.750
<v Speaker 2>if they weren't careful when somebody would do the chicken,</v>

5917
02:42:15.751 --> 02:42:15.991
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

5918
02:42:15.991 --> 02:42:20.340
<v Speaker 2>they would always be a guy once a month would get hit and just it was what you</v>

5919
02:42:20.341 --> 02:42:21.560
<v Speaker 2>guys were that had get her.</v>

5920
02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Now my tier helps.</v>

5921
02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:24.870
<v Speaker 2>It definitely helps.</v>

5922
02:42:24.871 --> 02:42:26.460
<v Speaker 2>Like it'll protect your head a little bit.</v>

5923
02:42:26.850 --> 02:42:29.880
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely better than nothing but getting kicked out because they're</v>

5924
02:42:29.881 --> 02:42:30.714
<v Speaker 2>pretty sweet though.</v>

5925
02:42:31.230 --> 02:42:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Here's Matt Brown.</v>

5926
02:42:32.370 --> 02:42:33.031
<v Speaker 2>Here's Matt Brown.</v>

5927
02:42:33.031 --> 02:42:34.920
<v Speaker 2>When he steps in to fight Diego Sanchez,</v>

5928
02:42:34.921 --> 02:42:36.300
<v Speaker 2>he roars the head coach.</v>

5929
02:42:36.301 --> 02:42:37.260
<v Speaker 2>Now they're in Denver.</v>

5930
02:42:37.990 --> 02:42:38.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5931
02:42:38.370 --> 02:42:41.190
<v Speaker 2>he's definitely one of the top coaches over there.</v>

5932
02:42:41.191 --> 02:42:43.590
<v Speaker 2>And didn't they just open up a place here?</v>

5933
02:42:43.740 --> 02:42:43.950
<v Speaker 2>Hit,</v>

5934
02:42:43.950 --> 02:42:45.600
<v Speaker 2>did they somewhere around self harm?</v>

5935
02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:47.640
<v Speaker 2>I think they opened up a place in Burbank.</v>

5936
02:42:47.670 --> 02:42:49.440
<v Speaker 2>He's such a fucking animal.</v>

5937
02:42:49.460 --> 02:42:51.390
<v Speaker 2>This is what one of my all time favorite.</v>

5938
02:42:51.450 --> 02:42:53.180
<v Speaker 2>He just cause I gotta check my Dick.</v>

5939
02:42:53.740 --> 02:42:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Cause like,</v>

5940
02:42:53.980 --> 02:42:54.810
<v Speaker 2>cause you have a cup on.</v>

5941
02:42:54.810 --> 02:42:56.370
<v Speaker 2>He goes yes and taps his own dick.</v>

5942
02:42:56.580 --> 02:42:59.670
<v Speaker 2>They get a check his fingernails and watch us steps up to the cage.</v>

5943
02:42:59.671 --> 02:43:01.590
<v Speaker 2>Thinks this is his last fight ever walks in</v>

5944
02:43:03.710 --> 02:43:04.543

02:43:15.940 --> 02:43:19.000
<v Speaker 1>a bit overdoing or drug overdose and they brought them back.</v>

5952
02:43:19.170 --> 02:43:19.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5953
02:43:19.780 --> 02:43:21.220
<v Speaker 1>But it's like for a guy like that,</v>

5954
02:43:21.790 --> 02:43:23.470
<v Speaker 1>that style is just so,</v>

5955
02:43:23.590 --> 02:43:24.610
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard.</v>

5956
02:43:24.670 --> 02:43:25.930
<v Speaker 1>That's such a hard style.</v>

5957
02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:26.681
<v Speaker 1>So crazy.</v>

5958
02:43:26.681 --> 02:43:28.300
<v Speaker 1>That's not like a mighty mouse guy.</v>

5959
02:43:28.301 --> 02:43:29.140
<v Speaker 1>That's not a,</v>

5960
02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:29.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5961
02:43:29.680 --> 02:43:33.040
<v Speaker 1>just a guy who just grind very skillful,</v>

5962
02:43:33.070 --> 02:43:33.910
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about it.</v>

5963
02:43:34.630 --> 02:43:35.361
<v Speaker 1>Great timing.</v>

5964
02:43:35.361 --> 02:43:35.741
<v Speaker 1>Thing was,</v>

5965
02:43:35.741 --> 02:43:36.071
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

5966
02:43:36.071 --> 02:43:37.120
<v Speaker 1>and we tie was ever,</v>

5967
02:43:37.140 --> 02:43:38.470
<v Speaker 1>it's clinch was very good.</v>

5968
02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:39.670
<v Speaker 1>His muay Thai is very good,</v>

5969
02:43:39.671 --> 02:43:41.080
<v Speaker 1>but his Jujitsu is very good dude.</v>

5970
02:43:41.081 --> 02:43:42.880
<v Speaker 1>It's just super underrated.</v>

5971
02:43:43.230 --> 02:43:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Really get hit with that is toughness was world plus she's striking in his</v>

5972
02:43:48.491 --> 02:43:48.821
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

5973
02:43:48.821 --> 02:43:49.180
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't,</v>

5974
02:43:49.180 --> 02:43:51.070
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't say it was world class.</v>

5975
02:43:51.150 --> 02:43:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like fighting.</v>

5976
02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:54.160
<v Speaker 1>That's no disrespect.</v>

5977
02:43:54.161 --> 02:43:54.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>

5978
02:43:54.850 --> 02:43:55.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5979
02:43:55.580 --> 02:43:58.810
<v Speaker 1>his ground game was at like a Verducci is striking.</v>

5980
02:43:58.811 --> 02:43:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Was it like a wonder boy?</v>

5981
02:44:00.060 --> 02:44:01.220
<v Speaker 1>He's good at everything.</v>

5982
02:44:01.430 --> 02:44:04.780
<v Speaker 1>So do you think specialists besides and toughness?</v>

5983
02:44:05.870 --> 02:44:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5984
02:44:06.360 --> 02:44:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm not throwing shade at Brendan.</v>

5985
02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that if you took,</v>

5986
02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:11.620
<v Speaker 1>if fighting</v>

5987
02:44:13.390 --> 02:44:16.690
<v Speaker 1>was as a profitable,</v>

5988
02:44:16.691 --> 02:44:17.530
<v Speaker 1>say as baseball,</v>

5989
02:44:17.531 --> 02:44:17.951
<v Speaker 1>basketball,</v>

5990
02:44:17.951 --> 02:44:18.410
<v Speaker 1>football,</v>

5991
02:44:18.410 --> 02:44:20.200
<v Speaker 1>we'd obviously have very different athletes in the game.</v>

5992
02:44:20.610 --> 02:44:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

5993
02:44:21.220 --> 02:44:23.010
<v Speaker 1>But I just wonder like,</v>

5994
02:44:23.150 --> 02:44:23.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5995
02:44:23.700 --> 02:44:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5996
02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:24.320
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5997
02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if,</v>

5998
02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:26.673
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5999
02:44:27.370 --> 02:44:30.580
<v Speaker 1>if athleticism plays as big a part in the,</v>

6000
02:44:30.820 --> 02:44:34.270
<v Speaker 1>in fighting and it's in the umbrella of fighting as it does in say,</v>

6001
02:44:34.271 --> 02:44:35.170
<v Speaker 1>basketball football.</v>

6002
02:44:35.171 --> 02:44:36.070
<v Speaker 1>So if I,</v>

6003
02:44:36.080 --> 02:44:38.230
<v Speaker 1>you're either making the NFL or the NBA,</v>

6004
02:44:38.910 --> 02:44:39.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6005
02:44:39.820 --> 02:44:41.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot to the game of course.</v>

6006
02:44:41.291 --> 02:44:44.170
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like athletics and plays a bigger factor.</v>

6007
02:44:44.171 --> 02:44:47.970
<v Speaker 1>Like some guys it can be not as athletic and a lot of ways like George Saint</v>

6008
02:44:47.970 --> 02:44:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Pierre still be good and fun.</v>

6009
02:44:48.820 --> 02:44:49.930
<v Speaker 1>It's still fucking,</v>

6010
02:44:49.990 --> 02:44:50.471
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

6011
02:44:50.471 --> 02:44:50.830
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

6012
02:44:50.830 --> 02:44:51.251
<v Speaker 1>What'd you say?</v>

6013
02:44:51.251 --> 02:44:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Not Athletic,</v>

6014
02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:52.710
<v Speaker 1>George.</v>

6015
02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:53.920
<v Speaker 1>George Saint Peter's not that bad.</v>

6016
02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:54.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6017
02:44:54.110 --> 02:44:54.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a great athlete.</v>

6018
02:44:54.971 --> 02:44:56.380
<v Speaker 1>But now the judge is a bad example.</v>

6019
02:44:56.680 --> 02:44:58.420
<v Speaker 1>You want to say a guy like he's a bad example.</v>

6020
02:44:58.421 --> 02:44:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

6021
02:44:58.840 --> 02:44:59.673
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz,</v>

6022
02:44:59.950 --> 02:45:00.783
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz,</v>

6023
02:45:01.630 --> 02:45:02.111
<v Speaker 1>Nick Diaz,</v>

6024
02:45:02.111 --> 02:45:04.390
<v Speaker 1>who was just amazing,</v>

6025
02:45:04.391 --> 02:45:05.860
<v Speaker 1>like it's never been knocked out.</v>

6026
02:45:06.310 --> 02:45:08.020
<v Speaker 1>And Josh Thomson knocked him out.</v>

6027
02:45:08.250 --> 02:45:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6028
02:45:08.680 --> 02:45:09.100
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

6029
02:45:09.100 --> 02:45:10.220
<v Speaker 1>He had kicked him style.</v>

6030
02:45:11.530 --> 02:45:15.190
<v Speaker 1>It was all before the Hoffeld dos Anjos fight.</v>

6031
02:45:15.600 --> 02:45:17.200
<v Speaker 1>He lost the dose on Joel's after that.</v>

6032
02:45:17.201 --> 02:45:19.740
<v Speaker 1>And then after that he's the only one Michael Johnson.</v>

6033
02:45:19.741 --> 02:45:22.480
<v Speaker 1>And then after that he comments the x factor with fighting.</v>

6034
02:45:22.481 --> 02:45:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Where were guys who are not as fast,</v>

6035
02:45:25.571 --> 02:45:27.210
<v Speaker 1>not as strong man is what they can't tell him,</v>

6036
02:45:27.220 --> 02:45:29.170
<v Speaker 1>say not as all that other stuff.</v>

6037
02:45:29.860 --> 02:45:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Somehow are able to close that distance.</v>

6038
02:45:32.681 --> 02:45:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Let me rephrase that.</v>

6039
02:45:33.730 --> 02:45:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Nate got stopped by Josh Thompson.</v>

6040
02:45:35.741 --> 02:45:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Never went unconscious.</v>

6041
02:45:36.610 --> 02:45:39.210
<v Speaker 1>He went to kid rock killed by Nick [inaudible].</v>

6042
02:45:39.250 --> 02:45:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Nick.</v>

6043
02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:40.061
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

6044
02:45:40.061 --> 02:45:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Nick's never been.</v>

6045
02:45:40.820 --> 02:45:41.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6046
02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:41.501
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6047
02:45:41.501 --> 02:45:41.741
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

6048
02:45:41.741 --> 02:45:46.741
<v Speaker 1>Nick got stopped early on in his career by that guy who did tough.</v>

6049
02:45:46.871 --> 02:45:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Who wound up Jeremy?</v>

6050
02:45:48.940 --> 02:45:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Stephens?</v>

6051
02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:50.711
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

6052
02:45:50.711 --> 02:45:51.544
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Jones.</v>

6053
02:45:51.550 --> 02:45:52.383
<v Speaker 1>Is that his name?</v>

6054
02:45:52.420 --> 02:45:55.780
<v Speaker 1>He was a young guy that was really talented and nick and him both fought when</v>

6055
02:45:55.781 --> 02:46:00.130
<v Speaker 1>they were both like 18 or 19 and nick got stopped by him.</v>

6056
02:46:00.160 --> 02:46:00.993
<v Speaker 1>He TK,</v>

6057
02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:03.100
<v Speaker 1>TK,</v>

6058
02:46:03.100 --> 02:46:03.430
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6059
02:46:03.430 --> 02:46:03.641
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

6060
02:46:03.641 --> 02:46:06.430
<v Speaker 1>never loads and he's flat line and he's,</v>

6061
02:46:06.431 --> 02:46:07.870
<v Speaker 1>he's fought the best of the best,</v>

6062
02:46:07.871 --> 02:46:08.231
<v Speaker 1>the best,</v>

6063
02:46:08.231 --> 02:46:09.920
<v Speaker 1>but that guy was super talented.</v>

6064
02:46:09.921 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6065
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:12.140
<v Speaker 2>that guy was super talented but then went to jail,</v>

6066
02:46:12.170 --> 02:46:13.370
<v Speaker 2>went to jail for some shit.</v>

6067
02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:19.240
<v Speaker 2>I think fighting requires a different skillset but when you get a guy who has</v>

6068
02:46:20.481 --> 02:46:22.560
<v Speaker 2>that warrior spirit who's athletic,</v>

6069
02:46:22.561 --> 02:46:23.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

6070
02:46:23.150 --> 02:46:25.070
<v Speaker 2>Then you have problems like the Francis and gun.</v>

6071
02:46:25.071 --> 02:46:28.370
<v Speaker 2>Right or you know or like have it all in mighty mouse,</v>

6072
02:46:28.430 --> 02:46:29.263
<v Speaker 2>Calvin gas,</v>

6073
02:46:29.270 --> 02:46:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Conor McGregor.</v>

6074
02:46:30.060 --> 02:46:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Yet you get these guys who were,</v>

6075
02:46:32.030 --> 02:46:35.480
<v Speaker 2>could probably play other sports like Conor McGregor in there as an athlete in</v>

6076
02:46:35.481 --> 02:46:39.590
<v Speaker 2>terms like God really fuck disability to perform under pressure's undeniable and</v>

6077
02:46:39.591 --> 02:46:41.960
<v Speaker 2>that that is a lot of what I feel that this is a mess.</v>

6078
02:46:42.140 --> 02:46:42.920
<v Speaker 2>It's movements.</v>

6079
02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:43.521
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>

6080
02:46:43.521 --> 02:46:45.900
<v Speaker 2>It was body to lot of what athleticism is,</v>

6081
02:46:45.901 --> 02:46:47.690
<v Speaker 2>is effective use of that body.</v>

6082
02:46:47.691 --> 02:46:51.710
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't deny that a guy who was a world class fighter is also a great</v>

6083
02:46:51.711 --> 02:46:52.340
<v Speaker 2>athlete.</v>

6084
02:46:52.340 --> 02:46:53.960
<v Speaker 2>There's just no room for that anymore.</v>

6085
02:46:54.170 --> 02:46:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Everybody who's at the top of the food chain is a great athlete.</v>

6086
02:46:56.871 --> 02:47:01.040
<v Speaker 2>Obviously Francis is an outlier because he's such an obviously amazing athlete.</v>

6087
02:47:01.050 --> 02:47:02.420
<v Speaker 2>I think Thomas is an outlier to the,</v>

6088
02:47:02.421 --> 02:47:04.910
<v Speaker 2>we can go backwards and reaction time,</v>

6089
02:47:05.100 --> 02:47:07.390
<v Speaker 2>but he's a fucking outlier outline.</v>

6090
02:47:08.660 --> 02:47:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Think about also Woodley's ability to hurt Wonderboy in the two fights that he</v>

6091
02:47:12.891 --> 02:47:15.620
<v Speaker 2>had put Wonderboy and more trouble than he's ever been.</v>

6092
02:47:15.880 --> 02:47:19.070
<v Speaker 2>That we've seen them in sight except for Matt Brown who stopped him cause he</v>

6093
02:47:19.071 --> 02:47:20.840
<v Speaker 2>stopped when we did beat him in a decision.</v>

6094
02:47:20.900 --> 02:47:21.830
<v Speaker 2>I think he'd beat him on decision,</v>

6095
02:47:21.831 --> 02:47:23.570
<v Speaker 2>but beat the shit out of them for three rounds.</v>

6096
02:47:23.571 --> 02:47:27.150
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at a guy like Darren till the Kelp Bagan athletic until ethic.</v>

6097
02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:28.280
<v Speaker 2>He's a big boy.</v>

6098
02:47:28.281 --> 02:47:28.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

6099
02:47:28.910 --> 02:47:29.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6100
02:47:29.091 --> 02:47:31.430
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of guys,</v>

6101
02:47:32.570 --> 02:47:35.410
<v Speaker 2>but there's two different weight classes but I,</v>

6102
02:47:35.690 --> 02:47:36.523
<v Speaker 2>different weight classes,</v>

6103
02:47:36.780 --> 02:47:39.200
<v Speaker 2>but I think he's about 25.</v>

6104
02:47:40.180 --> 02:47:40.670
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

6105
02:47:40.670 --> 02:47:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Luke.</v>

6106
02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Luke can fight it to a five if you want it to.</v>

6107
02:47:42.800 --> 02:47:43.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6108
02:47:43.310 --> 02:47:44.120
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

6109
02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:48.470
<v Speaker 2>I think the day and age you're always going to have those guys in.</v>

6110
02:47:48.471 --> 02:47:49.251
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a knock,</v>

6111
02:47:49.251 --> 02:47:51.410
<v Speaker 2>but those Leonard Garcia is with Matt browns.</v>

6112
02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:52.910
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have those guys.</v>

6113
02:47:52.911 --> 02:47:55.250
<v Speaker 2>But the evolution of the UFC and mixed martial arts,</v>

6114
02:47:55.430 --> 02:47:56.870
<v Speaker 2>those guys are going to slowly fades away.</v>

6115
02:47:56.871 --> 02:47:59.570
<v Speaker 2>You can get better athletes and just being tough.</v>

6116
02:47:59.720 --> 02:48:01.430
<v Speaker 2>Is it going to get you in the top 10 anymore?</v>

6117
02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:02.810
<v Speaker 2>I think you're going to get guys who,</v>

6118
02:48:02.990 --> 02:48:04.100
<v Speaker 2>they have the fighter's mentality,</v>

6119
02:48:04.101 --> 02:48:08.720
<v Speaker 2>but they're the super athletes and that's the evolution of the sport both cause</v>

6120
02:48:08.721 --> 02:48:09.930
<v Speaker 2>you get like a Roy MacDonald,</v>

6121
02:48:10.110 --> 02:48:11.000
<v Speaker 2>really good athlete,</v>

6122
02:48:11.270 --> 02:48:14.690
<v Speaker 2>a fucking monster at everything and he,</v>

6123
02:48:14.691 --> 02:48:14.961
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6124
02:48:14.961 --> 02:48:15.261
<v Speaker 2>he has,</v>

6125
02:48:15.261 --> 02:48:16.130
<v Speaker 2>he can do both.</v>

6126
02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:18.840
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of that Lima fight that's coming up that's not qualified?</v>

6127
02:48:18.870 --> 02:48:19.703
<v Speaker 2>20th Yup.</v>

6128
02:48:19.780 --> 02:48:20.340
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

6129
02:48:20.340 --> 02:48:21.230
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be in Boston.</v>

6130
02:48:21.260 --> 02:48:23.020
<v Speaker 2>That's the same night as the a in Ghana.</v>

6131
02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Fight a fight.</v>

6132
02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:26.900
<v Speaker 2>They're going head to head and head to head.</v>

6133
02:48:26.930 --> 02:48:29.270
<v Speaker 2>I think Shalan rampage is on that to your dvrs.</v>

6134
02:48:29.271 --> 02:48:29.781
<v Speaker 2>Ready folks?</v>

6135
02:48:29.781 --> 02:48:33.330
<v Speaker 2>Can we talk a little bit about home sidebar,</v>

6136
02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:36.620
<v Speaker 2>Battle of the greatest woman fighter of all time?</v>

6137
02:48:36.630 --> 02:48:38.720
<v Speaker 2>I think everyone's up but is,</v>

6138
02:48:38.900 --> 02:48:39.800
<v Speaker 2>but is that the case?</v>

6139
02:48:39.801 --> 02:48:40.041
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

6140
02:48:40.041 --> 02:48:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Because Meesha beats sidebar or Meesha beat Holly never fought Cyborg,</v>

6141
02:48:44.841 --> 02:48:47.960
<v Speaker 2>but the way she beat Holly was so fucking spectacular.</v>

6142
02:48:48.140 --> 02:48:51.080
<v Speaker 2>How do you not always rank Meesha above Holly?</v>

6143
02:48:51.170 --> 02:48:52.040
<v Speaker 2>I know Misha,</v>

6144
02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:56.930
<v Speaker 2>it retired and Holly is still super active and likely should have been 145 pound</v>

6145
02:48:56.931 --> 02:48:57.291
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>

6146
02:48:57.291 --> 02:48:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you take away the deductions,</v>

6147
02:48:59.271 --> 02:48:59.990
<v Speaker 2>right enemy,</v>

6148
02:48:59.990 --> 02:49:02.930
<v Speaker 2>she should have gotten some bullshit for too late shots.</v>

6149
02:49:02.960 --> 02:49:04.400
<v Speaker 2>And then even on top of that,</v>

6150
02:49:04.401 --> 02:49:08.430
<v Speaker 2>you still see like Holly dropped her with a head kick and then dropped him with</v>

6151
02:49:08.431 --> 02:49:09.540
<v Speaker 2>a left hand as well.</v>

6152
02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:13.240
<v Speaker 2>How he was also beating Misha in that fight before she was.</v>

6153
02:49:13.300 --> 02:49:17.250
<v Speaker 2>But those two rounds where she got dominated to here's my one round mounted and</v>

6154
02:49:17.251 --> 02:49:18.180
<v Speaker 2>couldn't do shit about it.</v>

6155
02:49:18.181 --> 02:49:20.340
<v Speaker 2>And then the last 15 seconds is a fine.</v>

6156
02:49:20.700 --> 02:49:21.990
<v Speaker 2>Misha pulls out the ultimate,</v>

6157
02:49:21.991 --> 02:49:22.530
<v Speaker 2>takes her down,</v>

6158
02:49:22.530 --> 02:49:25.320
<v Speaker 2>takes her back and it chokes her to sleep for the best for sure.</v>

6159
02:49:25.321 --> 02:49:26.670
<v Speaker 2>But if we're going to play that game,</v>

6160
02:49:26.671 --> 02:49:27.960
<v Speaker 2>then Holly,</v>

6161
02:49:28.740 --> 02:49:29.491
<v Speaker 2>Merck,</v>

6162
02:49:29.491 --> 02:49:31.680
<v Speaker 2>the girl who Meesha could never even hold a candle.</v>

6163
02:49:31.970 --> 02:49:32.803
<v Speaker 2>Ronda Rousey.</v>

6164
02:49:32.820 --> 02:49:33.211
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

6165
02:49:33.211 --> 02:49:36.030
<v Speaker 2>But don't you think that Misha kept getting better and that the Meesha who</v>

6166
02:49:36.031 --> 02:49:36.810
<v Speaker 2>fought,</v>

6167
02:49:36.810 --> 02:49:41.810
<v Speaker 2>I think the Meesha that fought against Holly Holm was very much an improved</v>

6168
02:49:42.571 --> 02:49:44.380
<v Speaker 2>version of the Meesha that fought against Rhonda.</v>

6169
02:49:45.180 --> 02:49:46.350
<v Speaker 2>But that me shut,</v>

6170
02:49:46.380 --> 02:49:46.651
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6171
02:49:46.651 --> 02:49:46.950
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

6172
02:49:46.950 --> 02:49:49.080
<v Speaker 2>her whole thing is grappling.</v>

6173
02:49:49.530 --> 02:49:49.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6174
02:49:49.820 --> 02:49:53.370
<v Speaker 2>So it try implementing that game plan that gets Rhonda grappling.</v>

6175
02:49:53.371 --> 02:49:54.204
<v Speaker 2>Enjoy that.</v>

6176
02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:57.410
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] stand up as one of the reasons why she was good.</v>

6177
02:49:57.640 --> 02:49:59.800
<v Speaker 2>She got better than she did in the early Rhonda.</v>

6178
02:49:59.860 --> 02:50:00.420
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda.</v>

6179
02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:01.620
<v Speaker 2>She did so did Rhonda.</v>

6180
02:50:01.740 --> 02:50:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6181
02:50:02.460 --> 02:50:03.000
<v Speaker 2>she might.</v>

6182
02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:03.833
<v Speaker 2>She might take step back.</v>

6183
02:50:04.170 --> 02:50:06.150
<v Speaker 2>But here's my problem event.</v>

6184
02:50:06.180 --> 02:50:07.410
<v Speaker 2>You got to look at Amanda Nunez,</v>

6185
02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:08.071
<v Speaker 2>Amanda Nunez,</v>

6186
02:50:08.071 --> 02:50:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Pete the shit out of the both of them.</v>

6187
02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:11.640
<v Speaker 2>And the way she did it was like,</v>

6188
02:50:11.670 --> 02:50:12.503
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6189
02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:13.500
<v Speaker 2>points her cry.</v>

6190
02:50:13.620 --> 02:50:16.770
<v Speaker 2>The way she throws like those warm of Bang Bang on.</v>

6191
02:50:17.010 --> 02:50:17.670
<v Speaker 2>She's yes,</v>

6192
02:50:17.670 --> 02:50:18.900
<v Speaker 2>she's a mandating as is.</v>

6193
02:50:18.901 --> 02:50:19.734
<v Speaker 2>Yikes.</v>

6194
02:50:20.160 --> 02:50:20.491
<v Speaker 2>Yikes.</v>

6195
02:50:20.491 --> 02:50:21.900
<v Speaker 2>And I wish you got more promotional.</v>

6196
02:50:21.901 --> 02:50:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Push just hammers at.</v>

6197
02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:24.470
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

6198
02:50:24.470 --> 02:50:25.231
<v Speaker 2>if Holly Holm,</v>

6199
02:50:25.231 --> 02:50:26.790
<v Speaker 2>we're able to pull off this upset.</v>

6200
02:50:26.970 --> 02:50:28.080
<v Speaker 2>She's number one for me.</v>

6201
02:50:28.320 --> 02:50:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Beating Ronda and her prime beaten Cyborg in a private Cyborg is fucking scary,</v>

6202
02:50:33.511 --> 02:50:33.840
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

6203
02:50:33.840 --> 02:50:34.673
<v Speaker 2>She be lies.</v>

6204
02:50:34.890 --> 02:50:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Cyborg is always be lined.</v>

6205
02:50:36.031 --> 02:50:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Everybody,</v>

6206
02:50:36.570 --> 02:50:39.870
<v Speaker 2>she just comes straight in and puts so much pressure on you.</v>

6207
02:50:40.360 --> 02:50:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Last fight,</v>

6208
02:50:40.910 --> 02:50:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Tanya,</v>

6209
02:50:41.310 --> 02:50:42.210
<v Speaker 2>if she went,</v>

6210
02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:42.850
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

6211
02:50:42.850 --> 02:50:44.760
<v Speaker 2>here's my [inaudible] just going to murder this girl.</v>

6212
02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:46.350
<v Speaker 2>Watch them stick behind the Jab.</v>

6213
02:50:46.390 --> 02:50:47.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna figure some things out.</v>

6214
02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:51.360
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't show Holly has a way better chance because if she does that with</v>

6215
02:50:51.361 --> 02:50:53.580
<v Speaker 2>Holly where she says I'm,</v>

6216
02:50:53.581 --> 02:50:54.750
<v Speaker 2>cause I think she's got,</v>

6217
02:50:54.840 --> 02:50:55.200
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

6218
02:50:55.200 --> 02:50:56.011
<v Speaker 2>she's been training.</v>

6219
02:50:56.011 --> 02:50:58.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think it's almost like she's been training with somebody different.</v>

6220
02:50:58.730 --> 02:50:59.670
<v Speaker 2>So take your time.</v>

6221
02:50:59.970 --> 02:51:00.803
<v Speaker 2>Step back.</v>

6222
02:51:01.010 --> 02:51:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Best Bucklin coaching.</v>

6223
02:51:02.220 --> 02:51:02.821
<v Speaker 2>That's actually,</v>

6224
02:51:02.821 --> 02:51:05.010
<v Speaker 2>that actually favors Holly I think.</v>

6225
02:51:05.220 --> 02:51:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Then her old style,</v>

6226
02:51:06.541 --> 02:51:11.541
<v Speaker 2>which is to come in close Batali that if she booked comes at Holly lights'll</v>

6227
02:51:12.030 --> 02:51:13.050
<v Speaker 2>like Rhonda did.</v>

6228
02:51:13.051 --> 02:51:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6229
02:51:13.260 --> 02:51:14.430
<v Speaker 2>he kicked in the face.</v>

6230
02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:15.011
<v Speaker 2>That's different.</v>

6231
02:51:15.011 --> 02:51:17.800
<v Speaker 2>There was no with with Cyborg is she?</v>

6232
02:51:17.880 --> 02:51:18.780
<v Speaker 2>She's so strong.</v>

6233
02:51:18.781 --> 02:51:19.080
<v Speaker 2>She's,</v>

6234
02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:19.440

<v Speaker 2>covers off.</v>

6236
02:51:19.980 --> 02:51:20.610
<v Speaker 2>She's calculate.</v>

6237
02:51:20.610 --> 02:51:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Here's the other x factor.</v>

6238
02:51:22.050 --> 02:51:23.130
<v Speaker 2>If cyber goes,</v>

6239
02:51:23.280 --> 02:51:23.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6240
02:51:23.880 --> 02:51:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Holly kind of sucks on the ground.</v>

6241
02:51:25.830 --> 02:51:27.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm a black belt on the ground.</v>

6242
02:51:27.090 --> 02:51:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I also can grapple like a motherfucker.</v>

6243
02:51:29.130 --> 02:51:30.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just going to stand and stretch.</v>

6244
02:51:30.610 --> 02:51:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Give you,</v>

6245
02:51:30.780 --> 02:51:31.441
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take you there.</v>

6246
02:51:31.441 --> 02:51:32.820
<v Speaker 2>And she's a naturally larger woman.</v>

6247
02:51:32.850 --> 02:51:33.541
<v Speaker 2>She's way bigger.</v>

6248
02:51:33.541 --> 02:51:37.170
<v Speaker 2>So she gets against the get paid an hour tees issues been trying on pick Tito</v>

6249
02:51:37.170 --> 02:51:37.350
<v Speaker 2>Ortiz up.</v>

6250
02:51:37.350 --> 02:51:37.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6251
02:51:37.621 --> 02:51:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Is She black now?</v>

6252
02:51:38.940 --> 02:51:39.773
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

6253
02:51:39.880 --> 02:51:40.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6254
02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:42.090
<v Speaker 2>and she's competed as a brown belt.</v>

6255
02:51:42.091 --> 02:51:46.020
<v Speaker 2>I know she did very well and some high level competition.</v>

6256
02:51:46.350 --> 02:51:47.910
<v Speaker 2>She's a big woman.</v>

6257
02:51:48.390 --> 02:51:49.320
<v Speaker 2>Her and Debbie Garcia.</v>

6258
02:51:49.321 --> 02:51:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Go add it.</v>

6259
02:51:50.080 --> 02:51:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Grappling.</v>

6260
02:51:50.820 --> 02:51:51.121
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6261
02:51:51.121 --> 02:51:51.890
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

6262
02:51:51.890 --> 02:51:52.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6263
02:51:52.310 --> 02:51:53.770
<v Speaker 2>and if she decides any partner,</v>

6264
02:51:53.800 --> 02:51:56.100
<v Speaker 2>she decides to go on me should tape footage.</v>

6265
02:51:56.101 --> 02:51:56.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6266
02:51:56.550 --> 02:51:59.790
<v Speaker 2>And see how easy Nisha Choke Talia Cardone.</v>

6267
02:52:00.540 --> 02:52:01.980
<v Speaker 2>That's in her back pocket and she goes,</v>

6268
02:52:02.190 --> 02:52:02.580
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

6269
02:52:02.580 --> 02:52:03.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm the feet.</v>

6270
02:52:03.150 --> 02:52:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Let's get a little tricky.</v>

6271
02:52:04.230 --> 02:52:05.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to grapple shirt.</v>

6272
02:52:05.431 --> 02:52:07.240
<v Speaker 2>She has a hard time making 45 right?</v>

6273
02:52:07.540 --> 02:52:07.811
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

6274
02:52:07.811 --> 02:52:08.380
<v Speaker 2>she does.</v>

6275
02:52:08.380 --> 02:52:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6276
02:52:08.620 --> 02:52:12.010
<v Speaker 2>She would be better off if there's a 155 pound woman's weight class.</v>

6277
02:52:12.060 --> 02:52:13.360
<v Speaker 2>She didn't have to cut so much weight.</v>

6278
02:52:14.020 --> 02:52:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6279
02:52:14.380 --> 02:52:15.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's leaned out.</v>

6280
02:52:15.461 --> 02:52:18.400
<v Speaker 2>She looks leaner now that she did when she was fighting in Strikeforce.</v>

6281
02:52:18.401 --> 02:52:18.581
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6282
02:52:18.581 --> 02:52:20.230
<v Speaker 2>I think when she fought like Gina Carano,</v>

6283
02:52:20.231 --> 02:52:21.940
<v Speaker 2>she was fucking gigantic.</v>

6284
02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:23.410
<v Speaker 2>She's much smaller now.</v>

6285
02:52:23.440 --> 02:52:24.580
<v Speaker 2>It's such a good fight though.</v>

6286
02:52:24.581 --> 02:52:25.414
<v Speaker 2>But she's still,</v>

6287
02:52:25.810 --> 02:52:27.660
<v Speaker 2>she's still a destroyer.</v>

6288
02:52:27.680 --> 02:52:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6289
02:52:28.090 --> 02:52:28.481
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6290
02:52:28.481 --> 02:52:29.314
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

6291
02:52:29.710 --> 02:52:34.710
<v Speaker 2>I think for a lot of fighters I feel like she's finally got to it where she,</v>

6292
02:52:35.201 --> 02:52:36.370
<v Speaker 2>she deserves this.</v>

6293
02:52:36.730 --> 02:52:39.790
<v Speaker 2>But she definitely deserves this big high profile fight.</v>

6294
02:52:39.791 --> 02:52:40.810
<v Speaker 2>But so does Holly,</v>

6295
02:52:41.080 --> 02:52:41.261
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6296
02:52:41.261 --> 02:52:41.981
<v Speaker 2>they both do.</v>

6297
02:52:41.981 --> 02:52:46.480
<v Speaker 2>This is a really interesting fight because like clearly Holly's dangerous,</v>

6298
02:52:46.510 --> 02:52:46.781
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

6299
02:52:46.781 --> 02:52:47.531
<v Speaker 2>She head kicks,</v>

6300
02:52:47.531 --> 02:52:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Rhonda knocks her out,</v>

6301
02:52:48.761 --> 02:52:51.040
<v Speaker 2>she head kicks Batchko hey on knocked her out.</v>

6302
02:52:51.190 --> 02:52:53.140
<v Speaker 2>She had kicked Germane to random,</v>

6303
02:52:53.141 --> 02:52:58.141
<v Speaker 2>he was a multiple time world Moitai champion head kicks her drops her and a lot</v>

6304
02:52:58.901 --> 02:53:00.430
<v Speaker 2>of people thought she should have got that decision.</v>

6305
02:53:00.430 --> 02:53:03.430
<v Speaker 2>At the very least it was super fucking close and Jermaine's one of the best</v>

6306
02:53:03.431 --> 02:53:04.300
<v Speaker 2>strikers in the world.</v>

6307
02:53:04.510 --> 02:53:05.130
<v Speaker 2>She's a,</v>

6308
02:53:05.130 --> 02:53:06.670
<v Speaker 2>she's a nasty strikes.</v>

6309
02:53:06.671 --> 02:53:11.671
<v Speaker 2>So then if Holly and Cyborg just strike who gets the edge?</v>

6310
02:53:11.770 --> 02:53:12.450
<v Speaker 2>Well it see that.</v>

6311
02:53:12.450 --> 02:53:13.001
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>

6312
02:53:13.001 --> 02:53:14.860
<v Speaker 2>like you can't sleep on Holly,</v>

6313
02:53:14.861 --> 02:53:19.150
<v Speaker 2>like she's probably got a disadvantage when it comes to punching power.</v>

6314
02:53:19.151 --> 02:53:22.960
<v Speaker 2>And probably a significant mean we won't,</v>

6315
02:53:22.961 --> 02:53:23.411
<v Speaker 2>we really know.</v>

6316
02:53:23.411 --> 02:53:26.710
<v Speaker 2>Cause Holly has dropped people and she does have sharp punches and she's an 18</v>

6317
02:53:26.711 --> 02:53:28.390
<v Speaker 2>time world women's boxing champion.</v>

6318
02:53:28.391 --> 02:53:28.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean she's,</v>

6319
02:53:28.960 --> 02:53:32.320
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of craziness to what Holly was able to do as a,</v>

6320
02:53:32.321 --> 02:53:33.550
<v Speaker 2>as a striker with her hands.</v>

6321
02:53:33.551 --> 02:53:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Holly's more decorated.</v>

6322
02:53:34.931 --> 02:53:37.390
<v Speaker 2>It's our street striking cyber hits.</v>

6323
02:53:37.630 --> 02:53:41.500
<v Speaker 2>She hits so fucking hard and she's so aggressive.</v>

6324
02:53:41.501 --> 02:53:41.771
<v Speaker 2>Did you,</v>

6325
02:53:41.771 --> 02:53:43.330
<v Speaker 2>did you see a Cyborg,</v>

6326
02:53:43.390 --> 02:53:43.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6327
02:53:43.810 --> 02:53:47.770
<v Speaker 2>going against the gold medalist in the female box on the ward?</v>

6328
02:53:47.770 --> 02:53:49.270
<v Speaker 2>I think Clarissa shields that is,</v>

6329
02:53:49.750 --> 02:53:50.380
<v Speaker 2>that is her name.</v>

6330
02:53:50.380 --> 02:53:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6331
02:53:50.740 --> 02:53:51.311
<v Speaker 2>Did you see him?</v>

6332
02:53:51.311 --> 02:53:52.270
<v Speaker 2>You send me that footage.</v>

6333
02:53:52.330 --> 02:53:54.930
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing you sit that Manet.</v>

6334
02:53:55.050 --> 02:53:55.883
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6335
02:53:56.200 --> 02:53:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Claressa shields is no joke.</v>

6336
02:53:57.760 --> 02:53:57.881
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6337
02:53:57.881 --> 02:54:00.140
<v Speaker 2>she's up Beth buses.</v>

6338
02:54:00.290 --> 02:54:01.031
<v Speaker 2>You bring that up.</v>

6339
02:54:01.031 --> 02:54:01.864
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

6340
02:54:02.140 --> 02:54:02.890
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

6341
02:54:02.890 --> 02:54:04.570
<v Speaker 2>It's fun to watch too because you realize,</v>

6342
02:54:04.571 --> 02:54:04.811
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

6343
02:54:04.811 --> 02:54:06.160
<v Speaker 2>well she can hang in the pocket.</v>

6344
02:54:06.161 --> 02:54:07.390
<v Speaker 2>She takes a tremendous shot.</v>

6345
02:54:07.690 --> 02:54:09.520
<v Speaker 2>If you really want to be impressed by Cyborg,</v>

6346
02:54:09.550 --> 02:54:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I say you look at her one Moitai loss to Juliana.</v>

6347
02:54:13.640 --> 02:54:15.730
<v Speaker 2>I didn't cars.</v>

6348
02:54:15.820 --> 02:54:16.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6349
02:54:16.210 --> 02:54:17.590
<v Speaker 2>she's in Bellator kickboxing now.</v>

6350
02:54:17.620 --> 02:54:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Zarina Bart is a monster.</v>

6351
02:54:20.080 --> 02:54:25.080
<v Speaker 2>She's this really tall woman from Holland who's got outstanding technique and</v>

6352
02:54:25.211 --> 02:54:26.044
<v Speaker 2>she was haunted.</v>

6353
02:54:26.140 --> 02:54:27.130
<v Speaker 2>Nobody was fucking with her.</v>

6354
02:54:27.131 --> 02:54:28.630
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't get a fight for years.</v>

6355
02:54:29.050 --> 02:54:31.300
<v Speaker 2>So she's given her some coaching here.</v>

6356
02:54:31.500 --> 02:54:31.910
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

6357
02:54:31.910 --> 02:54:36.010
<v Speaker 2>so cyborg decided to fight that Moy Tai Monster and it went to a decision.</v>

6358
02:54:36.330 --> 02:54:37.690
<v Speaker 2>Cyborg landed some good shots.</v>

6359
02:54:37.930 --> 02:54:38.231
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6360
02:54:38.231 --> 02:54:39.890
<v Speaker 2>Not only did it go to a decision to,</v>

6361
02:54:39.920 --> 02:54:41.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm working on a new tattoos on her legs.</v>

6362
02:54:41.560 --> 02:54:41.891
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6363
02:54:41.891 --> 02:54:42.640
<v Speaker 2>that's tape.</v>

6364
02:54:42.640 --> 02:54:43.540
<v Speaker 2>That's like uh,</v>

6365
02:54:43.790 --> 02:54:44.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6367
02:54:46.870 --> 02:54:47.321
<v Speaker 2>How weird.</v>

6368
02:54:47.321 --> 02:54:48.170
<v Speaker 2>It's all criss crossing.</v>

6369
02:54:48.171 --> 02:54:49.004
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6370
02:54:49.030 --> 02:54:49.721
<v Speaker 2>it's a shitty video.</v>

6371
02:54:49.721 --> 02:54:50.340
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

6372
02:54:50.340 --> 02:54:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6373
02:54:50.990 --> 02:54:51.761
<v Speaker 2>it's awful video.</v>

6374
02:54:51.761 --> 02:54:54.610
<v Speaker 2>But you cyborg got dropped a bunch of times,</v>

6375
02:54:54.611 --> 02:54:55.900
<v Speaker 2>kept getting up,</v>

6376
02:54:56.170 --> 02:54:56.411
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6377
02:54:56.411 --> 02:55:00.850
<v Speaker 2>came after her and was there for the fucking final bells to swing and trying to</v>

6378
02:55:00.851 --> 02:55:01.351
<v Speaker 2>take her out.</v>

6379
02:55:01.351 --> 02:55:03.040
<v Speaker 2>Thai girl had had her hands full,</v>

6380
02:55:03.130 --> 02:55:04.040
<v Speaker 2>going to walk in the park.</v>

6381
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:06.170
<v Speaker 2>It was not a walk in the pauses specialist.</v>

6382
02:55:06.410 --> 02:55:08.580
<v Speaker 2>And she's so good during the bar.</v>

6383
02:55:08.940 --> 02:55:09.561
<v Speaker 2>Watch her fight.</v>

6384
02:55:09.561 --> 02:55:10.400
<v Speaker 2>She's so good.</v>

6385
02:55:11.270 --> 02:55:14.480
<v Speaker 2>So here's a cyborg sparring with look how good this girl is,</v>

6386
02:55:15.500 --> 02:55:15.861
<v Speaker 2>but look,</v>

6387
02:55:15.861 --> 02:55:18.890
<v Speaker 2>sideboard and that she's hanging in there.</v>

6388
02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:19.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6389
02:55:19.371 --> 02:55:22.280
<v Speaker 2>She goes to the head of the doing work though.</v>

6390
02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:23.000
<v Speaker 2>She is,</v>

6391
02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:24.140
<v Speaker 2>she's so good man.</v>

6392
02:55:24.200 --> 02:55:24.541
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

6393
02:55:24.541 --> 02:55:25.730
<v Speaker 2>these girls are going at it.</v>

6394
02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:28.250
<v Speaker 2>This is not like a light sparring session.</v>

6395
02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:29.510
<v Speaker 2>This is almost like a fight,</v>

6396
02:55:30.020 --> 02:55:30.321
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

6397
02:55:30.321 --> 02:55:33.890
<v Speaker 2>And she's got to be careful because Cyborg has big fucking power.</v>

6398
02:55:34.010 --> 02:55:36.680
<v Speaker 2>So she's treating this like this is a dangerous fight for her.</v>

6399
02:55:36.710 --> 02:55:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

6400
02:55:37.190 --> 02:55:38.300
<v Speaker 2>she's landing these shots,</v>

6401
02:55:38.301 --> 02:55:40.880
<v Speaker 2>but she's realizing like that stuff that's coming her way,</v>

6402
02:55:41.030 --> 02:55:42.890
<v Speaker 2>she can't take one of those on the point of the chin.</v>

6403
02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:43.250
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

6404
02:55:43.250 --> 02:55:44.300
<v Speaker 2>she's getting tagged.</v>

6405
02:55:44.570 --> 02:55:46.640
<v Speaker 2>Look at this sidewalk tagged a couple times,</v>

6406
02:55:46.940 --> 02:55:50.210
<v Speaker 2>but she's clearly like the more polished professional boxer.</v>

6407
02:55:50.260 --> 02:55:51.011
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Cyborg.</v>

6408
02:55:51.011 --> 02:55:51.801
<v Speaker 2>It's doing work.</v>

6409
02:55:51.801 --> 02:55:52.061
<v Speaker 2>Does she?</v>

6410
02:55:52.061 --> 02:55:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Is she is doing,</v>

6411
02:55:52.830 --> 02:55:54.890
<v Speaker 2>you're not like a left hook to the body.</v>

6412
02:55:54.891 --> 02:55:55.030
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

6413
02:55:55.030 --> 02:55:55.371
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

6414
02:55:55.371 --> 02:55:56.870
<v Speaker 2>that's step in left hook to the body.</v>

6415
02:55:57.580 --> 02:55:58.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh that's pretty,</v>

6416
02:55:59.540 --> 02:56:00.373
<v Speaker 2>she's so good.</v>

6417
02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:05.440
<v Speaker 2>It's so important for a girl like her to get that kind of sparring it into hell.</v>

6418
02:56:05.510 --> 02:56:05.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6419
02:56:05.900 --> 02:56:07.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean who the fuck wants to spar with Cyborg?</v>

6420
02:56:07.890 --> 02:56:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh one came about cyber stalking about Nolan would spar with her.</v>

6421
02:56:11.300 --> 02:56:11.980
<v Speaker 2>So this girl was like,</v>

6422
02:56:11.980 --> 02:56:12.650
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it.</v>

6423
02:56:12.650 --> 02:56:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6424
02:56:13.340 --> 02:56:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Let her kick Ya.</v>

6425
02:56:14.060 --> 02:56:16.160
<v Speaker 2>I gotta say that I got arrested.</v>

6426
02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:19.640
<v Speaker 2>That muy Thai fight with that was it close?</v>

6427
02:56:19.850 --> 02:56:20.241
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

6428
02:56:20.241 --> 02:56:22.550
<v Speaker 2>it was a clear unanimous decision,</v>

6429
02:56:22.551 --> 02:56:24.080
<v Speaker 2>but it was dangerous at every turn.</v>

6430
02:56:24.110 --> 02:56:24.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6431
02:56:24.620 --> 02:56:25.740
<v Speaker 2>And also that woman doesn't,</v>

6432
02:56:25.741 --> 02:56:26.550
<v Speaker 2>that's her thing.</v>

6433
02:56:26.550 --> 02:56:27.770
<v Speaker 2>Have more respect for cyber.</v>

6434
02:56:27.771 --> 02:56:28.604
<v Speaker 2>You have to watch it.</v>

6435
02:56:28.690 --> 02:56:30.230
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't gonna win,</v>

6436
02:56:30.231 --> 02:56:31.400
<v Speaker 2>but she fucking did work.</v>

6437
02:56:31.490 --> 02:56:33.500
<v Speaker 2>She got head kicked with a stomp.</v>

6438
02:56:33.530 --> 02:56:37.280
<v Speaker 2>She got like front push kick to the face like right on the chin or the next snap</v>

6439
02:56:37.281 --> 02:56:37.671
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

6440
02:56:37.671 --> 02:56:38.504
<v Speaker 2>She falls down,</v>

6441
02:56:38.660 --> 02:56:42.710
<v Speaker 2>she gets up and you still chasing after she's a warrior man.</v>

6442
02:56:42.711 --> 02:56:44.250
<v Speaker 2>She's a fucking warrior.</v>

6443
02:56:44.690 --> 02:56:45.530
<v Speaker 2>But so's Holly.</v>

6444
02:56:45.680 --> 02:56:48.510
<v Speaker 2>Holly just comes off like cleaner and like,</v>

6445
02:56:48.860 --> 02:56:49.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6446
02:56:49.131 --> 02:56:53.240
<v Speaker 2>she comes off like more polished and she's very pretty and it's very,</v>

6447
02:56:53.241 --> 02:56:57.290
<v Speaker 2>she's very calm and very kind and nice to hear her talk.</v>

6448
02:56:57.320 --> 02:56:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I think we're a female.</v>

6449
02:56:58.161 --> 02:56:58.941
<v Speaker 2>Fighting's add that,</v>

02:56:59.240 --> 02:57:02.780

6452
02:57:02.781 --> 02:57:03.350
<v Speaker 2>all time.</v>

6453
02:57:03.350 --> 02:57:05.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the forefront of the feminist movement.</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6513
02:58:21.421 --> 02:58:22.950
<v Speaker 1>It's important to figure out what,</v>

6514
02:58:23.130 --> 02:58:24.870
<v Speaker 1>what style you need to beat Cyborg.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like Tanya have injured,</v>

6516

6517
02:58:29.941 --> 02:58:33.150
<v Speaker 1>But it was like one of those things where Cyborg just keeps advancing and in</v>

6518
02:58:33.151 --> 02:58:33.984
<v Speaker 1>every exchange,</v>

6519
02:58:34.040 --> 02:58:36.120
<v Speaker 1>every time she's so much more firepower.</v>

6520
02:58:36.150 --> 02:58:37.100
<v Speaker 1>But Evan jurists,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6525
02:58:39.800 --> 02:58:40.770
<v Speaker 1>She was trying to win that fight.</v>

6526
02:58:40.800 --> 02:58:44.460
<v Speaker 1>This is a different fight cause Holly is very dangerous and she has a weird</v>

6527
02:58:44.461 --> 02:58:45.120
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

6528
02:58:45.120 --> 02:58:46.590
<v Speaker 1>She'll fight karate style.</v>

6529
02:58:46.710 --> 02:58:48.000
<v Speaker 1>She throws sidekicks,</v>

6530

<v Speaker 1>a lot of front leg sidekicks.</v>

6531
02:58:49.490 --> 02:58:50.430
<v Speaker 1>She throws those,</v>

6532
02:58:50.490 --> 02:58:52.410
<v Speaker 1>those oblique kicks to the inner thigh.</v>

6533
02:58:52.710 --> 02:58:53.880
<v Speaker 1>And here's the thing,</v>

6534
02:58:54.120 --> 02:58:56.990
<v Speaker 1>Holly might be going to go to the bathroom,</v>

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:57.781

<v Speaker 1>but what I want to do is,</v>

6603
03:00:16.360 --> 03:00:16.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6604
03:00:16.740 --> 03:00:17.400

6605
03:00:17.400 --> 03:00:18.930
<v Speaker 1>But you're only doing archery,</v>

6606
03:00:18.931 --> 03:00:19.171
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6607

03:00:23.070 --> 03:00:23.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6612
03:00:24.050 --> 03:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>That's a boy.</v>

6613
03:00:25.590 --> 03:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard one.</v>

6614
03:00:26.460 --> 03:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird learn on the job.</v>

6615
03:00:27.601 --> 03:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>One shooting arrows at animals.</v>

6616
03:00:29.281 --> 03:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be completely obsessed with doing that.</v>

6617
03:00:31.500 --> 03:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6618
03:00:31.950 --> 03:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>You've got a um,</v>

6619
03:00:33.240 --> 03:00:34.073
<v Speaker 1>or not,</v>

6620
03:00:34.080 --> 03:00:34.913
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6621
03:00:34.980 --> 03:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

6622
03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:38.040
<v Speaker 1>the reality is rifle is more,</v>

6623
03:00:38.520 --> 03:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>it's more affective.</v>

6624
03:00:40.650 --> 03:00:41.011
<v Speaker 1>Like you,</v>

6625
03:00:41.011 --> 03:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>we'll shoot more things with a rifle.</v>

6626
03:00:42.811 --> 03:00:44.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to get as close.</v>

6627
03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:47.350
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to move while you're shooting a rifle and you bring up yeah.</v>

6628
03:00:47.730 --> 03:00:48.181
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

6629
03:00:48.181 --> 03:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6630
03:00:48.570 --> 03:00:48.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6631
03:00:48.781 --> 03:00:50.730
<v Speaker 1>If you're in an area that allows both things.</v>

6632
03:00:50.770 --> 03:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6633
03:00:51.090 --> 03:00:52.050
<v Speaker 1>It depends on where you're going.</v>

6634
03:00:52.070 --> 03:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Cause I know I have to get an elk.</v>

6635
03:00:53.550 --> 03:00:53.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6636
03:00:53.911 --> 03:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Seeing what else they have specific seasons or you're allowed to.</v>

6637
03:00:57.421 --> 03:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6638
03:00:58.080 --> 03:01:02.380
<v Speaker 1>most of the time during the Rut you have to use archery equipment in most</v>

6639
03:01:02.381 --> 03:01:03.214
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

6640
03:01:03.580 --> 03:01:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Some places have different,</v>

6641
03:01:04.541 --> 03:01:05.374
<v Speaker 1>there's like some,</v>

6642
03:01:05.770 --> 03:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>some different,</v>

6643
03:01:06.480 --> 03:01:08.320
<v Speaker 1>let you use all weapons and some,</v>

6644
03:01:08.321 --> 03:01:10.000
<v Speaker 1>they have some special tags,</v>

6645
03:01:10.420 --> 03:01:11.500
<v Speaker 1>but like during the rot,</v>

6646
03:01:11.501 --> 03:01:12.400
<v Speaker 1>when they're breeding,</v>

6647
03:01:12.730 --> 03:01:14.800
<v Speaker 1>the idea is that it's easy to find them.</v>

6648
03:01:14.801 --> 03:01:15.220
<v Speaker 1>They're all,</v>

6649
03:01:15.220 --> 03:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>they're all howling and making those Elk Lake Wales and they're distracted by</v>

6650
03:01:20.441 --> 03:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>pussy and to get close enough to shoot him with a bow and Arrow way more</v>

6651
03:01:24.971 --> 03:01:27.790
<v Speaker 1>difficult cause you could just purchase yourself on a fucking,</v>

6652
03:01:28.270 --> 03:01:28.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6653
03:01:28.691 --> 03:01:32.350
<v Speaker 1>a nice tree stump and let that site just settle perfectly on it.</v>

6654
03:01:32.380 --> 03:01:33.340
<v Speaker 1>If you have a rifle and just,</v>

6655
03:01:33.341 --> 03:01:34.690
<v Speaker 1>but boom and they're dead,</v>

6656
03:01:34.780 --> 03:01:35.260
<v Speaker 1>they're dead.</v>

6657
03:01:35.260 --> 03:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you pull the trigger or as a bow and Arrow,</v>

6658
03:01:37.780 --> 03:01:40.900
<v Speaker 1>you really should be getting inside of 40 yards if you can.</v>

6659
03:01:40.901 --> 03:01:41.291
<v Speaker 1>Hard.</v>

6660
03:01:41.291 --> 03:01:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6661
03:01:41.680 --> 03:01:42.491
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard.</v>

6662
03:01:42.491 --> 03:01:42.851
<v Speaker 1>Smell.</v>

6665
03:01:45.491 --> 03:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>They're constantly tuned in and turned on and you have to fight off the fact</v>

6666
03:01:48.791 --> 03:01:51.160
<v Speaker 1>that there's like if a bull elk,</v>

6668
03:01:52.001 --> 03:01:54.550
<v Speaker 1>you might have 30 cows that are around that bull elk.</v>

6669
03:01:54.580 --> 03:01:56.080
<v Speaker 1>You gotta trick them to.</v>

6670

6691
03:02:17.560 --> 03:02:17.801
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

6692
03:02:17.801 --> 03:02:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I looked in the math that you don't,</v>

6693
03:02:19.031 --> 03:02:20.320
<v Speaker 1>you look like shit man.</v>

6694
03:02:20.440 --> 03:02:21.880
<v Speaker 1>How much caffeine did you drink?</v>

6695
03:02:22.150 --> 03:02:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6696
03:02:22.690 --> 03:02:23.381
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

6697
03:02:23.381 --> 03:02:24.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6698
03:02:24.190 --> 03:02:26.620
<v Speaker 1>a latte with an extra shot on the way here,</v>

6699
03:02:26.800 --> 03:02:28.270
<v Speaker 1>that three cups this morning.</v>

6700
03:02:28.480 --> 03:02:31.220
<v Speaker 1>But then I drank this thing who never stopped drinking.</v>

6701
03:02:31.221 --> 03:02:33.220
<v Speaker 1>He drank the caveman and then you drank that.</v>

6702
03:02:33.221 --> 03:02:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Other than that I can't get the French press and I haven't eaten today cause I</v>

6703
03:02:36.311 --> 03:02:37.360
<v Speaker 1>fast in the morning.</v>

6704
03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:39.370
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of caffeine.</v>

6705
03:02:39.750 --> 03:02:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Does you go crazy for Christmas?</v>

6706
03:02:42.580 --> 03:02:43.413
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

03:02:43.510 --> 03:02:44.000
<v Speaker 1>no I didn't.</v>

6708
03:02:44.000 --> 03:02:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't cheat on Christmas.</v>

6709
03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:46.833
<v Speaker 1>What are you saying?</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's got a weight issue.</v>

6712
03:02:49.320 --> 03:02:49.540
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

6713

<v Speaker 1>no I don't.</v>

6716
03:02:52.740 --> 03:02:53.561
<v Speaker 1>I've been super strict.</v>

6717
03:02:53.561 --> 03:02:54.970
<v Speaker 1>I haven't cheated since a thanksgiving.</v>

6718
03:02:54.980 --> 03:02:55.511
<v Speaker 1>Secretly.</v>

6719
03:02:55.511 --> 03:02:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we'll go crazy on not when I'm striking like this Quito kid is back</v>

6720
03:02:59.141 --> 03:02:59.590

03:02:59.590 --> 03:03:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

03:03:00.180 --> 03:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Kio Kid is back.</v>

03:03:01.150 --> 03:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm back.</v>

6724
03:03:01.840 --> 03:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>I didn't mean to cut you bitch.</v>

6725
03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

6726
03:03:03.700 --> 03:03:04.421
<v Speaker 1>How the males,</v>

6727
03:03:04.421 --> 03:03:06.390
<v Speaker 1>the pizza and you tried pescatarian for a while.</v>

6728
03:03:06.391 --> 03:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>How did that go?</v>

6729
03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

6730
03:03:07.580 --> 03:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Quito is the only thing that works for me.</v>

6731
03:03:08.831 --> 03:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not for everyone but Kido works for me.</v>

6732
03:03:10.240 --> 03:03:13.040
<v Speaker 1>But is it work for you in terms of the way you feel or way?</v>

6733
03:03:13.060 --> 03:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>I feel,</v>

6734
03:03:13.600 --> 03:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6735
03:03:13.930 --> 03:03:14.471
<v Speaker 1>the way I feel.</v>

6736
03:03:14.471 --> 03:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to stick to,</v>

6737
03:03:15.311 --> 03:03:16.720
<v Speaker 1>but the way I feel when I'm on it,</v>

6738
03:03:17.050 --> 03:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to cheat.</v>

6739
03:03:18.191 --> 03:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't want carbs.</v>

6740
03:03:19.181 --> 03:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't want that food anymore.</v>

6741
03:03:20.471 --> 03:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>So I'm good.</v>

6742
03:03:21.160 --> 03:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>I go between Kido and low carb.</v>

6743
03:03:23.350 --> 03:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6744
03:03:23.680 --> 03:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>And then occasionally I'll fuck off and have like a Pastrami sub.</v>

6745
03:03:26.711 --> 03:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>I call that Quito Ish.</v>

6746
03:03:28.180 --> 03:03:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I do a thing where I go through whole foods and Erewhon and if I'll look at</v>

6747
03:03:33.371 --> 03:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>people and I try to,</v>

6748
03:03:34.301 --> 03:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>I try to spot the vegans.</v>

6749
03:03:36.350 --> 03:03:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Ah.</v>

6750
03:03:36.930 --> 03:03:37.800
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

6751
03:03:37.870 --> 03:03:39.970
<v Speaker 1>this is so me and they live glasses.</v>

6752
03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

6753
03:03:40.240 --> 03:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>when I see,</v>

6754
03:03:40.960 --> 03:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>when I see,</v>

6755
03:03:41.801 --> 03:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6756
03:03:42.310 --> 03:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>somebody super pale and drawn out and they just look sunken in,</v>

6757
03:03:46.030 --> 03:03:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I'll look in their cart and that's it.</v>

6758
03:03:47.260 --> 03:03:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Right now they've got oats and some seaweed and it's just all vegan stuff.</v>

6759
03:03:52.291 --> 03:03:53.124
<v Speaker 1>And while I was like,</v>

6760
03:03:53.140 --> 03:03:54.460
<v Speaker 1>you could use a little protein.</v>

6761
03:03:54.490 --> 03:03:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

6762
03:03:54.980 --> 03:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>This really is just some people who are just doing it.</v>

6763
03:03:57.250 --> 03:03:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6764
03:03:57.450 --> 03:03:58.040
<v Speaker 1>That's really what it</v>

6765
03:03:58.040 --> 03:03:58.281
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

6766
03:03:58.281 --> 03:03:59.114
<v Speaker 2>You can do it right,</v>

6767
03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:00.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's just like Quito,</v>

6768
03:04:00.620 --> 03:04:03.290
<v Speaker 2>like it requires a lot of thinking and planning.</v>

6769
03:04:03.530 --> 03:04:04.363
<v Speaker 2>Like in order to,</v>

6770
03:04:04.530 --> 03:04:04.820
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

6771
03:04:04.820 --> 03:04:06.860
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people argued online,</v>

6772
03:04:06.861 --> 03:04:07.231
<v Speaker 2>so stu,</v>

6773
03:04:07.231 --> 03:04:08.830
<v Speaker 2>but nobody ever gets to ketosis.</v>

6774
03:04:08.850 --> 03:04:09.560
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>

6775
03:04:09.560 --> 03:04:10.161
<v Speaker 2>Of course they do.</v>

6776
03:04:10.161 --> 03:04:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Stupid.</v>

6777
03:04:10.850 --> 03:04:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Of course they do.</v>

6778
03:04:11.650 --> 03:04:12.650
<v Speaker 2>It's measurable.</v>

6779
03:04:12.830 --> 03:04:14.660
<v Speaker 2>People do it and they find benefit to it.</v>

6780
03:04:14.661 --> 03:04:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't find benefit to it though.</v>

6781
03:04:16.580 --> 03:04:16.731
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

6782
03:04:16.731 --> 03:04:17.960
<v Speaker 2>but it's important to point out,</v>

6783
03:04:18.140 --> 03:04:21.050
<v Speaker 2>it's not hard to get into a state of ketosis.</v>

6784
03:04:21.051 --> 03:04:22.640
<v Speaker 2>You just have to do what's required.</v>

6785
03:04:22.680 --> 03:04:22.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6786
03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:23.930
<v Speaker 2>it can be done.</v>

6787
03:04:23.931 --> 03:04:25.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not difficult to get to.</v>

6788
03:04:25.191 --> 03:04:27.560
<v Speaker 2>And the idea that nobody gets there is just so wrong.</v>

6789
03:04:27.920 --> 03:04:29.030
<v Speaker 2>People get there all the time.</v>

6790
03:04:29.240 --> 03:04:30.910
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of whether or not getting there.</v>

6791
03:04:30.911 --> 03:04:31.850
<v Speaker 2>It will be good for you.</v>

6792
03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:34.790
<v Speaker 2>I'll have people email me or on social media like,</v>

6793
03:04:34.791 --> 03:04:35.031
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

6794
03:04:35.031 --> 03:04:36.320
<v Speaker 2>Kiddo is stupid man.</v>

6795
03:04:36.321 --> 03:04:36.950
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

6796
03:04:36.950 --> 03:04:38.840
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that for a long time.</v>

6797
03:04:38.960 --> 03:04:39.771
<v Speaker 2>It's not for me.</v>

6798
03:04:39.771 --> 03:04:40.604
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

6799
03:04:41.050 --> 03:04:41.450
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

6800
03:04:41.450 --> 03:04:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a fuck it just from Pennside.</v>

6801
03:04:44.480 --> 03:04:47.720
<v Speaker 2>Dom D'agostino has been on it forever and he's been on it forever.</v>

6802
03:04:47.721 --> 03:04:50.720
<v Speaker 2>But Rhonda Patrick was on the other day and she was pointing out how with some</v>

6803
03:04:50.721 --> 03:04:53.570
<v Speaker 2>people it's not the right diet for your boss.</v>

6804
03:04:53.571 --> 03:04:54.950
<v Speaker 2>For me it probably doesn't.</v>

6805
03:04:55.010 --> 03:04:55.231
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6806
03:04:55.231 --> 03:04:55.761
<v Speaker 2>I'd stopped.</v>

6807
03:04:55.761 --> 03:04:56.060
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6808
03:04:56.060 --> 03:04:56.751
<v Speaker 2>I read that book,</v>

6809
03:04:56.751 --> 03:04:57.820
<v Speaker 2>the plant paradox and I,</v>

6810
03:04:57.980 --> 03:04:58.940
<v Speaker 2>I've told this before,</v>

6811
03:04:58.941 --> 03:05:02.690
<v Speaker 2>but I stopped eating bread and those whole wheat things and all the things he</v>

6812
03:05:02.691 --> 03:05:03.141
<v Speaker 2>talks about.</v>

6813
03:05:03.141 --> 03:05:03.380
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

6814
03:05:03.380 --> 03:05:03.651
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

6815
03:05:03.651 --> 03:05:05.210
<v Speaker 2>he's more of about plant based Guy,</v>

6816
03:05:05.211 --> 03:05:09.740
<v Speaker 2>but it did cure my plaque psoriasis up until yesterday cause I started eating</v>

6817
03:05:09.741 --> 03:05:10.370
<v Speaker 2>right again.</v>

6818
03:05:10.370 --> 03:05:11.840
<v Speaker 2>But it cures Siva pitch,</v>

6819
03:05:12.020 --> 03:05:14.660
<v Speaker 2>cured my plaque psoriasis and got rid of it.</v>

6820
03:05:14.810 --> 03:05:16.910
<v Speaker 2>It's that and be all,</v>

6821
03:05:16.911 --> 03:05:17.744
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>

6822
03:05:17.750 --> 03:05:19.790
<v Speaker 2>it works for me depending on what you eat,</v>

6823
03:05:20.350 --> 03:05:21.830
<v Speaker 2>fuck what diet you do.</v>

6824
03:05:21.860 --> 03:05:23.240
<v Speaker 2>That's what is what works.</v>

6825
03:05:23.870 --> 03:05:24.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6826
03:05:24.081 --> 03:05:26.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating real low carb or Kido.</v>

6827
03:05:26.830 --> 03:05:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6828
03:05:27.350 --> 03:05:28.190
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>

6829
03:05:28.370 --> 03:05:30.650
<v Speaker 2>It's either I'm Quito or every now and then I'll,</v>

6830
03:05:30.651 --> 03:05:31.281
<v Speaker 2>I'll definitely,</v>

6831
03:05:31.281 --> 03:05:32.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll feel it when I get off of it.</v>

6832
03:05:32.960 --> 03:05:33.793
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

6833
03:05:33.990 --> 03:05:34.823
<v Speaker 2>That shovels?</v>

6834
03:05:34.840 --> 03:05:35.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6835
03:05:35.330 --> 03:05:38.660
<v Speaker 2>a lot of vegetables but low carbon terms of no refined bullshit,</v>

6836
03:05:38.990 --> 03:05:40.590
<v Speaker 2>no flour.</v>

6837
03:05:40.630 --> 03:05:42.560
<v Speaker 2>And when I get into those states,</v>

6838
03:05:42.800 --> 03:05:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I know when I'm have,</v>

6839
03:05:44.001 --> 03:05:47.450
<v Speaker 2>when I have too much fruit because then I'll start craving it.</v>

6840
03:05:47.600 --> 03:05:49.550
<v Speaker 2>I'll start like craving carbs,</v>

6841
03:05:49.670 --> 03:05:51.440
<v Speaker 2>whereas I can tell,</v>

6842
03:05:51.441 --> 03:05:53.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have tested myself a few times,</v>

6843
03:05:53.241 --> 03:05:57.080
<v Speaker 2>but it's annoying to stick that fucking thing in your hand and extract the blood</v>

6844
03:05:57.081 --> 03:05:58.120
<v Speaker 2>and put it on the tab.</v>

6845
03:05:58.440 --> 03:06:00.840
<v Speaker 2>But you can feel when you're in that state of Ketosis,</v>

6846
03:06:00.841 --> 03:06:03.200
<v Speaker 2>like I'll monitor my diet real steady for five,</v>

6847
03:06:03.201 --> 03:06:07.700
<v Speaker 2>six days and sometimes it'll be like a little dip because I've done it so many</v>

6848
03:06:07.701 --> 03:06:07.970
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

6849
03:06:07.970 --> 03:06:08.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not as noticeable.</v>

6850
03:06:08.811 --> 03:06:11.180
<v Speaker 2>It'd be a little dip and your energy during your workouts.</v>

6851
03:06:11.360 --> 03:06:12.800
<v Speaker 2>But then when I come on the other side of it,</v>

6852
03:06:12.830 --> 03:06:17.600
<v Speaker 2>then as soon as I feel like no hunger pangs during the day at all,</v>

6853
03:06:17.690 --> 03:06:18.560
<v Speaker 2>like I'm good.</v>

6854
03:06:18.860 --> 03:06:19.340
<v Speaker 2>And then I went,</v>

6855
03:06:19.340 --> 03:06:19.640
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

6856
03:06:19.640 --> 03:06:19.911
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

6857
03:06:19.911 --> 03:06:20.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm in,</v>

6858
03:06:20.390 --> 03:06:20.871
<v Speaker 2>I feel.</v>

6859
03:06:20.871 --> 03:06:21.704
<v Speaker 2>And then Gigi,</v>

6860
03:06:21.830 --> 03:06:22.910
<v Speaker 2>can you eat sweet potatoes?</v>

6861
03:06:23.390 --> 03:06:25.250
<v Speaker 2>You can but you can't eat too much.</v>

6862
03:06:25.520 --> 03:06:28.790
<v Speaker 2>Like sweet potato has a lot of fiber in it.</v>

6863
03:06:28.820 --> 03:06:32.600
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why it's one of the better potatoes for you to eat.</v>

6864
03:06:32.601 --> 03:06:36.830
<v Speaker 2>It's got a lot of vitamins and yams and sweet potatoes are fantastic for you.</v>

6865
03:06:36.850 --> 03:06:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6866
03:06:37.250 --> 03:06:39.670
<v Speaker 2>but it's like how much of your are you taking it?</v>

6867
03:06:39.671 --> 03:06:41.450
<v Speaker 2>And how much actual sugar does your body,</v>

6868
03:06:41.451 --> 03:06:42.350
<v Speaker 2>you have to process.</v>

6869
03:06:42.470 --> 03:06:43.850
<v Speaker 2>It was just a small portion of it.</v>

6870
03:06:44.180 --> 03:06:48.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's fine if your overall meals are filled with like really healthy</v>

6871
03:06:48.411 --> 03:06:48.861
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>

6872
03:06:48.861 --> 03:06:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Avocados,</v>

6873
03:06:50.420 --> 03:06:51.740
<v Speaker 2>healthy fats,</v>

6874
03:06:51.990 --> 03:06:52.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6875
03:06:52.460 --> 03:06:55.770
<v Speaker 2>good solid protein with no bullshit and no wheat.</v>

6876
03:06:55.830 --> 03:06:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

6877
03:06:56.130 --> 03:06:57.630
<v Speaker 1>just keep the fuck away from wheat,</v>

6878
03:06:57.840 --> 03:07:01.290
<v Speaker 1>keep the fuck away from pasta or don't you know every now and then have it.</v>

6879
03:07:01.620 --> 03:07:05.310
<v Speaker 1>But if you could just get your most of your diet free of that Shit,</v>

6880
03:07:05.340 --> 03:07:06.390
<v Speaker 1>you'll just feel better.</v>

6881
03:07:06.590 --> 03:07:10.260
<v Speaker 1>It just feel better because you ate too many mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes</v>

6882
03:07:10.440 --> 03:07:11.273
<v Speaker 1>and got to,</v>

6883
03:07:11.490 --> 03:07:12.990
<v Speaker 1>you got to out of Ketosis.</v>

6884
03:07:13.740 --> 03:07:15.450
<v Speaker 1>As long as you're not eating a bullshit.</v>

6885
03:07:15.630 --> 03:07:16.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think that's bad.</v>

6886
03:07:17.390 --> 03:07:17.611
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6887
03:07:17.611 --> 03:07:19.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe your body will have more of an insulin response,</v>

6888
03:07:20.400 --> 03:07:22.770
<v Speaker 1>but I mean you're having all that fiber with your sugar.</v>

6889
03:07:23.040 --> 03:07:25.890
<v Speaker 1>If you're eating a yam or a mashed potato or a sweet potato,</v>

6890
03:07:26.040 --> 03:07:26.640
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

6891
03:07:26.640 --> 03:07:28.620
<v Speaker 1>it's not like eating candy.</v>

6892
03:07:28.660 --> 03:07:30.690
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it's depends on your activity level,</v>

6893
03:07:30.691 --> 03:07:32.280
<v Speaker 1>your show.</v>

6894
03:07:32.281 --> 03:07:33.114
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6895
03:07:33.210 --> 03:07:34.400
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one factor.</v>

6896
03:07:34.440 --> 03:07:36.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a big one as post workout.</v>

6897
03:07:37.080 --> 03:07:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Like how many people work out like you did when you were fighting?</v>

6898
03:07:40.740 --> 03:07:45.300
<v Speaker 1>How many fucking human beings know what it's like to put in those hard two a</v>

6899
03:07:45.301 --> 03:07:49.140
<v Speaker 1>days and just be almost no one fried four weeks into camp?</v>

6900
03:07:49.141 --> 03:07:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Realize you've got two to go and speak to it,</v>

6901
03:07:52.261 --> 03:07:52.621
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6902
03:07:52.621 --> 03:07:53.454
<v Speaker 1>Speak to,</v>

6903
03:07:54.660 --> 03:07:55.141

6904
03:07:55.141 --> 03:07:55.951
<v Speaker 1>Where's you're nauseous.</v>

6905
03:07:55.951 --> 03:07:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Speak to them in the my coach Tony Jeffrey to you,</v>

6906
03:07:58.760 --> 03:07:59.371
<v Speaker 1>he gets it.</v>

6907
03:07:59.371 --> 03:08:01.710
<v Speaker 1>He was an Olympic boxer and bucks a professional.</v>

6908
03:08:01.830 --> 03:08:02.640
<v Speaker 1>He'd go,</v>

6909
03:08:02.640 --> 03:08:02.821
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6910
03:08:02.821 --> 03:08:04.020
<v Speaker 1>you're three weeks in you.</v>

6911
03:08:04.021 --> 03:08:05.670
<v Speaker 1>You have four more weeks of this Brendan,</v>

6912
03:08:05.850 --> 03:08:08.020
<v Speaker 1>let's get to work this fucking me.</v>

6913
03:08:08.190 --> 03:08:09.023
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

6914
03:08:09.180 --> 03:08:13.440
<v Speaker 1>That's why a guy like you has to like keep an eye on is an appetite after you</v>

6915
03:08:13.441 --> 03:08:14.370
<v Speaker 1>get out of fighting.</v>

6916
03:08:14.390 --> 03:08:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

6917
03:08:14.820 --> 03:08:17.760
<v Speaker 1>because you're not broken down like that all day anymore where you could just</v>

6918
03:08:17.761 --> 03:08:20.700
<v Speaker 1>fuck and shovel it in people.</v>

6919
03:08:20.701 --> 03:08:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Let her have fun.</v>

6920
03:08:21.360 --> 03:08:21.631
<v Speaker 1>Any,</v>

6921
03:08:21.631 --> 03:08:25.140
<v Speaker 1>anytime you're doing anything that's super difficult and you're working out</v>

6922
03:08:25.141 --> 03:08:26.220
<v Speaker 1>twice in a day,</v>

6923
03:08:26.610 --> 03:08:26.821
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

6924
03:08:26.821 --> 03:08:31.821
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be hungry all the time and your body gets into that space</v>

6925
03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:35.460
<v Speaker 1>because even back then I wish I was more knowledgeable on diet and stuff like</v>

6926
03:08:35.461 --> 03:08:35.730
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

6927
03:08:35.730 --> 03:08:38.820
<v Speaker 1>I hired some nutritionist but it never really clicked with anyone.</v>

6928
03:08:39.060 --> 03:08:41.460
<v Speaker 1>But I have more knowledge now on</v>

6929
03:08:43.170 --> 03:08:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus Christ and all syrup almost through.</v>

6930
03:08:45.230 --> 03:08:46.170
<v Speaker 1>I just threw up in my mouth.</v>

6931
03:08:46.200 --> 03:08:47.010
<v Speaker 1>It's all good though.</v>

6932
03:08:47.010 --> 03:08:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Back to the Taquito Diet.</v>

6933
03:08:48.300 --> 03:08:48.811
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

6934
03:08:48.811 --> 03:08:49.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6935
03:08:49.370 --> 03:08:50.390
<v Speaker 1>I have more knowledge now.</v>

6936
03:08:50.440 --> 03:08:51.820
<v Speaker 1>You say Taquito Diet.</v>

6937

03:08:52.760 --> 03:08:53.593
<v Speaker 1>I'm fun.</v>

6939
03:08:54.030 --> 03:08:55.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm struggle city.</v>

6940
03:08:55.820 --> 03:08:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I just wrote in my mouth,</v>

6941
03:08:57.150 --> 03:09:02.150
<v Speaker 1>my breath smells like fucking throw up anyways.</v>

6942
03:09:02.450 --> 03:09:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6943
03:09:02.820 --> 03:09:06.780
<v Speaker 1>I wish I had more knowledge back then when I was fighting on diet and stuff</v>

6944
03:09:06.810 --> 03:09:07.550
<v Speaker 1>cause I did it.</v>

6945
03:09:07.550 --> 03:09:08.490
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to people,</v>

6946
03:09:08.491 --> 03:09:09.410
<v Speaker 1>I try to figure it out and like,</v>

6947
03:09:09.640 --> 03:09:10.620
<v Speaker 1>you're burning so many calories,</v>

6948
03:09:10.621 --> 03:09:11.401
<v Speaker 1>eat whatever you want.</v>

6949
03:09:11.401 --> 03:09:11.611
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

6950
03:09:11.611 --> 03:09:11.821
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

6951
03:09:11.821 --> 03:09:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the right answer.</v>

6952
03:09:13.700 --> 03:09:16.710
<v Speaker 1>When I played at University of Colorado and I would ask nutrition.</v>

6953
03:09:16.711 --> 03:09:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

6954
03:09:17.040 --> 03:09:17.191
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

6955
03:09:17.191 --> 03:09:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I feel like this yogurt you've given us some gated,</v>

6956
03:09:19.351 --> 03:09:21.120
<v Speaker 1>it has so much fucking sugar that she goes,</v>

6957
03:09:21.360 --> 03:09:22.020
<v Speaker 1>you're fine.</v>

6958
03:09:22.020 --> 03:09:23.010
<v Speaker 1>You're going to burn it off.</v>

6959
03:09:23.030 --> 03:09:23.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

6960
03:09:23.300 --> 03:09:23.910
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

6961
03:09:23.910 --> 03:09:25.170
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't seem right to me,</v>

6962
03:09:25.171 --> 03:09:25.620
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

6963
03:09:25.620 --> 03:09:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6964
03:09:25.830 --> 03:09:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I look at everyone's bodies.</v>

6965
03:09:26.851 --> 03:09:29.340
<v Speaker 1>We look like shit that that is true,</v>

6966
03:09:29.341 --> 03:09:30.760
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

6967
03:09:30.790 --> 03:09:34.890
<v Speaker 1>you definitely have different requirements than a person who doesn't do the kind</v>

6968
03:09:34.891 --> 03:09:36.110
<v Speaker 1>of working out that well.</v>

6969
03:09:36.120 --> 03:09:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Your body will burn a certain amount of sugar and a certain amount,</v>

6970
03:09:39.331 --> 03:09:42.920
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to fruits or anything complex hundred percent but I get</v>

6971
03:09:42.921 --> 03:09:44.270
<v Speaker 1>it burn more than know it.</v>

6972
03:09:44.360 --> 03:09:45.510
<v Speaker 1>You're burning those calories.</v>

6973
03:09:45.511 --> 03:09:48.660
<v Speaker 1>You can put good fuel in and still get calories.</v>

6974
03:09:48.900 --> 03:09:51.270
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to get it from cheeseburgers and candy.</v>

6975
03:09:51.271 --> 03:09:53.500
<v Speaker 1>You can get it through high quality foods.</v>

6976
03:09:53.530 --> 03:09:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Even still bored.</v>

6977
03:09:54.880 --> 03:09:57.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying getting at is in terms of like overall performance,</v>

6978
03:09:57.371 --> 03:09:58.450
<v Speaker 1>if you want to do it perfectly,</v>

6979
03:09:58.451 --> 03:10:01.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if Kido is the way to go for like a fighter.</v>

6980
03:10:01.330 --> 03:10:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I think the the strains and requirements in your body in terms of like the</v>

6981
03:10:05.051 --> 03:10:07.570
<v Speaker 1>amount of fuel your body needs to burn.</v>

6982
03:10:07.780 --> 03:10:10.540
<v Speaker 1>There's an argument that especially for a lot of people,</v>

6983
03:10:10.541 --> 03:10:11.231
<v Speaker 1>not for everybody,</v>

6984
03:10:11.231 --> 03:10:16.231
<v Speaker 1>but for a lot of people having more carbohydrates in your diet then is required</v>

6985
03:10:16.331 --> 03:10:19.690
<v Speaker 1>to stay in a state of Ketosis or did I talk to,</v>

6986
03:10:20.290 --> 03:10:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I want to say Lance Palmer.</v>

6987
03:10:21.790 --> 03:10:22.930
<v Speaker 1>I silence if I'm off on this.</v>

6988
03:10:23.350 --> 03:10:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Lance told me one of the fighters have had on my show goes man,</v>

6989
03:10:27.131 --> 03:10:30.250
<v Speaker 1>for the last three or the three weeks before my fight,</v>

6990
03:10:30.370 --> 03:10:31.061
<v Speaker 1>he has to make weight.</v>

6991
03:10:31.061 --> 03:10:31.271
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

6992
03:10:31.271 --> 03:10:33.070
<v Speaker 1>I go Kido and I make you wait easily.</v>

6993
03:10:33.071 --> 03:10:33.311
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

6994
03:10:33.311 --> 03:10:34.150
<v Speaker 1>I've never felt better.</v>

6995
03:10:34.570 --> 03:10:34.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6996
03:10:34.901 --> 03:10:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Brian Caraway said that to Brian Caraway or talked to him,</v>

6997
03:10:38.231 --> 03:10:39.400
<v Speaker 1>so I did that for me.</v>

6998
03:10:39.460 --> 03:10:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Might be Lance Palmer might be,</v>

6999
03:10:41.500 --> 03:10:41.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7000
03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:42.370
<v Speaker 1>you look,</v>

7001
03:10:42.370 --> 03:10:44.310
<v Speaker 1>everybody's body responds differently.</v>

7002
03:10:44.340 --> 03:10:45.280
<v Speaker 1>That's another problem.</v>

7003
03:10:45.550 --> 03:10:46.080
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's,</v>

7004
03:10:46.080 --> 03:10:47.110
<v Speaker 1>her body responds,</v>

7005
03:10:47.140 --> 03:10:48.020
<v Speaker 1>responds differently.</v>

7006
03:10:48.130 --> 03:10:50.290
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] people ask me that too.</v>

7007
03:10:50.291 --> 03:10:51.011
<v Speaker 1>This is what I do,</v>

7008
03:10:51.011 --> 03:10:51.161

<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's free.</v>

7010
03:10:51.830 --> 03:10:53.440
<v Speaker 1>This say for me when I'm on the road,</v>

7011
03:10:53.590 --> 03:10:54.820
<v Speaker 1>I can find Keto meals,</v>

7012
03:10:55.120 --> 03:10:55.601
<v Speaker 1>meals.</v>

7013
03:10:55.601 --> 03:10:56.610
<v Speaker 1>When I go to a steakhouse,</v>

7014
03:10:56.650 --> 03:10:57.450
<v Speaker 1>it's easy.</v>

7015
03:10:57.450 --> 03:10:58.360
<v Speaker 1>It's super easy for me.</v>

7016
03:10:59.780 --> 03:11:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Medicine.</v>

7017
03:11:00.370 --> 03:11:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7026
03:11:12.700 --> 03:11:13.870
<v Speaker 1>You could brush your skin with them.</v>

7027
03:11:14.080 --> 03:11:14.681
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>

7028

<v Speaker 1>Just so we call it something else.</v>

7048
03:11:43.571 --> 03:11:44.261
<v Speaker 1>Slot toes.</v>

7049
03:11:44.261 --> 03:11:44.590
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

7050
03:11:44.590 --> 03:11:45.730
<v Speaker 1>They look like slot though.</v>

7051
03:11:45.970 --> 03:11:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I just made that up now if it is what it looks like,</v>

7052
03:11:48.640 --> 03:11:49.473
<v Speaker 1>I'm sick,</v>

7053
03:11:50.500 --> 03:11:51.250
<v Speaker 1>but Brazil,</v>

7054
03:11:51.250 --> 03:11:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Brazil nuts.</v>

7055
03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>

7056
03:11:53.440 --> 03:11:55.270
<v Speaker 1>I heard that they're good.</v>

7057
03:11:55.330 --> 03:11:57.950
<v Speaker 1>They good for sports and for your liver or some bullshit.</v>

7058
03:11:58.010 --> 03:12:02.080
<v Speaker 1>But I do get all brides decides to start chopping them up six,</v>

7059
03:12:02.081 --> 03:12:02.950
<v Speaker 1>seven at a time,</v>

7060
03:12:02.951 --> 03:12:04.120
<v Speaker 1>putting him in Mashiach.</v>

7061
03:12:04.330 --> 03:12:08.230
<v Speaker 1>That's all good problem is I inherited a little of the old,</v>

7062
03:12:08.610 --> 03:12:09.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7063
03:12:09.090 --> 03:12:09.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7064
03:12:09.330 --> 03:12:10.061
<v Speaker 1>allergic stuff.</v>

7065
03:12:10.061 --> 03:12:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Now when you are allergic and you keep eating something,</v>

7066
03:12:12.340 --> 03:12:15.160
<v Speaker 1>you'll develop more and more of a reaction with less.</v>

7067
03:12:15.700 --> 03:12:17.920
<v Speaker 1>So I would notice that all of a sudden,</v>

7068
03:12:17.921 --> 03:12:18.880
<v Speaker 1>periodically I'd like,</v>

7069
03:12:18.881 --> 03:12:20.740
<v Speaker 1>my throat would be sore.</v>

7070
03:12:20.741 --> 03:12:22.750
<v Speaker 1>It just be swollen and sore.</v>

7071
03:12:23.050 --> 03:12:23.561
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

7072
03:12:23.561 --> 03:12:24.550
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going?</v>

7073
03:12:24.551 --> 03:12:25.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sick but my throat.</v>

7074
03:12:26.080 --> 03:12:26.913
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

7075
03:12:27.280 --> 03:12:27.840
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

7076
03:12:27.840 --> 03:12:28.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7077
03:12:28.120 --> 03:12:29.650
<v Speaker 1>my entire mouth,</v>

7078
03:12:29.690 --> 03:12:32.380
<v Speaker 1>what one point swelled up and like,</v>

7079
03:12:32.440 --> 03:12:35.290
<v Speaker 1>it looked like my roof of my mouth had been burned and I,</v>

7080
03:12:35.291 --> 03:12:36.730
<v Speaker 1>and my dentist goes,</v>

7081
03:12:36.731 --> 03:12:39.250
<v Speaker 1>did you burn the entire roof of your mouth?</v>

7082
03:12:39.251 --> 03:12:39.640
<v Speaker 1>I went,</v>

7083
03:12:39.640 --> 03:12:40.473
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

7084
03:12:40.720 --> 03:12:41.553
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

7085
03:12:41.770 --> 03:12:42.640
<v Speaker 1>your mouth,</v>

7086
03:12:42.760 --> 03:12:44.320
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's been burned.</v>

7087
03:12:44.350 --> 03:12:45.250

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

7105
03:13:05.991 --> 03:13:06.824

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

7114
03:13:15.540 --> 03:13:17.750
<v Speaker 3>The tick is becoming less and less rare.</v>

7115
03:13:17.880 --> 03:13:19.070
<v Speaker 3>That's what's really a tick borne.</v>

7116
03:13:19.071 --> 03:13:20.480
<v Speaker 3>Diseases are fucking horrifying.</v>

7117
03:13:21.050 --> 03:13:23.560
<v Speaker 3>There are so many people out there that are suffering from chronic,</v>

7118
03:13:24.190 --> 03:13:24.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

7119
03:13:24.560 --> 03:13:25.310
<v Speaker 3>they don't care.</v>

7120
03:13:25.310 --> 03:13:26.330
<v Speaker 3>They don't catch it quick enough.</v>

7121
03:13:26.331 --> 03:13:28.460
<v Speaker 3>They don't get the antibiotics and their system quick enough.</v>

7122
03:13:28.461 --> 03:13:29.570
<v Speaker 3>And I know somebody who has that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>her dad got a a shot for Lyme disease.</v>

7125
03:13:35.121 --> 03:13:39.200
<v Speaker 3>They used to give you a vaccination and he caught Lyme disease from the</v>

7126
03:13:39.201 --> 03:13:40.034
<v Speaker 3>vaccination.</v>

7127
03:13:40.610 --> 03:13:41.930
<v Speaker 3>They don't do that vaccination.</v>

7128

<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>

7130
03:13:46.581 --> 03:13:46.850
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

7131
03:13:46.850 --> 03:13:47.271
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

7132
03:13:47.271 --> 03:13:50.350

7133
03:13:50.410 --> 03:13:52.460
<v Speaker 3>but everybody's result is different.</v>

7134
03:13:53.120 --> 03:13:56.210
<v Speaker 3>Some people catch it too late and it's like chronic.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They thought for six months he or I was about three months.</v>

7141
03:14:06.141 --> 03:14:10.140
<v Speaker 3>They thought he had the disease that killed Bernie Mac and they thought he had</v>

7147
03:14:16.040 --> 03:14:17.000

<v Speaker 3>He had on the outside,</v>

7186
03:15:19.281 --> 03:15:22.520
<v Speaker 3>got it from probably from his grandfather who he hadn't been exposed to when he</v>

7187

7194
03:15:27.471 --> 03:15:28.910
<v Speaker 3>So with tuberculosis,</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

7198
03:15:38.541 --> 03:15:39.201
<v Speaker 3>not just that.</v>

7199
03:15:39.201 --> 03:15:40.430
<v Speaker 3>It made him colorblind.</v>

7200
03:15:40.820 --> 03:15:42.410
<v Speaker 3>So he can't see certain colors.</v>

03:15:45.861 --> 03:15:47.180
<v Speaker 3>But he went through some shit.</v>

7206
03:15:47.300 --> 03:15:48.760
<v Speaker 3>The way he handled that was amazing.</v>

7207
03:15:48.761 --> 03:15:49.260
<v Speaker 3>This.</v>

7208

<v Speaker 1>You and me and Patty Jenkins and you couldn't drink and not only could I not</v>

7232
03:16:25.231 --> 03:16:26.010
<v Speaker 1>drink,</v>

7233
03:16:26.010 --> 03:16:30.480
<v Speaker 1>my head felt like I had like a led helmet sitting on my head.</v>

7234
03:16:30.481 --> 03:16:31.170
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

7235
03:16:31.170 --> 03:16:31.680
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

7236
03:16:31.680 --> 03:16:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe how shitty I feel.</v>

7237
03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:36.570
<v Speaker 1>I feel so weak and so shitty and I just gotten on him.</v>

7238
03:16:36.571 --> 03:16:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I was only on him for a couple of days and I remember thinking like,</v>

7239
03:16:40.201 --> 03:16:40.441
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

7240
03:16:40.441 --> 03:16:42.120
<v Speaker 1>how could anybody fight on that?</v>

7241
03:16:42.210 --> 03:16:43.230
<v Speaker 1>How about guys fight with them?</v>

7242
03:16:43.650 --> 03:16:44.910
<v Speaker 1>They're crazy.</v>

7243
03:16:44.940 --> 03:16:47.300
<v Speaker 1>It drains you so bad.</v>

7244
03:16:47.610 --> 03:16:49.770
<v Speaker 1>I didn't train obviously because I had staff.</v>

7245
03:16:49.771 --> 03:16:50.670
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to give it to anybody,</v>

7246
03:16:50.671 --> 03:16:53.360
<v Speaker 1>but I did try to use some weights and do some working out.</v>

7247
03:16:53.370 --> 03:16:54.210
<v Speaker 1>It was useless.</v>

7248
03:16:54.211 --> 03:16:55.170
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to hit the bag.</v>

7249
03:16:55.270 --> 03:16:56.420
<v Speaker 1>Use Lists.</v>

7250
03:16:56.440 --> 03:16:57.081
<v Speaker 1>That's what's crazy.</v>

7251
03:16:57.081 --> 03:16:58.760
<v Speaker 1>When you find those slides like yeah,</v>

7252
03:16:58.800 --> 03:17:00.660
<v Speaker 1>he won that fight and he was on the antibiotic choice.</v>

7253
03:17:00.880 --> 03:17:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7254
03:17:01.300 --> 03:17:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Fuck fucking Kevin Lee,</v>

7255
03:17:03.180 --> 03:17:03.900
<v Speaker 1>when he fought,</v>

7256
03:17:03.900 --> 03:17:07.080
<v Speaker 1>when he fought against Tony Ferguson and I looked at his chest the moment he</v>

7257
03:17:07.081 --> 03:17:08.130
<v Speaker 1>walked into the cage and they're like,</v>

7258
03:17:08.131 --> 03:17:11.660
<v Speaker 1>that it staff or you can see it's Boucher.</v>

7259
03:17:11.780 --> 03:17:12.613
<v Speaker 1>DDF staff.</v>

7260
03:17:12.950 --> 03:17:14.460
<v Speaker 1>He was on antibiotics.</v>

7261
03:17:14.490 --> 03:17:15.271
<v Speaker 1>No way,</v>

7262
03:17:15.271 --> 03:17:16.680
<v Speaker 1>cause I didn't come here to tap.</v>

7263
03:17:16.890 --> 03:17:18.630
<v Speaker 1>That's sluggish.</v>

7264
03:17:18.631 --> 03:17:18.941
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

7265
03:17:18.941 --> 03:17:19.021
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7266
03:17:19.021 --> 03:17:20.790
<v Speaker 1>I was on antibiotics the whole time.</v>

7267
03:17:20.910 --> 03:17:21.690
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

7268
03:17:21.690 --> 03:17:23.880
<v Speaker 1>You could see Shasha on antibiotics.</v>

7269
03:17:24.150 --> 03:17:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Holy.</v>

7270
03:17:24.720 --> 03:17:26.980
<v Speaker 1>She could see the Kevin Lee had a staff,</v>

7271
03:17:26.981 --> 03:17:28.730
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent extra.</v>

7272
03:17:28.731 --> 03:17:29.790
<v Speaker 1>He had his,</v>

7273
03:17:29.930 --> 03:17:33.780
<v Speaker 1>he had a giant Welt on his chest and I pointed it out to Daniel.</v>

7274
03:17:34.380 --> 03:17:36.720
<v Speaker 1>I pointed out like it wasn't look like staffing supplier is.</v>

7275
03:17:36.721 --> 03:17:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Someone in in Daniel's ears were saying,</v>

7276
03:17:38.790 --> 03:17:39.870
<v Speaker 1>do not talk about it,</v>

7277
03:17:39.900 --> 03:17:40.740
<v Speaker 1>do not talk about it.</v>

7278
03:17:40.741 --> 03:17:41.550
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

7279
03:17:41.550 --> 03:17:41.821
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

7280
03:17:41.821 --> 03:17:42.930
<v Speaker 1>that looks like staff to me.</v>

7281
03:17:43.740 --> 03:17:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Right when you said it,</v>

7282
03:17:44.581 --> 03:17:44.881
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

7283
03:17:44.881 --> 03:17:45.511
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>

7284
03:17:45.511 --> 03:17:46.770
<v Speaker 1>I hope Joe's right man.</v>

7285
03:17:46.860 --> 03:17:47.461
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

7286
03:17:47.461 --> 03:17:48.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm right.</v>

7287
03:17:48.210 --> 03:17:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

7288
03:17:48.750 --> 03:17:49.920
<v Speaker 1>there's no way that could be anything.</v>

7289
03:17:50.450 --> 03:17:53.970
<v Speaker 1>It was swollen like something either happened,</v>

7290
03:17:53.971 --> 03:17:55.200
<v Speaker 1>like maybe he got burnt callbacks,</v>

7291
03:17:55.230 --> 03:17:56.130
<v Speaker 1>states check can,</v>

7292
03:17:56.131 --> 03:17:56.941
<v Speaker 1>I haven't heard anything.</v>

7293
03:17:56.941 --> 03:17:58.560
<v Speaker 1>You think you'd be taking a break?</v>

7294
03:17:58.590 --> 03:18:01.780
<v Speaker 1>You know the drawing board is coach comen.</v>

7295
03:18:01.820 --> 03:18:02.670
<v Speaker 1>How's Robert Falls?</v>

7296
03:18:02.671 --> 03:18:03.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

03:18:03.170 --> 03:18:04.003
<v Speaker 1>it was his coach.</v>

7298
03:18:04.020 --> 03:18:04.890
<v Speaker 1>That's a bummer.</v>

7299
03:18:04.920 --> 03:18:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Robert Falls is a great guy.</v>

7300
03:18:07.440 --> 03:18:09.090
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know he committed suicide up yet.</v>

7301
03:18:09.210 --> 03:18:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I knew that he died.</v>

7302
03:18:10.460 --> 03:18:10.671
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

7303
03:18:10.671 --> 03:18:10.920
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

7304
03:18:10.920 --> 03:18:12.660
<v Speaker 1>I heard that there had been a rumor about that,</v>

7305
03:18:12.661 --> 03:18:14.190
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't about her suicide.</v>

7306
03:18:14.370 --> 03:18:15.960
<v Speaker 1>This brother committed suicide as well.</v>

7307
03:18:16.210 --> 03:18:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7308
03:18:16.540 --> 03:18:16.920
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

03:18:16.920 --> 03:18:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

7310
03:18:18.210 --> 03:18:19.170
<v Speaker 1>They're poor parents.</v>

7311
03:18:21.180 --> 03:18:22.290
<v Speaker 1>He was a really,</v>

7312
03:18:22.291 --> 03:18:23.280
<v Speaker 1>really nice guy.</v>

7313
03:18:23.930 --> 03:18:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Very smart guy too.</v>

7314
03:18:25.260 --> 03:18:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Very smart guy.</v>

7315
03:18:26.460 --> 03:18:27.600
<v Speaker 1>That's such a bummer man.</v>

7316
03:18:28.530 --> 03:18:29.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7317
03:18:29.040 --> 03:18:32.130
<v Speaker 1>and who knows what,</v>

7318
03:18:32.160 --> 03:18:35.300
<v Speaker 1>what causes someone who is so well loved and so liked.</v>

7319
03:18:35.750 --> 03:18:35.981
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7320
03:18:35.981 --> 03:18:36.210
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

7321
03:18:36.210 --> 03:18:41.210
<v Speaker 1>that's a great argument for like chemical issues versus like a,</v>

7322
03:18:41.810 --> 03:18:44.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could tell some people just don't have good lives.</v>

7323
03:18:44.910 --> 03:18:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Everything's going bad for them.</v>

7324
03:18:46.171 --> 03:18:48.310
<v Speaker 1>They want to end their life cause they can't take the pain.</v>

7325
03:18:48.460 --> 03:18:51.190
<v Speaker 1>But then there's other people that are like him that are doing really well,</v>

7326
03:18:51.640 --> 03:18:51.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7327
03:18:51.911 --> 03:18:52.451
<v Speaker 1>and you got to go,</v>

7328
03:18:52.451 --> 03:18:52.781
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

7329
03:18:52.781 --> 03:18:55.610
<v Speaker 1>what is straight man to fuck it dude is a fucking issue.</v>

7330
03:18:55.870 --> 03:18:56.290
<v Speaker 1>And we have,</v>

7331
03:18:56.290 --> 03:19:00.760
<v Speaker 1>we all have this real problem when it comes to people doing things that we would</v>

7332
03:19:00.761 --> 03:19:01.540
<v Speaker 1>think would,</v>

7333
03:19:01.540 --> 03:19:02.373
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7334
03:19:02.380 --> 03:19:07.030
<v Speaker 1>you'd consider to be something that someone who doesn't have control of</v>

7335
03:19:07.031 --> 03:19:07.840
<v Speaker 1>themselves does.</v>

7336
03:19:07.840 --> 03:19:09.010
<v Speaker 1>And we shun that.</v>

7337
03:19:09.011 --> 03:19:09.341
<v Speaker 1>We won't,</v>

7338
03:19:09.341 --> 03:19:10.780
<v Speaker 1>we don't like that it bothers us,</v>

7339
03:19:11.200 --> 03:19:16.200
<v Speaker 1>but there's a reality to like pain and suffering that we have to address.</v>

7340
03:19:17.680 --> 03:19:18.460
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

7341
03:19:18.460 --> 03:19:21.880
<v Speaker 1>shaming someone for wanting to end their life is not sound.</v>

7342
03:19:22.170 --> 03:19:22.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7343
03:19:22.750 --> 03:19:25.390
<v Speaker 1>until you've been faced with that kind of despair,</v>

7344
03:19:25.600 --> 03:19:26.890
<v Speaker 1>if you're that,</v>

7345
03:19:26.950 --> 03:19:30.880
<v Speaker 1>that if the juror despair level is to the point where you take your own life,</v>

7346
03:19:31.090 --> 03:19:35.260
<v Speaker 1>you have my utmost and everlasting sympathy.</v>

7347
03:19:35.500 --> 03:19:37.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a judgment on that.</v>

7348
03:19:37.240 --> 03:19:38.260
<v Speaker 1>I'd never been there.</v>

7349
03:19:38.261 --> 03:19:39.840
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that I'd be a core,</v>

7350
03:19:39.890 --> 03:19:40.570
<v Speaker 1>get it,</v>

7351
03:19:40.570 --> 03:19:41.500
<v Speaker 1>get it together,</v>

7352
03:19:41.800 --> 03:19:46.090
<v Speaker 1>usually had a rational decision for someone who's just commit suicide is the</v>

7353
03:19:46.091 --> 03:19:49.360
<v Speaker 1>only way out of this terrible situation is death.</v>

7354
03:19:49.390 --> 03:19:50.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a rational decision.</v>

7355
03:19:51.250 --> 03:19:51.521
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

7356
03:19:51.521 --> 03:19:52.000
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

7357
03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:53.980
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing but my ultimate,</v>

7358
03:19:55.150 --> 03:19:57.430
<v Speaker 1>all you can do is shake your head and feel sad.</v>

7359
03:19:57.960 --> 03:19:58.690
<v Speaker 1>That's judgmental.</v>

7360
03:19:58.690 --> 03:20:00.220
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking completely horrible.</v>

7361
03:20:00.250 --> 03:20:00.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7362
03:20:00.491 --> 03:20:03.760
<v Speaker 1>when you stop and think about the idea of wanting to end your life,</v>

7363
03:20:03.810 --> 03:20:04.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7364
03:20:04.031 --> 03:20:04.781
<v Speaker 1>I feel lucky,</v>

7365
03:20:04.781 --> 03:20:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't call it that,</v>

7366
03:20:06.310 --> 03:20:08.860
<v Speaker 1>that level of Serotonin in my brain,</v>

7367
03:20:09.760 --> 03:20:10.391
<v Speaker 1>but I think it,</v>

7368
03:20:10.391 --> 03:20:10.990
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

7369
03:20:10.990 --> 03:20:13.600
<v Speaker 1>I think for a lot of people it goes back to,</v>

7370
03:20:14.270 --> 03:20:14.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7371
03:20:14.650 --> 03:20:15.151
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

7372
03:20:15.151 --> 03:20:15.880
<v Speaker 1>what's the chem,</v>

7373
03:20:15.880 --> 03:20:18.610
<v Speaker 1>what's the chemical reaction that's going on in your brain?</v>

7374
03:20:18.611 --> 03:20:19.200
<v Speaker 1>What they've done?</v>

7375
03:20:19.200 --> 03:20:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>

7376
03:20:19.670 --> 03:20:19.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7377
03:20:19.990 --> 03:20:20.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7378
03:20:20.291 --> 03:20:20.411
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

7379
03:20:20.411 --> 03:20:20.630
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

7380
03:20:20.630 --> 03:20:21.800
<v Speaker 1>is it just an,</v>

7381
03:20:21.860 --> 03:20:25.060
<v Speaker 1>an issue with some sort of a disorder where there's like something that's not</v>

7382
03:20:25.061 --> 03:20:29.200
<v Speaker 1>producing the right amount of chemicals or is it a problem of your past?</v>

7383
03:20:29.230 --> 03:20:31.000
<v Speaker 1>Like it trauma,</v>

7384
03:20:31.001 --> 03:20:31.780
<v Speaker 1>inflation of dot.</v>

7385
03:20:31.780 --> 03:20:32.620
<v Speaker 1>A lot of different factors.</v>

7386
03:20:32.621 --> 03:20:36.810
<v Speaker 1>But one thing they know is that you have a set point for your serotonin.</v>

7387
03:20:36.820 --> 03:20:37.211
<v Speaker 1>And usually,</v>

7388
03:20:37.211 --> 03:20:37.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7389
03:20:37.421 --> 03:20:39.550
<v Speaker 1>like certain people like me,</v>

7390
03:20:39.551 --> 03:20:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I probably have a serotonin level from one to 10 at usually seven to eight,</v>

7391
03:20:44.470 --> 03:20:44.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7392
03:20:44.771 --> 03:20:45.910
<v Speaker 1>no matter what's going on,</v>

7393
03:20:45.911 --> 03:20:46.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm always,</v>

7394
03:20:47.320 --> 03:20:48.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm just lucky.</v>

7395
03:20:48.310 --> 03:20:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I just very rarely get depressed.</v>

7396
03:20:50.561 --> 03:20:51.394
<v Speaker 1>And if I do,</v>

7397
03:20:51.490 --> 03:20:53.740
<v Speaker 1>it's a mild sort of haze.</v>

7398
03:20:54.340 --> 03:20:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Some people they could,</v>

7399
03:20:55.780 --> 03:20:58.270
<v Speaker 1>they could invent the cure for every disease.</v>

7400
03:20:58.271 --> 03:21:00.820
<v Speaker 1>In the world and win the lottery and all this stuff.</v>

7401
03:21:01.440 --> 03:21:04.900
<v Speaker 1>They just go back to their serotonin levels being at four or whatever,</v>

7402
03:21:04.901 --> 03:21:05.591
<v Speaker 1>and it's just,</v>

7403
03:21:05.591 --> 03:21:06.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

7404
03:21:06.040 --> 03:21:07.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a little bit more complicated than that,</v>

7405
03:21:07.601 --> 03:21:09.070
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's a,</v>

7406
03:21:09.190 --> 03:21:09.401
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

7407
03:21:09.401 --> 03:21:11.740
<v Speaker 1>there's some people that are just never happy for whatever reason,</v>

7408
03:21:11.741 --> 03:21:12.311
<v Speaker 1>whatever reason,</v>

7409
03:21:12.311 --> 03:21:17.311
<v Speaker 1>chemically or whether it can be eight in the apprentices does always that.</v>

7410
03:21:18.431 --> 03:21:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Neil's always like,</v>

7411
03:21:20.240 --> 03:21:22.120
<v Speaker 1>as always been melancholy.</v>

7412
03:21:22.450 --> 03:21:27.340
<v Speaker 1>He's always been sort of in that blue region and I've always been so brilliant,</v>

7413
03:21:27.850 --> 03:21:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Neil Brennan,</v>

7414
03:21:28.340 --> 03:21:29.740
<v Speaker 1>so when you hear him talking about it,</v>

7415
03:21:29.741 --> 03:21:30.371
<v Speaker 1>like he was like,</v>

7416
03:21:30.371 --> 03:21:30.491
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

7417
03:21:30.491 --> 03:21:32.180
<v Speaker 1>with the Chappelle stuff and he's like,</v>

7418
03:21:32.181 --> 03:21:32.331
<v Speaker 1>Yo man,</v>

7419
03:21:32.331 --> 03:21:33.030
<v Speaker 1>it was just here.</v>

7420
03:21:33.030 --> 03:21:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Myths,</v>

7421
03:21:33.410 --> 03:21:34.090
<v Speaker 1>chef,</v>

7422
03:21:34.090 --> 03:21:34.630
<v Speaker 1>medication.</v>

7423
03:21:34.630 --> 03:21:35.141
<v Speaker 1>I'm just here.</v>

7424
03:21:35.141 --> 03:21:36.430
<v Speaker 1>I just go through the motions.</v>

7425
03:21:36.490 --> 03:21:37.660
<v Speaker 1>He's a very smart guy.</v>

7426
03:21:37.680 --> 03:21:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

7427
03:21:38.280 --> 03:21:39.113
<v Speaker 1>he's brilliant.</v>

7428
03:21:39.400 --> 03:21:42.220
<v Speaker 1>I think there's an also an issue with people that are really smart.</v>

7429
03:21:42.250 --> 03:21:43.630
<v Speaker 1>They look at the futility of it all.</v>

7430
03:21:44.260 --> 03:21:47.100
<v Speaker 1>It's sometimes harder for them to overcome this,</v>

7431
03:21:47.120 --> 03:21:47.953
<v Speaker 1>game it off.</v>

7432
03:21:49.000 --> 03:21:49.281
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

7433
03:21:49.281 --> 03:21:49.790
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

7434
03:21:49.790 --> 03:21:50.091
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

7435
03:21:50.091 --> 03:21:51.260
<v Speaker 1>he'd suffer from depression.</v>

7436
03:21:51.570 --> 03:21:52.220
<v Speaker 1>Are you doing?</v>

7437
03:21:52.220 --> 03:21:52.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7438
03:21:52.431 --> 03:21:53.930
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't call me about where you been.</v>

7439
03:21:53.931 --> 03:21:54.550
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

7440
03:21:54.550 --> 03:21:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

7441
03:21:54.950 --> 03:21:55.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7442
03:21:55.160 --> 03:21:56.720
<v Speaker 1>I got to touch the black dog.</v>

7443
03:21:56.990 --> 03:21:57.531
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

7444
03:21:57.531 --> 03:21:58.364
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

7445
03:21:59.090 --> 03:22:02.330
<v Speaker 1>cause you ever want to like kill somebody,</v>

7446
03:22:02.420 --> 03:22:05.030
<v Speaker 1>but you can't get yourself off the couch.</v>

7447
03:22:06.100 --> 03:22:07.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like you to depress.</v>

7448
03:22:07.020 --> 03:22:07.770
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to guess.</v>

7449
03:22:07.770 --> 03:22:08.030
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

7450
03:22:08.030 --> 03:22:08.281
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

7451
03:22:08.281 --> 03:22:10.040
<v Speaker 1>it's like some people have a real thing.</v>

7452
03:22:11.360 --> 03:22:12.250
<v Speaker 1>There's overwhelming,</v>

7453
03:22:12.260 --> 03:22:13.280
<v Speaker 1>there's no denying.</v>

7454
03:22:13.400 --> 03:22:14.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

7455
03:22:14.060 --> 03:22:15.620
<v Speaker 1>but how much can exercise help you?</v>

7456
03:22:15.621 --> 03:22:16.850
<v Speaker 1>How much can dine help you?</v>

7457
03:22:17.050 --> 03:22:17.420
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

7458
03:22:17.420 --> 03:22:18.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a factor.</v>

7459
03:22:18.261 --> 03:22:19.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only factor,</v>

7460
03:22:19.311 --> 03:22:20.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's a factor.</v>

7461
03:22:20.480 --> 03:22:20.900
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

7462
03:22:20.900 --> 03:22:24.330
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of people that don't realize that and they go through life and</v>

7463
03:22:24.480 --> 03:22:25.191
<v Speaker 1>they have these issues.</v>

7464
03:22:25.191 --> 03:22:27.830
<v Speaker 1>And then there's people that have all the exercise and the Diet right.</v>

7465
03:22:27.831 --> 03:22:28.940
<v Speaker 1>And they still depressed,</v>

7466
03:22:29.530 --> 03:22:30.410
<v Speaker 1>still not the answer.</v>

7467
03:22:30.920 --> 03:22:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Like they have so much going for him.</v>

7468
03:22:33.140 --> 03:22:34.130
<v Speaker 1>And then there's head trauma.</v>

7469
03:22:34.370 --> 03:22:34.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7470
03:22:34.820 --> 03:22:36.620
<v Speaker 1>there's always going to be a factor.</v>

7471
03:22:36.800 --> 03:22:41.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a Tbi and CTE and all the different things that that does to your head.</v>

7472
03:22:42.410 --> 03:22:43.370
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt about that.</v>

7473
03:22:43.700 --> 03:22:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Chris Cornell Cause Chris Cornell had such an artistic,</v>

7474
03:22:47.360 --> 03:22:48.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7475
03:22:48.080 --> 03:22:49.400
<v Speaker 1>fully artistic,</v>

7476
03:22:49.450 --> 03:22:54.170
<v Speaker 1>such an he accomplished so much artistically and had a con is his art artistry</v>

7477
03:22:54.200 --> 03:22:58.340
<v Speaker 1>was continuing to flourish and kind of in the middle of that with children and</v>

7478
03:22:58.341 --> 03:23:00.970
<v Speaker 1>so much to live for antianxiety medication.</v>

7479
03:23:01.280 --> 03:23:01.700
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

7480
03:23:01.700 --> 03:23:02.390
<v Speaker 1>he calls taking.</v>

7481
03:23:02.390 --> 03:23:02.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7482
03:23:02.601 --> 03:23:05.840
<v Speaker 1>He called his wife up before he did it and he was slurring his words.</v>

7483
03:23:06.140 --> 03:23:08.000
<v Speaker 1>They think he was on a lot of that stuff.</v>

7484
03:23:08.270 --> 03:23:10.280
<v Speaker 1>How about the Lincoln Park?</v>

7485
03:23:11.480 --> 03:23:12.950
<v Speaker 1>He had seven kids.</v>

7486
03:23:13.340 --> 03:23:15.230
<v Speaker 1>That stuff that he had real depression too,</v>

7487
03:23:15.231 --> 03:23:17.300
<v Speaker 1>and he's essentially was young.</v>

7488
03:23:17.390 --> 03:23:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I was and but anti anxiety medication has various effects on people.</v>

7489
03:23:22.570 --> 03:23:25.460
<v Speaker 1>There's some people it's a godsend for,</v>

7490
03:23:25.760 --> 03:23:27.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's just like the Brazil nuts thing.</v>

7491
03:23:27.440 --> 03:23:30.500
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that going to have an adverse reaction to it and you have to</v>

7492
03:23:30.501 --> 03:23:32.660
<v Speaker 1>be prepared for whatever that reaction could be.</v>

7493
03:23:32.750 --> 03:23:32.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

7494
03:23:32.901 --> 03:23:33.734
<v Speaker 1>that's a good point.</v>

7495
03:23:34.100 --> 03:23:34.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7496
03:23:34.341 --> 03:23:35.570
<v Speaker 1>It's all fucking bummer,</v>

7497
03:23:35.571 --> 03:23:35.871
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

7498
03:23:35.871 --> 03:23:36.510
<v Speaker 1>The human body,</v>

7499
03:23:36.510 --> 03:23:37.490
<v Speaker 1>we don't have it figured out,</v>

7500
03:23:37.491 --> 03:23:38.181
<v Speaker 1>but God damn,</v>

7501
03:23:38.181 --> 03:23:39.220
<v Speaker 1>they're getting closer and closer.</v>

7502
03:23:39.230 --> 03:23:41.570
<v Speaker 1>It goes back to the fact that we're all very complicated.</v>

7503
03:23:41.571 --> 03:23:42.500
<v Speaker 1>We're all individuals.</v>

7504
03:23:42.560 --> 03:23:44.360
<v Speaker 1>So I have a little compassion for each other.</v>

7505
03:23:44.390 --> 03:23:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Have a little compassion,</v>

7506
03:23:45.291 --> 03:23:46.124
<v Speaker 1>would be nice.</v>

7507
03:23:46.280 --> 03:23:48.500
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people lashing out because they don't feel good.</v>

7508
03:23:48.710 --> 03:23:49.580
<v Speaker 1>And I'll watch this lady,</v>

7509
03:23:49.581 --> 03:23:50.990
<v Speaker 1>the other deck cut in front of somebody.</v>

7510
03:23:51.230 --> 03:23:52.280
<v Speaker 1>It was hilarious.</v>

7511
03:23:52.610 --> 03:23:56.840
<v Speaker 1>This guy's trying to get into this lane and this lady speeds up to try to keep</v>

7512
03:23:56.841 --> 03:23:59.120
<v Speaker 1>the guy from getting in the lane and the guy sees it.</v>

7513
03:23:59.121 --> 03:24:02.660
<v Speaker 1>So he just kind of eases over anyway and she just lays on her horn,</v>

7514
03:24:02.900 --> 03:24:03.980
<v Speaker 1>bam.</v>

7515

7516
03:24:06.950 --> 03:24:10.250
<v Speaker 1>he's in his lane now and he pulls up and she gets in the next lane,</v>

7517
03:24:10.430 --> 03:24:11.630
<v Speaker 1>shoots in front of them,</v>

7518

7519
03:24:14.810 --> 03:24:19.460
<v Speaker 1>And so he gets to the left of her and just starts going towards her and she</v>

7520
03:24:19.461 --> 03:24:22.250
<v Speaker 1>freaks out and turns into traffic and has to slam on the breaks.</v>

7521
03:24:22.251 --> 03:24:27.251
<v Speaker 1>Like you just had a crazy hissy fit over nothing cause you did that conti thing</v>

7523
03:24:30.651 --> 03:24:30.950
<v Speaker 1>lane.</v>

03:24:33.230 --> 03:24:34.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like she sped up,</v>

7528
03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:37.760
<v Speaker 1>she sped up to keep it from going in and I saw you watched it all play out and</v>

<v Speaker 1>And she had her golden retriever and she uh,</v>

7537
03:24:54.570 --> 03:24:56.070
<v Speaker 1>dressed in a preppy fashion.</v>

7538
03:24:56.360 --> 03:24:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Slow down.</v>

7539
03:24:57.540 --> 03:24:58.110

03:24:58.110 --> 03:24:58.671
<v Speaker 1>And then I go,</v>

03:24:58.671 --> 03:24:58.920
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

7542
03:24:58.920 --> 03:25:01.810

<v Speaker 1>and I could hear her make that noise.</v>

7544
03:25:03.601 --> 03:25:07.650
<v Speaker 1>She goes like that with her and she gave me the hardest middle finger.</v>

7545
03:25:07.690 --> 03:25:08.161
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

03:25:08.640 --> 03:25:09.960
<v Speaker 1>are you kidding me?</v>

7548
03:25:10.410 --> 03:25:11.101
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

7549
03:25:11.101 --> 03:25:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm calling the police and reached for her phone right away.</v>

7550
03:25:14.040 --> 03:25:14.873
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

7556
03:25:18.451 --> 03:25:19.410
<v Speaker 1>And just kept going.</v>

7557
03:25:19.680 --> 03:25:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I remember getting in a road rage situation with this dude when I first moved to</v>

7558
03:25:22.501 --> 03:25:23.100
<v Speaker 1>La.</v>

7559
03:25:23.100 --> 03:25:26.520
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at each other on the highway and he takes his shirt off to show me</v>

7560
03:25:26.521 --> 03:25:27.354
<v Speaker 1>his tattoo.</v>

7561
03:25:28.200 --> 03:25:30.570
<v Speaker 1>He's screaming at me and I'm not reacting.</v>

7562
03:25:30.580 --> 03:25:31.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm just looking at him.</v>

7563
03:25:31.441 --> 03:25:31.741
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

7564
03:25:31.741 --> 03:25:32.760
<v Speaker 1>what is going to happen here?</v>

7565
03:25:33.090 --> 03:25:33.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

7566
03:25:33.470 --> 03:25:35.790
<v Speaker 1>why is this guy trying so hard to scare me?</v>

7567
03:25:35.791 --> 03:25:36.091
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

7568
03:25:36.091 --> 03:25:37.500
<v Speaker 1>fuck you fucking pull over.</v>

7569

<v Speaker 1>Fucking pull over.</v>

7570
03:25:38.880 --> 03:25:40.020
<v Speaker 1>So he takes his shirt off.</v>

7571
03:25:40.420 --> 03:25:43.260
<v Speaker 1>He's got all these tattoos by the ways it does not look built.</v>

7572
03:25:43.560 --> 03:25:43.921
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

7578
03:25:51.421 --> 03:25:52.050
<v Speaker 1>which is probably,</v>

7579
03:25:52.050 --> 03:25:53.850
<v Speaker 1>he's probably terrified of noise.</v>

7580
03:25:53.870 --> 03:25:54.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7581
03:25:54.150 --> 03:25:56.250

7582
03:25:56.251 --> 03:25:58.920
<v Speaker 1>he just keeps screaming at me because I'm not reacting to them.</v>

7583
03:25:58.921 --> 03:25:59.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>

7584

<v Speaker 1>like looking at him and he's screaming and I'm in my car driving and he's</v>

7585
03:26:02.341 --> 03:26:04.190
<v Speaker 1>looking at me and uh,</v>

7586
03:26:04.260 --> 03:26:05.670

7587
03:26:05.671 --> 03:26:07.530

7595
03:26:16.800 --> 03:26:20.940
<v Speaker 1>It was real screaming and I was thinking at this time I could make a terrible</v>

7596
03:26:20.941 --> 03:26:22.140
<v Speaker 1>mistake while I could tell you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7602
03:26:26.850 --> 03:26:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Which yeah,</v>

7603
03:26:27.781 --> 03:26:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't only like 28 at the time.</v>

7604
03:26:30.541 --> 03:26:32.010
<v Speaker 1>I was still pretty fucking stupid,</v>

7605
03:26:32.730 --> 03:26:36.570
<v Speaker 1>but this guy screaming at me almost maybe realize how dumb it is.</v>

7606
03:26:36.870 --> 03:26:37.231
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

7607
03:26:37.231 --> 03:26:38.610
<v Speaker 1>watch this guy taking his shirt off.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Disaster.</v>

7612
03:26:48.460 --> 03:26:52.110
<v Speaker 1>A best case scenario though,</v>

7613
03:26:52.170 --> 03:26:56.040
<v Speaker 1>I literally think I should have just pulled over and kicked up fucking dude's</v>

7614
03:26:56.041 --> 03:26:57.660
<v Speaker 1>legs out from under them and choke them.</v>

03:27:00.240 --> 03:27:02.940
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for those thoughts 20 years later.</v>

7618
03:27:03.210 --> 03:27:06.330
<v Speaker 1>That's how dumb those instances where you want to go into a lane,</v>

7619
03:27:06.331 --> 03:27:07.190
<v Speaker 1>someone doesn't want to let you in.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They speed up and get fucking Hong Kong.</v>

7621
03:27:08.970 --> 03:27:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you like that tension.</v>

7622
03:27:10.920 --> 03:27:11.641
<v Speaker 1>It's so dumb.</v>

7623
03:27:11.641 --> 03:27:14.160
<v Speaker 1>You'll hold onto some of those dumb thoughts for decades.</v>

7624
03:27:14.160 --> 03:27:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

7627
03:27:17.300 --> 03:27:20.970
<v Speaker 1>I looked at my phone at directions and I was at a stop sign and you know it was</v>

7628

<v Speaker 1>my turn to go,</v>

7629
03:27:21.631 --> 03:27:24.630
<v Speaker 1>but I was looking down at my phone for directions and this guy behind me,</v>

7630
03:27:24.631 --> 03:27:26.130
<v Speaker 1>he's like a regular worker,</v>

7631
03:27:26.131 --> 03:27:26.964
<v Speaker 1>like in a car,</v>

7637
03:27:32.881 --> 03:27:37.881
<v Speaker 1>He goes around me who slams on the brakes and starts flipping off talking shit.</v>

7638
03:27:38.760 --> 03:27:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

03:27:52.271 --> 03:27:52.840
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

7656
03:27:52.840 --> 03:27:54.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna beat up this tab,</v>

7657
03:27:54.820 --> 03:27:56.110
<v Speaker 2>the fuck am I going to do?</v>

7658
03:27:56.170 --> 03:27:58.960
<v Speaker 2>But he's playing a game that he thinks he's safe playing.</v>

7659
03:27:59.030 --> 03:27:59.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

7660
03:27:59.300 --> 03:28:00.820
<v Speaker 2>because we're not in Serbia.</v>

7661
03:28:00.850 --> 03:28:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's pulling guns out and gunning people down the street.</v>

7662
03:28:03.161 --> 03:28:03.760
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

7663
03:28:03.760 --> 03:28:04.420
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>

7664
03:28:04.420 --> 03:28:05.800
<v Speaker 2>they'll do that kind of shit.</v>

7665
03:28:05.860 --> 03:28:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I watched these two guys race each other and they were,</v>

7666
03:28:07.841 --> 03:28:10.840
<v Speaker 2>they were cutting in front of each other and slam on the breaks and doing that</v>

7667
03:28:10.841 --> 03:28:11.021
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

7668
03:28:11.021 --> 03:28:14.740
<v Speaker 2>It's slamming the brakes and yelling shit at each other at the window and just</v>

7669
03:28:14.741 --> 03:28:15.251
<v Speaker 2>watch him.</v>

7670
03:28:15.251 --> 03:28:15.761
<v Speaker 2>And he'd go like,</v>

7671
03:28:15.761 --> 03:28:17.230
<v Speaker 2>this could be nothing.</v>

7672
03:28:17.320 --> 03:28:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Or it could be your life.</v>

7673
03:28:18.701 --> 03:28:19.021
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

7674
03:28:19.021 --> 03:28:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

7675
03:28:19.200 --> 03:28:20.290
<v Speaker 2>you could hit that guy,</v>

7676
03:28:20.291 --> 03:28:21.340
<v Speaker 2>he can go into traffic.</v>

7677
03:28:21.341 --> 03:28:22.300
<v Speaker 2>Somebody could die,</v>

7678
03:28:22.540 --> 03:28:23.800
<v Speaker 2>he could hit someone on the street.</v>

7679
03:28:23.801 --> 03:28:23.921
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

7680
03:28:23.921 --> 03:28:25.030
<v Speaker 2>you guys are speeding.</v>

7681
03:28:25.031 --> 03:28:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Like you're in this death race.</v>

7682
03:28:26.861 --> 03:28:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Like you're in some fucking mad max movie.</v>

7683
03:28:28.780 --> 03:28:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

7684

7685
03:28:30.720 --> 03:28:31.030
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

7686
03:28:31.030 --> 03:28:32.650
<v Speaker 2>he's yelled at me and I'm like,</v>

7687
03:28:32.651 --> 03:28:33.221
<v Speaker 2>what are you gonna do,</v>

7688
03:28:33.221 --> 03:28:33.640
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

7689
03:28:33.640 --> 03:28:34.241
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do?</v>

7690
03:28:34.241 --> 03:28:34.660
<v Speaker 2>You're going to cut.</v>

7691
03:28:34.660 --> 03:28:35.300
<v Speaker 2>You gotta go,</v>

7692
03:28:35.300 --> 03:28:36.820
<v Speaker 2>you gonna fight me with the fucking to do.</v>

7693
03:28:37.030 --> 03:28:37.300
<v Speaker 2>And he's,</v>

7694
03:28:37.300 --> 03:28:37.750
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

7695
03:28:37.750 --> 03:28:38.021
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

7696
03:28:38.021 --> 03:28:38.740
<v Speaker 2>that's a big deck.</v>

7697
03:28:38.740 --> 03:28:39.573
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

7698
03:28:39.660 --> 03:28:40.493
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

7699
03:28:42.430 --> 03:28:43.810
<v Speaker 2>I took off my glasses on.</v>

7700
03:28:43.811 --> 03:28:43.961
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

7701
03:28:43.961 --> 03:28:45.220
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking serious.</v>

7702
03:28:45.250 --> 03:28:46.480
<v Speaker 2>You're serious right now.</v>

7703
03:28:46.820 --> 03:28:47.141
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

7704
03:28:47.141 --> 03:28:47.951
<v Speaker 2>oh it keeps going.</v>

7705
03:28:47.951 --> 03:28:48.784
<v Speaker 2>And then I thought,</v>

7706
03:28:48.880 --> 03:28:51.570
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to get out and get shot and fight this guy,</v>

7707
03:28:52.110 --> 03:28:56.380
<v Speaker 2>he has a gun and I was wanting to go left by coming cause he's blocked me.</v>

7708
03:28:56.470 --> 03:28:57.460
<v Speaker 2>So I went right.</v>

7709
03:28:57.820 --> 03:28:58.211
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

7710
03:28:58.211 --> 03:28:58.451
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

7711
03:28:58.451 --> 03:28:59.250
<v Speaker 2>my brother and my,</v>

7712
03:28:59.250 --> 03:29:01.480
<v Speaker 2>and my friends will make fun of me for going right when I show went,</v>

7713
03:29:01.750 --> 03:29:03.160
<v Speaker 2>but it's the right thing to do.</v>

7714
03:29:03.220 --> 03:29:04.480
<v Speaker 2>So right there I'm like,</v>

7715
03:29:04.481 --> 03:29:05.081
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to do?</v>

7716
03:29:05.081 --> 03:29:05.914
<v Speaker 2>Fight this fucking guy.</v>

7717
03:29:05.920 --> 03:29:07.120
<v Speaker 2>Think of that as being like,</v>

7718
03:29:07.121 --> 03:29:08.110
<v Speaker 2>you're running to a dog.</v>

7719
03:29:08.990 --> 03:29:09.970
<v Speaker 2>Are you supposed to like,</v>

7720
03:29:09.971 --> 03:29:11.200
<v Speaker 2>hey fuck you dog.</v>

7721
03:29:11.260 --> 03:29:11.441
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

7722
03:29:11.441 --> 03:29:12.041
<v Speaker 2>you sit,</v>

7723
03:29:12.041 --> 03:29:12.550
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

7724
03:29:12.550 --> 03:29:13.720
<v Speaker 2>Sit and supposed to go.</v>

7725
03:29:13.870 --> 03:29:14.703
<v Speaker 2>I got to go.</v>

7726
03:29:14.740 --> 03:29:16.390
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is it's a person.</v>

7727
03:29:16.420 --> 03:29:18.520
<v Speaker 2>So a person you think of is different than a dog.</v>

7728
03:29:18.710 --> 03:29:21.010
<v Speaker 2>Dog is not going to get the fuck away from that dog.</v>

7729
03:29:21.220 --> 03:29:21.371
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7730
03:29:21.371 --> 03:29:22.810
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck away from that person too.</v>

7731
03:29:22.860 --> 03:29:24.850
<v Speaker 2>It's the ego thing to listen.</v>

7732
03:29:24.851 --> 03:29:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

7733
03:29:25.170 --> 03:29:28.750
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have that 9.9% of the fucking human beings you're going to interact</v>

7734
03:29:28.751 --> 03:29:28.931
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

7735
03:29:28.931 --> 03:29:31.960
<v Speaker 2>You could kill that should play heavy on your mind.</v>

7736
03:29:31.960 --> 03:29:34.150
<v Speaker 2>Know that you know I played on my mind was I went,</v>

7737
03:29:34.180 --> 03:29:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I bet he's going through some shit.</v>

7738
03:29:36.040 --> 03:29:37.720
<v Speaker 2>He probably went like a double shift.</v>

7739
03:29:38.410 --> 03:29:41.480
<v Speaker 2>Someone probably was texting before me and he,</v>

7740
03:29:41.740 --> 03:29:43.150
<v Speaker 2>he's just taking his anger out on me.</v>

7741
03:29:43.151 --> 03:29:44.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to go right.</v>

7742
03:29:44.021 --> 03:29:44.711
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this man.</v>

7743
03:29:44.711 --> 03:29:45.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't need this.</v>

7744
03:29:45.370 --> 03:29:45.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7745
03:29:45.700 --> 03:29:48.400
<v Speaker 2>but he could have been 10 you know,</v>

7746
03:29:48.460 --> 03:29:53.260
<v Speaker 2>and still acted like that and you should have the same reaction like,</v>

7747
03:29:53.290 --> 03:29:54.123
<v Speaker 2>oh God.</v>

7748
03:29:54.130 --> 03:29:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Like it's a child time.</v>

7749
03:29:55.960 --> 03:29:56.531
<v Speaker 2>He's a child.</v>

7750
03:29:56.531 --> 03:29:57.480
<v Speaker 2>He's a grownup baby.</v>

7751
03:29:57.490 --> 03:29:58.191
<v Speaker 2>When he cut me off,</v>

7752
03:29:58.191 --> 03:29:59.440
<v Speaker 2>the enemy's going to kick your ass.</v>

7753
03:29:59.470 --> 03:29:59.771
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

7754
03:29:59.771 --> 03:30:00.080
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

7755
03:30:00.080 --> 03:30:00.580
<v Speaker 2>crap,</v>

7756
03:30:00.580 --> 03:30:01.420
<v Speaker 2>I want to two things,</v>

7757
03:30:01.421 --> 03:30:03.520
<v Speaker 2>either as a gun or he's fucking insane.</v>

7758
03:30:03.700 --> 03:30:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Those are the only two possibilities.</v>

7759
03:30:04.921 --> 03:30:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

7760
03:30:05.530 --> 03:30:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

7761
03:30:05.920 --> 03:30:08.870
<v Speaker 2>Or he doesn't realize your gorilla sitting in your car.</v>

7762
03:30:08.871 --> 03:30:11.030
<v Speaker 2>You look like a normal size personal orange portion.</v>

7763
03:30:11.650 --> 03:30:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this warmup.</v>

7764
03:30:13.210 --> 03:30:13.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

7765
03:30:13.421 --> 03:30:16.260
<v Speaker 2>He probably feels like you're some preppy dickhead bel air.</v>

7766
03:30:16.780 --> 03:30:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Some Cutie Pie.</v>

7767
03:30:18.041 --> 03:30:18.874
<v Speaker 2>And be right.</v>

7768
03:30:20.900 --> 03:30:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Was talking about like road rage incidents,</v>

7769
03:30:23.530 --> 03:30:23.771
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

7770
03:30:23.771 --> 03:30:25.960
<v Speaker 2>they've figured out why people have road rage too.</v>

7771
03:30:26.170 --> 03:30:28.270
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons why to curse so often,</v>

7772
03:30:28.271 --> 03:30:31.300
<v Speaker 2>it's not just a separation by barriers between you and the other person.</v>

7773
03:30:31.301 --> 03:30:32.380
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have social cues.</v>

7774
03:30:32.620 --> 03:30:37.120
<v Speaker 2>It's also that your senses are jacked up because you're in the situation where</v>

7775
03:30:37.121 --> 03:30:40.010
<v Speaker 2>you know that you have to react potentially</v>

7776
03:30:40.190 --> 03:30:42.020
<v Speaker 3>at a very fast rate.</v>

7777
03:30:42.320 --> 03:30:45.290
<v Speaker 3>You have to be able to react instantaneously to someone changed the only slam on</v>

7778
03:30:45.291 --> 03:30:45.590
<v Speaker 3>the breaks.</v>

7779
03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

7780
03:30:45.800 --> 03:30:49.820
<v Speaker 3>Got gotta be so you're at heightened states and so then you interact with people</v>

7781
03:30:49.821 --> 03:30:52.550
<v Speaker 3>that you think maybe are fucking with that heightened state and he doesn't want</v>

7782
03:30:52.551 --> 03:30:55.400
<v Speaker 3>to lay on that horn you piece of shit to cut me off.</v>

7783
03:30:55.401 --> 03:30:56.570
<v Speaker 3>And you and everybody,</v>

7784
03:30:56.600 --> 03:30:57.560
<v Speaker 3>everybody's been guilty of it.</v>

7785
03:30:57.561 --> 03:31:00.110
<v Speaker 3>And everybody has to learn to negotiate those,</v>

7786
03:31:00.111 --> 03:31:00.944
<v Speaker 3>that weird,</v>

7787
03:31:01.070 --> 03:31:01.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

7788
03:31:01.590 --> 03:31:06.050
<v Speaker 3>extra urge of aggression that you get when you're in your car and don't,</v>

7789
03:31:06.051 --> 03:31:07.580
<v Speaker 3>don't get out of the car and fight.</v>

7790
03:31:07.581 --> 03:31:08.270
<v Speaker 3>Don't do it.</v>

7791
03:31:08.270 --> 03:31:08.511
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

7792
03:31:08.511 --> 03:31:08.871
<v Speaker 3>don't do it.</v>

7793
03:31:08.871 --> 03:31:09.860
<v Speaker 3>But people want to do it,</v>

7794
03:31:09.861 --> 03:31:10.190
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

7795
03:31:10.190 --> 03:31:11.390
<v Speaker 3>They want to do it all the time.</v>

7796
03:31:12.190 --> 03:31:12.950
<v Speaker 3>No bad idea.</v>

7797
03:31:12.950 --> 03:31:13.431
<v Speaker 3>People shoot,</v>

7798
03:31:13.431 --> 03:31:17.300
<v Speaker 3>people look at your head and you've got to kind of a big head.</v>

7799
03:31:17.360 --> 03:31:18.590
<v Speaker 3>Now you've got a friendly faith man.</v>

7800
03:31:18.590 --> 03:31:19.970
<v Speaker 3>What about your ears like I did,</v>

7801
03:31:22.070 --> 03:31:22.540
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

7802
03:31:22.540 --> 03:31:23.960
<v Speaker 3>this bullshit haircut.</v>

7803
03:31:23.961 --> 03:31:25.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a orange Porsche.</v>

7804
03:31:25.490 --> 03:31:27.770
<v Speaker 3>I probably got skinny jeans on so when I get,</v>

7805
03:31:27.771 --> 03:31:28.640
<v Speaker 3>I get the binding.</v>

7806
03:31:28.641 --> 03:31:29.181
<v Speaker 3>Anyone,</v>

7807
03:31:29.181 --> 03:31:30.280
<v Speaker 3>he's not thinking of finding it.</v>

7808
03:31:30.281 --> 03:31:31.760
<v Speaker 3>It's all opposing thing.</v>

7809
03:31:31.761 --> 03:31:32.330
<v Speaker 3>It's all,</v>

7810
03:31:32.330 --> 03:31:33.710
<v Speaker 3>it's all a bluff charge.</v>

7811
03:31:33.890 --> 03:31:34.850
<v Speaker 3>It's all bluff charge.</v>

7812
03:31:34.851 --> 03:31:37.520
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what it it all the way he cut me off though.</v>

7813
03:31:37.521 --> 03:31:38.450
<v Speaker 3>This guy was down.</v>

7814
03:31:38.510 --> 03:31:38.730
<v Speaker 3>She had,</v>

7815
03:31:38.730 --> 03:31:39.650
<v Speaker 3>but he's not down.</v>

7816
03:31:39.651 --> 03:31:41.930
<v Speaker 3>It's like a like a gorilla running up to you.</v>

7817
03:31:41.931 --> 03:31:43.750
<v Speaker 3>It was never planning on smashing it.</v>

7818
03:31:43.850 --> 03:31:44.541
<v Speaker 3>The shit worked.</v>

7819
03:31:44.541 --> 03:31:45.374
<v Speaker 3>I went right,</v>

7820
03:31:45.500 --> 03:31:46.270
<v Speaker 3>go left,</v>

7821
03:31:46.270 --> 03:31:47.091
<v Speaker 3>go all the way around.</v>

7822
03:31:47.091 --> 03:31:47.990
<v Speaker 3>He went home.</v>

7823
03:31:47.991 --> 03:31:49.100
<v Speaker 3>His Dick was hard as a rock.</v>

7824
03:31:49.140 --> 03:31:50.420
<v Speaker 3>He fucked the shit out of his wife.</v>

7825
03:31:50.760 --> 03:31:51.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fucking man.</v>

7826
03:31:51.740 --> 03:31:54.600
<v Speaker 3>It was a guy cut me off and I told him to fuck off or you want to fight your</v>

7827
03:31:54.610 --> 03:31:55.310
<v Speaker 3>mother fucker?</v>

7828
03:31:55.310 --> 03:31:56.091
<v Speaker 3>He said no,</v>

7829
03:31:56.091 --> 03:31:56.890
<v Speaker 3>and I'm going to fuck you.</v>

7830
03:31:56.890 --> 03:31:57.723
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

7831
03:31:58.700 --> 03:31:59.650
<v Speaker 3>they say they say that.</v>

7832
03:31:59.820 --> 03:32:04.070
<v Speaker 3>And what was that book by Malcolm Gladwell wearing wherever you're from,</v>

7833
03:32:04.560 --> 03:32:04.910
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

7834
03:32:04.910 --> 03:32:08.180
<v Speaker 3>has to do with how you react to a fronts.</v>

7835
03:32:08.210 --> 03:32:13.210
<v Speaker 3>So like they did this experiment where they would have a Guy Bay,</v>

7836
03:32:14.180 --> 03:32:17.960
<v Speaker 3>they'd have you take two fake tests and you had to take a test in this room and</v>

7837
03:32:17.961 --> 03:32:20.030
<v Speaker 3>then you had to go down the hall and take a test in another room.</v>

7838
03:32:20.270 --> 03:32:23.390
<v Speaker 3>As you are walking down the hall together test you would get,</v>

7839
03:32:23.450 --> 03:32:24.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

7840
03:32:24.080 --> 03:32:25.130
<v Speaker 3>somebody would walk by you,</v>

7841
03:32:25.140 --> 03:32:28.730
<v Speaker 3>bump you and go watch out ass hole and keep walking.</v>

7842
03:32:29.510 --> 03:32:33.980
<v Speaker 3>And the dude's from the south versus the guys from the north.</v>

7843
03:32:34.280 --> 03:32:35.300
<v Speaker 3>The dude's from the south,</v>

7844
03:32:35.301 --> 03:32:36.590
<v Speaker 3>there's Sarah Tall level,</v>

7845
03:32:36.591 --> 03:32:36.921
<v Speaker 3>whatever the,</v>

7846
03:32:36.921 --> 03:32:37.820
<v Speaker 3>all those levels.</v>

7847
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:39.770
<v Speaker 3>There's Sarah told levels,</v>

7848
03:32:39.771 --> 03:32:40.910
<v Speaker 3>their testosterone levels,</v>

7849
03:32:40.911 --> 03:32:43.190
<v Speaker 3>everything was Jack to the fucking roof.</v>

7850
03:32:43.430 --> 03:32:44.960
<v Speaker 3>They were ready to fight dude.</v>

7851
03:32:44.961 --> 03:32:45.794
<v Speaker 3>Some in north,</v>

7852
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:46.400
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

7853
03:32:46.400 --> 03:32:47.150
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>

7854
03:32:47.150 --> 03:32:47.630
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

7855
03:32:47.630 --> 03:32:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Huh,</v>

7856
03:32:48.050 --> 03:32:48.620
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

7857
03:32:48.620 --> 03:32:49.453
<v Speaker 3>What a Dick.</v>

7858
03:32:49.790 --> 03:32:54.790
<v Speaker 3>And it had to do according to global and not really also this guy in this bit as</v>

7859
03:32:54.951 --> 03:32:55.784
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

7860
03:32:55.790 --> 03:32:58.010
<v Speaker 3>It had to do with where you are from.</v>

7861
03:32:58.040 --> 03:32:59.210
<v Speaker 3>And more importantly,</v>

7862
03:32:59.211 --> 03:33:01.400
<v Speaker 3>where your ancestry heralded from.</v>

7863
03:33:01.430 --> 03:33:06.430
<v Speaker 3>If you came from a culture and honor culture as opposed to a,</v>

7864
03:33:07.281 --> 03:33:08.960
<v Speaker 3>what they call the dignity culture.</v>

7865
03:33:08.961 --> 03:33:12.470
<v Speaker 3>So if you came from a culture where honor was everything,</v>

7866
03:33:12.471 --> 03:33:14.510
<v Speaker 3>and those cultures are hurting cultures,</v>

7867
03:33:14.780 --> 03:33:16.050
<v Speaker 3>that's where you get the Chinese.</v>

7868
03:33:16.060 --> 03:33:17.160
<v Speaker 3>That's where you get the Afghanis.</v>

7869
03:33:17.180 --> 03:33:19.160
<v Speaker 3>That's where you get the North Scots,</v>

7870
03:33:19.190 --> 03:33:20.023
<v Speaker 3>Irish.</v>

7871
03:33:20.210 --> 03:33:21.440
<v Speaker 3>That's why Armenians,</v>

7872
03:33:21.710 --> 03:33:22.410
<v Speaker 3>Armenians,</v>

7873
03:33:22.410 --> 03:33:23.720
<v Speaker 3>wines will fuck you up.</v>

7874
03:33:23.760 --> 03:33:24.593
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

7875
03:33:24.920 --> 03:33:26.480
<v Speaker 3>Armenians are tough shit.</v>

7876
03:33:26.600 --> 03:33:27.331
<v Speaker 3>Shoulder checks.</v>

7877
03:33:27.331 --> 03:33:28.670
<v Speaker 3>I'm Armenian in the street.</v>

7878
03:33:29.900 --> 03:33:30.920
<v Speaker 3>They will punch you in the,</v>

7879
03:33:31.000 --> 03:33:32.000
<v Speaker 3>they don't fuck around.</v>

7880
03:33:32.030 --> 03:33:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Our meeting yourself was scrapped and tight knit communities.</v>

7881
03:33:35.450 --> 03:33:36.200
<v Speaker 3>I like that.</v>

7882
03:33:36.200 --> 03:33:36.471
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

7883
03:33:36.471 --> 03:33:36.770
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

7884
03:33:36.770 --> 03:33:37.590
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

7885
03:33:37.590 --> 03:33:42.360
<v Speaker 3>it was from honor cultures and the Scots Irish who settled where the</v>

7886
03:33:42.361 --> 03:33:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Appalachians,</v>

7887
03:33:43.690 --> 03:33:44.160
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

7888
03:33:44.160 --> 03:33:44.510
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

7889
03:33:44.510 --> 03:33:46.170
<v Speaker 3>the Hatfields and McCoys</v>

7890
03:33:48.060 --> 03:33:48.661
<v Speaker 3>the fuck.</v>

7891
03:33:48.661 --> 03:33:49.494
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

7892
03:33:49.710 --> 03:33:51.000
<v Speaker 3>When you go to Ireland,</v>

7893
03:33:51.030 --> 03:33:53.250
<v Speaker 3>you go to parts of the UK,</v>

7894
03:33:53.520 --> 03:33:54.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

7895
03:33:54.180 --> 03:33:55.770
<v Speaker 3>in the north where Tony's from,</v>

7896
03:33:55.890 --> 03:33:56.491
<v Speaker 3>good luck.</v>

7897
03:33:56.491 --> 03:33:57.720
<v Speaker 3>Go see what happens in a bar.</v>

7898
03:33:57.721 --> 03:33:59.160
<v Speaker 3>When you want to get scrappy,</v>

7899
03:33:59.190 --> 03:33:59.491
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>

7900
03:33:59.491 --> 03:34:02.280
<v Speaker 3>you'll find plenty of men to meet you halfway.</v>

7901
03:34:02.760 --> 03:34:07.170
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if you go to certain other parts of the world where they didn't come</v>

7902
03:34:07.171 --> 03:34:08.700
<v Speaker 3>from hurting cultures,</v>

7903
03:34:08.701 --> 03:34:10.950
<v Speaker 3>where they came from a culture that,</v>

7904
03:34:10.980 --> 03:34:11.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

7905
03:34:11.340 --> 03:34:15.390
<v Speaker 3>relied mostly on agriculture where it relied on cooperation,</v>

7906
03:34:15.600 --> 03:34:16.231
<v Speaker 3>where it see,</v>

7907
03:34:16.231 --> 03:34:19.410
<v Speaker 3>cause when you're a herder and somebody steals your sheep,</v>

7908
03:34:20.310 --> 03:34:22.080
<v Speaker 3>you will not survive the winter.</v>

7909
03:34:22.350 --> 03:34:25.590
<v Speaker 3>So you've got to let everybody know that if you do steal my sheep,</v>

7910
03:34:25.620 --> 03:34:29.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to kill you and every man in your fucking family because I'm a crazy</v>

7911
03:34:29.641 --> 03:34:30.270
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>

7912
03:34:30.270 --> 03:34:30.930
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

7913
03:34:30.930 --> 03:34:31.651
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

7914
03:34:31.651 --> 03:34:31.950
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

7915
03:34:31.950 --> 03:34:33.180
<v Speaker 3>it's do or die here,</v>

7916
03:34:33.600 --> 03:34:34.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

7917
03:34:34.020 --> 03:34:35.850
<v Speaker 3>It's literally survival of your family.</v>

7918
03:34:35.880 --> 03:34:36.930
<v Speaker 3>Nisbett and,</v>

7919
03:34:36.931 --> 03:34:37.640
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

7920
03:34:37.640 --> 03:34:39.660
<v Speaker 3>the Gladwell did and he just wrote a book about it.</v>

7921
03:34:39.661 --> 03:34:42.720
<v Speaker 3>But like some of these guys who actually did the primary research on that proof</v>

7922
03:34:42.900 --> 03:34:43.920
<v Speaker 3>that culture,</v>

7923
03:34:44.160 --> 03:34:46.140
<v Speaker 3>even though you don't know those people,</v>

7924
03:34:46.141 --> 03:34:47.490
<v Speaker 3>even though your generations,</v>

7925
03:34:47.550 --> 03:34:47.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

7926
03:34:47.851 --> 03:34:49.410
<v Speaker 3>removed from that in this country,</v>

7927
03:34:49.650 --> 03:34:51.390
<v Speaker 3>that shit has deep,</v>

7928
03:34:51.540 --> 03:34:53.910
<v Speaker 3>deep roots in your cultural psyche.</v>

7929
03:34:54.160 --> 03:34:54.691
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

7930
03:34:54.691 --> 03:34:58.050
<v Speaker 3>and of course also a form of genetic memory,</v>

7931
03:34:58.470 --> 03:34:59.161
<v Speaker 3>genetic memory,</v>

7932
03:34:59.161 --> 03:35:00.660
<v Speaker 3>but also cultural memory also,</v>

7933
03:35:00.661 --> 03:35:01.020
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

7934
03:35:01.020 --> 03:35:03.600
<v Speaker 3>you're raised as a man to,</v>

7935
03:35:03.690 --> 03:35:05.820
<v Speaker 3>to protect your cubic space.</v>

7936
03:35:06.280 --> 03:35:07.071
<v Speaker 3>Who had to fight me.</v>

7937
03:35:07.071 --> 03:35:08.100
<v Speaker 3>He was with a herder.</v>

7938
03:35:08.490 --> 03:35:09.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he was.</v>

7939

7990
03:36:25.441 --> 03:36:26.490
<v Speaker 3>You fight or twists.</v>

7991
03:36:26.491 --> 03:36:27.510

<v Speaker 3>goes to prison.</v>

7994
03:36:29.830 --> 03:36:30.840
<v Speaker 3>This is not a good move.</v>

7995
03:36:30.870 --> 03:36:32.210
<v Speaker 3>It's show time as he shows.</v>

7996
03:36:32.920 --> 03:36:33.753
<v Speaker 3>No sign.</v>

7997
03:36:34.260 --> 03:36:35.093
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing funny.</v>

7998
03:36:35.580 --> 03:36:35.980
<v Speaker 3>A guy</v>

7999
03:36:35.980 --> 03:36:36.813
<v Speaker 1>beating up another guy.</v>

8000
03:36:37.030 --> 03:36:37.331
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

8001
03:36:37.331 --> 03:36:38.380
<v Speaker 1>there's no upside to it.</v>

8002
03:36:38.381 --> 03:36:40.060
<v Speaker 1>And it's also you can avoid it.</v>

8003
03:36:40.180 --> 03:36:40.540
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

8004
03:36:40.540 --> 03:36:44.010
<v Speaker 1>It can be avoided and pause,</v>

8005
03:36:44.020 --> 03:36:44.681
<v Speaker 1>posturing,</v>

8006
03:36:44.681 --> 03:36:47.380
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and screaming comes from not being able to fight.</v>

8007
03:36:47.410 --> 03:36:48.280
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

8008
03:36:48.310 --> 03:36:51.100
<v Speaker 1>If you could have a like a bar filled with Jujitsu,</v>

8009
03:36:51.101 --> 03:36:51.701
<v Speaker 1>black pilots,</v>

8010
03:36:51.701 --> 03:36:53.650
<v Speaker 1>probably the friendliest fucking bar ever.</v>

8011
03:36:53.690 --> 03:36:54.371
<v Speaker 1>You're the tough guys.</v>

8012
03:36:54.371 --> 03:36:54.581
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

8013
03:36:54.581 --> 03:36:57.880
<v Speaker 1>it's like gun culture because I interviewed a hangout with a bunch of gun guys</v>

8014
03:36:57.881 --> 03:36:58.120
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

8015
03:36:58.120 --> 03:37:02.770
<v Speaker 1>They're super formal and respectful because they're used to seeing bullets</v>

8016
03:37:02.771 --> 03:37:03.371
<v Speaker 1>flying around.</v>

8017
03:37:03.371 --> 03:37:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got to mind their p's and q's when everybody's actually equal.</v>

8018
03:37:06.590 --> 03:37:08.950
<v Speaker 1>If you're a bunch of gun handlers and all of you,</v>

8019
03:37:08.951 --> 03:37:11.500
<v Speaker 1>you're going to gun competitions and shit and you shoot and plink plink,</v>

8020

<v Speaker 1>plink plink roll in and like fucking Keanu Reeves and shit.</v>

8021
03:37:15.340 --> 03:37:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Those guys,</v>

8022
03:37:16.210 --> 03:37:17.043
<v Speaker 1>you know that's an,</v>

8023
03:37:17.450 --> 03:37:19.540
<v Speaker 1>there are equal to everybody in the world.</v>

8024
03:37:19.570 --> 03:37:20.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll have to do is this,</v>

8025
03:37:20.621 --> 03:37:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've,</v>

8026
03:37:21.020 --> 03:37:23.800
<v Speaker 1>they bounce it out to a squeeze of a trigger and seal team.</v>

8027
03:37:23.801 --> 03:37:25.570
<v Speaker 1>We say arms aren't walking around going,</v>

8028
03:37:25.571 --> 03:37:26.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the seals.</v>

8029
03:37:26.531 --> 03:37:27.071

<v Speaker 1>I want to get to the front of the line.</v>

8032
03:37:29.020 --> 03:37:29.651

8033
03:37:29.651 --> 03:37:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8034
03:37:30.340 --> 03:37:33.130
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of marines that came to the common story of the night.</v>

8035
03:37:33.220 --> 03:37:33.941
<v Speaker 1>Real nice guys.</v>

8037
03:37:35.680 --> 03:37:36.371
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with them,</v>

8038
03:37:36.371 --> 03:37:37.210
<v Speaker 1>talking to them afterwards,</v>

8039
03:37:37.570 --> 03:37:40.960
<v Speaker 1>and then there's some weird drunk guy comes up to me after the marines left and</v>

8040
03:37:40.961 --> 03:37:42.580
<v Speaker 1>he asked me about recon marines.</v>

8041
03:37:42.840 --> 03:37:43.300
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

8042
03:37:43.300 --> 03:37:43.661
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It just fluid.</v>

8049
03:37:51.160 --> 03:37:52.100
