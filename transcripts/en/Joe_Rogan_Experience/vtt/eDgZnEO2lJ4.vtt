WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:00.630
<v Speaker 1>We smoke weed,</v>

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 2>we're elaborating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked should we smoke weed right when </v>

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.560
<v Speaker 2>Jamie gave me the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.600
<v Speaker 2>the gun sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's up,</v>

5
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:11.320
<v Speaker 2>brother?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good to see you,</v>

6
00:00:11.321 --> 00:00:11.830
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

7
00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:12.460
<v Speaker 2>you too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

8
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.380
<v Speaker 2>It's good to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good to be back.</v>

9
00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 2>It's good to have you back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 2>This is warm time though in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you didn't really want to leave </v>

11
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what,</v>

12
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.970
<v Speaker 2>but I kind of felt like today out here </v>
<v Speaker 2>was almost the perfect weather anyways.</v>

13
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Like not too oftentimes I'll come out </v>
<v Speaker 2>here like I'm not a guy who needs to be </v>

14
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.760
<v Speaker 2>in the heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

15
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm not one of these people when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>snows or whatever.</v>

16
00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:38.911
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm complaining I can handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like genetically I'm built for </v>

17
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:39.490
<v Speaker 2>that environment where you're a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadian.</v>

18
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.070
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadian born and bred.</v>

19
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.680
<v Speaker 2>They can deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

20
00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

21
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind.</v>

22
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind a little bit of the little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of the cold,</v>

23
00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:51.010
<v Speaker 2>but today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in La,</v>

24
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.560
<v Speaker 2>this is God's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether this is like,</v>

25
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 2>I think if every day could be exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this out here,</v>

26
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.100
<v Speaker 2>there'd be a compelling argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's those hot days getting into the</v>

27
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:02.420
<v Speaker 2>car and burning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I?</v>

28
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.180
<v Speaker 2>Am I fired up today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I fired up?</v>

29
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.670
<v Speaker 2>This is coffee number three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

30
00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Blame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blame the caffeine.</v>

31
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Did the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's two arguments,</v>

32
00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:14.161
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the argument is if it's really </v>

33
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:16.921
<v Speaker 2>cold out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can always dress for the cold when </v>

34
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:16.921
<v Speaker 2>you can't really dress for the warm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

35
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:17.860
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Undressed,</v>

36
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.320
<v Speaker 2>but you could freeze to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's super hard to heat up to death.</v>

37
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.090
<v Speaker 2>Really fuck up to heat up to the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the desert,</v>

38
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.220
<v Speaker 2>the desert and kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty good to go to death valley.</v>

39
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually no dude that died like that.</v>

40
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

41
00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:37.600
<v Speaker 2>He went on like a sort of a spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 2>walk about and kind of a thing.</v>

42
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.180
<v Speaker 2>This Guy Evan Tanner who was a UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter,</v>

43
00:01:40.181 --> 00:01:42.640
<v Speaker 2>former middleweight champion to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that.</v>

44
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was into,</v>

45
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

46
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these long periods of solitude and </v>

47
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.060
<v Speaker 2>spiritual quests and he decided to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>out into the desert and,</v>

48
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just try to find himself or whatever.</v>

49
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what his purpose </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

50
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.390
<v Speaker 2>but when you get out there and it gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>to like 120 130 degrees,</v>

51
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get disoriented and he couldn't </v>

52
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 2>figure out where he put his water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

53
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't find where his stuff was.</v>

54
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 2>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that stuff in movies and </v>

55
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 2>whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cartoons,</v>

56
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.820
<v Speaker 2>where every time somebody is in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>desert,</v>

57
00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:18.790
<v Speaker 2>they're seeing a mirage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that about?</v>

58
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can definitely hallucinate before </v>

59
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 2>you die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do you think that that's what that's</v>

60
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 2>predicated on is an actual history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people having seen these oasis </v>

61
00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.260
<v Speaker 2>situations?</v>

62
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what it is.</v>

63
00:02:30.401 --> 00:02:34.720
<v Speaker 2>You know how when you're driving on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>road and the road is really hot,</v>

64
00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:38.440
<v Speaker 2>it looks like it's wet and it looks like</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's water on the road right from the</v>

65
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.670
<v Speaker 2>heatwave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

66
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.030
<v Speaker 2>That illusion on the road can recreate </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

67
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure in desert situations and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>only makes sense.</v>

68
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's what you want to see.</v>

69
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.600
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

70
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.710
<v Speaker 2>you're in rough shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You create what you need to see.</v>

71
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 2>Can you manage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you did your manager,</v>

72
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:56.830
<v Speaker 2>if you like almost dying and you find </v>
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>

73
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 2>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

74
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the kinds of moments that make</v>

75
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:08.131
<v Speaker 3>people really truly appreciate life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's one of the reasons </v>

76
00:03:08.131 --> 00:03:11.131
<v Speaker 3>why people in la are so fucking spoiled </v>
<v Speaker 3>and ridiculous is because they don't </v>

77
00:03:11.131 --> 00:03:15.721
<v Speaker 3>experience real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether it gets a little warm and then </v>

78
00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 3>the worst thing they have to do is turn </v>
<v Speaker 3>the AC on,</v>

79
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 3>but they don't have to shovel their way </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of snow.</v>

80
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 3>They don't have to drive on slippery </v>
<v Speaker 3>roads,</v>

81
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.790
<v Speaker 3>they don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a certain amount of </v>

82
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.741
<v Speaker 3>community that comes with everybody sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of bonding together because it's a </v>

83
00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:28.741
<v Speaker 3>blizzard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

84
00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 3>You remember those?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

85
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need experienced them all the time.</v>

86
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a is the kind of situation </v>

87
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.940
<v Speaker 3>I think where any time as a human being </v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of you have,</v>

88
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 3>you lose a little bit of control over a </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

89
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the weather or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

90
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 3>You kind of take yourself outside of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that realm of,</v>

91
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 3>of how we like to compartmentalize </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

92
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 3>We'd like to like the epitome of self </v>
<v Speaker 3>centeredness is being in control of </v>

93
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.531
<v Speaker 3>absolutely every experience you have and</v>
<v Speaker 3>never letting go and the rest of the </v>

94
00:03:58.531 --> 00:03:58.710
<v Speaker 3>world around you as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

95
00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.940
<v Speaker 3>Just your experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

96
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You try to control kind of situation and</v>

97
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 3>choosing to live in a place where where </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

98
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:12.421
<v Speaker 3>shit can go wrong or or you can have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>snow storm or whatever is a.</v>

99
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.750
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of an element in that is he </v>

100
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.241
<v Speaker 3>says it's an aspect of losing control </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the space and so what ends up </v>

101
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:22.450
<v Speaker 3>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got people slip sliding around.</v>

102
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:27.451
<v Speaker 3>You've got a essentially people coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the realization that the planet can </v>

103
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.580
<v Speaker 3>come kick the shit out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it wants to know.</v>

104
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 3>I guess an earthquake would work that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

105
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.330
<v Speaker 3>Earthquakes do work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

106
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 3>even a horrible thing like nine slash 11</v>
<v Speaker 3>works that way.</v>

107
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.710
<v Speaker 3>It did when I was in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we filmed fear factor in New York like </v>

108
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 3>less than a year I think after nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>slash 11.</v>

109
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:48.910
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty close to when it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Man,</v>

110
00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 3>it was just such a different vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was so friendly.</v>

111
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.850
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was so friendly and so nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

112
00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend who a blacked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were all hanging out in front of this</v>

113
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.370
<v Speaker 3>bar and we stepped outside and a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>of them smoke cigarettes and uh,</v>

114
00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 3>I pulled out a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

115
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:08.960
<v Speaker 3>who wants to get down with this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the.</v>

116
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh good,</v>

117
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.390
<v Speaker 3>let's go there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like these producers like agreeably,</v>

118
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.490
<v Speaker 3>we're doing this right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

119
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.650
<v Speaker 3>One of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess she just doesn't smoke pot or </v>

120
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.650
<v Speaker 3>she just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>

121
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 3>she took a hit and then you see like her</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes rolled behind her head and her legs</v>

122
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 3>go down and she almost fell like we had </v>
<v Speaker 3>a catcher passed out.</v>

123
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She blacked out from weed.</v>

124
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think it was the weed or it was </v>

125
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.321
<v Speaker 3>just in conjunction with kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>drama of the whole event having </v>

126
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:38.321
<v Speaker 3>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

127
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:43.290
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was definitely the weed because she </v>

128
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.350
<v Speaker 3>was from La and we flew into film fear </v>
<v Speaker 3>factor there and she just.</v>

129
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

130
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.590
<v Speaker 3>I just had a weird reaction to pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was,</v>

131
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 3>fucking space we need to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

132
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 3>so we called the first responders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

133
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:55.570
<v Speaker 3>We call the whatever they call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who they called,</v>

134
00:05:55.571 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 3>paramedics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>firemen up and I swear to God these guys</v>

135
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 3>were treated like fucking superheroes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fireman and then cops came behind them</v>

136
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:09.491
<v Speaker 3>and everybody was so nice and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendly to him because it was at that </v>

137
00:06:09.491 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 3>sort of honeymoon period after nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>slash 11 when you realized,</v>

138
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when when shit gets awful,</v>

139
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:15.470
<v Speaker 3>we need these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to count on these people.</v>

140
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 3>So people were more friendly in the city</v>
<v Speaker 3>in general and then like really thankful</v>

141
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 3>when the firemen showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

142
00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:27.041
<v Speaker 3>there certainly is a kind of reset </v>
<v Speaker 3>button effect when some kind of disaster</v>

143
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:32.681
<v Speaker 3>happens where we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where people feel like they've lost </v>

144
00:06:32.681 --> 00:06:33.370
<v Speaker 3>control even for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>

145
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.430
<v Speaker 3>it is dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm out here on the highway in la </v>

146
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.861
<v Speaker 3>or anywhere for that matter and you kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of have those moments where you're </v>

147
00:06:41.861 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 3>sitting around looking at all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>vehicles and wondering how the hell this</v>

148
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 3>shit is staying together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is like,</v>

149
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:50.270
<v Speaker 3>how is everybody on this path because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>only takes one asshole one.</v>

150
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.840
<v Speaker 3>What percentage of individuals is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>to like,</v>

151
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:57.850
<v Speaker 3>screw it up for everyone else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you're flying a goddamn plane </v>

152
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.451
<v Speaker 3>into a building or swerve in the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 3>way or looking at your text messages or </v>

153
00:07:01.451 --> 00:07:01.451
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is.</v>

154
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.070
<v Speaker 3>I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

155
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.220
<v Speaker 3>often we kind of take these disasters </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we,</v>

156
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.640
<v Speaker 3>we kind of hold them up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

157
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:12.641
<v Speaker 3>cnn style,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like where you play it over and over </v>

158
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:15.611
<v Speaker 3>again when in reality there's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument to be made that the amazing </v>

159
00:07:15.611 --> 00:07:17.900
<v Speaker 3>part is that it's held together as well </v>
<v Speaker 3>as it is half the time.</v>

160
00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the argument.</v>

161
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.980
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of arguments when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 3>to that,</v>

162
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:24.360
<v Speaker 3>but one of them about gun violence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

163
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:29.570
<v Speaker 3>there's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Showed me a chart the other day of how </v>

164
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.560
<v Speaker 3>much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people have guns,</v>

165
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.860
<v Speaker 3>how many people actually get shot by </v>
<v Speaker 3>guns and who are the people that are </v>

166
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.180
<v Speaker 3>getting shot by guns and how many of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are getting shot by guns are</v>

167
00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:40.730
<v Speaker 3>involved in gang violence or criminal </v>
<v Speaker 3>activity.</v>

168
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:45.731
<v Speaker 3>And then it boils down to how many P,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that your chances of getting </v>

169
00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 3>shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your actual chance of getting shot.</v>

170
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.930
<v Speaker 3>Like do we really have a gun problem or </v>
<v Speaker 3>do we have a numbers problem?</v>

171
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 3>And it really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the hard raw facts,</v>

172
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.220
<v Speaker 3>it's way more of a numbers problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a 300 million people problem.</v>

173
00:07:58.221 --> 00:08:03.221
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at the actual number of </v>

174
00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 3>guns versus the number of gun incidents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's shockingly low.</v>

175
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:10.510
<v Speaker 3>But it's just we're dealing with so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings and that those numbers just</v>

176
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:13.120
<v Speaker 3>seem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I don't,</v>

177
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:18.220
<v Speaker 3>I just don't think human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to have access to 7 billion </v>

178
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 3>human beings on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Worth of drama and stories,</v>

179
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

180
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

181
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.740
<v Speaker 3>when it comes back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the gun situation,</v>

182
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:28.980
<v Speaker 3>I think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

183
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.040
<v Speaker 3>the issue there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I see it as like,</v>

184
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:36.100
<v Speaker 3>it's a communication issue in that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think you've got these different groups </v>

185
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:40.571
<v Speaker 3>picking a side on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is sort of relative to their </v>

186
00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:43.121
<v Speaker 3>personal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their personal experience and how </v>

187
00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:43.121
<v Speaker 3>they've been affected by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

188
00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:45.440
<v Speaker 3>As opposed to big picture like what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually happening.</v>

189
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.670
<v Speaker 3>And inevitably what will happen is </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll have some kind of a,</v>

190
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:55.120
<v Speaker 3>some kind of columbine situation and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a sudden everybody cares because of </v>

191
00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 3>the type of people affected by it</v>

192
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.160
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then half the year when it's a </v>

193
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.291
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a different group of people shooting </v>

194
00:09:03.291 --> 00:09:05.361
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's not making headline news in </v>

195
00:09:05.361 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 2>the same fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's a lot more segmented.</v>

196
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:11.571
<v Speaker 2>I think that those issues of affecting </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain communities are more community </v>

197
00:09:11.571 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 2>issues than they are national issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

198
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they definitely are.</v>

199
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:20.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like look at Chicago and Chicago is </v>

200
00:09:20.481 --> 00:09:20.481
<v Speaker 2>close to you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

201
00:09:20.481 --> 00:09:20.600
<v Speaker 2>very much so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

202
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the thing,</v>

203
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 2>the weird thing about Chicago is it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really nice,</v>

204
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 2>like beautiful if you're in the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>spot.</v>

205
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's one,</v>

206
00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:31.350
<v Speaker 2>one set of circumstances and then on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other side of some imaginary line,</v>

207
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.380
<v Speaker 2>it's a different set of circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Murder rate is up more than 70 percent </v>

208
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.760
<v Speaker 2>this year from last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last year was insane.</v>

209
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.040
<v Speaker 2>At least that's what I read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

210
00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:41.630
<v Speaker 2>it sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

211
00:09:41.631 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 2>I keep hearing about it.</v>

212
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was some kind of a blog I was </v>

213
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.571
<v Speaker 2>reading which was like based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>infographics and all this guy does the </v>

214
00:09:50.571 --> 00:09:53.550
<v Speaker 2>entire blog is just following Chicago </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence as the whole thing.</v>

215
00:09:53.551 --> 00:09:58.551
<v Speaker 2>And he had it all mapped out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a every single shooting fatal </v>

216
00:09:58.551 --> 00:10:03.021
<v Speaker 2>shooting where the person was hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like an amazing amount of detail </v>

217
00:10:03.021 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 2>that went into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this particular blog.</v>

218
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm 72 percent is soared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventy two percent.</v>

219
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.900
<v Speaker 2>Two thousand 16 shootings up more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>80 percent.</v>

220
00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.420
<v Speaker 2>80 eight percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

221
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.250
<v Speaker 2>That is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So murder up 72 percent,</v>

222
00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:19.251
<v Speaker 2>shootings up 88 percent the first three </v>
<v Speaker 2>months of 2016 compared to the same </v>

223
00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:21.270
<v Speaker 2>period last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

224
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:26.410
<v Speaker 2>There was a video that this guy did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was live his neighborhood and he got </v>

225
00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:26.520
<v Speaker 2>shot on video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that?</v>

226
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.110
<v Speaker 2>It's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just hanging out there,</v>

227
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking around and I don't know what he </v>

228
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.431
<v Speaker 2>was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was filming something and all of </v>

229
00:10:37.431 --> 00:10:39.231
<v Speaker 2>a sudden you see him drop and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the shooter standing over him </v>

230
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.470
<v Speaker 2>shooting at somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is fucking crazy.</v>

231
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know we look at it like Juarez.</v>

232
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:47.190
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

233
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.620
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this guy is hanging out here.</v>

234
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.970
<v Speaker 2>At least I'm going to duck for cover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what he's saying?</v>

235
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:03.510
<v Speaker 2>So he's listening to music.</v>

236
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.300
<v Speaker 4>Hey pops tobacco for the kid.</v>

237
00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.140
<v Speaker 2>So He's wandering around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

238
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:18.420
<v Speaker 2>Someone just shot up what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Sky on loaded the whole clip.</v>

239
00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.740
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that guy survived.</v>

240
00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Now that guy's dead as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh right.</v>

241
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:31.400
<v Speaker 2>Well that's weird watching somebody die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not really into that.</v>

242
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:37.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean I assume he's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like if that guy kept shooting </v>

243
00:11:37.971 --> 00:11:38.680
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably,</v>

244
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.840
<v Speaker 2>his work was done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it sure seemed like.</v>

245
00:11:41.841 --> 00:11:44.750
<v Speaker 2>But the weird thing is it looked like he</v>
<v Speaker 2>was shooting over top of him.</v>

246
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.760
<v Speaker 2>Did he die?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was in critical condition.</v>

247
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by now you might be,</v>

248
00:11:49.101 --> 00:11:53.260
<v Speaker 2>but you might have also survive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That place is a war zone.</v>

249
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

250
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.270
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

251
00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.720
<v Speaker 3>I think at this point we've got enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence to realize that at some root </v>

252
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 3>level we are still animals and when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to vengeance or revenge,</v>

253
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.860
<v Speaker 3>everybody's susceptible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you brother,</v>

254
00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:12.070
<v Speaker 3>your neighbor gets killed or you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody you care about,</v>

255
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.930
<v Speaker 3>you just want to go and do the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

256
00:12:13.931 --> 00:12:18.931
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and whether it's in Chicago or it's in </v>

257
00:12:18.931 --> 00:12:18.931
<v Speaker 3>the Middle East or wherever it happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>

258
00:12:18.931 --> 00:12:19.450
<v Speaker 3>People who have been doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

259
00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:20.140
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

260
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.040
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember who I was talking to </v>

261
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.040
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

262
00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.070
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was regarding whether or not more </v>

263
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.081
<v Speaker 3>humans were responsible for killing </v>
<v Speaker 3>other humans in modern history or </v>

264
00:12:31.081 --> 00:12:32.560
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like which one was the bigger figure.</v>

265
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:36.700
<v Speaker 3>And I'm sitting there thinking about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I couldn't,</v>

266
00:12:36.701 --> 00:12:38.440
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I looked it up,</v>

267
00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:43.441
<v Speaker 3>it was like shocking figures in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction of humans killing humans.</v>

268
00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.870
<v Speaker 3>If you're including all the wars that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have ever happened,</v>

269
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.290
<v Speaker 3>millions of people that have died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is modern,</v>

270
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.570
<v Speaker 3>modern history over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

271
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:54.870
<v Speaker 3>But I don't know if it was on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>wikipedia page or something.</v>

272
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.750
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the craziest,</v>

273
00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:00.780
<v Speaker 3>craziest statistics I've ever heard </v>
<v Speaker 3>about a human's dying was that half of </v>

274
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.220
<v Speaker 3>all the people that have ever died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever were killed by malaria mosquitoes.</v>

275
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.710
<v Speaker 3>The most dangerous animal on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking malaria,</v>

276
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:07.240
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a dude is added more than twice.</v>

277
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.760
<v Speaker 3>Justin's got it again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Justin wren,</v>

278
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:11.360
<v Speaker 3>who got it again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got layer.</v>

279
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.960
<v Speaker 3>He lives in the Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he spends time in the Congo.</v>

280
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:17.260
<v Speaker 3>He's got this foundation called fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the forgotten.</v>

281
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.040
<v Speaker 3>And they go and they build a wells in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Congo for people.</v>

282
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:22.930
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been over there many,</v>

283
00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:25.300
<v Speaker 3>many times and this is the second time </v>
<v Speaker 3>he got malaria.</v>

284
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:30.300
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that he was saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there's different forms of malaria </v>

285
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.740
<v Speaker 3>and some malaria will last six months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some malaria last five years,</v>

286
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:37.840
<v Speaker 3>and some malaria last 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 year malaria.</v>

287
00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.150
<v Speaker 3>That's Kinda like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Kinda like that.</v>

288
00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 3>Lyme disease hangs around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

289
00:13:42.941 --> 00:13:46.480
<v Speaker 3>lyme disease is devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's some really bad stuff,</v>

290
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:51.630
<v Speaker 3>especially if you don't catch it quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a gigantic amount of people on </v>

291
00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:53.470
<v Speaker 3>the east coast that have lined to stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>just stays in your system,</v>

292
00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.760
<v Speaker 3>whether it's from deer ticks and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to figure out what to do about that</v>

293
00:13:57.761 --> 00:14:02.761
<v Speaker 3>because there's a lot of places in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>east coast that are just overwhelmed </v>

294
00:14:02.761 --> 00:14:03.310
<v Speaker 3>with deer because they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>predators.</v>

295
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.970
<v Speaker 3>So they have all these deer and the only</v>
<v Speaker 3>predators that they're having now,</v>

296
00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:10.210
<v Speaker 3>the coyotes have kind of expanded their </v>
<v Speaker 3>range.</v>

297
00:14:10.211 --> 00:14:12.770
<v Speaker 3>And there used to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an animal that was more in the,</v>

298
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.290
<v Speaker 3>in the west and the prairies.</v>

299
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.370
<v Speaker 3>There's this amazing podcast right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if anybody's interested in this,</v>

300
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:23.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend Steve Rinella has this show </v>

301
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.551
<v Speaker 3>called meat eater and it's on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sportsmans channel and there's a new </v>

302
00:14:26.551 --> 00:14:28.090
<v Speaker 3>podcast are not new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's been doing it for awhile.</v>

303
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.360
<v Speaker 3>It's called the mediator podcasts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got this guy on named Dan Flores </v>

304
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.890
<v Speaker 3>and Dan Flores is a historian and he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of Steve's a former professors and </v>

305
00:14:38.441 --> 00:14:43.441
<v Speaker 3>he has this book coming out about </v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes and it is fucking fascinating.</v>

306
00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.500
<v Speaker 3>The knowledge that is guide drops about </v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes will blow you away.</v>

307
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.360
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes or wolves to kind of wolf.</v>

308
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 3>They used</v>

309
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 5>to call them prairie wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they used to call them,</v>

310
00:14:54.831 --> 00:14:59.150
<v Speaker 5>but it's like a type of wolf and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>breed with wolves.</v>

311
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:04.210
<v Speaker 5>Most wolves except gray wolves because </v>
<v Speaker 5>gray wolves have a different genetic </v>

312
00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:09.011
<v Speaker 5>line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had left North America millions of </v>

313
00:15:09.011 --> 00:15:09.011
<v Speaker 5>years ago and then came back like </v>
<v Speaker 5>within,</v>

314
00:15:09.011 --> 00:15:09.270
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>x amount,</v>

315
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:14.290
<v Speaker 5>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they kill coyotes when they find </v>

316
00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:18.731
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but red wolves and some other North </v>

317
00:15:18.731 --> 00:15:21.440
<v Speaker 5>American wolves that still survived </v>
<v Speaker 5>those wolves bread with coyotes,</v>

318
00:15:21.441 --> 00:15:23.510
<v Speaker 5>and they're creating this thing called a</v>
<v Speaker 5>coil wolf,</v>

319
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 5>which is like a hybrid of coyotes and </v>
<v Speaker 5>wolves.</v>

320
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this where geographically</v>

321
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.650
<v Speaker 5>all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all over the country,</v>

322
00:15:32.651 --> 00:15:34.570
<v Speaker 5>rather all of this country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this country,</v>

323
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.970
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it used to be a small range of coyotes,</v>

324
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.510
<v Speaker 5>but due to persecution,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've expanded their range and part of</v>

325
00:15:40.511 --> 00:15:42.580
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the persecution is not by humans,</v>

326
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:47.760
<v Speaker 5>but by the gray wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the gray wolves are killing </v>

327
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:47.760
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what?</v>

328
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:47.830
<v Speaker 5>What coyotes do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is so fascinating.</v>

329
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.840
<v Speaker 5>Coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they call out,</v>

330
00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.140
<v Speaker 5>when you hear coyotes and then other </v>
<v Speaker 5>ones call out.</v>

331
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.660
<v Speaker 5>What they're doing is they're doing a </v>
<v Speaker 5>roll call.</v>

332
00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:59.800
<v Speaker 5>They're making sure that everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and when coyote to get killed,</v>

333
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.350
<v Speaker 5>when coyotes are under pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when carbs get killed,</v>

334
00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:06.160
<v Speaker 5>there's a reaction in the mother or the </v>
<v Speaker 5>female.</v>

335
00:16:06.161 --> 00:16:09.340
<v Speaker 5>Coyotes have larger litters.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the normal litter,</v>

336
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.880
<v Speaker 5>if nothing's disturbed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is between three and four pups.</v>

337
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:18.060
<v Speaker 5>But if they get killed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they noticed that their numbers are </v>

338
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.450
<v Speaker 5>dwindling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're numbers jack up to as many as 13</v>

339
00:16:19.451 --> 00:16:24.451
<v Speaker 5>to 14 puppies per litter per litter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and doing that as a result of being </v>

340
00:16:25.931 --> 00:16:28.330
<v Speaker 5>persecuted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>realtime upgrade realtime upgrades.</v>

341
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.250
<v Speaker 5>So one of the things that they've been </v>
<v Speaker 5>studying,</v>

342
00:16:30.251 --> 00:16:35.251
<v Speaker 5>this is in yellowstone park,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because yellowstone park for more than </v>

343
00:16:35.251 --> 00:16:38.521
<v Speaker 5>70 years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had no wolves because they had </v>

344
00:16:38.521 --> 00:16:41.081
<v Speaker 5>eradicated wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had extra paid them from </v>

345
00:16:41.081 --> 00:16:43.231
<v Speaker 5>yellowstone park.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then they reintroduced them in the 19 </v>

346
00:16:43.231 --> 00:16:43.231
<v Speaker 5>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they.</v>

347
00:16:43.231 --> 00:16:46.240
<v Speaker 5>The population of coyotes during that </v>
<v Speaker 5>time was exactly the same.</v>

348
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.870
<v Speaker 5>It was completely steady until they </v>
<v Speaker 5>brought in wolves.</v>

349
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.890
<v Speaker 5>And when the wolves started killing the </v>
<v Speaker 5>coyotes,</v>

350
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.710
<v Speaker 5>they're gray wolves that they brought in</v>
<v Speaker 5>from Canada.</v>

351
00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.500
<v Speaker 5>The gray wolf started killing the </v>
<v Speaker 5>coyote.</v>

352
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.960
<v Speaker 5>The coyote is expanded like crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>multiplied like nuts.</v>

353
00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:04.290
<v Speaker 5>And now the initial thing that happened </v>
<v Speaker 5>when they brought in wolves was at the </v>

354
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.370
<v Speaker 5>wolves killed a giant percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>coyote and the coyote population dropped</v>

355
00:17:06.371 --> 00:17:11.371
<v Speaker 5>by 50 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then once the coyote started having </v>

356
00:17:11.371 --> 00:17:13.510
<v Speaker 5>much larger litters because there will </v>
<v Speaker 5>be killed off by walls,</v>

357
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.840
<v Speaker 5>their numbers went as high as they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>before and now even higher and now </v>

358
00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:23.161
<v Speaker 5>they've expanded their range.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So thanks to the reintroduction of </v>

359
00:17:23.161 --> 00:17:26.221
<v Speaker 5>wolves in Yellowstone Park.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got coyotes all over the </v>

360
00:17:26.221 --> 00:17:26.400
<v Speaker 5>continental North America now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

361
00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.100
<v Speaker 5>Fucking courageous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Interesting.</v>

362
00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:28.310
<v Speaker 5>You</v>

363
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.910
<v Speaker 2>brought this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a very weird experience recently.</v>

364
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:33.170
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

365
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:33.910
<v Speaker 2>I live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

366
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:35.930
<v Speaker 2>I live just north of the city in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto,</v>

367
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:40.931
<v Speaker 2>like still completely urbanized area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be like here to downtown La,</v>

368
00:17:41.691 --> 00:17:43.510
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

369
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.780
<v Speaker 2>I was going to visit my parents house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They live roughly in the same area and I</v>

370
00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:52.781
<v Speaker 2>went past a place where I went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>elementary school in a neighborhood </v>

371
00:17:53.821 --> 00:17:58.821
<v Speaker 2>houses everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A wolf came straight in front of my </v>

372
00:17:58.821 --> 00:17:59.580
<v Speaker 2>vehicle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>limping,</v>

373
00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.960
<v Speaker 2>looked right at me and continued on into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back of that elementary school,</v>

374
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.000
<v Speaker 2>a legit wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

375
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:11.001
<v Speaker 2>is this a coyote?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm sizing it up as I'm staring at </v>

376
00:18:11.001 --> 00:18:11.001
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sure enough,</v>

377
00:18:11.001 --> 00:18:12.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this couldn't,</v>

378
00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:17.090
<v Speaker 2>this can't be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never seen a wolf my whole life in </v>

379
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:19.641
<v Speaker 2>this area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then so what I ended up doing is I </v>

380
00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:22.971
<v Speaker 2>went online and I typed the town name </v>
<v Speaker 2>along with wolf and sure enough people </v>

381
00:18:22.971 --> 00:18:25.500
<v Speaker 2>have been spotting wolves coming into </v>
<v Speaker 2>that area.</v>

382
00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.960
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friends live outside of Edmonton,</v>

383
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the big ones,</v>

384
00:18:30.091 --> 00:18:32.690
<v Speaker 2>a big wolf was in front of my friend's </v>
<v Speaker 2>truck today.</v>

385
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.600
<v Speaker 2>Just walking around the fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just sent me this this morning,</v>

386
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.180
<v Speaker 2>just walking around the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>staring at him.</v>

387
00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.490
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

388
00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:46.230
<v Speaker 3>That's a different kind of animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way they look at you is there.</v>

389
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:51.350
<v Speaker 3>They're fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but coyotes are almost more fascinating </v>

390
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.350
<v Speaker 3>because their ability to adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

391
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.260
<v Speaker 3>they tried to wipe out the coyote during</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 19 thirties.</v>

392
00:18:53.261 --> 00:18:58.261
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to give too much of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>information because this is all Dan </v>

393
00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:02.310
<v Speaker 3>Flores is a information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all really much better distributed </v>

394
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:04.190
<v Speaker 3>by him off of this mediator podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You really should.</v>

395
00:19:04.191 --> 00:19:06.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not the most recent mediator </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts,</v>

396
00:19:06.611 --> 00:19:09.430
<v Speaker 3>but the one before that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and today's date is the 20,</v>

397
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:10.870
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>30th,</v>

398
00:19:10.871 --> 00:19:14.290
<v Speaker 3>30th of April.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So find it,</v>

399
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:15.160
<v Speaker 3>find it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to it.</v>

400
00:19:15.161 --> 00:19:20.161
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might not be into hunting and I get </v>

401
00:19:20.161 --> 00:19:20.500
<v Speaker 3>that if you're not a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a hunting podcasts.</v>

402
00:19:20.501 --> 00:19:25.501
<v Speaker 3>That one is not about hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about the wild west and about </v>

403
00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:28.180
<v Speaker 3>the animals that used to exist on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planes and uh,</v>

404
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.810
<v Speaker 3>they're actually trying to set aside a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gigantic chunk,</v>

405
00:19:31.811 --> 00:19:36.811
<v Speaker 3>I think it's in Montana or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that where they're trying to </v>

406
00:19:36.811 --> 00:19:40.650
<v Speaker 3>establish a new yellow stone type of </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation where they bring in a lot of </v>

407
00:19:41.651 --> 00:19:46.651
<v Speaker 3>these animals and allow them to live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a natural way and some large sort of,</v>

408
00:19:47.081 --> 00:19:48.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

409
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.930
<v Speaker 3>like a savannah type area.</v>

410
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:50.690
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

411
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.020
<v Speaker 3>like recreating sort of the African </v>
<v Speaker 3>savannas.</v>

412
00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:53.970
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

413
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:57.760
<v Speaker 3>What now that sounds dangerous to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

414
00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:02.790
<v Speaker 3>they're just talking about animals that </v>
<v Speaker 3>already exists of animals like wolves </v>

415
00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:04.360
<v Speaker 3>and bison and like local,</v>
<v Speaker 3>local with.</v>

416
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:09.390
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to have whatever would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have texted large wild protected area </v>

417
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.410
<v Speaker 3>where they can't develop and no one can </v>
<v Speaker 3>frack.</v>

418
00:20:11.411 --> 00:20:12.190
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of,</v>

419
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:18.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a video I put up the other day </v>

420
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.070
<v Speaker 3>from a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was in Sweden,</v>

421
00:20:18.130 --> 00:20:23.130
<v Speaker 3>I forget what town it was in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were lighting lighting a lake </v>

422
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:27.601
<v Speaker 3>on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lake has gotten so fucked up from </v>

423
00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:28.180
<v Speaker 3>fracking that you can light the lake on </v>
<v Speaker 3>fire.</v>

424
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:33.390
<v Speaker 3>So they go up to this lake with a blow </v>
<v Speaker 3>torch and they blow it on the lake and </v>

425
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.940
<v Speaker 3>the whole lake lights on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>

426
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.860
<v Speaker 3>that's like a bigger version of what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were doing on the taps,</v>

427
00:20:38.861 --> 00:20:39.700
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

428
00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:44.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know much about fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the tap thing is controversial </v>

429
00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 3>only because some people say that some </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that</v>

430
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.910
<v Speaker 2>natural gas that got into that water had</v>
<v Speaker 2>already gotten into that water.</v>

431
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:53.680
<v Speaker 2>And this is a common phenomenon that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could.</v>

432
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.360
<v Speaker 2>You could actually document back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

433
00:20:55.390 --> 00:21:00.390
<v Speaker 2>decades before fracking every assistant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it could be that the natural gas,</v>

434
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:02.590
<v Speaker 2>which was already in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

435
00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:07.591
<v Speaker 2>They're already trying to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're trying to get out </v>

436
00:21:07.591 --> 00:21:07.591
<v Speaker 2>when they're fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

437
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:10.840
<v Speaker 2>That it was already leaking into some </v>
<v Speaker 2>water in some places,</v>

438
00:21:10.841 --> 00:21:15.841
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't remove the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 2>of fracking making more of that shit get</v>

439
00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:20.971
<v Speaker 2>into people's water supply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's real tricky because they want </v>

440
00:21:20.971 --> 00:21:23.350
<v Speaker 2>these people that are anti fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

441
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:28.380
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to point out the dangers of </v>

442
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:28.380
<v Speaker 2>fracking and the people that are pro </v>
<v Speaker 2>fracking,</v>

443
00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:33.060
<v Speaker 2>they want to pretend that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>danger and it's like there's no middle </v>

444
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:33.790
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the documentary on Netflix,</v>

445
00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.590
<v Speaker 2>merchants of doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen that?</v>

446
00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

447
00:21:37.571 --> 00:21:42.571
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's all about the agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any amount of money you have to further </v>

448
00:21:43.421 --> 00:21:45.670
<v Speaker 2>that agenda and how much you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>extract.</v>

449
00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:50.671
<v Speaker 2>If you can push your agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you extract the money and then you put </v>

450
00:21:50.671 --> 00:21:53.671
<v Speaker 2>it back in to continue to lobby or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it might be to continue that </v>

451
00:21:53.671 --> 00:21:54.550
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like when he talks specifically</v>

452
00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:59.410
<v Speaker 2>about how individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they only need a fragment of information</v>

453
00:21:59.411 --> 00:22:00.880
<v Speaker 2>in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

454
00:22:00.881 --> 00:22:03.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confirm their preexisting bias.</v>

455
00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:05.020
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't need a whole story,</v>

456
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.200
<v Speaker 2>just like just have to present the </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative argument.</v>

457
00:22:08.201 --> 00:22:10.960
<v Speaker 2>Make people think it's an argument in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first place.</v>

458
00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:15.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they'll pick the side that's </v>

459
00:22:15.961 --> 00:22:15.961
<v Speaker 2>more convenient to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like climate change.</v>

460
00:22:15.961 --> 00:22:18.160
<v Speaker 2>That's a perfect one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's this young Republican kid</v>

461
00:22:18.161 --> 00:22:21.900
<v Speaker 2>from my Jujitsu class who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody brought up climate change.</v>

462
00:22:21.901 --> 00:22:26.901
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't even a conversation that was </v>

463
00:22:26.901 --> 00:22:26.901
<v Speaker 2>involved in.</v>

464
00:22:26.901 --> 00:22:26.901
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the cycle.</v>

465
00:22:26.901 --> 00:22:26.901
<v Speaker 2>So there's always been a cycle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

466
00:22:26.901 --> 00:22:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Are you a fucking earth scientists do </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

467
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.100
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

468
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.520
<v Speaker 2>you just got out of the marines and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

469
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:36.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure you weren't studying </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth science in Afghanistan.</v>

470
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:41.430
<v Speaker 2>Like come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man is like a super complicated issue </v>

471
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.720
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have decades of science behind them</v>

472
00:22:43.721 --> 00:22:46.000
<v Speaker 2>and they're researching the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the numbers.</v>

473
00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:48.940
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got a consensus.</v>

474
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come you're not with them?</v>

475
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:52.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a part,</v>

476
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:57.630
<v Speaker 2>I think part of it is the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way we've sort of been conditioned via </v>

477
00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.940
<v Speaker 2>media is to feel empowered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

478
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:04.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like you watch this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you watch this clip and you think you're</v>

479
00:23:04.991 --> 00:23:09.991
<v Speaker 2>getting information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in reality you're getting a </v>

480
00:23:09.991 --> 00:23:09.991
<v Speaker 2>headline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

481
00:23:09.991 --> 00:23:13.410
<v Speaker 2>Because that's the flow that will keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>you engaged where you feel like you're </v>

482
00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:17.881
<v Speaker 2>getting smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no way in hell you're </v>

483
00:23:17.881 --> 00:23:18.100
<v Speaker 2>putting in the time to be educated on </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain subject matter.</v>

484
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.220
<v Speaker 2>He getting just enough to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said before,</v>

485
00:23:21.221 --> 00:23:26.221
<v Speaker 2>confirm kind of what you thought already</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then go out and pretend that as you </v>

486
00:23:26.221 --> 00:23:28.700
<v Speaker 2>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're some kind of authority on,</v>

487
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:33.720
<v Speaker 2>on the situation when there's other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people out there that have invested so </v>

488
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.890
<v Speaker 2>much more in their perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instead of admitting like,</v>

489
00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:36.540
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

490
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:41.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know too much about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it is a complicated issue or there's </v>

491
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:45.540
<v Speaker 2>more to the conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something empowering about </v>

492
00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 2>picking aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you don't necessarily</v>

493
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.120
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

494
00:23:47.121 --> 00:23:52.121
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something very </v>
<v Speaker 3>problematic about headlines to like </v>

495
00:23:52.121 --> 00:23:55.070
<v Speaker 3>these Gotcha clickbait headlines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a headline recently about</v>

496
00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Bill Nye the science guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Nye Bowtie.</v>

497
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.320
<v Speaker 3>I grew up on that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

498
00:24:00.321 --> 00:24:05.321
<v Speaker 3>Bill Nye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the science guy has done a fantastic </v>

499
00:24:05.321 --> 00:24:05.321
<v Speaker 3>child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

500
00:24:05.321 --> 00:24:05.321
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

501
00:24:05.321 --> 00:24:05.840
<v Speaker 3>It's not a bad thing about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fine.</v>

502
00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.120
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Bill Nye the science guy.</v>

503
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:13.840
<v Speaker 3>He's done a fantastic job of trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make science interesting to people and </v>

504
00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.170
<v Speaker 3>trying to educate people and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make science something that's compelling</v>

505
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:23.200
<v Speaker 3>and make young people drawn to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Bill Nye the science guy was having a</v>

506
00:24:23.631 --> 00:24:25.730
<v Speaker 3>conversation with this guy and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>article,</v>

507
00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:27.760
<v Speaker 3>the topic of the article or the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

508
00:24:27.761 --> 00:24:32.761
<v Speaker 3>the headline said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Nye favors prison terms for climate</v>

509
00:24:34.161 --> 00:24:35.990
<v Speaker 3>deniers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're like,</v>

510
00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:39.380
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it was bill Nye lost his fucking</v>

511
00:24:39.381 --> 00:24:40.760
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is he gone crazy?</v>

512
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:45.050
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read this piece and then I watched the</v>

513
00:24:45.051 --> 00:24:46.700
<v Speaker 3>actual interview with Bill Nye.</v>

514
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:51.910
<v Speaker 3>He never said such a thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone suggested that climate deniers </v>

515
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:58.930
<v Speaker 3>should go to jail because these energy </v>
<v Speaker 3>ceos and these people that are spreading</v>

516
00:25:00.141 --> 00:25:04.060
<v Speaker 3>misinformation or directly harming the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are,</v>

517
00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:09.090
<v Speaker 3>that are going to be affected by that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know that they're saying something </v>

518
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:09.090
<v Speaker 3>incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do it to,</v>

519
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:14.020
<v Speaker 3>to distribute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's other people who are going </v>

520
00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:14.270
<v Speaker 3>to be affected by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Bill Nye says,</v>

521
00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:18.470
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about these energy ceos and these people</v>

522
00:25:18.471 --> 00:25:21.950
<v Speaker 3>are making choices that are going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>directly affect our quality of life.</v>

523
00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:23.470
<v Speaker 3>What do we do about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>

524
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's literally all he said.</v>

525
00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.900
<v Speaker 3>The headline says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Nye favors climate deniers going to</v>

526
00:25:29.901 --> 00:25:31.970
<v Speaker 3>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's clickbait bullshit.</v>

527
00:25:31.971 --> 00:25:33.170
<v Speaker 3>So when you read that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

528
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:34.940
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking fascist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

529
00:25:34.941 --> 00:25:36.830
<v Speaker 3>you don't even have scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gino,</v>

530
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.220
<v Speaker 3>where he got his degree and who's and </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's the type of personality,</v>

531
00:25:40.221 --> 00:25:45.140
<v Speaker 3>who's most inclined to pick that as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual who doesn't want to invest in</v>

532
00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.770
<v Speaker 3>discovering even the article they'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>just take because it's easier.</v>

533
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.890
<v Speaker 3>It's easier to take the headline and </v>
<v Speaker 3>form your perspective than it is to </v>

534
00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:54.920
<v Speaker 3>invest into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also because the people that are putting</v>

535
00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:59.921
<v Speaker 3>that headline out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all they want to do is make people read </v>

536
00:25:59.921 --> 00:25:59.921
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

537
00:25:59.921 --> 00:26:00.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch it,</v>

538
00:26:00.561 --> 00:26:02.300
<v Speaker 3>read it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the clicks to get the money.</v>

539
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.470
<v Speaker 3>That's where they get the ad clicks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Impressions.</v>

540
00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:09.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the only thing they're </v>

541
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:10.961
<v Speaker 3>trying to do and they're trying to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>it as salacious and as inviting as </v>

542
00:26:10.961 --> 00:26:10.961
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

543
00:26:10.961 --> 00:26:13.100
<v Speaker 3>and the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way to really combat that is to</v>

544
00:26:13.101 --> 00:26:18.101
<v Speaker 3>bounce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to get out of there as quickly as </v>

545
00:26:18.101 --> 00:26:19.280
<v Speaker 3>possible because.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the way I understand it,</v>

546
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:23.750
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily an expert in the field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of done a few things on youtube,</v>

547
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.710
<v Speaker 3>but like as far as the Google page rank </v>
<v Speaker 3>is concerned,</v>

548
00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:33.100
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if a site is getting a quick bounce </v>

549
00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.801
<v Speaker 3>rate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if people are landing on it and </v>

550
00:26:35.801 --> 00:26:35.801
<v Speaker 3>leaving really quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it would,</v>

551
00:26:35.801 --> 00:26:39.840
<v Speaker 3>it would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could potentially be ranked lower in </v>

552
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:39.840
<v Speaker 3>the future because of that.</v>

553
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:39.840
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

554
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.680
<v Speaker 3>So you have to have a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time that you hover on a site before.</v>

555
00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 3>So the money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

556
00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.030
<v Speaker 3>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

557
00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.240
<v Speaker 3>not for them to unlock money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for them to surface in the future.</v>

558
00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:52.140
<v Speaker 3>Like Google will penalize sites that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have low retention.</v>

559
00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:57.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like videos that have low </v>

560
00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:57.290
<v Speaker 3>retention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's very intelligent.</v>

561
00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem is that you probably had</v>

562
00:26:58.291 --> 00:27:01.530
<v Speaker 3>to read the whole damn thing to get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the conclusion that he didn't say it.</v>

563
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched the interview itself.</v>

564
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:05.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was video and yeah.</v>

565
00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Was opposed video and there was a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's text along with the video.</v>

566
00:27:09.331 --> 00:27:09.860
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

567
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:10.740
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we,</v>

568
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:14.250
<v Speaker 3>we should name the site the piece of </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit site that ruined your day.</v>

569
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't ruin my day if you can find it</v>

570
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.880
<v Speaker 3>on Jake because I defended Bill Nye on </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter and I said this is not his </v>

571
00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.190
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not what he was saying,</v>

572
00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:27.330
<v Speaker 3>but let's watch the video itself and if </v>
<v Speaker 3>we watched the video itself,</v>

573
00:27:27.331 --> 00:27:32.331
<v Speaker 3>you can see how deceptive it is to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he favors people who deny climate </v>

574
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:37.230
<v Speaker 3>change to go to jail because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>what he's saying at all.</v>

575
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:42.530
<v Speaker 3>Essentially he's saying that we should </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at people that are ruining the </v>

576
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:46.821
<v Speaker 3>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like these energy ceos that wantonly </v>

577
00:27:46.821 --> 00:27:48.480
<v Speaker 3>pollute these areas in order to gain </v>
<v Speaker 3>profit.</v>

578
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.480
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just it so we could hear it</v>

579
00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:57.400
<v Speaker 6>near the environmentalist here at the </v>
<v Speaker 6>people's climate march in 2014.</v>

580
00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:01.230
<v Speaker 6>However,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he said that the climate deniers,</v>

581
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:06.260
<v Speaker 6>his word entity ceos belong at the Hague</v>
<v Speaker 6>with three square meals and a cot with </v>

582
00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.460
<v Speaker 6>all the other war criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is your thought on that?</v>

583
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.560
<v Speaker 6>Do you think some of the rhetoric on </v>
<v Speaker 6>your side,</v>

584
00:28:10.561 --> 00:28:12.480
<v Speaker 6>as I'm sure both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but some of the rhetoric and just had to</v>

585
00:28:12.481 --> 00:28:13.740
<v Speaker 6>get too carried away?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

586
00:28:13.741 --> 00:28:18.741
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's your thought on jailing skeptics </v>

587
00:28:18.741 --> 00:28:18.741
<v Speaker 6>as war criminals?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll see what happens.</v>

588
00:28:18.741 --> 00:28:20.940
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was it appropriate to jail the guys from</v>

589
00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:23.370
<v Speaker 6>Enron?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Interesting.</v>

590
00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:24.000
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

591
00:28:24.001 --> 00:28:29.001
<v Speaker 6>So we'll see what happens if was it </v>
<v Speaker 6>appropriate to jail people from the </v>

592
00:28:29.001 --> 00:28:32.520
<v Speaker 6>cigarette industry you insisted,</v>
<v Speaker 6>insisted that this addictive product was</v>

593
00:28:32.521 --> 00:28:36.750
<v Speaker 6>not addictive and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you think about in these cases,</v>

594
00:28:36.751 --> 00:28:39.900
<v Speaker 6>for me as a taxpayer and voter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

595
00:28:39.901 --> 00:28:42.930
<v Speaker 6>the doubting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the introduction of this extreme doubt,</v>

596
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:47.990
<v Speaker 6>will you go with extreme doubt about </v>
<v Speaker 6>climate change is affecting my quality </v>

597
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:52.581
<v Speaker 6>of life as a public citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I can see where people are very </v>

598
00:28:52.581 --> 00:28:56.700
<v Speaker 6>concerned about this and are pursuing </v>
<v Speaker 6>criminal investigations as well as,</v>

599
00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:57.800
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

600
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.320
<v Speaker 6>as well as engaging in discussions like </v>
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

601
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:07.220
<v Speaker 3>That is a very measured response.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's essentially talking about </v>

602
00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.960
<v Speaker 3>people like the BP people that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>polluted the golf.</v>

603
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:15.200
<v Speaker 3>That's what he's talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not saying that you know someone </v>

604
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.980
<v Speaker 3>who like the kid from my Jujitsu class </v>
<v Speaker 3>that thinks it's a cycle of life,</v>

605
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.780
<v Speaker 3>you should go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

606
00:29:18.781 --> 00:29:20.880
<v Speaker 3>and even even if you look at the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>end there,</v>

607
00:29:20.881 --> 00:29:25.881
<v Speaker 3>he made sure to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see why people might think </v>

608
00:29:25.881 --> 00:29:28.581
<v Speaker 3>something like that instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily confirming that that's the </v>

609
00:29:28.581 --> 00:29:31.671
<v Speaker 3>outcome he wants to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's making good points and you if you </v>

610
00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.460
<v Speaker 3>do like that merchants of doubt movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is amazing movie.</v>

611
00:29:35.461 --> 00:29:40.461
<v Speaker 3>If you watch that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you realize that the same people that </v>

612
00:29:40.461 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 3>were working for the tobacco industry </v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were denying the</v>

613
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:47.190
<v Speaker 2>addictive effects of tobacco are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same people that are denying climate </v>

614
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:50.770
<v Speaker 2>change and human beings like not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same kind of people,</v>

615
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.880
<v Speaker 2>but the exact same people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

616
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:56.290
<v Speaker 2>that's a little bit much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

617
00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:01.150
<v Speaker 2>that's what they do and they get checks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's direct checks from these tobacco</v>

618
00:30:01.151 --> 00:30:03.760
<v Speaker 2>companies as direct checks from these </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy companies.</v>

619
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.960
<v Speaker 2>They're getting paid for this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

620
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:11.970
<v Speaker 2>coming back to the click bait subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't thing they click bait is always </v>

621
00:30:12.551 --> 00:30:13.360
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

622
00:30:13.361 --> 00:30:18.361
<v Speaker 2>it's not always bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think there's a difference </v>

623
00:30:18.361 --> 00:30:18.680
<v Speaker 2>between click bait and lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

624
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:23.760
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think sometimes click bait gets </v>

625
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.030
<v Speaker 2>too much of a bad rap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm in a sense of.</v>

626
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.510
<v Speaker 2>I think a headline should be intriguing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should Pique your interest,</v>

627
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.380
<v Speaker 2>should compel you to click yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which you could say is bait,</v>

628
00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:35.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like I feel like navigating the real</v>

629
00:30:35.471 --> 00:30:36.730
<v Speaker 2>world is full of clickbait.</v>

630
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee is clickbait.</v>

631
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:42.930
<v Speaker 2>And when you see a girl on a tight skirt</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounded Toyota Click Bait,</v>

632
00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:43.990
<v Speaker 2>click bait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

633
00:30:43.991 --> 00:30:45.580
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in that sense,</v>

634
00:30:45.581 --> 00:30:46.300
<v Speaker 2>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

635
00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:50.230
<v Speaker 2>there's a place for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think people use the technique to,</v>

636
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:55.310
<v Speaker 2>to essentially lie and it gives the </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole kind of system of bad rap.</v>

637
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that Bill Nye situation,</v>

638
00:30:57.181 --> 00:31:01.360
<v Speaker 2>there's not always a clickbait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like he should fucking sue.</v>

639
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:02.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really,</v>

640
00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:04.720
<v Speaker 2>but he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not employed anymore.</v>

641
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not to get the ball rolling in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>

642
00:31:07.811 --> 00:31:12.811
<v Speaker 2>But so many people on my timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're calling him a fascist and these </v>

643
00:31:13.031 --> 00:31:15.790
<v Speaker 2>fucking left wingers are so far left now</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're right there.</v>

644
00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.340
<v Speaker 2>Nobody had watched the video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody had read it,</v>

645
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:23.520
<v Speaker 2>nobody had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just immediate reaction with his </v>

646
00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:23.860
<v Speaker 2>little information as possible for you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be upset.</v>

647
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

648
00:31:25.781 --> 00:31:29.380
<v Speaker 2>I just the knee jerk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need jerk response of the web,</v>

649
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:34.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a lot of stuff going on </v>

650
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:34.500
<v Speaker 2>youtube right now.</v>

651
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:35.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of immersed in the youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>world in a social media world,</v>

652
00:31:35.981 --> 00:31:38.860
<v Speaker 2>whenever there's like a lot of drama </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's getting,</v>

653
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.410
<v Speaker 2>getting rewarded recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what kind of drama?</v>

654
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in like without going into too much </v>

655
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:47.230
<v Speaker 2>detail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like a,</v>

656
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:49.840
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a lot of channels that popped up kind</v>

657
00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:52.150
<v Speaker 2>of kind of hating on people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

658
00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:53.890
<v Speaker 2>that's all they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

659
00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:59.040
<v Speaker 2>And that's like the entire agenda is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>use other people's content as the </v>

660
00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:03.541
<v Speaker 2>vehicle for you to have a channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like today I'm going to shit on this </v>

661
00:32:03.541 --> 00:32:04.270
<v Speaker 2>video and tomorrow I'm gonna Shit on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that video.</v>

662
00:32:04.271 --> 00:32:07.000
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this kind of conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

663
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.600
<v Speaker 2>about whether or not that like is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>still fair use in that environment </v>

664
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.820
<v Speaker 2>because the understanding of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not definitive,</v>

665
00:32:15.821 --> 00:32:20.080
<v Speaker 2>but the understanding I have a fair use </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that like if you're compelling people</v>

666
00:32:20.081 --> 00:32:25.081
<v Speaker 2>to go look at the original,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you just did with the information </v>

667
00:32:25.081 --> 00:32:25.081
<v Speaker 2>about coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

668
00:32:25.081 --> 00:32:25.750
<v Speaker 2>you took a moment and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

669
00:32:25.751 --> 00:32:28.010
<v Speaker 2>this is this guy's research or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

670
00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.320
<v Speaker 2>so go check him out.</v>

671
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:34.440
<v Speaker 2>You actually did him a service there </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of the alternative have you </v>

672
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:34.690
<v Speaker 2>could have just talked about and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

673
00:32:34.691 --> 00:32:39.070
<v Speaker 2>in the case of these types of videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are using actual clips from these</v>

674
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 2>that they're shitting on and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>making up their channel.</v>

675
00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

676
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:46.520
<v Speaker 2>and maybe more importantly there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

677
00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:52.340
<v Speaker 2>they don't compel you to go look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>original because essentially they're </v>

678
00:32:52.821 --> 00:32:57.821
<v Speaker 2>hating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you go as a viewer and go </v>

679
00:32:57.821 --> 00:33:00.881
<v Speaker 2>source out this thing that this person </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you like is telling you is a piece </v>

680
00:33:00.881 --> 00:33:04.661
<v Speaker 2>of shit anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to go watch the </v>

681
00:33:04.661 --> 00:33:04.661
<v Speaker 2>original,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

682
00:33:04.661 --> 00:33:04.730
<v Speaker 2>You're happier to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to listen to this guy shit on stuff.</v>

683
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:09.820
<v Speaker 2>And so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem is that a algorithmically it</v>

684
00:33:10.101 --> 00:33:13.250
<v Speaker 2>feels like drama cells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

685
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:18.251
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like in the regular world and so </v>

686
00:33:18.251 --> 00:33:20.231
<v Speaker 2>some of these channels are rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing rapidly growing on the backs of </v>

687
00:33:20.231 --> 00:33:21.020
<v Speaker 2>essentially making fun of people.</v>

688
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:25.490
<v Speaker 2>So there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of feeling in the community,</v>

689
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:30.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that youtube has changed or you get a </v>

690
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:31.310
<v Speaker 2>lot of these people that are like make </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube great again,</v>

691
00:33:31.311 --> 00:33:36.311
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean I don't necessarily agree </v>

692
00:33:36.311 --> 00:33:39.101
<v Speaker 2>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that there is maybe a </v>

693
00:33:39.101 --> 00:33:39.650
<v Speaker 2>conversation to be had about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

694
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:45.130
<v Speaker 2>about how much freedom were willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give individuals to essentially build </v>

695
00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:46.820
<v Speaker 2>their product on the back of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's will.</v>

696
00:33:46.821 --> 00:33:48.980
<v Speaker 2>That is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an important issue when it comes to free</v>

697
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:54.040
<v Speaker 2>to fair use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone just decided to make an </v>

698
00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.970
<v Speaker 2>unbox unboxing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbox therapy channel and all their shit</v>

699
00:33:55.971 --> 00:33:59.240
<v Speaker 2>is just shitting on what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this fucking dummy talking about</v>

700
00:33:59.241 --> 00:34:00.820
<v Speaker 2>watches that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

701
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:05.830
<v Speaker 2>that's not really fair use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're kind of stealing your </v>

702
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.381
<v Speaker 2>content and becoming something with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>content only exclusively or other </v>

703
00:34:08.381 --> 00:34:08.990
<v Speaker 2>people's content.</v>

704
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:10.880
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't really have content </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

705
00:34:10.881 --> 00:34:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Content is other people's content and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a few layers deep on that.</v>

706
00:34:15.141 --> 00:34:20.141
<v Speaker 2>And you realize it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of a fucked up scenario and </v>

707
00:34:20.141 --> 00:34:23.920
<v Speaker 2>you wonder about what it breeds like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this issue with the,</v>

708
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:25.790
<v Speaker 2>the fine brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know who they are?</v>

709
00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:27.810
<v Speaker 2>The fine brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard the woo hoo.</v>

710
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.050
<v Speaker 2>So they have just really popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel,</v>

711
00:34:30.051 --> 00:34:32.510
<v Speaker 2>maybe like 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11,</v>

712
00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.400
<v Speaker 2>12 million subscribers or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

713
00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they do react videos.</v>

714
00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:37.140
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

715
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:38.720
<v Speaker 2>so they watched something and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>react to it?</v>

716
00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:39.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

717
00:34:39.171 --> 00:34:39.350
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

718
00:34:39.351 --> 00:34:41.420
<v Speaker 2>They don't personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have people on.</v>

719
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:46.450
<v Speaker 2>So it'd be like kids react that it'll be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like grandparents react and then it'll </v>

720
00:34:46.791 --> 00:34:49.700
<v Speaker 2>be like famous youtubers react or </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes react,</v>

721
00:34:49.701 --> 00:34:53.540
<v Speaker 2>somebody reacting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but essentially the core of their being,</v>

722
00:34:53.541 --> 00:34:54.710
<v Speaker 2>they've been doing this for a long time.</v>

723
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:59.710
<v Speaker 2>The core aspect of the model is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this thing you're reacting to </v>

724
00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.130
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a viral video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a trend,</v>

725
00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:06.310
<v Speaker 2>whatever it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While recently they tried to trademark </v>

726
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:12.250
<v Speaker 2>the term react so that anybody who </v>
<v Speaker 2>uploaded a video with the term react in </v>

727
00:35:12.531 --> 00:35:15.350
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they could claim it and earn the ad</v>

728
00:35:15.351 --> 00:35:17.480
<v Speaker 2>revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

729
00:35:17.481 --> 00:35:20.920
<v Speaker 2>they must be stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do know about this,</v>

730
00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to,</v>

731
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:27.140
<v Speaker 2>I think I told you about this at one </v>
<v Speaker 2>point when it first maybe like started </v>

732
00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:30.371
<v Speaker 2>online chat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of fucking cunt thinks that they </v>

733
00:35:30.371 --> 00:35:33.791
<v Speaker 2>can own the word sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they launched this video so they </v>

734
00:35:33.791 --> 00:35:34.330
<v Speaker 2>launched this video where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

735
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.310
<v Speaker 2>where essentially they're explaining how</v>
<v Speaker 2>this process will work for people.</v>

736
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:43.460
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're telling you that like you can </v>

737
00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:43.890
<v Speaker 2>sign up with us today and we'll license </v>
<v Speaker 2>will license it back to you.</v>

738
00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:47.850
<v Speaker 2>So you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who the fuck are these guys?</v>

739
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:52.490
<v Speaker 2>So they're out of their fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are out of their fucking money,</v>

740
00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 2>but here it gets better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

741
00:35:53.941 --> 00:35:55.830
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real quick.</v>

742
00:35:55.831 --> 00:36:00.831
<v Speaker 2>They're not the only ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's other companies out there </v>

743
00:36:00.831 --> 00:36:00.840
<v Speaker 2>that have already been doing this in </v>
<v Speaker 2>quiet.</v>

744
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:06.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a company called Juke and media </v>

745
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.630
<v Speaker 2>and there was a story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>

746
00:36:07.631 --> 00:36:08.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was his name?</v>

747
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Devin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Supertramp.</v>

748
00:36:10.081 --> 00:36:13.560
<v Speaker 2>He makes like action action videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you would call them.</v>

749
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Action Videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

750
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:20.510
<v Speaker 2>He used,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used a title called people are </v>

751
00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:23.391
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the title of his video for his </v>

752
00:36:23.391 --> 00:36:23.391
<v Speaker 2>demo reel for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that.</v>

753
00:36:23.391 --> 00:36:24.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

754
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:28.220
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't know that you can mediate,</v>

755
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:32.070
<v Speaker 2>had already trademarked that title.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are awesome.</v>

756
00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.250
<v Speaker 2>They own it and have our own people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

757
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

758
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Because whoever's got enough money to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay the right lawyer,</v>

759
00:36:40.411 --> 00:36:42.590
<v Speaker 2>God knows how it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

760
00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.170
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

761
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:46.410
<v Speaker 2>the idea that you can trademark those </v>
<v Speaker 2>three words together,</v>

762
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:51.650
<v Speaker 2>that is so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were able to issue a copyright </v>

763
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:53.400
<v Speaker 2>pulled down on his video and oh my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

764
00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:57.270
<v Speaker 2>and so that was acting as his demo reel </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get jobs and stuff like that.</v>

765
00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:01.140
<v Speaker 2>And so he did a follow up kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining what had happened.</v>

766
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.220
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

767
00:37:02.221 --> 00:37:07.221
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting back to kind of the drama </v>

768
00:37:07.221 --> 00:37:08.991
<v Speaker 2>component,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like people are kind of looking at </v>

769
00:37:08.991 --> 00:37:08.991
<v Speaker 2>youtube now a little differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like wow,</v>

770
00:37:08.991 --> 00:37:13.620
<v Speaker 2>maybe here's this completely open space </v>
<v Speaker 2>where people were allowed to do whatever</v>

771
00:37:13.621 --> 00:37:14.640
<v Speaker 2>they wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

772
00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.440
<v Speaker 2>what are the consequences of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

773
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:22.470
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're putting out a certain type of </v>

774
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.470
<v Speaker 2>frequency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

775
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you're putting out.</v>

776
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:25.881
<v Speaker 2>If you're putting out a frequency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying is you want to own </v>

777
00:37:25.881 --> 00:37:26.340
<v Speaker 2>all the react videos.</v>

778
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:31.550
<v Speaker 2>That's the greedy can frequency </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the greedy combat bat signal </v>

779
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:33.390
<v Speaker 2>and you're letting everybody know you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>a piece of shit.</v>

780
00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:35.700
<v Speaker 2>You're a piece of shit and you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>steal money.</v>

781
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

782
00:37:36.211 --> 00:37:38.010
<v Speaker 2>the best part is that stealing money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

783
00:37:38.011 --> 00:37:38.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's stealing money.</v>

784
00:37:38.941 --> 00:37:41.160
<v Speaker 2>If you make a reaction video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to watch two girls,</v>

785
00:37:41.161 --> 00:37:43.710
<v Speaker 2>one cup or guy getting run over by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>buffalo,</v>

786
00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.070
<v Speaker 2>they want money from you watching that </v>
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>

787
00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:52.340
<v Speaker 2>that stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they've done is they've used </v>

788
00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:54.561
<v Speaker 2>lawyers to circumvent the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've jacked the system and they're </v>

789
00:37:54.561 --> 00:37:58.521
<v Speaker 2>going to try to steal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have they actually copyrighted the word </v>

790
00:37:58.521 --> 00:37:58.521
<v Speaker 2>react.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is this valid?</v>

791
00:37:58.521 --> 00:37:59.040
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

792
00:37:59.041 --> 00:38:00.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they retracted.</v>

793
00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:04.110
<v Speaker 2>What happened was the Internet lost its </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit as you would expect.</v>

794
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:09.470
<v Speaker 2>And these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were videos on youtube which were </v>

795
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:12.501
<v Speaker 2>live streams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These were so funny when this was going </v>

796
00:38:12.501 --> 00:38:16.581
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially what they were is the </v>

797
00:38:16.581 --> 00:38:18.501
<v Speaker 2>subscriber count of their channel </v>
<v Speaker 2>shortly after the controversy had hit </v>

798
00:38:18.501 --> 00:38:22.260
<v Speaker 2>and it will just like fell off a cliff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it should go to zero.</v>

799
00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.450
<v Speaker 2>He never went to 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to zero.</v>

800
00:38:24.451 --> 00:38:26.250
<v Speaker 2>It should go to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It never went to zero,</v>

801
00:38:26.251 --> 00:38:29.040
<v Speaker 2>don't deserve anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they want to do.</v>

802
00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:34.250
<v Speaker 2>You really want to reach out to everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>using the word react and the video and </v>

803
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.250
<v Speaker 2>you want money from them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

804
00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.130
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're everything that's</v>

805
00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.470
<v Speaker 3>wrong with distributing content over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>internet.</v>

806
00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:43.650
<v Speaker 3>That's everything that's wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've taken one of the sneakiest most </v>

807
00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:47.220
<v Speaker 3>diabolical fucking tricks and all of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>legal system and you've applied it to </v>

808
00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:50.380
<v Speaker 3>this open free world of the Internet and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a piece of shit.</v>

809
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.020
<v Speaker 3>That's a parasitic behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you something.</v>

810
00:38:53.050 --> 00:38:54.490
<v Speaker 3>That's cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

811
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:57.190
<v Speaker 3>They came back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>retracted it.</v>

812
00:38:57.360 --> 00:39:00.340
<v Speaker 3>Apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck them.</v>

813
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:02.350
<v Speaker 3>Fuck them for even thinking that showed </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

814
00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:07.360
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're going to give them a second </v>

815
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:07.360
<v Speaker 3>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking chances.</v>

816
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:07.960
<v Speaker 3>You can't think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

817
00:39:07.961 --> 00:39:09.370
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do that.</v>

818
00:39:09.371 --> 00:39:14.371
<v Speaker 3>You can't go after people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For some it's not like it has anything </v>

819
00:39:14.371 --> 00:39:14.371
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything that you create,</v>

820
00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:15.850
<v Speaker 3>you're just stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were,</v>

821
00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.780
<v Speaker 3>there were some stories going around </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they had effectively shut down like</v>

822
00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:24.781
<v Speaker 3>these small time channel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walmart completely like people who had </v>

823
00:39:24.781 --> 00:39:24.781
<v Speaker 3>the chance.</v>

824
00:39:24.781 --> 00:39:28.660
<v Speaker 3>Again to define bro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that.</v>

825
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:32.950
<v Speaker 3>Man is probably some lawyer talked him </v>
<v Speaker 3>into doing that is going to be amazing.</v>

826
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:34.200
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got it.</v>

827
00:39:34.201 --> 00:39:37.990
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have the copyright fuckers.</v>

828
00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.840
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so gross.</v>

829
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:46.380
<v Speaker 3>The idea behind going after people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like this something that you </v>

830
00:39:46.451 --> 00:39:51.451
<v Speaker 3>created and you know they came along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something completely unique where you </v>

831
00:39:51.451 --> 00:39:51.520
<v Speaker 3>want to copy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

832
00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:56.530
<v Speaker 3>Then what happened was that they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went so far as trying to go after </v>

833
00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:59.671
<v Speaker 3>ellen because she did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She did reactions on TV.</v>

834
00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.310
<v Speaker 3>Oh mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She would have kids,</v>

835
00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:03.760
<v Speaker 3>kids reacting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know what?</v>

<v Speaker 3>you should go to jail for that.</v>

837
00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:06.940
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucked up.</v>

838
00:40:06.941 --> 00:40:11.941
<v Speaker 3>The whole legal system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have format exist before </v>

839
00:40:11.941 --> 00:40:12.120
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Cosby do that today.</v>

840
00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.190

<v Speaker 3>one cup video,</v>

841
00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:18.910
<v Speaker 3>like in 2003 or way back that Brian and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

842
00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:22.900
<v Speaker 3>It should have copyright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So gross.</v>

843
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:26.720
<v Speaker 3>It's so gross man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway.</v>

844
00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:27.520
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

845
00:40:27.521 --> 00:40:28.960
<v Speaker 3>I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

846
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.540
<v Speaker 3>It's scary both ways because at the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>time you're like,</v>

847
00:40:31.541 --> 00:40:33.370
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you really want youtube to come in as</v>

848
00:40:33.371 --> 00:40:37.210
<v Speaker 3>this massive governing body to stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff like this from happening?</v>

849
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:37.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

850
00:40:37.841 --> 00:40:39.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

851
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:40.480
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

852
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.310
<v Speaker 3>There's some clear cut shit like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>word react.</v>

853
00:40:43.311 --> 00:40:45.760
<v Speaker 3>You can't use react or people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>

854
00:40:45.761 --> 00:40:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

855
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.240
<v Speaker 3>People are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still there and still functioning.</v>

856
00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:52.480
<v Speaker 3>If we titled this video right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are awesome.</v>

857
00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:53.550
<v Speaker 3>We're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take it down.</v>

858
00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:56.500
<v Speaker 3>They're ripping us down instantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't seem right to me.</v>

859
00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:01.530
<v Speaker 3>That's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like saying love the copywriting,</v>

860
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.900
<v Speaker 3>the word love or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or action.</v>

861
00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are off,</v>

862
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:07.450
<v Speaker 3>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't designate.</v>

863
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:11.860
<v Speaker 3>People have said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Disney copyright a happy birthday.</v>

864
00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:14.200
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well happy birthday to you.</v>

865
00:41:14.201 --> 00:41:16.990
<v Speaker 3>The song was copy written for a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

866
00:41:16.991 --> 00:41:21.991
<v Speaker 3>but it's since been dissolved now </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he used to go to a restaurant </v>

867
00:41:21.991 --> 00:41:22.870
<v Speaker 3>and they used to have to sing their own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like happy,</v>

868
00:41:22.871 --> 00:41:27.871
<v Speaker 3>happy birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't sing happy birthday to a </v>

869
00:41:27.871 --> 00:41:31.300
<v Speaker 3>song that we all know the iconic song.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody owned it.</v>

870
00:41:31.301 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 3>So if you wanted to sing that song in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your restaurant when someone came</v>

871
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.420
<v Speaker 5>in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were celebrating a birthday,</v>

872
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:39.140
<v Speaker 5>you would actually get fined.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd actually have to pay money.</v>

873
00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:40.680
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

874
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:46.630
<v Speaker 2>just because we're on the topic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel in general about like </v>

875
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:48.770
<v Speaker 2>digital rights and whatnot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like are you,</v>

876
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:53.900
<v Speaker 2>are you really fancy about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like let's say you had some content.</v>

877
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:56.600
<v Speaker 2>I know you sometimes you have like </v>
<v Speaker 2>musicians on here,</v>

878
00:41:56.601 --> 00:41:59.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they kind of seem to me to be like a</v>

879
00:41:59.121 --> 00:42:02.390
<v Speaker 2>little bit out of touch with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet space.</v>

880
00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm just wondering like if a person </v>

881
00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.070
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

882
00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:13.180
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is purchasing or streaming or buying </v>

883
00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.690
<v Speaker 2>something that somebody's trying to sell</v>
<v Speaker 2>digitally,</v>

884
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.590
<v Speaker 2>do you like how do you feel about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that,</v>

885
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:21.530
<v Speaker 2>how do you think that should work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Selling things digitally well,</v>

886
00:42:21.531 --> 00:42:26.531
<v Speaker 2>like let's say for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had a record and you and you found </v>

887
00:42:26.531 --> 00:42:26.570
<v Speaker 2>out that a bunch of people were pirating</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

888
00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:29.330
<v Speaker 2>Would you go at how hard would you be </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to go after them?</v>

889
00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

890
00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:35.090
<v Speaker 5>see,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it completely depends upon whether or </v>

891
00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:35.640
<v Speaker 5>not what your business is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>

892
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:40.810
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my feeling is that one of the things </v>

893
00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:42.240
<v Speaker 5>about music and you could use the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>argument for standup comedy,</v>

894
00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:45.690
<v Speaker 5>is that pirating in a lot of ways </v>
<v Speaker 5>empowers people.</v>

895
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:49.290
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when someone puts up my stand up on</v>

896
00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:54.320
<v Speaker 5>their youtube channel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not into taking that down because I </v>

897
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.840
<v Speaker 5>think that even when I was selling it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just not.</v>

898
00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:59.790
<v Speaker 5>I'm not into taking that down and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>reason being is because I think the more</v>

899
00:42:59.791 --> 00:43:04.791
<v Speaker 5>people see it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more people will come to see your </v>

900
00:43:04.791 --> 00:43:06.891
<v Speaker 5>live shows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more people will come to support </v>

901
00:43:06.891 --> 00:43:09.651
<v Speaker 5>your standup,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's on Netflix or comedy </v>

902
00:43:09.651 --> 00:43:09.651
<v Speaker 5>central or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'll pay more attention to it.</v>

903
00:43:09.651 --> 00:43:14.121
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a way it's kind of free advertising </v>

904
00:43:14.121 --> 00:43:16.580
<v Speaker 5>in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Music companies don't tend to think </v>

905
00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:20.991
<v Speaker 5>about it that way and we had a recent </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem that was pretty fucking </v>

906
00:43:20.991 --> 00:43:20.991
<v Speaker 5>disgusting.</v>

907
00:43:20.991 --> 00:43:22.260
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we had an act on and uh,</v>

908
00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:27.320
<v Speaker 5>the musical act played the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we played a small section of one of </v>

909
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:31.190
<v Speaker 5>their songs and then the music company </v>
<v Speaker 5>that own that section,</v>

910
00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:35.970
<v Speaker 5>the song wanted all the ad rights for </v>
<v Speaker 5>our show for that episode.</v>

911
00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:37.290
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

912
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:39.600
<v Speaker 5>we contacted the artist and the artist </v>
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>

913
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:41.160
<v Speaker 5>well I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll get that taken care of.</v>

914
00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:46.490
<v Speaker 5>The music companies decision was no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just tell them to not dispute the claim </v>

915
00:43:46.591 --> 00:43:48.870
<v Speaker 5>and we'll take the ad revenue and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>it will be fine.</v>

916
00:43:48.871 --> 00:43:51.300
<v Speaker 5>We won't take down the video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You won't take down the,</v>

917
00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:56.310
<v Speaker 5>it's a fucking three hour video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We paid 15 seconds of a song and you </v>

918
00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:56.940
<v Speaker 5>want all the ad revenue,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>

919
00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.110
<v Speaker 5>And I told them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

920
00:43:58.111 --> 00:44:00.060
<v Speaker 5>look dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get this taken care of her.</v>

921
00:44:00.061 --> 00:44:01.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to delete the episode.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go Fuck Yourself.</v>

922
00:44:01.981 --> 00:44:03.060
<v Speaker 5>Like this is ridiculous.</v>

923
00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:08.420
<v Speaker 5>Like that's some greedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sneaky bullshit that record companies </v>

924
00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:12.530
<v Speaker 5>are still trying to do because record </v>
<v Speaker 5>companies have to justify the fact </v>

925
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:13.890
<v Speaker 5>they've got x amount of employees and a </v>
<v Speaker 5>giant building on sunset.</v>

926
00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:15.630
<v Speaker 5>You don't need that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

927
00:44:15.631 --> 00:44:17.190
<v Speaker 5>You're building.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your Business is dead.</v>

928
00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:18.900
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's sorry,</v>

929
00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:20.670
<v Speaker 5>but this is what you got.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got itunes,</v>

930
00:44:20.671 --> 00:44:22.170
<v Speaker 5>music,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Google play,</v>

931
00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.540
<v Speaker 5>and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>

932
00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:26.640
<v Speaker 5>That's your business.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now the real business is artists getting</v>

933
00:44:26.641 --> 00:44:29.670
<v Speaker 5>their shit out on youtube and on on </v>
<v Speaker 5>social media,</v>

934
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:32.940
<v Speaker 5>and then doing concerts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's where they make the bulk of their</v>

935
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:33.890
<v Speaker 5>money.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The map.</v>

936
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:38.990
<v Speaker 5>They used to be the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He used to be artists made the bulk of </v>

937
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:41.751
<v Speaker 5>their money from the record sales and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then they made some of the money from </v>

938
00:44:41.751 --> 00:44:43.590
<v Speaker 5>concerts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what happens was the record companies</v>

939
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:48.591
<v Speaker 5>would rip them off for record sales and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they would come up with all these </v>

940
00:44:48.591 --> 00:44:50.760
<v Speaker 5>elaborate accounting methods too fake to</v>
<v Speaker 5>to fix the,</v>

941
00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:51.540
<v Speaker 5>the profit.</v>

942
00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:56.660
<v Speaker 5>So that made it look like all their </v>
<v Speaker 5>expenses had to be paid first before </v>

943
00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.980
<v Speaker 5>they counted the profit that they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>take into consideration.</v>

944
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:02.580
<v Speaker 5>The artists learning how to play,</v>
<v Speaker 5>going on the road,</v>

945
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:07.700
<v Speaker 5>doing all these gigs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>creating this song all the time spent </v>

946
00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.400
<v Speaker 5>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't take that into consideration,</v>

947
00:45:08.401 --> 00:45:11.640
<v Speaker 5>but they do calculate all their </v>
<v Speaker 5>employees,</v>

948
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:14.340
<v Speaker 5>all their expenses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all their advertising revenue,</v>

949
00:45:14.341 --> 00:45:16.020
<v Speaker 5>how much it costs to rent their </v>
<v Speaker 5>building,</v>

950
00:45:16.021 --> 00:45:21.021
<v Speaker 5>how much it costs for insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much it costs for errors and </v>

951
00:45:21.021 --> 00:45:24.261
<v Speaker 5>omissions insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all those different things they do take </v>

952
00:45:24.261 --> 00:45:24.900
<v Speaker 5>into account before you get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the artists,</v>

953
00:45:24.901 --> 00:45:29.310
<v Speaker 5>we're fucked like there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>artists that got unbelievably bad record</v>

954
00:45:29.311 --> 00:45:34.311
<v Speaker 5>deals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the reason why prince had changed </v>

955
00:45:34.311 --> 00:45:35.460
<v Speaker 5>his name to a symbol because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking owned his name,</v>

956
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:40.910
<v Speaker 5>so that crafty bastard just decided to </v>
<v Speaker 5>make his name some sort of a weird </v>

957
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:44.961
<v Speaker 5>symbol and become the artist formerly </v>
<v Speaker 5>known as Prince and they couldn't do </v>

958
00:45:44.961 --> 00:45:44.961
<v Speaker 5>shit about it.</v>

959
00:45:44.961 --> 00:45:46.050
<v Speaker 5>It was a really clever workaround for </v>
<v Speaker 5>prints,</v>

960
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:51.330
<v Speaker 5>but it was essentially in response to </v>
<v Speaker 5>these devious practices by these fucking</v>

961
00:45:51.331 --> 00:45:52.170
<v Speaker 5>record companies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

962
00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:55.920
<v Speaker 5>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think like if someone,</v>

963
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:59.670
<v Speaker 5>if you have an album and everybody loves</v>
<v Speaker 5>it and then people start pirating it and</v>

964
00:45:59.671 --> 00:46:02.160
<v Speaker 5>then it gets all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like some musicians.</v>

965
00:46:02.161 --> 00:46:04.980
<v Speaker 5>I had Paul Stanley from kiss and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard that one.</v>

966
00:46:04.981 --> 00:46:07.650
<v Speaker 5>That's kind of what I'm referencing is </v>
<v Speaker 5>super adamant about it.</v>

967
00:46:07.651 --> 00:46:09.730
<v Speaker 5>But he's so old school man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He sold,</v>

968
00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.720
<v Speaker 5>squeezed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>super adamant about it that it's still,</v>

969
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:14.870
<v Speaker 5>I get this vibe from those conversations</v>
<v Speaker 5>that like,</v>

970
00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:18.030
<v Speaker 5>it's almost like these people are kind </v>
<v Speaker 5>of.</v>

971
00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:23.310
<v Speaker 5>They're wishing that an ecosystem </v>
<v Speaker 5>existed still.</v>

972
00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:29.020
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well he made fucking hundreds of </v>

973
00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:29.020
<v Speaker 5>millions of dollars through that </v>
<v Speaker 5>ecosystem.</v>

974
00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:33.290
<v Speaker 5>But I think the truth is the hard truth </v>
<v Speaker 5>is that at least on the economic side,</v>

975
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:37.230
<v Speaker 5>music isn't worth what it used to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>worth.</v>

976
00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:38.580
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

977
00:46:38.581 --> 00:46:41.540
<v Speaker 5>and I don't like saying that because to </v>
<v Speaker 5>me it matters and like I,</v>

978
00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:46.460
<v Speaker 5>I engage with it and it hasn't like an a</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a non economic weight.</v>

979
00:46:46.461 --> 00:46:51.461
<v Speaker 5>It might mean more than ever now that </v>
<v Speaker 5>more people have access to it and you </v>

980
00:46:51.461 --> 00:46:53.790
<v Speaker 5>can be exposed to so much more of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But unlike a purse song basis,</v>

981
00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:59.280
<v Speaker 5>it's a supply and demand situation now </v>
<v Speaker 5>of we have an abundance of potential </v>

982
00:46:59.551 --> 00:47:04.551
<v Speaker 5>music to interact with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's no way that each song can </v>

983
00:47:04.551 --> 00:47:04.551
<v Speaker 5>possibly be worth what it used to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>worth.</v>

984
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:10.430
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no way because it's so easy to </v>

985
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:10.430
<v Speaker 5>access now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one thing.</v>

986
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:14.601
<v Speaker 5>And the other thing is the sheer numbers</v>
<v Speaker 5>of songs that get put out every day,</v>

987
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:19.530
<v Speaker 5>they all exist now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could go back and listen to some Roy</v>

988
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:24.530
<v Speaker 5>orbison from the 19 fifties or you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>listen to some shit that some new band </v>

989
00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:25.020
<v Speaker 5>that you haven't heard of just put out </v>
<v Speaker 5>last week.</v>

990
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.920
<v Speaker 5>They haven't stopped making bands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They haven't stopped making music.</v>

991
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:34.320
<v Speaker 5>It's all just adding up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So let's say collective pilar music is </v>

992
00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:34.320
<v Speaker 5>massive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say</v>

993
00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:39.110
<v Speaker 2>accelerating because the barrier to </v>
<v Speaker 2>entry in actually creating continues to </v>

994
00:47:39.841 --> 00:47:40.710
<v Speaker 2>be lowered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

995
00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.450
<v Speaker 2>Like actually the equipment you need</v>

996
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:43.790
<v Speaker 5>laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's it.</v>

997
00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:48.100
<v Speaker 5>No laptop microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you can create music on Garageband,</v>

998
00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:50.750
<v Speaker 5>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you really can create a good.</v>

999
00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:52.070
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever heard of tone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Netta?</v>

1000
00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.140
<v Speaker 5>You to Annetta?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No tone.</v>

1001
00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:59.180
<v Speaker 5>That is an interesting cat man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's a guy who lives in Toronto and cool</v>

1002
00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:05.600
<v Speaker 5>link up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like this weird androgynous guy in </v>

1003
00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:10.331
<v Speaker 5>his fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got a kid who makes his own music </v>

1004
00:48:10.331 --> 00:48:12.800
<v Speaker 5>and he got famous for these songs on </v>
<v Speaker 5>Youtube.</v>

1005
00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:17.980
<v Speaker 5>This is a him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He makes these videos were just puts up </v>

1006
00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:22.770
<v Speaker 5>a curtain behind him and he makes these </v>
<v Speaker 5>youtube videos and he sings these songs </v>

1007
00:48:23.781 --> 00:48:25.580
<v Speaker 5>and some of them are fucking good,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1008
00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:30.970
<v Speaker 5>pull up a really big cock that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's one of my favorite place to </v>

1009
00:48:32.961 --> 00:48:34.130
<v Speaker 5>start.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing,</v>

1010
00:48:34.131 --> 00:48:36.350
<v Speaker 5>it sounds like ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1011
00:48:36.351 --> 00:48:39.820
<v Speaker 5>But it's actually a cool song.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1012
00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:40.600
<v Speaker 5>listen to the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>

1013
00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:42.110
<v Speaker 5>let's play it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Give me some volume.</v>

1014
00:48:42.111 --> 00:48:42.410
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>

1015
00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:47.110
<v Speaker 6>look at this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no money in this forum.</v>

1016
00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:48.900
<v Speaker 6>It was just some Weirdo hanging out.</v>

1017
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:11.530
<v Speaker 5>Good songs.</v>

1018
00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:16.190
<v Speaker 5>So of baseline.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But look at this video.</v>

1019
00:49:16.191 --> 00:49:21.191
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this could not be any more geo </v>

1020
00:49:21.191 --> 00:49:22.560
<v Speaker 5>cities.com.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is so low rent.</v>

1021
00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:27.530
<v Speaker 5>He does it in his apartment in Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just has a camera pointed at him,</v>

1022
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:32.770
<v Speaker 5>like really primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got a bunch of different weird </v>

1023
00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:36.100
<v Speaker 5>dresses and he puts on outfits and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>just really strange.</v>

1024
00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:40.130
<v Speaker 5>But this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he does it all himself and he's got this</v>

1025
00:49:40.131 --> 00:49:43.390
<v Speaker 5>massive cult following from doing this </v>
<v Speaker 5>all himself.</v>

1026
00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:45.350
<v Speaker 5>I bought his vinyl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have A.</v>

1027
00:49:45.351 --> 00:49:50.351
<v Speaker 5>I owned this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I bought it on itunes and I bought the </v>

1028
00:49:50.351 --> 00:49:50.351
<v Speaker 5>vinyl of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Support</v>

1029
00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.820
<v Speaker 2>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great point you make there.</v>

1030
00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.700
<v Speaker 2>I remember reading something recently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't quote me,</v>

1031
00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the figures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that artists,</v>

1032
00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:01.250
<v Speaker 2>a lot of artists are actually making </v>
<v Speaker 2>more off the vinyl than they are off the</v>

1033
00:50:01.251 --> 00:50:06.251
<v Speaker 2>digital even though the volume is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much lower just because the actual per </v>

1034
00:50:06.251 --> 00:50:09.971
<v Speaker 2>unit cost is so high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like big bands are doing special </v>

1035
00:50:09.971 --> 00:50:14.081
<v Speaker 2>edition releases on vinyl and such to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of get back some of that lost </v>

1036
00:50:14.301 --> 00:50:17.060
<v Speaker 2>revenue that's existed because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>digital.</v>

1037
00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:22.360
<v Speaker 2>So that's an interesting angle to take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think people are like you where </v>

1038
00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:22.360
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1039
00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.420
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of almost doing it.</v>

1040
00:50:23.421 --> 00:50:25.400
<v Speaker 2>Not because you really need to have it </v>
<v Speaker 2>on vinyl,</v>

1041
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:27.660
<v Speaker 2>but because you want to support </v>
<v Speaker 2>something you like a.</v>

1042
00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:32.720
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a small percentage of </v>

1043
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:32.720
<v Speaker 2>people that do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people,</v>

1044
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:32.960
<v Speaker 2>if they can get it for free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get it for free because most people</v>

1045
00:50:32.961 --> 00:50:34.700
<v Speaker 2>are constantly worried about their </v>
<v Speaker 2>bills,</v>

1046
00:50:34.980 --> 00:50:39.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you can get something for free </v>

1047
00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:40.010
<v Speaker 2>and download it and no one's watching,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that totally makes sense.</v>

1048
00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Artist making more of vinyl sales.</v>

1049
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:46.960
<v Speaker 2>The streaming services.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the article will streaming services </v>

1050
00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:46.960
<v Speaker 2>are the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are they?</v>

1051
00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:51.820
<v Speaker 2>They are and here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're owned by the record companies </v>

1052
00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:52.790
<v Speaker 2>and they have circumvented the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling album system.</v>

1053
00:50:52.791 --> 00:50:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is it,</v>

1054
00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:59.360
<v Speaker 2>isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it the demand from the customer </v>

1055
00:50:59.360 --> 00:50:59.360
<v Speaker 2>that is always going to drive the </v>
<v Speaker 2>marketplace.</v>

1056
00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:02.330
<v Speaker 2>If people want streaming services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry to break it to you.</v>

1057
00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:06.110
<v Speaker 2>That's the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have what they want free money to.</v>

1058
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:08.180
<v Speaker 2>If you could just hand out from under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be great as well.</v>

1059
00:51:08.181 --> 00:51:10.760
<v Speaker 2>But I mean in this particular case with </v>
<v Speaker 2>music,</v>

1060
00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:16.200
<v Speaker 2>doesn't music work better when you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>just launch any source process on the </v>

1061
00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:20.230
<v Speaker 2>planet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Streaming services are profitable and </v>

1062
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:22.661
<v Speaker 2>they're making a lot of money now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The streaming services are making a lot </v>

1063
00:51:22.661 --> 00:51:25.211
<v Speaker 2>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The artists aren't making artists and </v>

1064
00:51:25.211 --> 00:51:25.211
<v Speaker 2>artist doesn't need to be on spotify </v>
<v Speaker 2>plant.</v>

1065
00:51:25.211 --> 00:51:26.500
<v Speaker 2>There are plenty of examples of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who pulled their stuff.</v>

1066
00:51:26.501 --> 00:51:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I'll spot Taylor swift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1067
00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:30.710
<v Speaker 2>my podcast won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't put my pipe.</v>

1068
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:31.700
<v Speaker 2>That's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:51:31.701 --> 00:51:36.701
<v Speaker 2>Well it's because of the amount of money</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they pay you is fucking </v>

1070
00:51:36.701 --> 00:51:36.701
<v Speaker 2>ridiculously low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1071
00:51:36.701 --> 00:51:37.640
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taylor swift pull that shit off.</v>

1072
00:51:37.641 --> 00:51:42.641
<v Speaker 2>Spotify when you get a big art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like Taylor swift pulling their </v>

1073
00:51:42.641 --> 00:51:42.641
<v Speaker 2>shit off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spotify,</v>

1074
00:51:42.641 --> 00:51:43.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much you made off </v>
<v Speaker 2>spotify.</v>

1075
00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:48.260
<v Speaker 2>The figures maybe could discuss a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>million or something,</v>

1076
00:51:48.261 --> 00:51:50.160
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she didn't make a couple of minutes.</v>

1077
00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Maybe 500,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe $500,000.</v>

1078
00:51:52.271 --> 00:51:52.620
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1079
00:51:52.621 --> 00:51:53.870
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was so low.</v>

1080
00:51:53.871 --> 00:51:58.871
<v Speaker 2>It was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's somewhere in there waiting </v>

1081
00:51:58.871 --> 00:52:02.360
<v Speaker 2>for the biggest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the biggest artists that exists </v>

1082
00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:02.360
<v Speaker 2>on the platform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1083
00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.060
<v Speaker 2>there was like we went over this before </v>
<v Speaker 2>where we put.</v>

1084
00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:09.130
<v Speaker 2>We looked at the one song that got </v>
<v Speaker 2>played the most on spotify and how much </v>

1085
00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:11.270
<v Speaker 2>that artists got for it and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>2000 bucks.</v>

1086
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:13.940
<v Speaker 2>A fraction of a penny per play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But see,</v>

1087
00:52:13.941 --> 00:52:18.941
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my feeling though is is the spotify </v>

1088
00:52:18.941 --> 00:52:21.880
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they a crossover of the itunes </v>

1089
00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:21.950
<v Speaker 2>audience or are they a crossover of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pirating audience?</v>

1090
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I think there are radio audience because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like instead of tuning into what </v>

1091
00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:31.871
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying is in the absence of spotify,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did those millions and millions of </v>

1092
00:52:31.871 --> 00:52:35.590
<v Speaker 2>users,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do they turn to itunes and give you the </v>

1093
00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:35.590
<v Speaker 2>ninety nine cents or do they give you </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing?</v>

1094
00:52:35.590 --> 00:52:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Because if they're giving you nothing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stealing it right thing.</v>

1095
00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:41.920
<v Speaker 2>Isn't spotify better than that </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative because at least you,</v>

1096
00:52:41.921 --> 00:52:43.970
<v Speaker 2>if it's the pirating audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

1097
00:52:43.971 --> 00:52:48.971
<v Speaker 2>and this is the fear that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that the music business doesn't </v>

1098
00:52:48.971 --> 00:52:50.180
<v Speaker 2>seem to want to address,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that when napster hit,</v>

1099
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:52.670
<v Speaker 2>everybody was a pirate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care who you are.</v>

1100
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.630
<v Speaker 2>I walked around and talked to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a pirate.</v>

1101
00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:58.370
<v Speaker 2>It was so superior to any other method </v>
<v Speaker 2>for discovering music.</v>

1102
00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:01.100
<v Speaker 2>You even if you wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't want to steal things.</v>

1103
00:53:01.101 --> 00:53:01.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1104
00:53:01.701 --> 00:53:03.020
<v Speaker 2>this is too good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1105
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:06.590
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is this is not pirating </v>
<v Speaker 2>because pirating,</v>

1106
00:53:06.591 --> 00:53:09.530
<v Speaker 2>nobody benefited from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody got free stuff,</v>

1107
00:53:09.531 --> 00:53:14.020
<v Speaker 2>but no one profited with this recording,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these training service three,</v>

1108
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:15.350
<v Speaker 2>would that be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1109
00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.210
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a direct,</v>

1110
00:53:17.211 --> 00:53:18.350
<v Speaker 2>but hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me finish my sentence.</v>

1111
00:53:18.351 --> 00:53:23.351
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead and record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Companies created a platform of </v>

1112
00:53:23.351 --> 00:53:24.530
<v Speaker 2>financially profitable platform to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stream from.</v>

1113
00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 2>That's a big difference between</v>

1114
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:31.250
<v Speaker 3>that and pirating because pirating </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have any central location is </v>

1115
00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:33.690
<v Speaker 3>just they're just floating around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only central location was napster.</v>

1116
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:36.330
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Nat Napster got taken down because of</v>

1117
00:53:36.331 --> 00:53:39.060
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but napster was a really profitable like</v>

1118
00:53:39.061 --> 00:53:44.061
<v Speaker 3>these spotify is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've figured out a way to sort of </v>

1119
00:53:44.061 --> 00:53:44.370
<v Speaker 3>circumvent this whole downloading </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation,</v>

1120
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:47.700
<v Speaker 3>make things streaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stream everything.</v>

1121
00:53:47.701 --> 00:53:52.170
<v Speaker 3>There are alternatives to spotify,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Jay z's service title.</v>

1122
00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:54.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are equally criticized.</v>

1123
00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:59.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>except that one is owned by artists and </v>

1124
00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.010
<v Speaker 3>record labels and they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have similar issues in trying to </v>

1125
00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:03.210
<v Speaker 3>pay actual artists because at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the day,</v>

1126
00:54:03.211 --> 00:54:05.010
<v Speaker 3>if they raise the price of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>service,</v>

1127
00:54:05.250 --> 00:54:09.090
<v Speaker 3>if spotify goes from 10 bucks to 20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people aren't going to have it.</v>

1128
00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:14.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the percentage of people that </v>

1129
00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:14.180
<v Speaker 3>use spotify that actually pay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet it's way less.</v>

1130
00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:17.040
<v Speaker 3>I bet most people get the free spotify </v>
<v Speaker 3>go quite fast.</v>

1131
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:17.960
<v Speaker 3>Majority.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

1132
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:19.740
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that the data is out there.</v>

1133
00:54:19.741 --> 00:54:21.730
<v Speaker 3>It's a good question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think.</v>

1134
00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:26.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people are paying for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess what I'm trying to get back to </v>

1135
00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.020
<v Speaker 3>it was just this idea that music just </v>
<v Speaker 3>simply isn't as valuable as it was and I</v>

1136
00:54:28.021 --> 00:54:30.930
<v Speaker 3>think that it's tough as an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1137
00:54:30.931 --> 00:54:34.850
<v Speaker 3>like I can sense I consent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel the pressure of artists right now</v>

1138
00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:35.850
<v Speaker 3>way you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1139
00:54:35.851 --> 00:54:39.180
<v Speaker 3>I know it's problematic in the way you </v>
<v Speaker 3>economically,</v>

1140
00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.400
<v Speaker 3>economically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying the value,</v>

1141
00:54:41.401 --> 00:54:44.910
<v Speaker 3>the inherent value in expression,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like maybe a better way to say it as the</v>

1142
00:54:44.911 --> 00:54:49.911
<v Speaker 3>market is completely changed and </v>
<v Speaker 3>dissolved there you can see it's not </v>

1143
00:54:49.911 --> 00:54:52.761
<v Speaker 3>that the work is less valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's arguably more valuable and </v>

1144
00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:57.920
<v Speaker 3>troubling times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are certainly troubling times and </v>

1145
00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.160
<v Speaker 3>music is a massive source of info </v>
<v Speaker 3>inspiration and yes,</v>

1146
00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:04.370
<v Speaker 3>and mood and enhancement and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 3>I also occurred it by saying like it's </v>

1147
00:55:04.891 --> 00:55:05.140
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

1148
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:09.660
<v Speaker 3>It's arguably more important emotionally</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the rest of it,</v>

1149
00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:14.960
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just specifically talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I think until I think artists need </v>

1150
00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:19.521
<v Speaker 3>to recognize that and then they can use </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever system comes forth for how to </v>

1151
00:55:19.521 --> 00:55:20.620
<v Speaker 3>deliver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1152
00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:25.650
<v Speaker 3>the future of how we listen to music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least they're involved in that </v>

1153
00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:28.590
<v Speaker 3>process instead of just being like </v>
<v Speaker 3>participating in the current one,</v>

1154
00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:32.690
<v Speaker 3>like it's like you need to be on spotify</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a number of different reasons as an,</v>

1155
00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:35.760
<v Speaker 3>as an emerging artist because that's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way people are discovering music.</v>

1156
00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:38.430
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of pressure there to </v>
<v Speaker 3>participate even in the,</v>

1157
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:42.510
<v Speaker 3>even though you're not getting rewarded </v>
<v Speaker 3>for it as an emerging artist,</v>

1158
00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:47.600
<v Speaker 3>but as an artist that already is </v>
<v Speaker 3>established well and established making </v>

1159
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:51.621
<v Speaker 3>money and you realize that spotify needs</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like you in order to legitimize </v>

1160
00:55:51.621 --> 00:55:52.950
<v Speaker 3>its company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it becomes an issue.</v>

1161
00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.320
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1162
00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:57.910
<v Speaker 3>our subscriber growth in the last six </v>
<v Speaker 3>months or two felt it was,</v>

1163
00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:59.040
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1164
00:55:59.340 --> 00:56:02.010
<v Speaker 3>just 10 million paid subscribers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apple music,</v>

1165
00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.380
<v Speaker 3>10 million quota stats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1166
00:56:04.381 --> 00:56:09.381
<v Speaker 3>spotify just crossed $100.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Million total users paying number could </v>

1167
00:56:09.721 --> 00:56:12.510
<v Speaker 3>be more than $30 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't they tell you that?</v>

1168
00:56:12.511 --> 00:56:15.180
<v Speaker 3>But what does that mean though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not a real number.</v>

1169
00:56:15.181 --> 00:56:17.340
<v Speaker 3>They're saying could be more whenever </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone says,</v>

1170
00:56:17.341 --> 00:56:19.410
<v Speaker 3>could be more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be three people,</v>

1171
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:22.350
<v Speaker 3>could be more than $30 million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it could be like five dudes.</v>

1172
00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:26.890
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't spotify announced as $20 million</v>
<v Speaker 3>paying subscriber.</v>

1173
00:56:26.891 --> 00:56:28.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back in June of 2015,</v>

1174
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:34.020
<v Speaker 3>spotify announced as 20 million paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>subscribers with an ad based fee free </v>

1175
00:56:34.211 --> 00:56:36.490
<v Speaker 3>user base of $55 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1176
00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:41.550
<v Speaker 3>That's a pretty 75 million total and $20</v>
<v Speaker 3>million paying subscribers.</v>

1177
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.750
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the problem is to.</v>

1178
00:56:43.751 --> 00:56:48.751
<v Speaker 3>They can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like if you have a podcast on it </v>

1179
00:56:48.751 --> 00:56:48.751
<v Speaker 3>and they can get rid of your ads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they could put their own shit on it.</v>

1180
00:56:48.751 --> 00:56:52.600
<v Speaker 3>They want us and I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not making an argument for spotify.</v>

1181
00:56:52.601 --> 00:56:57.601
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just peaked my interest in a number </v>

1182
00:56:57.601 --> 00:57:00.361
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A number of times that is being </v>

1183
00:57:00.361 --> 00:57:00.361
<v Speaker 3>discussed is like I think yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big artists,</v>

1184
00:57:00.361 --> 00:57:01.730
<v Speaker 3>they can take a stand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taylor swift can take a stand.</v>

1185
00:57:01.731 --> 00:57:03.370
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't need the 500,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>bucks,</v>

1186
00:57:03.371 --> 00:57:05.410
<v Speaker 3>but if you look at those numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those numbers,</v>

1187
00:57:05.411 --> 00:57:06.620
<v Speaker 3>that's a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1188
00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:11.110
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about 75 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so 50,</v>

1189
00:57:11.111 --> 00:57:13.000
<v Speaker 3>whatever they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fifty dollars million.</v>

1190
00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:16.120
<v Speaker 3>They're using ad revenue and then the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other $25 million,</v>

1191
00:57:16.121 --> 00:57:17.870
<v Speaker 3>they're actually paying for the service </v>
<v Speaker 3>and bucks.</v>

1192
00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:23.010
<v Speaker 3>That's an insane amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yet 75 million people paying $10 a </v>

1193
00:57:23.010 --> 00:57:24.370
<v Speaker 3>month,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can see 25 million people paying</v>

1194
00:57:24.371 --> 00:57:28.270
<v Speaker 3>$10 a month and then the other 50 just </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting their ad revenue from.</v>

1195
00:57:28.271 --> 00:57:29.540
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1196
00:57:29.541 --> 00:57:31.380
<v Speaker 3>but you can see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see the breakdown.</v>

1197
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:34.060
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like hand over fist.</v>

1198
00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.880
<v Speaker 3>They're making money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still the record companies,</v>

1199
00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:39.310
<v Speaker 3>the record companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones that are in charge of this,</v>

1200
00:57:39.311 --> 00:57:44.311
<v Speaker 3>like they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're massive contributors to these </v>

1201
00:57:44.311 --> 00:57:44.311
<v Speaker 3>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Companies.</v>

1202
00:57:44.311 --> 00:57:44.311
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

1203
00:57:44.311 --> 00:57:47.320
<v Speaker 3>So they figured out a new way to not pay</v>
<v Speaker 3>artists and to stay open.</v>

1204
00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:48.300
<v Speaker 3>Stay valid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1205
00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:53.320
<v Speaker 3>Artists appear to be people that get </v>
<v Speaker 3>taken advantage of have been for the </v>

1206
00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.930
<v Speaker 3>last 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay z things,</v>

1207
00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:59.940
<v Speaker 3>a great thing to have artists doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but see he see he was charging more and,</v>

1208
00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.590
<v Speaker 3>and that's why their user base there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're in trouble.</v>

1209
00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:04.360
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he apparently they're in trouble because</v>

1210
00:58:04.361 --> 00:58:09.361
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't build a substantial user </v>
<v Speaker 3>base at the cost they wanted to get he </v>

1211
00:58:09.361 --> 00:58:09.361
<v Speaker 3>charging well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it,</v>

1212
00:58:09.361 --> 00:58:10.160
<v Speaker 3>like 20 bucks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1213
00:58:10.161 --> 00:58:15.161
<v Speaker 3>but a higher quality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're getting to your higher quality </v>

1214
00:58:15.161 --> 00:58:15.161
<v Speaker 3>audio.</v>

1215
00:58:15.161 --> 00:58:15.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lossless audio,</v>

1216
00:58:15.431 --> 00:58:18.880
<v Speaker 3>higher quality audio 20 people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>care about that though,</v>

1217
00:58:18.881 --> 00:58:23.500
<v Speaker 3>which is the issue it for free or get </v>
<v Speaker 3>they just get the 3:20</v>

1218
00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.420
<v Speaker 3>kilobyte because I can't hear the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>

1219
00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:30.890
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I had an amp once that I attached </v>

1220
00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:32.080
<v Speaker 3>to my ipod.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had an ipod and an ipad amp.</v>

1221
00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:33.610
<v Speaker 3>I set it up once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never using it again.</v>

1222
00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:36.610
<v Speaker 3>It was bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's barely better.</v>

1223
00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:37.690
<v Speaker 3>Convenience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1224
00:58:37.691 --> 00:58:39.610
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Convenience.</v>

1225
00:58:39.611 --> 00:58:41.860
<v Speaker 3>In many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump's quality.</v>

1226
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:45.130
<v Speaker 3>The trumps your uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's the beauty of itunes.</v>

1227
00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:47.380
<v Speaker 3>And then apple's music streaming </v>
<v Speaker 3>service.</v>

1228
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:49.450
<v Speaker 3>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the case of Itunes,</v>

1229
00:58:49.451 --> 00:58:54.451
<v Speaker 3>you can make the argument like apples </v>
<v Speaker 3>then involved in the promotion of your </v>

1230
00:58:54.451 --> 00:58:54.451
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1231
00:58:54.451 --> 00:58:58.291
<v Speaker 3>Because they're getting a huge chunk of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest distribution of music right </v>

1232
00:58:58.291 --> 00:58:58.720
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you wouldn't break it down that way,</v>

1233
00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:01.000
<v Speaker 3>no cds are being sold at like best buy.</v>

1234
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.460
<v Speaker 3>Unless you can really search really hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>and find the one best.</v>

1235
00:59:03.461 --> 00:59:08.461
<v Speaker 3>Buy The house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know who the fuck has cds anymore </v>

1236
00:59:08.461 --> 00:59:10.840
<v Speaker 3>through a Ct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a white stripe cd in my office </v>

1237
00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:10.840
<v Speaker 3>that was cleaning out my office and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was sitting on my desk.</v>

1238
00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:10.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna.</v>

1239
00:59:10.901 --> 00:59:12.760
<v Speaker 3>Throw this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have it on my phone.</v>

1240
00:59:12.761 --> 00:59:17.761
<v Speaker 3>Why would I want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a stupid copy of it that I'm not </v>

1241
00:59:17.761 --> 00:59:17.761
<v Speaker 3>going to plug in and where's the thought</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that?</v>

1242
00:59:17.761 --> 00:59:19.690
<v Speaker 3>I've been having a lot recently because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen some things happen.</v>

1243
00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.920
<v Speaker 3>If all of the musiC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like let's say</v>

1244
00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:23.930
<v Speaker 8>speak your 10 favorite albums of all </v>
<v Speaker 8>time,</v>

1245
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:27.350
<v Speaker 8>you Don't have them a physical copy of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you have like the.</v>

1246
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:30.230
<v Speaker 8>You have them saved on your apple music,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever it is,</v>

1247
00:59:30.231 --> 00:59:32.750
<v Speaker 8>whatever service you pick,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if it's all in the cloud,</v>

1248
00:59:33.710 --> 00:59:37.220
<v Speaker 8>they can technically go change that </v>
<v Speaker 8>music whenever they choose to change it.</v>

1249
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:42.430
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Kanye west has been doing some really </v>

1250
00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:44.261
<v Speaker 8>recently right now where he put out an </v>
<v Speaker 8>album on title last month and for about </v>

1251
00:59:44.261 --> 00:59:46.130
<v Speaker 8>a month they were kind of tweaking it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They were changing the mastering on it.</v>

1252
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:49.370
<v Speaker 8>They were changing the featured artists </v>
<v Speaker 8>on it even on one song.</v>

1253
00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.190
<v Speaker 8>So while it was up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he was tweaking.</v>

1254
00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.440
<v Speaker 8>He's gone back on another album that's </v>
<v Speaker 8>already been out for a long time now and</v>

1255
00:59:54.441 --> 00:59:59.441
<v Speaker 8>change some of the mastering on two of </v>
<v Speaker 8>those songs and some people think he </v>

1256
00:59:59.441 --> 00:59:59.441
<v Speaker 8>might be doing more.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No one knows what,</v>

1257
00:59:59.441 --> 01:00:00.140
<v Speaker 8>but it's a thought that I've been having</v>
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>

1258
01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:05.560
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one of my favorite albums I went to go </v>

1259
01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:05.870
<v Speaker 8>back and find that the track little </v>
<v Speaker 8>orders out of it's out of order now.</v>

1260
01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:11.080
<v Speaker 8>Some of the songs are missing and it's </v>
<v Speaker 8>because that artist has decided not to </v>

1261
01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:14.591
<v Speaker 8>have to the portion of that album up on </v>
<v Speaker 8>I or on spotify the way it originally </v>

1262
01:00:14.591 --> 01:00:15.470
<v Speaker 8>was.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So if you wanted to have that album,</v>

1263
01:00:15.471 --> 01:00:16.940
<v Speaker 8>you need to own It.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The way,</v>

1264
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:21.970
<v Speaker 8>the way he put it out in 2011 where you </v>
<v Speaker 8>never have that actual album you have </v>

1265
01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:27.110
<v Speaker 8>with whatever they have existing in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>cloud and that's some deep shit or </v>

1266
01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:27.260
<v Speaker 8>that's some deep shit.</v>

1267
01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:32.660
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I support someone being able to do that </v>

1268
01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:35.731
<v Speaker 3>because that's kind of interesting like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what he's doing by changing the </v>

1269
01:00:35.731 --> 01:00:36.790
<v Speaker 3>mastering and adding new tracks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking around with things.</v>

1270
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
<v Speaker 3>It actually is compelling like it makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to kind of tune into it and </v>

1271
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.301
<v Speaker 3>it's very intelligent on his part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he does like as dumb as that </v>

1272
01:00:45.301 --> 01:00:46.540
<v Speaker 3>dude is egocentric [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>That dude Is.</v>

1273
01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.630
<v Speaker 3>He's so ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he makes some really good moves.</v>

1274
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:54.750
<v Speaker 3>Like when he goes on this massive rant </v>
<v Speaker 3>about bill cosby being innocent right </v>

1275
01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:56.070
<v Speaker 3>before it releases his shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1276
01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.110
<v Speaker 3>It's a classic role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1277
01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.340
<v Speaker 3>It's a little too much for me most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>

1278
01:01:00.341 --> 01:01:04.060
<v Speaker 3>but he's so entwined in the world of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hate though.</v>

1279
01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:09.100
<v Speaker 3>He has so much hate coming at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It almost makes sense to cultivate that </v>

1280
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.230
<v Speaker 3>hate and use it like judo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which in the right direction.</v>

1281
01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:13.810
<v Speaker 3>He knows what he's doing for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent,</v>

1282
01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:18.900
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happened when he tweets something </v>

1283
01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:18.900
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1284
01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.510
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you really Think he thinks bill </v>

1285
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.510
<v Speaker 3>cosby's in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck outta here.</v>

1286
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:25.501
<v Speaker 3>Nobody thinks bill cosby's innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even bill cosby sitting around with his </v>

1287
01:01:25.501 --> 01:01:25.650
<v Speaker 3>one fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I going,</v>

1288
01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:29.800
<v Speaker 3>maybe I did rape those girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even he Is like coming to terms with the</v>

1289
01:01:29.801 --> 01:01:32.560
<v Speaker 3>fact that you might be a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His wife left him.</v>

1290
01:01:32.561 --> 01:01:33.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean even that crazy wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1291
01:01:33.831 --> 01:01:36.130
<v Speaker 3>his smile through all those interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

1292
01:01:36.131 --> 01:01:38.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm ghost dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's dark.</v>

1293
01:01:38.590 --> 01:01:40.300
<v Speaker 3>you look at those interviews and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch her.</v>

1294
01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Like she's smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She knows,</v>

1295
01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:44.470
<v Speaker 3>she knows something's up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1296
01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:49.500
<v Speaker 3>she's been protected by royalty for so </v>
<v Speaker 3>long because he existed as a celebrity </v>

1297
01:01:49.631 --> 01:01:53.680
<v Speaker 3>in a strange time when an artist can get</v>
<v Speaker 3>away with almost anything.</v>

1298
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:55.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean you Were in a bubble.</v>

1299
01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:58.030
<v Speaker 3>You were different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that being in a bubble.</v>

1300
01:01:58.031 --> 01:02:03.031
<v Speaker 3>And also I think for a guy like you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>I to try to even understand what it's </v>

1301
01:02:03.031 --> 01:02:06.160
<v Speaker 3>like to be as famous as bill cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible.</v>

1302
01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:11.370
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probably an unmanageable </v>
<v Speaker 3>level of fame at a certain point in his </v>

1303
01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:11.370
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1304
01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:15.370
<v Speaker 3>especially when he had bIll cosby </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself and the cosby show and nbc.</v>

1305
01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:20.510
<v Speaker 3>He was fucking royalty man and during </v>
<v Speaker 3>that time he was inviting these girls to</v>

1306
01:02:20.511 --> 01:02:25.511
<v Speaker 3>come over and read scripts and suck his </v>
<v Speaker 3>dick and fucking drugging them and </v>

1307
01:02:25.511 --> 01:02:25.890
<v Speaker 3>they'd wake up with her panties down by </v>
<v Speaker 3>their ankles and,</v>

1308
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:28.350
<v Speaker 3>and their hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They dIdn't know what the fuck was going</v>

1309
01:02:28.351 --> 01:02:31.110
<v Speaker 3>on and he just got away with it over and</v>
<v Speaker 3>over and over again.</v>

1310
01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:33.840
<v Speaker 3>And because he got away with it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the way people treated him,</v>

1311
01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:39.080
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of fostered this rear really </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy sociopathic behavior that he had.</v>

1312
01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.730
<v Speaker 3>Did he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where does that stand?</v>

1313
01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to jail.</v>

1314
01:02:42.931 --> 01:02:43.980
<v Speaker 3>He is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1315
01:02:43.981 --> 01:02:48.981
<v Speaker 3>they're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying him and he's got the </v>

1316
01:02:48.981 --> 01:02:48.981
<v Speaker 3>criminal case is gonna go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go forward.</v>

1317
01:02:48.981 --> 01:02:53.720
<v Speaker 3>The judge already ruled that she had </v>
<v Speaker 3>signed some shit saying that she </v>

1318
01:02:53.761 --> 01:02:58.280
<v Speaker 3>couldn't testIfy against him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that she wouldn't bring charges and that</v>

1319
01:02:58.281 --> 01:03:00.180
<v Speaker 3>she wouldn't reveal the details of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>

1320
01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:02.130
<v Speaker 3>But then she did reveal the details of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the case.</v>

1321
01:03:02.131 --> 01:03:04.260
<v Speaker 3>So you know what he did?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sued her,</v>

1322
01:03:04.410 --> 01:03:09.090
<v Speaker 3>so he's suing her for going back on her </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal because he paid her off.</v>

1323
01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:14.360
<v Speaker 3>I think he paid her like several million</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars to keep her mouth shut and </v>

1324
01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:19.040
<v Speaker 3>because she is now talking about it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's suing her for that money back.</v>

1325
01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:24.120
<v Speaker 3>And the argument was that because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>had made this deal,</v>

1326
01:03:24.270 --> 01:03:29.270
<v Speaker 3>he shouldn't be able to be prosecuted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but unfortunately for him the deal that </v>

1327
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:30.270
<v Speaker 3>he had made was a verbal deal only.</v>

1328
01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:33.630
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing written down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the things that the judge</v>

1329
01:03:33.631 --> 01:03:35.520
<v Speaker 3>had said like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to get this shit written down,</v>

1330
01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:37.380
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to trial.</v>

1331
01:03:37.590 --> 01:03:39.510
<v Speaker 3>So he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to be charged.</v>

1332
01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:44.511
<v Speaker 3>And it was recently announced it over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the last couple of days that they're </v>

1333
01:03:44.511 --> 01:03:48.410
<v Speaker 3>charging him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a criminal case on me and he's </v>

1334
01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:51.501
<v Speaker 3>an old old man with half an eyeball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would that be a jury in that case?</v>

1335
01:03:51.581 --> 01:03:52.950
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or a judge?</v>

1336
01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:58.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very good question because you </v>

1337
01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:58.650
<v Speaker 3>gotta wonder being a juror up against </v>
<v Speaker 3>bill cosby.</v>

1338
01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody would think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's innocent at this point in time.</v>

1339
01:04:01.591 --> 01:04:02.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't think anybody thinks he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>innocent.</v>

1340
01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:08.090
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the water's completely </v>

1341
01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:08.090
<v Speaker 3>tainted in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kanye west,</v>

1342
01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.790
<v Speaker 3>he believes that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in a way what they're doing.</v>

1343
01:04:11.791 --> 01:04:12.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chuck d,</v>

1344
01:04:12.961 --> 01:04:17.520
<v Speaker 3>that was one of the fucking sad as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chuck d was calling him dr cosby.</v>

1345
01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.510
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because of the show.</v>

1346
01:04:21.511 --> 01:04:23.610
<v Speaker 3>Was he a doctor on the show?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he's a doctor,</v>

1347
01:04:23.611 --> 01:04:26.740
<v Speaker 3>lIke an honorary degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They retracted.</v>

1348
01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:30.930
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he was calling from public enemy.</v>

1349
01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:33.000
<v Speaker 3>What does with those titles?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1350
01:04:33.001 --> 01:04:38.001
<v Speaker 3>like you're a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so everywhere you go everyone has to </v>

1351
01:04:38.001 --> 01:04:38.001
<v Speaker 3>call you doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He actually wanted people to call him dr</v>

1352
01:04:38.001 --> 01:04:39.420
<v Speaker 3>cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of his things.</v>

1353
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:41.790
<v Speaker 3>He's so fucking weird guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1354
01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:43.860
<v Speaker 3>I've told this story before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'll say it again just for you.</v>

1355
01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:47.430
<v Speaker 3>There was a show that I did in seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seattle area,</v>

1356
01:04:47.431 --> 01:04:52.431
<v Speaker 3>this casino,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and one of the people that was working </v>

1357
01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:54.390
<v Speaker 3>there said that cosby used to have these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people sit down before the show.</v>

1358
01:04:54.570 --> 01:04:56.870
<v Speaker 3>He had the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the employees like the ushers,</v>

1359
01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.940
<v Speaker 3>the door people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sit down and watch him eat dinner,</v>

1360
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.170
<v Speaker 3>who sit there and eat curry and they had</v>
<v Speaker 3>to watch him stand in the room and watch</v>

1361
01:05:04.171 --> 01:05:05.880
<v Speaker 3>him eat well before the show.</v>

1362
01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:10.330
<v Speaker 3>Watch him watching me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things you want people</v>

1363
01:05:10.331 --> 01:05:15.331
<v Speaker 3>to watch him eat his curry so you'd sit </v>
<v Speaker 3>down there and eat and they would all </v>

1364
01:05:15.331 --> 01:05:15.580
<v Speaker 3>just stand there and say nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't allowed to talk.</v>

1365
01:05:15.790 --> 01:05:20.380
<v Speaker 3>They sit down there and watch them eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he also had security guards tuck him</v>

1366
01:05:20.410 --> 01:05:25.410
<v Speaker 3>in bed at night like you'd go and lay </v>
<v Speaker 3>down in his bed and he wanted them to </v>

1367
01:05:25.410 --> 01:05:25.940
<v Speaker 3>tuck him in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut the lights out.</v>

1368
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:30.040
<v Speaker 3>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this the case of justIce?</v>

1369
01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:35.041
<v Speaker 3>Severely fucked up individual or it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just the case of have a relatively </v>

1370
01:05:35.041 --> 01:05:39.631
<v Speaker 3>normal individual getting fucked up by </v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstances like being this super </v>

1371
01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:45.720
<v Speaker 3>famous theorist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're responsible for getting fucked </v>

1372
01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:48.301
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a normal person and you get </v>

1373
01:05:48.301 --> 01:05:48.301
<v Speaker 3>super famous and you become fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are responsible.</v>

1374
01:05:48.301 --> 01:05:49.720
<v Speaker 3>It's like a high percentage do though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1375
01:05:49.721 --> 01:05:50.650
<v Speaker 3>but not in that way.</v>

1376
01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.440
<v Speaker 3>That's an extreme version.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a different kind of way.</v>

1377
01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:58.500
<v Speaker 3>Ego ego might get in the way and trip </v>
<v Speaker 3>off a lot of people who might trip over </v>

1378
01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.520
<v Speaker 3>the dick of ego.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's comment I saw when,</v>

1379
01:06:00.521 --> 01:06:05.521
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when prince died recently I signed </v>

1380
01:06:05.521 --> 01:06:05.521
<v Speaker 3>infographic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>

1381
01:06:05.521 --> 01:06:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you tweeted it about the average </v>
<v Speaker 3>age of male pop stars when they die.</v>

1382
01:06:09.270 --> 01:06:11.040
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno who tweeted it.</v>

1383
01:06:11.041 --> 01:06:14.830
<v Speaker 3>It was how he was the exact age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>55 or whatever age he was.</v>

1384
01:06:14.831 --> 01:06:16.780
<v Speaker 3>Fifty four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in there.</v>

1385
01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:19.540
<v Speaker 3>That that's the average age for a male </v>
<v Speaker 3>pops are female.</v>

1386
01:06:19.541 --> 01:06:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't too different either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1387
01:06:20.801 --> 01:06:23.210
<v Speaker 3>his situation was he was addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>painkillers,</v>

1388
01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.880
<v Speaker 3>painkillers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pink pill pull out.</v>

1389
01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:29.400
<v Speaker 3>It just recently recently came out that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he had overdosed by.</v>

1390
01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:31.660
<v Speaker 3>He had been refusing treatment for aids </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>

1391
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:33.940
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true.</v>

1392
01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:34.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

1393
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:35.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>

1394
01:06:35.081 --> 01:06:38.320
<v Speaker 3>let's look that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I know for sure he had a hip issue,</v>

1395
01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:43.530
<v Speaker 3>like a severe hip problem that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably need hip surgery and he was </v>

1396
01:06:43.530 --> 01:06:45.130
<v Speaker 3>taking pain medication and he had had </v>
<v Speaker 3>overdosed on pain medication.</v>

1397
01:06:45.131 --> 01:06:45.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1398
01:06:45.341 --> 01:06:50.341
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was definitely addicted to pain </v>

1399
01:06:50.341 --> 01:06:51.871
<v Speaker 3>medications while I just realized I just</v>
<v Speaker 3>remembered a story coming out shortly </v>

1400
01:06:51.871 --> 01:06:52.740
<v Speaker 3>after about hiv that he had believed </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1401
01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:57.040
<v Speaker 3>that he wasn't going to take treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Print suffered from aids,</v>

1402
01:06:57.041 --> 01:06:59.560
<v Speaker 3>but refuse treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Believed god will cure him.</v>

1403
01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:01.180
<v Speaker 3>Us tabloid claims.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See?</v>

1404
01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:02.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1405
01:07:02.111 --> 01:07:06.190
<v Speaker 3>that's a us tablet clamps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was a christian scientist.</v>

1406
01:07:06.191 --> 01:07:11.191
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't near a jehovah's witness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jehovah's witness don't use the medicine</v>

1407
01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:12.490
<v Speaker 3>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1408
01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.110
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he.</v>

1409
01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:19.120
<v Speaker 3>Cause he got it back in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then how the fuck is he taking pain </v>

1410
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:19.120
<v Speaker 3>pills then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Supposedly he was on opiates too,</v>

1411
01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:19.150
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think.</v>

1412
01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:20.360
<v Speaker 3>Well that's pain pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1413
01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:23.020
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make that logic doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>make sense I suppose.</v>

1414
01:07:23.110 --> 01:07:28.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are just fucking convenient with </v>

1415
01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:28.110
<v Speaker 3>their logic on thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1416
01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:28.110
<v Speaker 3>The things that weird guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1417
01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:32.970
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prince was like androgynous and is all </v>

1418
01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:32.970
<v Speaker 3>about free love anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>High heels,</v>

1419
01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:34.150
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't like gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know,</v>

1420
01:07:34.151 --> 01:07:39.151
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that prince prince is </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a known homophobe and one of the </v>

1421
01:07:39.151 --> 01:07:39.151
<v Speaker 3>things that he said in a recent </v>
<v Speaker 3>interview,</v>

1422
01:07:39.151 --> 01:07:43.771
<v Speaker 3>and I hate to disparage him in his death</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was a brilliant artist and </v>

1423
01:07:43.771 --> 01:07:47.401
<v Speaker 3>all that good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was talking about how one of the </v>

1424
01:07:47.401 --> 01:07:50.380
<v Speaker 3>problems with the world today is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>god said all these rules and then people</v>

1425
01:07:50.381 --> 01:07:55.381
<v Speaker 3>just decide they want to stick their </v>
<v Speaker 3>dick and this whole with that hole and </v>

1426
01:07:55.381 --> 01:07:55.780
<v Speaker 3>just do anything they want to do and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't do that.</v>

1427
01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:58.280
<v Speaker 3>And they were asking them about gay </v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage and you know,</v>

1428
01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.310
<v Speaker 3>he was saying that this is not what god </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted.</v>

1429
01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:03.460
<v Speaker 3>This is not what god asked for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like see if you can find the exact quote</v>

1430
01:08:03.461 --> 01:08:08.461
<v Speaker 3>because it was pretty disturbing coming </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a guy that you expect because of </v>

1431
01:08:08.461 --> 01:08:12.391
<v Speaker 3>his sort of androgynous nature and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird you think he's like going further </v>

1432
01:08:12.391 --> 01:08:15.380
<v Speaker 3>in that direction because he's getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>older.</v>

1433
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.740
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1434
01:08:15.741 --> 01:08:15.920
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1435
01:08:15.921 --> 01:08:18.170
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I meant just maybe because of his actual</v>

1436
01:08:18.171 --> 01:08:19.910
<v Speaker 3>personal experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1437
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:21.070
<v Speaker 3>like in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1438
01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:24.290
<v Speaker 3>some people they overcompensate on one </v>
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

1439
01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:29.470
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think with prince was based on what </v>

1440
01:08:29.470 --> 01:08:33.371
<v Speaker 3>I've seen of his interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was insanely sheltered </v>

1441
01:08:33.371 --> 01:08:37.210
<v Speaker 3>because he was so famous in that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>could basically say anything and nobody </v>

1442
01:08:37.210 --> 01:08:41.951
<v Speaker 3>would disagree with him and he he </v>
<v Speaker 3>cultivated some really fucking wacky </v>

1443
01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:41.951
<v Speaker 3>opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1444
01:08:41.951 --> 01:08:46.661
<v Speaker 3>he believed that the government was </v>
<v Speaker 3>spraying things in the sky that made </v>

1445
01:08:46.661 --> 01:08:46.661
<v Speaker 3>people fight in the ghetto.</v>

1446
01:08:46.661 --> 01:08:46.970
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard that interview.</v>

1447
01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:48.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's insane.</v>

1448
01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:53.500
<v Speaker 3>It was like everybody would be fine and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then they would be spraying the sky and </v>

1449
01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.010
<v Speaker 3>then why is everybody fighting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are we all fighting?</v>

1450
01:08:55.011 --> 01:09:00.011
<v Speaker 3>Because you're poor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're living in the ghetto and there's </v>

1451
01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:01.340
<v Speaker 3>crime and that's just what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crime riddled areas.</v>

1452
01:09:01.341 --> 01:09:04.400
<v Speaker 3>There's violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the government spraying the sky</v>

1453
01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:08.240
<v Speaker 3>like what a random thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The government just decided to spray the</v>

1454
01:09:08.241 --> 01:09:11.060
<v Speaker 3>entire city and then hope that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>beats the shit out of each other.</v>

1455
01:09:11.061 --> 01:09:12.470
<v Speaker 3>For what purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very convenient.</v>

1456
01:09:12.471 --> 01:09:14.450
<v Speaker 3>They have money in ambulances,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what?</v>

1457
01:09:14.451 --> 01:09:16.580
<v Speaker 3>Where's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the profit margin in this?</v>

1458
01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.820
<v Speaker 3>Millions of dollars a spraying the sky </v>
<v Speaker 3>with anger,</v>

1459
01:09:19.821 --> 01:09:24.821
<v Speaker 3>chemicals and what fucking chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 3>have been proven to make people angry </v>

1460
01:09:24.821 --> 01:09:25.270
<v Speaker 3>when you sprayed from the sky?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1461
01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:30.700
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whiskey vapor probably be more fucking </v>

1462
01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:30.880
<v Speaker 3>and hugging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1463
01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.380
<v Speaker 3>what percentage of people actually get </v>
<v Speaker 3>angry when they get drunk?</v>

1464
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:35.600
<v Speaker 3>There's another one because think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the people that go to bars,</v>

1465
01:09:35.601 --> 01:09:36.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1466
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:38.750
<v Speaker 3>You get up fucking bar filled with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1467
01:09:38.751 --> 01:09:43.751
<v Speaker 3>You've got a thousand people in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many of them become angry when </v>

1468
01:09:43.751 --> 01:09:43.751
<v Speaker 3>they're drunk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even one.</v>

1469
01:09:43.751 --> 01:09:48.250
<v Speaker 3>It's a small percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very rare thing that people get </v>

1470
01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:48.250
<v Speaker 3>super angry and violent because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>drunk.</v>

1471
01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:50.090
<v Speaker 3>Most like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get happY.</v>

1472
01:09:50.091 --> 01:09:53.300
<v Speaker 3>Same when I'm drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hugging and laughing and I might get</v>

1473
01:09:53.301 --> 01:09:55.190
<v Speaker 3>a little obnoxious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not mean.</v>

1474
01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm definitely not looking to start </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights.</v>

1475
01:09:58.130 --> 01:09:59.540
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird one.</v>

1476
01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:00.680
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1477
01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.570
<v Speaker 3>some people will say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1478
01:10:02.571 --> 01:10:04.220
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy is an angry drunk.</v>

1479
01:10:04.221 --> 01:10:05.570
<v Speaker 3>Like you've heard that people are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1480
01:10:05.571 --> 01:10:10.571
<v Speaker 3>You've heard that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But is that just maybe who they are all </v>

1481
01:10:10.571 --> 01:10:12.350
<v Speaker 3>the time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a deep seated.</v>

1482
01:10:12.351 --> 01:10:17.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the alcohol sort of course is </v>

1483
01:10:17.351 --> 01:10:17.351
<v Speaker 3>it out of them?</v>

1484
01:10:17.351 --> 01:10:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the alcohol releases your </v>
<v Speaker 3>inhibitions and you're angry.</v>

1485
01:10:20.031 --> 01:10:23.330
<v Speaker 3>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prince denies anti gay rights remarks.</v>

1486
01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:26.180
<v Speaker 3>New yorker stands by story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is from 2008.</v>

1487
01:10:26.330 --> 01:10:26.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but see,</v>

1488
01:10:26.991 --> 01:10:30.410
<v Speaker 3>the problem is they quoted him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like there were direct quotes.</v>

1489
01:10:30.650 --> 01:10:31.440
<v Speaker 3>He.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1490
01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:34.190
<v Speaker 3>as far as this story came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm assuming when he died,</v>

1491
01:10:34.191 --> 01:10:36.010
<v Speaker 3>a lot of coats came out and stuff you </v>
<v Speaker 3>said in this,</v>

1492
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:38.240
<v Speaker 3>this story which I traced back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was when he was still alive,</v>

1493
01:10:38.241 --> 01:10:41.060
<v Speaker 3>obviously he came out after the story </v>
<v Speaker 3>came out,</v>

1494
01:10:41.061 --> 01:10:46.061
<v Speaker 3>the new yorker said he was grossly </v>
<v Speaker 3>misquoted and they took everything I </v>

1495
01:10:46.061 --> 01:10:46.061
<v Speaker 3>said out of context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1496
01:10:46.061 --> 01:10:47.180
<v Speaker 3>Stood by their story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However.</v>

1497
01:10:47.210 --> 01:10:49.160
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's read the context though.</v>

1498
01:10:49.161 --> 01:10:52.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean even when you read the actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>quote itself,</v>

1499
01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.990
<v Speaker 3>here's the quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a little bit higher.</v>

1500
01:10:53.991 --> 01:10:54.550
<v Speaker 3>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sponsor.</v>

1501
01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.630
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got the republicans.</v>

1502
01:10:56.631 --> 01:10:58.460
<v Speaker 3>Basically they want to live according to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bible,</v>

1503
01:10:58.461 --> 01:11:00.260
<v Speaker 3>but there's a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 3>interpretation.</v>

1504
01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.970
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've got some churches,</v>

1505
01:11:01.971 --> 01:11:04.850
<v Speaker 3>some people basically doing things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying comes from here,</v>

1506
01:11:04.851 --> 01:11:09.851
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you've got the opposite of the </v>

1507
01:11:09.851 --> 01:11:09.851
<v Speaker 3>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got blue,</v>

1508
01:11:09.851 --> 01:11:09.851
<v Speaker 3>you've got the democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>

1509
01:11:09.851 --> 01:11:10.430
<v Speaker 3>you could do whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gay marriage,</v>

1510
01:11:10.431 --> 01:11:12.050
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but neither of them is right.</v>

1511
01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm asked about his perspective</v>

1512
01:11:14.610 --> 01:11:16.020
<v Speaker 5>on social issues.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gay marriage,</v>

1513
01:11:16.021 --> 01:11:21.021
<v Speaker 5>abortion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Prince tapped his bible and said god </v>

1514
01:11:21.021 --> 01:11:23.790
<v Speaker 5>came to earth and saw people sticking it</v>
<v Speaker 5>wherever and doing it with whatever,</v>

1515
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.550
<v Speaker 5>and he just cleared it all out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

1516
01:11:26.551 --> 01:11:28.230
<v Speaker 5>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

1517
01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:33.740
<v Speaker 5>That's hilarious because a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucked each other in the ass listening </v>

1518
01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:37.041
<v Speaker 5>to let's go crazy how many people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how many people suck?</v>

1519
01:11:38.530 --> 01:11:39.720
<v Speaker 5>Cock,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it was like,</v>

1520
01:11:39.721 --> 01:11:42.300
<v Speaker 5>we're going to party like it's 1999.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they just said,</v>

1521
01:11:42.301 --> 01:11:44.970
<v Speaker 5>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll just do ecstasy in my asshole.</v>

1522
01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:47.000
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>

1523
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:51.660
<v Speaker 5>I think he's sheltered or was sheltered </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think he's a brilliant,</v>

1524
01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:57.170
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like the outlier of outliers when it </v>

1525
01:11:57.170 --> 01:11:59.070
<v Speaker 5>comes to brilliant artists and I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you just,</v>

1526
01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.740
<v Speaker 5>you by yourself to luck too much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't,</v>

1527
01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.630
<v Speaker 5>you don't get to mingle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't get to hang with.</v>

1528
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:05.400
<v Speaker 5>You don't have real conversations.</v>

1529
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:08.520
<v Speaker 5>But that's why I say like even in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>case of bill cosby,</v>

1530
01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:13.590
<v Speaker 5>are we looking at a condition of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>circumstance because if we have data </v>

1531
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:14.130
<v Speaker 5>that says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1532
01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:19.700
<v Speaker 5>pop stars are dying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm 30 years before any regular public </v>

1533
01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:24.860
<v Speaker 5>on average like these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these people obviously have an unusual </v>

1534
01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:26.400
<v Speaker 5>enough circumstance that it's affecting </v>
<v Speaker 5>all of them the same.</v>

1535
01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:31.460
<v Speaker 5>Unless the type of people drawn to that </v>
<v Speaker 5>career in the first place are already </v>

1536
01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:32.610
<v Speaker 5>substantially different than the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the public.</v>

1537
01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:37.850
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're definitely substantially </v>

1538
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:37.850
<v Speaker 5>different than the rest of the public in</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they've developed as an entertainer</v>

1539
01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:42.530
<v Speaker 5>from their formative years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean prince was an artist and a </v>

1540
01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:44.550
<v Speaker 5>musician when he was very young and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>when he came out with,</v>

1541
01:12:44.551 --> 01:12:47.490
<v Speaker 5>I want to be your lover.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he was only like 20 years old or</v>

1542
01:12:47.491 --> 01:12:52.491
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How old was he when I wanna be your </v>

1543
01:12:52.491 --> 01:12:52.491
<v Speaker 5>lover came out?</v>

1544
01:12:52.491 --> 01:12:52.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>definitely.</v>

1545
01:12:52.781 --> 01:12:55.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was a fucking jam too.</v>

1546
01:12:55.580 --> 01:13:00.580
<v Speaker 5>God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was a good song because I remember </v>

1547
01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:00.580
<v Speaker 5>I was living in boston.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm 48.</v>

1548
01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:02.610
<v Speaker 5>He was 55,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so he's not that much older than me.</v>

1549
01:13:02.611 --> 01:13:06.600
<v Speaker 5>When he died and I was living in boston </v>
<v Speaker 5>when that song came out and it was a jaw</v>

1550
01:13:06.601 --> 01:13:07.410
<v Speaker 5>dropper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1551
01:13:07.411 --> 01:13:11.330
<v Speaker 5>who is this guy with no shirt on and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>cover trying.</v>

1552
01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:12.870
<v Speaker 5>You're trying to figure out what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>hell it is,</v>

1553
01:13:12.871 --> 01:13:17.100
<v Speaker 5>20 or 21,</v>
<v Speaker 5>20 or 21 and that is a fucking beautiful</v>

1554
01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:22.101
<v Speaker 5>songs to this day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll play that song out of nowhere and </v>

1555
01:13:22.101 --> 01:13:22.860
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's who was an amazing artist.</v>

1556
01:13:23.070 --> 01:13:26.070
<v Speaker 5>So if he was that good at 20,</v>
<v Speaker 5>21,</v>

1557
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:30.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean he was involved in music from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>time he was a small boy.</v>

1558
01:13:30.121 --> 01:13:35.121
<v Speaker 5>So he developed in a very bizarre and </v>
<v Speaker 5>strange way and was under the microphone</v>

1559
01:13:35.521 --> 01:13:37.140
<v Speaker 5>at an incredibly young age.</v>

1560
01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:42.680
<v Speaker 5>Went to be that huge at 20 years old and</v>
<v Speaker 5>also to be such a revolutionary guy when</v>

1561
01:13:44.281 --> 01:13:48.060
<v Speaker 5>it came to style and fashion today I had</v>
<v Speaker 5>an overcoat when I was like 21,</v>

1562
01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:52.500
<v Speaker 5>a long overcoat because I saw principle </v>
<v Speaker 5>just to listen to prince music.</v>

1563
01:13:52.501 --> 01:13:54.990
<v Speaker 5>I loved prince when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was so good.</v>

1564
01:13:54.991 --> 01:13:57.150
<v Speaker 5>It was so different and interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1565
01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:59.670
<v Speaker 5>with so many good songs like </v>
<v Speaker 5>controversy,</v>

1566
01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had some and then also like some guys</v>

1567
01:14:02.911 --> 01:14:07.911
<v Speaker 5>sort of like came along with him like </v>
<v Speaker 5>morris day and the time because they </v>

1568
01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:11.511
<v Speaker 5>were in purple rain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>TheY sort of came along with him and </v>

1569
01:14:11.511 --> 01:14:11.511
<v Speaker 5>they got famous for a brief period of </v>
<v Speaker 5>time too.</v>

1570
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:12.970
<v Speaker 5>He was amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1571
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.250
<v Speaker 5>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I thinK I've always said this,</v>

1572
01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:17.020
<v Speaker 5>that I think you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

1573
01:14:17.150 --> 01:14:21.880
<v Speaker 5>there's a balance in this World that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>can achieve when you achieve greatness,</v>

1574
01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:23.650
<v Speaker 5>when you achieve that kind of greatness.</v>

1575
01:14:23.650 --> 01:14:28.650
<v Speaker 5>I think it's at this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at that is that the sacrifice of </v>

1576
01:14:28.650 --> 01:14:31.411
<v Speaker 5>balance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's balancing your social life </v>

1577
01:14:31.411 --> 01:14:32.570
<v Speaker 5>or balance in your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your ability to have a,</v>

1578
01:14:32.830 --> 01:14:37.160
<v Speaker 5>a healthy and a objective perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think in order like,</v>

1579
01:14:37.170 --> 01:14:42.170
<v Speaker 5>and I think that's what we're seeing </v>
<v Speaker 5>with kanye west to in order to like </v>

1580
01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:45.301
<v Speaker 5>really go after something and just be </v>
<v Speaker 5>obsessed with it to the point of just </v>

1581
01:14:45.301 --> 01:14:47.380
<v Speaker 5>carving out this magnificent diamond of </v>
<v Speaker 5>art.</v>

1582
01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:50.950
<v Speaker 5>You got to be a fucking nuts man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to be richard pryor.</v>

1583
01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.600
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you gotta be nuts.</v>

1584
01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:55.840
<v Speaker 5>You gotta be out of your fucking mind to</v>
<v Speaker 5>make something perfect,</v>

1585
01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:58.750
<v Speaker 5>and what he made was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1586
01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:02.530
<v Speaker 5>purple rain is god damn perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was perfect.</v>

1587
01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:05.770
<v Speaker 5>This is shit that he did that you just </v>
<v Speaker 5>to this day,</v>

1588
01:15:05.771 --> 01:15:07.660
<v Speaker 5>you just go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>god damn.</v>

1589
01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:12.720
<v Speaker 5>He was so good that all the other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 5>is probably a symptom of a lack of </v>

1590
01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:19.920
<v Speaker 5>balance and development and his overall </v>
<v Speaker 5>life that led to this incredible </v>

1591
01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:20.560
<v Speaker 5>brilliance and his art form.</v>

1592
01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:22.510
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there has to be.</v>

1593
01:15:22.570 --> 01:15:23.890
<v Speaker 5>It has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to sacrifice,</v>

1594
01:15:23.891 --> 01:15:28.891
<v Speaker 5>you have to take from somewhere where </v>
<v Speaker 5>they say james cameron's out of his </v>

1595
01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:28.891
<v Speaker 5>fucking mind frame.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They say,</v>

1596
01:15:28.891 --> 01:15:29.680
<v Speaker 5>James Cameron is out of his fucking </v>

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:29.090
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean in tHat way,</v>

1711
01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:29.090
<v Speaker 2>joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1712
01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:29.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say anything,</v>

1713
01:20:29.131 --> 01:20:29.830
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>

1714
01:20:30.510 --> 01:20:33.180
<v Speaker 2>just the way you're looking at me </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at you that way all the time,</v>

1715
01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:40.220
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this process of like getting </v>

1716
01:20:40.220 --> 01:20:40.620
<v Speaker 2>to know the thing and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a person who watches you,</v>

1717
01:20:40.621 --> 01:20:41.480
<v Speaker 2>sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1718
01:20:41.590 --> 01:20:46.590
<v Speaker 5>that authenticity comes through and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the reasons why your videos are </v>

1719
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:47.560
<v Speaker 5>so compelling because like when you open</v>
<v Speaker 5>up a video and you're checking out a new</v>

1720
01:20:47.561 --> 01:20:51.520
<v Speaker 5>phone and you're going over the edges </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're experiencing it for the first</v>

1721
01:20:51.521 --> 01:20:53.460
<v Speaker 5>time with the person that's watching the</v>
<v Speaker 5>video.</v>

1722
01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:58.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be you the proxy version of </v>

1723
01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:02.121
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how would you engage with this </v>

1724
01:21:02.121 --> 01:21:04.491
<v Speaker 2>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in many cases the defacto standard </v>

1725
01:21:04.491 --> 01:21:05.400
<v Speaker 2>for these types of videos was like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who had,</v>

1726
01:21:06.130 --> 01:21:07.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1727
01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:08.820
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was more sort of journalistic.</v>

1728
01:21:08.821 --> 01:21:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Like they had it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

1729
01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:12.360
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're expected to make a report on the</v>

1730
01:21:12.361 --> 01:21:12.840
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1731
01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:14.130
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I respect that.</v>

1732
01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:19.160
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time it's like it </v>

1733
01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:22.431
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that part of it doesn't necessarily </v>

1734
01:21:22.431 --> 01:21:22.431
<v Speaker 2>capture the excitement associated with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing,</v>

1735
01:21:22.431 --> 01:21:26.391
<v Speaker 2>the oohs and aahs and and all that kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of natural reaction,</v>

1736
01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:29.400
<v Speaker 2>which is impossible to fake all the rest</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

1737
01:21:29.401 --> 01:21:31.620
<v Speaker 2>You can all the rest of it when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to like,</v>

1738
01:21:31.621 --> 01:21:33.780
<v Speaker 2>let's do that line again because I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1739
01:21:33.781 --> 01:21:35.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say you didn't say the spec,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1740
01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.770
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that would be the equivalent of the</v>

1741
01:21:37.771 --> 01:21:42.771
<v Speaker 2>situation I was in yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like I'm willing to sacrifice </v>

1742
01:21:42.771 --> 01:21:44.070
<v Speaker 2>some of that to get the intangible </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

1743
01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.280
<v Speaker 2>which is the oohs and ahs that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>never happen again.</v>

1744
01:21:47.281 --> 01:21:49.460
<v Speaker 2>Not in the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1745
01:21:49.930 --> 01:21:50.230
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1746
01:21:50.231 --> 01:21:55.231
<v Speaker 5>I agree with you and I think that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>understand what you're doing and you </v>

1747
01:21:55.231 --> 01:21:58.861
<v Speaker 5>understand the appeal of what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing and to sacrifice that,</v>

1748
01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:04.440
<v Speaker 5>to polish it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to make it more professional or to make </v>

1749
01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:08.240
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's actually going to lessen the </v>

1750
01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:08.240
<v Speaker 5>appeal of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what they don't understand.</v>

1751
01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:11.581
<v Speaker 5>It's a fine line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like those fucking videos where </v>

1752
01:22:11.581 --> 01:22:14.161
<v Speaker 5>people have these edits every five </v>
<v Speaker 5>seconds they say something is a cut and </v>

1753
01:22:14.161 --> 01:22:17.761
<v Speaker 5>they say something as a cut,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that style of youtube video </v>

1754
01:22:17.761 --> 01:22:18.190
<v Speaker 5>cut,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that shit is gross man and there's a guy</v>

1755
01:22:18.191 --> 01:22:23.191
<v Speaker 5>who did that recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a video about bow hunting and </v>

1756
01:22:23.191 --> 01:22:25.270
<v Speaker 5>he's trying to do that style and bow </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunting,</v>

1757
01:22:25.271 --> 01:22:27.790
<v Speaker 5>which is one of the most organic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>visceral,</v>

1758
01:22:27.791 --> 01:22:30.910
<v Speaker 5>primal things you could ever engage in </v>
<v Speaker 5>as a human being.</v>

1759
01:22:31.090 --> 01:22:35.020
<v Speaker 5>You're going to go out and collect your </v>
<v Speaker 5>food with a sharp stick,</v>

1760
01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:41.340
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so this guy is using this like this </v>

1761
01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:41.920
<v Speaker 5>common thing that you see like these </v>
<v Speaker 5>girls do,</v>

1762
01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.780
<v Speaker 5>and then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's got to be a better way.</v>

1763
01:22:43.930 --> 01:22:48.930
<v Speaker 5>A little app,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not bouncing around the screen </v>

1764
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:48.930
<v Speaker 5>that was in this corner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then I wasn't doing that.</v>

1765
01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:50.890
<v Speaker 5>He was standing right in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fast cuts.</v>

1766
01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:54.700
<v Speaker 5>Like there was no pauses and it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>disconcerting.</v>

1767
01:22:54.701 --> 01:22:59.701
<v Speaker 5>It's like throws you off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is the opposite of authentic </v>

1768
01:22:59.701 --> 01:23:02.110
<v Speaker 5>because you know that there's all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>edits and those edits take you out.</v>

1769
01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:07.320
<v Speaker 5>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those edits treat you like you're a </v>

1770
01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:07.390
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're so fucking stupid.</v>

1771
01:23:07.391 --> 01:23:12.010
<v Speaker 5>You can't even listen to a guy talk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Here's your attention span is so short.</v>

1772
01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:17.250
<v Speaker 5>I can't listen to louis open this vr box</v>
<v Speaker 5>and go to this thing in real time and </v>

1773
01:23:18.491 --> 01:23:20.170
<v Speaker 5>inspect the overall.</v>

1774
01:23:21.410 --> 01:23:23.000
<v Speaker 2>To be quite honest with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of,</v>

1775
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:28.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean you have this platform here </v>

1776
01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:28.820
<v Speaker 2>where people sit down for hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1777
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:31.010
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's becoming not,</v>

1778
01:23:31.050 --> 01:23:36.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the status quo on the </v>

1779
01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:37.841
<v Speaker 2>internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The internet keeps chopping it in the </v>

1780
01:23:37.841 --> 01:23:38.150
<v Speaker 2>other direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting shorter and shorter conversation</v>

1781
01:23:38.151 --> 01:23:40.970
<v Speaker 2>has to move faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to jump to the bowhunting guys.</v>

1782
01:23:40.971 --> 01:23:45.971
<v Speaker 2>Got to jump around the screen and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean if you get obsessed with the </v>

1783
01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:47.990
<v Speaker 2>analytics and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see like how,</v>

1784
01:23:48.010 --> 01:23:51.230
<v Speaker 2>how often an average person watches for </v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

1785
01:23:51.231 --> 01:23:56.231
<v Speaker 2>And there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no denying the fact that </v>

1786
01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:56.960
<v Speaker 2>people's attention spans are shrinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>

1787
01:23:56.961 --> 01:24:01.961
<v Speaker 2>do you want to contribute to that or do </v>
<v Speaker 2>you think that there's enough people </v>

1788
01:24:01.961 --> 01:24:05.150
<v Speaker 2>that are willing to accept the </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative because you know,</v>

1789
01:24:05.151 --> 01:24:06.800
<v Speaker 2>you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got an example here,</v>

1790
01:24:06.801 --> 01:24:08.870
<v Speaker 2>which is unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think,</v>

1791
01:24:08.871 --> 01:24:13.871
<v Speaker 2>what do you think happens here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That people stick around for three </v>

1792
01:24:13.871 --> 01:24:13.871
<v Speaker 2>hours?</v>

1793
01:24:13.871 --> 01:24:15.240
<v Speaker 5>I never thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what happeNs.</v>

1794
01:24:15.300 --> 01:24:17.550
<v Speaker 5>I never thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just said I like talking to people,</v>

1795
01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:19.590
<v Speaker 5>so let's record it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1796
01:24:19.591 --> 01:24:20.730
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But man,</v>

1797
01:24:20.731 --> 01:24:23.880
<v Speaker 5>I took a lot of heat in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You were telling me I had to edit it.</v>

1798
01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:25.110
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>People.</v>

1799
01:24:25.230 --> 01:24:30.230
<v Speaker 5>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like some of the earliest </v>

1800
01:24:30.230 --> 01:24:30.230
<v Speaker 5>comments were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why is it showed three hours long?</v>

1801
01:24:30.230 --> 01:24:31.140
<v Speaker 5>This is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No one's going to listen to three hours.</v>

1802
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:32.660
<v Speaker 5>Like even my friends were telling me </v>
<v Speaker 5>this like,</v>

1803
01:24:32.670 --> 01:24:33.390
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you to edit it,</v>

1804
01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:34.320
<v Speaker 5>make it an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

1805
01:24:34.321 --> 01:24:37.350
<v Speaker 5>why go after an hour?</v>
<v Speaker 5>People just shut it off.</v>

1806
01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:40.260
<v Speaker 5>If they don't want to watch more than an</v>
<v Speaker 5>hour or listen to it was listened back.</v>

1807
01:24:40.261 --> 01:24:41.870
<v Speaker 5>Then you don't want to listen to more </v>
<v Speaker 5>than an hour.</v>

1808
01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:43.890
<v Speaker 5>Just shut it off at an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who gets interesting?</v>

1809
01:24:43.891 --> 01:24:45.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was a who gives a fuck thing?</v>

1810
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:47.160
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to do what I want to do.</v>

1811
01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.640
<v Speaker 5>I'm not trying to make money off this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not trying to do anything unusual.</v>

1812
01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:52.890
<v Speaker 5>I just like having conversations with </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1813
01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:57.980
<v Speaker 5>so let's bring in someone interesting </v>
<v Speaker 5>and let's talk because the art of </v>

1814
01:24:57.980 --> 01:25:02.481
<v Speaker 5>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like just having a conversation for the </v>

1815
01:25:02.481 --> 01:25:05.241
<v Speaker 5>purpose of having a conversation is lost</v>
<v Speaker 5>in a lot of venues because what you're </v>

1816
01:25:05.241 --> 01:25:06.450
<v Speaker 5>gettIng instead is interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1817
01:25:06.451 --> 01:25:08.670
<v Speaker 5>like you and I are friends.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've been friends for a couple of years</v>

1818
01:25:08.671 --> 01:25:09.900
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When we sit down,</v>

1819
01:25:09.901 --> 01:25:14.901
<v Speaker 5>I'm super confident that we're just </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to have fun and we're going to </v>

1820
01:25:14.901 --> 01:25:14.901
<v Speaker 5>talk and we're going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation.</v>

1821
01:25:14.901 --> 01:25:17.040
<v Speaker 5>That's why this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I left my hoUse today and I was like,</v>

1822
01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go have fun with lewis.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to have a good conversation.</v>

1823
01:25:19.921 --> 01:25:22.230
<v Speaker 5>It's going to be cool because that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>what I want to hear.</v>

1824
01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:26.220
<v Speaker 5>I want to hear people having a </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation and so for me it was just a</v>

1825
01:25:26.221 --> 01:25:27.030
<v Speaker 5>matter of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1826
01:25:27.031 --> 01:25:32.031
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to have this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It gives me an opportunity to sit down </v>

1827
01:25:32.031 --> 01:25:32.330
<v Speaker 5>with someone for three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is super rare in this world when.</v>

1828
01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:37.380
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When do you ever get a chance to put </v>

1829
01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:39.351
<v Speaker 5>your phone aside and just sit down?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll just look at a friend in the eyes </v>

1830
01:25:39.351 --> 01:25:39.351
<v Speaker 5>and just talk about it.</v>

1831
01:25:39.351 --> 01:25:41.320
<v Speaker 2>I've before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when I was,</v>

1832
01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:46.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been here for a couple of days and </v>

1833
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.550
<v Speaker 2>know I'm telling people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1834
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1835
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.550
<v Speaker 2>saturday I can't hang out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

1836
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:47.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna be on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1837
01:25:48.430 --> 01:25:51.520
<v Speaker 2>what do you guys do to prepare for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and on your podcast?</v>

1838
01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:52.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1839
01:25:52.031 --> 01:25:57.031
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you actually just sit down and you </v>

1840
01:25:57.031 --> 01:25:58.330
<v Speaker 2>just start talking and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long for three hours.</v>

1841
01:25:58.780 --> 01:25:59.590
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

1842
01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:04.650
<v Speaker 2>How do you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't like this some kind of magic </v>

1843
01:26:04.650 --> 01:26:06.931
<v Speaker 2>to it when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when as you said it is the simplest </v>

1844
01:26:06.931 --> 01:26:06.931
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's like,</v>

1845
01:26:06.931 --> 01:26:08.400
<v Speaker 2>or it's maybe it's a forgotten thing of </v>
<v Speaker 2>just being able to</v>

1846
01:26:08.530 --> 01:26:13.530
<v Speaker 5>do this well if you actually are </v>
<v Speaker 5>interested in life and you find another </v>

1847
01:26:13.530 --> 01:26:13.900
<v Speaker 5>person who is actually interested in </v>
<v Speaker 5>libraries,</v>

1848
01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:16.450
<v Speaker 5>I think the hard part is ending it three</v>
<v Speaker 5>hours,</v>

1849
01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.410
<v Speaker 5>three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're talking.</v>

1850
01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:20.980
<v Speaker 5>We haven't even talked about a million </v>
<v Speaker 5>different things.</v>

1851
01:26:21.330 --> 01:26:23.770
<v Speaker 5>I've been watching your videos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a lot of fucking questions.</v>

1852
01:26:23.771 --> 01:26:25.600
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot going on in the world.</v>

1853
01:26:25.690 --> 01:26:27.330
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's so much to talk about.</v>

1854
01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:29.410
<v Speaker 5>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand people who don't have</v>

1855
01:26:29.411 --> 01:26:31.990
<v Speaker 5>anything to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That to me is perplexing.</v>

1856
01:26:32.410 --> 01:26:37.410
<v Speaker 5>When someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how can you find things to talk about </v>

1857
01:26:37.410 --> 01:26:37.410
<v Speaker 5>for three hours?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like how do you not talk?</v>

1858
01:26:37.570 --> 01:26:37.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1859
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:41.140
<v Speaker 2>Well in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that this kind of like a,</v>

1860
01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:44.930
<v Speaker 2>a service being like it's surprising to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me how many.</v>

1861
01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Like when I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1862
01:26:46.251 --> 01:26:48.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be on here and I put it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>my twitter or whatever,</v>

1863
01:26:48.191 --> 01:26:49.850
<v Speaker 2>like how many people are pumped about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1864
01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:50.960
<v Speaker 2>pumped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1865
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:53.630
<v Speaker 2>oh thank god we're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1866
01:26:53.690 --> 01:26:56.630
<v Speaker 2>Like they love the idea of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

1867
01:26:57.290 --> 01:26:59.660
<v Speaker 2>it's a departure from the way I normally</v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate with them.</v>

1868
01:26:59.950 --> 01:27:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For you it's the standard,</v>

1869
01:27:02.151 --> 01:27:04.310
<v Speaker 2>so I think you're really aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets,</v>

1870
01:27:04.340 --> 01:27:09.340
<v Speaker 2>it gets personal in a different way when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using this medium where there </v>

1871
01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:11.580
<v Speaker 2>aren't these definitive parameters that </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist in your,</v>

1872
01:27:11.610 --> 01:27:16.610
<v Speaker 2>your typical youtube video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your typical sweet or vine or whatever </v>

1873
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:17.330
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like those ones are all,</v>

1874
01:27:17.331 --> 01:27:19.720
<v Speaker 2>so it's almost like every social media </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1875
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:23.720
<v Speaker 2>it has it's kind of structure that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>landed on for the standard,</v>

1876
01:27:23.740 --> 01:27:25.160
<v Speaker 2>the status quo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

1877
01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:30.370
<v Speaker 2>you've been doing this for a while now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you've been on many different </v>

1878
01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:33.581
<v Speaker 2>platforms and you just kept in here the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same essentially like as far as the </v>

1879
01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:34.460
<v Speaker 2>format is concerned.</v>

1880
01:27:34.730 --> 01:27:37.340
<v Speaker 2>But I think there is something to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>said for.</v>

1881
01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:41.810
<v Speaker 2>I think what ends up happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we end giving people that access is that</v>

1882
01:27:41.811 --> 01:27:43.520
<v Speaker 2>it means more to them like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1883
01:27:43.650 --> 01:27:48.650
<v Speaker 2>that you simply can't get to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody in a three minute segment that </v>

1884
01:27:48.650 --> 01:27:49.220
<v Speaker 2>you can in three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'S impossible.</v>

1885
01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:52.100
<v Speaker 2>So what would they actually end up </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting here is,</v>

1886
01:27:52.101 --> 01:27:57.101
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is something that matters substantially </v>

1887
01:27:57.101 --> 01:27:59.891
<v Speaker 2>more to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will they kind of get like digital </v>

1888
01:27:59.891 --> 01:27:59.891
<v Speaker 2>friendships?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>

1889
01:27:59.891 --> 01:28:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's exactly.</v>

1890
01:28:00.591 --> 01:28:02.340
<v Speaker 2>I think how it's looked at and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1891
01:28:03.150 --> 01:28:08.150
<v Speaker 2>in a world where we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we realized that there is an </v>

1892
01:28:08.150 --> 01:28:11.050
<v Speaker 2>increasingly short attention span.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wonder how much of this kind of </v>

1893
01:28:12.081 --> 01:28:15.620
<v Speaker 2>stuff here actually replaces the real </v>
<v Speaker 2>world version of it.</v>

1894
01:28:15.650 --> 01:28:20.650
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people can't be in a movie theater </v>

1895
01:28:20.650 --> 01:28:22.601
<v Speaker 2>without being on their phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they can't drive without being on </v>

1896
01:28:22.601 --> 01:28:22.601
<v Speaker 2>their phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this thing,</v>

1897
01:28:22.601 --> 01:28:25.730
<v Speaker 2>if we are literally building new </v>
<v Speaker 2>pathways in our heads for how we,</v>

1898
01:28:25.940 --> 01:28:30.940
<v Speaker 2>how we look at spare time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then is this thing in alternative to </v>

1899
01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:31.540
<v Speaker 2>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this,</v>

1900
01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:32.540
<v Speaker 2>is this where people get it?</v>

1901
01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:34.970
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I think a lot of people do</v>

1902
01:28:34.971 --> 01:28:37.310
<v Speaker 5>with podcasts is one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>I do with podcasts,</v>

1903
01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:39.730
<v Speaker 5>it replaced radio in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1904
01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.270
<v Speaker 5>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>200 percent.</v>

1905
01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:43.580
<v Speaker 5>When I drive around,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't listen to the radio anymore.</v>

1906
01:28:43.581 --> 01:28:47.280
<v Speaker 5>I listen to different podcasts and media</v>
<v Speaker 5>or radio lab,</v>

1907
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:50.780
<v Speaker 5>ted radio hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All my friends like joey diaz,</v>

1908
01:28:50.781 --> 01:28:55.781
<v Speaker 5>his podcasts and ras and dunkin's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I listened to all my friends podcasts </v>

1909
01:28:55.781 --> 01:28:57.710
<v Speaker 5>and different people's podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just think it's an amazing thing.</v>

1910
01:28:57.950 --> 01:29:01.710
<v Speaker 5>I love the fact that at a red light you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could just go to your thing,</v>

1911
01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 5>press</v>

1912
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.450
<v Speaker 3>play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>find it.</v>

1913
01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.190
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a new episode of this out.</v>

1914
01:29:05.191 --> 01:29:06.330
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>press play,</v>

1915
01:29:06.331 --> 01:29:08.970
<v Speaker 3>and it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it stimulates you.</v>

1916
01:29:08.971 --> 01:29:13.971
<v Speaker 3>When you're in your car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gives you interesting conversations </v>

1917
01:29:13.971 --> 01:29:16.851
<v Speaker 3>when you're on a plane or when you're at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gym and it replaces a lot of </v>

1918
01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:20.670
<v Speaker 3>traditional standard media in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also because there's no ads,</v>

1919
01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:25.760
<v Speaker 3>there's ads in the beginning and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want you fast forward through those </v>

1920
01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:28.281
<v Speaker 3>fuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the three hours of the podcast is </v>

1921
01:29:28.281 --> 01:29:28.740
<v Speaker 3>totally uninterrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's unusual though.</v>

1922
01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.180
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's my choice.</v>

1923
01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:35.420
<v Speaker 3>I was unwilling to do it any other way </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't want it to be </v>

1924
01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:35.420
<v Speaker 3>interrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They try to get you to change.</v>

1925
01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they still do.</v>

1926
01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Really fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not available.</v>

1927
01:29:39.971 --> 01:29:41.100
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just not doing it.</v>

1928
01:29:41.101 --> 01:29:43.140
<v Speaker 3>They want me to interrupt the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the conversation and go,</v>

1929
01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:48.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know about </v>

1930
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:50.001
<v Speaker 3>squarespace lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but squarespace is a platform against </v>

1931
01:29:50.001 --> 01:29:50.001
<v Speaker 3>squarespace.</v>

1932
01:29:50.001 --> 01:29:51.080
<v Speaker 3>Squarespace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're awesome,</v>

1933
01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:53.250
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't squarespace that was asking me</v>

1934
01:29:53.251 --> 01:29:56.250
<v Speaker 3>instead that the agents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right sell these course,</v>

1935
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:59.190
<v Speaker 3>they zero fucks about the content </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself,</v>

1936
01:29:59.191 --> 01:30:01.520
<v Speaker 3>about the actual important part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this.</v>

1937
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:03.090
<v Speaker 3>There was another thing that I had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight with.</v>

1938
01:30:03.091 --> 01:30:08.091
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way you're going to get ads </v>

1939
01:30:08.091 --> 01:30:08.091
<v Speaker 3>unless they do it in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

1940
01:30:08.091 --> 01:30:08.091
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well then I'm not going to have.</v>

1941
01:30:08.091 --> 01:30:12.451
<v Speaker 3>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not like my primary source of </v>

1942
01:30:12.451 --> 01:30:13.830
<v Speaker 3>income.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for me thIs is a labor of love,</v>

1943
01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:14.930
<v Speaker 3>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1944
01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:17.890
<v Speaker 3>I want to do it correctly and making me </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel special here,</v>

1945
01:30:17.950 --> 01:30:19.800
<v Speaker 3>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't have anybody on that.</v>

1946
01:30:19.801 --> 01:30:22.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to have on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no one that tells me what to do</v>

1947
01:30:22.351 --> 01:30:27.351
<v Speaker 3>is know producer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I have someone like you or </v>

1948
01:30:27.351 --> 01:30:29.961
<v Speaker 3>anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because I think it is going to be </v>

1949
01:30:29.961 --> 01:30:29.961
<v Speaker 3>an interesting conversation.</v>

1950
01:30:29.961 --> 01:30:29.961
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking forward to having it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1951
01:30:29.961 --> 01:30:31.350
<v Speaker 3>That's the agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the whole thing.</v>

1952
01:30:31.351 --> 01:30:32.660
<v Speaker 3>So I'm not interrupting that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1953
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:33.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have any.</v>

1954
01:30:34.050 --> 01:30:36.120
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a great message.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gotta be honest with you.</v>

1955
01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:41.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there pushing that particular </v>

1956
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.880
<v Speaker 3>message in the space I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1957
01:30:41.881 --> 01:30:42.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1958
01:30:43.020 --> 01:30:45.390
<v Speaker 3>especially since he's a particularly on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the video side,</v>

1959
01:30:45.391 --> 01:30:48.780
<v Speaker 3>on the youtube site,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's emerging as a real business,</v>

1960
01:30:48.781 --> 01:30:49.870
<v Speaker 3>real enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What'S.</v>

1961
01:30:49.890 --> 01:30:52.740
<v Speaker 3>Because there's so much money in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much money in it.</v>

1962
01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:53.930
<v Speaker 3>It's craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1963
01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:56.790
<v Speaker 3>it's bonkers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>

1964
01:30:56.791 --> 01:30:58.200
<v Speaker 3>there's no rule book on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1965
01:30:58.260 --> 01:31:00.510
<v Speaker 3>there's no parameters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nobody out there saying,</v>

1966
01:31:00.511 --> 01:31:02.610
<v Speaker 3>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're taking a risk on that one.</v>

1967
01:31:03.090 --> 01:31:04.130
<v Speaker 3>Here's what's going to happen in </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

1968
01:31:04.131 --> 01:31:05.690
<v Speaker 3>I seen it because I've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

1969
01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:10.700
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think to hear somebody like you who's </v>

1970
01:31:10.700 --> 01:31:10.920
<v Speaker 3>had success in this space to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1971
01:31:11.190 --> 01:31:12.310
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't compromise.</v>

1972
01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:17.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even when a million people are telling </v>

1973
01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:17.540
<v Speaker 3>me to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise,</v>

1974
01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:19.930
<v Speaker 3>I think for a lot of people starting out</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might have a youtube channel,</v>

1975
01:31:19.931 --> 01:31:21.580
<v Speaker 3>they might whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1976
01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:22.300
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1977
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:25.230
<v Speaker 3>to be empowered by knowing that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do it.</v>

1978
01:31:25.670 --> 01:31:28.890
<v Speaker 3>I got steve rinella to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mediator podcasts,</v>

1979
01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:30.550
<v Speaker 3>I don't interrupt the podcast anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1980
01:31:30.570 --> 01:31:32.010
<v Speaker 3>he used to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to interrupt it.</v>

1981
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:34.170
<v Speaker 3>Like if you listen to the dan flores </v>
<v Speaker 3>episode,</v>

1982
01:31:34.171 --> 01:31:36.450
<v Speaker 3>there's no interruptions and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes it good.</v>

1983
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:39.120
<v Speaker 3>Here's my ethic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Number one,</v>

1984
01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.310
<v Speaker 3>don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or do you do your best?</v>

1985
01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:43.140
<v Speaker 3>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do your best to make it entertaining.</v>

1986
01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:48.380
<v Speaker 3>Don't do anything that would compromise </v>
<v Speaker 3>the quality of it just for profit and as</v>

1987
01:31:48.690 --> 01:31:50.370
<v Speaker 3>long as you just do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do your best.</v>

1988
01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:55.580
<v Speaker 3>Don't completely honest here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I fucked up on number of occasions </v>

1989
01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:56.350
<v Speaker 3>like in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1990
01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:58.710
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in completing what you just said.</v>

1991
01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:00.010
<v Speaker 3>There are times</v>

1992
01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:05.010
<v Speaker 2>where I get too deep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too deep and then I'm in it and I'm </v>

1993
01:32:05.010 --> 01:32:05.010
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck,</v>

1994
01:32:05.010 --> 01:32:05.770
<v Speaker 2>this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a nightmare.</v>

1995
01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Like how so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1996
01:32:06.761 --> 01:32:11.761
<v Speaker 2>I mean with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a brand or a sponsorship or </v>

1997
01:32:11.761 --> 01:32:11.761
<v Speaker 2>something like that where where it'll be</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1998
01:32:12.430 --> 01:32:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I'll know it's a nightmare once I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1999
01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:17.380
<v Speaker 2>but even though I've been sold a bill of</v>
<v Speaker 2>goods,</v>

2000
01:32:17.381 --> 01:32:19.240
<v Speaker 2>that isn't the thing that I actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>signed up for.</v>

2001
01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:24.960
<v Speaker 2>It happens frequently with mean I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing with the biggest brands on the </v>

2002
01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:25.810
<v Speaker 2>planet and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2003
01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:27.970
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversational.</v>

2004
01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.490
<v Speaker 2>You're jusT going to discover the god </v>
<v Speaker 2>damn thing or whatever.</v>

2005
01:32:30.491 --> 01:32:32.690
<v Speaker 2>And then you get there and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's your script.</v>

2006
01:32:32.691 --> 01:32:33.910
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

2007
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you like for a certain product they </v>

2008
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.870
<v Speaker 2>actually do if you're there for a launch</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something to give you scripts.</v>

2009
01:32:41.050 --> 01:32:42.760
<v Speaker 2>No big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't read a script.</v>

2010
01:32:42.761 --> 01:32:44.860
<v Speaker 2>I never read a goddamn split.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried to.</v>

2011
01:32:44.890 --> 01:32:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2012
01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:47.680
<v Speaker 2>And what does that conversation like </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you tell them?</v>

2013
01:32:47.681 --> 01:32:52.681
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a bunch of producers </v>

2014
01:32:52.681 --> 01:32:53.860
<v Speaker 2>pretending that it's impossible for me </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that.</v>

2015
01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about this?</v>

2016
01:32:54.821 --> 01:32:58.340
<v Speaker 2>How about them trying to change your </v>
<v Speaker 2>wardrobe to try to change your wardrobe?</v>

2017
01:32:58.370 --> 01:32:58.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2018
01:32:58.901 --> 01:33:01.660
<v Speaker 2>I've been in his hoodie forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the hat on,</v>

2019
01:33:01.690 --> 01:33:03.390
<v Speaker 2>like people know how I look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2020
01:33:03.670 --> 01:33:08.020
<v Speaker 2>It's this weird situation of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>advertisers and the business side of the</v>

2021
01:33:08.021 --> 01:33:13.021
<v Speaker 2>thing not being used to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of people have of basically </v>

2022
01:33:14.471 --> 01:33:16.720
<v Speaker 2>disrespecting the audience is what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

2023
01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Because you're going to come at it from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a respect point of view.</v>

2024
01:33:20.201 --> 01:33:22.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to come at it from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>respectful point of view,</v>

2025
01:33:22.061 --> 01:33:25.060
<v Speaker 2>but they're used to like inserting </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that nobody wants.</v>

2026
01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:28.940
<v Speaker 2>So they automatically assume if they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>working with you that they got to that,</v>

2027
01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:34.140
<v Speaker 2>that nobody wants what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about in reference to that project or </v>

2028
01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:35.140
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they come at it from a negative,</v>

2029
01:33:35.141 --> 01:33:37.540
<v Speaker 2>from a guilty point of view as opposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to like,</v>

2030
01:33:37.541 --> 01:33:39.100
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like this guy,</v>

2031
01:33:39.101 --> 01:33:41.320
<v Speaker 2>the way he is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave him alone,</v>

2032
01:33:41.730 --> 01:33:43.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they signed up for.</v>

2033
01:33:43.301 --> 01:33:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Why are we trying to rewrite it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they want to in the soup.</v>

2034
01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:50.640
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is like if you're going to have that </v>

2035
01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:52.890
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to have this situation </v>

2036
01:33:52.890 --> 01:33:53.650
<v Speaker 2>where there's like 50 or 100 people to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get this piece of content,</v>

2037
01:33:53.651 --> 01:33:57.270
<v Speaker 2>everybody in there needs to carve out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2038
01:33:57.490 --> 01:34:00.970
<v Speaker 2>That grew for themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place to fit well and they look,</v>

2039
01:34:00.971 --> 01:34:04.960
<v Speaker 2>they look for some way that they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell everybody.</v>

2040
01:34:04.961 --> 01:34:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Like lewis was going to wear that hat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2041
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:08.320
<v Speaker 2>And I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2042
01:34:08.321 --> 01:34:09.820
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see this,</v>

2043
01:34:09.821 --> 01:34:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you must have encountered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2044
01:34:11.801 --> 01:34:12.400
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2045
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:13.750
<v Speaker 2>And how do you deal with it?</v>

2046
01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:18.840
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>luckily in the podcast I really didn't </v>

2047
01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:21.301
<v Speaker 5>encounter that much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Countered it outside of the podcast and </v>

2048
01:34:21.301 --> 01:34:22.000
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the reasons like doing fear </v>
<v Speaker 5>factor was a big one.</v>

2049
01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:24.100
<v Speaker 5>Like sometimes I would show up with </v>
<v Speaker 5>stubble and they'd be like,</v>

2050
01:34:24.101 --> 01:34:25.000
<v Speaker 5>you got to shave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

2051
01:34:25.001 --> 01:34:27.500
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do I have to shave somebody's gonna,</v>

2052
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:30.100
<v Speaker 5>wash your show and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this motherfucker didn't shave today.</v>

2053
01:34:30.101 --> 01:34:31.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm changing the channel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mike,</v>

2054
01:34:31.421 --> 01:34:33.310
<v Speaker 5>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>stop,</v>

2055
01:34:33.550 --> 01:34:35.070
<v Speaker 5>and we would have these arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2056
01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:37.430
<v Speaker 5>I'd have some stubble on my face and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they would tell me,</v>

2057
01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:38.620
<v Speaker 5>you could really got to shave.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2058
01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:41.590
<v Speaker 5>you can't tell me how to look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what I am.</v>

2059
01:34:41.591 --> 01:34:46.591
<v Speaker 5>Don't look ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a fucking big dildo poking </v>

2060
01:34:46.591 --> 01:34:46.720
<v Speaker 5>out of my forehead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's.</v>

2061
01:34:46.750 --> 01:34:48.520
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing unusual about how I </v>
<v Speaker 5>look.</v>

2062
01:34:48.521 --> 01:34:50.080
<v Speaker 5>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't get that right.</v>

2063
01:34:50.081 --> 01:34:51.550
<v Speaker 5>It's really fucked up when you think </v>
<v Speaker 5>about it.</v>

2064
01:34:51.670 --> 01:34:54.550
<v Speaker 2>Imagine right now if you and I were </v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing makeup,</v>

2065
01:34:55.150 --> 01:34:57.010
<v Speaker 2>looking at each other like powder and </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2066
01:34:57.030 --> 01:35:02.030
<v Speaker 2>like regulars awake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make regular guys having a conversation </v>

2067
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:03.190
<v Speaker 2>in makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so fucked up to think about.</v>

2068
01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:04.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you something.</v>

2069
01:35:04.071 --> 01:35:06.650
<v Speaker 2>There are podcasts where they put makeup</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the podcast.</v>

2070
01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:11.800
<v Speaker 2>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen a lady standing there and </v>

2071
01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:12.530
<v Speaker 2>she'll powder your forehead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know she'll.</v>

2072
01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.960
<v Speaker 2>She'll just go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put some anti shine on your</v>

2073
01:35:14.961 --> 01:35:15.690
<v Speaker 2>nose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>

2074
01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:20.700
<v Speaker 2>How pissed off must make people in in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the makeup hollywood makeup business be </v>

2075
01:35:20.701 --> 01:35:23.960
<v Speaker 2>at like youtube and online media as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers.</v>

2076
01:35:23.961 --> 01:35:25.640
<v Speaker 2>When they get the numbers and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize it's not.</v>

2077
01:35:25.730 --> 01:35:28.040
<v Speaker 2>You don't really have to make someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>that put a cartoon.</v>

2078
01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2079
01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:34.660
<v Speaker 2>you could make the argument that if our </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal is to connect with people on the </v>

2080
01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:37.871
<v Speaker 2>other end form these relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better to look to just in every way to </v>

2081
01:35:38.421 --> 01:35:43.421
<v Speaker 2>be as close as you can to the real you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's how you form </v>

2082
01:35:43.421 --> 01:35:43.421
<v Speaker 2>relationships in real life.</v>

2083
01:35:43.421 --> 01:35:47.620
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're never going to see people </v>
<v Speaker 2>in real life unless you're like one of </v>

2084
01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:48.890
<v Speaker 2>those instagram girls just it puts </v>
<v Speaker 2>filters on and it takes pictures.</v>

2085
01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:50.480
<v Speaker 2>Oversight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a dude who does that.</v>

2086
01:35:50.481 --> 01:35:55.481
<v Speaker 2>I know a comedian dude who does that </v>
<v Speaker 2>filters on his fucking pictures and you </v>

2087
01:35:55.481 --> 01:35:55.980
<v Speaker 2>look at them and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

2088
01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.900
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2089
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:58.910
<v Speaker 2>What's going on with your face?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a cartoon.</v>

2090
01:35:58.980 --> 01:35:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2091
01:35:59.781 --> 01:36:01.130
<v Speaker 2>You know what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

2092
01:36:01.131 --> 01:36:03.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the beauty mode,</v>

2093
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:07.730
<v Speaker 2>but it's on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's on a lot of korean devices,</v>

2094
01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:10.190
<v Speaker 2>korean devices specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

2095
01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:13.280
<v Speaker 2>I like samsung type things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>samsung type things,</v>

2096
01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:17.000
<v Speaker 2>lg type things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a beauty mode while you know,</v>

2097
01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:20.040
<v Speaker 2>you know what the situation now over </v>
<v Speaker 2>their vision,</v>

2098
01:36:20.610 --> 01:36:25.610
<v Speaker 2>regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do have a situation when it comes </v>

2099
01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:25.610
<v Speaker 2>to plastic surgery that's streamline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yap.</v>

2100
01:36:25.610 --> 01:36:26.810
<v Speaker 2>So that's where I'm going with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very bizarre.</v>

2101
01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:28.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

2102
01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:31.610
<v Speaker 2>It makes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this beauty mode,</v>

2103
01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:34.520
<v Speaker 2>it makes your eyes bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smooth into your skin.</v>

2104
01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.840
<v Speaker 2>It changes the color.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The complexion can lighten it up.</v>

2105
01:36:38.841 --> 01:36:43.841
<v Speaker 2>It's very bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it only work on lg and samsung ships </v>

2106
01:36:43.841 --> 01:36:47.981

2107
01:36:47.981 --> 01:36:47.981
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you get like a korean model,</v>

2108
01:36:47.981 --> 01:36:49.490
<v Speaker 2>a korean version of pretty much any </v>

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:51.680
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the default camera app is gonna.</v>

2110
01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:54.680
<v Speaker 2>It actually is going to have beauty mode</v>
<v Speaker 2>on by by default.</v>

2111
01:36:54.710 --> 01:36:55.550
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2112
01:36:55.551 --> 01:36:57.050
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be like default.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2113
01:36:57.051 --> 01:37:00.470

<v Speaker 2>five out of 10 potential beauty mode,</v>

2114
01:37:00.471 --> 01:37:05.471
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see these selfies or whatever it </v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2117
01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:11.480
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was one famous situation where </v>

2118
01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:12.140
<v Speaker 2>that chef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's the chef,</v>

2120
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:14.570
<v Speaker 2>the one who's always yelling.</v>

2121
01:37:15.810 --> 01:37:16.640
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2122
01:37:16.710 --> 01:37:17.230
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2123
01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:19.080
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one who's yelling at people like,</v>

2124
01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:21.310
<v Speaker 2>get out of my kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gordon ramsay,</v>

2125
01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:26.150
<v Speaker 2>gordon ramsay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the mom of the kardashians.</v>

2126
01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:27.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus.</v>

2127
01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:31.400
<v Speaker 2>What a combo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she took the photo filter out.</v>

2128
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:33.440
<v Speaker 2>They each took their own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of them,</v>

2129
01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:37.370
<v Speaker 2>somebody did like a comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2130
01:37:37.371 --> 01:37:39.680
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because she of course had a filter on.</v>

2131
01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being time made her look like an angel.</v>

2132
01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Big time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

2133
01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:45.190
<v Speaker 2>It's a good point though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2134
01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:50.200
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we continue to progress into this </v>

2135
01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.170
<v Speaker 2>digital realm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which one is the real you?</v>

2136
01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:56.220
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're hiding that we're hiding that </v>

2137
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:56.220
<v Speaker 2>reality with these filters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I.</v>

2138
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:56.220
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>

2139
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:56.870
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2140
01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:59.940
<v Speaker 3>There's her look at her face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at his.</v>

2141
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:03.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is so bizarre.</v>

2142
01:38:03.541 --> 01:38:06.240
<v Speaker 3>There's the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh jesus christ.</v>

2143
01:38:07.230 --> 01:38:08.820
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a difference.</v>

2144
01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.250
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like in a fog.</v>

2145
01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:16.360
<v Speaker 3>They're repeat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That mode of photographing people is so </v>

2146
01:38:16.441 --> 01:38:17.570
<v Speaker 3>creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I,</v>

2147
01:38:17.610 --> 01:38:19.260
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know a male comedian.</v>

2148
01:38:19.261 --> 01:38:20.540
<v Speaker 3>he used that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2149
01:38:21.090 --> 01:38:22.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'S all of it is weird.</v>

2150
01:38:22.741 --> 01:38:27.540
<v Speaker 3>Like I need to kind of in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he needs to set up some rules.</v>

2151
01:38:27.541 --> 01:38:29.310
<v Speaker 3>That's what I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need the rule book.</v>

2152
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:33.180
<v Speaker 3>We need the social media rule book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You definitely do.</v>

2153
01:38:33.370 --> 01:38:35.050
<v Speaker 3>You kind of have it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2154
01:38:35.060 --> 01:38:40.060
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we kind of have it in a way where a </v>

2155
01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:41.360
<v Speaker 3>personal qri there's a clear rule book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We look at that one outta here,</v>

2156
01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:43.800
<v Speaker 3>but it's unwritten.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is undermining to write it down.</v>

2157
01:38:43.890 --> 01:38:45.480
<v Speaker 3>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2158
01:38:45.481 --> 01:38:47.580
<v Speaker 3>and I know everybody knows that's true.</v>

2159
01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:49.350
<v Speaker 3>It is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is kind of fun that way,</v>

2160
01:38:49.410 --> 01:38:53.580
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like we could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe we could maybe save the situation.</v>

2161
01:38:53.581 --> 01:38:55.890
<v Speaker 3>We can saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to save it.</v>

2162
01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:58.410
<v Speaker 3>You want to leave them to be able to </v>

2180
01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:41.691
<v Speaker 3>the background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really dependent upon what you're </v>

2181
01:39:41.691 --> 01:39:42.330
<v Speaker 3>trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's never more than like a couple.</v>

<v Speaker 3>to achieve something very strange.</v>

2184

<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2189
01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:01.920

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2197
01:40:27.931 --> 01:40:32.931

<v Speaker 3>degree if I catch myself at 10 or </v>

2198
01:40:32.931 --> 01:40:37.191
<v Speaker 3>whatever the number is.</v>

2199
01:40:37.231 --> 01:40:42.231
<v Speaker 3>professional instagram girls taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>before they pick one to post the very </v>

2200
01:40:42.231 --> 01:40:42.480
<v Speaker 3>good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could it be 100?</v>

2201
01:40:42.990 --> 01:40:47.990
<v Speaker 3>Some of them it's probably shocking </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers and then some of them what's </v>

2202
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:51.231
<v Speaker 3>really weird because they're taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>these really like supposedly clandestine</v>

2203
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:53.950
<v Speaker 3>stein photos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like who's taken the photo?</v>

2204
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Like why do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you like looking off in the distance</v>

2205
01:40:56.801 --> 01:40:58.480
<v Speaker 2>whimsically like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's around.</v>

2206
01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:00.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking guy right there with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>camera.</v>

2207
01:41:00.521 --> 01:41:03.190
<v Speaker 2>You lying bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing here?</v>

2208
01:41:03.191 --> 01:41:06.910
<v Speaker 2>What are we selling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the early days of instagram,</v>

2209
01:41:07.150 --> 01:41:10.630
<v Speaker 2>one of the unwritten rules was only </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone photos,</v>

2210
01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:14.140
<v Speaker 2>like if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it didn't come off your phone,</v>

2211
01:41:14.141 --> 01:41:15.760
<v Speaker 2>you just broke the rules of instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2212
01:41:15.761 --> 01:41:17.650
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know there was a rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's again,</v>

2213
01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:19.690
<v Speaker 2>if I had joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had the book,</v>

2214
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:22.910
<v Speaker 2>you would know it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be on amazon.com.</v>

2215
01:41:23.570 --> 01:41:24.850
<v Speaker 2>There'll be kickstarting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

2216
01:41:24.851 --> 01:41:28.930
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy because that guy that sent </v>
<v Speaker 2>me these wolf put pictures.</v>

2217
01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It should pull up his,</v>

2218
01:41:30.781 --> 01:41:31.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his instagram.</v>

2219
01:41:31.811 --> 01:41:32.930
<v Speaker 2>So we could give this guy some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2220
01:41:32.931 --> 01:41:33.160
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2221
01:41:33.161 --> 01:41:33.760
<v Speaker 2>See.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2222
01:41:33.761 --> 01:41:38.761
<v Speaker 2>in his particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those obviously aren't phone photos and </v>

2223
01:41:38.761 --> 01:41:38.761
<v Speaker 2>he and he has broken the rules.</v>

2224
01:41:38.761 --> 01:41:43.140
<v Speaker 2>But that rule went away a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody did go because photos from </v>

2225
01:41:43.211 --> 01:41:45.190
<v Speaker 2>real cameras look amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2226
01:41:45.191 --> 01:41:46.240
<v Speaker 2>But this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2227
01:41:46.241 --> 01:41:47.800
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what your point is.</v>

2228
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2229
01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:53.550
<v Speaker 2>But why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would there be only photos from </v>

2230
01:41:53.550 --> 01:41:53.680
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's kind of like cheating,</v>

2231
01:41:53.681 --> 01:41:55.750
<v Speaker 2>like insta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram.</v>

2232
01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:57.820
<v Speaker 2>It should be like in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2233
01:41:57.821 --> 01:41:58.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2234
01:41:58.491 --> 01:42:03.491

<v Speaker 2>like this model overlooking cabo or </v>

2235
01:42:03.641 --> 01:42:05.560
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not instagram.</v>

2236
01:42:05.561 --> 01:42:06.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

2237
01:42:06.401 --> 01:42:11.401
<v Speaker 2>it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the early days it sure as hell </v>

2238
01:42:11.401 --> 01:42:13.451
<v Speaker 2>wasn't so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did people get upset when they saw like </v>

<v Speaker 2>a professional photography in days?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm getting tired of looking at elvis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2278
01:43:49.721 --> 01:43:52.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to decorate the back wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is,</v>

2279
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:55.970
<v Speaker 3>it's made out of metal on metal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's wild.</v>

2280
01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:02.920
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had one thing that I could look at </v>

2281
01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:02.920
<v Speaker 3>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I had only one kind of art,</v>

2282
01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:07.631
<v Speaker 3>it would absolutely be wildlife art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like wildlife art to me is the most </v>

2283
01:44:07.631 --> 01:44:08.540
<v Speaker 3>compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just something about,</v>

2284
01:44:08.541 --> 01:44:11.690
<v Speaker 3>especially like predators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like eagles and wolves.</v>

2285
01:44:11.691 --> 01:44:16.691
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that video was making the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rounds of the eagle today?</v>

2286
01:44:17.650 --> 01:44:19.580
<v Speaker 3>The cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2287
01:44:19.581 --> 01:44:21.230
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can probably tweeted it then.</v>

2288
01:44:21.610 --> 01:44:25.430
<v Speaker 3>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's funny when,</v>

2289
01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:27.470
<v Speaker 3>when you come up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I come on here,</v>

2290
01:44:27.471 --> 01:44:29.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time I'm referencing something I'm</v>

2291
01:44:29.561 --> 01:44:34.561
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did was posted that or was it somebody </v>

2292
01:44:34.561 --> 01:44:34.561
<v Speaker 3>else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2293
01:44:34.561 --> 01:44:34.561
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's uh,</v>

2294
01:44:34.561 --> 01:44:36.880
<v Speaker 3>it's weird how people have that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2295
01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:42.970
<v Speaker 3>how they have that perception of like </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature only applies to stuff that I </v>

2296
01:44:43.551 --> 01:44:44.860
<v Speaker 3>don't recognize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2297
01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:46.310
<v Speaker 3>Know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not a part of it.</v>

2298
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:51.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like eating a salmon is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but an eagle capturing a cat and feeding</v>

2299
01:44:51.591 --> 01:44:54.650
<v Speaker 3>it to his chicks [inaudible] not good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he had to,</v>

2300
01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:57.320
<v Speaker 3>I guess I was reading through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>article there and they had to say like,</v>

2301
01:44:57.321 --> 01:45:02.321
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cat was probably already dead and </v>

2302
01:45:02.321 --> 01:45:02.321
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bullshit.</v>

2303
01:45:02.321 --> 01:45:04.170
<v Speaker 3>They fucking scoop up cats all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>or why not?</v>

2304
01:45:04.190 --> 01:45:05.190
<v Speaker 3>That's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2305
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:06.740
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're weird.</v>

2306
01:45:06.741 --> 01:45:11.600
<v Speaker 3>We have a hierarchy of animals and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like cats and dogs.</v>

2307
01:45:11.601 --> 01:45:16.601
<v Speaker 3>Are they more favorable?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why that yulin dog festival in </v>

2308
01:45:16.601 --> 01:45:17.930
<v Speaker 3>China is so problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dog eating.</v>

2309
01:45:18.630 --> 01:45:19.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2310
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:21.630
<v Speaker 3>My brother ate dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2311
01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:22.010
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2312
01:45:22.011 --> 01:45:27.011
<v Speaker 3>he was hit China here and there and he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said that there was one point where </v>

2313
01:45:27.011 --> 01:45:27.590
<v Speaker 3>they were at a restaurant that all he </v>
<v Speaker 3>had was dog,</v>

2314
01:45:27.591 --> 01:45:30.860
<v Speaker 3>so he was all they had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a dog.</v>

2315
01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:34.160
<v Speaker 3>It was just dog restaurants like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kentucky fried chicken,</v>

2316
01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:37.830
<v Speaker 3>but dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kentucky fried dogs.</v>

2317
01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:39.810
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2318
01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:44.840
<v Speaker 3>It just is problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it comes back maybe full circle </v>

2319
01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:48.101
<v Speaker 3>to the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way that we started this </v>

2320
01:45:48.101 --> 01:45:48.101
<v Speaker 3>conversation just about people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the convenient,</v>

2321
01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:49.910
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to compartmentalize certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

2322
01:45:49.911 --> 01:45:52.790
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the way that's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's not a.</v>

2323
01:45:53.090 --> 01:45:58.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's a similar thing to what the </v>

2324
01:45:58.090 --> 01:45:58.090
<v Speaker 3>coyotes and me seeing a wolf here and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2325
01:45:58.090 --> 01:45:58.940
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2326
01:45:58.941 --> 01:46:01.040
<v Speaker 3>You get this reset of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit.</v>

2327
01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:04.130
<v Speaker 3>That's a natural.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It feels small and you can probably even</v>

2328
01:46:04.131 --> 01:46:09.131
<v Speaker 3>more so because you go out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you actually go out in the wilderness </v>

2329
01:46:09.131 --> 01:46:09.131
<v Speaker 3>and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go hunting and whatnot.</v>

2330
01:46:09.131 --> 01:46:09.131
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you.</v>

2331
01:46:09.131 --> 01:46:11.480
<v Speaker 3>It's a humbling experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assume it's very humbling.</v>

2332
01:46:11.510 --> 01:46:14.990
<v Speaker 3>It's very psychedelic and people think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that sounds crazy like going out to</v>

2333
01:46:14.991 --> 01:46:19.991
<v Speaker 3>kill an animal psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what psychedelic about it is its </v>

2334
01:46:19.991 --> 01:46:24.131
<v Speaker 3>boundary dissolving and that you enter </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a truly wild world and there was </v>

2335
01:46:24.131 --> 01:46:28.481
<v Speaker 3>these large animals that live in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>wild world and you feel their world.</v>

2336
01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:34.600
<v Speaker 3>There's no cell phone servIce out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in the woods with the trees and </v>

2337
01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:39.101
<v Speaker 3>the animals and you're a part of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural environment for a very brief </v>

2338
01:46:39.101 --> 01:46:39.860
<v Speaker 3>time and you know people like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2339
01:46:39.861 --> 01:46:41.870
<v Speaker 3>what would you want to go there and kill</v>
<v Speaker 3>those animals in this?</v>

2340
01:46:42.110 --> 01:46:47.110
<v Speaker 3>There's all these weird arguments that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you could have back and forth about </v>

2341
01:46:47.110 --> 01:46:50.141
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These conversations you can have about </v>

2342
01:46:50.141 --> 01:46:50.141
<v Speaker 3>whether or not it's okay to kill these </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

2343
01:46:50.141 --> 01:46:50.141
<v Speaker 3>What</v>

2344
01:46:50.730 --> 01:46:55.730
<v Speaker 5>I've.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've made these conversations with </v>

2345
01:46:55.730 --> 01:46:55.730
<v Speaker 5>myself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>believe me,</v>

2346
01:46:55.730 --> 01:46:55.730
<v Speaker 5>like before I started hunting for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first time,</v>

2347
01:46:55.770 --> 01:47:00.770
<v Speaker 5>my thought was I am either going to go </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunting and I'm going to never eat meat </v>

2348
01:47:01.111 --> 01:47:06.111
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to become vegan or I'm going </v>

2349
01:47:06.111 --> 01:47:07.941
<v Speaker 5>to be a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I decided to be a hunter and one of </v>

2350
01:47:07.941 --> 01:47:10.371
<v Speaker 5>the reasons why I decided to be a hunter</v>
<v Speaker 5>is I realized I don't like factory </v>

2351
01:47:10.371 --> 01:47:10.371
<v Speaker 5>farming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's fucked up.</v>

2352
01:47:10.371 --> 01:47:14.070
<v Speaker 5>I think the way we get our food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we've made a huge mistake.</v>

2353
01:47:14.670 --> 01:47:19.670
<v Speaker 5>It's a great decision,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a huge mistake at the same time in </v>

2354
01:47:19.670 --> 01:47:23.271
<v Speaker 5>that we've all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've decided to live in these gigantic </v>

2355
01:47:23.271 --> 01:47:27.950
<v Speaker 5>urban areas in these urban areas that </v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes our natural world and in that </v>

2356
01:47:27.950 --> 01:47:28.920
<v Speaker 5>natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't see tigers.</v>

2357
01:47:28.921 --> 01:47:30.930
<v Speaker 5>We don't see wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't see bears.</v>

2358
01:47:30.931 --> 01:47:32.400
<v Speaker 5>We don't see these animals.</v>

2359
01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:36.120
<v Speaker 5>So our association with these animals is</v>
<v Speaker 5>very unnatural.</v>

2360
01:47:36.150 --> 01:47:40.410
<v Speaker 5>Our world consists of streets and cars </v>
<v Speaker 5>and buildings and elevators,</v>

2361
01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:45.560
<v Speaker 5>and that's our natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the natural world that we live </v>

2362
01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:47.610
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you go out into the woods and you,</v>

2363
01:47:47.690 --> 01:47:52.680
<v Speaker 5>you see the actual natural world,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the tooth thing and claw natural world,</v>

2364
01:47:52.890 --> 01:47:57.890
<v Speaker 5>and you find mountain lions shit that </v>
<v Speaker 5>has hair in it and you look around and </v>

2365
01:47:57.890 --> 01:48:00.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see an elk at the top of a ridge and</v>

2366
01:48:00.151 --> 01:48:00.950
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2367
01:48:01.050 --> 01:48:05.340
<v Speaker 5>trying to fuck all these other cow elk </v>
<v Speaker 5>and trying to fight all these bowls that</v>

2368
01:48:05.341 --> 01:48:07.740
<v Speaker 5>are coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I mean we last time was elk hunting.</v>

2369
01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.000
<v Speaker 5>They had found a dead elk that had been </v>
<v Speaker 5>killed by another elk is thousand pound </v>

2370
01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.691
<v Speaker 5>animal that died because this other </v>
<v Speaker 5>animal with fucking a tree grown out of </v>

2371
01:48:17.731 --> 01:48:20.400
<v Speaker 5>it's head spirited in the side and </v>
<v Speaker 5>killed it.</v>

2372
01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:25.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really wild to see like these </v>

2373
01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:25.930
<v Speaker 5>things kill each other so they can fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you're,</v>

2374
01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:29.140
<v Speaker 5>you're out in that world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when,</v>

2375
01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:32.230
<v Speaker 5>when you do it makes everything seem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2376
01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:32.960
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2377
01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:38.080
<v Speaker 5>the whole predator prey experience seems</v>
<v Speaker 5>very intensified.</v>

2378
01:48:38.161 --> 01:48:43.161
<v Speaker 5>Like your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your connection to your food is very </v>

2379
01:48:43.161 --> 01:48:43.360
<v Speaker 5>intense.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the whole thing is like.</v>

2380
01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:47.780
<v Speaker 5>And also from a wildlife management </v>
<v Speaker 5>standpoint,</v>

2381
01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:50.820
<v Speaker 5>you kind of what we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>with lyme disease.</v>

2382
01:48:50.970 --> 01:48:53.580
<v Speaker 5>The reason why they have lyme disease,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because they have too many deer,</v>

2383
01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:55.470
<v Speaker 5>they have too many deer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have these ticks,</v>

2384
01:48:55.471 --> 01:48:58.530
<v Speaker 5>these ticks get on these deer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They developed this disease and this,</v>

2385
01:48:58.590 --> 01:49:01.710
<v Speaker 5>these ticks get onto people and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>because of an over abundance of dhea,</v>

2386
01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:06.750
<v Speaker 5>the overpopulation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can nip that shit in the bud if </v>

2387
01:49:06.750 --> 01:49:08.040
<v Speaker 5>they could figure out how to dwindle </v>
<v Speaker 5>down the population of deer.</v>

2388
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:11.610
<v Speaker 5>When you have too many animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>too many game animals,</v>

2389
01:49:11.611 --> 01:49:13.530
<v Speaker 5>too many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>too many wild animals,</v>

2390
01:49:13.531 --> 01:49:15.360
<v Speaker 5>and the balance gets over run.</v>

2391
01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:20.250
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's too many wolves are too </v>
<v Speaker 5>many bear or too many deer like wildlife</v>

2392
01:49:20.251 --> 01:49:25.251
<v Speaker 5>biologists understand what the correct </v>
<v Speaker 5>numbers are better to keep that harmony </v>

2393
01:49:25.251 --> 01:49:27.570
<v Speaker 5>and you have two options.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One option number one,</v>

2394
01:49:27.810 --> 01:49:29.280
<v Speaker 5>hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they pay money.</v>

2395
01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:34.520
<v Speaker 5>They go out there and the money from </v>
<v Speaker 5>those tags is responsible for the </v>

2396
01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:37.470
<v Speaker 5>protection of these wildlife areas,</v>
<v Speaker 5>protection of habitat,</v>

2397
01:49:37.650 --> 01:49:40.260
<v Speaker 5>or option number two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they hire snipers.</v>

2398
01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:45.440
<v Speaker 5>They hire people to go out there and </v>
<v Speaker 5>kill these animals and that's what </v>

2399
01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:45.440
<v Speaker 5>they're doing in Zimbabwe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>With lions,</v>

2400
01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:46.340
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're killing us.</v>

2401
01:49:46.650 --> 01:49:50.740
<v Speaker 5>They're killing 200 lions rather this </v>
<v Speaker 5>year because they have so many lions now</v>

2402
01:49:50.741 --> 01:49:54.850
<v Speaker 5>because of the the what happened with </v>
<v Speaker 5>the dentist or the dentist went over and</v>

2403
01:49:54.851 --> 01:49:55.480
<v Speaker 5>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cecil.</v>

2404
01:49:55.481 --> 01:49:57.400
<v Speaker 5>The lion became this big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2405
01:49:57.550 --> 01:50:02.550
<v Speaker 5>they had control of their population.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had this sort of ecosystem balanced</v>

2406
01:50:03.221 --> 01:50:06.010
<v Speaker 5>out and the hunter's got scared and </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunter's got scared.</v>

2407
01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:07.780
<v Speaker 5>They moved off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't.</v>

2408
01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:12.810
<v Speaker 5>They don't go there anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so now they have all these lines </v>

2409
01:50:12.810 --> 01:50:12.810
<v Speaker 5>that are destroying this undulate </v>
<v Speaker 5>population,</v>

2410
01:50:12.810 --> 01:50:17.430
<v Speaker 5>so they made a wildlife biologist </v>
<v Speaker 5>decision to go in there and killed 200 </v>

2411
01:50:17.430 --> 01:50:20.170
<v Speaker 5>lions to lessen the impact on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>undulates.</v>

2412
01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:24.070
<v Speaker 5>It's all in north America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They do that with bears and they do that</v>

2413
01:50:24.071 --> 01:50:29.071
<v Speaker 5>with mountain lions in most states.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They figure out what is the healthy </v>

2414
01:50:29.071 --> 01:50:29.980
<v Speaker 5>number or all these animals can coexist.</v>

2415
01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's.</v>

2416
01:50:30.770 --> 01:50:35.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's one thing to have an opinion</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that matter and it's a different </v>

2417
01:50:35.770 --> 01:50:38.600
<v Speaker 2>thing to actually have exposure and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain that opinion.</v>

2418
01:50:38.890 --> 01:50:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one thing to be on twitter,</v>

2419
01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:47.320
<v Speaker 2>sitting on your couch watching tv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying a couple words about how you </v>

2420
01:50:47.421 --> 01:50:50.240
<v Speaker 2>think about the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wilderness and so on.</v>

2421
01:50:50.530 --> 01:50:55.530
<v Speaker 2>He say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to maintain that perspective when </v>

2422
01:50:55.530 --> 01:50:55.530
<v Speaker 2>you're actually in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2423
01:50:55.530 --> 01:50:59.381
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to believe in speculate </v>

2424
01:50:59.381 --> 01:50:59.381
<v Speaker 2>that that's a difficult thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2425
01:50:59.381 --> 01:51:03.611
<v Speaker 2>there's a deep respect that comes in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep love for an animal that is going to</v>

2426
01:51:04.011 --> 01:51:06.140
<v Speaker 2>sustain you and feed you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

2427
01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:10.210
<v Speaker 5>the thing about it is these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not going to live forever if you</v>

2428
01:51:10.211 --> 01:51:12.850
<v Speaker 5>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their life is incredibly brutal,</v>

2429
01:51:12.890 --> 01:51:15.580
<v Speaker 5>incredibly short,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what you're doing as a hunter,</v>

2430
01:51:15.581 --> 01:51:20.581
<v Speaker 5>as you're going into that world and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're dipping your toes into it for a </v>

2431
01:51:20.581 --> 01:51:23.311
<v Speaker 5>brief amount of time a week or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 5>it takes to find an animal and the </v>

2432
01:51:23.311 --> 01:51:26.770
<v Speaker 5>animal's going to feed you for months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And to me it's so much more.</v>

2433
01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:29.680
<v Speaker 5>It's so much more ethical than buying it</v>
<v Speaker 5>from a store.</v>

2434
01:51:29.681 --> 01:51:31.390
<v Speaker 5>I mean that not even can't even be </v>
<v Speaker 5>argued,</v>

2435
01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:34.870
<v Speaker 5>but from a vegan perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they don't want anything to die.</v>

2436
01:51:34.871 --> 01:51:39.871
<v Speaker 5>They want everything to live forever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't work that way because </v>

2437
01:51:39.871 --> 01:51:39.871
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't shoot animals,</v>

2438
01:51:40.330 --> 01:51:41.400
<v Speaker 5>if you don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>

2439
01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:46.440
<v Speaker 5>if you don't control bear populations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the berrigan and decimate the moose </v>

2440
01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:49.861
<v Speaker 5>population,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to decimate the deer </v>

2441
01:51:49.861 --> 01:51:49.861
<v Speaker 5>population.</v>

2442
01:51:49.861 --> 01:51:49.861
<v Speaker 5>They eat all the calves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they eat all the fonz.</v>

2443
01:51:49.861 --> 01:51:51.130
<v Speaker 5>That's just what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what they've always done.</v>

2444
01:51:51.131 --> 01:51:52.060
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they go in,</v>

2445
01:51:52.061 --> 01:51:54.400
<v Speaker 5>they eat each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bears are all cannibals.</v>

2446
01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:58.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a massive amount of </v>
<v Speaker 5>cannibalism in in the bear world,</v>

2447
01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:03.900
<v Speaker 5>the cubs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the first things that males </v>

2448
01:52:03.900 --> 01:52:06.211
<v Speaker 5>do when they come out of hibernation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and if you don't control their </v>

2449
01:52:06.211 --> 01:52:07.600
<v Speaker 5>populations,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they will do that to every fucking thing</v>

2450
01:52:07.601 --> 01:52:12.601
<v Speaker 5>that's out in the woods and the only </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that can control their population </v>

2451
01:52:12.601 --> 01:52:16.141
<v Speaker 5>is another predator and the only </v>
<v Speaker 5>predator for bears is people sit and </v>

2452
01:52:16.141 --> 01:52:17.380
<v Speaker 5>that the people will go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What about people?</v>

2453
01:52:17.381 --> 01:52:18.640
<v Speaker 5>People who are over populated,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2454
01:52:18.850 --> 01:52:21.100
<v Speaker 5>why don't you fucking shoot people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but why don't you kill yourself?</v>

2455
01:52:21.370 --> 01:52:23.020
<v Speaker 5>How about I start with you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sounds about right.</v>

2456
01:52:23.330 --> 01:52:26.150
<v Speaker 5>You non human loving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>

2457
01:52:26.151 --> 01:52:30.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean like life eats life and that is a</v>
<v Speaker 5>weird reality.</v>

2458
01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:35.040
<v Speaker 2>There is a part of it though with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated part of it is that obviously</v>

2459
01:52:35.130 --> 01:52:38.460
<v Speaker 2>everybody can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2460
01:52:38.461 --> 01:52:39.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that is true,</v>

2461
01:52:39.331 --> 01:52:44.331
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>can't survive on the amount of money </v>

2462
01:52:44.911 --> 01:52:45.890
<v Speaker 2>that you make every year.</v>

2463
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:51.100
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't mean you should give up </v>
<v Speaker 5>that money because everybody can't make </v>

2464
01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:53.501
<v Speaker 5>the amount of money that you make.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you singling me out here for </v>

2465
01:52:53.501 --> 01:52:53.501
<v Speaker 5>anybody?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2466
01:52:53.501 --> 01:52:55.130
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you make more than $35,000</v>

2467
01:52:55.131 --> 01:53:00.131
<v Speaker 5>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in the top one percent of the </v>

2468
01:53:00.131 --> 01:53:00.131
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We live in a very strange time.</v>

2469
01:53:00.131 --> 01:53:00.580
<v Speaker 5>I just mean like I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think some people,</v>

2470
01:53:00.910 --> 01:53:04.850
<v Speaker 5>people's perspectives are formed by in </v>
<v Speaker 5>some ways their capabilities.</v>

2471
01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:08.450
<v Speaker 5>If all they ever knew it was going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>mcdonald's or whatever and it's just,</v>

2472
01:53:08.451 --> 01:53:13.451
<v Speaker 5>it's a hard thing to break.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a hard thing to break and it's a </v>

2473
01:53:13.451 --> 01:53:13.780
<v Speaker 5>hard thing to recognize that it can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2474
01:53:13.781 --> 01:53:16.190
<v Speaker 5>What will people say it's not </v>
<v Speaker 5>sustainable for the entire population?</v>

2475
01:53:16.191 --> 01:53:17.650
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not the entire population.</v>

2476
01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:22.700
<v Speaker 5>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what we're doing is not sustainable for </v>

2477
01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:22.700
<v Speaker 5>the entire population of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Actually,</v>

2478
01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:22.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2479
01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:24.410
<v Speaker 5>I'm kind of optimistic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if it's sustainable or not.</v>

2480
01:53:24.411 --> 01:53:25.670
<v Speaker 5>Sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hunting's not.</v>

2481
01:53:25.790 --> 01:53:29.060
<v Speaker 5>There's not enough animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's just not gotten pharma.</v>

2482
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:34.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you wanted to eat the way </v>

2483
01:53:34.270 --> 01:53:36.671
<v Speaker 5>people eat today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there has to be some sort of farming </v>

2484
01:53:36.671 --> 01:53:36.671
<v Speaker 5>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you want to eat it,</v>

2485
01:53:36.671 --> 01:53:38.960
<v Speaker 5>the amount of meat and people find that </v>
<v Speaker 5>problematic and that's for good reason.</v>

2486
01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:41.420
<v Speaker 5>There's a way to do the farming part </v>
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>

2487
01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:46.900
<v Speaker 5>Maybe there's certainly as,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's also problems with just </v>

2488
01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:48.050
<v Speaker 5>eating vegetables just to your </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetables.</v>

2489
01:53:48.051 --> 01:53:53.051
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to this place is massive amounts of </v>

2490
01:53:53.051 --> 01:53:53.051
<v Speaker 5>wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Second of all,</v>

2491
01:53:53.051 --> 01:53:53.840
<v Speaker 5>when you buy grain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're.</v>

2492
01:53:53.841 --> 01:53:57.320
<v Speaker 5>You are responsible indirectly for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>death of thousands of animals.</v>

2493
01:53:57.350 --> 01:54:02.350
<v Speaker 5>There's just no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those combines are indiscriminate and </v>

2494
01:54:02.350 --> 01:54:02.350
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2495
01:54:02.350 --> 01:54:05.990
<v Speaker 5>they grind up deer fawns and rabbits and</v>
<v Speaker 5>rats and mice and groundhogs and </v>

2496
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.380
<v Speaker 5>everything else.</v>

2497
01:54:06.590 --> 01:54:08.660
<v Speaker 5>Then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>pesticides,</v>

2498
01:54:09.010 --> 01:54:10.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean if you,</v>

2499
01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:13.610
<v Speaker 5>unless you're buying absolute organic </v>
<v Speaker 5>where there's no pesticides used,</v>

2500
01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:18.440
<v Speaker 5>your for sure going to be responsible </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the death of millions of bucks.</v>

2501
01:54:18.441 --> 01:54:20.180
<v Speaker 5>If you live in a house,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you display.</v>

2502
01:54:20.210 --> 01:54:25.210
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like everybody's fucking with animals </v>

2503
01:54:25.210 --> 01:54:27.580
<v Speaker 5>and on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's some very real and compelling </v>

2504
01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:29.660
<v Speaker 5>evidence that plants have a level of </v>
<v Speaker 5>intelligence.</v>

2505
01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:32.930
<v Speaker 5>We don't want to think of them as </v>
<v Speaker 5>sentience because they can't communicate</v>

2506
01:54:32.931 --> 01:54:37.931
<v Speaker 5>with us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't say anything to us like out </v>

2507
01:54:37.931 --> 01:54:37.931
<v Speaker 5>on chop me down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It hurts,</v>

2508
01:54:37.931 --> 01:54:40.840
<v Speaker 5>but they communicate with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something that plants do now.</v>

2509
01:54:40.850 --> 01:54:45.850
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a crazy thing that they found </v>

2510
01:54:45.850 --> 01:54:45.850
<v Speaker 5>with giraffes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that the plants that giraffes eat,</v>

2511
01:54:45.850 --> 01:54:50.800
<v Speaker 5>if they're downwind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like if the giraffes are eating this </v>

2512
01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:53.591
<v Speaker 5>plant and the wind from the plant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're eating goes downwind and catches</v>

2513
01:54:53.811 --> 01:54:55.520
<v Speaker 5>these other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these other plants,</v>

2514
01:54:55.790 --> 01:55:00.790
<v Speaker 5>the plants will change the chemical </v>
<v Speaker 5>composition of their leaves and become </v>

2515
01:55:00.790 --> 01:55:04.271
<v Speaker 5>more bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>making them less attractive to </v>

2516
01:55:04.271 --> 01:55:04.271
<v Speaker 5>predation.</v>

2517
01:55:04.271 --> 01:55:06.110
<v Speaker 5>So they're communicating with each other</v>
<v Speaker 5>like telepathic.</v>

2518
01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:08.990
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember what planet was that </v>
<v Speaker 5>does that,</v>

2519
01:55:09.290 --> 01:55:14.290
<v Speaker 5>but they have proven that plants do </v>
<v Speaker 5>calculations that plants are doing some </v>

2520
01:55:14.871 --> 01:55:19.871
<v Speaker 5>sort of some kind of strange mathematics</v>
<v Speaker 5>that they're communicating with each </v>

2521
01:55:19.871 --> 01:55:24.311
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know and other plants are being </v>

2522
01:55:24.311 --> 01:55:24.830
<v Speaker 5>chopped down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's some shit going on with life and</v>

2523
01:55:24.831 --> 01:55:29.831
<v Speaker 5>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't have the capability to </v>

2524
01:55:29.831 --> 01:55:29.831
<v Speaker 5>understand dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2525
01:55:29.831 --> 01:55:34.240
<v Speaker 5>We don't know what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When dolphins communicate with each </v>

2526
01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:34.240
<v Speaker 5>other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have a complex language.</v>

2527
01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:38.560
<v Speaker 5>They have dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they sound differently in different </v>

2528
01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:38.560
<v Speaker 5>parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They recognize each other.</v>

2529
01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:41.690
<v Speaker 5>They have a very bizarre way of </v>
<v Speaker 5>communicating that we have not been able</v>

2530
01:55:41.691 --> 01:55:46.691
<v Speaker 5>to decipher,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we recognize that that's going on </v>

2531
01:55:46.691 --> 01:55:49.860
<v Speaker 5>because it's close enough to our own </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of communication that we say,</v>

2532
01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:54.920
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these things are smart and they're </v>

2533
01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:54.920
<v Speaker 5>talking to each other.</v>

2534
01:55:54.920 --> 01:55:57.920
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's something going on with plants </v>

2535
01:55:57.920 --> 01:55:59.691
<v Speaker 5>too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and this is a recent thing with a </v>

2536
01:55:59.691 --> 01:56:00.180
<v Speaker 5>science behind it is starting to catch </v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

2537
01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:05.420
<v Speaker 5>Whether it's emerging,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether they're doing these tasks and </v>

2538
01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:05.420
<v Speaker 5>they're running these numbers and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

2539
01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:06.030
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not.</v>

2540
01:56:06.210 --> 01:56:09.570
<v Speaker 5>They're not wooden in the sense that </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not like you're not talking about a</v>

2541
01:56:09.571 --> 01:56:14.571
<v Speaker 5>rock like a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A living plant has some sort of </v>

2542
01:56:14.571 --> 01:56:16.710
<v Speaker 5>awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's something going on and different</v>

2543
01:56:16.711 --> 01:56:21.711
<v Speaker 5>ones have more awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in there's some sort of </v>

2544
01:56:21.711 --> 01:56:24.090
<v Speaker 5>communication through the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the actual ecology of the ground.</v>

2545
01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:27.360
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ground itself is a living thing.</v>

2546
01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:31.010
<v Speaker 5>Dirt itself is some sort of an organism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2547
01:56:31.090 --> 01:56:36.090
<v Speaker 5>Mean it is a like a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a person is like a person is an </v>

2548
01:56:36.090 --> 01:56:39.411
<v Speaker 5>ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're responsible for the lives of </v>

2549
01:56:39.411 --> 01:56:42.510
<v Speaker 5>untold trillions of bacteria that live </v>
<v Speaker 5>inside of us.</v>

2550
01:56:42.511 --> 01:56:43.170
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2551
01:56:43.171 --> 01:56:45.510
<v Speaker 5>that's the same thing can be said of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>dirt itself.</v>

2552
01:56:45.690 --> 01:56:50.690
<v Speaker 5>The dirt itself as some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>strange balanced ecosystem were worms </v>

2553
01:56:50.701 --> 01:56:55.701
<v Speaker 5>and bacteria and all of these different </v>
<v Speaker 5>funguses and all these different </v>

2554
01:56:55.701 --> 01:56:59.960
<v Speaker 5>lifeforms all exist together and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>the plant feeds off of those life forms </v>

2555
01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:05.480
<v Speaker 5>and the plant in some respects relies on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the death of biological things like </v>

2556
01:57:06.151 --> 01:57:10.950
<v Speaker 5>mammals and rats and bugs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It relies on them for the very nutrients</v>

2557
01:57:10.951 --> 01:57:13.680
<v Speaker 5>that it needs to make a plant in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first place.</v>

2558
01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:16.080
<v Speaker 5>It's all very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very complex.</v>

2559
01:57:16.081 --> 01:57:20.460
<v Speaker 5>All connected.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all connected and to deny that your</v>

2560
01:57:20.461 --> 01:57:25.461
<v Speaker 5>eating life some strange life form when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're having a salad is the height of </v>

2561
01:57:25.531 --> 01:57:30.531
<v Speaker 5>convenience.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing wrong with eating a </v>

2562
01:57:30.531 --> 01:57:30.750
<v Speaker 5>salad,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think there's anything wrong</v>

2563
01:57:30.751 --> 01:57:35.751
<v Speaker 5>with eating and elk steak either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Life is consuming life and it's just </v>

2564
01:57:35.761 --> 01:57:38.880
<v Speaker 5>more obvious when you shoot an animal </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're there when it died.</v>

2565
01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:44.080
<v Speaker 2>What about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about when humans find a way to </v>

2566
01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:48.611
<v Speaker 2>grow meat in a lab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be very interesting and </v>

2567
01:57:48.611 --> 01:57:48.611
<v Speaker 2>they kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're right there.</v>

2568
01:57:48.630 --> 01:57:53.630
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember reading something about they </v>

2569
01:57:53.630 --> 01:57:54.650
<v Speaker 2>had the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had the meat ready to go,</v>

2570
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:59.950
<v Speaker 2>but they couldn't actually consume it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the governing body or whatever </v>

2571
01:57:59.950 --> 01:58:01.940
<v Speaker 2>for for food and beverage or whoever the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hell it is,</v>

2572
01:58:02.210 --> 01:58:05.360
<v Speaker 2>said that it would be illegal to consume</v>
<v Speaker 2>it for some reason.</v>

2573
01:58:05.361 --> 01:58:08.270
<v Speaker 2>I can some probably some food lobby or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2574
01:58:08.271 --> 01:58:09.320
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2575
01:58:09.530 --> 01:58:10.690
<v Speaker 2>but theoretically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2576
01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:13.730
<v Speaker 2>We could find a way to manufacture all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this shit.</v>

2577
01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:14.950
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2578
01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:20.000
<v Speaker 2>we can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where there's going to be away and then </v>

2579
01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:20.000
<v Speaker 2>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we do at wildlife?</v>

2580
01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:20.000
<v Speaker 2>Then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question.</v>

2581
01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Well here's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a better question,</v>

2582
01:58:21.410 --> 01:58:23.650
<v Speaker 2>what do we do when we have robot fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>dolls and there's no,</v>

2583
01:58:23.670 --> 01:58:26.310
<v Speaker 2>no need to date to what would happen.</v>

2584
01:58:26.670 --> 01:58:27.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2585
01:58:27.670 --> 01:58:28.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're already there.</v>

2586
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:30.860
<v Speaker 2>We're pretty close because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2587
01:58:30.861 --> 01:58:32.960
<v Speaker 2>it's not a robot fuck doll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you have,</v>

2588
01:58:33.410 --> 01:58:35.860
<v Speaker 2>you have porn already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which many people,</v>

2589
01:58:35.900 --> 01:58:39.180
<v Speaker 2>many people consider to be one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of uh,</v>

2590
01:58:40.290 --> 01:58:42.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stone building blocks.</v>

2591
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.890
<v Speaker 2>That's where I was looking for building </v>
<v Speaker 2>blocks of the web,</v>

2592
01:58:44.891 --> 01:58:49.270
<v Speaker 2>like the reason that the web was adopted</v>
<v Speaker 2>or vhs or dvds or whatever.</v>

2593
01:58:49.480 --> 01:58:52.300
<v Speaker 2>Html five and it all goes the way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>porn.</v>

2594
01:58:52.410 --> 01:58:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Porn adopts that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

2595
01:58:53.531 --> 01:58:58.531
<v Speaker 2>Everything else follows the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental needs that people have and </v>

2596
01:58:58.531 --> 01:58:59.880
<v Speaker 2>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so yeah,</v>

2597
01:58:59.881 --> 01:59:04.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to wonder how </v>
<v Speaker 2>disconnected from other people we can,</v>

2598
01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:06.820
<v Speaker 2>we can get as this stuff continues to </v>
<v Speaker 2>improve.</v>

2599
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:10.210
<v Speaker 2>We were looking earlier at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this hollow lens development kit.</v>

2600
01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:12.760
<v Speaker 2>I was recently playing with the htc </v>
<v Speaker 2>vive,</v>

2601
01:59:12.761 --> 01:59:17.761
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably the vr headset to get </v>

2602
01:59:17.761 --> 01:59:18.010
<v Speaker 2>right now and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2603
01:59:18.580 --> 01:59:23.580
<v Speaker 2>these experiences are getting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting closer and you look at </v>

2604
01:59:23.580 --> 01:59:25.420
<v Speaker 2>the camera that facebook just came out </v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2605
01:59:25.421 --> 01:59:26.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like 60,000</v>

2606
01:59:26.591 --> 01:59:26.890
<v Speaker 2>bucks.</v>

2607
01:59:27.160 --> 01:59:32.160
<v Speaker 2>Facebook buying oculus has to be one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the creepiest things on the planet like </v>

2608
01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:38.100
<v Speaker 2>to know that they see where that's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that they were interested in that </v>

2609
01:59:38.100 --> 01:59:40.330
<v Speaker 2>and what their sort of agenda and </v>
<v Speaker 2>objectives are currently.</v>

2610
01:59:40.350 --> 01:59:41.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual communities,</v>

2611
01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:46.680
<v Speaker 2>that's what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all going to be able to sync up </v>

2612
01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:49.021
<v Speaker 2>together and some virtual place and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll all be like low calorie takers at </v>

2613
01:59:49.021 --> 01:59:53.401
<v Speaker 2>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all going to look like asian </v>

2614
01:59:53.401 --> 01:59:53.401
<v Speaker 2>supermodels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>text.</v>

2615
01:59:53.401 --> 01:59:56.760
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to go there and we're all </v>

2616
01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:58.471
<v Speaker 2>going to sync up with each other and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're probably going to be able to fuck </v>

2617
01:59:58.471 --> 01:59:58.471
<v Speaker 2>each other in some sort of a virtual </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

2618
01:59:58.471 --> 01:59:59.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like total recall,</v>

2619
01:59:59.321 --> 02:00:02.110
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is it's actually tone that</v>

2620
02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:03.300
<v Speaker 2>is going to be playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got a really,</v>

2621
02:00:03.310 --> 02:00:04.800
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really nice guy.</v>

2622
02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:10.320
<v Speaker 2>The thing is like the physiology part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is only part part of the conversation</v>

2623
02:00:10.601 --> 02:00:15.601
<v Speaker 2>does also the psychological part in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most part I feel like there's a </v>

2624
02:00:16.421 --> 02:00:16.990
<v Speaker 2>trade off.</v>

2625
02:00:17.020 --> 02:00:22.020
<v Speaker 2>I feel like women in my life make me </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than I would be if they </v>

2626
02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:25.771
<v Speaker 2>weren't in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent and in many ways I </v>

2627
02:00:25.771 --> 02:00:25.771
<v Speaker 2>think they make me a more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a more,</v>

2628
02:00:25.771 --> 02:00:30.690
<v Speaker 2>a more moderate person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like about the way I think about a lot </v>

2629
02:00:30.690 --> 02:00:31.580
<v Speaker 2>of things because you want to fuck and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want whatever,</v>

2630
02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:36.040
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the reasoning is the biological</v>

2631
02:00:36.041 --> 02:00:41.041
<v Speaker 2>part pulls you in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there's a psychological </v>

2632
02:00:41.041 --> 02:00:42.220
<v Speaker 2>aftermath of you now being a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>person because of the.</v>

2633
02:00:42.760 --> 02:00:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Because of the moves you made in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place and then there's a </v>

2634
02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:48.250
<v Speaker 2>compromise you have to figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much do you compromise?</v>

2635
02:00:48.251 --> 02:00:50.410
<v Speaker 2>Like do you become some sort of henpeck </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch?</v>

2636
02:00:50.411 --> 02:00:55.411
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we know a lot of guys that are </v>

2637
02:00:55.411 --> 02:00:57.480
<v Speaker 2>bitches because they've given in to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggression of their mate like they're </v>

2638
02:00:57.480 --> 02:00:58.060
<v Speaker 2>made is the dominant one in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

2639
02:00:58.330 --> 02:01:00.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a relative like that.</v>

2640
02:01:00.011 --> 02:01:01.900
<v Speaker 2>I have an uncle like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a wife,</v>

2641
02:01:01.901 --> 02:01:04.840
<v Speaker 2>it just runs the ship and everybody just</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets the fuck out of the way.</v>

2642
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:09.870
<v Speaker 2>So part part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of me worries though that like in </v>

2643
02:01:09.870 --> 02:01:12.901
<v Speaker 2>the absence of those interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens to the psyche of males and </v>

2644
02:01:14.621 --> 02:01:19.621
<v Speaker 2>females now just kind of allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathe in their own perspective over and </v>

2645
02:01:20.681 --> 02:01:23.530
<v Speaker 2>over and over again and never have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make those adjustments and never have to</v>

2646
02:01:23.531 --> 02:01:27.510
<v Speaker 2>make those compromises because </v>
<v Speaker 2>historically that's.</v>

2647
02:01:27.850 --> 02:01:30.880
<v Speaker 2>That hasn't really been a good sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You send a bunch of guys into,</v>

2648
02:01:30.881 --> 02:01:35.881
<v Speaker 2>into jail without any females or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>send them off to war without any </v>

2649
02:01:35.881 --> 02:01:36.490
<v Speaker 2>females.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They become fucking savages,</v>

2650
02:01:36.491 --> 02:01:41.491
<v Speaker 2>pretty god damn quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So is that what's going to happen is </v>

2651
02:01:41.491 --> 02:01:45.660
<v Speaker 2>just it's the digital onslaught going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create some kind of hyper aggressive </v>

2652
02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:45.660
<v Speaker 2>male.</v>

2653
02:01:45.980 --> 02:01:48.330
<v Speaker 2>It may do the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2654
02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:53.440
<v Speaker 2>it may do the opposite because all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your sexual needs will be satisfied so </v>

2655
02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:55.610
<v Speaker 2>easily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so easily that you'll be satiated.</v>

2656
02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:00.960
<v Speaker 2>So your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your need for sex is not going to be </v>

2657
02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:04.991
<v Speaker 2>there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe your need for posturing and </v>

2658
02:02:04.991 --> 02:02:07.481
<v Speaker 2>aggression won't be there anymore </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the need for like for you to be </v>

2659
02:02:07.481 --> 02:02:09.530
<v Speaker 2>preferable to the other men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to posture,</v>

2660
02:02:09.531 --> 02:02:11.720
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to peacock.</v>

2661
02:02:11.810 --> 02:02:16.810
<v Speaker 2>And if you could just put on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook virtual reality headset and go </v>

2662
02:02:16.810 --> 02:02:19.820
<v Speaker 2>fuck the asian supermodel and another </v>
<v Speaker 2>dimension like why would you be with you</v>

2663
02:02:19.821 --> 02:02:24.821
<v Speaker 2>on that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what about never having to </v>

2664
02:02:24.821 --> 02:02:24.821
<v Speaker 2>compromise?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem.</v>

2665
02:02:24.821 --> 02:02:26.000
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we talked before,</v>

2666
02:02:26.001 --> 02:02:31.001
<v Speaker 2>but all these people that suck because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to control everything about </v>

2667
02:02:31.001 --> 02:02:33.080
<v Speaker 2>their lives because they don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with people.</v>

2668
02:02:33.130 --> 02:02:34.310
<v Speaker 2>All got to be their way.</v>

2669
02:02:34.370 --> 02:02:39.370
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is this lineup?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is this car in front of </v>

2670
02:02:39.370 --> 02:02:39.370
<v Speaker 2>me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

2671
02:02:39.370 --> 02:02:39.370
<v Speaker 2>They said that they want to complain </v>
<v Speaker 2>about everything.</v>

2672
02:02:39.370 --> 02:02:42.920
<v Speaker 2>I want to sue this person over here and </v>
<v Speaker 2>do this over there and in an environment</v>

2673
02:02:42.921 --> 02:02:47.921
<v Speaker 2>where we take that a step further and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now we never compromised for other </v>

2674
02:02:47.921 --> 02:02:48.740
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we do emerge,</v>

2675
02:02:48.770 --> 02:02:52.260
<v Speaker 2>emerge from our headset world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

2676
02:02:52.261 --> 02:02:55.130
<v Speaker 2>What is our personality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good question because like what?</v>

2677
02:02:55.140 --> 02:03:00.140
<v Speaker 2>What does our personality based on most </v>
<v Speaker 2>of our personality is based on the long </v>

2678
02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:04.571
<v Speaker 2>running equation of your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the interactions you've ever had </v>

2679
02:03:04.571 --> 02:03:08.711
<v Speaker 2>with other people and how they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>reacted to you and how you've adjusted </v>

2680
02:03:08.711 --> 02:03:08.711
<v Speaker 2>your personality accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2681
02:03:08.711 --> 02:03:10.970
<v Speaker 2>there's a cool this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is reminding me of something.</v>

2682
02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:14.150
<v Speaker 2>There's a cool a channel on youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>called smarter everyday.</v>

2683
02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:15.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever heard of.</v>

2684
02:03:15.570 --> 02:03:16.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a guy,</v>

2685
02:03:16.671 --> 02:03:18.770
<v Speaker 2>he's a scientist and he does these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2686
02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:21.500
<v Speaker 2>he does these videos that sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2687
02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:26.940
<v Speaker 2>a attack sort of everyday things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>might seem obvious but then break them </v>

2688
02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:29.960
<v Speaker 2>down a little bit and what he did a </v>
<v Speaker 2>video about a bicycle.</v>

2689
02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:32.840
<v Speaker 2>And what happened was this was a bicycle</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

2690
02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:35.630
<v Speaker 2>had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a gear in the steering.</v>

2691
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:38.990
<v Speaker 2>So that left was now wright and wright </v>
<v Speaker 2>was now left.</v>

2692
02:03:39.080 --> 02:03:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember this.</v>

2693
02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:44.630
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you've seen this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he did was he took this bicycle</v>

2694
02:03:44.631 --> 02:03:48.920
<v Speaker 2>around various talks that he was giving </v>
<v Speaker 2>a different universities and stuff.</v>

2695
02:03:49.250 --> 02:03:54.250
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he made a bet to people in the </v>

2696
02:03:54.250 --> 02:03:56.861
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you $100 that nobody in here can </v>

2697
02:03:56.861 --> 02:03:57.290
<v Speaker 2>ride this bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course every time he got somebody</v>

2698
02:03:57.291 --> 02:03:58.090
<v Speaker 2>coming up going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>

2699
02:03:58.130 --> 02:03:59.060
<v Speaker 2>I can do it easily.</v>

2700
02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:01.430
<v Speaker 2>Whatever they get on the bike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't pedal it once,</v>

2701
02:04:01.990 --> 02:04:06.990
<v Speaker 2>even even though they are completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>aware of what change has been made to </v>

2702
02:04:06.990 --> 02:04:10.331
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he spent six months before he </v>

2703
02:04:10.331 --> 02:04:11.090
<v Speaker 2>could actually get down the street on </v>
<v Speaker 2>his bike.</v>

2704
02:04:11.091 --> 02:04:16.091
<v Speaker 2>That was reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what he talks about in the video is </v>

2705
02:04:16.091 --> 02:04:19.301
<v Speaker 2>about how he has the pathways that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>had created in his mind for how to ride </v>

2706
02:04:20.391 --> 02:04:21.740
<v Speaker 2>a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2707
02:04:21.741 --> 02:04:24.620
<v Speaker 2>Were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were very difficult to rewrite that.</v>

2708
02:04:24.621 --> 02:04:25.970
<v Speaker 2>Once they're in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in there.</v>

2709
02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:29.900
<v Speaker 2>And so he did an experiment where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>took his eight year old,</v>

2710
02:04:29.901 --> 02:04:34.901
<v Speaker 2>I want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who had just recently learned how to </v>

2711
02:04:34.901 --> 02:04:34.901
<v Speaker 2>ride a bike the right way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave him the same bike.</v>

2712
02:04:34.901 --> 02:04:36.890
<v Speaker 2>And in a couple of weeks he had it down </v>
<v Speaker 2>the kid.</v>

2713
02:04:36.930 --> 02:04:41.930
<v Speaker 2>The kid could write either bike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could ride the reverse bike or the </v>

2714
02:04:41.930 --> 02:04:43.770
<v Speaker 2>regular bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he was building this kind of,</v>

2715
02:04:43.771 --> 02:04:45.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2716
02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:50.750
<v Speaker 2>perspective that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but potentially when it comes to </v>

2717
02:04:50.750 --> 02:04:50.750
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to learning,</v>

2718
02:04:50.750 --> 02:04:54.471
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the absence of those pathways for </v>

2719
02:04:54.471 --> 02:04:57.330
<v Speaker 2>young people actually makes them more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2720
02:04:57.780 --> 02:04:59.010
<v Speaker 2>flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2721
02:04:59.540 --> 02:05:04.540
<v Speaker 2>A greater ability to change their way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking on a more frequent basis </v>

2722
02:05:04.540 --> 02:05:05.070
<v Speaker 2>because he was looking big picture at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2723
02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:09.270
<v Speaker 2>And the funny thing is when he went back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go back to the regular bike,</v>

2724
02:05:09.590 --> 02:05:12.560
<v Speaker 5>he couldn't ride the regular bike.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hm.</v>

2725
02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:14.780
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't make any.</v>

2726
02:05:14.810 --> 02:05:15.530
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he's retarded.</v>

2727
02:05:16.170 --> 02:05:17.870
<v Speaker 2>If that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I doubt it though.</v>

2728
02:05:17.871 --> 02:05:19.720
<v Speaker 2>He's a really smart guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I doubt it though.</v>

2729
02:05:19.730 --> 02:05:21.920
<v Speaker 2>He talked to a bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might just be on gordon dated.</v>

2730
02:05:22.250 --> 02:05:24.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like I would like to see the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bike.</v>

2731
02:05:25.010 --> 02:05:30.010
<v Speaker 2>We're getting you the bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to see the same thing with an </v>

2732
02:05:30.010 --> 02:05:32.891
<v Speaker 2>athlete that they could figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they might have a better </v>

2733
02:05:32.891 --> 02:05:32.891
<v Speaker 2>understanding of how their body works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

2734
02:05:32.891 --> 02:05:36.170
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how critical the test was.</v>

2735
02:05:36.171 --> 02:05:38.660
<v Speaker 2>I think he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a number of test subjects</v>

2736
02:05:38.830 --> 02:05:40.690
<v Speaker 5>because I just feel like it's like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>boat,</v>

2737
02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:42.520
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when you're steering a boat,</v>

2738
02:05:42.580 --> 02:05:46.240
<v Speaker 5>if you want to go right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you turn the rudder left.</v>

2739
02:05:46.700 --> 02:05:51.700
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like if you have an outboard motor </v>

2740
02:05:51.700 --> 02:05:51.700
<v Speaker 5>behind you and you want to go to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

2741
02:05:51.700 --> 02:05:51.700
<v Speaker 5>you have to go again.</v>

2742
02:05:51.700 --> 02:05:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Conceptually it makes complete sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the fact that it's actually,</v>

2743
02:05:55.240 --> 02:05:56.230
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it is.</v>

2744
02:05:56.500 --> 02:05:59.290
<v Speaker 2>It's actually not the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know how it's working.</v>

2745
02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:04.320
<v Speaker 2>It's the fact that you are keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>triggering back into that state of mind </v>

2746
02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:05.680
<v Speaker 2>of riding a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're riding a bike,</v>

2747
02:06:05.681 --> 02:06:08.740
<v Speaker 2>you're not thinking about riding a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just writing it.</v>

2748
02:06:09.700 --> 02:06:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can watch it.</v>

2749
02:06:12.281 --> 02:06:15.130
<v Speaker 2>Please send a bunch of people fail in in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual video.</v>

2750
02:06:15.180 --> 02:06:17.640
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it makes complete sense because pathways</v>

2751
02:06:17.820 --> 02:06:22.080
<v Speaker 5>that you've developed are incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 5>difficult to break and one of the things</v>

2752
02:06:22.110 --> 02:06:27.110
<v Speaker 5>that when I was teaching martial arts I </v>
<v Speaker 5>found was it's way easier to teach a </v>

2753
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:30.420
<v Speaker 5>person who has no martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience whatsoever.</v>

2754
02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:35.720
<v Speaker 5>Then a person who studied a different </v>
<v Speaker 5>style where they might be using bad </v>

2755
02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:38.580
<v Speaker 5>mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they developed bad mechanics and then</v>

2756
02:06:38.610 --> 02:06:43.610
<v Speaker 5>they came to a really good school.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was incredibly difficult to break </v>

2757
02:06:43.610 --> 02:06:47.691
<v Speaker 5>them of their bad habits.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if I could get two people and </v>

2758
02:06:47.691 --> 02:06:51.891
<v Speaker 5>one person was um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they save one person maybe even had a </v>

2759
02:06:51.891 --> 02:06:54.420
<v Speaker 5>black belt in one style and one person </v>
<v Speaker 5>was a white belt.</v>

2760
02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:59.870
<v Speaker 5>I feel like if the black belt had bad </v>
<v Speaker 5>technique and bad form and bad,</v>

2761
02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:05.270
<v Speaker 5>bad mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I could watch the two of them </v>

2762
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:08.901
<v Speaker 5>progress over a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eventually the white belt would surpass </v>

2763
02:07:08.901 --> 02:07:12.600
<v Speaker 5>the black belt and move forward and be </v>
<v Speaker 5>able to reach their full potential where</v>

2764
02:07:12.601 --> 02:07:15.570
<v Speaker 5>the black belt with bad mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though they might know how to fight</v>

2765
02:07:15.571 --> 02:07:20.571
<v Speaker 5>good because they might know what they </v>
<v Speaker 5>can do and even though what they're </v>

2766
02:07:20.571 --> 02:07:22.050
<v Speaker 5>doing is not optimized with the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>effective technique.</v>

2767
02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:27.320
<v Speaker 5>They know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how it works and how it fits in the </v>

2768
02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:30.321
<v Speaker 5>language of the community.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I think fighting is kind of like a </v>

2769
02:07:30.321 --> 02:07:30.660
<v Speaker 5>language.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And even with like your shitty words and</v>

2770
02:07:30.661 --> 02:07:35.661
<v Speaker 5>your bad grammar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could still form a sentence and </v>

2771
02:07:35.661 --> 02:07:38.361
<v Speaker 5>still talk and communicate with people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's similar to the articulation of a </v>

2772
02:07:38.361 --> 02:07:42.451
<v Speaker 5>real polished technical martial artist </v>
<v Speaker 5>versus a person with a very limited </v>

2773
02:07:42.451 --> 02:07:44.150
<v Speaker 5>vocabulary with street knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2774
02:07:44.151 --> 02:07:49.151
<v Speaker 5>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the person with the polish vocabulary </v>

2775
02:07:49.151 --> 02:07:51.751
<v Speaker 5>will be able to express themselves more </v>
<v Speaker 5>clearly and expressing yourself is what </v>

2776
02:07:51.751 --> 02:07:55.411
<v Speaker 5>you're actually doing when you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>fighting a really cool way to look at </v>

2777
02:07:55.411 --> 02:07:58.081
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the person who starts out with </v>

2778
02:07:58.081 --> 02:08:00.370
<v Speaker 5>nothing is better off than the person </v>
<v Speaker 5>who starts out with shit technique.</v>

2779
02:08:00.780 --> 02:08:05.780
<v Speaker 5>Unless the person who starts out with </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit technique is super open minded and </v>

2780
02:08:06.250 --> 02:08:11.250
<v Speaker 5>has no ego and is willing or is it very </v>
<v Speaker 5>good control of the ego and is willing </v>

2781
02:08:11.250 --> 02:08:14.590
<v Speaker 5>to try to completely learn everything </v>
<v Speaker 5>from scratch and not go into it saying,</v>

2782
02:08:14.591 --> 02:08:15.520
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm already blackballed.</v>

2783
02:08:15.580 --> 02:08:16.820
<v Speaker 5>Already know my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2784
02:08:16.900 --> 02:08:17.980
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most people do.</v>

2785
02:08:18.090 --> 02:08:18.780
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

2786
02:08:19.050 --> 02:08:24.050
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it applies across the board to </v>

2787
02:08:24.050 --> 02:08:24.050
<v Speaker 2>be quite honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know I,</v>

2788
02:08:24.050 --> 02:08:28.361
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started working with a couple of </v>

2789
02:08:28.361 --> 02:08:28.361
<v Speaker 2>people in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my,</v>

2790
02:08:28.361 --> 02:08:28.361
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for my channel.</v>

2791
02:08:28.361 --> 02:08:32.840
<v Speaker 2>I have an editor now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a guy who I've known for a long </v>

2792
02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:36.411
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't have a background in </v>

2793
02:08:36.411 --> 02:08:38.031
<v Speaker 2>editing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't have any kind of preconceived </v>

2794
02:08:38.031 --> 02:08:38.031
<v Speaker 2>notions of what these videos should look</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2795
02:08:38.031 --> 02:08:39.730
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I liked that when,</v>

2796
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:41.370
<v Speaker 2>when he came in because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2797
02:08:41.371 --> 02:08:46.371
<v Speaker 2>I can kind of finesse this idea of how I</v>
<v Speaker 2>want things to look and how I want them </v>

2798
02:08:46.371 --> 02:08:50.280
<v Speaker 2>to be and he can kind of learn starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this,</v>

2799
02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:52.290
<v Speaker 2>these parameters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that,</v>

2800
02:08:52.350 --> 02:08:57.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to somebody coming in who </v>

2801
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.350
<v Speaker 2>would have been like a professional in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this space.</v>

2802
02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:58.330
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2803
02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:02.700
<v Speaker 2>that particular perspective is something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a lot of startups are doing as well</v>

2804
02:09:02.701 --> 02:09:04.860
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to hiring new people is </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2805
02:09:05.190 --> 02:09:10.190
<v Speaker 2>are you hiring a person and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>skillset or are you hiring a </v>

2806
02:09:10.190 --> 02:09:11.430
<v Speaker 2>personality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you hiring potential?</v>

2807
02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:13.890
<v Speaker 2>And what is the difference in each of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those decisions?</v>

2808
02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you hire a professional,</v>

2809
02:09:15.631 --> 02:09:20.631
<v Speaker 2>it probably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna be able to snap your </v>

2810
02:09:20.631 --> 02:09:20.631
<v Speaker 2>fingers and be and be achieving things </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

2811
02:09:20.910 --> 02:09:25.910
<v Speaker 2>But in the end is that person that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of flexing and floating along </v>

2812
02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:27.390
<v Speaker 2>with the needs of that business over </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2813
02:09:27.850 --> 02:09:30.760
<v Speaker 5>That's good point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And also do they come into that business</v>

2814
02:09:30.761 --> 02:09:33.580
<v Speaker 5>with a preconceived notion of what their</v>
<v Speaker 5>future is going to be based on,</v>

2815
02:09:33.581 --> 02:09:38.581
<v Speaker 5>like I'm going to move from here to </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and then I'll get a corner office </v>

2816
02:09:38.581 --> 02:09:42.211
<v Speaker 5>and then blah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they have this idea already mapped </v>

2817
02:09:42.211 --> 02:09:42.220
<v Speaker 5>out in front of them and then when </v>
<v Speaker 5>things aren't that way,</v>

2818
02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:45.670
<v Speaker 5>they may be disappointed or don't know </v>
<v Speaker 5>how to react.</v>

2819
02:09:45.790 --> 02:09:50.790
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the equivalent of the bicycle </v>

2820
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:50.790
<v Speaker 5>pathway thing</v>

2821
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:51.400
<v Speaker 2>mapped out in like a different scenario </v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

2822
02:09:51.401 --> 02:09:54.180
<v Speaker 2>But it gets me thinking about myself too</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

2823
02:09:54.260 --> 02:09:54.760
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2824
02:09:54.850 --> 02:09:58.450
<v Speaker 2>in what are my pathways that I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>break in.</v>

2825
02:09:58.451 --> 02:10:03.451
<v Speaker 2>Went in thinking about subject matter in</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at the way I behave because I </v>

2826
02:10:03.451 --> 02:10:08.041
<v Speaker 2>feel like I feel like the not being able</v>
<v Speaker 2>to ride the bike the other way is the </v>

2827
02:10:08.041 --> 02:10:11.200
<v Speaker 2>perfect example of how we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we treat a lot of things like our.</v>

2828
02:10:11.201 --> 02:10:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I think our perspective should always be</v>
<v Speaker 2>floating.</v>

2829
02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:16.300
<v Speaker 2>We should always be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2830
02:10:16.301 --> 02:10:17.950
<v Speaker 2>in politics and stuff they're always </v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

2831
02:10:17.951 --> 02:10:19.810
<v Speaker 2>but that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he flipped flopped.</v>

2832
02:10:19.811 --> 02:10:21.270
<v Speaker 2>He used to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he says yes.</v>

2833
02:10:21.271 --> 02:10:21.310
<v Speaker 2>Says,</v>

2834
02:10:21.330 --> 02:10:22.370
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't that normal?</v>

2835
02:10:22.371 --> 02:10:27.371
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that life will flip flopping and </v>
<v Speaker 5>politics is hilarious because it's the </v>

2836
02:10:27.651 --> 02:10:31.820
<v Speaker 5>one part of life where you're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 5>to have a preformed decision by the time</v>

2837
02:10:31.821 --> 02:10:34.480
<v Speaker 5>you enter into public office and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>never changes.</v>

2838
02:10:34.760 --> 02:10:37.760
<v Speaker 5>Like you can't evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird as a society</v>

2839
02:10:37.850 --> 02:10:42.850
<v Speaker 2>seems that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we value for some reason a person who </v>

2840
02:10:42.850 --> 02:10:44.540
<v Speaker 2>doesn't change their opinion when in </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality it should be the other thing.</v>

2841
02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:48.190
<v Speaker 5>Well also some of these opinions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not like murder is bad,</v>

2842
02:10:48.670 --> 02:10:53.670
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there are complex issues that </v>

2843
02:10:53.670 --> 02:10:53.670
<v Speaker 5>were under a lot of consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

2844
02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:59.040
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean especially when it comes to </v>

2845
02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:00.391
<v Speaker 5>things about maybe the economy or things</v>
<v Speaker 5>about what should and shouldn't be a </v>

2846
02:11:00.391 --> 02:11:01.800
<v Speaker 5>crime and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what,</v>

2847
02:11:02.090 --> 02:11:07.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it actually a crime to make people </v>

2848
02:11:07.090 --> 02:11:10.740
<v Speaker 5>prisoners?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that more of a crime then then </v>

2849
02:11:10.740 --> 02:11:10.990
<v Speaker 5>selling drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like what is the crime here?</v>

2850
02:11:11.080 --> 02:11:16.080
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be dynamic and it always has </v>

2851
02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:16.080
<v Speaker 2>been dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing,</v>

2852
02:11:16.080 --> 02:11:17.710
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what it is exactly that</v>
<v Speaker 2>holds it back.</v>

2853
02:11:17.711 --> 02:11:22.711
<v Speaker 2>I also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a fine line because on the </v>

2854
02:11:22.711 --> 02:11:25.260
<v Speaker 2>other side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a person's bouncing around from day </v>

2855
02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:25.590
<v Speaker 2>to day on how they feel about something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be a fucking nightmare as well.</v>

2856
02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Well then they shouldn't be a leader </v>
<v Speaker 2>mean that sort of even need in your </v>

2857
02:11:30.620 --> 02:11:30.620
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a relationship.</v>

2858
02:11:31.150 --> 02:11:36.150
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's like there's this really </v>
<v Speaker 2>this groove somewhere in the middle of </v>

2859
02:11:36.150 --> 02:11:38.230
<v Speaker 2>like committing to certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but being open minded about others.</v>

2860
02:11:38.231 --> 02:11:39.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like kind of a balance to it.</v>

2861
02:11:40.070 --> 02:11:42.170
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that the case with pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything in life,</v>

2862
02:11:42.171 --> 02:11:47.171
<v Speaker 5>that life really doesn't have a whole </v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of real solid black and whites that </v>

2863
02:11:47.171 --> 02:11:49.860
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of room for consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of.</v>

2864
02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:53.270
<v Speaker 5>A lot of variables that you're managing </v>
<v Speaker 5>on a daily basis.</v>

2865
02:11:53.420 --> 02:11:55.250
<v Speaker 5>Definitely comes to many things in life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Definitely,</v>

2866
02:11:55.330 --> 02:11:57.890
<v Speaker 5>and that's why a lot of things when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>look at them to go,</v>

2867
02:11:57.891 --> 02:11:58.460
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2868
02:11:58.461 --> 02:12:03.461
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well there's a lot of ways to look at </v>

2869
02:12:03.461 --> 02:12:05.081
<v Speaker 5>this and when someone wants to come at </v>
<v Speaker 5>it from a real hard black or white </v>

2870
02:12:05.081 --> 02:12:06.570
<v Speaker 5>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that usually is either someone with a,</v>

2871
02:12:06.571 --> 02:12:11.571
<v Speaker 5>like a deep agenda or someone who </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't have a considered nuance </v>

2872
02:12:12.141 --> 02:12:14.300
<v Speaker 5>perspective of the subject of hayes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of them</v>

2873
02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:19.340
<v Speaker 2>most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most frustrating things </v>

2874
02:12:19.340 --> 02:12:20.810
<v Speaker 2>about like living a substantial part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my life on the internet is that,</v>

2875
02:12:21.570 --> 02:12:23.750
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know if we talked about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>previously or not,</v>

2876
02:12:23.751 --> 02:12:28.751
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this idea of everybody having kind </v>

2877
02:12:28.751 --> 02:12:28.751
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2878
02:12:28.751 --> 02:12:32.500
<v Speaker 2>a microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody being able to blast out there.</v>

2879
02:12:32.790 --> 02:12:34.670
<v Speaker 2>They're kind of a perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2880
02:12:35.500 --> 02:12:40.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't like the comments section on </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube and my comments are not that </v>

2881
02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:40.520
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

2882
02:12:40.521 --> 02:12:44.160
<v Speaker 2>But I don't like the way it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that you could,</v>

2883
02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:47.720
<v Speaker 2>you could create this video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put all this effort into it,</v>

2884
02:12:48.230 --> 02:12:53.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>formulate a perspective and then </v>

2885
02:12:53.230 --> 02:12:55.820
<v Speaker 2>everybody's going to scroll to the top </v>
<v Speaker 2>comment and this dude put in what,</v>

2886
02:12:56.300 --> 02:13:00.380
<v Speaker 2>10 seconds a knee jerk reaction and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets to occupied at real estate.</v>

2887
02:13:01.130 --> 02:13:03.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a better way to do that.</v>

2888
02:13:03.650 --> 02:13:08.650
<v Speaker 2>What is the better way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the person who published the </v>

2889
02:13:09.621 --> 02:13:14.621
<v Speaker 2>thing has to have a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>control over kind of like in a forum </v>

2890
02:13:14.621 --> 02:13:19.600
<v Speaker 2>traditionally how you could have </v>
<v Speaker 2>moderators who had certain abilities </v>

2891
02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:23.470
<v Speaker 2>that others didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to promote people in </v>

2892
02:13:23.470 --> 02:13:23.960
<v Speaker 2>your community to be kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority figures,</v>

2893
02:13:24.290 --> 02:13:26.480
<v Speaker 2>just like everything else you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>manage in life when it comes to.</v>

2894
02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:28.690
<v Speaker 5>But doesn't that censorship?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And a lot of ways.</v>

2895
02:13:28.691 --> 02:13:29.550
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2896
02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:31.060
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it seems to have the </v>
<v Speaker 5>option.</v>

2897
02:13:31.140 --> 02:13:32.130
<v Speaker 5>Have not have comments.</v>

2898
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's not,</v>

2899
02:13:33.210 --> 02:13:34.860
<v Speaker 2>that's not a good look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good look.</v>

2900
02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:39.150
<v Speaker 2>You have comments turned off if you're a</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist.</v>

2901
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:44.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I come to your video and you </v>

2902
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.510
<v Speaker 2>have comments turned off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2903
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.510
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

2904
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:46.440
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're probably talking bullshit because</v>

2905
02:13:46.441 --> 02:13:49.500
<v Speaker 2>you're not even willing to have the to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have anybody saying anything here.</v>

2906
02:13:49.530 --> 02:13:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can say it.</v>

2907
02:13:50.281 --> 02:13:52.380
<v Speaker 2>They just cannot say right underneath </v>
<v Speaker 2>your work.</v>

2908
02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:53.460
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2909
02:13:54.900 --> 02:13:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I wish I'm thinking it would be cool </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if it was that way it would be cool</v>

2910
02:13:58.230 --> 02:14:03.230
<v Speaker 2>and trust me whenever I engage in </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything slightly more artistic or </v>

2911
02:14:03.230 --> 02:14:04.290
<v Speaker 2>subjective online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2912
02:14:04.380 --> 02:14:05.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2913
02:14:05.251 --> 02:14:10.251
<v Speaker 2>it'd be cool to turn off the comments </v>
<v Speaker 2>and let it just let it breathe a little </v>

2914
02:14:10.251 --> 02:14:10.800
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time I'm like,</v>

2915
02:14:10.801 --> 02:14:15.440
<v Speaker 2>this is the format that has been what </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's accepted and and,</v>

2916
02:14:15.441 --> 02:14:17.280
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and expects now.</v>

2917
02:14:17.490 --> 02:14:22.490
<v Speaker 2>And so I feel like probably the </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthier approach is this idea of </v>

2918
02:14:22.490 --> 02:14:26.181
<v Speaker 2>tweaking it and what are the numbers </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what percentage of people actually </v>

2919
02:14:27.340 --> 02:14:32.160
<v Speaker 2>comment fucking dominate the goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

2920
02:14:32.250 --> 02:14:37.250
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the ones with the shittiest points </v>

2921
02:14:37.250 --> 02:14:37.250
<v Speaker 2>of view are the ones that are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>loudest,</v>

2922
02:14:37.250 --> 02:14:39.240
<v Speaker 2>loudest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most black and white.</v>

2923
02:14:39.270 --> 02:14:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Just like the headline science we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about before.</v>

2924
02:14:42.010 --> 02:14:47.010
<v Speaker 2>There's a reaction that you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>really negative aggressively shitty </v>

2925
02:14:47.010 --> 02:14:47.010
<v Speaker 2>comment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2926
02:14:47.010 --> 02:14:51.620
<v Speaker 2>or I'm going to reply to that and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>now there's a whole thread underneath of</v>

2927
02:14:51.621 --> 02:14:56.621
<v Speaker 2>that guy single comment which then </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushes it to the top because it's </v>

2928
02:14:56.621 --> 02:14:58.590
<v Speaker 2>creating conversation and this is stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>that like on the highest level,</v>

2929
02:14:58.740 --> 02:15:01.470
<v Speaker 2>the biggest businesses in the space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're google,</v>

2930
02:15:01.471 --> 02:15:05.040
<v Speaker 2>if you're facebook or they're having </v>
<v Speaker 2>board room meetings about this stuff,</v>

2931
02:15:05.130 --> 02:15:10.130
<v Speaker 2>you hear about what clinton's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know hillary clinton is spending </v>

2932
02:15:10.130 --> 02:15:13.191
<v Speaker 2>$1,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>to combat forum trolls and people on </v>

2933
02:15:13.561 --> 02:15:16.590
<v Speaker 2>reddit and twitter and social media.</v>

2934
02:15:16.650 --> 02:15:18.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What with her own mercenaries,</v>

2935
02:15:18.571 --> 02:15:23.571
<v Speaker 2>who was going to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a hundred people that are </v>

2936
02:15:23.571 --> 02:15:26.301
<v Speaker 2>working for her that actively go out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct people that are saying negative </v>

2937
02:15:27.991 --> 02:15:32.991
<v Speaker 2>things about this fucking career </v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal and might be the president </v>

2938
02:15:32.991 --> 02:15:33.360
<v Speaker 2>United States day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like that either.</v>

2939
02:15:33.590 --> 02:15:37.170
<v Speaker 2>You know when I'm talking about maybe </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweaking the comment system.</v>

2940
02:15:37.171 --> 02:15:39.470
<v Speaker 2>Hell no to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look at this like,</v>

2941
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:42.840
<v Speaker 2>do you have a junior?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is bizarre.</v>

2942
02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:43.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's creepy,</v>

2943
02:15:43.611 --> 02:15:48.611
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the first time anyone has ever </v>

2944
02:15:48.611 --> 02:15:49.881
<v Speaker 2>done this before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Done it opened the way that politicians </v>

2945
02:15:49.881 --> 02:15:53.300
<v Speaker 2>have been able to use social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paying online trolls to attack anyone </v>

2946
02:15:53.300 --> 02:15:54.350
<v Speaker 2>disparages her pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who?</v>

2947
02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Who's the guy who wrote that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that the guy that twitter guy who.</v>

2948
02:15:58.680 --> 02:15:59.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

2949
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:04.620
<v Speaker 2>We're complaint is the white guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That does be black.</v>

2950
02:16:05.010 --> 02:16:07.170
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It definitely is.</v>

2951
02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't fallen it.</v>

2952
02:16:08.650 --> 02:16:11.370
<v Speaker 2>If you'd follow it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no evidence whatsoever.</v>

2953
02:16:11.371 --> 02:16:13.290
<v Speaker 2>There's any african american in him at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

2954
02:16:13.291 --> 02:16:15.600
<v Speaker 2>You'll get his brothers and his sister.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all look like him.</v>

2955
02:16:15.601 --> 02:16:17.730
<v Speaker 2>His dad's white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing's a mess.</v>

2956
02:16:17.731 --> 02:16:19.740
<v Speaker 2>His mom's white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2957
02:16:19.830 --> 02:16:23.790
<v Speaker 2>Don't ever pull up this guy's articles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of other articles on it.</v>

2958
02:16:24.420 --> 02:16:26.160
<v Speaker 2>That guy's a fucking fraud.</v>

2959
02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:33.500
<v Speaker 2>It's weird that that guys employed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's employed by like the daily news or </v>

2960
02:16:33.500 --> 02:16:35.050
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus christ like.</v>

2961
02:16:35.230 --> 02:16:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Do you guys have google?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you doing daily news?</v>

2962
02:16:39.220 --> 02:16:42.000
<v Speaker 2>It's probably because you can promote </v>
<v Speaker 2>the article and tweeted out.</v>

2963
02:16:42.020 --> 02:16:47.020
<v Speaker 2>I assume he has a following I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a lot of that going on that </v>

2964
02:16:47.020 --> 02:16:50.350
<v Speaker 2>that is a lot of what's happening with </v>
<v Speaker 2>with these newspapers too.</v>

2965
02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:55.380
<v Speaker 2>They've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've sort of fallen into a state </v>

2966
02:16:55.380 --> 02:16:56.650
<v Speaker 2>realm to have to survive on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember when they used to try to</v>

2967
02:16:56.890 --> 02:16:58.720
<v Speaker 2>make you pay to subscribe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2968
02:16:58.721 --> 02:17:00.220
<v Speaker 2>some do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New york times is still pay.</v>

2969
02:17:00.221 --> 02:17:05.221
<v Speaker 2>Well you can still do that and articles </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you had to pay to continue </v>

2970
02:17:05.221 --> 02:17:09.541
<v Speaker 2>beyond news papers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean those institutions and the most </v>

2971
02:17:09.541 --> 02:17:12.130
<v Speaker 2>entitled group of people that still </v>
<v Speaker 2>exists.</v>

2972
02:17:12.131 --> 02:17:17.131
<v Speaker 2>Then maybe radio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait to be honest for every car </v>

2973
02:17:17.131 --> 02:17:18.930
<v Speaker 2>on the planet to ship with android auto </v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

2974
02:17:19.010 --> 02:17:23.380
<v Speaker 2>or apple car play because then it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrap android art.</v>

2975
02:17:23.630 --> 02:17:28.210
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is like I've seen a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of cars that have google car play.</v>

2976
02:17:28.211 --> 02:17:29.530
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had one of my cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2977
02:17:29.531 --> 02:17:30.460
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't,</v>

2978
02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:33.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't recall ever seeing a car with </v>
<v Speaker 2>android auto,</v>

2979
02:17:33.460 --> 02:17:38.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's an android.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least 50 percent of the smartphone </v>

2980
02:17:38.460 --> 02:17:38.460
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2981
02:17:38.460 --> 02:17:39.420
<v Speaker 2>Probably more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2982
02:17:39.550 --> 02:17:41.710
<v Speaker 2>maybe not in the us globally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more than 50.</v>

2983
02:17:41.860 --> 02:17:46.860
<v Speaker 2>More than 50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it because in emerging markets </v>

2984
02:17:46.860 --> 02:17:47.880
<v Speaker 2>nobody can afford iphones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2985
02:17:48.350 --> 02:17:49.840
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could tell me this,</v>

2986
02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:53.890
<v Speaker 2>like the latest samsung,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the galaxy s seven.</v>

2987
02:17:53.891 --> 02:17:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically a wrap right there,</v>

2988
02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:59.260
<v Speaker 2>a wash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got pros and cons,</v>

2989
02:17:59.261 --> 02:18:01.570
<v Speaker 2>but they're both pretty goddamn camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2990
02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>

2991
02:18:02.531 --> 02:18:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have a problem recommending.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2992
02:18:05.720 --> 02:18:09.610
<v Speaker 2>An s seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any of the nexus devices?</v>

2993
02:18:10.020 --> 02:18:11.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else?</v>

2994
02:18:11.501 --> 02:18:16.501
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that I didn't really like that </v>

2995
02:18:16.501 --> 02:18:16.501
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't made a video about it.</v>

2996
02:18:16.501 --> 02:18:20.850
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the problem with me is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes if I'm not into something I </v>

2997
02:18:20.850 --> 02:18:21.030
<v Speaker 2>just don't make a video about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people are like,</v>

2998
02:18:21.040 --> 02:18:23.140
<v Speaker 2>well I just got what you so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>excited about everything.</v>

2999
02:18:23.141 --> 02:18:24.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well shit,</v>

3000
02:18:24.011 --> 02:18:29.011
<v Speaker 2>I want to make video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that stuff I'm excited about trying </v>

3001
02:18:29.011 --> 02:18:29.011
<v Speaker 2>to be positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3002
02:18:29.011 --> 02:18:30.190
<v Speaker 2>Like I understand how that can look </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3003
02:18:30.191 --> 02:18:31.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just always taking,</v>

3004
02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:36.840
<v Speaker 2>you're not taking a strong position,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like if I put my sim card into </v>

3005
02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:38.830
<v Speaker 2>a phone and I'm not feeling it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to last very long,</v>

3006
02:18:39.150 --> 02:18:40.330
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

3007
02:18:40.510 --> 02:18:42.640
<v Speaker 2>I had some issues with lgs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Latest phone,</v>

3008
02:18:42.641 --> 02:18:47.440
<v Speaker 2>even though I like some stuff about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>that [inaudible] it's a modular phone so</v>

3009
02:18:47.441 --> 02:18:48.880
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you remember,</v>

3010
02:18:48.881 --> 02:18:53.881
<v Speaker 2>there was this thing called project aria</v>
<v Speaker 2>project or a project I remember it was a</v>

3011
02:18:54.890 --> 02:18:55.880
<v Speaker 2>modular could like.</v>

3012
02:18:56.330 --> 02:18:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>That obviously never happened,</v>

3013
02:18:58.151 --> 02:19:02.110
<v Speaker 2>but lg kind of a took,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took the approach of like trying to make</v>

3014
02:19:02.111 --> 02:19:03.820
<v Speaker 2>what the consumer version of that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>look like.</v>

3015
02:19:03.821 --> 02:19:08.821
<v Speaker 2>So tHere's modules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the battery compartment you can pull </v>

3016
02:19:08.821 --> 02:19:12.571
<v Speaker 2>out the battery and then re insert like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a camera module which is going to give </v>

3017
02:19:12.571 --> 02:19:14.890
<v Speaker 2>you a better grip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different attributes to the camera.</v>

3018
02:19:15.590 --> 02:19:19.260
<v Speaker 2>You can pull this fucking thing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pull that out and you could put,</v>

3019
02:19:19.370 --> 02:19:24.370
<v Speaker 2>put in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put in another module which is a better </v>

3020
02:19:24.370 --> 02:19:26.140
<v Speaker 2>headphone amplifier so you can run </v>
<v Speaker 2>better headphones off of your phone.</v>

3021
02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:27.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

3022
02:19:27.650 --> 02:19:30.560
<v Speaker 2>And I like that kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turns me on.</v>

3023
02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:33.200
<v Speaker 2>I liked that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I see it I'm like fuck,</v>

3024
02:19:33.201 --> 02:19:36.320
<v Speaker 2>I want to support that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's not 100 percent polished.</v>

3025
02:19:36.910 --> 02:19:37.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here we go.</v>

3026
02:19:37.941 --> 02:19:38.820
<v Speaker 2>If you scroll down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>

3027
02:19:38.821 --> 02:19:43.821
<v Speaker 2>you'll see if you can see how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>battery pulled out on the bottom and </v>

3028
02:19:43.821 --> 02:19:46.751
<v Speaker 2>that picture there so that they call </v>
<v Speaker 2>them friends as a bit of an issue with </v>

3029
02:19:46.751 --> 02:19:47.300
<v Speaker 2>translation there.</v>

3030
02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:48.680
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3031
02:19:48.681 --> 02:19:52.520
<v Speaker 2>the different modules are called friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'll see here he can slide it out.</v>

3032
02:19:52.610 --> 02:19:56.210
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully he does in this clip here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there so that pops out.</v>

3033
02:19:56.990 --> 02:19:59.330
<v Speaker 2>And you could even just carry around </v>
<v Speaker 2>another battery,</v>

3034
02:19:59.390 --> 02:20:02.510
<v Speaker 2>which that's becoming a tougher thing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with phones.</v>

3035
02:20:02.511 --> 02:20:05.830
<v Speaker 2>Obviously you're getting killed here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking hit.</v>

3036
02:20:06.860 --> 02:20:09.320
<v Speaker 2>I'll look at the options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to save.</v>

3037
02:20:09.710 --> 02:20:11.390
<v Speaker 2>I want to be a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I click on,</v>

3038
02:20:11.391 --> 02:20:13.560
<v Speaker 2>I want to be able to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3039
02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:14.690
<v Speaker 2>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3040
02:20:14.691 --> 02:20:19.691
<v Speaker 2>I hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they show any of the </v>

3041
02:20:19.691 --> 02:20:20.981
<v Speaker 2>other modules here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're opening it up to third </v>

3042
02:20:20.981 --> 02:20:23.081
<v Speaker 2>parties as a port.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So essentially if you're a in audio </v>

3043
02:20:23.081 --> 02:20:24.730
<v Speaker 2>maker and you want to have your own amp </v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

3044
02:20:24.780 --> 02:20:28.790
<v Speaker 2>or if you're a god knows what accessory </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might want to have utilized,</v>

3045
02:20:28.791 --> 02:20:30.440
<v Speaker 2>that may be a bigger battery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3046
02:20:30.441 --> 02:20:32.490
<v Speaker 2>maybe uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3047
02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:33.650
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

3048
02:20:33.651 --> 02:20:38.651
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is that you might want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>improve that you could access that and </v>

3049
02:20:38.651 --> 02:20:38.651
<v Speaker 2>do so what an uphill battle it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

3050
02:20:38.651 --> 02:20:41.600
<v Speaker 2>for these cell phone companies to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with something that you can get other</v>

3051
02:20:41.601 --> 02:20:46.601
<v Speaker 2>people to jump in on and make </v>
<v Speaker 2>accessories for because people look at </v>

3052
02:20:46.601 --> 02:20:46.601
<v Speaker 2>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3053
02:20:46.601 --> 02:20:46.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if this is going to catch </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

3054
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:52.030
<v Speaker 2>do we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we use our resources and our </v>

3055
02:20:52.030 --> 02:20:52.030
<v Speaker 2>engineers to develop something.</v>

3056
02:20:52.030 --> 02:20:54.380
<v Speaker 2>This is Lg platform when we can just </v>
<v Speaker 2>make some shit for the iphone.</v>

3057
02:20:54.381 --> 02:20:55.840
<v Speaker 2>And it's gonna sell for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

3058
02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:01.000
<v Speaker 2>And this is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why there's such a huge </v>

3059
02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:01.100
<v Speaker 2>abundance of accessories for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform.</v>

3060
02:21:01.101 --> 02:21:03.200
<v Speaker 2>And it's something to consider for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

3061
02:21:03.350 --> 02:21:05.100
<v Speaker 2>There's some of the modules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

3062
02:21:05.101 --> 02:21:10.101
<v Speaker 2>The module and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that brown one is that the camera one </v>

3063
02:21:10.101 --> 02:21:10.970
<v Speaker 2>that what the fuck wouldn't grip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get a real shutter,</v>

3064
02:21:10.971 --> 02:21:15.971
<v Speaker 2>like a regular camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that upper left one that was </v>

3065
02:21:15.971 --> 02:21:16.940
<v Speaker 2>like a speaker that's actually lgs </v>
<v Speaker 2>camera one.</v>

3066
02:21:17.130 --> 02:21:22.130
<v Speaker 2>so that's a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So basically what it does is it gives </v>

3067
02:21:22.130 --> 02:21:25.481
<v Speaker 2>you a bigger battery first of all and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then it gives you some control over the </v>

3068
02:21:25.481 --> 02:21:29.861
<v Speaker 2>shutter as well as a wheel now under </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional camera that we'll normally </v>

3069
02:21:29.861 --> 02:21:34.691
<v Speaker 2>it would be mapped to like shutter speed</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something more professional style of </v>

3070
02:21:34.851 --> 02:21:35.540
<v Speaker 2>interaction.</v>

3071
02:21:35.570 --> 02:21:40.570
<v Speaker 2>So it wouldn't just be clicking go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get more control over the </v>

3072
02:21:40.570 --> 02:21:41.150
<v Speaker 2>manual functions of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3073
02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:46.160
<v Speaker 2>that went in the middle I think is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a digital analog converter.</v>

3074
02:21:46.251 --> 02:21:51.251
<v Speaker 2>So headphone amp from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's bang and olufsen some high </v>

3075
02:21:51.251 --> 02:21:52.220
<v Speaker 2>end audio company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can drive bigger headphones.</v>

3076
02:21:52.221 --> 02:21:53.990
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really liked the approach.</v>

3077
02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:59.000
<v Speaker 2>Another thing they did on that phone is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they put two lenses on the back and a </v>

3078
02:21:59.000 --> 02:21:59.930
<v Speaker 2>lot of people think on the next iphone </v>
<v Speaker 2>we might see two lenses as well.</v>

3079
02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Among I'll ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask you this before I get into this</v>

3080
02:22:03.681 --> 02:22:05.030
<v Speaker 2>next part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did actually know what,</v>

3081
02:22:05.031 --> 02:22:08.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get to that in a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go do dual lens,</v>

3082
02:22:09.050 --> 02:22:10.820
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dual lens on the,</v>

3083
02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:16.240
<v Speaker 2>on the lg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them is super wide angle so you </v>

3084
02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:16.240
<v Speaker 2>can capture a really wide frame.</v>

3085
02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:20.650
<v Speaker 2>This is one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of my pet peeves about a </v>

3086
02:22:20.650 --> 02:22:21.710
<v Speaker 2>phone cameras and you can see both of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them there if they're not very wide.</v>

3087
02:22:21.950 --> 02:22:25.920
<v Speaker 2>So like you want to capture like a group</v>
<v Speaker 2>or architecture or beach or something.</v>

3088
02:22:25.921 --> 02:22:28.170
<v Speaker 2>It's always like this really narrow </v>
<v Speaker 2>field of view.</v>

3089
02:22:28.680 --> 02:22:33.680
<v Speaker 2>So in this particular case one of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>is super wide and one of them is a more </v>

3090
02:22:33.680 --> 02:22:35.850
<v Speaker 2>standard field of view and so it's like </v>
<v Speaker 2>having an interchangeable lens system,</v>

3091
02:22:35.851 --> 02:22:40.851
<v Speaker 2>but it's always in your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right from within the app you can </v>

3092
02:22:40.851 --> 02:22:40.920
<v Speaker 2>switch between lenses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

3093
02:22:40.950 --> 02:22:41.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

3094
02:22:41.730 --> 02:22:43.740
<v Speaker 2>So the iphone might do something </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar.</v>

3095
02:22:43.741 --> 02:22:46.140
<v Speaker 2>What do you not like about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3096
02:22:46.380 --> 02:22:50.100
<v Speaker 2>So what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how fair it is,</v>

3097
02:22:50.101 --> 02:22:55.101
<v Speaker 2>but really the way I evaluate a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's how it kind of interacts with all </v>

3098
02:22:55.101 --> 02:22:56.790
<v Speaker 2>the other devices that I expected to </v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with,</v>

3099
02:22:56.791 --> 02:23:00.060
<v Speaker 2>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I get in my truck and I wanted,</v>

3100
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:03.000
<v Speaker 2>I want this shit to seamlessly connect </v>
<v Speaker 2>via bluetooth,</v>

3101
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:05.280
<v Speaker 2>start playing my podcast and so on.</v>

3102
02:23:05.790 --> 02:23:07.560
<v Speaker 2>ThIs phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

3103
02:23:07.620 --> 02:23:12.620
<v Speaker 2>it had no problem linking up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>multimedia portion to play the music,</v>

3104
02:23:13.790 --> 02:23:17.070
<v Speaker 2>the podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the headset portion and for whatever</v>

3105
02:23:17.071 --> 02:23:20.280
<v Speaker 2>reason it wouldn't connect for answering</v>
<v Speaker 2>phone calls via my bluetooth.</v>

3106
02:23:20.640 --> 02:23:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is anecdotal,</v>

3107
02:23:21.961 --> 02:23:23.820
<v Speaker 2>this is my personal experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't.</v>

3108
02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:26.760
<v Speaker 2>It's tough to even put that out there </v>
<v Speaker 2>because who knows?</v>

3109
02:23:26.761 --> 02:23:29.220
<v Speaker 2>It's just the way that's talking to my </v>
<v Speaker 2>my truck,</v>

3110
02:23:29.790 --> 02:23:33.150
<v Speaker 2>but that that issue doesn't exist with </v>
<v Speaker 2>any of the other flagships,</v>

3111
02:23:33.151 --> 02:23:35.010
<v Speaker 2>so that's something that I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider.</v>

3112
02:23:35.630 --> 02:23:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Another thing is build,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of people were upset because of</v>

3113
02:23:38.581 --> 02:23:40.830
<v Speaker 2>the way that that modular portion fits </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

3114
02:23:40.860 --> 02:23:44.010
<v Speaker 2>It's not completelY flush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit rough around the edges</v>

3115
02:23:44.610 --> 02:23:47.940
<v Speaker 2>and so again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so competitive in this marketplace.</v>

3116
02:23:48.090 --> 02:23:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Any lIttle inch you're going to give up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to have a drastic impact.</v>

3117
02:23:52.141 --> 02:23:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Then lastly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like their software,</v>

3118
02:23:54.181 --> 02:23:57.030
<v Speaker 2>their skin that they put on android,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we talked about this before.</v>

3119
02:23:57.030 --> 02:24:00.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm a purist when it comes to that and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually modify that anyways,</v>

3120
02:24:00.661 --> 02:24:04.770
<v Speaker 2>but there was some weirdness from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>get go about not just the skin they have</v>

3121
02:24:04.771 --> 02:24:09.771
<v Speaker 2>on there but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how hard it is to really switch it </v>

3122
02:24:09.771 --> 02:24:11.910
<v Speaker 2>around too much to the samsung theme </v>
<v Speaker 2>store is a little bit more elaborate.</v>

3123
02:24:11.970 --> 02:24:16.970
<v Speaker 2>If you want to change the appearance of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way your touchwiz touch with has </v>

3124
02:24:16.970 --> 02:24:20.031
<v Speaker 2>gotten a lot better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still have a nexis in my pocket </v>

3125
02:24:20.031 --> 02:24:20.031
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now the nexus phones,</v>

3126
02:24:20.031 --> 02:24:22.440
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the service aluminate this.</v>

3127
02:24:22.450 --> 02:24:27.450
<v Speaker 2>There's something where with google you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can pay google and that becomes your </v>

3128
02:24:28.681 --> 02:24:33.681
<v Speaker 2>provider and you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your phone will work on everything t </v>

3129
02:24:33.681 --> 02:24:34.350
<v Speaker 2>mobile not as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not everything?</v>

3130
02:24:34.351 --> 02:24:35.630
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

3131
02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:37.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3132
02:24:37.050 --> 02:24:42.050
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just a select carriers </v>

3133
02:24:42.050 --> 02:24:42.990
<v Speaker 2>because I don't think the verizon bands </v>
<v Speaker 2>are different or their cdma.</v>

3134
02:24:43.410 --> 02:24:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3135
02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:49.280
<v Speaker 2>I think the thought that cdma and gsm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like most phones will work on cdma and </v>

3136
02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:50.880
<v Speaker 2>gsm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the iphones will like if you travel</v>

3137
02:24:50.881 --> 02:24:53.260
<v Speaker 2>overseas and you're in a gsm </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

3138
02:24:53.620 --> 02:24:54.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

3139
02:24:54.430 --> 02:24:57.330
<v Speaker 2>Iphone is actually one of the few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if nexus does or not,</v>

3140
02:24:57.331 --> 02:25:00.510
<v Speaker 2>but that seems crazy that they wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It bounces around.</v>

3141
02:25:00.511 --> 02:25:03.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it might be t mobile and it can </v>
<v Speaker 2>bounce to sprint and a t and t.</v>

3142
02:25:03.810 --> 02:25:08.810
<v Speaker 2>That's cdma and gsm as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they're going back and forth </v>

3143
02:25:08.810 --> 02:25:08.810
<v Speaker 2>between two different types of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are.</v>

3144
02:25:08.880 --> 02:25:11.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm not 100 percent sure that service is</v>
<v Speaker 2>not available where I am.</v>

3145
02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

3146
02:25:12.320 --> 02:25:13.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just in Canada.</v>

3147
02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:16.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not 100 percent sure on that,</v>

3148
02:25:16.141 --> 02:25:20.190
<v Speaker 2>but with nexus devices in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do whatever you want with them.</v>

3149
02:25:20.191 --> 02:25:25.191
<v Speaker 2>They're completely unlocked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so even if you just went to the google </v>

3150
02:25:25.191 --> 02:25:26.410
<v Speaker 2>google play store and ordered a nexus </v>
<v Speaker 2>six p or five x,</v>

3151
02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:31.920
<v Speaker 2>any sim card you put in there is going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to work and nexus does it that way so </v>

3152
02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:32.890
<v Speaker 2>they can give you the pure google </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

3153
02:25:32.890 --> 02:25:35.340
<v Speaker 2>You're buying it directly from google </v>
<v Speaker 2>witHout skins?</v>

3154
02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:40.380
<v Speaker 2>No apps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no touch with no bullshit and the tough </v>

3155
02:25:40.380 --> 02:25:42.961
<v Speaker 2>part about that is there's so few people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who have ever even experienced it </v>

3156
02:25:42.961 --> 02:25:43.810
<v Speaker 2>because you can't pick it up in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>verizon store and att and t store.</v>

3157
02:25:44.350 --> 02:25:46.270
<v Speaker 2>That's got to be frustrated for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>google people.</v>

3158
02:25:46.390 --> 02:25:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

3159
02:25:48.130 --> 02:25:53.130
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time it feels like they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do more from a marketing </v>

3160
02:25:53.130 --> 02:25:53.130
<v Speaker 2>perspective to build awareness around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the brand.</v>

3161
02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:55.540
<v Speaker 2>I would definitely because um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm barely aware of it.</v>

3162
02:25:55.570 --> 02:25:58.090
<v Speaker 2>I know most people are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think part of it has to do with,</v>

3163
02:25:58.091 --> 02:25:59.590
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3164
02:25:59.700 --> 02:26:03.010
<v Speaker 2>the oil business and the highway </v>
<v Speaker 2>business and it's like you don't want to</v>

3165
02:26:03.011 --> 02:26:06.960
<v Speaker 2>piss off carriers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carrier still pull so much weight and so</v>

3166
02:26:07.010 --> 02:26:12.010
<v Speaker 2>it's weird that the carriers would want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to just all over the soup we are back </v>

3167
02:26:12.010 --> 02:26:12.040
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3168
02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3169
02:26:12.870 --> 02:26:15.100
<v Speaker 2>Now the carriers on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3170
02:26:15.101 --> 02:26:20.101
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's tons of evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>verizon and comcast and fucking,</v>

3171
02:26:21.941 --> 02:26:26.941
<v Speaker 2>you name it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all trying to protect this </v>

3172
02:26:26.941 --> 02:26:29.251
<v Speaker 2>really this really strange business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they started out as what cable </v>

3173
02:26:29.251 --> 02:26:33.511
<v Speaker 2>companies and give doing home phones and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it was like all of a sudden this </v>

3174
02:26:33.511 --> 02:26:37.961
<v Speaker 2>whole thing was mobile and we've seen t </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we could and we could bounce around </v>

3175
02:26:37.961 --> 02:26:41.611
<v Speaker 2>and we had and it's like a really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The busIness has changed but they've </v>

3176
02:26:41.611 --> 02:26:43.840
<v Speaker 2>continued to try to lock you into this </v>
<v Speaker 2>bundle,</v>

3177
02:26:44.260 --> 02:26:49.260
<v Speaker 2>the bundle of things that you could have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tv package that's $200 and you </v>

3178
02:26:49.260 --> 02:26:53.881
<v Speaker 2>watched four stations and I mean their </v>
<v Speaker 2>banking so hard that I can understand </v>

3179
02:26:54.101 --> 02:26:55.550
<v Speaker 2>why that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're trying to protect,</v>

3180
02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:59.110
<v Speaker 2>they trying to lock you in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything you buy that they going to lock</v>

3181
02:26:59.111 --> 02:27:01.180
<v Speaker 2>you into a contract and it's a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred dollars.</v>

3182
02:27:01.180 --> 02:27:03.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's pretty obvious there's a bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a play there.</v>

3183
02:27:03.730 --> 02:27:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are wising up to a lot of people.</v>

3184
02:27:06.670 --> 02:27:09.040
<v Speaker 2>A lot more people are buying their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>devices now.</v>

3185
02:27:09.130 --> 02:27:14.130
<v Speaker 2>So jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if you can figure out what exactly </v>

3186
02:27:14.130 --> 02:27:15.020
<v Speaker 2>that nexus service is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it works.</v>

3187
02:27:15.690 --> 02:27:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>google project five.</v>

3188
02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:22.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does not saying anything on here </v>

3189
02:27:22.640 --> 02:27:23.730
<v Speaker 2>specifically about which network </v>
<v Speaker 2>networks.</v>

3190
02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Click on the network button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just says that judas is the best </v>

3191
02:27:28.750 --> 02:27:28.750
<v Speaker 2>network and it goes from lte to fly back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and forth.</v>

3192
02:27:28.750 --> 02:27:32.200
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't say which carrier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're actually in an lc to wifi.</v>

3193
02:27:32.470 --> 02:27:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It bounces back on lte.</v>

3194
02:27:34.310 --> 02:27:36.100
<v Speaker 2>Lte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to wifi.</v>

3195
02:27:36.740 --> 02:27:38.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

3196
02:27:38.330 --> 02:27:43.330
<v Speaker 2>but how is it using wifi?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This two to four g lte networks to </v>

3197
02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:46.060
<v Speaker 2>networks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember who they are.</v>

3198
02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:50.000
<v Speaker 2>Phi access the best of two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four g lte network.</v>

3199
02:27:50.001 --> 02:27:53.110
<v Speaker 2>So you can connect to more towers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get fast speeds at more places.</v>

3200
02:27:53.111 --> 02:27:55.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm nearly positive that one of them is </v>
<v Speaker 2>t mobile.</v>

3201
02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:58.840
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't say on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't not say that?</v>

3202
02:27:58.841 --> 02:28:03.841
<v Speaker 2>Seems crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That might have a white paper somewhere </v>

3203
02:28:03.841 --> 02:28:03.841
<v Speaker 2>on the internet to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get your hands on.</v>

3204
02:28:03.841 --> 02:28:05.050
<v Speaker 2>But listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this connected better wifi.</v>

3205
02:28:05.051 --> 02:28:08.050
<v Speaker 2>There are lots of wifi wifi hotspots out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

3206
02:28:08.860 --> 02:28:12.520
<v Speaker 2>but not all of them are high quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Project fi automatically connects you to</v>

3207
02:28:12.521 --> 02:28:14.950
<v Speaker 2>more than a million free open wifi </v>
<v Speaker 2>spots.</v>

3208
02:28:14.951 --> 02:28:19.951
<v Speaker 2>We verified for faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that affect you while you're </v>

3209
02:28:19.951 --> 02:28:22.390
<v Speaker 2>walking around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it really going to go from why spider</v>

3210
02:28:22.410 --> 02:28:23.850
<v Speaker 3>wife?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds ridiculous.</v>

3211
02:28:23.851 --> 02:28:26.180
<v Speaker 3>They had a little graphic on here to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of just shows it,</v>

3212
02:28:26.181 --> 02:28:27.370
<v Speaker 3>but I mean it's just graphics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

3213
02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:29.780
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not real life application.</v>

3214
02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:30.090
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

3215
02:28:30.100 --> 02:28:35.100
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not giving you actual data </v>

3216
02:28:35.100 --> 02:28:35.100
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3217
02:28:35.720 --> 02:28:39.410
<v Speaker 3>Calls and text over wifi for more </v>
<v Speaker 3>coverage.</v>

3218
02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:41.330
<v Speaker 3>Seed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This sounds good in paper,</v>

3219
02:28:41.331 --> 02:28:46.331
<v Speaker 3>like maybe 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>calls transition seamlessly from wifi </v>

3220
02:28:46.331 --> 02:28:46.370
<v Speaker 3>and cell phone networks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell it to people.</v>

3221
02:28:46.510 --> 02:28:48.830
<v Speaker 3>Their phone drops off left and right and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're yelling at you.</v>

3222
02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:51.750
<v Speaker 3>I'm switching networks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going back to the mobile.</v>

3223
02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:53.330
<v Speaker 3>The movement of a nightmare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know.</v>

3224
02:28:53.331 --> 02:28:54.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

3225
02:28:54.081 --> 02:28:55.070
<v Speaker 3>this is kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

3226
02:28:55.071 --> 02:28:57.590
<v Speaker 3>this is kind of along the lines of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>modular phone.</v>

3227
02:28:57.591 --> 02:28:58.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

3228
02:28:58.670 --> 02:29:01.950
<v Speaker 3>It speaks to me in some way at least </v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea of,</v>

3229
02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:07.320
<v Speaker 3>of innovating in this space,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't necessarily mean it's </v>

3230
02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:07.320
<v Speaker 3>all the way.</v>

3231
02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:11.470
<v Speaker 3>There was jamie cv you can find instead </v>
<v Speaker 3>of this commercial cartoon,</v>

3232
02:29:11.841 --> 02:29:16.190
<v Speaker 3>they're showing us actual data of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>networks they're using and how it works.</v>

3233
02:29:16.350 --> 02:29:17.360
<v Speaker 3>Probably can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>YeaH.</v>

3234
02:29:17.390 --> 02:29:19.640
<v Speaker 3>Because chris ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dr chris ryan,</v>

3235
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:24.670
<v Speaker 3>the guy wrote sex at dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the one who first told me about </v>

3236
02:29:24.670 --> 02:29:24.670
<v Speaker 3>it and that's why he bought the phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

3237
02:29:24.670 --> 02:29:28.901
<v Speaker 3>I love it because everywhere I go he </v>
<v Speaker 3>just finds the best service and I was </v>

3238
02:29:28.901 --> 02:29:28.901
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3239
02:29:28.901 --> 02:29:31.320
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like a great idea if it's in</v>

3240
02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:33.650
<v Speaker 3>paper who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's a partner,</v>

3241
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:38.330
<v Speaker 3>sprint t mobile carriers in the us to </v>
<v Speaker 3>launch our service.</v>

3242
02:29:38.540 --> 02:29:39.590
<v Speaker 3>But you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

3243
02:29:39.620 --> 02:29:40.820
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what.</v>

3244
02:29:41.100 --> 02:29:42.540
<v Speaker 3>That's what tim does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3245
02:29:42.750 --> 02:29:44.480
<v Speaker 3>Ten years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uses sprint t mobile as well.</v>

3246
02:29:44.481 --> 02:29:48.080
<v Speaker 3>They use a t mobile for gsm and sprint </v>
<v Speaker 3>for cdma.</v>

3247
02:29:48.440 --> 02:29:52.030
<v Speaker 3>And so you would get the same coverage </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you get with t mobile or with um,</v>

3248
02:29:52.190 --> 02:29:52.760
<v Speaker 3>with ting.</v>

3249
02:29:53.060 --> 02:29:55.220
<v Speaker 3>But with ting yOu only pay for what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>use.</v>

3250
02:29:55.221 --> 02:29:57.580
<v Speaker 3>Like ting has a great deal where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3251
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:59.000
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you barely use it,</v>

3252
02:29:59.001 --> 02:30:01.580
<v Speaker 3>like I barely used my phone before and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a $10 bill.</v>

3253
02:30:01.710 --> 02:30:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3254
02:30:02.450 --> 02:30:05.720
<v Speaker 3>the one thing that they have there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that wifi transition thing.</v>

3255
02:30:06.140 --> 02:30:07.680
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're using less data.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where,</v>

3256
02:30:07.700 --> 02:30:09.980
<v Speaker 3>where you have to log into wifi </v>
<v Speaker 3>networks.</v>

3257
02:30:09.981 --> 02:30:11.990
<v Speaker 3>That's what I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How could that be verified?</v>

3258
02:30:12.020 --> 02:30:14.660
<v Speaker 3>I know and they're like reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that mean,</v>

3259
02:30:14.810 --> 02:30:19.810
<v Speaker 3>but this idea of free why spot wifi </v>
<v Speaker 3>hotspot if you go to starbucks and use </v>

3260
02:30:19.810 --> 02:30:24.581
<v Speaker 3>their hotspot or just coffee bean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to log in so you're going to </v>

3261
02:30:24.581 --> 02:30:28.840
<v Speaker 3>have to pre log in to all these places </v>
<v Speaker 3>unless they have some kind of clearance </v>

3262
02:30:28.840 --> 02:30:31.910
<v Speaker 3>maybe where those numbers could somehow </v>
<v Speaker 3>have access.</v>

3263
02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:32.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm not 100 percent sure.</v>

3264
02:30:33.250 --> 02:30:34.820
<v Speaker 3>That sounds fishy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

3265
02:30:35.030 --> 02:30:36.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm not 100 percent sure how that works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3266
02:30:36.650 --> 02:30:39.650
<v Speaker 3>but wifi calling and what night is cool </v>
<v Speaker 3>because generally speaking,</v>

3267
02:30:39.680 --> 02:30:41.900
<v Speaker 3>even in your own places like the places </v>
<v Speaker 3>you frequent,</v>

3268
02:30:41.901 --> 02:30:43.670
<v Speaker 3>like your office and your house and </v>
<v Speaker 3>such.</v>

3269
02:30:43.730 --> 02:30:46.400
<v Speaker 3>I have laughed calling on my phone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

3270
02:30:46.430 --> 02:30:47.630
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>high quality.</v>

3271
02:30:47.631 --> 02:30:52.631
<v Speaker 3>You have a great connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it does make sense in theory the way </v>

3272
02:30:52.631 --> 02:30:54.230
<v Speaker 3>they were showing it on that graphic is </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably overstating it,</v>

3273
02:30:54.430 --> 02:30:55.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3274
02:30:55.260 --> 02:30:56.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

3275
02:30:56.451 --> 02:30:57.320
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3276
02:30:57.321 --> 02:30:59.090
<v Speaker 3>so in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the android space,</v>

3277
02:30:59.091 --> 02:31:04.091
<v Speaker 3>I think it's pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think right now for me it would be </v>

3278
02:31:04.091 --> 02:31:06.200
<v Speaker 3>probably an s seven or the nexus six p </v>
<v Speaker 3>keys in my pocket,</v>

3279
02:31:06.230 --> 02:31:07.580
<v Speaker 3>which I like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I see that?</v>

3280
02:31:07.640 --> 02:31:09.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pull up this,</v>

3281
02:31:09.790 --> 02:31:11.240
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this again,</v>

3282
02:31:11.350 --> 02:31:16.350
<v Speaker 3>what you're seeing a lot of now you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing the fingerprint scanner being </v>

3283
02:31:16.350 --> 02:31:19.630
<v Speaker 3>moved to the back of the device,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you could just do it as you're </v>

3284
02:31:19.630 --> 02:31:19.630
<v Speaker 3>holding it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

3285
02:31:19.630 --> 02:31:19.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

3286
02:31:19.630 --> 02:31:20.040
<v Speaker 3>You'll notice it sort</v>

3287
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:21.180
<v Speaker 2>of fits in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3288
02:31:21.210 --> 02:31:22.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nice.</v>

3289
02:31:22.170 --> 02:31:25.020
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually really clean.</v>

3290
02:31:25.080 --> 02:31:26.510
<v Speaker 2>I've actually got a skin on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3291
02:31:26.690 --> 02:31:27.540
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a skin.</v>

3292
02:31:27.570 --> 02:31:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3293
02:31:28.650 --> 02:31:30.870
<v Speaker 2>It would look a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little more grippy like that.</v>

3294
02:31:31.160 --> 02:31:32.190
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3295
02:31:32.250 --> 02:31:34.080
<v Speaker 2>This is really thin and nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3296
02:31:34.500 --> 02:31:36.440
<v Speaker 2>It's a 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>PM,</v>

3297
02:31:36.750 --> 02:31:37.230
<v Speaker 2>6:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>PM.</v>

3298
02:31:37.231 --> 02:31:42.231
<v Speaker 2>It's the bigger brother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the five x is pretty much identical </v>

3299
02:31:42.231 --> 02:31:45.500
<v Speaker 2>to screens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little lower resolution on physical </v>

3300
02:31:45.500 --> 02:31:45.500
<v Speaker 2>buttons on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just over here on the side.</v>

3301
02:31:45.500 --> 02:31:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

3302
02:31:45.920 --> 02:31:47.010
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all digital.</v>

3303
02:31:48.180 --> 02:31:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at like an iphone,</v>

3304
02:31:49.890 --> 02:31:54.890
<v Speaker 2>that giant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that giant home button increases the </v>

3305
02:31:54.890 --> 02:31:55.460
<v Speaker 2>size of the bezel substantially.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3306
02:31:56.030 --> 02:31:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Another thIng that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that phone makers,</v>

3307
02:31:57.781 --> 02:32:02.781
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember if I talked about this </v>

3308
02:32:02.781 --> 02:32:02.781
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like forward facing speakers.</v>

3309
02:32:02.781 --> 02:32:06.770
<v Speaker 2>It's such a huge thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that we don't have that on a </v>

3310
02:32:06.770 --> 02:32:06.770
<v Speaker 2>lot of devices yet.</v>

3311
02:32:06.770 --> 02:32:07.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The iphone has a little dinky speaker in</v>

3312
02:32:07.761 --> 02:32:08.520
<v Speaker 2>the bond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom.</v>

3313
02:32:08.521 --> 02:32:11.550
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like from a design perspective,</v>

3314
02:32:11.580 --> 02:32:14.550
<v Speaker 2>you can't imagine ever doing a drawing </v>
<v Speaker 2>where for any reason you do that,</v>

3315
02:32:14.551 --> 02:32:19.551
<v Speaker 2>unless it was an absolute necessity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is a lot of filmmakers </v>

3316
02:32:19.551 --> 02:32:22.791
<v Speaker 2>keep trying to slim down the devices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be thinner every single </v>

3317
02:32:22.791 --> 02:32:26.600
<v Speaker 2>generation and so that usually means </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're subtracting things rather than </v>

3318
02:32:26.600 --> 02:32:29.901
<v Speaker 2>adding them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a problem for people who were </v>

3319
02:32:29.901 --> 02:32:32.001
<v Speaker 2>like super into tech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like are you complaining about the </v>

3320
02:32:32.001 --> 02:32:34.761
<v Speaker 2>thickness of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could be a little bit thicker if </v>

3321
02:32:34.761 --> 02:32:34.761
<v Speaker 2>you got better battery life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say a better camera,</v>

3322
02:32:34.761 --> 02:32:34.761
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3323
02:32:34.761 --> 02:32:35.850
<v Speaker 2>Do you need it to be that thin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3324
02:32:35.851 --> 02:32:37.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm good with it the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>

3325
02:32:37.680 --> 02:32:38.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Battery life is fun.</v>

3326
02:32:38.990 --> 02:32:41.220
<v Speaker 2>Like the six plus has a huge battery.</v>

3327
02:32:41.310 --> 02:32:43.620
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty pretty fucking get it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge battery.</v>

3328
02:32:43.790 --> 02:32:45.870
<v Speaker 2>Was actually okay with the six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The six was okay.</v>

3329
02:32:45.880 --> 02:32:47.130
<v Speaker 2>The battery life was not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just.</v>

3330
02:32:47.720 --> 02:32:50.520
<v Speaker 2>I picked up one of these again and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3331
02:32:50.580 --> 02:32:51.720
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the screen better?</v>

3332
02:32:52.620 --> 02:32:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Bigger screen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3333
02:32:53.311 --> 02:32:58.311
<v Speaker 2>Especially for like going on a website </v>
<v Speaker 2>or something like that and reading </v>

3334
02:32:58.311 --> 02:32:58.311
<v Speaker 2>emails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only argument,</v>

3335
02:32:58.311 --> 02:33:01.440
<v Speaker 2>the real argument against the big screen</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one handed use.</v>

3336
02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're.</v>

3337
02:33:02.491 --> 02:33:04.150
<v Speaker 2>If you're a person who takes public </v>
<v Speaker 2>transit,</v>

3338
02:33:04.151 --> 02:33:07.800
<v Speaker 2>you're on the subway and they got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee in one hand and then you can make</v>

3339
02:33:07.801 --> 02:33:09.780
<v Speaker 2>the argument that like any of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>giant phones,</v>

3340
02:33:09.781 --> 02:33:11.730
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult to interact with them one</v>
<v Speaker 2>handed.</v>

3341
02:33:11.790 --> 02:33:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Well then the argument is the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>iphone,</v>

3342
02:33:13.980 --> 02:33:16.660
<v Speaker 2>the one that they've come out with it </v>
<v Speaker 2>the old four inch.</v>

3343
02:33:16.960 --> 02:33:19.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sucker fits right in your hand.</v>

3344
02:33:19.650 --> 02:33:20.230
<v Speaker 2>It's timeless.</v>

3345
02:33:20.950 --> 02:33:23.280
<v Speaker 2>It's so easy to text one handed with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3346
02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:24.630
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of,</v>

3347
02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:28.560
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of lukewarm about it just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's like going backwards.</v>

3348
02:33:28.770 --> 02:33:30.480
<v Speaker 2>It's like what do we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3349
02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:35.600
<v Speaker 2>this stuff I get excited about is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the innovation and the sort of the </v>

3350
02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:38.100
<v Speaker 2>people behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the research development and such.</v>

3351
02:33:38.101 --> 02:33:41.880
<v Speaker 2>And it's like anytime you see a company </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of going back,</v>

3352
02:33:41.910 --> 02:33:43.680
<v Speaker 2>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought about it when I made that,</v>

3353
02:33:43.710 --> 02:33:45.090
<v Speaker 2>when I made a video about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3354
02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:48.480
<v Speaker 2>well if you drive a porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't look all that different.</v>

3355
02:33:48.520 --> 02:33:49.320
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well not only that,</v>

3356
02:33:49.321 --> 02:33:53.160
<v Speaker 2>a porsche small suv it give you invented</v>
<v Speaker 2>of suv and you're like,</v>

3357
02:33:53.161 --> 02:33:55.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to drive an suv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a little shapes around.</v>

3358
02:33:56.030 --> 02:33:56.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3359
02:33:56.340 --> 02:33:57.580
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kinda what that phone is.</v>

3360
02:33:57.581 --> 02:33:59.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like a little sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3361
02:33:59.491 --> 02:33:59.950
<v Speaker 2>You could make.</v>

3362
02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:01.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's fast.</v>

3363
02:34:01.350 --> 02:34:03.060
<v Speaker 2>It's fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They upGraded the camera.</v>

3364
02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:04.320
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3365
02:34:04.350 --> 02:34:07.590
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I feel like we could've seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new design.</v>

3366
02:34:07.591 --> 02:34:08.700
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would have been interesting.</v>

3367
02:34:08.701 --> 02:34:13.701
<v Speaker 2>They've had a lot of time to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they wanted to do with a smaller </v>

3368
02:34:13.701 --> 02:34:14.130
<v Speaker 2>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the edgy of that old phone,</v>

3369
02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:15.320
<v Speaker 2>super grid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big grips.</v>

3370
02:34:15.580 --> 02:34:20.580
<v Speaker 2>It's got us a angular sort of edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one right in your hand.</v>

3371
02:34:20.651 --> 02:34:22.990
<v Speaker 2>One of the slippery as phones is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3372
02:34:23.230 --> 02:34:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I like this scan.</v>

3373
02:34:24.401 --> 02:34:29.401
<v Speaker 2>I gOt the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got texture on the outside and it </v>

3374
02:34:29.401 --> 02:34:29.401
<v Speaker 2>would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3375
02:34:29.401 --> 02:34:29.401
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

3376
02:34:29.401 --> 02:34:29.401
<v Speaker 2>you're gripping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3377
02:34:29.401 --> 02:34:31.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the issue with the Next iphone,</v>

3378
02:34:31.721 --> 02:34:33.100
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm going to ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe.</v>

3379
02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:38.400
<v Speaker 2>There's a rumors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably beyond rumors that </v>

3380
02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:38.680
<v Speaker 2>they're going to give up the headphone </v>
<v Speaker 2>jack.</v>

3381
02:34:39.310 --> 02:34:40.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's gross.</v>

3382
02:34:40.720 --> 02:34:41.670
<v Speaker 2>You're not happy about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3383
02:34:41.860 --> 02:34:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I think that's gross.</v>

3384
02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut the shit.</v>

3385
02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:45.430
<v Speaker 2>What if you're going to get improved </v>
<v Speaker 2>audio,</v>

3386
02:34:45.940 --> 02:34:47.610
<v Speaker 2>how much improved?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

3387
02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:52.640
<v Speaker 2>You just making things proprietary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're trying to sell a fuck ton </v>

3388
02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:53.180
<v Speaker 2>of beats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Headphones when they're trying to do.</v>

3389
02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:59.160
<v Speaker 2>And then also the problem with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you gonna be able to charge it at </v>

3390
02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:00.020
<v Speaker 2>the same time as listening to music?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it gonna be one of the little things.</v>

3391
02:35:00.021 --> 02:35:02.470
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had an idea,</v>

3392
02:35:04.510 --> 02:35:05.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna put it out there because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do it.</v>

3393
02:35:05.981 --> 02:35:10.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm too fucking busy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like up for a set of headphones that</v>

3394
02:35:10.160 --> 02:35:15.160
<v Speaker 2>use that port that actually have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>battery that charge your phone while </v>

3395
02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:18.451
<v Speaker 2>you're listening because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people carry around backup </v>

3396
02:35:18.451 --> 02:35:18.451
<v Speaker 2>batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone?</v>

3397
02:35:18.451 --> 02:35:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone that's not a bad idea.</v>

3398
02:35:18.670 --> 02:35:20.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to makE it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

3399
02:35:20.531 --> 02:35:22.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally a bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>

3400
02:35:22.541 --> 02:35:27.541
<v Speaker 2>the point being is it's not universal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you couldn't just be over at your </v>

3401
02:35:27.541 --> 02:35:27.541
<v Speaker 2>friends and grab it.</v>

3402
02:35:27.541 --> 02:35:32.350
<v Speaker 2>Any pair of headphones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this stuff you may be already </v>

3403
02:35:32.350 --> 02:35:32.350
<v Speaker 2>invested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people have invested a lot into</v>

3404
02:35:32.350 --> 02:35:37.201
<v Speaker 2>audio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything fits with this three point </v>

3405
02:35:37.201 --> 02:35:39.220
<v Speaker 2>five millimeter universal jack and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been that way for god.</v>

3406
02:35:39.640 --> 02:35:41.200
<v Speaker 2>Fifty years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

3407
02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:46.620
<v Speaker 2>more than 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It used to be a quarter inch jack like </v>

3408
02:35:46.620 --> 02:35:47.260
<v Speaker 2>this stuff here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which could be adapted,</v>

3409
02:35:47.261 --> 02:35:52.261
<v Speaker 2>but essentially it's been that analog </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection for as long as there's been </v>

3410
02:35:52.261 --> 02:35:52.270
<v Speaker 2>audio equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is a big move.</v>

3411
02:35:52.300 --> 02:35:57.300
<v Speaker 2>If the leader in the marketplace gives </v>
<v Speaker 2>up on that and goes with the strictly </v>

3412
02:35:57.300 --> 02:36:01.171
<v Speaker 2>digital connection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can expect all the other people to </v>

3413
02:36:01.171 --> 02:36:01.960
<v Speaker 2>follow suit because apple just has that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of pull.</v>

3414
02:36:02.020 --> 02:36:07.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were the first ones to abandon the </v>

3415
02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:07.020
<v Speaker 2>floppy disk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that,</v>

3416
02:36:07.020 --> 02:36:08.120
<v Speaker 2>and then they abandon everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3417
02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:10.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean the new ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this new laptops,</v>

3418
02:36:10.601 --> 02:36:12.250
<v Speaker 2>they don't even have a usb.</v>

3419
02:36:12.580 --> 02:36:17.580
<v Speaker 2>They just have the see usbc port to </v>
<v Speaker 2>provide power to interface with it.</v>

3420
02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:25.960
<v Speaker 2>It should really should have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the pc manufacturers with </v>

3421
02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:28.480
<v Speaker 2>competitive products to that mac book </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to usbc ports.</v>

3422
02:36:28.570 --> 02:36:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that they're trying to </v>

3423
02:36:33.570 --> 02:36:35.461
<v Speaker 2>establish the cloud?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it to try to encourage people to </v>

3424
02:36:35.461 --> 02:36:37.300
<v Speaker 2>upload data to the cloud?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And part of it,</v>

3425
02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:42.420
<v Speaker 2>that's part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but honestly not to be too pessimistic </v>

3426
02:36:42.420 --> 02:36:46.891
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but apple does have a history of this </v>

3427
02:36:46.891 --> 02:36:50.071
<v Speaker 2>sort of planned obsolescence and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fully believe that at least with the </v>

3428
02:36:51.011 --> 02:36:56.011
<v Speaker 2>next generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people were hoping it would be </v>

3429
02:36:56.011 --> 02:36:58.231
<v Speaker 2>this generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll just see that second port and </v>

3430
02:36:58.231 --> 02:36:59.020
<v Speaker 2>they'll go now wIth two boards and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody runs the lineup for it,</v>

3431
02:36:59.021 --> 02:37:00.850
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

3432
02:37:00.910 --> 02:37:02.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two,</v>

3433
02:37:02.110 --> 02:37:07.110
<v Speaker 2>the most controversial thing on the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>version is certainly going to be this </v>

3434
02:37:07.110 --> 02:37:10.501
<v Speaker 2>idea of giving up the headphone jack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that confirmed is pretty fucking </v>

3435
02:37:10.501 --> 02:37:15.061
<v Speaker 2>close question about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't they still be able to let that </v>

3436
02:37:15.061 --> 02:37:16.220
<v Speaker 2>little port the to have headphones that </v>
<v Speaker 2>plug into the charging</v>

3437
02:37:16.220 --> 02:37:18.950
<v Speaker 8>port in a day in adapter?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Humans are new headphones.</v>

3438
02:37:18.951 --> 02:37:23.951
<v Speaker 8>Everyone has to go by,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but that doesn't completely kill </v>

3439
02:37:23.951 --> 02:37:23.951
<v Speaker 8>headphones,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

3440
02:37:23.951 --> 02:37:23.951
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah.</v>

3441
02:37:23.951 --> 02:37:24.260
<v Speaker 8>They could totally</v>

3442
02:37:24.370 --> 02:37:24.910
<v Speaker 5>sticking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>adapt,</v>

3443
02:37:24.970 --> 02:37:29.970
<v Speaker 5>but then you'd have to have some new </v>
<v Speaker 5>thIng in your pocket that you'd hold </v>

3444
02:37:29.970 --> 02:37:29.970
<v Speaker 5>onto</v>

3445
02:37:29.970 --> 02:37:34.650
<v Speaker 8>and have to be an adaptive,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but they could put out just like they </v>

3446
02:37:34.650 --> 02:37:36.661
<v Speaker 8>put on ear buds with every iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They could just give you new ones that </v>

3447
02:37:36.661 --> 02:37:36.730
<v Speaker 8>plug.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah,</v>

3448
02:37:36.731 --> 02:37:38.470
<v Speaker 8>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No doubt.</v>

3449
02:37:38.530 --> 02:37:43.530
<v Speaker 8>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but the problem is you wouldn't be able </v>

3450
02:37:43.530 --> 02:37:43.530
<v Speaker 8>to charge it at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You would have to have one or the other.</v>

3451
02:37:43.530 --> 02:37:48.270
<v Speaker 8>I'm saying that wouldn't be wireless.</v>
<v Speaker 8>ThE new ones they give you wouldn't be </v>

3452
02:37:48.270 --> 02:37:48.520
<v Speaker 8>plugged into the port we charged into </v>
<v Speaker 8>now.</v>

3453
02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:53.640
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what I'm saying is the exact </v>

3454
02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:53.640
<v Speaker 8>charge.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And can I get you on that?</v>

3455
02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:53.920
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3456
02:37:53.921 --> 02:37:56.830
<v Speaker 8>I know there's going to be some drawback</v>
<v Speaker 8>and people are gonna lose their shit and</v>

3457
02:37:56.831 --> 02:37:58.480
<v Speaker 8>then everybody's going to buy the </v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking iphone.</v>

3458
02:37:58.760 --> 02:38:03.760
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's so convenient that it works so </v>

3459
02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:06.701
<v Speaker 5>seamlessly with your laptop and max do </v>
<v Speaker 5>make the best operating system for home </v>

3460
02:38:06.701 --> 02:38:07.760
<v Speaker 5>computers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In my opinion.</v>

3461
02:38:07.761 --> 02:38:12.761
<v Speaker 5>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to try some window shit out </v>

3462
02:38:12.761 --> 02:38:12.761
<v Speaker 5>because razor is gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Send us.</v>

3463
02:38:12.761 --> 02:38:16.781
<v Speaker 5>I heard about this laptop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Am I invited to this party or what I </v>

3464
02:38:17.530 --> 02:38:20.130
<v Speaker 5>getting on the doom party?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're going to have a doom loop.</v>

3465
02:38:20.290 --> 02:38:23.240
<v Speaker 5>You know what you're getting into here </v>
<v Speaker 5>and what went well?</v>

3466
02:38:23.260 --> 02:38:25.490
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean how elaborate will this thing be?</v>

3467
02:38:25.491 --> 02:38:27.560
<v Speaker 5>What kind of systems are you getting?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's happening?</v>

3468
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:30.740
<v Speaker 5>We're probably going to use razors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Laptop systems.</v>

3469
02:38:30.741 --> 02:38:34.350
<v Speaker 5>They have gaming laptops that are pretty</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking financial definitely.</v>

3470
02:38:34.351 --> 02:38:39.351
<v Speaker 5>And so the razor blade,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually was one of the razor </v>

3471
02:38:39.351 --> 02:38:43.280
<v Speaker 5>developers like early back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the nineties.</v>

3472
02:38:43.310 --> 02:38:45.250
<v Speaker 5>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was the one,</v>

3473
02:38:45.270 --> 02:38:47.090
<v Speaker 5>one of the guys who helped them with </v>
<v Speaker 5>their mice.</v>

3474
02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:52.600
<v Speaker 5>Get out of town.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know how much credit you're getting </v>

3475
02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:52.600
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your original raiser guy,</v>

3476
02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:56.950
<v Speaker 5>robert krakoff was a friend of mine and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he was trying to figure it out.</v>

3477
02:38:57.321 --> 02:38:59.270
<v Speaker 5>I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think at e three.</v>

3478
02:38:59.610 --> 02:39:01.610
<v Speaker 5>Think I met him there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I forgot where I met him,</v>

3479
02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:02.450
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3480
02:39:02.451 --> 02:39:04.310
<v Speaker 5>I was friends with like the software </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys,</v>

3481
02:39:04.311 --> 02:39:09.311
<v Speaker 5>like way back in the day I met john </v>
<v Speaker 5>carmack way back during quake too when </v>

3482
02:39:09.311 --> 02:39:10.100
<v Speaker 5>they were developing quake three.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to play quake three,</v>

3483
02:39:10.101 --> 02:39:13.400
<v Speaker 5>like the early developer model.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would deep man that was deep.</v>

3484
02:39:13.730 --> 02:39:16.550
<v Speaker 5>They had their original.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The razer mamba,</v>

3485
02:39:16.551 --> 02:39:21.551
<v Speaker 5>the original.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that my sensitivity house and </v>

3486
02:39:21.551 --> 02:39:25.300
<v Speaker 5>ergonomically people didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They love the fact that it was like a </v>

3487
02:39:25.300 --> 02:39:28.870
<v Speaker 5>really super sensitive module inside of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it that would the sensor that would pick</v>

3488
02:39:29.691 --> 02:39:31.660
<v Speaker 5>up the movement and it was super </v>
<v Speaker 5>sensitive and high,</v>

3489
02:39:31.820 --> 02:39:34.730
<v Speaker 5>high dpi,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we didn't like the ergonomics.</v>

3490
02:39:34.760 --> 02:39:36.980
<v Speaker 5>THe shape didn't seem right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>what was wrong with the shape?</v>

3491
02:39:36.981 --> 02:39:38.750
<v Speaker 5>Too flat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a really weird shape.</v>

3492
02:39:38.751 --> 02:39:42.620
<v Speaker 5>I had like a hump in the back then it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it leaned forward to a flat front,</v>

3493
02:39:42.621 --> 02:39:45.200
<v Speaker 5>like a duck's foot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was real weird.</v>

3494
02:39:45.350 --> 02:39:47.960
<v Speaker 5>Do you remember the early shane?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to remember it right now.</v>

3495
02:39:47.961 --> 02:39:52.961
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I can pinpoint that in my </v>

3496
02:39:52.961 --> 02:39:52.961
<v Speaker 5>head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3497
02:39:52.961 --> 02:39:55.211
<v Speaker 5>obviously people have different shaped </v>
<v Speaker 5>and sized and also some people employ </v>

3498
02:39:55.211 --> 02:39:55.730
<v Speaker 5>the claw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

3499
02:39:55.731 --> 02:39:57.950
<v Speaker 5>They have a different grip and that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>how you would,</v>

3500
02:39:58.130 --> 02:40:00.310
<v Speaker 5>I guess you'd want a different shape </v>
<v Speaker 5>depending on the grip,</v>

3501
02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:02.480
<v Speaker 5>but there's a lot of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of variables,</v>

3502
02:40:02.481 --> 02:40:04.400
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the variables is do you rest your</v>

3503
02:40:04.401 --> 02:40:09.401
<v Speaker 5>arm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rest your arm or you were hover and </v>

3504
02:40:09.401 --> 02:40:11.960
<v Speaker 5>you guys go with high sensitivity or you</v>
<v Speaker 5>do low sensitive and quick movements and</v>

3505
02:40:11.961 --> 02:40:13.340
<v Speaker 5>do you use,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

3506
02:40:13.410 --> 02:40:15.390
<v Speaker 5>do you use a mouse sampling?</v>

3507
02:40:15.660 --> 02:40:16.230
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3508
02:40:16.231 --> 02:40:19.140
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's like a mouse acceleration.</v>

3509
02:40:19.141 --> 02:40:19.910
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what that is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3510
02:40:19.930 --> 02:40:21.780
<v Speaker 5>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like if you move quicker,</v>

3511
02:40:21.810 --> 02:40:24.390
<v Speaker 5>the mouse actually moves quicker than </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3512
02:40:24.391 --> 02:40:25.200
<v Speaker 5>It like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

3513
02:40:25.230 --> 02:40:30.230
<v Speaker 5>it works on some sort of like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>gyroscope or that's probably not the </v>

3514
02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:31.170
<v Speaker 5>right word,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like excelorometer accelerometer.</v>

3515
02:40:31.290 --> 02:40:35.280
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if you move quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it actually covers distance quicker than</v>

3516
02:40:35.281 --> 02:40:36.270
<v Speaker 5>your movement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It,</v>

3517
02:40:36.530 --> 02:40:40.470
<v Speaker 5>it helps you move quicker and then we're</v>
<v Speaker 5>in find slower movements.</v>

3518
02:40:40.471 --> 02:40:42.390
<v Speaker 5>It slows down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some people like that,</v>

3519
02:40:42.570 --> 02:40:45.930
<v Speaker 5>some people don't like that ending on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>game depending on how you play.</v>

3520
02:40:46.270 --> 02:40:49.020
<v Speaker 5>But for me it was first person shooters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

3521
02:40:49.100 --> 02:40:50.780
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>me and um,</v>

3522
02:40:51.330 --> 02:40:56.330
<v Speaker 5>my friend lou morton who is a hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 5>gamer is one of the writers for news </v>

3523
02:40:56.330 --> 02:40:59.340
<v Speaker 5>radio and a bunch of friends that were </v>
<v Speaker 5>in my clan at the time.</v>

3524
02:40:59.580 --> 02:41:04.580
<v Speaker 5>We got together with the razor guy and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we had a land party and we all </v>

3525
02:41:05.611 --> 02:41:10.611
<v Speaker 5>discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we brought in a bunch of different </v>

3526
02:41:10.611 --> 02:41:12.021
<v Speaker 5>shaped mouse mice and we all showed </v>
<v Speaker 5>which mouse we used and why we used it.</v>

3527
02:41:12.750 --> 02:41:16.250
<v Speaker 5>And I believe at the time I was using a </v>
<v Speaker 5>microsoft mouse and uh,</v>

3528
02:41:16.270 --> 02:41:18.510
<v Speaker 5>I really liked laser mice because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were,</v>

3529
02:41:18.540 --> 02:41:20.160
<v Speaker 5>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>back then they were,</v>

3530
02:41:21.180 --> 02:41:24.630
<v Speaker 5>they were not quite good enough for a </v>
<v Speaker 5>pre games.</v>

3531
02:41:24.631 --> 02:41:26.580
<v Speaker 5>There were a little awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They weren't a sensitive.</v>

3532
02:41:26.590 --> 02:41:27.750
<v Speaker 5>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would miss things,</v>

3533
02:41:27.751 --> 02:41:32.220
<v Speaker 5>but they wouldn't require cleaning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the ball mice required clean not.</v>

3534
02:41:32.221 --> 02:41:32.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3535
02:41:32.851 --> 02:41:35.790
<v Speaker 5>And so we all had these different ones </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we would would use.</v>

3536
02:41:35.791 --> 02:41:40.791
<v Speaker 5>And so they compiled all of our </v>
<v Speaker 5>suggestions and then created their next </v>

3537
02:41:40.791 --> 02:41:42.330
<v Speaker 5>generation mice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this isn't a nine days.</v>

3538
02:41:42.420 --> 02:41:46.610
<v Speaker 5>So I was like one of the early guys that</v>
<v Speaker 5>help them with a shape.</v>

3539
02:41:47.140 --> 02:41:51.060
<v Speaker 5>So imagine all the kids out there right </v>
<v Speaker 5>now with a razor mouse.</v>

3540
02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:56.840
<v Speaker 5>I was just one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of people don't get </v>

3541
02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:56.840
<v Speaker 5>carried away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3542
02:41:56.840 --> 02:42:00.560
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't do that because it was a </v>

3543
02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:01.590
<v Speaker 5>gaming mouse that one of the logitech </v>
<v Speaker 5>logic tac had the best shape.</v>

3544
02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:03.960
<v Speaker 5>I love logitech mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I use one right now.</v>

3545
02:42:03.961 --> 02:42:05.010
<v Speaker 5>I use the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3546
02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:08.760
<v Speaker 5>what is it called?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The performance mx love.</v>

3547
02:42:08.761 --> 02:42:13.761
<v Speaker 5>It wouldn't use anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they had one that was specifically </v>

3548
02:42:13.761 --> 02:42:14.520
<v Speaker 5>designed for gaming and it only had </v>
<v Speaker 5>three buttons,</v>

3549
02:42:14.670 --> 02:42:19.670
<v Speaker 5>but the shape of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the logitech gaming mouse just fit </v>

3550
02:42:19.670 --> 02:42:20.400
<v Speaker 5>perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The 5:18.</v>

3551
02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:24.210
<v Speaker 5>That was a super popular gaming mouse </v>
<v Speaker 5>back in the day but could be.</v>

3552
02:42:24.211 --> 02:42:26.430
<v Speaker 5>I mean they just called it the logitech </v>
<v Speaker 5>gaming mouse.</v>

3553
02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:28.800
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was mostly a gray mouse.</v>

3554
02:42:28.890 --> 02:42:33.890
<v Speaker 5>Didn't have any buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three buttons might be earlier than I'm </v>

3555
02:42:33.890 --> 02:42:34.410
<v Speaker 5>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was kind of crude and primitive,</v>

3556
02:42:34.411 --> 02:42:39.411
<v Speaker 5>but people really loved It because it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was set these buttons for different </v>

3557
02:42:39.601 --> 02:42:44.601
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like some of them would set one of the </v>

3558
02:42:44.601 --> 02:42:44.601
<v Speaker 5>buttons for a jump.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of them would set one of the.</v>

3559
02:42:44.601 --> 02:42:44.640
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would have it,</v>

3560
02:42:44.670 --> 02:42:46.740
<v Speaker 5>I would have the index finger would be </v>
<v Speaker 5>my trigger.</v>

3561
02:42:46.860 --> 02:42:48.540
<v Speaker 5>That's how I would shoot the middle </v>
<v Speaker 5>button,</v>

3562
02:42:48.541 --> 02:42:51.840
<v Speaker 5>would be a rail gun and the far left </v>
<v Speaker 5>button would be a rocket launcher,</v>

3563
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:54.150
<v Speaker 5>so if I wanted a rocket launcher or I'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>hit that far button,</v>

3564
02:42:54.151 --> 02:42:59.151
<v Speaker 5>who would come to me instantly and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>could shoot it and then the rail gun </v>

3565
02:42:59.151 --> 02:43:01.170
<v Speaker 5>would be the one that I would count on </v>
<v Speaker 5>for like a long range sniper shot and so</v>

3566
02:43:01.171 --> 02:43:04.230
<v Speaker 5>you have all your keys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Keys would be in fronT of uwa,</v>

3567
02:43:04.231 --> 02:43:08.340
<v Speaker 5>s and d for movement and then various </v>
<v Speaker 5>weapon keys which are really close,</v>

3568
02:43:08.341 --> 02:43:11.130
<v Speaker 5>like lightning gun was up here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a c you would hit that,</v>

3569
02:43:11.230 --> 02:43:12.130
<v Speaker 5>this and that for that</v>

3570
02:43:12.310 --> 02:43:14.260
<v Speaker 2>and you would configure it based on what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would like.</v>

3571
02:43:14.740 --> 02:43:15.880
<v Speaker 2>And so there was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3572
02:43:16.010 --> 02:43:18.070
<v Speaker 2>that was one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was not the one.</v>

3573
02:43:18.170 --> 02:43:20.660
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is probably right,</v>

3574
02:43:20.810 --> 02:43:23.420
<v Speaker 2>but it's a fun one from the 90th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

3575
02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:25.690
<v Speaker 2>no need but pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty dope.</v>

3576
02:43:25.720 --> 02:43:27.100
<v Speaker 2>That one right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

3577
02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:31.240
<v Speaker 2>They have tons of buttons now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the performance mice now they could</v>

3578
02:43:31.241 --> 02:43:36.241
<v Speaker 2>have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevermind the ones for those massive </v>

3579
02:43:36.241 --> 02:43:36.700
<v Speaker 2>multiplaYer games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3580
02:43:36.790 --> 02:43:39.360
<v Speaker 2>those guys are crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those mice can have like 30,</v>

3581
02:43:39.390 --> 02:43:42.280
<v Speaker 2>40 buttons on it to trigger certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviors.</v>

3582
02:43:42.281 --> 02:43:44.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an expert in that space.</v>

3583
02:43:44.260 --> 02:43:47.590
<v Speaker 2>Those game scare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shit out of me really is massive.</v>

3584
02:43:47.591 --> 02:43:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Multiplayer games are the ones that just</v>
<v Speaker 2>suck your life on.</v>

3585
02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those.</v>

3586
02:43:50.991 --> 02:43:53.020
<v Speaker 2>Those people would just vanished from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

3587
02:43:53.230 --> 02:43:58.230
<v Speaker 2>You know what is going to happen with </v>
<v Speaker 2>those people when they get a little </v>

3588
02:43:58.230 --> 02:43:59.320
<v Speaker 2>something like this to this box that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have in front of us.</v>

3589
02:43:59.710 --> 02:44:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Louis and I were playing with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the show and we had the gentleman</v>

3590
02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:05.730
<v Speaker 2>in that helped work with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3591
02:44:05.740 --> 02:44:10.210
<v Speaker 2>Let me give them a shout out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This master of shapes on twitter.</v>

3592
02:44:10.211 --> 02:44:11.020
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys,</v>

3593
02:44:11.021 --> 02:44:16.021
<v Speaker 2>they create mostly vr experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this headset here is actually an ar </v>

3594
02:44:17.591 --> 02:44:21.190
<v Speaker 2>headset and you may have heard of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's caLled the microsoft hollow lens.</v>

3595
02:44:21.550 --> 02:44:25.030
<v Speaker 2>Essentially you've got a lens in front </v>
<v Speaker 2>of you in a fairly narrow field of view,</v>

3596
02:44:25.031 --> 02:44:30.031
<v Speaker 2>but what ends up happening is you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>this digital representation that's </v>

3597
02:44:30.031 --> 02:44:32.920
<v Speaker 2>overlaid on your own physical space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I would describe it.</v>

3598
02:44:32.990 --> 02:44:34.030
<v Speaker 2>You tried it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe,</v>

3599
02:44:34.031 --> 02:44:34.790
<v Speaker 2>why don't you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3600
02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:36.290
<v Speaker 2>give us some feedback?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3601
02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:39.120
<v Speaker 2>right now it's kind of crude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3602
02:44:39.220 --> 02:44:44.220
<v Speaker 2>there's some holes in it and these are </v>
<v Speaker 2>just developer kit so it's not meant to </v>

3603
02:44:44.220 --> 02:44:46.240
<v Speaker 2>be a polished consumer product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty,</v>

3604
02:44:46.810 --> 02:44:51.810
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty revealing as far as what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>potential is and we're in for a wild </v>

3605
02:44:52.631 --> 02:44:54.280
<v Speaker 2>ride in the next 20 years.</v>

3606
02:44:55.090 --> 02:45:00.090
<v Speaker 2>What we're Seeing with this is a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a crude version of virtual reality in a </v>

3607
02:45:02.021 --> 02:45:04.130
<v Speaker 2>video game where things are coming at </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3608
02:45:04.450 --> 02:45:05.560
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're bullshit.</v>

3609
02:45:06.430 --> 02:45:07.910
<v Speaker 2>They don't look real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3610
02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.720
<v Speaker 2>you're pressing a clicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can shoot them out of the air.</v>

3611
02:45:10.840 --> 02:45:13.390
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My interest in gaming perspective,</v>

3612
02:45:13.391 --> 02:45:18.391
<v Speaker 2>I still think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the vr experiences are a lot more </v>

3613
02:45:18.391 --> 02:45:22.201
<v Speaker 2>immersive than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than something like this where you can </v>

3614
02:45:22.201 --> 02:45:22.201
<v Speaker 2>still see your surroundings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3615
02:45:22.201 --> 02:45:24.050
<v Speaker 2>When you put the headset on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is gone and you're doing like</v>

3616
02:45:24.070 --> 02:45:26.780
<v Speaker 2>some zombie game or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was a.</v>

3617
02:45:27.270 --> 02:45:32.270
<v Speaker 2>So I was playing with the htc vive </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently that most people are saying </v>

3618
02:45:32.270 --> 02:45:33.610
<v Speaker 2>that's the one to get for vr headsets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3619
02:45:33.880 --> 02:45:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over oculus rift.</v>

3620
02:45:35.260 --> 02:45:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the way the tracking is done.</v>

3621
02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:39.160
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very smooth experience.</v>

3622
02:45:39.161 --> 02:45:40.780
<v Speaker 2>They've got controllers that come With </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

3623
02:45:41.650 --> 02:45:44.530
<v Speaker 2>that map against the headset itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were,</v>

3624
02:45:44.580 --> 02:45:49.580
<v Speaker 2>they're wireless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're still wired into huge gaming pc </v>

3625
02:45:49.580 --> 02:45:49.660
<v Speaker 2>via your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of cool.</v>

3626
02:45:49.661 --> 02:45:54.661
<v Speaker 2>Some of the demos I did have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have these digital walls that you </v>

3627
02:45:54.661 --> 02:45:58.030
<v Speaker 2>bump into so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of limits of where you can go.</v>

3628
02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:01.480
<v Speaker 2>But some people have done some really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting things.</v>

3629
02:46:01.640 --> 02:46:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can bring up jamie into the void.</v>

3630
02:46:05.110 --> 02:46:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen this yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3631
02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:09.710
<v Speaker 2>Should I say anything or should we play </v>
<v Speaker 2>the clip?</v>

3632
02:46:09.900 --> 02:46:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3633
02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:12.510
<v Speaker 3>Play the clip into the void.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3634
02:46:12.740 --> 02:46:17.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm curious as to if someone is going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>develop something like those laser tag </v>

3635
02:46:17.740 --> 02:46:18.410
<v Speaker 3>warehouses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>

3636
02:46:18.470 --> 02:46:20.930
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck did you just nail it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did you just nail it?</v>

3637
02:46:20.970 --> 02:46:25.970
<v Speaker 3>That's what we're about to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody in salt lake city built this </v>

3638
02:46:25.970 --> 02:46:28.100
<v Speaker 3>experience where you have this pack on </v>
<v Speaker 3>which if you get shot,</v>

3639
02:46:28.130 --> 02:46:30.770
<v Speaker 3>it's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like an actual physical.</v>

3640
02:46:30.830 --> 02:46:32.720
<v Speaker 3>I think we have talked about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

3641
02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Did this come up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like this came up and one of the </v>

3642
02:46:37.780 --> 02:46:37.970
<v Speaker 3>red band podcasts I'm looking for right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

3643
02:46:38.830 --> 02:46:40.970
<v Speaker 3>Or just void.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something called the voice.</v>

3644
02:46:40.990 --> 02:46:41.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3645
02:46:41.520 --> 02:46:44.180
<v Speaker 3>That might be it because if you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>establish,</v>

3646
02:46:44.210 --> 02:46:49.210
<v Speaker 3>if you can get a place where you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>this enormous warehouse space and then </v>

3647
02:46:49.210 --> 02:46:52.700
<v Speaker 3>in that warehouse space you said it like</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you ever play paint ball.</v>

3648
02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:54.980
<v Speaker 3>Of course I played paintball wants in </v>
<v Speaker 3>boston.</v>

3649
02:46:54.981 --> 02:46:59.981
<v Speaker 3>There's this place in linn that had </v>
<v Speaker 3>these black lights and it was a </v>

3650
02:46:59.981 --> 02:47:02.351
<v Speaker 3>warehouse you would run around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's boxes and those barriers and </v>

3651
02:47:02.351 --> 02:47:02.351
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So here it is right here.</v>

3652
02:47:02.351 --> 02:47:02.351
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here we go.</v>

3653
02:47:02.900 --> 02:47:06.140
<v Speaker 3>We're dream because we become reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3654
02:47:06.141 --> 02:47:11.141
<v Speaker 3>So this girl is walking around and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's actual walls and she turns the </v>

3655
02:47:11.141 --> 02:47:13.220
<v Speaker 3>corner and she's in some fucking magical</v>
<v Speaker 3>land.</v>

3656
02:47:14.660 --> 02:47:16.850
<v Speaker 3>So the computer in this case is in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>backpack.</v>

3657
02:47:17.680 --> 02:47:20.240
<v Speaker 3>So you're completely untethered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god.</v>

3658
02:47:22.390 --> 02:47:26.780
<v Speaker 3>And so they've constructed all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

3659
02:47:27.560 --> 02:47:32.560
<v Speaker 3>unparalleled visuals and body tracking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you're wearing a suit like an x </v>

3660
02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:35.840
<v Speaker 3>men type uniform and it's got sensors on</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3661
02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:38.360
<v Speaker 3>Virtual worlds built over physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>environments.</v>

3662
02:47:38.361 --> 02:47:41.090
<v Speaker 3>I do believe we've talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This looks a little familiar.</v>

3663
02:47:41.091 --> 02:47:42.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting to this part of it.</v>

3664
02:47:42.410 --> 02:47:44.600
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like it looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3665
02:47:44.750 --> 02:47:48.770
<v Speaker 3>I feel like this dated version of what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we've seen that I think they've actually</v>

3666
02:47:48.771 --> 02:47:50.900
<v Speaker 3>launched now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you can actually go do it.</v>

3667
02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:54.050
<v Speaker 3>It's not just a concept for d </v>
<v Speaker 3>environmental effects.</v>

3668
02:47:54.051 --> 02:47:58.070
<v Speaker 3>So you've got air that blows on you yet </v>
<v Speaker 3>know to go along with what's happening.</v>

3669
02:47:58.190 --> 02:47:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Water,</v>

3670
02:47:59.091 --> 02:48:03.170
<v Speaker 3>rain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>explore with and play against others.</v>

3671
02:48:03.230 --> 02:48:08.230
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they wouldn't have to be mapped in </v>

3672
02:48:08.230 --> 02:48:08.230
<v Speaker 3>that physical space as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3673
02:48:08.230 --> 02:48:10.220
<v Speaker 3>at least you're going to move around a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little and get some exercise.</v>

3674
02:48:11.010 --> 02:48:16.010
<v Speaker 3>I kind of liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I liked the idea of actually holding a </v>

3675
02:48:16.010 --> 02:48:17.660
<v Speaker 3>physical gun and being have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having to aim a physical gun.</v>

3676
02:48:18.170 --> 02:48:20.180
<v Speaker 3>Give me some hand eye coordination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

3677
02:48:20.181 --> 02:48:22.460
<v Speaker 3>of course this is how they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>train soldiers now.</v>

3678
02:48:22.520 --> 02:48:23.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big time.</v>

3679
02:48:24.020 --> 02:48:29.020
<v Speaker 3>They're going to get people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good at doing it this way and </v>

3680
02:48:29.020 --> 02:48:29.020
<v Speaker 3>they're going to train them for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>battlefield.</v>

3681
02:48:29.020 --> 02:48:29.930
<v Speaker 3>This is wild man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3682
02:48:29.931 --> 02:48:31.420
<v Speaker 3>jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doom.</v>

3683
02:48:32.420 --> 02:48:37.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can imagine if when that thing </v>

3684
02:48:37.420 --> 02:48:38.831
<v Speaker 3>grabbed hold of you and your vest is </v>
<v Speaker 3>gripping you tighter and you're feeling </v>

3685
02:48:39.321 --> 02:48:44.321
<v Speaker 3>the physical surroundings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to hijack our our sensory </v>

3686
02:48:44.321 --> 02:48:44.321
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Big time,</v>

3687
02:48:44.321 --> 02:48:45.920
<v Speaker 3>especially when it gets better and </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

3688
02:48:45.950 --> 02:48:50.950
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like it's more and more reactive</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you could feel it in very specific </v>

3689
02:48:51.231 --> 02:48:56.231
<v Speaker 3>areas of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If something grabs your shoulder from </v>

3690
02:48:56.231 --> 02:48:59.501
<v Speaker 3>behind you turn it actually has his hand</v>
<v Speaker 3>on your shoulder and the thing is after,</v>

3691
02:48:59.790 --> 02:49:04.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people grow up with those kinds of </v>

3692
02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:04.790
<v Speaker 3>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck are they going to go to the</v>

3693
02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:04.810
<v Speaker 3>movie theater and just sit there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then not.</v>

3694
02:49:05.690 --> 02:49:07.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the move is going to have to ramp it up.</v>

3695
02:49:07.290 --> 02:49:08.070
<v Speaker 3>That will be.</v>

3696
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:09.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll be the equivalent of what it is.</v>

3697
02:49:10.110 --> 02:49:11.660
<v Speaker 2>Maybe disney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the neck,</v>

3698
02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:14.220
<v Speaker 2>maybe some star wars down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be in it.</v>

3699
02:49:14.490 --> 02:49:16.710
<v Speaker 2>Well sometimes though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just want to go to the movies.</v>

3700
02:49:16.711 --> 02:49:17.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to go on a date,</v>

3701
02:49:17.940 --> 02:49:19.890
<v Speaker 2>eat some popcorn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sIt down and relax.</v>

3702
02:49:20.940 --> 02:49:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Although I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean those experiences,</v>

3703
02:49:23.371 --> 02:49:28.371
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows if the next generation will </v>

3704
02:49:28.371 --> 02:49:28.620
<v Speaker 2>give a fuck about any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't need a date.</v>

3705
02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:31.710
<v Speaker 2>They don't need the popcorn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't even need a date.</v>

3706
02:49:31.740 --> 02:49:33.630
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying.</v>

3707
02:49:33.631 --> 02:49:35.280
<v Speaker 2>They got it all figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3708
02:49:35.281 --> 02:49:39.070
<v Speaker 2>They don't need to leave the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is our personality like?</v>

3709
02:49:39.210 --> 02:49:40.830
<v Speaker 2>The collective personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings,</v>

3710
02:49:40.831 --> 02:49:45.000
<v Speaker 2>how much is it going to be affected by </v>
<v Speaker 2>robot sex slaves on hundred percent.</v>

3711
02:49:45.420 --> 02:49:48.390
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one will compromise for anYthing.</v>

3712
02:49:48.420 --> 02:49:49.200
<v Speaker 2>We will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will.</v>

3713
02:49:49.890 --> 02:49:52.140
<v Speaker 2>We will be such ugly motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

3714
02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Or be like completely uneasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3715
02:49:57.030 --> 02:49:58.980
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do not think so.</v>

3716
02:49:59.180 --> 02:49:59.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are you?</v>

3717
02:50:00.180 --> 02:50:02.000
<v Speaker 2>You want to weigh in there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're getting real close.</v>

3718
02:50:02.080 --> 02:50:07.080
<v Speaker 8>demolition man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I feel like all the things that are </v>

3719
02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:07.080
<v Speaker 8>happening with that taco bell is going </v>
<v Speaker 8>to become everyone's favorite meal.</v>

3720
02:50:07.090 --> 02:50:10.870
<v Speaker 8>We're going to have to be what it was in</v>
<v Speaker 8>the movie.</v>

3721
02:50:10.890 --> 02:50:15.890
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>three shells to wipe our Asses and no </v>

3722
02:50:15.890 --> 02:50:15.890
<v Speaker 8>one knows what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 8>StIll.</v>

3723
02:50:15.890 --> 02:50:15.890
<v Speaker 8>And go ahead.</v>

3724
02:50:15.890 --> 02:50:18.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the matrix or whatever scifi film you</v>

3725
02:50:18.691 --> 02:50:23.691
<v Speaker 2>choose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but under ultimately I think we're just </v>

3726
02:50:23.691 --> 02:50:27.441
<v Speaker 2>becoming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We continued to have a smaller slice of </v>

3727
02:50:27.441 --> 02:50:30.630
<v Speaker 2>the pizza and the digital realm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the internet,</v>

3728
02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:33.630
<v Speaker 2>the data realm continues to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger slice of the pizza,</v>

3729
02:50:34.500 --> 02:50:39.500
<v Speaker 2>so as long as that continues in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a direction we're going to,</v>

3730
02:50:40.710 --> 02:50:45.710
<v Speaker 2>we're going to become more and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>passengers and less and less drivers </v>

3731
02:50:45.710 --> 02:50:49.020
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course that that's happening to </v>

3732
02:50:49.020 --> 02:50:51.980
<v Speaker 2>look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you heard about the model </v>

3733
02:50:51.980 --> 02:50:51.980
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

3734
02:50:51.980 --> 02:50:54.390
<v Speaker 2>they moved so many fucking unit sight </v>
<v Speaker 2>unseen.</v>

3735
02:50:54.870 --> 02:50:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Like can you imagine buying a car </v>
<v Speaker 2>without seeing it?</v>

3736
02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:01.530
<v Speaker 2>These people teslas are so proven though</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's elon musk.</v>

3737
02:51:01.531 --> 02:51:04.380
<v Speaker 2>He's like literAlly tony stark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3738
02:51:04.470 --> 02:51:07.260
<v Speaker 2>But all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that hype around it,</v>

3739
02:51:07.760 --> 02:51:09.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't come easy.</v>

3740
02:51:09.180 --> 02:51:11.550
<v Speaker 2>It's all part of kind of a perspective.</v>

3741
02:51:11.550 --> 02:51:14.220
<v Speaker 2>They represent somethIng bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in so many ways.</v>

3742
02:51:14.460 --> 02:51:16.770
<v Speaker 2>tech is like our god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we worship it.</v>

3743
02:51:16.910 --> 02:51:19.740
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] like this is evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in my opinion.</v>

3744
02:51:19.770 --> 02:51:21.480
<v Speaker 2>If you're gonna buy something without </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing it,</v>

3745
02:51:21.481 --> 02:51:25.590
<v Speaker 2>that's the ultimate fucking cult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ultimate coercion,</v>

3746
02:51:25.650 --> 02:51:29.040
<v Speaker 2>but you're only buying it from an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a massively proven brand,</v>

3747
02:51:29.041 --> 02:51:30.600
<v Speaker 2>100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>

3748
02:51:30.601 --> 02:51:35.601
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have many people do that with </v>

3749
02:51:35.601 --> 02:51:35.601
<v Speaker 2>porsche as well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen at with iphones,</v>

3750
02:51:35.601 --> 02:51:39.750
<v Speaker 2>with porsche has a model are that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>comIng out and it's actually very retro.</v>

3751
02:51:40.080 --> 02:51:42.600
<v Speaker 2>the porsche model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our is so spoken for.</v>

3752
02:51:42.601 --> 02:51:45.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a nine slash 11 with a gt three </v>
<v Speaker 2>engine,</v>

3753
02:51:45.301 --> 02:51:48.860
<v Speaker 2>but a six speed manual transmission and </v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3754
02:51:48.890 --> 02:51:53.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of the terminal.</v>

3755
02:51:55.890 --> 02:52:00.890
<v Speaker 2>What am I looking for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A aerodynamic like spoilers and shit </v>

3756
02:52:01.051 --> 02:52:06.051
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a regular nine slash 11 </v>

3757
02:52:06.051 --> 02:52:08.210
<v Speaker 2>and all the aerodynamics is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>built into undercarriage of the car in </v>

3758
02:52:08.210 --> 02:52:11.401
<v Speaker 2>order to keep it down at weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interested in what they've done is made </v>

3759
02:52:11.401 --> 02:52:13.360
<v Speaker 2>a very retro type experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about our electronics?</v>

3760
02:52:13.361 --> 02:52:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3761
02:52:14.231 --> 02:52:16.360
<v Speaker 2>you could shut all that stuff off this </v>
<v Speaker 2>car there.</v>

3762
02:52:16.510 --> 02:52:21.510
<v Speaker 2>There's so few of them that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling this car now for a million </v>

3763
02:52:21.510 --> 02:52:25.090
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a regular fucking nine slash 11 </v>

3764
02:52:25.090 --> 02:52:27.790
<v Speaker 2>that just has like retro capabilities </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's going for,</v>

3765
02:52:27.791 --> 02:52:30.100
<v Speaker 2>people are selling them sight unseen for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a million dollars,</v>

3766
02:52:30.101 --> 02:52:35.101
<v Speaker 2>but I understand it at the high end </v>
<v Speaker 2>because at the high end this is not car </v>

3767
02:52:35.101 --> 02:52:35.440
<v Speaker 2>number one for most people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3768
02:52:35.470 --> 02:52:36.220
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3769
02:52:36.221 --> 02:52:37.180
<v Speaker 2>on a whim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3770
02:52:37.181 --> 02:52:39.400
<v Speaker 2>I have some fucking money burning a hole</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my pocket.</v>

3771
02:52:39.640 --> 02:52:41.950
<v Speaker 2>In the case of the model three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a $35,000</v>

3772
02:52:41.951 --> 02:52:44.810
<v Speaker 2>car and he wasn't that more </v>
<v Speaker 2>understandable then.</v>

3773
02:52:45.850 --> 02:52:47.560
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's less of a risk.</v>

3774
02:52:47.561 --> 02:52:47.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3775
02:52:47.800 --> 02:52:49.390
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about volume.</v>

3776
02:52:49.720 --> 02:52:53.170
<v Speaker 2>So I looked at their numbers and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>went and referenced it against like what</v>

3777
02:52:53.171 --> 02:52:54.340
<v Speaker 2>about honda civic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about,</v>

3778
02:52:54.341 --> 02:52:57.040
<v Speaker 2>how significant is this number?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm sure porsche is only gonna.</v>

3779
02:52:57.041 --> 02:52:58.750
<v Speaker 2>Make 50 of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3780
02:52:58.751 --> 02:53:01.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many for north America.</v>

3781
02:53:01.301 --> 02:53:03.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in those cases you understand it like</v>

3782
02:53:03.671 --> 02:53:07.450
<v Speaker 2>it's super exclusive and probably make </v>
<v Speaker 2>like 911.</v>

3783
02:53:07.510 --> 02:53:08.920
<v Speaker 2>That's probably what they'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3784
02:53:08.950 --> 02:53:13.120
<v Speaker 2>And number one and number nine slash 11 </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be worth the most and whatever.</v>

3785
02:53:13.150 --> 02:53:18.150
<v Speaker 2>But in this case it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's not as much as it can be </v>

3786
02:53:18.150 --> 02:53:19.630
<v Speaker 2>learned from a sort of small experiments</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

3787
02:53:19.870 --> 02:53:21.580
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot more that can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned from when you're,</v>

3788
02:53:21.610 --> 02:53:25.120
<v Speaker 2>when you're moving half a million cars </v>
<v Speaker 2>because then it's like holy fuck,</v>

3789
02:53:25.121 --> 02:53:26.770
<v Speaker 2>this is now an industry trend.</v>

3790
02:53:26.770 --> 02:53:31.770
<v Speaker 2>ThIs is not like some outlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when I saw the numbers and I'm </v>

3791
02:53:31.770 --> 02:53:31.840
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy shit,</v>

3792
02:53:31.841 --> 02:53:34.510
<v Speaker 2>like honda only sold this number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever last week.</v>

3793
02:53:34.511 --> 02:53:39.511
<v Speaker 2>Now we have this significant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We kind of have proof of concept in a </v>

3794
02:53:39.511 --> 02:53:40.120
<v Speaker 2>different way now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3795
02:53:40.510 --> 02:53:45.510
<v Speaker 2>I definitely agree with you there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that the proven brand of tesla </v>

3796
02:53:45.550 --> 02:53:49.930
<v Speaker 2>has gotten people so excited about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's capable of with a smaller,</v>

3797
02:53:50.140 --> 02:53:55.140
<v Speaker 2>less expensive car that like the price </v>
<v Speaker 2>of entry for like the model s or </v>

3798
02:53:55.391 --> 02:53:57.320
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive run 80,000.</v>

3799
02:53:57.390 --> 02:53:58.200
<v Speaker 2>A little too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3800
02:53:58.250 --> 02:54:03.250
<v Speaker 2>So when you come around with $35,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>version of it and it looks pretty dope </v>

3801
02:54:03.250 --> 02:54:04.750
<v Speaker 2>and it has that big laptop screen just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the other ones do.</v>

3802
02:54:04.751 --> 02:54:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Like people just jumped in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3803
02:54:06.730 --> 02:54:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>

3804
02:54:07.780 --> 02:54:11.200
<v Speaker 2>but the part that brought me to tesla in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first place was just the autonomy of</v>

3805
02:54:11.201 --> 02:54:14.350
<v Speaker 2>them [inaudible] they're completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>capable right now of driving themselves.</v>

3806
02:54:14.350 --> 02:54:15.970
<v Speaker 2>They do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a buddy who does it.</v>

3807
02:54:15.971 --> 02:54:17.770
<v Speaker 2>He gets on the highway and texts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3808
02:54:17.771 --> 02:54:22.771
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent is drives and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well apparently the bmw seven series </v>

3809
02:54:22.771 --> 02:54:26.281
<v Speaker 2>does the mercedes benz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they might want you to have your </v>

3810
02:54:26.281 --> 02:54:29.761
<v Speaker 2>hand on the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually asks you to have your hand </v>

3811
02:54:29.761 --> 02:54:29.761
<v Speaker 2>on the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me.</v>

3812
02:54:29.761 --> 02:54:30.880
<v Speaker 2>Still a little bit of sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3813
02:54:30.881 --> 02:54:35.881
<v Speaker 2>See that's the thing is obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's gonna be some friction between </v>

3814
02:54:35.881 --> 02:54:39.211
<v Speaker 2>where we're going and where we're at and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much control we're willing to give </v>

3815
02:54:39.211 --> 02:54:39.940
<v Speaker 2>to these two d systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

3816
02:54:39.941 --> 02:54:41.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting back to the pizza thing,</v>

3817
02:54:41.770 --> 02:54:44.430
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's a huge one if we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing up to,</v>

3818
02:54:44.550 --> 02:54:46.540
<v Speaker 2>if we're willing to give up control of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our vehicles,</v>

3819
02:54:46.541 --> 02:54:51.541
<v Speaker 2>I think we're also probably willing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give up control of a lot of other </v>

3820
02:54:51.541 --> 02:54:51.541
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3821
02:54:51.541 --> 02:54:56.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if we talked about this </v>

3822
02:54:56.280 --> 02:54:56.280
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was this really interesting.</v>

3823
02:54:56.860 --> 02:55:01.860
<v Speaker 2>Was it where did they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I read it or if it was </v>

3824
02:55:01.860 --> 02:55:02.980
<v Speaker 2>on a podcast or how he was relating to </v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook in the early days and how one,</v>

3825
02:55:03.050 --> 02:55:08.050
<v Speaker 2>the biggest issues they had with people </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting tagged in photographs that </v>

3826
02:55:08.050 --> 02:55:09.740
<v Speaker 2>didn't want to be tagged and so they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

3827
02:55:10.040 --> 02:55:12.350
<v Speaker 2>They did this kind of test where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

3828
02:55:12.351 --> 02:55:13.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the hell do we get?</v>

3829
02:55:13.730 --> 02:55:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Allow people to get taken off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>photograph without having to go to their</v>

3830
02:55:16.251 --> 02:55:21.251
<v Speaker 2>friend and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be tagged in that </v>

3831
02:55:21.251 --> 02:55:21.251
<v Speaker 2>photograph because that was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassing thing to do.</v>

3832
02:55:21.350 --> 02:55:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what they did is they put in the </v>

3833
02:55:26.350 --> 02:55:27.650
<v Speaker 2>stock answers like that you can send off</v>
<v Speaker 2>to your friend,</v>

3834
02:55:27.651 --> 02:55:30.030
<v Speaker 2>like select abc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't,</v>

3835
02:55:30.430 --> 02:55:33.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be in that photo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or I look stupid or whatever.</v>

3836
02:55:34.070 --> 02:55:37.490
<v Speaker 2>And the second that they made it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple choice way,</v>

3837
02:55:37.491 --> 02:55:39.950
<v Speaker 2>more people began,</v>
<v Speaker 2>began to use it because they didn't have</v>

3838
02:55:39.951 --> 02:55:41.390
<v Speaker 2>to come up with their own reason.</v>

3839
02:55:42.170 --> 02:55:45.860
<v Speaker 2>They felt like it was more accessible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So humans are low friction,</v>

3840
02:55:45.861 --> 02:55:49.940
<v Speaker 2>like we're lazy as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And many times we get overwhelmed at the</v>

3841
02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:53.420
<v Speaker 2>prospect of having to come up with our </v>
<v Speaker 2>own,</v>

3842
02:55:53.720 --> 02:55:58.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our own method for dealing with the </v>

3843
02:55:58.720 --> 02:56:00.491
<v Speaker 2>awkwardness of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you can imagine in the future if </v>

3844
02:56:00.491 --> 02:56:03.200
<v Speaker 2>these things are phones and the systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>we interact with,</v>

3845
02:56:03.740 --> 02:56:08.480
<v Speaker 2>get really smart at figuring out the </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct responses for certain inquiries.</v>

3846
02:56:08.690 --> 02:56:10.550
<v Speaker 2>Let's say a girl texts you and she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3847
02:56:10.551 --> 02:56:12.770
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet me at 8:00</v>

3848
02:56:12.770 --> 02:56:15.320
<v Speaker 2>PM or call me later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if your phone knows better than you</v>

3849
02:56:15.321 --> 02:56:18.440
<v Speaker 2>are than you do at what the correct </v>
<v Speaker 2>response is?</v>

3850
02:56:18.441 --> 02:56:22.190
<v Speaker 2>If you want to sleep with her later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like here's the 50 percent likelihood if</v>

3851
02:56:22.191 --> 02:56:24.950
<v Speaker 2>you say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this might be the outcome,</v>

3852
02:56:24.951 --> 02:56:28.440
<v Speaker 2>but if you say that you understand where</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going with this most sorta,</v>

3853
02:56:28.470 --> 02:56:32.180
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't take into account </v>
<v Speaker 2>personality and the playful nature,</v>

3854
02:56:32.190 --> 02:56:37.190
<v Speaker 2>the people engaging into account,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how that's attracted it takes into </v>

3855
02:56:37.190 --> 02:56:37.190
<v Speaker 2>account nothing of that.</v>

3856
02:56:37.190 --> 02:56:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you and I are fully aware of that.</v>

3857
02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Facebook has this exorbitant amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>data to say people aren't doing that.</v>

3858
02:56:44.060 --> 02:56:47.750
<v Speaker 2>People prefer to have the fucking stock </v>
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

3859
02:56:47.751 --> 02:56:52.751
<v Speaker 2>Look at emoji.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where the fuck did emoji come from and </v>

3860
02:56:52.751 --> 02:56:54.080
<v Speaker 2>now everybody's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like there's a face for everything,</v>

3861
02:56:54.480 --> 02:56:59.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Used to make your owN fake ones on your </v>

3862
02:56:59.480 --> 02:57:00.350
<v Speaker 2>character and Before that you didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it or don't do that.</v>

3863
02:57:00.351 --> 02:57:02.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't use a mobile as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A way they blew up.</v>

3864
02:57:02.901 --> 02:57:07.901
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's using them now as this </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative form to expressing yourself </v>

3865
02:57:07.901 --> 02:57:10.580
<v Speaker 2>with the tools you have available </v>
<v Speaker 2>beCause they're defacto.</v>

3866
02:57:10.710 --> 02:57:13.160
<v Speaker 2>So tHere's something accepting about </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing,</v>

3867
02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:18.020
<v Speaker 2>answering a multiple choice question </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus one that requires more input from</v>

3868
02:57:18.021 --> 02:57:23.021
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same reason people jump to </v>

3869
02:57:23.021 --> 02:57:24.581
<v Speaker 2>conclusions when they're building a </v>
<v Speaker 2>response or a perspective on any of </v>

3870
02:57:24.581 --> 02:57:24.581
<v Speaker 2>those issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

3871
02:57:24.581 --> 02:57:25.460
<v Speaker 2>I envision a future.</v>

3872
02:57:25.460 --> 02:57:27.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you've ever used any of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wearable devices,</v>

3873
02:57:27.741 --> 02:57:31.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not wearing one right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking bother me way too much.</v>

3874
02:57:31.870 --> 02:57:36.870
<v Speaker 2>This is just a g shock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a plane watch because these things </v>

3875
02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:38.780
<v Speaker 2>like I don't understand how that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>helpful to be quite honest.</v>

3876
02:57:38.830 --> 02:57:41.600
<v Speaker 2>It and interpret it interrupts more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything else.</v>

3877
02:57:41.601 --> 02:57:44.120
<v Speaker 2>It's like the objective was what to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>me to look at my phone less,</v>

3878
02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:44.880
<v Speaker 2>but now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3879
02:57:44.920 --> 02:57:47.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm flashing you in the face every five </v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>

3880
02:57:47.670 --> 02:57:49.610
<v Speaker 2>Like they'd really didn't solve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

3881
02:57:49.611 --> 02:57:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we have to figure out how to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>them better,</v>

3882
02:57:51.531 --> 02:57:54.740
<v Speaker 2>but one thing I noticed immediately on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the apple watch when I was experimenting</v>

3883
02:57:54.741 --> 02:57:58.730
<v Speaker 2>with it was the auto responses for </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions for text,</v>

3884
02:57:58.731 --> 02:58:01.160
<v Speaker 2>for anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would have five or six options.</v>

3885
02:58:01.290 --> 02:58:04.500
<v Speaker 2>How to get back to that person and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of them are perfect,</v>

3886
02:58:04.501 --> 02:58:08.250
<v Speaker 2>but just the easiness of it is why you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to interact with it.</v>

3887
02:58:08.250 --> 02:58:09.180
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck,</v>

3888
02:58:09.181 --> 02:58:11.850
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm not late because I'm at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grocery store,</v>

3889
02:58:12.210 --> 02:58:17.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's easier than pulling out my </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone and telling the person where I </v>

3890
02:58:17.210 --> 02:58:20.121
<v Speaker 2>actually am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How far away do you think we are from </v>

3891
02:58:20.121 --> 02:58:22.290
<v Speaker 2>entire conversations take place with </v>
<v Speaker 2>predetermined questions and answers.</v>

3892
02:58:22.291 --> 02:58:27.291
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying that pizza is shrinking and </v>

3893
02:58:27.291 --> 02:58:30.890
<v Speaker 2>our involvement in any of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meaning of any of this is becoming </v>

3894
02:58:30.890 --> 02:58:32.910
<v Speaker 2>less evident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually it'll be computers talking to</v>

3895
02:58:32.911 --> 02:58:37.620
<v Speaker 2>computers through us and then we'll just</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the vehicle for the delivery and what</v>

3896
02:58:37.621 --> 02:58:39.660
<v Speaker 2>will be the thing that helps it get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that point.</v>

3897
02:58:39.960 --> 02:58:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that the thing that people were </v>

3898
02:58:44.960 --> 02:58:46.341
<v Speaker 2>worried about more than anything anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is artificial intelligence and what </v>

3899
02:58:46.341 --> 02:58:49.851
<v Speaker 2>better way for artificial intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>to emerge then to convince us to stop </v>

3900
02:58:49.851 --> 02:58:50.520
<v Speaker 2>using our own?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3901
02:58:50.820 --> 02:58:52.980
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting.</v>

3902
02:58:53.010 --> 02:58:58.010
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing hack that didn't get </v>
<v Speaker 2>plays on our own inability to put in </v>

3903
02:58:58.010 --> 02:58:58.770
<v Speaker 2>work well.</v>

3904
02:58:58.840 --> 02:59:03.840
<v Speaker 2>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it reduces variables and it cuts down </v>

3905
02:59:03.840 --> 02:59:08.181
<v Speaker 2>the unlikelihood of success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It cuts down on all the possible </v>

3906
02:59:08.851 --> 02:59:13.380
<v Speaker 2>pitfalls and mistakes and chooses a much</v>
<v Speaker 2>more potentially successful scenario.</v>

3907
02:59:13.400 --> 02:59:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what's going on on the web </v>

3908
02:59:18.400 --> 02:59:18.600
<v Speaker 2>on a daily basis when you're on youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that next recommended video comes up</v>

3909
02:59:18.601 --> 02:59:21.330
<v Speaker 2>and it catches your attention that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing,</v>

3910
02:59:21.331 --> 02:59:26.331
<v Speaker 2>inaction and it works and they are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>smartest people in the world of </v>

3911
02:59:26.331 --> 02:59:29.760
<v Speaker 2>engineers sitting around day and night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ab testing what works on joe rogan,</v>

3912
02:59:29.761 --> 02:59:34.761
<v Speaker 2>what works on this other person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then hyper focusing in on the </v>

3913
02:59:34.761 --> 02:59:39.291
<v Speaker 2>success stories and finding the things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are universal and ultimately what </v>

3914
02:59:39.291 --> 02:59:42.270
<v Speaker 2>we ended up finding out is that we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all think we're so fucking unique yet</v>

3915
02:59:42.271 --> 02:59:44.190
<v Speaker 2>our behaviors sake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the complete opposite.</v>

3916
02:59:44.490 --> 02:59:49.490
<v Speaker 2>We all do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shit we're expected to do was so </v>

3917
02:59:49.490 --> 02:59:51.900
<v Speaker 2>fascinated that no one saw any of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming either like 10 years ago.</v>

3918
02:59:51.900 --> 02:59:54.150
<v Speaker 2>no one thought that that was gonna be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>real issue,</v>

3919
02:59:54.151 --> 02:59:59.151
<v Speaker 2>that you're going to have a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>predetermined answers to a phone call </v>

3920
02:59:59.151 --> 02:59:59.151
<v Speaker 2>coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you respond with a text?</v>

3921
02:59:59.190 --> 03:00:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives you a bunch of options.</v>

3922
03:00:00.661 --> 03:00:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>

3923
03:00:01.560 --> 03:00:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Nobody thought that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was like a slippery slope.</v>

3924
03:00:04.140 --> 03:00:05.790
<v Speaker 2>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about how do you trust that?</v>

3925
03:00:06.180 --> 03:00:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Anything you're going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

3926
03:00:09.270 --> 03:00:12.480
<v Speaker 2>is the robot talking to me again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or is it actually you this time?</v>

3927
03:00:12.870 --> 03:00:17.870
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You imagine having those conversations </v>

3928
03:00:17.870 --> 03:00:17.870
<v Speaker 2>with your loved ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your turn,</v>

3929
03:00:17.870 --> 03:00:18.750
<v Speaker 2>your turn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your robotic responses off,</v>

3930
03:00:19.210 --> 03:00:24.210
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what about getting back to </v>

3931
03:00:24.210 --> 03:00:24.210
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3932
03:00:24.210 --> 03:00:26.421
<v Speaker 2>I suck at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about robotic robotic responses </v>

3933
03:00:26.421 --> 03:00:26.421
<v Speaker 2>that mimic the way that you talk?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3934
03:00:26.421 --> 03:00:31.281
<v Speaker 2>because they're analyzing your keyboard </v>
<v Speaker 2>in real time and making suggestions </v>

3935
03:00:31.281 --> 03:00:32.520
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're already pulling the data know,</v>

3936
03:00:32.720 --> 03:00:35.340
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know we're lazy to begin with.</v>

3937
03:00:35.341 --> 03:00:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Now if we can get this system in place </v>
<v Speaker 2>to auto response,</v>

3938
03:00:38.170 --> 03:00:40.350
<v Speaker 2>I can't even get to all the emails I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have right now,</v>

3939
03:00:40.920 --> 03:00:44.070
<v Speaker 2>so if I can turn this guy on when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not available,</v>

3940
03:00:45.060 --> 03:00:48.270
<v Speaker 2>this responder answering emails for </v>
<v Speaker 2>bingo.</v>

3941
03:00:49.140 --> 03:00:50.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you could download your consciousness</v>

3942
03:00:50.881 --> 03:00:53.460
<v Speaker 2>into a robot assistant that knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly what you would say.</v>

3943
03:00:53.520 --> 03:00:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Robot version of me.</v>

3944
03:00:56.760 --> 03:00:59.490
<v Speaker 2>Is it me saying it though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

3945
03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:00.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3946
03:01:02.240 --> 03:01:04.370
<v Speaker 2>What is key here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're getting into like the whole,</v>

3947
03:01:04.371 --> 03:01:07.490
<v Speaker 2>what is consciousness thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if it's transferable.</v>

3948
03:01:07.880 --> 03:01:09.740
<v Speaker 2>If it is transferrable than it would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3949
03:01:09.741 --> 03:01:10.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it essential?</v>

3950
03:01:10.980 --> 03:01:15.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it necessary or are these emotions </v>

3951
03:01:15.980 --> 03:01:17.180
<v Speaker 2>and all these things that we're clinging</v>
<v Speaker 2>to we hold onto so dearly,</v>

3952
03:01:17.181 --> 03:01:20.720
<v Speaker 2>or are they just artifacts of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient primate ancestors?</v>

3953
03:01:20.840 --> 03:01:22.820
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

3954
03:01:22.880 --> 03:01:27.880
<v Speaker 2>I think the cool part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the weird thing to identify is how </v>

3955
03:01:27.880 --> 03:01:32.170
<v Speaker 2>our physiology has been kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system for the distribution,</v>

3956
03:01:32.750 --> 03:01:33.890
<v Speaker 2>like our own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked,</v>

3957
03:01:33.891 --> 03:01:38.891
<v Speaker 2>we started off the podcast talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>entitled people talking about that self </v>

3958
03:01:38.891 --> 03:01:42.830
<v Speaker 2>centric emerging kind of way of living </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you look at these things.</v>

3959
03:01:42.831 --> 03:01:47.831
<v Speaker 2>That's what they needed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They needed us to develop into those </v>

3960
03:01:47.831 --> 03:01:47.900
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to become dependent on them.</v>

3961
03:01:48.050 --> 03:01:51.650
<v Speaker 2>We had to have everything we wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see available on a win.</v>

3962
03:01:52.100 --> 03:01:56.930
<v Speaker 2>For us to become the person necessary to</v>
<v Speaker 2>continue this distribution process,</v>

3963
03:01:57.200 --> 03:02:02.200
<v Speaker 2>we had to rely on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to stop relying on ourselves in </v>

3964
03:02:02.200 --> 03:02:03.890
<v Speaker 2>order to enable the reliance on </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else.</v>

3965
03:02:05.340 --> 03:02:10.340
<v Speaker 2>We shut down our own sort of our own </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of response mechanisms for a lot </v>

3966
03:02:11.041 --> 03:02:16.041
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wake up in the morning and this </v>

3967
03:02:16.041 --> 03:02:16.041
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pick it up,</v>

3968
03:02:16.041 --> 03:02:19.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pick it up and I look at it and my </v>

3969
03:02:19.720 --> 03:02:22.030
<v Speaker 2>fucking neck neck is cranked up and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>in pain and why have I not had a coffee </v>

3970
03:02:22.030 --> 03:02:23.010
<v Speaker 2>yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why am I not on my way to work?</v>

3971
03:02:23.280 --> 03:02:26.610
<v Speaker 2>Why am I not making something that I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible amount of fulfillment out of?</v>

3972
03:02:27.450 --> 03:02:29.070
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

3973
03:02:29.160 --> 03:02:30.900
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people aren't willing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to admit this.</v>

3974
03:02:30.901 --> 03:02:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Nobody ever wants to in it and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something has control over them,</v>

3975
03:02:34.290 --> 03:02:36.680
<v Speaker 2>but like in this particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are plenty of times where you go,</v>

3976
03:02:36.780 --> 03:02:40.920
<v Speaker 2>why am I looking at this right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm still looking your check.</v>

3977
03:02:41.100 --> 03:02:44.880
<v Speaker 2>SomeThing else booked size and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

3978
03:02:44.880 --> 03:02:46.650
<v Speaker 2>Well that's why a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>flipping a flip phone.</v>

3979
03:02:46.651 --> 03:02:50.280
<v Speaker 2>Great transition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a phone in my office right now.</v>

3980
03:02:50.281 --> 03:02:52.320
<v Speaker 2>It's called pumped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bring up a picture of this thing.</v>

3981
03:02:52.790 --> 03:02:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Pumped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's made by a company in Denmark.</v>

3982
03:02:54.870 --> 03:02:59.870
<v Speaker 2>It is the intentionally modern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice to look at dumb phone for people </v>

3983
03:02:59.870 --> 03:03:02.340
<v Speaker 2>trying to get off the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring it up,</v>

3984
03:03:02.850 --> 03:03:06.120
<v Speaker 2>whatever happened to discipline c.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that fair?</v>

3985
03:03:06.900 --> 03:03:08.810
<v Speaker 2>Is it fair?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure it was.</v>

3986
03:03:08.820 --> 03:03:11.820
<v Speaker 2>You leave heroin out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to shoot heroin?</v>

3987
03:03:11.940 --> 03:03:13.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't shoot heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3988
03:03:13.320 --> 03:03:15.450
<v Speaker 2>here's the finish shoot heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have discipline.</v>

3989
03:03:15.660 --> 03:03:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's wonderful,</v>

3990
03:03:17.430 --> 03:03:19.290
<v Speaker 2>but the heroin addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's right there.</v>

3991
03:03:19.291 --> 03:03:20.770
<v Speaker 2>You can't have it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens?</v>

3992
03:03:20.790 --> 03:03:23.310
<v Speaker 2>What happened when they put a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that study?</v>

3993
03:03:23.311 --> 03:03:25.530
<v Speaker 2>That cocaine in the mouse studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3994
03:03:25.531 --> 03:03:26.220
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3995
03:03:26.320 --> 03:03:27.060
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's why.</v>

3996
03:03:27.061 --> 03:03:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Because it's in an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment.</v>

3997
03:03:28.651 --> 03:03:28.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3998
03:03:28.950 --> 03:03:30.750
<v Speaker 2>They were pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were depressed to begin with.</v>

3999
03:03:30.810 --> 03:03:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in a cage and they're in.</v>

4000
03:03:32.731 --> 03:03:37.731
<v Speaker 2>They're being stared at by people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take those same mice and you </v>

4001
03:03:37.731 --> 03:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>leave them in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't be at be happening.</v>

4002
03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mice,</v>

4003
03:03:39.780 --> 03:03:44.780
<v Speaker 2>but here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have data and you have opinion and </v>

4004
03:03:44.780 --> 03:03:47.580
<v Speaker 2>in in big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big fucking digital companies,</v>

4005
03:03:47.581 --> 03:03:52.080
<v Speaker 2>they value one way more than the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>data and the truth of the matter is that</v>

4006
03:03:52.081 --> 03:03:53.640
<v Speaker 2>people can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't keep away.</v>

4007
03:03:53.870 --> 03:03:54.560
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether,</v>

4008
03:03:54.580 --> 03:03:56.850
<v Speaker 2>whether we want to argue it to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4009
03:03:56.851 --> 03:04:00.450
<v Speaker 2>it's like we are the proof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The evidence is out there.</v>

4010
03:04:00.470 --> 03:04:02.810
<v Speaker 2>It's hijacked or curiosity and with </v>
<v Speaker 2>every click,</v>

4011
03:04:02.811 --> 03:04:05.000
<v Speaker 2>something fascinating may come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it doesn't.</v>

4012
03:04:05.270 --> 03:04:06.740
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if it doesn't,</v>

4013
03:04:06.770 --> 03:04:09.470
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like discipline over what?</v>

4014
03:04:09.471 --> 03:04:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Discipline over the way we think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

4015
03:04:12.020 --> 03:04:12.500
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

4016
03:04:12.500 --> 03:04:15.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like we just have to recognize when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes a problem,</v>

4017
03:04:15.201 --> 03:04:16.790
<v Speaker 2>stop using it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4018
03:04:16.791 --> 03:04:18.140
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I again,</v>

4019
03:04:18.141 --> 03:04:21.770
<v Speaker 2>I think that's like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to slow it down.</v>

4020
03:04:22.850 --> 03:04:24.480
<v Speaker 2>Slow it down for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's for sure though.</v>

4021
03:04:24.540 --> 03:04:29.540
<v Speaker 2>Were most people the sort of mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mass movement continues on and find </v>

4022
03:04:29.540 --> 03:04:31.880
<v Speaker 2>this punk thing and we find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4023
03:04:31.881 --> 03:04:35.960
<v Speaker 2>it's p u n k t,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

4024
03:04:35.961 --> 03:04:38.660
<v Speaker 2>They're getting fancy with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can I say?</v>

4025
03:04:38.661 --> 03:04:41.510
<v Speaker 2>They're from Denmark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's how they spell it.</v>

4026
03:04:41.930 --> 03:04:44.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has.</v>

4027
03:04:44.210 --> 03:04:49.210
<v Speaker 2>It has battery life for like two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make phone calls,</v>

4028
03:04:50.120 --> 03:04:50.930
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

4029
03:04:52.010 --> 03:04:57.010
<v Speaker 2>that little guy right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>punkt phone launched at the london </v>

4030
03:04:57.010 --> 03:04:57.530
<v Speaker 2>design festival,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's you call and text.</v>

4031
03:04:58.040 --> 03:05:00.980
<v Speaker 2>It also has nice buttons and it's easy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hold and that's about it.</v>

4032
03:05:02.750 --> 03:05:07.750
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the texting even is that old school </v>

4033
03:05:07.750 --> 03:05:07.750
<v Speaker 2>method of so you're not going to want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

4034
03:05:07.750 --> 03:05:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You press four times to get a z.</v>

4035
03:05:09.440 --> 03:05:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4036
03:05:11.150 --> 03:05:16.150
<v Speaker 2>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the weird thing was for somebody who </v>

4037
03:05:16.150 --> 03:05:17.960
<v Speaker 2>wanted to make this statement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to go by like literally some old</v>

4038
03:05:17.961 --> 03:05:19.790
<v Speaker 2>device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well here's a new one.</v>

4039
03:05:19.990 --> 03:05:23.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a modern design,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's intentionally done.</v>

4040
03:05:24.530 --> 03:05:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what this,</v>

4041
03:05:25.701 --> 03:05:30.701
<v Speaker 2>you know what the designer is saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it is like they're not trying to </v>

4042
03:05:30.701 --> 03:05:31.700
<v Speaker 2>convince people to quit what their </v>
<v Speaker 2>smartphone.</v>

4043
03:05:31.940 --> 03:05:33.500
<v Speaker 2>They're just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

4044
03:05:33.560 --> 03:05:34.910
<v Speaker 2>put a sim card in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set up,</v>

4045
03:05:34.911 --> 03:05:37.340
<v Speaker 2>call forwarding when you go on vacation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and don't.</v>

4046
03:05:37.390 --> 03:05:39.560
<v Speaker 2>And just don't take this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody really needs you,</v>

4047
03:05:39.590 --> 03:05:44.590
<v Speaker 2>they can get in touch with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but otherwise you're not going to have </v>

4048
03:05:44.590 --> 03:05:45.830
<v Speaker 2>that poll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I haven't cracked it open yet.</v>

4049
03:05:45.890 --> 03:05:47.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4050
03:05:47.181 --> 03:05:49.490
<v Speaker 2>I'd like a flip phone better than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>

4051
03:05:49.670 --> 03:05:52.790
<v Speaker 2>Just as flip phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can shut it to hang up,</v>

4052
03:05:52.820 --> 03:05:54.920
<v Speaker 2>which is called hang up.</v>

4053
03:05:54.980 --> 03:05:55.860
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4054
03:05:55.880 --> 03:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I missed that click.</v>

4055
03:05:58.690 --> 03:06:02.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her couch flip phones are cool.</v>

4056
03:06:02.091 --> 03:06:02.930
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

4057
03:06:02.960 --> 03:06:07.960
<v Speaker 2>I had a flip phone too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they took that </v>

4058
03:06:07.960 --> 03:06:07.960
<v Speaker 2>particular approach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think they're interesting because</v>

4059
03:06:07.960 --> 03:06:09.530
<v Speaker 2>they're the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're making that statement as opposed</v>

4060
03:06:09.531 --> 03:06:13.730
<v Speaker 2>to like the flip phone marketplace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just like old leftover phones.</v>

4061
03:06:13.740 --> 03:06:16.970
<v Speaker 2>You can have discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm old school,</v>

4062
03:06:17.000 --> 03:06:19.820
<v Speaker 2>just one such thing and I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use discipline.</v>

4063
03:06:19.850 --> 03:06:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think discipline is fucking </v>

4064
03:06:24.850 --> 03:06:27.281
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the which one of the </v>

4065
03:06:27.281 --> 03:06:27.281
<v Speaker 2>greatest characteristics a human being </v>
<v Speaker 2>can have,</v>

4066
03:06:27.410 --> 03:06:30.230
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you were ready to use it.</v>

4067
03:06:30.231 --> 03:06:32.360
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when it comes to phones,</v>

4068
03:06:32.361 --> 03:06:34.250
<v Speaker 2>I think we have the evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we have the evidence.</v>

4069
03:06:34.260 --> 03:06:39.260
<v Speaker 2>We even you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe you have that moment that I </v>

4070
03:06:39.260 --> 03:06:39.260
<v Speaker 2>spoke of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4071
03:06:39.260 --> 03:06:39.260
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4072
03:06:39.260 --> 03:06:43.951
<v Speaker 2>definitely do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where's the discipline that when I </v>

4073
03:06:43.951 --> 03:06:43.951
<v Speaker 2>realized that I put it down right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's too late.</v>

4074
03:06:43.951 --> 03:06:46.520
<v Speaker 2>He already got you already clicked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but joe and then I realized the next day</v>

4075
03:06:46.521 --> 03:06:49.220
<v Speaker 2>and I don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I check my text messAges when I wake up.</v>

4076
03:06:49.221 --> 03:06:51.500
<v Speaker 2>I look people I care about that actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have my number,</v>

4077
03:06:51.501 --> 03:06:56.501
<v Speaker 2>I look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check my emails or anything super to </v>

4078
03:06:56.501 --> 03:06:56.501
<v Speaker 2>have to get to and</v>

4079
03:06:56.501 --> 03:06:59.000
<v Speaker 3>then I put that fucker down and then I </v>
<v Speaker 3>go about my day.</v>

4080
03:06:59.020 --> 03:07:04.020
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm coming off kind of harsh </v>

4081
03:07:04.020 --> 03:07:06.321
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a guy who like talks about </v>

4082
03:07:06.321 --> 03:07:06.321
<v Speaker 3>technology all the time and it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm shitting on technology.</v>

4083
03:07:06.321 --> 03:07:07.530
<v Speaker 3>You're just recognizing a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>

4084
03:07:07.670 --> 03:07:12.150
<v Speaker 3>And so I'm going to do an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have the punk phone I'm going to do.</v>

4085
03:07:12.151 --> 03:07:13.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm announcing it here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

4086
03:07:13.561 --> 03:07:16.830
<v Speaker 3>so the first time anybody's heard of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because all you have to live on the punk</v>

4087
03:07:16.831 --> 03:07:19.130
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I want to ask.</v>

4088
03:07:19.170 --> 03:07:24.170
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to send you text messages.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing but youtube links would be links</v>

4089
03:07:24.811 --> 03:07:28.910
<v Speaker 3>to websites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to rick roll.</v>

4090
03:07:28.930 --> 03:07:32.550
<v Speaker 3>You just sabotage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a real question for you.</v>

4091
03:07:33.030 --> 03:07:36.870
<v Speaker 3>Coming from your perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long do I need to do it for?</v>

4092
03:07:37.050 --> 03:07:39.210
<v Speaker 3>To really gather the insight necessary </v>
<v Speaker 3>to say,</v>

4093
03:07:39.211 --> 03:07:41.040
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how this thing is changing me.</v>

4094
03:07:41.250 --> 03:07:42.840
<v Speaker 3>I think you should talk to someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>done it.</v>

4095
03:07:42.880 --> 03:07:46.010
<v Speaker 3>Like what you should do is you should </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a conversation with ari shaffir,</v>

4096
03:07:46.020 --> 03:07:50.340
<v Speaker 3>so he's had a text phone or a flip phone</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather for over a year now still.</v>

4097
03:07:50.400 --> 03:07:51.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4098
03:07:51.541 --> 03:07:54.060
<v Speaker 3>He decided he was an addict and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

4099
03:07:54.061 --> 03:07:55.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to change it any other </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

4100
03:07:55.740 --> 03:07:57.780
<v Speaker 3>I tried to say we'll just have some </v>
<v Speaker 3>discipline.</v>

4101
03:07:57.810 --> 03:07:59.850
<v Speaker 3>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not gonna do it because I'm an addict.</v>

4102
03:08:00.090 --> 03:08:05.090
<v Speaker 3>And so he just got a flip phone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all he is is he has a flip phone </v>

4103
03:08:05.090 --> 03:08:08.481
<v Speaker 3>thing that flips two ways so you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>flip it sideways and it actually is a </v>

4104
03:08:08.481 --> 03:08:09.530
<v Speaker 3>full keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can send a reasonable text message.</v>

4105
03:08:09.540 --> 03:08:10.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what he does.</v>

4106
03:08:12.390 --> 03:08:17.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to him and being some people </v>

4107
03:08:17.390 --> 03:08:17.670
<v Speaker 3>have told me that in order to some </v>
<v Speaker 3>study,</v>

4108
03:08:17.671 --> 03:08:21.960
<v Speaker 3>like in order to build a habit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has to be 30 days gets 90.</v>

4109
03:08:22.230 --> 03:08:23.610
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Thirty days.</v>

4113
03:08:34.171 --> 03:08:36.360
<v Speaker 3>Thirty was the high end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consideration.</v>

4114
03:08:36.361 --> 03:08:38.100
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking two weeks.</v>
