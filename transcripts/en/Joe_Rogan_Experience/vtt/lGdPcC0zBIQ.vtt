16
00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 1>he's really fantastically ethical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put it in the back of a book,</v>

17
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:33.660
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't put that one.</v>

19
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Has to be in the back of the book for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

20
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Definitely not in the front.</v>

00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:44.781
<v Speaker 1>superstar of.</v>

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very generously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.530
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>

26
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.310
<v Speaker 1>are you suing the southern Poverty Law </v>
<v Speaker 1>Center?</v>

27
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Is that what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

28
00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an update for everybody because we </v>

29
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.421
<v Speaker 1>crowd funded a lot of the early costs </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the case against the southern </v>

30
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>poverty law center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did they do?</v>

31
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 1>What does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it make that comment please?</v>

32
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Once upon a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yours truly,</v>

33
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.070
<v Speaker 1>a British Muslim of Pakistani origin was</v>
<v Speaker 1>listed in the United Kingdom on the </v>

34
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Thomson Reuters well-check database </v>
<v Speaker 1>under a category red terrorism </v>

35
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.130
<v Speaker 1>designation while at the same time being</v>
<v Speaker 1>listed across the Atlantic in the United</v>

36
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>States by the southern poverty law </v>
<v Speaker 1>center as an anti Muslim extremists.</v>

37
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.960
<v Speaker 1>So I was both a Muslim terrorists and an</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti Muslim extremist according to two </v>

38
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:40.770
<v Speaker 1>separate lists and of course that speaks</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some of the polarization in our times</v>

39
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 1>in how irrational this conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>around extreme Islam,</v>

40
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Islam integration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims in the West has become.</v>

41
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>I sued Thomson Reuters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>check the database.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This database is no joke,</v>

43
00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:56.391
<v Speaker 1>it's like HSBC and and many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many other banks use this database for </v>

44
00:01:56.461 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>background checks on where the clients </v>
<v Speaker 1>can have a bank account with them.</v>

45
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>So as a result of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

46
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Thomson Reuters in their database,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quilliam,</v>

47
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 1>which is a counter extremism </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization I founded 10 years ago,</v>

48
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.410
<v Speaker 1>had his bank accounts shut down in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States because of the Thomson </v>

49
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Reuters wild check database system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>HSBC subscribes to.</v>

50
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we sued them.</v>

51
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>They paid damages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they issued an apology and they,</v>

52
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took my name off this terrorism </v>

53
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>designation list they have on their well</v>
<v Speaker 1>check database module.</v>

54
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe you should back up further</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just give your,</v>

55
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 1>kind of your short form bio in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why would you ever be on a </v>

56
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>terrorist watch list?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that.</v>

57
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

58
00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>the southern poverty law center had </v>
<v Speaker 1>listed me,</v>

59
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an anti Muslim extremist.</v>

60
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.580
<v Speaker 1>So we are also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.200
<v Speaker 1>taking legal action against them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

62
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will get to your point,</v>

63
00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:50.421
<v Speaker 1>but I think just want to say that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just held the law firm on retainer </v>

64
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:55.180
<v Speaker 1>lock and they were the ones that sued </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rolling Stone magazine for that </v>

65
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.840
<v Speaker 1>college rape scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

66
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Successfully got won that case.</v>

67
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Claire Lock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an announcement made here </v>

68
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 1>exclusively with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one else knows this yet.</v>

69
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>We have retained Claire Lock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are writing to the southern poverty</v>

70
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:09.120
<v Speaker 1>law center as we speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

71
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I think they've got wind of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the southern poverty law center as of I </v>

72
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.220
<v Speaker 1>think either yesterday or the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

73
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>they've removed the entire list that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been up there for two years.</v>

74
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>They've removed the entire list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also had Ayaan Hirsi Ali on it and</v>

75
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>it's no longer available on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>

76
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there logic that if you're a critic </v>

77
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.280
<v Speaker 1>of Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a radical fundamentalist Islam that you </v>

78
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>are somehow or another or racist </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremist?</v>

79
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.210
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty much what they've said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you criticize Islam ion myself who </v>

80
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:44.751
<v Speaker 1>have come from within the community and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've had that experience that somehow </v>

81
00:03:44.751 --> 00:03:48.121
<v Speaker 1>that makes us anti Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a number of logical areas </v>

82
00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>involved in that logical leap that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've made.</v>

83
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Do they have any distinction or is there</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that they write that sort of </v>

84
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 1>points to why they would say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

85
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.090
<v Speaker 1>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

86
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:03.091
<v Speaker 1>the reasons they listed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them was that I had a bachelor </v>

87
00:04:03.091 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 1>party in a strip club a year before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got married.</v>

88
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 1>That makes you an anti Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremists.</v>

89
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:09.860
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the reasons listed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

90
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11 hijackers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hijackers were they really listed that I</v>

91
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:23.071
<v Speaker 1>actually listed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the reason why we can </v>

92
00:04:23.071 --> 00:04:23.950
<v Speaker 1>prove malice because what has that got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with anything but that doesn't.</v>

93
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

94
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was,</v>

95
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.500
<v Speaker 1>that was a primary reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the three main reasons </v>

96
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 1>that you listed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another one was again,</v>

97
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.280
<v Speaker 1>false.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

98
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.520
<v Speaker 1>they claimed that I had called for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminalization of the face veil for </v>

99
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Muslim women in the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't true.</v>

100
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.940
<v Speaker 1>I had called for a policy to be adopted </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in banks and airports where you're </v>

101
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.100
<v Speaker 1>not allowed to wear a motorcycle helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also shouldn't be allowed to cover </v>

102
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>your face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a face in the name of religion,</v>

103
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 1>which is very different according to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminalization,</v>

104
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>per se of the face veil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like saying you're not allowed to</v>

105
00:04:56.141 --> 00:05:01.141
<v Speaker 1>wear a motorcycle helmet and the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I believe in the criminalization of </v>

106
00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:01.141
<v Speaker 1>motorcycle helmets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just absurd.</v>

107
00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:06.030
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was a mischaracterization of my </v>

108
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.030
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The artist to.</v>

109
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other one,</v>

110
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:07.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

111
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.400
<v Speaker 1>the reason they don't even read because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they kept changing their reasons at the </v>

112
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 1>actual website has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

113
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>we've got the archive and it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been changing it each time.</v>

114
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>People have been pointing out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupidity of their allegations.</v>

115
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.060
<v Speaker 1>So why do they exist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the southern poverty law </v>

116
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.060
<v Speaker 1>center's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

117
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.720
<v Speaker 1>this is a painful irony because if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>roll back the clock now,</v>

118
00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:30.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 or some odd years there reasons to </v>

119
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:33.931
<v Speaker 1>exist were great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this was the flagship </v>

120
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:37.381
<v Speaker 1>organization that was suing the KKK and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereign citizens and just the,</v>

121
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:42.571
<v Speaker 1>the far right white nationalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian nationalist movements in the </v>

122
00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>US and in some cases to great effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their,</v>

123
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:50.791
<v Speaker 1>and their concern obviously about </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremists hate groups in the US was </v>

124
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.620
<v Speaker 1>totally valid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

125
00:05:54.621 --> 00:05:55.450
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became,</v>

126
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

127
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>now that we will see how morally</v>

128
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.310
<v Speaker 2>confused they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have been shining a light on </v>

129
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.310
<v Speaker 2>them and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

130
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.240
<v Speaker 2>they're this bloated organization that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>been taken way too much money and there,</v>

131
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

132
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.130
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it suffers from other signs of,</v>

133
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.620
<v Speaker 2>of corruption or conflicts of interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But back in the day,</v>

134
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morris dees was bringing the KKK to </v>

135
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 2>court and bankrupt in their various </v>
<v Speaker 2>chapters and that,</v>

136
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 2>that looked fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now the social justice warrior moral</v>

137
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:28.211
<v Speaker 2>panic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral stupidity virus has gotten into </v>

138
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:32.291
<v Speaker 2>their brains and they can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>differentiate someone like Majid from a </v>

139
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:37.601
<v Speaker 2>right wing Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neo Nazi hater of Islam,</v>

140
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or hater of,</v>

141
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of people from the Middle East.</v>

142
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

143
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.850
<v Speaker 2>and so it is with Ayaan Hirsi Ali and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a.</v>

144
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ironically,</v>

145
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:48.050
<v Speaker 2>you're off the website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm on it.</v>

146
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm on it in a far more </v>
<v Speaker 2>transitory way.</v>

147
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:55.241
<v Speaker 2>But the article that was written about </v>
<v Speaker 2>my podcast with Charles Murray by vox </v>

148
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 2>hit the southern poverty law center hate</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch page.</v>

149
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:02.420
<v Speaker 2>And so there you had articles about Neo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazi groups,</v>

150
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.800
<v Speaker 2>articles about the Austin bomber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then me and,</v>

151
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.320
<v Speaker 2>and my podcast with Charles Murray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely want to talk about that,</v>

152
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.960
<v Speaker 2>but I want to give people your </v>
<v Speaker 2>background first,</v>

153
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 2>the reason why you were on the list in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the UK and in the first year</v>

154
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.090
<v Speaker 1>he's had to do with your actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>background.</v>

155
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.930
<v Speaker 1>So I was born and raised in Essex in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United Kingdom.</v>

156
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:27.410
<v Speaker 1>And I came of age in what I now refer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the battle days of racism in the </v>

157
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:32.360
<v Speaker 1>United Kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much has changed since then for the </v>

158
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.880
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in those days there were a serious,</v>

159
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cases of violent racism that I've faced.</v>

160
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.830
<v Speaker 1>A hammer attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>machete attacks by actual neonazis.</v>

161
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:40.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've grown up.</v>

162
00:07:40.591 --> 00:07:42.840
<v Speaker 1>This is the irony of this southern </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty law center listing.</v>

163
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:48.170
<v Speaker 1>I've grown up fighting neo Nazis on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>streets and they've been attacking me </v>

164
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:48.990
<v Speaker 1>with hammers and machetes because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>color of my skin.</v>

165
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.360
<v Speaker 1>And you've got a bunch of white guys in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alabama,</v>

166
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.440
<v Speaker 1>a designating me in the same breath as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would designate,</v>

167
00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:00.480
<v Speaker 1>designate these neo Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that when I grew up in having that </v>

168
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.180
<v Speaker 1>experience being falsely arrested by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Essex police on a number of occasions,</v>

169
00:08:03.181 --> 00:08:07.290
<v Speaker 1>profiled while the genocide in Bosnia </v>
<v Speaker 1>was unfolding against Muslims in Bosnia,</v>

170
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.890
<v Speaker 1>I often say to an American audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm speaking about this,</v>

171
00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:15.891
<v Speaker 1>we all now here with you on the West </v>
<v Speaker 1>Coast in this beautiful new studio you </v>

172
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:17.670
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>congratulations and imagine the genocide</v>

173
00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:22.671
<v Speaker 1>was unfolding on the east coast against </v>
<v Speaker 1>a group of people with whom you </v>

174
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:24.540
<v Speaker 1>identified and even if it's just on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>human level,</v>

175
00:08:24.541 --> 00:08:25.600
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

176
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.860
<v Speaker 1>even within a community identification </v>
<v Speaker 1>would impact you in a way.</v>

177
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.040
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you define yourself as a Jewish and </v>

178
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.420
<v Speaker 1>there was a genocide against Jews on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other side of this continent,</v>

179
00:08:36.421 --> 00:08:38.850
<v Speaker 1>of this very country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it would impact you on,</v>

180
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.830
<v Speaker 1>on the west coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

181
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.060
<v Speaker 1>sorry over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

182
00:08:42.061 --> 00:08:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Eva.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From London,</v>

183
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>it takes us less time to fly from London</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Bosnia than it does from New York to </v>

184
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.160
<v Speaker 1>La.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it really had a profound impact </v>

185
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.741
<v Speaker 1>on Muslims across Europe when that </v>
<v Speaker 1>genocide was unfolding and things were </v>

186
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:55.050
<v Speaker 1>never the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It radicalize an entire generation,</v>

187
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology</v>

188
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:01.370
<v Speaker 3>had a lot to do with that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the anger originally came from the </v>

189
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:01.770
<v Speaker 3>genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So at the age of 16,</v>

190
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:06.890
<v Speaker 3>what with the domestic racism and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation in Bosnia unfolding as it did,</v>

191
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.220
<v Speaker 3>I joined his battalion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a,</v>

192
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a non terrorist still legal in America </v>

193
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 3>and in Britain and across Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Islamist organization.</v>

194
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:22.700
<v Speaker 3>It was the first of the global Islamist </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations that aspire to resurrect </v>

195
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 3>the notion of a caliphate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a which we've subsequently seen to great</v>

196
00:09:25.861 --> 00:09:27.900
<v Speaker 3>damaging effect in the form of Isis </v>
<v Speaker 3>Caliphate.</v>

197
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:29.560
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

198
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.580
<v Speaker 3>the method of coming to power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was by infiltrating militaries in </v>

199
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Muslim majority countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

200
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:38.070
<v Speaker 3>recruiting army officers and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>instigating military coups,</v>

201
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.340
<v Speaker 3>whether that be in Turkey and Pakistan </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Egypt.</v>

202
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:45.380
<v Speaker 3>These are the countries they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they targeted and their aim would be to </v>

203
00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:46.590
<v Speaker 3>them through the military coup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>set up this caliphate,</v>

204
00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 3>which would then be an expansionist </v>
<v Speaker 3>caliphate.</v>

205
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'll conquer the world.</v>

206
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

207
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.340
<v Speaker 3>it sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what they believe.</v>

208
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:58.370
<v Speaker 3>And that's what they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very serious and intent on bringing </v>

209
00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:58.370
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now people,</v>

210
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:01.020
<v Speaker 3>when I say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe me because they've seen the isis</v>

211
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:06.021
<v Speaker 3>experiment unfold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I joined a group that sought to do </v>

212
00:10:06.021 --> 00:10:06.021
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

213
00:10:06.021 --> 00:10:08.580
<v Speaker 3>through non terroristic means are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>age of 16.</v>

214
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:14.030
<v Speaker 3>I ended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ended up on the leadership of that </v>

215
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.030
<v Speaker 3>organization in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 3>UH,</v>

216
00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.500
<v Speaker 3>ended up co founding that group in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan in 1999 where I went,</v>

217
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 3>I left the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went to Pakistan,</v>

218
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:24.080
<v Speaker 3>was among the first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vanguard of British Pakistani </v>

219
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.080
<v Speaker 3>members that went out there to set the </v>
<v Speaker 3>group up.</v>

220
00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:29.300
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been about three or four a </v>

221
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.460
<v Speaker 3>cupelets in Pakistan since an army </v>
<v Speaker 3>officers had been arrested for being </v>

222
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:32.430
<v Speaker 3>members of this group and many of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>still in jail.</v>

223
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.360
<v Speaker 3>I spent a year in Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went back while studying for my degree </v>

224
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.450
<v Speaker 3>in the University of London,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would fly Monday,</v>

225
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.930
<v Speaker 3>would fly on Saturdays and Sundays to </v>
<v Speaker 3>Copenhagen in Denmark.</v>

226
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.810
<v Speaker 3>I cofounded the Danish Pakistani chapter</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this group.</v>

227
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.350
<v Speaker 3>And then the third year of my degree </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was doing law and Arabic,</v>

228
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>resulted in me having to go to an Arab </v>

229
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.410
<v Speaker 3>country for the language you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I chose Egypt.</v>

230
00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:56.270
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

231
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.210
<v Speaker 3>a day before the nine slash 11 attacks </v>
<v Speaker 3>in 2001 I ended up in Egypt.</v>

232
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:03.450
<v Speaker 3>I went to Alexandria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enrolled in the University of Alexandria</v>

233
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.330
<v Speaker 3>to study for the year of Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 3>language,</v>

234
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 3>which was a third year of my degree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

235
00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.000
<v Speaker 3>of course nine slash 11 happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the climate changed.</v>

236
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.070
<v Speaker 3>The security climate change all over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

237
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.020
<v Speaker 3>Something we didn't know about nor </v>
<v Speaker 3>predicted.</v>

238
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.390
<v Speaker 3>And on the first of April,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2002,</v>

239
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.510
<v Speaker 3>my house in Alexandria was rated by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Egyptian state security.</v>

240
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.330
<v Speaker 3>I was blindfolded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My hands were tied behind my back.</v>

241
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.730
<v Speaker 3>I was then driven through the desert </v>
<v Speaker 3>into Cairo,</v>

242
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:34.590
<v Speaker 3>to the dungeon of the state security </v>
<v Speaker 3>headquarters in a building known as a,</v>

243
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.680
<v Speaker 3>as a LG has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the main headquarters of an </v>

244
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:39.680
<v Speaker 3>adult.</v>

245
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:43.450
<v Speaker 3>This internal state security.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were held in the dungeons there for </v>

246
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.960
<v Speaker 3>four days and they electrocuted most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the prisoners that they had.</v>

247
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.270
<v Speaker 3>They're tortured them interrogate to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

248
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.870
<v Speaker 3>On the fourth day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was taken to a prison,</v>

249
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:56.871
<v Speaker 3>known as muzzled Artora in Cairo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put into solitary confinement for about </v>

250
00:11:57.671 --> 00:11:59.770
<v Speaker 3>three and a half months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then charged,</v>

251
00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:04.830
<v Speaker 3>eventually sentenced to five years as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>political prisoner under the Egyptian </v>

252
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:06.310
<v Speaker 3>emergency law.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

253
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.680
<v Speaker 3>and serve my full sentence there in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Egypt,</v>

254
00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:14.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually left prison in 2006 and </v>

255
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.210
<v Speaker 3>returned to the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

256
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:18.980
<v Speaker 3>so did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did Amnesty International gets you out </v>

257
00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.380
<v Speaker 3>at all or they know they only can </v>
<v Speaker 3>interest in paying for my release.</v>

258
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.650
<v Speaker 3>Nobody got me out because that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>finished my full prison sentence.</v>

259
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:29.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what changed me and led to me to be </v>

260
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.210
<v Speaker 3>the man that sits before you today is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>

261
00:12:31.211 --> 00:12:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Sam Amnesty's adoption of me and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

262
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.720
<v Speaker 3>and a few others in the case as </v>
<v Speaker 3>prisoners of conscience.</v>

263
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.420
<v Speaker 3>And they took the very brave and bold </v>
<v Speaker 3>step.</v>

264
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.590
<v Speaker 3>Now looking back at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because keep in mind the context here.</v>

265
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:48.610
<v Speaker 3>This is Bush was president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tony Blair was prime minister and we </v>

266
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:49.600
<v Speaker 3>were in the thick of the war on terror.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were in the middle of it and um,</v>

267
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna see comes along and says we </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree with everything this guy stands</v>

268
00:12:53.141 --> 00:12:55.420
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't believe in using violence</v>

269
00:12:55.421 --> 00:12:59.110
<v Speaker 3>to bring their caliphate about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we will defend their right to say</v>

270
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:01.000
<v Speaker 3>stupid things and they shouldn't be in </v>
<v Speaker 3>prison,</v>

271
00:13:01.001 --> 00:13:02.440
<v Speaker 3>they certainly shouldn't have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>tortured for it.</v>

272
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:08.100
<v Speaker 3>So I'm amnesty adopted us as prisoners </v>
<v Speaker 3>of conscience and I was 24 years old at </v>

273
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:08.100
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

274
00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:12.931
<v Speaker 3>So everything I've just described to you</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened to me up until the age of 24 </v>

275
00:13:12.931 --> 00:13:15.691
<v Speaker 3>when I was in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was the first time in my </v>

276
00:13:15.691 --> 00:13:17.130
<v Speaker 3>relatively young life from 40 now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

277
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.630
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

278
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:23.100
<v Speaker 3>I had never been defended by any </v>
<v Speaker 3>mainstream pillar of mainstream society </v>

279
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.730
<v Speaker 3>in that way before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody had spoken out for me.</v>

280
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:29.970
<v Speaker 3>And that had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real huge kind of emotional impact on </v>

281
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:30.460
<v Speaker 3>my psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

282
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.570
<v Speaker 3>I've said in my autobiography that where</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hot leads,</v>

283
00:13:34.571 --> 00:13:39.571
<v Speaker 3>the mind can follow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I was now willing to consider </v>

284
00:13:39.571 --> 00:13:40.480
<v Speaker 3>alternatives because of amnesties work </v>
<v Speaker 3>campaigning for me.</v>

285
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.700
<v Speaker 3>And so I spent the next four years in </v>
<v Speaker 3>prison,</v>

286
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reading,</v>

287
00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.810
<v Speaker 3>rereading Orwell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

288
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.700
<v Speaker 3>every one of his books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reading Tolkien,</v>

289
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:51.700
<v Speaker 3>reading classic English literature,</v>
<v Speaker 3>studying Islamic theology,</v>

290
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.000
<v Speaker 3>really trying to understand the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>around me.</v>

291
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had four years to do so.</v>

292
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.170
<v Speaker 3>And I spent four years debating and </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussing with,</v>

293
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:04.650
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty much the founders of Egypt's </v>

294
00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:06.691
<v Speaker 3>manger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hottest organizations who are in jail </v>

295
00:14:06.691 --> 00:14:09.000
<v Speaker 3>with me in the same prison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the assassins or the former </v>

296
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.000
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anwar Sadat,</v>

297
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.870
<v Speaker 3>who had been killed in 1981 because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>his peace deal with Israel and his </v>

298
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.771
<v Speaker 3>assassins were in jail with me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd been in prison longer than I've </v>

299
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:16.771
<v Speaker 3>been alive.</v>

300
00:14:16.771 --> 00:14:20.490
<v Speaker 3>And so they had some collective years of</v>
<v Speaker 3>wisdom between them and most of those </v>

301
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:20.490
<v Speaker 3>jihadis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>prisoners I was in jail with,</v>

302
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:25.470
<v Speaker 3>had over the course of those years to </v>
<v Speaker 3>decades and more change their views and </v>

303
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:30.540
<v Speaker 3>reformed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will still conservative religious </v>

304
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:30.610
<v Speaker 3>Muslims something which I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

305
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.230
<v Speaker 3>and I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't claim to be in my,</v>

306
00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:34.120
<v Speaker 3>in my work at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

307
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:39.180
<v Speaker 3>but they were still religious Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there were no longer a extremists </v>

308
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:39.940
<v Speaker 3>and they were no longer what I call </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamists.</v>

309
00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:42.880
<v Speaker 3>People that sought to implement their </v>
<v Speaker 3>version of Islam over society.</v>

310
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:48.390
<v Speaker 3>And so they are in four years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>constant debate and discussion with </v>

311
00:14:48.461 --> 00:14:53.461
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that I knew had more wisdom than </v>

312
00:14:53.461 --> 00:14:53.461
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd been</v>

313
00:14:53.461 --> 00:14:55.940
<v Speaker 1>in jail for longer than I've been alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I my views began slowly changing.</v>

314
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
<v Speaker 1>I read a lot of the books they wrote </v>
<v Speaker 1>about changing their own views and why </v>

315
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.791
<v Speaker 1>they changed and upon my release I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eventually a good few months after my </v>

316
00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:09.701
<v Speaker 1>release,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to leave the organization because </v>

317
00:15:09.701 --> 00:15:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I no longer believed in an ideology that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was prepared to die for.</v>

318
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.820
<v Speaker 1>That is fascinating that the shift came </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in jail.</v>

319
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Speaking with assassin's among many </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

320
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>

321
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:22.810
<v Speaker 1>That is really incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would think that most people think </v>

322
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.331
<v Speaker 1>that when someone goes to jail usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever criminality that they have in </v>

323
00:15:25.331 --> 00:15:26.870
<v Speaker 1>them as segmented and hardened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

324
00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:32.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why mine is an exceptional </v>

325
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:32.340
<v Speaker 1>case because most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

326
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.791
<v Speaker 1>Whether you look at say cotto who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>known as the founding father of modern </v>

327
00:15:36.791 --> 00:15:37.130
<v Speaker 1>day jihadism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started off like me,</v>

328
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.010
<v Speaker 1>a non terrorist Islamist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Egypt's jails.</v>

329
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.510
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very gentle I was held in,</v>

330
00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:46.511
<v Speaker 1>he was tortured and he ended up becoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>the godfather of modern day terrorism </v>

331
00:15:46.511 --> 00:15:49.820
<v Speaker 1>through his book milestones or Marlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three in Arabic,</v>

332
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.660
<v Speaker 1>and yet that in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

333
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I kind of went that bit further to </v>
<v Speaker 1>question everything I believed in,</v>

334
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.660
<v Speaker 1>but that's not normal in most cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you torture people in jail,</v>

335
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:07.690
<v Speaker 1>it ends up hardening and ossifying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology and people become as angry as </v>

336
00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:13.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become the monster that they were </v>

337
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:13.460
<v Speaker 1>seeking to defeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you get out of jail,</v>

338
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.650
<v Speaker 1>what do you do then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I left the group in 2007 and by 2008 </v>

339
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:18.800
<v Speaker 1>in January.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I finished my degree.</v>

340
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:20.510
<v Speaker 1>I had one year left of my undergraduate </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

341
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I graduated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did my masters at the London School of</v>

342
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Economics and political theory and while</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the master's setup Quilliam and </v>

343
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.350
<v Speaker 1>Quilliam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

344
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.500
<v Speaker 1>we bill as the world's first counter </v>
<v Speaker 1>extremism organization.</v>

345
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:37.070
<v Speaker 1>It was meant to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we believe it is bringing us back to the</v>

346
00:16:37.071 --> 00:16:38.150
<v Speaker 1>SPLC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his allegation,</v>

347
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.480
<v Speaker 1>a Muslim response to extremism from </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have lived it and been </v>

348
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:43.560
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

349
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:48.780
<v Speaker 1>my co founders were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't mrs themselves who changed like </v>

350
00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:48.780
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

351
00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Muslims born and raised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

352
00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:53.330
<v Speaker 1>come from the community to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>community based response,</v>

353
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:56.990
<v Speaker 1>a Muslim response to this growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem of extremism.</v>

354
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.390
<v Speaker 1>And this was 10 years ago and Isis </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerged since then,</v>

355
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.090
<v Speaker 1>only demonstrating why this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>response was needed.</v>

356
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:07.330
<v Speaker 1>And so for the southern poverty law </v>
<v Speaker 1>center to designate somebody with my </v>

357
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:07.330
<v Speaker 1>background,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that trajectory,</v>

358
00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.230
<v Speaker 1>with somebody who was prepared to die </v>
<v Speaker 1>for this cause.</v>

359
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:15.170
<v Speaker 1>And so somebody who wanted to address </v>
<v Speaker 1>these problems as a Muslim to call for </v>

360
00:17:16.371 --> 00:17:19.970
<v Speaker 1>reform for the good of my communities as</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed to against them,</v>

361
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:25.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day it can only </v>

362
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:25.020
<v Speaker 1>benefit Muslim communities of extremism </v>
<v Speaker 1>is put back in its box.</v>

363
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them to then list someone like me as</v>

364
00:17:26.871 --> 00:17:29.990
<v Speaker 1>an anti Muslim extremists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just really does shine a light on the</v>

365
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:34.991
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainty of the situation we find </v>

366
00:17:34.991 --> 00:17:37.241
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in absurdity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the lack of real investigation or </v>

367
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.920
<v Speaker 1>backing up their claims with actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts and information.</v>

368
00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:47.921
<v Speaker 1>And that brings me to your story with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles Murray and vox and Ezra Klein </v>

369
00:17:47.921 --> 00:17:50.250
<v Speaker 1>was linger here for a moment that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same problem,</v>

370
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.680
<v Speaker 2>but not only is it a lack of </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation,</v>

371
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:57.681
<v Speaker 2>but when it gets pointed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I forgot the guy's name at the SPLC </v>

372
00:17:57.681 --> 00:17:59.340
<v Speaker 2>who was quarterback in this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't more as ds,</v>

373
00:17:59.341 --> 00:18:04.341
<v Speaker 2>but it was someone high up mark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poetic or the CEO of something coed </v>

374
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.010
<v Speaker 2>I think is the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

375
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.550
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was mark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

376
00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:13.570
<v Speaker 2>he's listed in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's named in the Atlantic article that </v>

377
00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:14.010
<v Speaker 2>first put this on our radar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he.</v>

378
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.610
<v Speaker 2>They just doubled down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the,</v>

379
00:18:15.611 --> 00:18:15.870
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

380
00:18:15.871 --> 00:18:20.871
<v Speaker 2>the error cannot be pointed out clearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to trigger and much less than </v>

381
00:18:21.151 --> 00:18:22.440
<v Speaker 2>apology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

382
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.440
<v Speaker 2>any modulation of the claim.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just.</v>

383
00:18:25.441 --> 00:18:30.210
<v Speaker 2>People just doubled down in the face of </v>
<v Speaker 2>obvious counter evidence and that's,</v>

384
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:35.130
<v Speaker 2>it's just not about a sincere engagement</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the problem.</v>

385
00:18:35.131 --> 00:18:40.131
<v Speaker 2>And there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's this and there's so many </v>

386
00:18:40.131 --> 00:18:40.680
<v Speaker 2>variables here that make it make it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really toxic environment.</v>

387
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.830
<v Speaker 2>But one is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

388
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:47.040
<v Speaker 2>the locus of concern is never the </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual.</v>

389
00:18:47.041 --> 00:18:49.020
<v Speaker 2>It is the group is the tribe and so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

390
00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:54.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like they'll sacrifice any number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of individuals to make the political </v>

391
00:18:55.321 --> 00:19:00.321
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to make a so they don't </v>

392
00:19:00.321 --> 00:19:01.080
<v Speaker 2>completely unrepentant when they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>shown to get it wrong.</v>

393
00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:06.081
<v Speaker 2>And so in your case and an ions case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just such a such a grievous moral </v>

394
00:19:06.151 --> 00:19:10.950
<v Speaker 2>lapse because not only is it is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack on you illegitimate,</v>

395
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:15.480
<v Speaker 2>it actually raises your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your security concerns and it it.</v>

396
00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.260
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a reference point for </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists who are confused,</v>

397
00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.710
<v Speaker 2>who can't follow the plot or don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time to,</v>

398
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.840
<v Speaker 2>to fact check everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you radioactive from the point </v>

399
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:31.221
<v Speaker 2>of view of mainstream journalists </v>
<v Speaker 2>because either they go to the southern </v>

400
00:19:31.221 --> 00:19:33.980
<v Speaker 2>poverty law center site to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 2>who's worth talking to and they see a </v>

401
00:19:34.591 --> 00:19:39.591
<v Speaker 2>page where you're listed as a anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim extremist along with people who </v>

402
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.150
<v Speaker 2>bear very little resemblance to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideologically.</v>

403
00:19:42.151 --> 00:19:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Because there's probably a few people on</v>
<v Speaker 2>there who who could be described as anti</v>

404
00:19:45.571 --> 00:19:50.571
<v Speaker 2>Muslim extremists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here are the 10 people you don't </v>

405
00:19:50.571 --> 00:19:54.921
<v Speaker 2>need to talk to about this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas you're actually one of the most </v>

406
00:19:54.921 --> 00:19:59.001
<v Speaker 2>valuable voices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean objectively one of the most </v>

407
00:19:59.001 --> 00:19:59.040
<v Speaker 2>valuable voices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but probably,</v>

408
00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:01.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can probably count on two fingers,</v>

409
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:06.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone who would rival your voice on </v>

410
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.350
<v Speaker 2>this topic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

411
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.350
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just mind boggling.</v>

412
00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.750
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult trying to keep this </v>
<v Speaker 3>my closest.</v>

413
00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:09.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult.</v>

414
00:20:09.731 --> 00:20:14.731
<v Speaker 3>You can swing it towards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can tweak it to say it's very </v>

415
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:14.731
<v Speaker 3>difficult because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

416
00:20:14.731 --> 00:20:16.780
<v Speaker 3>icon can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't fully explain to anybody what it</v>

417
00:20:16.781 --> 00:20:21.781
<v Speaker 3>feels like to have lived an entire life </v>
<v Speaker 3>from roughly the age of 14 being </v>

418
00:20:21.781 --> 00:20:25.300
<v Speaker 3>consumed by this issue of Muslims in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>west and this question.</v>

419
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.240
<v Speaker 3>And originally getting it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>answering it in one way,</v>

420
00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.840
<v Speaker 3>and then still being consumed by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>topic,</v>

421
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.070
<v Speaker 3>answering it in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I now do,</v>

422
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:38.760
<v Speaker 3>I can't describe to anybody how much </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotionally the toll that it takes to </v>

423
00:20:39.461 --> 00:20:44.461
<v Speaker 3>have your whole life have defined your </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole life by trying to answer this </v>

424
00:20:44.461 --> 00:20:48.100
<v Speaker 3>question and because you for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because</v>

425
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.160
<v Speaker 1>this is a question that concerns you </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I joined these limits group,</v>

426
00:20:51.161 --> 00:20:56.161
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wrong and adopted some really </v>

427
00:20:56.161 --> 00:20:59.371
<v Speaker 1>nefarious ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but did so because I gave a damn and </v>

428
00:20:59.371 --> 00:21:02.911
<v Speaker 1>cared for a genocide that I saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfolding and desperately wanted a </v>

429
00:21:02.911 --> 00:21:04.390
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even when I became an Islamist,</v>

430
00:21:04.391 --> 00:21:09.391
<v Speaker 1>I did so out of care and love and </v>
<v Speaker 1>concern for what I believed was my </v>

431
00:21:09.391 --> 00:21:13.711
<v Speaker 1>community under attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to have a bunch of people come along </v>

432
00:21:13.711 --> 00:21:17.370
<v Speaker 1>and say that I am anti the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>community that I've believer of.</v>

433
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I have fought for all my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

434
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:22.420
<v Speaker 1>and have and my life has been consumed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and defined by this.</v>

435
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:27.750
<v Speaker 1>It really is taking the one thing away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from somebody that they have.</v>

436
00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to jail for this thing.</v>

437
00:21:30.881 --> 00:21:35.881
<v Speaker 1>I have people have died in front of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes from the torture wounds in prison </v>

438
00:21:35.881 --> 00:21:35.881
<v Speaker 1>because of this thing.</v>

439
00:21:35.881 --> 00:21:37.900
<v Speaker 1>To have someone completely ignorant in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>

440
00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.090
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deprive me of having the,</v>

441
00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.930
<v Speaker 1>of being able to claim that I have stood</v>
<v Speaker 1>for my community.</v>

442
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.560
<v Speaker 1>But by instead saying that I'm anti that</v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

443
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:50.230
<v Speaker 1>it really does kind of make you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like crap.</v>

444
00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Jo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did this start happening?</v>

445
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:58.710
<v Speaker 1>This moral panic that you've constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed in these flippant sort of </v>

446
00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:03.391
<v Speaker 1>accusations without real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any real solid objective reasoning </v>

447
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.110
<v Speaker 1>behind calling someone like you or Ion </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hirsi Ali,</v>

448
00:22:08.111 --> 00:22:13.111
<v Speaker 1>who's the victim of female genital </v>
<v Speaker 1>mutilation to say that she's an anti </v>

449
00:22:13.111 --> 00:22:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she's Islamophobic is.</v>

450
00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:20.490
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me it's almost insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me to be prevalent.</v>

451
00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:25.720
<v Speaker 1>This is something that is a common </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentiment today that I don't recall ever</v>

452
00:22:25.721 --> 00:22:28.270
<v Speaker 1>seeing anything like this one or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades ago.</v>

453
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We might have a better sense than I do,</v>

454
00:22:32.701 --> 00:22:37.701
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's become increasingly salient to me </v>

455
00:22:37.701 --> 00:22:42.111
<v Speaker 2>just because I've been doing this work </v>
<v Speaker 2>for better or worse and colliding with </v>

456
00:22:42.111 --> 00:22:42.840
<v Speaker 2>these people more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

457
00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:44.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

458
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.740
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely an export from some </v>
<v Speaker 2>trends in intellectual life that go back</v>

459
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:52.590
<v Speaker 2>50 years or more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

460
00:22:52.591 --> 00:22:53.110
<v Speaker 2>they always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

461
00:22:53.111 --> 00:22:56.360
<v Speaker 2>what postmodernism did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean,</v>

462
00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.070
<v Speaker 2>you can go back further than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just there.</v>

463
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.360
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

464
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:05.660
<v Speaker 2>a framework,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of pseudo intellectual framework </v>

465
00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.790
<v Speaker 2>where facts can't be talked about as </v>
<v Speaker 2>facts.</v>

466
00:23:08.791 --> 00:23:10.860
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're intrinsically political.</v>

467
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.220
<v Speaker 2>They intrinsically convey power </v>
<v Speaker 2>disparities.</v>

468
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

469
00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.060
<v Speaker 2>science is just a tool of power sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

470
00:23:18.061 --> 00:23:20.790
<v Speaker 2>and this goes back a ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is,</v>

471
00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:25.910
<v Speaker 2>it's now seemingly ascendant on the left</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way that is,</v>

472
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.640
<v Speaker 2>is just fairly bewildering amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be only two subjects.</v>

473
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:32.550
<v Speaker 2>Gender and race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the ones that get.</v>

474
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.200
<v Speaker 2>Those are the big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

475
00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we could find more if we take a</v>
<v Speaker 2>minute to think about it,</v>

476
00:23:37.201 --> 00:23:38.040
<v Speaker 2>but there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are,</v>

477
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.850
<v Speaker 2>those are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those certainly dwarf every other.</v>

478
00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:46.890
<v Speaker 1>Those are the ones where there's a wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a wall that you can't get </v>

479
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:46.890
<v Speaker 1>through with reason</v>

480
00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.970
<v Speaker 2>that this isn't quite raised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the way it's drawn.</v>

481
00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:53.000
<v Speaker 2>A lot of energy from concerns about </v>
<v Speaker 2>racism.</v>

482
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

483
00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:00.320
<v Speaker 2>The perception is that Muslims are a </v>
<v Speaker 2>politically beleaguered minority that </v>

484
00:24:03.051 --> 00:24:04.640
<v Speaker 2>have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it is like,</v>

485
00:24:04.641 --> 00:24:06.070
<v Speaker 2>it is a great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean people think there's,</v>

486
00:24:06.071 --> 00:24:07.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's racist to criticize Islam.</v>

487
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Has that made any sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

488
00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:10.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben Affleck being one,</v>

489
00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:13.780
<v Speaker 2>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

490
00:24:13.781 --> 00:24:17.180
<v Speaker 2>this is their minority in Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not a minute.</v>

491
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:22.500
<v Speaker 2>The second biggest religion on earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is we're talking about one point 7 </v>

492
00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.930
<v Speaker 2>billion people in there and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism of Muslim extremism for the </v>

493
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:30.161
<v Speaker 2>most part is focused on societies where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have most cases,</v>

494
00:24:30.351 --> 00:24:34.280
<v Speaker 2>a majority Muslim population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have women and gays and,</v>

495
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:37.190
<v Speaker 2>and freethinkers treated terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

496
00:24:37.191 --> 00:24:38.060
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the,</v>

497
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:39.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the center of the Bullseye in terms of,</v>

498
00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

499
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.940
<v Speaker 2>what one is criticizing when one talks </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the accuracy.</v>

500
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.120
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there was a lot of this stuff.</v>

501
00:24:47.121 --> 00:24:49.700
<v Speaker 3>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this paranoia,</v>

502
00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:54.701
<v Speaker 3>this son of a irrational approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this conversation that Sam suffered from</v>

503
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:57.530
<v Speaker 3>and when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

504
00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.270
<v Speaker 3>when I first met him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

505
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:04.460
<v Speaker 3>I Miss New York at the intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 3>squared debate that heat that.</v>

506
00:25:04.461 --> 00:25:06.610
<v Speaker 3>So Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Douglas Murray,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who I believe you've had.</v>

507
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:07.940
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On this podcast,</v>

508
00:25:07.941 --> 00:25:12.941
<v Speaker 3>we're on one side of a debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on the other side of this debate </v>

509
00:25:12.941 --> 00:25:14.780
<v Speaker 3>and the motion that we were debating was</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam is a religion of peace.</v>

510
00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.830
<v Speaker 3>I was back then arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

511
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:22.870
<v Speaker 3>half of my true belief is because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually don't believe it's a religion </v>

512
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.910
<v Speaker 3>of peace or war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a religion that is interpreted</v>

513
00:25:22.911 --> 00:25:26.810
<v Speaker 3>in different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had to pick a side and so I picked</v>

514
00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:31.280
<v Speaker 3>that side in defending the motion and an</v>
<v Speaker 3>a on an will on the other side.</v>

515
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:36.490
<v Speaker 3>And there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a dinner afterwards for the </v>

516
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:36.810
<v Speaker 3>speakers and Sam was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And imagine you were there as a guest.</v>

517
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:37.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

518
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.260
<v Speaker 3>and so it's my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

519
00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.810
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know who he was at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on an I were locked in conversation,</v>

520
00:25:44.811 --> 00:25:47.720
<v Speaker 3>post debate conversation and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

521
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.690
<v Speaker 3>ion invited Samhsa to have his say and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>

522
00:25:50.691 --> 00:25:52.310
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear what Sam Harris has to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>

523
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:53.300
<v Speaker 3>And so</v>

524
00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:55.680
<v Speaker 2>context is relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're at.</v>

525
00:25:55.681 --> 00:26:00.681
<v Speaker 2>So we had a public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's seen these intelligence squared </v>

526
00:26:00.681 --> 00:26:01.110
<v Speaker 2>debates that are there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very well produced online.</v>

527
00:26:01.111 --> 00:26:02.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that they're televised </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

528
00:26:02.521 --> 00:26:03.750
<v Speaker 2>but they're online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

529
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.850
<v Speaker 2>they get a great theater in Manhattan </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

530
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.610
<v Speaker 2>as an audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a thousand people and,</v>

531
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.750
<v Speaker 2>and John Donvan the journalist is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>impresario.</v>

532
00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.220
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then this was a dinner afterwards,</v>

533
00:26:16.221 --> 00:26:18.150
<v Speaker 2>were the organizers and the participants</v>
<v Speaker 2>been there,</v>

534
00:26:18.151 --> 00:26:23.151
<v Speaker 2>there may be 70 people in the back room </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a restaurant and Majid Nih,</v>

535
00:26:23.941 --> 00:26:28.941
<v Speaker 2>we're not at the same table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thankfully we were like 50 feet away </v>

536
00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:32.691
<v Speaker 2>from each other but facing each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so he was at the table with ion and </v>

537
00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:36.711
<v Speaker 2>the other speakers and at one point that</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone's getting debriefed about how </v>

538
00:26:37.231 --> 00:26:40.140
<v Speaker 2>this went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Ion says why a Sam Harris is here.</v>

539
00:26:40.141 --> 00:26:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to hear what he has to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the debate.</v>

540
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:44.440
<v Speaker 2>And so I look at my budget and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

541
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:49.050
<v Speaker 2>He's either at least 50 feet away from </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and I'm a.</v>

542
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you want me to say what I,</v>

543
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:55.590
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would say so he had made moves in </v>

544
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.510
<v Speaker 2>this debate that I considered </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectually dishonest.</v>

545
00:26:57.511 --> 00:26:58.320
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean,</v>

546
00:26:58.321 --> 00:26:58.780
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

547
00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:00.840
<v Speaker 2>he's playing a game and this is not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>real conversation.</v>

548
00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:05.730
<v Speaker 2>This is a formal academic style of </v>
<v Speaker 2>debate where his job is not to leave his</v>

549
00:27:05.731 --> 00:27:08.730
<v Speaker 2>view open to influenced by the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussions.</v>

550
00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's making a case.</v>

551
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

552
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:16.820
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't know it at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he felt unnaturally constrained by </v>

553
00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:17.550
<v Speaker 2>the format of the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had to argue that Islam is a religion</v>

554
00:27:17.551 --> 00:27:21.210
<v Speaker 2>of peace and some of the moves he made </v>
<v Speaker 2>there I thought were dishonest.</v>

555
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:26.660
<v Speaker 2>And so I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a mom and I remember this more or </v>

556
00:27:26.941 --> 00:27:31.941
<v Speaker 2>less verbatim because we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've since transcribe it into a </v>

557
00:27:31.941 --> 00:27:31.941
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

558
00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:33.870
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

559
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Majid know everyone in this room </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizes that you have the hardest job</v>

560
00:27:38.581 --> 00:27:41.070
<v Speaker 2>in the world and we're all very glad </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're doing it.</v>

561
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:46.070
<v Speaker 2>You have to somehow convince the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation of Muslims that Islam really </v>

562
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:52.520
<v Speaker 2>is a religion of peace and the jihad is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just an inner spiritual struggle and </v>

563
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.110
<v Speaker 2>that it'd be martyrs don't get 72 </v>
<v Speaker 2>virgins in paradise and all the rest.</v>

564
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:59.190
<v Speaker 2>And so my question for you is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this,</v>

565
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.060
<v Speaker 2>do you really believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is the case now?</v>

566
00:28:03.061 --> 00:28:08.061
<v Speaker 2>Or do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that pretending that is </v>

567
00:28:08.061 --> 00:28:08.061
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the case,</v>

568
00:28:08.061 --> 00:28:12.261
<v Speaker 2>is the method by which you will make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>the case that if you just pretend long </v>

569
00:28:12.261 --> 00:28:12.990
<v Speaker 2>enough and hard enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll become so</v>

570
00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:18.130
<v Speaker 3>and the extra line here was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And can you just be honest with us in </v>

571
00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:18.290
<v Speaker 3>the privacy of my final sentence was,</v>

572
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.850
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not on,</v>

573
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.280
<v Speaker 2>we're not televised now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you just be honest with us here?</v>

574
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.240
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

575
00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.660
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I responded immediately and said,</v>

576
00:28:25.661 --> 00:28:27.920
<v Speaker 3>are you calling me a liar?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

577
00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:33.390
<v Speaker 2>Seventy we now 70 people and I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 2>into my second gin and tonic and,</v>

578
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:38.320
<v Speaker 2>and he's given me the sort of Middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>Eastern stare down across.</v>

579
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:40.630
<v Speaker 3>You repeat today said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

580
00:28:40.631 --> 00:28:45.631
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm asking you just hear that where </v>

581
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:45.631
<v Speaker 3>there's no cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you just be honest with us?</v>

582
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:45.631
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you calling me a liar?</v>

583
00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:47.590
<v Speaker 3>And it didn't go too well at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The entire,</v>

584
00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:52.090
<v Speaker 3>everyone on the table kind of went quiet</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't know who this guy was.</v>

585
00:28:52.091 --> 00:28:55.930
<v Speaker 3>I never met him and I should have known </v>
<v Speaker 3>who he was.</v>

586
00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:01.560
<v Speaker 3>And then I think somebody are very </v>
<v Speaker 3>tactfully changed the conversation and </v>

587
00:29:01.991 --> 00:29:03.910
<v Speaker 3>just completely veered off this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'd never,</v>

588
00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.460
<v Speaker 3>I never spoke to them again for another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was it,</v>

589
00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:09.210
<v Speaker 3>a couple of three years we'd never </v>
<v Speaker 3>crossed paths in San.</v>

590
00:29:09.211 --> 00:29:14.211
<v Speaker 3>And the reason I bring this up is that I</v>
<v Speaker 3>was one of those guys that didn't want </v>

591
00:29:14.211 --> 00:29:15.520
<v Speaker 3>to entertain a conversation with Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

592
00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:18.280
<v Speaker 3>based upon the defensiveness when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>came to this topic.</v>

593
00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:23.790
<v Speaker 3>And I think that actually it's important</v>
<v Speaker 3>to say that to people that because you </v>

594
00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:25.060
<v Speaker 3>asked him a question about the Charles </v>
<v Speaker 3>Murray situation,</v>

595
00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:30.330
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than actually wanting to engage </v>

596
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:30.940
<v Speaker 3>with someone on the substance of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>

597
00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.940
<v Speaker 3>that I think in the climate we're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

598
00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:35.890
<v Speaker 3>they're engaging with people based upon </v>
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>

599
00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:36.730
<v Speaker 3>on their feelings.</v>

600
00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:41.820
<v Speaker 3>And those feelings are valid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course everyone has the right to </v>

601
00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.221
<v Speaker 3>their feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we've got to try as hard as we to </v>

602
00:29:44.221 --> 00:29:44.221
<v Speaker 3>detach</v>

603
00:29:44.221 --> 00:29:47.160
<v Speaker 1>those feelings from because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly not what the principle of </v>

604
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.250
<v Speaker 1>charity means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lend the person that you're speaking</v>

605
00:29:48.251 --> 00:29:52.550
<v Speaker 1>to the best possible interpretation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're saying and,</v>

606
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.580
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and allow them to clarify what they mean</v>

607
00:29:54.581 --> 00:29:56.350
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to you putting into their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouths what,</v>

608
00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.570
<v Speaker 1>what they mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and telling them what they mean.</v>

609
00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I learned that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

610
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.500
<v Speaker 1>because then two years later he reaches </v>
<v Speaker 1>out to me and he says,</v>

611
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:08.070
<v Speaker 1>I think we can try again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you willing to have a conversation </v>

612
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.070
<v Speaker 1>with me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

613
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:09.280
<v Speaker 1>and I hadn't originally remembered it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the same guy,</v>

614
00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:14.940
<v Speaker 1>so that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got my foot in the door just because </v>

615
00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:15.490
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know who I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we had this conversation,</v>

616
00:30:15.491 --> 00:30:17.350
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lesson for me because we had this</v>

617
00:30:17.351 --> 00:30:18.420
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

618
00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:23.440
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called Islam in the future of </v>

619
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:23.440
<v Speaker 1>tolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's become a book right?</v>

620
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Published by Harvard University Press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had this conversation that became a </v>

621
00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.420
<v Speaker 1>book that been made into a film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think any couple of weeks now we</v>

622
00:30:28.421 --> 00:30:30.640
<v Speaker 1>hear some news on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's coming up with that.</v>

623
00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.590
<v Speaker 1>So we did a lecture tour of Australia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the people who organize that,</v>

624
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:40.930
<v Speaker 1>she made a documentary that we realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>this lesson to your question and that is</v>

625
00:30:40.931 --> 00:30:45.931
<v Speaker 1>that I am somebody that didn't engage </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him on the substance of his </v>

626
00:30:45.931 --> 00:30:50.161
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually fired a misfire and </v>

627
00:30:50.161 --> 00:30:50.640
<v Speaker 1>emotional misfire on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

628
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:51.190
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

629
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:56.220
<v Speaker 1>on what was really questioning his </v>
<v Speaker 1>motives for asking the question rather </v>

630
00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:57.790
<v Speaker 1>than actually addressing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing the points he was making.</v>

631
00:30:57.791 --> 00:31:00.640
<v Speaker 1>And I think that when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't remember who he was,</v>

632
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I then started the conflict conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>in new,</v>

633
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:08.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without the memory of my original </v>

634
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:08.700
<v Speaker 1>judgment on him and the conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>went really well.</v>

635
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.620
<v Speaker 1>So we've got to somehow be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorce ourselves from that background.</v>

636
00:31:11.621 --> 00:31:12.700
<v Speaker 1>That can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

637
00:31:12.701 --> 00:31:13.900
<v Speaker 1>it can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

638
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:19.080
<v Speaker 1>it takes people have strong character to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to like abandon all preconceived </v>

639
00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:22.660
<v Speaker 1>notions from the past conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just start fresh.</v>

640
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I unfortunately,</v>

641
00:31:24.371 --> 00:31:28.360
<v Speaker 1>this example of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a kind of a signal success has,</v>

642
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:33.600
<v Speaker 1>has caused me to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end kind of miss band a lot of </v>

643
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:38.551
<v Speaker 1>energies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's assuming that trying to </v>

644
00:31:38.551 --> 00:31:40.200
<v Speaker 1>replicate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep thinking I keep walking into </v>

645
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:40.200
<v Speaker 1>another situation and thinking this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

646
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Is that why you deleted twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

647
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:41.910
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

648
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:43.490
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

649
00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:46.540
<v Speaker 1>so you haven't deleted your account?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still on twitter,</v>

650
00:31:46.541 --> 00:31:48.070
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will,</v>

651
00:31:48.071 --> 00:31:49.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on this reason episode,</v>

652
00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:54.841
<v Speaker 1>I use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fascinated by people and their </v>

653
00:31:54.841 --> 00:31:57.700
<v Speaker 1>struggles with social media with like </v>
<v Speaker 1>detaching from it,</v>

654
00:31:57.701 --> 00:32:00.820
<v Speaker 1>reattaching from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting addicted to it.</v>

655
00:32:00.821 --> 00:32:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know so many people that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at their twitter at like 1:00</v>

656
00:32:04.811 --> 00:32:09.811
<v Speaker 1>in the morning before they go to bed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>something pisses them off and then they </v>

657
00:32:09.811 --> 00:32:11.500
<v Speaker 1>can't sleep really common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not,</v>

658
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't consider myself someone who had </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

659
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.880
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real pathology with that amount was,</v>

660
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

661
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>6,000</v>

662
00:32:21.731 --> 00:32:24.880
<v Speaker 1>tweets or 7,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweets over the course of many years,</v>

663
00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:27.430
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not tweeting that much.</v>

664
00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:29.220
<v Speaker 1>I was not even looking that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

665
00:32:29.221 --> 00:32:34.050
<v Speaker 1>I was fairly disengaged and I've never </v>
<v Speaker 1>used facebook as a.</v>

666
00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.170
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just use.</v>

667
00:32:35.171 --> 00:32:36.850
<v Speaker 1>Facebook is kind of a publishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>

668
00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:40.240
<v Speaker 1>I never engaged with comments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was looking</v>

669
00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:44.050
<v Speaker 2>enough and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was one,</v>

670
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.860
<v Speaker 2>it was clearly making me a worse person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

671
00:32:45.861 --> 00:32:46.200
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

672
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:51.250
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reacting to stuff that I didn't </v>

673
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.561
<v Speaker 2>need to react to and it was amplified in</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain criticisms and voices which need</v>

674
00:32:54.891 --> 00:32:56.450
<v Speaker 2>not have been amplified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in this,</v>

675
00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:01.540
<v Speaker 2>in this last case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just turned a create a huge explosion</v>

676
00:33:04.461 --> 00:33:05.990
<v Speaker 2>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in the middle of a vacation,</v>

677
00:33:05.991 --> 00:33:10.970
<v Speaker 2>which I basically torpedoed because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I saw on twitter and it was just,</v>

678
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
<v Speaker 2>it was like the perfect infomercial for </v>
<v Speaker 2>why you don't want to be engaged with </v>

679
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:18.630
<v Speaker 2>your vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How while.</v>

680
00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.800
<v Speaker 2>So I'm in the middle of the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>vacation I've taken with my family for a</v>

681
00:33:21.801 --> 00:33:24.440
<v Speaker 2>very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was at least a year and wow.</v>

682
00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:26.540
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

683
00:33:26.541 --> 00:33:31.541
<v Speaker 2>we're on Hawaii and just like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to put everything down to be </v>

684
00:33:31.541 --> 00:33:32.480
<v Speaker 2>the best father and husband I can be.</v>

685
00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was my intention.</v>

686
00:33:33.921 --> 00:33:36.200
<v Speaker 2>That's what was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

687
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:41.230
<v Speaker 2>it happened for a good solid 24 hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I pick up my phone and I see </v>

688
00:33:43.461 --> 00:33:48.461
<v Speaker 2>that that raises salon and Glenn </v>
<v Speaker 2>Greenwald and Ezra Klein had all </v>

689
00:33:48.461 --> 00:33:51.120
<v Speaker 2>attacked me in the space of an hour just</v>
<v Speaker 2>like now it's,</v>

690
00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.820
<v Speaker 2>this goes out to millions of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was also was asking about the Charles</v>

691
00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:55.460
<v Speaker 2>Murray thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

692
00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth is,</v>

693
00:33:56.421 --> 00:34:01.421
<v Speaker 2>I can't even see what I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't look at what Greenwald had </v>

694
00:34:01.421 --> 00:34:01.421
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

695
00:34:01.421 --> 00:34:03.320
<v Speaker 2>he was circulating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody is video about me,</v>

696
00:34:03.321 --> 00:34:05.900
<v Speaker 2>how I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm a racist in that video.</v>

697
00:34:06.510 --> 00:34:11.510
<v Speaker 2>Reza Aslan blocks me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can't even see what if he attacks </v>

698
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.510
<v Speaker 2>me by name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he blocks me so the hay,</v>

699
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:14.450
<v Speaker 2>so I can't even see what his export.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

700
00:34:14.451 --> 00:34:16.820
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just saw the aftermath of that,</v>

701
00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:17.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of stuff.</v>

702
00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Lots of notifications coming to me with </v>
<v Speaker 2>both of us tagged.</v>

703
00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:26.700
<v Speaker 2>And then Ezra published this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose I should back up a however </v>

704
00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:28.550
<v Speaker 2>painful way to describe what happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

705
00:34:28.551 --> 00:34:33.551
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had Charles Murray on my podcast a </v>

706
00:34:33.551 --> 00:34:36.130
<v Speaker 2>year ago and Charles Murray's this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this a social scientist who published </v>

707
00:34:36.141 --> 00:34:41.130
<v Speaker 2>the bell curve back in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was a book about Iq and,</v>

708
00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:44.480
<v Speaker 2>and success in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in western societies like our own.</v>

709
00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.440
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

710
00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:50.750
<v Speaker 2>it's a book where he worries a lot about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cognitive stratification of society.</v>

711
00:34:50.751 --> 00:34:55.751
<v Speaker 2>We have a society that is selecting more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more for a narrow band of talents </v>

712
00:34:55.751 --> 00:34:58.880
<v Speaker 2>that are fairly well captured by what we</v>
<v Speaker 2>call Iq.</v>

713
00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.930
<v Speaker 2>And there is a kind of winner take all </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation where people are really,</v>

714
00:35:02.931 --> 00:35:04.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>500 years ago,</v>

715
00:35:04.911 --> 00:35:08.060
<v Speaker 2>if you had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very high Iq and you're,</v>

716
00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.130
<v Speaker 2>you're just pushing a plow next to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbor.</v>

717
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:15.130
<v Speaker 2>You had no real advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now you can start a hedge fund or </v>

718
00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:15.590
<v Speaker 2>you can start a software company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're,</v>

719
00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:19.730
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing this real shocking </v>
<v Speaker 2>disparity.</v>

720
00:35:19.731 --> 00:35:21.980
<v Speaker 2>And in a good fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

721
00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:23.810
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

722
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:25.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wrote this book,</v>

723
00:35:25.701 --> 00:35:30.100
<v Speaker 2>it had a chapter on race which talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the disparities in,</v>

724
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:35.240
<v Speaker 2>in racial groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>statistically observed disparities.</v>

725
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.770
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

726
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:42.830
<v Speaker 2>the claim about the source of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>disparities was by even the standards of</v>

727
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:46.530
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly the standards of today and</v>

728
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.400
<v Speaker 2>incredibly tepid mealy mouthed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just hand waving.</v>

729
00:35:50.401 --> 00:35:52.740
<v Speaker 2>It was not this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

730
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.220
<v Speaker 2>here comes the Third Reich Declaration </v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

731
00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.640
<v Speaker 2>of white supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was undoubtedly,</v>

732
00:35:59.641 --> 00:36:04.641
<v Speaker 2>there are environmental engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etic reasons for this and we don't </v>

733
00:36:04.641 --> 00:36:05.070
<v Speaker 2>understand them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

734
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:08.280
<v Speaker 2>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think that is one or the other.</v>

735
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.890
<v Speaker 2>We're not in a position to know what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mix is of,</v>

736
00:36:10.891 --> 00:36:12.270
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of influences now.</v>

737
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is a virtually any honest </v>

738
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.220
<v Speaker 2>scientists take on the matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

739
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 2>and certainly today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

740
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.980
<v Speaker 2>it's only become more so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

741
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:26.700
<v Speaker 2>but that went off like a nuclear bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

742
00:36:26.701 --> 00:36:28.800
<v Speaker 2>that was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was such a,</v>

743
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

744
00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the most,</v>

745
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:33.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

746
00:36:33.781 --> 00:36:36.690
<v Speaker 2>and at the time I never read the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought this had to be.</v>

747
00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:39.400
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be vilified for,</v>

748
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.500
<v Speaker 4>for that obs and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's been vilified ever since then,</v>

749
00:36:42.501 --> 00:36:47.501
<v Speaker 4>ever since I've ignored him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He need deep platformed and assaulted </v>

750
00:36:47.501 --> 00:36:48.140
<v Speaker 4>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's what happened.</v>

751
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.300
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he went to Middlebury to give a talk,</v>

752
00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 some odd years,</v>

753
00:36:52.851 --> 00:36:55.010
<v Speaker 4>25 years after he wrote this book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

754
00:36:55.011 --> 00:36:56.840
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's also listed by the southern poverty</v>

755
00:36:56.841 --> 00:37:01.841
<v Speaker 4>law center and so that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's what contributed to the d </v>

756
00:37:01.841 --> 00:37:03.770
<v Speaker 4>platforming and the violent protest </v>
<v Speaker 4>against him at Middlebury.</v>

757
00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:09.040
<v Speaker 4>What's crazy is the whole thing is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>propaganda for the superiority of the </v>

758
00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.060
<v Speaker 4>Asian race and everyone's going to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they,</v>

759
00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:14.970
<v Speaker 4>we'll talk about white supremacy and far</v>
<v Speaker 4>and above.</v>

760
00:37:14.971 --> 00:37:19.971
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's basically what his book proved </v>

761
00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:22.301
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're suing Harvard now there's a </v>

762
00:37:22.301 --> 00:37:24.580
<v Speaker 4>group of Asian students that are suing </v>
<v Speaker 4>Harvard because they're discriminated </v>

763
00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.870
<v Speaker 4>against because they're required to have</v>
<v Speaker 4>higher scores because they're assumed to</v>

764
00:37:26.871 --> 00:37:27.530
<v Speaker 4>be smarter.</v>

765
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:32.650
<v Speaker 4>So the standards for Asian students </v>
<v Speaker 4>entering into Harvard is higher than </v>

766
00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:32.650
<v Speaker 4>white people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

767
00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.310
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

768
00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:36.940
<v Speaker 4>Asian privilege has a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

769
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:40.490
<v Speaker 4>Your grandfather was working on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>railroads in California as an indentured</v>

770
00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:43.100
<v Speaker 4>servant and all by privileged trickled </v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

771
00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:46.770
<v Speaker 4>There's obviously a lot of factors that </v>
<v Speaker 4>lead to icu to,</v>

772
00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:48.710
<v Speaker 4>to hire cute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to ignore what those are,</v>

773
00:37:48.711 --> 00:37:52.590
<v Speaker 4>to ignore it completely to ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

774
00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:57.610
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only ideology and this idea that you </v>

775
00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:00.221
<v Speaker 4>cannot look at statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you cannot look at facts and in your </v>

776
00:38:00.221 --> 00:38:01.760
<v Speaker 4>conversation with Ezra Charles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sort of or as reclined rather.</v>

777
00:38:01.761 --> 00:38:06.761
<v Speaker 4>That's what I got is that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is an ideological issue and that </v>

778
00:38:06.761 --> 00:38:07.650
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

779
00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.790
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like an impossible subject </v>
<v Speaker 4>to breach,</v>

780
00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:16.090
<v Speaker 4>like you can't even discuss the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that certain races demonstrate low Iq </v>

781
00:38:17.301 --> 00:38:22.301
<v Speaker 4>and then let's look at what could be the</v>
<v Speaker 4>cost of those even discussing that </v>

782
00:38:22.301 --> 00:38:27.010
<v Speaker 4>somehow or another is so inherently </v>
<v Speaker 4>racist that it must be ignored or it </v>

783
00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:30.571
<v Speaker 4>must be silenced and that you must first</v>
<v Speaker 4>concentrate on all the various </v>

784
00:38:30.571 --> 00:38:33.440
<v Speaker 4>injustices that have been done to those </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who have this lower Iq.</v>

785
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:38.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well let me just take a couple minutes </v>

786
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:38.500
<v Speaker 4>to close</v>

787
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.040
<v Speaker 2>the various doors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take owl that are now a jar based on </v>

788
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.340
<v Speaker 2>what we've said on your holiday and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get so.</v>

789
00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.280
<v Speaker 2>So we'll just take a little more </v>
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>

790
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:46.150
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

791
00:38:46.151 --> 00:38:51.151
<v Speaker 2>Charles Murray went to Middlebury </v>
<v Speaker 2>College and was d platform and he was </v>

792
00:38:51.151 --> 00:38:54.121
<v Speaker 2>not only the platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the usual the platform and with the </v>

793
00:38:54.121 --> 00:38:56.641
<v Speaker 2>students turning their back to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaker and shouting and not let </v>

794
00:38:56.641 --> 00:38:58.480
<v Speaker 2>anything happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the professor who invited him,</v>

795
00:38:58.481 --> 00:39:01.300
<v Speaker 2>who is a liberal professor who wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially debate him,</v>

796
00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:04.030
<v Speaker 2>he wants to act when they're leaving the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hall,</v>

797
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.900
<v Speaker 2>they both get physically attacked by a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a crowd of students.</v>

798
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.820
<v Speaker 2>Charles was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was not hurt.</v>

799
00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:15.450
<v Speaker 2>His host,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a female professor got a concussion and </v>

800
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:19.411
<v Speaker 2>a neck injury that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that still persist and this now more </v>

801
00:39:19.411 --> 00:39:19.411
<v Speaker 2>than a year later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

802
00:39:19.411 --> 00:39:20.230
<v Speaker 2>Shit that she was actually a registered </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat by this.</v>

803
00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:21.430
<v Speaker 2>No doubt.</v>

804
00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:26.490
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're driving out in an suv where </v>

805
00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:29.100
<v Speaker 2>that gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean someone pulls a stop sign out of </v>

806
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.040
<v Speaker 2>the sidewalk and I still got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>concrete ball on the end of it and this </v>

807
00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.580
<v Speaker 2>suv gets smashed with this concrete laid</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stop sign.</v>

808
00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is happening at one of the most </v>

809
00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.410
<v Speaker 2>liberal privileged colleges on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nuts.</v>

810
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:46.680
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the thing that put Marie on my </v>

811
00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.591
<v Speaker 2>radar after all these many years of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>ignoring him and I had actually I felt </v>

812
00:39:49.591 --> 00:39:53.200
<v Speaker 2>guilty because I had declined to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of at least one project because his</v>

813
00:39:53.201 --> 00:39:54.520
<v Speaker 2>name was attached,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

814
00:39:54.521 --> 00:39:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Because I just thought that this guy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>radioactive.</v>

815
00:39:56.231 --> 00:39:58.720
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got some white supremacist agenda.</v>

816
00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.550
<v Speaker 2>I had believed the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

817
00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:02.230
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lies about him.</v>

818
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I saw this and I thought,</v>

819
00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:09.361
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well maybe he is the canary in the coal </v>

820
00:40:09.361 --> 00:40:11.221
<v Speaker 2>mine or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or certainly one of the canaries in the </v>

821
00:40:11.221 --> 00:40:11.221
<v Speaker 2>coal mine that I had ignored where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>

822
00:40:11.221 --> 00:40:15.820
<v Speaker 2>there's certain topics are considered so</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically fraught that you cannot </v>

823
00:40:16.301 --> 00:40:18.280
<v Speaker 2>discuss them no matter what is true.</v>

824
00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Like this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a,</v>

825
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:24.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has to be a firewall between your </v>

826
00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.770
<v Speaker 2>conversation about reality and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of facts.</v>

827
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

828
00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:35.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said he's been suffering from having </v>

829
00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.130
<v Speaker 2>transgress that boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I had him on the,</v>

830
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:41.150
<v Speaker 2>on the podcast a being fairly agnostic </v>
<v Speaker 2>about his,</v>

831
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:46.210
<v Speaker 2>his actual social policy commitments and</v>
<v Speaker 2>his political concerns.</v>

832
00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:48.740
<v Speaker 2>And just wanting to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

833
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:54.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the facts and so far as we touch them </v>

834
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.470
<v Speaker 2>lightly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had zero interest in intelligence,</v>

835
00:40:54.471 --> 00:40:59.470
<v Speaker 2>a as measured by Iq a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although it's an interesting subject,</v>

836
00:40:59.471 --> 00:41:00.060
<v Speaker 2>but I hadn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

837
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:05.100
<v Speaker 2>hadn't spent much time focused on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I had a truly zero interest in </v>

838
00:41:05.771 --> 00:41:09.880
<v Speaker 2>establishing differences between </v>
<v Speaker 2>populations with respect to intelligence</v>

839
00:41:09.881 --> 00:41:12.970
<v Speaker 2>or anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I see what's coming.</v>

840
00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:17.971
<v Speaker 2>I see the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the more we understand ourselves </v>

841
00:41:17.971 --> 00:41:21.660
<v Speaker 2>genetically and environmentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more we will if we go looking or </v>

842
00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.831
<v Speaker 2>even if we're not looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will discover differences between </v>

843
00:41:25.831 --> 00:41:25.831
<v Speaker 2>groups.</v>

844
00:41:25.831 --> 00:41:29.790
<v Speaker 2>And the end game for us as a species is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not to deny that those differences exist</v>

845
00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:35.521
<v Speaker 2>or could possibly exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too deny that they have real </v>

846
00:41:35.751 --> 00:41:37.510
<v Speaker 2>political implication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean with the,</v>

847
00:41:37.511 --> 00:41:42.511
<v Speaker 2>the political employ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the political framework we need is a </v>

848
00:41:42.511 --> 00:41:45.701
<v Speaker 2>commitment to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to equality across the board and a </v>

849
00:41:45.701 --> 00:41:47.870
<v Speaker 2>commitment to treating individuals as </v>
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>

850
00:41:47.871 --> 00:41:52.871
<v Speaker 2>There's nobody who's the average of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>population is meaningless with respect </v>

851
00:41:53.421 --> 00:41:58.421
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that will always be so and I'm and </v>

852
00:41:58.881 --> 00:41:59.570
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

853
00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.980
<v Speaker 2>whatever diversity of talents there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>statistically in various populations,</v>

854
00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:09.460
<v Speaker 2>we want societies that simply don't care</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically about that.</v>

855
00:42:11.511 --> 00:42:16.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not what it's our political </v>

856
00:42:17.901 --> 00:42:22.901
<v Speaker 2>tolerance of one another and supportive </v>
<v Speaker 2>of one another is not predicated on </v>

857
00:42:23.391 --> 00:42:27.650
<v Speaker 2>denying individual differences or even </v>
<v Speaker 2>statistical differences across groups.</v>

858
00:42:27.651 --> 00:42:31.700
<v Speaker 2>It can't be because we know that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are people walking around like a,</v>

859
00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:37.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elon musk who gets out of bed every </v>

860
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:37.280
<v Speaker 2>morning and does the work of like 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

861
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people who just are struggling to </v>

862
00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:46.061
<v Speaker 2>work at starbucks and hold down a job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And our political system,</v>

863
00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:52.880
<v Speaker 2>we don't say one person is more valuable</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically and socially than another,</v>

864
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:55.690
<v Speaker 2>even though one person is capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing massive things that,</v>

865
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:56.620
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

866
00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:57.050
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

867
00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.580
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most other people aren't.</v>

868
00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:04.210
<v Speaker 2>It's when it comes time to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to write laws and create institutions </v>

869
00:43:04.641 --> 00:43:07.520
<v Speaker 2>that protect that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that support human flourishing.</v>

870
00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.360
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to engineer times that raise all</v>

871
00:43:11.361 --> 00:43:12.290
<v Speaker 2>the boats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

872
00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:12.800
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

873
00:43:12.801 --> 00:43:17.801
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're legitimate debates about the </v>

874
00:43:17.801 --> 00:43:20.621
<v Speaker 2>social policies that will do that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're legitimate debates about facts </v>

875
00:43:20.621 --> 00:43:22.650
<v Speaker 2>so we can debate scientific fact and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

876
00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:24.620
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the results of,</v>

877
00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychometric testing or,</v>

878
00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:30.560
<v Speaker 2>or behavioral genetics that are relevant</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this question of intelligence,</v>

879
00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:35.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have a good faith debate about </v>

880
00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:35.920
<v Speaker 2>the data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we can have a good faith debate</v>

881
00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.850
<v Speaker 2>about social policy that should follow </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the data.</v>

882
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:43.210
<v Speaker 2>But what's happening on the left now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>on either at either of those two tiers </v>

883
00:43:44.421 --> 00:43:49.421
<v Speaker 2>of conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are just straight up allegations </v>

884
00:43:49.421 --> 00:43:49.421
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

885
00:43:49.421 --> 00:43:52.300
<v Speaker 2>of racism that hits you the moment you </v>
<v Speaker 2>touch certain certain.</v>

886
00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:52.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

887
00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:53.660
<v Speaker 3>Can I say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

888
00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:55.100
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what he's just summarize that.</v>

889
00:43:55.101 --> 00:44:00.101
<v Speaker 3>And what I've heard sounds to me as </v>
<v Speaker 3>being more humane than the implications </v>

890
00:44:03.141 --> 00:44:05.390
<v Speaker 3>of the argument that the left who were </v>
<v Speaker 3>opposing will.</v>

891
00:44:05.391 --> 00:44:07.250
<v Speaker 3>Sam has just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

892
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.760
<v Speaker 3>because if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the implications of their argument would</v>

893
00:44:10.761 --> 00:44:15.761
<v Speaker 3>be there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want to deny the facts because </v>

894
00:44:15.761 --> 00:44:15.761
<v Speaker 3>they're scared that those facts</v>

895
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:16.690
<v Speaker 2>word</v>

896
00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:22.860
<v Speaker 3>from which there would be derived a </v>
<v Speaker 3>policy that would reflect those facts </v>

897
00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:25.720
<v Speaker 3>and otherwise in their minds they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>marrying those two.</v>

898
00:44:25.721 --> 00:44:30.721
<v Speaker 3>They are marrying the notion that if in </v>
<v Speaker 3>statistical observance there are </v>

899
00:44:30.721 --> 00:44:31.890
<v Speaker 3>variances in Iq between groups</v>

900
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.040
<v Speaker 4>in their minds that means the policy </v>
<v Speaker 4>should follow from that,</v>

901
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:38.640
<v Speaker 4>so it's why they're resisting what he </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying.</v>

902
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:44.300
<v Speaker 4>Whereas what he's saying is there is no </v>
<v Speaker 4>connection between what the policy </v>

903
00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.421
<v Speaker 4>should be and what the facts may be </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of the kind of world we want to </v>

904
00:44:47.421 --> 00:44:50.601
<v Speaker 4>live in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a should aspire to equality regardless </v>

905
00:44:50.601 --> 00:44:53.661
<v Speaker 4>of what the science is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because one is policy and one is </v>

906
00:44:53.661 --> 00:44:54.240
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I freely agree with you on that,</v>

907
00:44:54.241 --> 00:44:56.610
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think that's necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly what they're saying.</v>

908
00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.170
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what they're saying is,</v>

909
00:44:58.171 --> 00:45:03.171
<v Speaker 4>and what they're doing is they almost </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel so guilty that any discussion </v>

910
00:45:03.171 --> 00:45:06.621
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever about race can't be held </v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you repeatedly bring up all the </v>

911
00:45:07.201 --> 00:45:12.201
<v Speaker 4>instances of racism and suppression that</v>
<v Speaker 4>indiscrimination that that group has </v>

912
00:45:12.361 --> 00:45:14.280
<v Speaker 4>suffered from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can't.</v>

913
00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:19.310
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't exist as a statistic island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to bring everything in together</v>

914
00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:25.161
<v Speaker 4>if you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where their protest comes from </v>

915
00:45:25.161 --> 00:45:28.160
<v Speaker 4>and I think that was one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I got from your conversation with </v>

916
00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.590
<v Speaker 4>another client,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't willing to just discuss what's </v>

917
00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:32.210
<v Speaker 4>the implication of these issues and </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely dismissed this.</v>

918
00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:36.180
<v Speaker 4>This fact that Asian people score far </v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

919
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:39.460
<v Speaker 4>There is not a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's not a place for that by,</v>

920
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:44.870
<v Speaker 4>by conceding on the data.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's almost as if they fear that the </v>

921
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:48.801
<v Speaker 4>implication must necessarily follow that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the policy will also be supremacist in </v>

922
00:45:48.801 --> 00:45:49.290
<v Speaker 4>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder.</v>

923
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:54.710
<v Speaker 4>I honestly think what we talked about </v>
<v Speaker 4>before is a big part of it is </v>

924
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:56.700
<v Speaker 4>ideological idea sport and that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>just volleying back.</v>

925
00:45:56.701 --> 00:46:01.701
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're willing to take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the real strengths of </v>

926
00:46:01.701 --> 00:46:04.851
<v Speaker 4>character that you demonstrate in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>debate or any discussion of facts is </v>

927
00:46:04.851 --> 00:46:08.750
<v Speaker 4>when uncomfortable truths rear their </v>
<v Speaker 4>ugly head that are counter to your,</v>

928
00:46:08.751 --> 00:46:10.080
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your personal position.</v>

929
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.600
<v Speaker 4>You have to be able to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got a really good point.</v>

930
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:14.610
<v Speaker 4>You've got a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something to that.</v>

931
00:46:14.611 --> 00:46:15.870
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

932
00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:17.490
<v Speaker 4>This is what my concern would be into.</v>

933
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:19.920
<v Speaker 4>This would be a rational,</v>
<v Speaker 4>real conversation.</v>

934
00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:25.130
<v Speaker 4>This is what I would worry about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you would I'm sure say </v>

935
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:25.130
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would worry about that as well,</v>

936
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.640
<v Speaker 4>and then you would have this sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>discussion.</v>

937
00:46:26.641 --> 00:46:28.830
<v Speaker 4>I didn't get that from that conversation</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had.</v>

938
00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:30.570
<v Speaker 4>I got ping pong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got blah,</v>

939
00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:30.950
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

940
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:31.310
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

941
00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:31.710
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

942
00:46:31.711 --> 00:46:36.711
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got this rallying back and forth of </v>

943
00:46:36.711 --> 00:46:39.591
<v Speaker 4>ideas rather than two human beings not </v>
<v Speaker 4>digging their heels into the sand.</v>

944
00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:44.160
<v Speaker 4>Just trying to look at the ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the statistics and look at these</v>

945
00:46:44.161 --> 00:46:49.161
<v Speaker 4>studies for what they are and look at </v>
<v Speaker 4>Charles Murray and what he's gone </v>

946
00:46:49.161 --> 00:46:52.251
<v Speaker 4>through and should we be able to examine</v>
<v Speaker 4>these statistical anomalies should be </v>

947
00:46:52.261 --> 00:46:57.261
<v Speaker 4>able to examine athletic superiority.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should we be able to examine a </v>

948
00:46:57.261 --> 00:47:00.090
<v Speaker 4>superiority that a Asians show in </v>
<v Speaker 4>mathematics and a lot of the sciences,</v>

949
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:05.240
<v Speaker 4>should we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should we be able to or should we just </v>

950
00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:07.311
<v Speaker 4>dig our heads in this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should we just let things sort </v>

951
00:47:07.311 --> 00:47:07.311
<v Speaker 4>themselves out and quietly ignore all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the reality?</v>

952
00:47:07.311 --> 00:47:08.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why,</v>

953
00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:13.560
<v Speaker 4>so I should say that I am,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I certainly understand people's fear </v>

954
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:19.430
<v Speaker 4>that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that anyone who would go looking for </v>

955
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:20.100
<v Speaker 4>racial difference is very likely </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivated,</v>

956
00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:22.640
<v Speaker 4>motivated by something unethical or </v>
<v Speaker 4>unsavory.</v>

957
00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:23.110
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

958
00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.480
<v Speaker 4>like you could imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

959
00:47:24.481 --> 00:47:29.481
<v Speaker 4>white supremacists being being super </v>
<v Speaker 4>enamored of this</v>

960
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.770
<v Speaker 2>possibility that these data says yes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all.</v>

961
00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:37.830
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they look at the Asian </v>

962
00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:37.830
<v Speaker 2>statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

963
00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:38.800
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

964
00:47:38.801 --> 00:47:42.880
<v Speaker 2>I get that right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there is some things that,</v>

965
00:47:42.881 --> 00:47:45.070
<v Speaker 2>and this was the question I had for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Charles Murray on,</v>

966
00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:46.490
<v Speaker 2>on that podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said like,</v>

967
00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.900
<v Speaker 2>why pay attention to any of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the upside in the,</v>

968
00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:55.260
<v Speaker 2>in the infinity of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of interesting problems we can tackle </v>

969
00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:57.520
<v Speaker 2>scientifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why focus on population differences?</v>

970
00:47:57.970 --> 00:47:58.930
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly,</v>

971
00:47:58.931 --> 00:48:01.630
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get a great answer from him and</v>
<v Speaker 2>his answer his answer,</v>

972
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:04.930
<v Speaker 2>his answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

973
00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:08.470
<v Speaker 2>I think the best version of his answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I agree with,</v>

974
00:48:08.471 --> 00:48:11.920
<v Speaker 2>but still it may not justify certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain uses of attention.</v>

975
00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:17.310
<v Speaker 2>It's just that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this massive bias that I'm </v>

976
00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:24.210
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all working with a blank slate </v>

977
00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:27.660
<v Speaker 2>genetically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and therefore any difference you see </v>

978
00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:29.230
<v Speaker 2>among people is a matter of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of environment.</v>

979
00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:34.530
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then you have people have privileged </v>

980
00:48:34.530 --> 00:48:36.370
<v Speaker 2>environments and people who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>environments that,</v>

981
00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:37.170
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

982
00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:40.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they're massively under resourced.</v>

983
00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:45.780
<v Speaker 2>And so therefore any different </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation at the,</v>

984
00:48:46.431 --> 00:48:51.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the higher echelons of success and </v>

985
00:48:51.431 --> 00:48:52.030
<v Speaker 2>achievement and power in our society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

986
00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:57.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's 13 percent African Americans </v>

987
00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:59.101
<v Speaker 2>in theU ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>s if you look at the top doctors in </v>

988
00:48:59.101 --> 00:49:01.340
<v Speaker 2>hospitals or the top academics or the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

989
00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:03.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Oscar winners or wherever,</v>

990
00:49:03.551 --> 00:49:04.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wherever you want to look for,</v>

991
00:49:04.751 --> 00:49:05.860
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for achievement.</v>

992
00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:11.520
<v Speaker 2>If there are less than 13 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>African Americans in any one of those </v>

993
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:15.901
<v Speaker 2>bins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has to be the result of racism or </v>

994
00:49:15.901 --> 00:49:18.580
<v Speaker 2>systemic racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the left,</v>

995
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:23.020
<v Speaker 2>the left word bias at this moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it is with Jews for antisemitism.</v>

996
00:49:23.021 --> 00:49:24.910
<v Speaker 2>So it is for women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

997
00:49:24.911 --> 00:49:29.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there should be an equal representation </v>

998
00:49:29.911 --> 00:49:30.940
<v Speaker 2>of women in computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>software engineers at Google,</v>

999
00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.750
<v Speaker 2>at any lack of any disparity.</v>

1000
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:39.750
<v Speaker 2>There must be the result of either a </v>
<v Speaker 2>just inequitable resources for kids in </v>

1001
00:49:43.001 --> 00:49:48.001
<v Speaker 2>schools or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or somewhere along the way or I'm kind </v>

1002
00:49:48.071 --> 00:49:49.860
<v Speaker 2>of a selection pressure from the top </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1003
00:49:49.861 --> 00:49:50.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1004
00:49:50.231 --> 00:49:51.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't like women in,</v>

1005
00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:56.580
<v Speaker 2>at Google or blacks at the Oscars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's the.</v>

1006
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.030
<v Speaker 2>So Marie's concern is if you believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1007
00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:04.810
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not exactly what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is,</v>

1008
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:09.960
<v Speaker 2>this is what I believe he thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I could be putting some words into </v>

1009
00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.631
<v Speaker 2>his mouth here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is certainly what many other </v>

1010
00:50:12.631 --> 00:50:12.940
<v Speaker 2>people on his side of the debate thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you believe that you will,</v>

1011
00:50:12.941 --> 00:50:17.941
<v Speaker 2>can consistently find racial bias and </v>
<v Speaker 2>antisemitism and mysogeny where it </v>

1012
00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:20.260
<v Speaker 2>doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1013
00:50:20.261 --> 00:50:21.830
<v Speaker 2>So like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go look,</v>

1014
00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.270
<v Speaker 2>if you go to a hospital and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a real problem there,</v>

1015
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:25.720
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

1016
00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:30.810
<v Speaker 2>the academic departments in the medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools at the best medical schools are </v>

1017
00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:34.451
<v Speaker 2>under massive pressure to find like real</v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity in representation at the </v>

1018
00:50:35.751 --> 00:50:39.020
<v Speaker 2>highest level you need to find a ta head</v>
<v Speaker 2>of cardiology,</v>

1019
00:50:39.021 --> 00:50:40.040
<v Speaker 2>his black right.</v>

1020
00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you and you and the fact that you</v>

1021
00:50:44.001 --> 00:50:48.920
<v Speaker 2>haven't done that is a sign that there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a problem with you and your organization</v>

1022
00:50:48.921 --> 00:50:51.710
<v Speaker 2>and your process of hiring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1023
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:53.870
<v Speaker 2>if it's just the case for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>

1024
00:50:53.871 --> 00:50:58.871
<v Speaker 2>that there are not many candidates </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely have less than 13 percent for </v>

1025
00:50:58.871 --> 00:51:00.800
<v Speaker 2>that field or to take the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1026
00:51:00.801 --> 00:51:03.050
<v Speaker 2>the James Damore memo memo at Google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1027
00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:05.450
<v Speaker 2>If it just is the case that women forget</v>
<v Speaker 2>about this,</v>

1028
00:51:05.451 --> 00:51:08.720
<v Speaker 2>is that this was beyond aptitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This just goes to interest.</v>

1029
00:51:08.721 --> 00:51:11.480
<v Speaker 2>If it's the case that women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

1030
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:17.020
<v Speaker 2>genetic and or environmental are less </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in being software engineers </v>

1031
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:23.230
<v Speaker 2>on average than men are than you then </v>
<v Speaker 2>having 20 percent women's coding </v>

1032
00:51:23.811 --> 00:51:27.080
<v Speaker 2>software at Google is not the price.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not Google's problem,</v>

1033
00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.280
<v Speaker 2>it's just the fact that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>popular,</v>

1034
00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:34.330
<v Speaker 2>what the population interests are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we should no doubt racism still </v>

1035
00:51:34.641 --> 00:51:39.641
<v Speaker 2>exists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt misogyny and sexism still </v>

1036
00:51:39.641 --> 00:51:39.641
<v Speaker 2>exists there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>

1037
00:51:39.641 --> 00:51:41.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's proof of this to be found</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>

1038
00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:46.631
<v Speaker 2>but if to assume an absolute uniformity </v>
<v Speaker 2>of human,</v>

1039
00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:52.290
<v Speaker 2>of interest and aptitude in every </v>
<v Speaker 2>population you could look at is just </v>

1040
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:56.000
<v Speaker 2>scientifically irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be a miracle</v>

1041
00:51:56.050 --> 00:52:01.050
<v Speaker 4>that were the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So at this stage allow me to remind </v>

1042
00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.691
<v Speaker 4>everybody that was sam summarizing what </v>
<v Speaker 4>he thinks Charles Murray was saying as </v>

1043
00:52:03.691 --> 00:52:03.691
<v Speaker 4>opposed to Sam w.</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1044
00:52:03.691 --> 00:52:04.380
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1045
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:07.690
<v Speaker 4>My final point is it's just a true </v>
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>

1046
00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:13.250
<v Speaker 4>Their jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost everything we care about are </v>

1047
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:15.940
<v Speaker 4>massively influenced by genes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not One hundred percent to you though is</v>

1048
00:52:15.941 --> 00:52:18.370
<v Speaker 4>that people have taken your summaries of</v>
<v Speaker 4>other people's stuff,</v>

1049
00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:21.760
<v Speaker 4>but that wasn't even necessarily Charles</v>
<v Speaker 4>Murray's position.</v>

1050
00:52:21.761 --> 00:52:26.761
<v Speaker 4>Your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's your summary of his position in </v>

1051
00:52:26.761 --> 00:52:28.330
<v Speaker 4>relationship to this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This fight against that.</v>

1052
00:52:28.331 --> 00:52:33.331
<v Speaker 4>The thing that I would add and the thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>where there's some daylight between the </v>

1053
00:52:33.331 --> 00:52:33.331
<v Speaker 4>two of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and him</v>

1054
00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:38.340
<v Speaker 2>on my podcast is this is so toxic to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>trafficking in population differences </v>

1055
00:52:45.251 --> 00:52:49.420
<v Speaker 2>with respect to icu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and it's not,</v>

1056
00:52:49.450 --> 00:52:54.450
<v Speaker 2>it's not absolutely clear what social </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies turn on really nailing down </v>

1057
00:52:55.031 --> 00:52:55.780
<v Speaker 2>these differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1058
00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:58.600
<v Speaker 2>so you could go want me to take it even </v>
<v Speaker 2>more toxic as an example.</v>

1059
00:52:58.601 --> 00:53:01.810
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps it's like you could decide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1060
00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Roma in Europe that the Gypsies like</v>

1061
00:53:04.721 --> 00:53:08.620
<v Speaker 2>this is like a very isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beleaguered community.</v>

1062
00:53:08.890 --> 00:53:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Who knows how in bread it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1063
00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:12.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just this is a,</v>

1064
00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:18.180
<v Speaker 2>this is an outlier community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like anyone who's going to want to do </v>

1065
00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:20.530
<v Speaker 2>massive Iq testing on the Roma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>

1066
00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:22.210
<v Speaker 2>what's the point of doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1067
00:53:22.211 --> 00:53:22.740
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1068
00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:26.610
<v Speaker 2>like it seems like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a,</v>

1069
00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:31.970
<v Speaker 2>a kind of political time bomb to devote </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources in that way because we know </v>

1070
00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:38.530
<v Speaker 2>that the policy you want whatever new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever this,</v>

1071
00:53:38.610 --> 00:53:43.610
<v Speaker 2>the main ICU is of any group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the policy you want is to give everyone </v>

1072
00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:47.220
<v Speaker 2>whatever opportunities they can avail </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves of.</v>

1073
00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:52.220
<v Speaker 2>So we want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want people to have the best schools </v>

1074
00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:52.790
<v Speaker 2>they can use and then we'll find people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who need to be in,</v>

1075
00:53:52.791 --> 00:53:55.290
<v Speaker 2>in more remedial schools for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>

1076
00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:56.310
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like,</v>

1077
00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:59.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one population that has 10 times the</v>

1078
00:53:59.611 --> 00:54:02.040
<v Speaker 2>amount of dyslexia than another </v>
<v Speaker 2>population say,</v>

1079
00:54:02.041 --> 00:54:04.830
<v Speaker 2>and they'll be undoubtedly genetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>reasons for that,</v>

1080
00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:09.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there may be environmental reasons for </v>

1081
00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:09.860
<v Speaker 2>that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>

1082
00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:14.330
<v Speaker 2>we need to be able to cater to all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those needs with just this fundamental </v>

1083
00:54:15.631 --> 00:54:20.631
<v Speaker 2>commitment to goodwill and equality </v>
<v Speaker 2>without being panicked that we'll find </v>

1084
00:54:20.631 --> 00:54:24.450
<v Speaker 2>stuff that just blows everything up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on the left there,</v>

1085
00:54:24.451 --> 00:54:29.451
<v Speaker 2>there's the sense that the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>move forward toward equality is to lie </v>

1086
00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:35.420
<v Speaker 2>about what is scientifically pause,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plausible and demonize anyone who won't </v>

1087
00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:35.420
<v Speaker 2>lie with you.</v>

1088
00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:42.090
<v Speaker 2>That's the ideological point that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a new thing though,</v>

1089
00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:43.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1090
00:54:43.021 --> 00:54:44.610
<v Speaker 2>relatively speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1091
00:54:44.611 --> 00:54:49.611
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this hard nose stance from the left of </v>

1092
00:54:49.611 --> 00:54:49.611
<v Speaker 2>the equality of outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1093
00:54:49.611 --> 00:54:53.340
<v Speaker 2>and the only reason why there wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>be 50 percent women or 50 percent black,</v>

1094
00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:55.860
<v Speaker 2>50 percent in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just pick any marginalized group.</v>

1095
00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:59.360
<v Speaker 2>The only reason why it wouldn't be even </v>
<v Speaker 2>across the board with all other races is</v>

1096
00:54:59.361 --> 00:55:02.020
<v Speaker 2>because of discrimination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a fairly new stance.</v>

1097
00:55:02.021 --> 00:55:02.580
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were,</v>

1098
00:55:02.581 --> 00:55:07.581
<v Speaker 2>there were moments that were fairly well</v>
<v Speaker 2>publicized that I don't forget when </v>

1099
00:55:07.581 --> 00:55:11.961
<v Speaker 2>Larry Summers got fired from Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Larry Summers was the president of </v>

1100
00:55:11.961 --> 00:55:14.811
<v Speaker 2>Harvard and he's a famous economist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he gave a speech for which she was </v>

1101
00:55:15.181 --> 00:55:16.730
<v Speaker 2>fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1102
00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:18.990
<v Speaker 2>there might be a little more color as to</v>
<v Speaker 2>why he was fired.</v>

1103
00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:23.040
<v Speaker 2>He was fired because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants the wheels started to come off.</v>

1104
00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:28.490
<v Speaker 2>He didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had alienated enough people that he </v>

1105
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:28.490
<v Speaker 2>didn't have friends to kind of prop him </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1106
00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:29.430
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing that pulled the wheels off</v>

1107
00:55:29.431 --> 00:55:33.630
<v Speaker 2>was that he gave a speech and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know there are,</v>

1108
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:39.080
<v Speaker 2>are differences in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the bell curves that describing a </v>

1109
00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.190
<v Speaker 2>mathematical aptitude between men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

1110
00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:46.790
<v Speaker 2>And this explains why there are many </v>
<v Speaker 2>more top flight male mathematicians and </v>

1111
00:55:47.281 --> 00:55:50.370
<v Speaker 2>engineers than women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not that they even,</v>

1112
00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:52.770
<v Speaker 2>it's not that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1113
00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:54.240
<v Speaker 2>the means of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1114
00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:55.000
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1115
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:57.560
<v Speaker 2>of the bell curves are different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1116
00:55:57.561 --> 00:56:02.561
<v Speaker 2>the means could be the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there could be more variant so that </v>

1117
00:56:02.561 --> 00:56:02.720
<v Speaker 2>the tails are thicker in the case of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the mail,</v>

1118
00:56:02.721 --> 00:56:03.600
<v Speaker 2>but bulk herbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so at the,</v>

1119
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:05.330
<v Speaker 2>at the absolute ends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both the,</v>

1120
00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:08.640
<v Speaker 2>the low end and high end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have many more people.</v>

1121
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:10.090
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

1122
00:56:10.091 --> 00:56:13.620
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to ask you what's the in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same size population,</v>

1123
00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:17.670
<v Speaker 2>how many people do you have at the 99 </v>
<v Speaker 2>point nine,</v>

1124
00:56:17.671 --> 00:56:21.540
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine percentile of aptitude in math.</v>

1125
00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Say it could be that you have and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1126
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:29.130
<v Speaker 1>there's a fair amount of data to show </v>
<v Speaker 1>this many more men at the tails than </v>

1127
00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:29.650
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1128
00:56:29.651 --> 00:56:34.651
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's true for grandmasters in </v>

1129
00:56:34.651 --> 00:56:34.651
<v Speaker 1>chess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1130
00:56:34.651 --> 00:56:36.280
<v Speaker 1>It's just this is not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

1131
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:37.960
<v Speaker 1>and it may be true for something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1132
00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:38.940
<v Speaker 1>playing pool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1133
00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:39.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1134
00:56:39.461 --> 00:56:43.150
<v Speaker 1>they're just differences and that may </v>
<v Speaker 1>not be entirely environmental.</v>

1135
00:56:43.151 --> 00:56:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Almost certainly are not entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental.</v>

1136
00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is one,</v>

1137
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:52.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big issue in the world of pool </v>

1138
00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:55.620
<v Speaker 1>men and women play separately and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason physically why they </v>

1139
00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:55.620
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1140
00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:55.620
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a strength game,</v>

1141
00:56:55.620 --> 00:56:58.120
<v Speaker 1>but women are allowed to play in men's </v>
<v Speaker 1>tournaments,</v>

1142
00:56:58.121 --> 00:57:03.121
<v Speaker 1>but they never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Jean Baluchis was a woman who was </v>

1143
00:57:03.121 --> 00:57:06.990
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was like one of the only women ever </v>

1144
00:57:06.990 --> 00:57:09.511
<v Speaker 1>compete and beat men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's like an extreme outlier and this </v>

1145
00:57:09.511 --> 00:57:12.661
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it was in the late </v>

1146
00:57:12.661 --> 00:57:12.661
<v Speaker 1>seventies and eighties.</v>

1147
00:57:12.661 --> 00:57:16.690
<v Speaker 1>And other than that there's been a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>women that have done well in </v>

1148
00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:19.921
<v Speaker 1>tournaments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they come to Major League </v>

1149
00:57:19.921 --> 00:57:20.680
<v Speaker 1>professional pool tournaments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're almost always one by men.</v>

1150
00:57:20.681 --> 00:57:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

1151
00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:24.340
<v Speaker 1>when I say almost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like 99 point nine percent.</v>

1152
00:57:24.341 --> 00:57:27.010
<v Speaker 1>So there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Commonwealth Games have been happening</v>

1153
00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:32.130
<v Speaker 1>as we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just over the last couple of </v>

1154
00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:34.170
<v Speaker 1>weeks and there was a male to female </v>
<v Speaker 1>transgender athlete in the weight </v>

1155
00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:36.760
<v Speaker 1>lifting category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a whole nother ball.</v>

1156
00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Participated in the women's competition </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Commonwealth Games at the time </v>

1157
00:57:43.481 --> 00:57:48.481
<v Speaker 1>of her joining hadn't yet put down a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rule asked to testosterone levels in </v>

1158
00:57:48.481 --> 00:57:53.400
<v Speaker 1>females competing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this male to female transgender </v>

1159
00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:56.290
<v Speaker 1>person qualified in the female games and</v>
<v Speaker 1>was as you'd expect,</v>

1160
00:57:56.650 --> 00:58:01.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm winning in all of the Games and was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the front runner and destined to win the</v>

1161
00:58:02.381 --> 00:58:07.381
<v Speaker 1>competition as a male to female </v>
<v Speaker 1>transgender person and the only reason </v>

1162
00:58:07.381 --> 00:58:11.880
<v Speaker 1>and it would have led to a huge crisis </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Commonwealth Games because there </v>

1163
00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:12.010
<v Speaker 1>was some resistance to this notion.</v>

1164
00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1165
00:58:13.961 --> 00:58:18.961
<v Speaker 1>the questions that arise is this fat men</v>
<v Speaker 1>will naturally with higher levels of </v>

1166
00:58:18.961 --> 00:58:19.060
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example.</v>

1167
00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:24.360
<v Speaker 1>The only reason it didn't lead to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>crunch time and that was a huge scandal </v>

1168
00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:24.360
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1169
00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:28.580
<v Speaker 1>of winning is that she injured herself </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the competition and by sheer </v>

1170
00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:28.900
<v Speaker 1>accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1171
00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:34.020
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can expand on that a little bit </v>

1172
00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:36.031
<v Speaker 1>because I've actually gone through this </v>
<v Speaker 1>extensively because there was a woman </v>

1173
00:58:36.031 --> 00:58:39.691
<v Speaker 1>who was used to be a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was competing in mixed martial arts </v>

1174
00:58:39.691 --> 00:58:40.480
<v Speaker 1>against women and just beating the shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of them.</v>

1175
00:58:40.481 --> 00:58:44.710
<v Speaker 1>And I was saying that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a mistake and that you're.</v>

1176
00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:49.740
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at whether someone should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be legally able to identify as a woman </v>

1177
00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.040
<v Speaker 1>portray themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A woman,</v>

1178
00:58:51.041 --> 00:58:51.730
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1179
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Do you have the freedom to become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman in quotes?</v>

1180
00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:56.110
<v Speaker 1>In our society?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1181
00:58:56.111 --> 00:59:01.111
<v Speaker 1>but you can't deny biological nature and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's physiological advantages to the </v>

1182
00:59:01.111 --> 00:59:05.611
<v Speaker 1>male frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's specifically when it comes to </v>

1183
00:59:05.611 --> 00:59:06.310
<v Speaker 1>combat sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my wheelhouse.</v>

1184
00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:11.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand there's a giant difference </v>

1185
00:59:11.370 --> 00:59:14.551
<v Speaker 1>between the amount of power that a man </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a woman can generate and if you're </v>

1186
00:59:14.551 --> 00:59:16.980
<v Speaker 1>telling me that a guy living 30 years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his life as a man that's,</v>

1187
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:20.590
<v Speaker 1>that's essentially like a woman being on</v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids for 30 years.</v>

1188
00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:22.130
<v Speaker 1>Then getting off and</v>

1189
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:27.130
<v Speaker 4>then having regular women being forced </v>
<v Speaker 4>to compete with her and try to pretend </v>

1190
00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:28.640
<v Speaker 4>this a level playing field.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is not.</v>

1191
00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:30.620
<v Speaker 4>There's a difference in the shape of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>hips,</v>

1192
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:32.750
<v Speaker 4>the size of the shoulder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the density of the bones,</v>

1193
00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:37.970
<v Speaker 4>the size of the fists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a giant factor in your ability to</v>

1194
00:59:37.971 --> 00:59:40.340
<v Speaker 4>generate power is the size of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>fists.</v>

1195
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:42.680
<v Speaker 4>It's also an ethical problem and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not just competition.</v>

1196
00:59:42.681 --> 00:59:46.310
<v Speaker 4>Here is he have girls getting beaten up </v>
<v Speaker 4>by someone who used to be a man.</v>

1197
00:59:46.311 --> 00:59:51.311
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people came down on me harder than </v>

1198
00:59:51.311 --> 00:59:52.610
<v Speaker 4>anything that I've ever stood up for in </v>
<v Speaker 4>my life,</v>

1199
00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:55.190
<v Speaker 4>never in my life do I think there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be a situation where I said,</v>

1200
00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:56.540
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that guy should be able to</v>

1201
00:59:56.541 --> 00:59:58.400
<v Speaker 4>get his penis removed and beat the shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of women,</v>

1202
00:59:58.700 --> 01:00:03.490
<v Speaker 4>and then people like you're out of line,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's the summary of this.</v>

1203
01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:06.050
<v Speaker 4>That's literally what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a conversation that I had with a</v>

1204
01:00:06.051 --> 01:00:10.010
<v Speaker 4>woman online as well during this whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1205
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:15.670
<v Speaker 4>She said she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this person who had turned into a woman </v>

1206
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:17.750
<v Speaker 4>has always been a woman and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she was a man for 30 years.</v>

1207
01:00:17.751 --> 01:00:18.170
<v Speaker 4>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1208
01:00:18.171 --> 01:00:19.430
<v Speaker 4>she's always been a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1209
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:24.560
<v Speaker 4>even when she had sex with a woman and </v>
<v Speaker 4>fathered a kid and she says,</v>

1210
01:00:24.561 --> 01:00:26.060
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even then I go,</v>

1211
01:00:26.061 --> 01:00:31.061
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're done because you're just talking </v>

1212
01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:31.061
<v Speaker 4>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is ideology,</v>

1213
01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:32.710
<v Speaker 4>ideology cover exact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The front says they are just that.</v>

1214
01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:37.750
<v Speaker 4>She had a male physique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This person who was arguing with me </v>

1215
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:41.480
<v Speaker 4>wants to claim this moral high ground of</v>
<v Speaker 4>being the most progressive and they're </v>

1216
01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:46.001
<v Speaker 4>always looking to step on top of anybody</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's less progressive than than and </v>

1217
01:00:46.001 --> 01:00:49.190
<v Speaker 4>complaint and proclaim superiority,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is the ideological sport.</v>

1218
01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.970
<v Speaker 4>This is the idea sport that you see with</v>
<v Speaker 4>what people are playing.</v>

1219
01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:55.570
<v Speaker 4>Ping Pong with our ideas and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>listening you.</v>

1220
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:59.500
<v Speaker 4>You need to listen to experts in when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>

1221
01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:01.040
<v Speaker 4>Especially when you're talk about </v>
<v Speaker 4>martial arts,</v>

1222
01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:06.600
<v Speaker 4>there's a the the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The difference is so profound and the </v>

1223
01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.151
<v Speaker 4>results are so critical because you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about a sport where the </v>

1224
01:01:10.151 --> 01:01:12.170
<v Speaker 4>objective goal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the goal is clear.</v>

1225
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:14.900
<v Speaker 4>It's very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Beat the fuck out of the other person in</v>

1226
01:01:14.901 --> 01:01:19.901
<v Speaker 4>front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so anything that would give you an </v>

1227
01:01:19.901 --> 01:01:22.331
<v Speaker 4>advantage in beating the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that person should be really looked at </v>

1228
01:01:22.331 --> 01:01:25.871
<v Speaker 4>very carefully and not thrown through </v>
<v Speaker 4>the lens of this progressive ideological</v>

1229
01:01:25.941 --> 01:01:28.910
<v Speaker 4>filter that we're going through right </v>
<v Speaker 4>now because that's what it is.</v>

1230
01:01:28.911 --> 01:01:32.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's how people are looking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and it's with weightlifting as well.</v>

1231
01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:36.350
<v Speaker 4>When transgendered athletes going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>weightlifting competitions,</v>

1232
01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:41.300
<v Speaker 4>the male to female transgender athletes </v>
<v Speaker 4>are overwhelmingly dominant.</v>

1233
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:42.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this,</v>

1234
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:44.420
<v Speaker 4>is this a coincidence or it's.</v>

1235
01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:49.420
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's someone who had fucking </v>

1236
01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:50.891
<v Speaker 4>testosterone pumping through their </v>
<v Speaker 4>system and n and a y chromosome their </v>

1237
01:01:50.891 --> 01:01:52.040
<v Speaker 4>whole life and now all of a sudden we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to say no.</v>

1238
01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:53.000
<v Speaker 4>She's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's a.</v>

1239
01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:56.030
<v Speaker 4>she's dainty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's got size 14 feet.</v>

1240
01:01:56.420 --> 01:01:59.210
<v Speaker 4>She's got gorilla hands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what in the fuck are we doing?</v>

1241
01:01:59.211 --> 01:02:01.340
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I think as you said earlier,</v>

1242
01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:06.400
<v Speaker 4>it's she is a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for the purposes of competition </v>

1243
01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:06.740
<v Speaker 4>against other women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1244
01:02:06.741 --> 01:02:11.741
<v Speaker 4>legally she's a woman at that stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She goes through that identity </v>

1245
01:02:11.741 --> 01:02:12.020
<v Speaker 4>transition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think we have to recognize it.</v>

1246
01:02:12.021 --> 01:02:17.021
<v Speaker 4>I think even many traditional feminists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm making this point much to the angle </v>

1247
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:20.090
<v Speaker 4>of the Trans community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're hold on you.</v>

1248
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:25.160
<v Speaker 4>What you're doing in this way is </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually we fought so hard and so long </v>

1249
01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.000
<v Speaker 4>for these female spaces where we have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>space of our own and that's people that </v>

1250
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.621
<v Speaker 4>used to be men are coming into those </v>
<v Speaker 4>spaces is actually quite literally </v>

1251
01:02:33.621 --> 01:02:33.830
<v Speaker 4>beating the crap out of us spaces.</v>

1252
01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:39.560
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's in boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's in weight lifting and </v>

1253
01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:39.560
<v Speaker 4>martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are,</v>

1254
01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:45.410
<v Speaker 4>by definition they dominating or this of</v>
<v Speaker 4>course they offer what the reasons </v>

1255
01:02:45.410 --> 01:02:48.291
<v Speaker 4>you've said experts that they're calling</v>
<v Speaker 4>upon or almost all transitioned doctors,</v>

1256
01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:53.631
<v Speaker 4>surgeons or people that have </v>
<v Speaker 4>transitioned themselves when they speak </v>

1257
01:02:53.631 --> 01:02:58.101
<v Speaker 4>to actual board certified </v>
<v Speaker 4>endocrinologist and some of the only do </v>

1258
01:02:58.101 --> 01:03:01.371
<v Speaker 4>it off record,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one of 'em forget her name.</v>

1259
01:03:01.651 --> 01:03:04.980
<v Speaker 4>She was in one of the big mixed martial </v>

1260
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:06.900
<v Speaker 4>Ramona crushed sec,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe is her name.</v>

1261
01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:08.740
<v Speaker 4>She's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1262
01:03:08.790 --> 01:03:13.790
<v Speaker 4>not only does it it it actually doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>this transition like from male to </v>

1263
01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:16.300
<v Speaker 4>female,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're forcing your.</v>

1264
01:03:16.301 --> 01:03:21.301
<v Speaker 4>You're putting estrogen into the system,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so the bone density change that would </v>

1265
01:03:21.301 --> 01:03:25.671
<v Speaker 4>ordinarily take place if you removed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's testicles and stopped the </v>

1266
01:03:25.671 --> 01:03:25.671
<v Speaker 4>distance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the production of testosterone.</v>

1267
01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:31.180
<v Speaker 4>Estrogen preserves bone density,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're actually retaining the male </v>

1268
01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:31.180
<v Speaker 4>bone density.</v>

1269
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:36.230
<v Speaker 4>There's so many problems with this and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and that was one of the other </v>

1270
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.230
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>

1271
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.300
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1272
01:03:36.301 --> 01:03:37.890
<v Speaker 4>the Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Olympics allow it.</v>

1273
01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:40.470
<v Speaker 4>The Olympics are very ideologically </v>
<v Speaker 4>based.</v>

1274
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:42.330
<v Speaker 4>There's not a whole lot of science to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

1275
01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:47.520
<v Speaker 4>This transition thing of allowing male </v>
<v Speaker 4>to female athletes to compete in the </v>

1276
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:52.251
<v Speaker 4>Olympics and there's an extreme amount </v>
<v Speaker 4>of corruption in the Olympics as it is </v>

1277
01:03:52.711 --> 01:03:57.711
<v Speaker 4>with the IOC being in bed with water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world antidoping agency and the way </v>

1278
01:03:57.711 --> 01:04:01.821
<v Speaker 4>they handle this Russian scandal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this Russian scandal that was </v>

1279
01:04:01.821 --> 01:04:02.100
<v Speaker 4>highlighted in that fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 4>documentary,</v>

1280
01:04:02.101 --> 01:04:06.900
<v Speaker 4>icarus like fucking crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Olympics or not to be trusted.</v>

1281
01:04:06.901 --> 01:04:11.901
<v Speaker 4>That is a gigantic multibillion dollar </v>
<v Speaker 4>business where the athletes get paid </v>

1282
01:04:11.901 --> 01:04:15.861
<v Speaker 4>zero money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is inherently corrupt from the top </v>

1283
01:04:15.861 --> 01:04:15.861
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no doubt about it,</v>

1284
01:04:15.861 --> 01:04:20.720
<v Speaker 4>so to to call upon them is to see who </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be competing as a woman fuck off.</v>

1285
01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:22.980
<v Speaker 4>They're not the experts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>

1286
01:04:23.010 --> 01:04:26.190
<v Speaker 4>This is not something that's been </v>
<v Speaker 4>examined and this is coming from someone</v>

1287
01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:31.310
<v Speaker 4>who.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of my jobs is examining and </v>

1288
01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:32.640
<v Speaker 4>commentating on fights.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a big part of what I do.</v>

1289
01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:35.670
<v Speaker 4>I understand fights and I know what it </v>
<v Speaker 4>looks like when a man's beating the shit</v>

1290
01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:40.671
<v Speaker 4>out of a woman and that's what it looked</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when this person was fighting </v>

1291
01:04:40.671 --> 01:04:40.671
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

1292
01:04:40.671 --> 01:04:41.730
<v Speaker 4>There was a massive physical advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>massive,</v>

1293
01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:43.390
<v Speaker 4>not a skill advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the,</v>

1294
01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.300
<v Speaker 4>you mentioned something about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>reaction that you got to that.</v>

1295
01:04:45.301 --> 01:04:46.440
<v Speaker 4>What was the trouble you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>insult?</v>

1296
01:04:46.441 --> 01:04:48.570
<v Speaker 4>People are so mad at me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was just so many.</v>

1297
01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:51.360
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they took my words out of context.</v>

1298
01:04:51.361 --> 01:04:56.361
<v Speaker 4>They quoted all these different gender </v>
<v Speaker 4>transition doctors saying that there's </v>

1299
01:04:57.661 --> 01:05:01.650
<v Speaker 4>no science behind this and the science </v>
<v Speaker 4>behind it being totally fair and totally</v>

1300
01:05:01.651 --> 01:05:02.040
<v Speaker 4>equal.</v>

1301
01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:06.200
<v Speaker 4>It's just not and people know it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone knows live.</v>

1302
01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:11.350
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't put Cris Cyborg against </v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy and give him a run for his </v>

1303
01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:12.180
<v Speaker 4>money the wrong way class or that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other way.</v>

1304
01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:17.450
<v Speaker 4>That's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're dealing with a similar </v>

1305
01:05:17.450 --> 01:05:19.401
<v Speaker 4>situation like that in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you know about the girl </v>

1306
01:05:19.401 --> 01:05:19.401
<v Speaker 4>who was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was born a girl.</v>

1307
01:05:19.401 --> 01:05:23.140
<v Speaker 4>She's transitioning to a boy in high </v>
<v Speaker 4>school taking testosterone,</v>

1308
01:05:23.350 --> 01:05:25.990
<v Speaker 4>but in Texas they only allow her to </v>
<v Speaker 4>compete as a girl,</v>

1309
01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:31.140
<v Speaker 4>so she dominated the Texas state </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling championship two years in a </v>

1310
01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:31.990
<v Speaker 4>row and it's horrific because she's on </v>
<v Speaker 4>steroids.</v>

1311
01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:35.560
<v Speaker 4>She's on testosterone for this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1312
01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.170
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't matter because they're testing </v>
<v Speaker 4>chromosome.</v>

1313
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:40.360
<v Speaker 4>She's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was born a woman,</v>

1314
01:05:40.361 --> 01:05:41.290
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's born a girl.</v>

1315
01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:44.140
<v Speaker 4>So because the fact that she's </v>
<v Speaker 4>transitioning to be a boy,</v>

1316
01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:45.100
<v Speaker 4>they don't give a shit.</v>

1317
01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.780
<v Speaker 4>You're a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to wrestle against men.</v>

1318
01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.310
<v Speaker 4>You're a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to wrestle,</v>

1319
01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:53.340
<v Speaker 4>wrestle against boys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they have allow her under extreme </v>

1320
01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:53.340
<v Speaker 4>protests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's terrible.</v>

1321
01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:54.250
<v Speaker 4>She wants to compete or he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should say,</v>

1322
01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:57.460
<v Speaker 4>wants to compete as a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They won't let him.</v>

1323
01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.630
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1324
01:05:58.631 --> 01:06:00.430
<v Speaker 4>you were born a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to compete as a girl.</v>

1325
01:06:00.431 --> 01:06:04.170
<v Speaker 4>So when he competes everybody booze,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's off.</v>

1326
01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:05.980
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1327
01:06:05.981 --> 01:06:06.260
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1328
01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:09.580
<v Speaker 4>it's really devastating question for you</v>
<v Speaker 4>that way around.</v>

1329
01:06:09.581 --> 01:06:13.060
<v Speaker 4>If it's female to male transition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1330
01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:18.090
<v Speaker 4>somebody that used to be a woman that </v>
<v Speaker 4>transitions to a man and wants to </v>

1331
01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:19.120
<v Speaker 4>compete with the men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have an advantage.</v>

1332
01:06:19.121 --> 01:06:22.120
<v Speaker 4>They don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't allow to disadvantage if they</v>

1333
01:06:22.121 --> 01:06:24.250
<v Speaker 4>win in that context.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've actually done really good.</v>

1334
01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:25.400
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right spot.</v>

1335
01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.680
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>women can beat men.</v>

1336
01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it happens all the time.</v>

1337
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:33.150
<v Speaker 4>At Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's especially in Jujitsu in </v>

1338
01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:33.150
<v Speaker 4>particular because it's such a technique</v>
<v Speaker 4>based art,</v>

1339
01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.840
<v Speaker 4>but it is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's.</v>

1340
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:39.870
<v Speaker 4>There's also a woman named Jermaine </v>
<v Speaker 4>Duran to me who's a worldclass mixed </v>

1341
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:43.411
<v Speaker 4>martial artists whose multiple time </v>
<v Speaker 4>world champion of fought a man and </v>

1342
01:06:43.411 --> 01:06:43.450
<v Speaker 4>knocked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a crazy video.</v>

1343
01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:46.120
<v Speaker 4>She fostered a real man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Them with a straight right.</v>

1344
01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:51.440
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is possible for them to win if their </v>

1345
01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.361
<v Speaker 4>skill level is so far superior that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>overcomes the inherent strength </v>

1346
01:06:54.361 --> 01:06:58.711
<v Speaker 4>advantages,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a woman to male transition would be </v>

1347
01:06:58.711 --> 01:06:59.660
<v Speaker 4>at a severe disadvantage against a </v>
<v Speaker 4>natural man.</v>

1348
01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:03.280
<v Speaker 4>So would you be in that Texas case?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They clearly have it wrong.</v>

1349
01:07:03.370 --> 01:07:06.220
<v Speaker 4>They should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should allow him to to compete with</v>

1350
01:07:06.270 --> 01:07:08.860
<v Speaker 4>this and would you be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas I can.</v>

1351
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:13.950
<v Speaker 4>I think all three of us probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>instinctively would resist the notion </v>

1352
01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:16.771
<v Speaker 4>that a female,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a male to female athlete competes with </v>

1353
01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:18.310
<v Speaker 4>other females because they'd have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>resist that.</v>

1354
01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:23.310
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But would you be for a female to male </v>

1355
01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:23.860
<v Speaker 4>athlete competing with men?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1356
01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:25.200
<v Speaker 4>because I don't think there's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

1357
01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:30.620
<v Speaker 4>there's no advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's the problem and the consent </v>

1358
01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:32.170
<v Speaker 4>is sort of running the other direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There she is continually putting herself</v>

1359
01:07:32.171 --> 01:07:35.680
<v Speaker 4>or he's putting himself in harm's way </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowingly,</v>

1360
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:41.170
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not opposed to a woman fighting </v>
<v Speaker 4>a man if she so chooses like I'm not </v>

1361
01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:45.031
<v Speaker 4>opposed to bull riding if you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not lobbying to get bull riding </v>

1362
01:07:45.031 --> 01:07:49.930
<v Speaker 4>outlawed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you want to be so fucking stupid </v>

1363
01:07:49.930 --> 01:07:50.050
<v Speaker 4>that you climb on top of a 2000 pound </v>
<v Speaker 4>angry animal,</v>

1364
01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:51.540
<v Speaker 4>go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1365
01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:52.810
<v Speaker 4>maybe you should be able to do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want.</v>

1366
01:07:52.811 --> 01:07:55.570
<v Speaker 4>I think you should be able to jump out a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fairly good aeros airplanes.</v>

1367
01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:57.100
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to parachute,</v>

1368
01:07:57.101 --> 01:07:58.750
<v Speaker 4>you should be able to risk your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Parachuting.</v>

1369
01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:04.470
<v Speaker 4>The difference lies in just massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>advantages and that there's a massive </v>

1370
01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:06.370
<v Speaker 4>advantage in transitioning from male to </v>
<v Speaker 4>female,</v>

1371
01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:08.770
<v Speaker 4>female to male.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the other problem.</v>

1372
01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.020
<v Speaker 4>Female to male.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to take testosterone.</v>

1373
01:08:11.021 --> 01:08:13.570
<v Speaker 4>You can't legally take testosterone and </v>
<v Speaker 4>compete.</v>

1374
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.690
<v Speaker 4>It's been a giant in mixed martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 4>because for the longest time there was a</v>

1375
01:08:17.691 --> 01:08:22.691
<v Speaker 4>loophole and the loophole was </v>
<v Speaker 4>testosterone therapy and they were </v>

1376
01:08:22.691 --> 01:08:25.811
<v Speaker 4>allowing testosterone replacement </v>
<v Speaker 4>therapy for male athletes that were </v>

1377
01:08:25.811 --> 01:08:27.740
<v Speaker 4>either older or it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a.</v>

1378
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:32.510
<v Speaker 4>It was a symptom of having pituitary </v>
<v Speaker 4>gland damage,</v>

1379
01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:34.820
<v Speaker 4>which comes from head trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which come,</v>

1380
01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:37.250
<v Speaker 4>which means really essentially your </v>
<v Speaker 4>career should be over,</v>

1381
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:40.130
<v Speaker 4>your body's not producing hormones </v>
<v Speaker 4>correctly,</v>

1382
01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:44.030
<v Speaker 4>and that's a very common issue with </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that have been in war.</v>

1383
01:08:44.031 --> 01:08:46.060
<v Speaker 4>People that have been blown up by an </v>
<v Speaker 4>IED,</v>

1384
01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:51.100
<v Speaker 4>people that had been hit a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even soccer players a lot of times show </v>

1385
01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:55.440
<v Speaker 4>a diminished levels of testosterone and </v>
<v Speaker 4>growth hormone because of pituitary </v>

1386
01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:56.810
<v Speaker 4>gland damage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you wouldn't even allow that.</v>

1387
01:08:56.811 --> 01:09:01.811
<v Speaker 4>So a female to male would be in a whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>nother problem in combat sports because </v>

1388
01:09:01.811 --> 01:09:04.130
<v Speaker 4>it's not legal for you to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>testosterone and compete</v>

1389
01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:05.970
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1390
01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:11.040
<v Speaker 2>to bring this full circle back to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting at the pool destroy to destroy </v>

1391
01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:14.451
<v Speaker 2>my vacation on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how long did you spend working on </v>

1392
01:09:14.451 --> 01:09:14.451
<v Speaker 2>this article?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>

1393
01:09:14.451 --> 01:09:14.900
<v Speaker 2>this was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was like,</v>

1394
01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:17.810
<v Speaker 2>I must have hated you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much was she mad?</v>

1395
01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was kind of the perfect storm,</v>

1396
01:09:20.941 --> 01:09:25.941
<v Speaker 2>but there were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were a few things that relieved </v>

1397
01:09:25.941 --> 01:09:26.070
<v Speaker 2>the pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is there was another family from our</v>

1398
01:09:26.071 --> 01:09:26.880
<v Speaker 2>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're like,</v>

1399
01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.790
<v Speaker 2>my daughter had a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another couple.</v>

1400
01:09:29.850 --> 01:09:34.850
<v Speaker 2>That step that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that my wife could socialize with and </v>

1401
01:09:34.850 --> 01:09:37.910
<v Speaker 2>having another couple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're forced me to sort of put on my </v>

1402
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:38.620
<v Speaker 2>social face at dinner and it.</v>

1403
01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:39.420
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1404
01:09:39.421 --> 01:09:40.520
<v Speaker 4>it's not cheating to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1405
01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:43.080
<v Speaker 4>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's actually not that feeling.</v>

1406
01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:48.120
<v Speaker 4>It's horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not mean to say it</v>

1407
01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:51.550
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's putting on your social phase.</v>

1408
01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:54.160
<v Speaker 2>It actually changes your psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like if you have,</v>

1409
01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:59.190
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have to drop your problem in </v>

1410
01:09:59.190 --> 01:09:59.190
<v Speaker 2>order to be a normal sane person with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people you don't know all that well,</v>

1411
01:09:59.350 --> 01:10:01.480
<v Speaker 2>you're actually a happier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more normal person.</v>

1412
01:10:01.770 --> 01:10:06.770
<v Speaker 2>If it had just been me and my wife had </v>
<v Speaker 2>dinner while I'm dealing with this blow </v>

1413
01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:06.770
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1414
01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:10.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just never would have the cloud </v>

1415
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.430
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have left.</v>

1416
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.430
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1417
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.840
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1418
01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:14.080
<v Speaker 2>I was trying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying not to engage.</v>

1419
01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:17.210
<v Speaker 2>And so I didn't want to have to write </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything new to deal with this.</v>

1420
01:10:17.290 --> 01:10:21.310
<v Speaker 2>This is what I viewed as just an </v>
<v Speaker 2>egregious attack on,</v>

1421
01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:24.970
<v Speaker 2>on my intellectual and moral integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1422
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:28.170
<v Speaker 2>and so when I saw this article from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Klein,</v>

1423
01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:33.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized I had this email exchange </v>

1424
01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:33.800
<v Speaker 2>with him at the end of which I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1425
01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.340
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you continue to slander me,</v>

1426
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:40.090
<v Speaker 2>this is the head like a year previously </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there had been released,</v>

1427
01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I release this so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I said,</v>

1428
01:10:43.481 --> 01:10:44.500
<v Speaker 2>but I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of this exchange,</v>

1429
01:10:44.501 --> 01:10:49.501
<v Speaker 2>if you continue to slander me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you misrepresent the reasons why </v>

1430
01:10:49.501 --> 01:10:52.531
<v Speaker 2>we didn't do a podcast because we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had had talked publicly about maybe </v>

1431
01:10:52.531 --> 01:10:54.610
<v Speaker 2>sorting this out on a podcast a year </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

1432
01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:56.990
<v Speaker 2>But I found the exchange with him by </v>
<v Speaker 2>email.</v>

1433
01:10:56.991 --> 01:11:00.940
<v Speaker 2>So in such bad faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found him so evasive and dishonest.</v>

1434
01:11:00.941 --> 01:11:05.941
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just plain ideological pingpong as you </v>

1435
01:11:05.941 --> 01:11:08.170
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not actually engaging my points that</v>

1436
01:11:08.171 --> 01:11:08.710
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1437
01:11:08.711 --> 01:11:13.711
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you lie about this and you keep </v>

1438
01:11:13.711 --> 01:11:13.711
<v Speaker 2>slandering me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to publish his email.</v>

1439
01:11:13.711 --> 01:11:17.400
<v Speaker 2>I think the world should see how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>operate as a journalist and as an editor</v>

1440
01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:22.890
<v Speaker 2>like he hit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had declined to publish a far more </v>

1441
01:11:22.890 --> 01:11:23.840
<v Speaker 2>mainstream opinion defending me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marie and inbox.</v>

1442
01:11:23.841 --> 01:11:24.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was just,</v>

1443
01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:30.220
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was truly slanderous and misleading </v>

1444
01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:33.261
<v Speaker 2>everything he's published on this topic </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he has a huge platform by which to </v>

1445
01:11:33.261 --> 01:11:33.261
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1446
01:11:33.261 --> 01:11:35.340
<v Speaker 2>which I enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really like box.</v>

1447
01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1448
01:11:35.701 --> 01:11:37.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read vox.</v>

1449
01:11:37.921 --> 01:11:39.360
<v Speaker 2>We pleasure as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is,</v>

1450
01:11:39.710 --> 01:11:43.500
<v Speaker 2>it once you see how the sausage gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>made on many of these things,</v>

1451
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:44.310
<v Speaker 2>but once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once your,</v>

1452
01:11:44.311 --> 01:11:49.311
<v Speaker 2>the news item,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see that there's very little </v>

1453
01:11:49.311 --> 01:11:49.470
<v Speaker 2>journalistic scruple in the background </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1454
01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:51.570
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1455
01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:57.380
<v Speaker 2>I was mad I didn't want to have to spend</v>
<v Speaker 2>my time on vacation writing a retort to </v>

1456
01:11:57.871 --> 01:12:00.120
<v Speaker 2>this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I felt like I had to respond.</v>

1457
01:12:00.121 --> 01:12:01.290
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an illusion.</v>

1458
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:05.160
<v Speaker 2>It was like a sheer confection of </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at twitter.</v>

1459
01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:10.190
<v Speaker 2>And if I hadn't been looking at twitter </v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have felt they had to </v>

1460
01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:10.190
<v Speaker 2>respond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1461
01:12:10.190 --> 01:12:13.470
<v Speaker 2>and so I responded in the laziest </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible way,</v>

1462
01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:16.260
<v Speaker 2>which I just published the email </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange because it's already written,</v>

1463
01:12:16.261 --> 01:12:19.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to write anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just hit send essentially.</v>

1464
01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:24.380
<v Speaker 2>And of course the rest of the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know you actually meant to be on </v>

1465
01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.871
<v Speaker 2>vacation right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's no context to them as to </v>

1466
01:12:26.871 --> 01:12:28.290
<v Speaker 2>why you were still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1467
01:12:28.291 --> 01:12:33.291
<v Speaker 2>I massively underestimated the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>work even my own fans would have to do </v>

1468
01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:37.200
<v Speaker 2>to understand why I was so angry and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that email exchange.</v>

1469
01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:42.200
<v Speaker 2>So I came off like the angry bastard in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the email exchange and he came off as </v>

1470
01:12:42.361 --> 01:12:46.140
<v Speaker 2>this just open minded ready to dialogue </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

1471
01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:51.440
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you follow the plot and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw what he had published about me and </v>

1472
01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:56.430
<v Speaker 2>Ann Marie previously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing that has hit is now on the </v>

1473
01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:57.230
<v Speaker 2>hate watch page SPLC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1474
01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:00.280
<v Speaker 2>he was being totally disingenuous and </v>
<v Speaker 2>evasive and just,</v>

1475
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.330
<v Speaker 2>they didn't match to his article did </v>
<v Speaker 2>they not,</v>

1476
01:13:03.331 --> 01:13:07.890
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I just kept getting more tuned up</v>

1477
01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:13.240
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I published this thing not </v>

1478
01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:13.240
<v Speaker 2>realizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

1479
01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:18.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was definitely a mistake to publish </v>

1480
01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:18.440
<v Speaker 2>the email exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just pragmatically not,</v>

1481
01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:21.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was unethical because I</v>

1482
01:13:21.241 --> 01:13:25.260
<v Speaker 2>told him I was going to do it in advance</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he kept kept it up.</v>

1483
01:13:25.290 --> 01:13:28.980
<v Speaker 2>It was just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was totally counterproductive because</v>

1484
01:13:28.981 --> 01:13:31.510
<v Speaker 2>it was his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was far more reasonable people,</v>

1485
01:13:31.770 --> 01:13:33.060
<v Speaker 2>couldn't he original article.</v>

1486
01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like you that do a lot of work </v>

1487
01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:38.440
<v Speaker 2>to understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is he wasn't,</v>

1488
01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:38.440
<v Speaker 2>it was sued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1489
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:41.370
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an appearance of a reason,</v>

1490
01:13:41.371 --> 01:13:42.270
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was not.</v>

1491
01:13:42.271 --> 01:13:45.000
<v Speaker 2>And then we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we finally did this podcast.</v>

1492
01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm a year hence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1493
01:13:48.181 --> 01:13:50.550
<v Speaker 2>this is now my last podcast is now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1494
01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:53.180
<v Speaker 2>two weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1495
01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:58.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was basically as bad as I was </v>

1496
01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:00.621
<v Speaker 2>expecting a and I basic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel that I met the person who I </v>

1497
01:14:00.621 --> 01:14:04.761
<v Speaker 2>thought I was dealing with in the email </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange and he was fundamentally </v>

1498
01:14:04.761 --> 01:14:07.150
<v Speaker 2>unresponsive to any of my points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1499
01:14:07.170 --> 01:14:08.010
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1500
01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 2>just trying to score political points to</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1501
01:14:12.190 --> 01:14:14.620
<v Speaker 2>toward his audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is he has.</v>

1502
01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:16.120
<v Speaker 2>What's that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's many,</v>

1503
01:14:16.121 --> 01:14:21.121
<v Speaker 2>there are many asymmetries here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one crucial one is that he has an </v>

1504
01:14:21.121 --> 01:14:25.711
<v Speaker 2>audience that doesn't care about whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not he's responsive to the thing that</v>

1505
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:30.490
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his opponent or interlocutor just said,</v>

1506
01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:30.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1507
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.700
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not tracking it by that metric.</v>

1508
01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:38.020
<v Speaker 2>They're tracking it by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you making the political points that</v>

1509
01:14:38.021 --> 01:14:39.060
<v Speaker 2>are ongoing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>

1510
01:14:39.061 --> 01:14:42.410
<v Speaker 2>that are massaging that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outraged part of our brains like our go,</v>

1511
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:44.970
<v Speaker 2>do you have your hands on our Amygdala,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1512
01:14:44.971 --> 01:14:46.960
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and are you pushing the right buttons?</v>

1513
01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:52.350
<v Speaker 2>And so he's talking about racism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>white privilege and I'm granting him all</v>

1514
01:14:53.651 --> 01:14:54.460
<v Speaker 2>of that and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1515
01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:58.900
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you why that's not relevant </v>
<v Speaker 2>to my concerns.</v>

1516
01:14:58.901 --> 01:15:03.901
<v Speaker 2>And what happened here with Marie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna I'm everything you're </v>

1517
01:15:03.901 --> 01:15:03.901
<v Speaker 2>going to say about the history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>lynching.</v>

1518
01:15:03.901 --> 01:15:04.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to grant you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1519
01:15:04.451 --> 01:15:05.840
<v Speaker 2>That's not the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>

1520
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.560
<v Speaker 2>There's no daylight between us there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1521
01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:11.530
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an audience that is,</v>

1522
01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:16.120
<v Speaker 2>that care is massively about following </v>
<v Speaker 2>the logic of a conversation.</v>

1523
01:15:16.121 --> 01:15:21.121
<v Speaker 2>If somebody makes a point that is even </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to being good in response to me,</v>

1524
01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:24.280
<v Speaker 2>my audience is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1525
01:15:24.281 --> 01:15:24.850
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam,</v>

1526
01:15:24.851 --> 01:15:26.150
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you going to say to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1527
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:28.650
<v Speaker 2>And if and if I drop that ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1528
01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:30.330
<v Speaker 2>I lose massive points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1529
01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:35.580
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I'm often finding myself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation with people who don't have </v>

1530
01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:36.010
<v Speaker 2>to care about those kinds of audiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1531
01:15:36.011 --> 01:15:41.011
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the one I had one with this </v>

1532
01:15:41.011 --> 01:15:41.140
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the title of the best podcasts ever.</v>

1533
01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:46.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knows his audience does not care </v>

1534
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.470
<v Speaker 2>about him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly.</v>

1535
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Representing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this case,</v>

1536
01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:47.730
<v Speaker 2>the doctor</v>

1537
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:50.340
<v Speaker 3>who was that guy even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean at least Ezra Klein,</v>

1538
01:15:50.341 --> 01:15:51.020
<v Speaker 3>he could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1539
01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:53.690
<v Speaker 3>editor of Vox or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where did you even find that?</v>

1540
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:55.010
<v Speaker 3>On twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 3>On twitter.</v>

1541
01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:58.930
<v Speaker 3>That's again the twitter growth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ruination of podcasts.</v>

1542
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Until this day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know who this bloke is,</v>

1543
01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:02.060
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is.</v>

1544
01:16:02.061 --> 01:16:04.740
<v Speaker 3>Just some crazy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and Nancy.</v>

1545
01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:07.580
<v Speaker 3>What did he call me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was because at one point he was going</v>

1546
01:16:07.581 --> 01:16:11.000
<v Speaker 3>on about me being some form of enabler </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your bigotry and yeah,</v>

1547
01:16:11.001 --> 01:16:15.210
<v Speaker 3>well I mean you're an uncle tom native </v>
<v Speaker 3>informant or whatever it is,</v>

1548
01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:18.140
<v Speaker 3>but I can show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see this is the.</v>

1549
01:16:18.150 --> 01:16:22.010
<v Speaker 3>This is why it's so frustrating because </v>
<v Speaker 3>I have pretty much memorized inside out,</v>

1550
01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:25.910
<v Speaker 3>back to front the Islamist ideological </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative and I could sit here right now</v>

1551
01:16:25.911 --> 01:16:30.080
<v Speaker 3>and play that game with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that game of ping pong without conceding</v>

1552
01:16:30.081 --> 01:16:31.220
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is where,</v>

1553
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:33.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel our conversation went really well</v>

1554
01:16:33.981 --> 01:16:38.981
<v Speaker 3>because it was stripped away from all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>that bullshit and we had a genuine </v>

1555
01:16:38.981 --> 01:16:43.840
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still to this day very easy for me </v>

1556
01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:46.361
<v Speaker 3>to to play the tune of the Islamist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>score those points,</v>

1557
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:52.930
<v Speaker 3>especially because some of what I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>been through school those points and </v>

1558
01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:54.770
<v Speaker 3>just get locked in a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially it's ego,</v>

1559
01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:55.610
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1560
01:16:55.690 --> 01:16:57.620
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not an intellectual conversation.</v>

1561
01:16:57.621 --> 01:16:58.230
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1562
01:16:58.330 --> 01:17:00.200
<v Speaker 3>it's a game of you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

1563
01:17:00.210 --> 01:17:05.210
<v Speaker 3>who is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is basically checking the right </v>

1564
01:17:05.210 --> 01:17:07.421
<v Speaker 3>boxes in their own little confirmation </v>
<v Speaker 3>bias to their own audience and that </v>

1565
01:17:07.421 --> 01:17:09.170
<v Speaker 3>doesn't interest me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's frustrating.</v>

1566
01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 3>You're also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're also</v>

1567
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.740
<v Speaker 1>the best person on the other side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that conversation now.</v>

1568
01:17:12.741 --> 01:17:15.140
<v Speaker 1>So there's a series of videos on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>

1569
01:17:15.141 --> 01:17:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called Merry Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

1570
01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:22.740
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so on youtube you can watch him </v>

1571
01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:23.000
<v Speaker 1>pitted it against people who are playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this game,</v>

1572
01:17:23.001 --> 01:17:25.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamists and jihadists of various sorts</v>

1573
01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:27.950
<v Speaker 1>in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that he,</v>

1574
01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:33.120
<v Speaker 1>Majid is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is meeting them on your interview show </v>

1575
01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.521
<v Speaker 1>is mostly in the UK where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be more benign than they </v>

1576
01:17:35.811 --> 01:17:37.110
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that module is,</v>

1577
01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:42.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding the question that sort of pulls </v>

1578
01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:42.830
<v Speaker 1>back the mask on the theocrat and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hilarious.</v>

1579
01:17:43.090 --> 01:17:46.580
<v Speaker 1>It's very funny that one video that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>publish on your blog.</v>

1580
01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:51.680
<v Speaker 1>I've sent to dozens of my friends that </v>
<v Speaker 1>one video where there's this guy and is </v>

1581
01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:56.550
<v Speaker 1>addressing this enormous group of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's talking about is this radical </v>

1582
01:17:56.550 --> 01:17:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Islam or Islam?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a conference in Norway.</v>

1583
01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.450
<v Speaker 1>That was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1584
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:05.750
<v Speaker 1>just straight up in Islamic jihadist </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing a crowd of seemingly </v>

1585
01:18:05.751 --> 01:18:07.850
<v Speaker 1>mainstream Muslims in Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

1586
01:18:07.851 --> 01:18:09.260
<v Speaker 1>just by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by show of hands,</v>

1587
01:18:09.261 --> 01:18:09.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

1588
01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:13.050
<v Speaker 1>are we extremists if we think apostates </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be killed,</v>

1589
01:18:13.730 --> 01:18:16.140
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing document.</v>

1590
01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In respect to the way they want to treat</v>

1591
01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:21.480
<v Speaker 1>homosexuals apostates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1592
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:26.530
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this Islam or is this radical Islam </v>

1593
01:18:26.530 --> 01:18:28.250
<v Speaker 1>talking of ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blinkering statistical data,</v>

1594
01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:30.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the subject of homosexuality.</v>

1595
01:18:30.411 --> 01:18:34.730
<v Speaker 1>So in the United Kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a poll was done last year asking,</v>

1596
01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:39.310
<v Speaker 1>so there've been two poles gauging </v>
<v Speaker 1>public Muslim attitudes towards gays.</v>

1597
01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first asked how many Muslims in the </v>

1598
01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:47.350
<v Speaker 1>UK find homosexuality is morally </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptable and zero percent.</v>

1599
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:50.150
<v Speaker 1>This is by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by professional polling companies,</v>

1600
01:18:50.151 --> 01:18:52.820
<v Speaker 1>not just some student that's devised a </v>
<v Speaker 1>poll on twitter.</v>

1601
01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:58.240
<v Speaker 1>A professional polling company found </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero percent of British Muslims </v>

1602
01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:01.040
<v Speaker 1>responded to a poll saying that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>found homosexuality morally acceptable.</v>

1603
01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:03.380
<v Speaker 1>And then a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which now last year,</v>

1604
01:19:03.381 --> 01:19:05.870
<v Speaker 1>another poll a was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was conducted.</v>

1605
01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:07.110
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1606
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:12.130
<v Speaker 1>that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ICM poll asking where the British </v>

1607
01:19:12.130 --> 01:19:16.031
<v Speaker 1>Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many British Muslims believe that </v>

1608
01:19:16.031 --> 01:19:16.430
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality should be criminalized or </v>
<v Speaker 1>remain legal.</v>

1609
01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:17.990
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1610
01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:23.320
<v Speaker 1>I think it was roughly 52 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>52 percent if my memory serves me </v>

1611
01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:26.681
<v Speaker 1>correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said of British Muslims said that they </v>

1612
01:19:26.681 --> 01:19:26.681
<v Speaker 1>would wish for homosexuality to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminalized.</v>

1613
01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:31.840
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does criminalization of </v>

1614
01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:33.170
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality mean under shadier and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional Islamic jurisprudence,</v>

1615
01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:38.290
<v Speaker 1>we know that it's punished by death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are these,</v>

1616
01:19:38.331 --> 01:19:41.720
<v Speaker 1>this is scientific data from gauging </v>
<v Speaker 1>know attitudes,</v>

1617
01:19:41.721 --> 01:19:44.270
<v Speaker 1>British Muslim attitudes towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality,</v>

1618
01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:49.630
<v Speaker 1>but the ideological blinkers will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will kick in and refuse to see that </v>

1619
01:19:49.630 --> 01:19:49.800
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these aren't Islamists.</v>

1620
01:19:49.801 --> 01:19:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dialogue with Sam,</v>

1621
01:19:51.141 --> 01:19:56.141
<v Speaker 1>we talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are the Islamists who wants </v>

1622
01:19:56.141 --> 01:19:56.141
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who actively want to take over a country</v>

1623
01:19:56.141 --> 01:19:58.790
<v Speaker 1>and enforce their version of Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's underneath that there's a,</v>

1624
01:19:59.050 --> 01:20:02.330
<v Speaker 1>a softer landing of very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very conservative stroke,</v>

1625
01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:05.900
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist attitudes that </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately have become widespread.</v>

1626
01:20:05.901 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 1>And here is an example of that is that</v>

1627
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:13.010
<v Speaker 3>is being gauged by scientific polling </v>
<v Speaker 3>methodology that tells us there's a </v>

1628
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:14.190
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And unfortunately,</v>

1629
01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:18.720
<v Speaker 3>if one were to speak in this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in Europe,</v>

1630
01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:24.380
<v Speaker 3>one is received by my own political </v>
<v Speaker 3>tribe and that's liberals center left </v>

1631
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:29.750
<v Speaker 3>and further,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one is a met with denial and called a </v>

1632
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:33.861
<v Speaker 3>bigot simply for relaying these facts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A quarter of British Muslims when asked </v>

1633
01:20:35.011 --> 01:20:40.011
<v Speaker 3>about the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo </v>
<v Speaker 3>offices in Paris a quarter said that </v>

1634
01:20:40.681 --> 01:20:45.681
<v Speaker 3>those attacks are justifiable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They sympathize with the attackers as </v>

1635
01:20:45.681 --> 01:20:47.670
<v Speaker 3>opposed to the victims who were the </v>
<v Speaker 3>staff at the Charlie Hebdo offices.</v>

1636
01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:52.730
<v Speaker 3>So this is what led you to be put on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>southern Harvard speaking in these </v>

1637
01:20:54.001 --> 01:20:54.410
<v Speaker 3>terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1638
01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:56.730
<v Speaker 3>and unfortunately it's reporting polling</v>
<v Speaker 3>data.</v>

1639
01:20:56.731 --> 01:21:01.731
<v Speaker 3>And what it does for me is to say this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is why it's so important to address </v>

1640
01:21:01.731 --> 01:21:01.830
<v Speaker 3>these issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have these conversations,</v>

1641
01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:07.490
<v Speaker 3>to try and empower those Muslim voices </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are seeking to challenge this sort </v>

1642
01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:08.320
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these sorts of attitudes and,</v>

1643
01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:09.930
<v Speaker 3>and carve out a space.</v>

1644
01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:10.450
<v Speaker 3>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1645
01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:15.900
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if one can do that with Catholicism in </v>

1646
01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:18.681
<v Speaker 3>Europe and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go through a reformation and end up </v>

1647
01:21:18.681 --> 01:21:18.681
<v Speaker 3>with an enlightenment and end up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>secularism in the West.</v>

1648
01:21:18.681 --> 01:21:23.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I often say is American liberals </v>

1649
01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:25.170
<v Speaker 3>are very happy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenging their own Bible belt and yet</v>

1650
01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:30.171
<v Speaker 3>we have a Koran belt within our </v>
<v Speaker 3>communities and if I'm attempting to </v>

1651
01:21:30.171 --> 01:21:33.981
<v Speaker 3>replicate the equivalent of challenging </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Bible belt within Muslim </v>

1652
01:21:33.981 --> 01:21:35.370
<v Speaker 3>communities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it means addressing these issues and yet</v>

1653
01:21:35.610 --> 01:21:40.050
<v Speaker 3>they grant to themselves the right to </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge the Bible belt within America.</v>

1654
01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:45.380
<v Speaker 3>And yet if we were to challenge what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>call the Koran belt in Europe were </v>

1655
01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:48.120
<v Speaker 3>suddenly called bigots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Islamophobes is this,</v>

1656
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:52.920
<v Speaker 3>is this static has been moving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has it been adjusting and changing?</v>

1657
01:21:52.921 --> 01:21:56.250
<v Speaker 3>Is there any sort of a recognition that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an issue with this?</v>

1658
01:21:56.490 --> 01:22:01.490
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the emergence of Isis really did bring </v>

1659
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:03.270
<v Speaker 3>it to the fore and it really did quiet </v>
<v Speaker 3>and some of the voices.</v>

1660
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:08.270
<v Speaker 3>It also did increase the hysteria from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the far left because they began </v>

1661
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:12.230
<v Speaker 3>panicking thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually we're going to lose this </v>

1662
01:22:12.230 --> 01:22:14.301
<v Speaker 3>debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's where I noticed their </v>

1663
01:22:14.301 --> 01:22:16.021
<v Speaker 3>labeling became even stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the emergence of Isis did wake up a </v>

1664
01:22:16.021 --> 01:22:17.880
<v Speaker 3>lot of people to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the challenges we're facing here.</v>

1665
01:22:17.881 --> 01:22:21.810
<v Speaker 3>Because so many European born and raised</v>
<v Speaker 3>Muslims went over to join isis.</v>

1666
01:22:21.811 --> 01:22:23.490
<v Speaker 3>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about it in this sense,</v>

1667
01:22:23.491 --> 01:22:28.491
<v Speaker 3>the most infamous notorious execution </v>
<v Speaker 3>sell that I think were erroneously </v>

1668
01:22:29.041 --> 01:22:33.000
<v Speaker 3>called the jihadi beetles in the press </v>
<v Speaker 3>because actually it really does,</v>

1669
01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:38.720
<v Speaker 3>it's an insult to the Beatles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a diminishes the true horror </v>

1670
01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:38.720
<v Speaker 3>of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1671
01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.980
<v Speaker 3>they call him jihadi John and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the isis executioners basically that</v>

1672
01:22:40.981 --> 01:22:45.981
<v Speaker 3>entire cell of the media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>face of ics execution cell were all </v>

1673
01:22:46.081 --> 01:22:51.081
<v Speaker 3>British Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that should tell you something that </v>

1674
01:22:51.081 --> 01:22:51.081
<v Speaker 3>we've got the worst terrorist group </v>
<v Speaker 3>educator.</v>

1675
01:22:51.081 --> 01:22:52.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is at university graduate,</v>

1676
01:22:52.141 --> 01:22:57.141
<v Speaker 3>like every variable that the far left </v>
<v Speaker 3>wants to marshal to explain this </v>

1677
01:22:57.141 --> 01:22:59.550
<v Speaker 3>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like lack of educational opportunity,</v>

1678
01:22:59.551 --> 01:23:02.400
<v Speaker 3>lack of economic opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of social integration,</v>

1679
01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:04.070
<v Speaker 3>mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1680
01:23:04.071 --> 01:23:04.590
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

1681
01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.100
<v Speaker 3>you find people</v>

1682
01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:08.240
<v Speaker 2>who had massive opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1683
01:23:08.241 --> 01:23:09.240
<v Speaker 2>it's a bit like you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1684
01:23:09.241 --> 01:23:11.080
<v Speaker 2>you weren't a jihadist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you are an Islamist.</v>

1685
01:23:11.081 --> 01:23:16.081
<v Speaker 2>But let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a person who can basically play </v>

1686
01:23:16.081 --> 01:23:16.081
<v Speaker 2>in a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wanted me here.</v>

1687
01:23:16.081 --> 01:23:16.280
<v Speaker 2>You got to get his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1688
01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:21.300
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's somebody who backed to the </v>

1689
01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:21.300
<v Speaker 2>superman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can run,</v>

1690
01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:21.640
<v Speaker 2>he can run for political office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't been elected yet,</v>

1691
01:23:21.641 --> 01:23:22.210
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1692
01:23:22.211 --> 01:23:23.380
<v Speaker 2>he should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1693
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:26.920
<v Speaker 2>this is the quarterback of the football </v>
<v Speaker 2>team</v>

1694
01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:31.720
<v Speaker 3>in this context is a candidate for </v>
<v Speaker 3>recruitment.</v>

1695
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:33.220
<v Speaker 3>We'll think of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think of it this way.</v>

1696
01:23:33.221 --> 01:23:35.890
<v Speaker 3>We've got the the worst terrorist group </v>
<v Speaker 3>in our lifetime.</v>

1697
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:37.980
<v Speaker 3>It one can reasonably say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is Isis right though?</v>

1698
01:23:38.050 --> 01:23:39.760
<v Speaker 3>The worst terrorist group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in living memory,</v>

1699
01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:45.120
<v Speaker 3>is isis and the worst cell nrcs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the execution cell came from a fully </v>

1700
01:23:46.511 --> 01:23:49.420
<v Speaker 3>developed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for want of a better term,</v>

1701
01:23:49.421 --> 01:23:52.490
<v Speaker 3>first world country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that was Britain and Mohammed.</v>

1702
01:23:52.510 --> 01:23:54.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm was he the leader of that execution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sell,</v>

1703
01:23:54.491 --> 01:23:56.380
<v Speaker 3>graduated from the University of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Westminster,</v>

1704
01:23:56.381 --> 01:24:01.381
<v Speaker 3>was given as a young child was given </v>
<v Speaker 3>political asylum by Britain because his </v>

1705
01:24:01.381 --> 01:24:04.870
<v Speaker 3>family were Kuwaiti and they fled the </v>
<v Speaker 3>invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein,</v>

1706
01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:09.640
<v Speaker 3>the country that the west liberated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he turned against that country.</v>

1707
01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:12.760
<v Speaker 3>So he had every reason to like Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Britain gave my home,</v>

1708
01:24:12.820 --> 01:24:15.610
<v Speaker 3>gave him a actually physically bricks </v>
<v Speaker 3>and mortar house,</v>

1709
01:24:15.611 --> 01:24:18.610
<v Speaker 3>gave his family on social costs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They gave him social housing.</v>

1710
01:24:18.970 --> 01:24:23.970
<v Speaker 3>They educated and he graduated from </v>
<v Speaker 3>university and they liberated his </v>

1711
01:24:23.970 --> 01:24:26.440
<v Speaker 3>father's country from an aggressor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this man turned against this country</v>

1712
01:24:26.441 --> 01:24:28.360
<v Speaker 3>that helped him and his family and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>nation.</v>

1713
01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Was he captured or did he go?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's dead.</v>

1714
01:24:31.170 --> 01:24:34.740
<v Speaker 3>One of them has been captured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's currently being held in Turkey.</v>

1715
01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:38.410
<v Speaker 3>It would be fascinating to listen to his</v>
<v Speaker 3>rationale.</v>

1716
01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that the other one,</v>

1717
01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:42.230
<v Speaker 2>I forgot his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was just interviewing tim.</v>

1718
01:24:42.290 --> 01:24:47.290
<v Speaker 2>Did you don't get a lot out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was interviewed by female Arab </v>

1719
01:24:47.290 --> 01:24:47.850
<v Speaker 2>journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1720
01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.440
<v Speaker 2>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so on.</v>

1721
01:24:50.441 --> 01:24:52.400
<v Speaker 2>And dismissive character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1722
01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1723
01:24:52.830 --> 01:24:54.260
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he refused to talk about March.</v>

1724
01:24:54.261 --> 01:24:54.780
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1725
01:24:54.850 --> 01:24:59.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are accu accusations and </v>

1726
01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:00.050
<v Speaker 2>allegations you're making and I will </v>
<v Speaker 2>wait to trial.</v>

1727
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:02.600
<v Speaker 2>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kind of cut the interview short.</v>

1728
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:04.310
<v Speaker 2>He seemed a little put out that she was.</v>

1729
01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>

1730
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:06.770
<v Speaker 3>So it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking at you now.</v>

1731
01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.440
<v Speaker 3>Imagine she's the interview and she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>asking me questions and I'm looking at</v>

1732
01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:16.760
<v Speaker 2>direction in your direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He literally never laid eyes on her and </v>

1733
01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:19.780
<v Speaker 2>it was bad nlp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so intense and it's such,</v>

1734
01:25:23.941 --> 01:25:24.270
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1735
01:25:24.271 --> 01:25:27.480
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radioactive subject to it's,</v>

1736
01:25:27.650 --> 01:25:32.650
<v Speaker 2>it's just fascinating to watch white </v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal progressives just scamper away </v>

1737
01:25:32.671 --> 01:25:34.170
<v Speaker 2>from this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the flip,</v>

1738
01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:39.210
<v Speaker 2>the flip side of the Isis thing has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>the refugee crisis which has made,</v>

1739
01:25:39.570 --> 01:25:42.750
<v Speaker 2>which has really empowered both extremes</v>
<v Speaker 2>frankly,</v>

1740
01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:45.360
<v Speaker 2>that the far left and the far right so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the far right.</v>

1741
01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:50.880
<v Speaker 2>You are obviously with the wind in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>sails worrying about this influx of </v>

1742
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:54.860
<v Speaker 2>people from the Middle East and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1743
01:25:54.930 --> 01:25:57.020
<v Speaker 2>and beyond North Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1744
01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:02.360
<v Speaker 2>and just the change of culture in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>societies and a lot of these concerns </v>

1745
01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 2>are plausible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because only</v>

1746
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:09.070
<v Speaker 4>the far right and a few other decent </v>
<v Speaker 4>people like Douglas Murray will talk </v>

1747
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:11.330
<v Speaker 4>about the plausible concerns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1748
01:26:11.610 --> 01:26:14.450
<v Speaker 4>the space has just been vacated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you just have the far right,</v>

1749
01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:15.800
<v Speaker 4>far,</v>
<v Speaker 4>far right,</v>

1750
01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:20.801
<v Speaker 4>populous politics being enabled and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have this delusional open borders </v>

1751
01:26:21.081 --> 01:26:22.890
<v Speaker 4>left that won't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1752
01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:26.420
<v Speaker 4>we talked about the problem that I told </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam about this,</v>

1753
01:26:26.421 --> 01:26:28.070
<v Speaker 4>but it bears repeating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1754
01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:33.390
<v Speaker 4>I was having a conversation with someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>as an executive at Youtube and I asked </v>

1755
01:26:33.390 --> 01:26:36.641
<v Speaker 4>them why someone got a community </v>
<v Speaker 4>guideline strike on their account </v>

1756
01:26:36.641 --> 01:26:40.250
<v Speaker 4>because they posted up a video on their </v>
<v Speaker 4>playlist that they enjoyed of Sam Harris</v>

1757
01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:42.950
<v Speaker 4>and Douglas Murray engaged in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

1758
01:26:42.951 --> 01:26:43.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1759
01:26:43.581 --> 01:26:47.090
<v Speaker 4>why would that get you a community </v>
<v Speaker 4>guideline strike in?</v>

1760
01:26:47.091 --> 01:26:48.710
<v Speaker 4>This woman said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's hate speech.</v>

1761
01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:50.560
<v Speaker 4>I got a problem with the last name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maria.</v>

1762
01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.950
<v Speaker 4>Apparently Maria Douglas Murray causing </v>
<v Speaker 4>me problems.</v>

1763
01:26:53.110 --> 01:26:57.080
<v Speaker 4>Somebody worked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was a big executive at Youtube.</v>

1764
01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:58.700
<v Speaker 4>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hate speech.</v>

1765
01:26:58.910 --> 01:27:00.050
<v Speaker 4>And I told her,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1766
01:27:00.370 --> 01:27:01.310
<v Speaker 4>did you listen to it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1767
01:27:01.311 --> 01:27:02.120
<v Speaker 4>you didn't listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1768
01:27:02.121 --> 01:27:07.121
<v Speaker 4>this is stunning that you would just say</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hate speech that you just be so </v>

1769
01:27:07.121 --> 01:27:11.141
<v Speaker 4>dismissive of it so quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she talked to me as if I was her </v>

1770
01:27:11.141 --> 01:27:14.861
<v Speaker 4>employee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I was not allowed to question her </v>

1771
01:27:14.861 --> 01:27:15.110
<v Speaker 4>and she was just going to say what she </v>
<v Speaker 4>said and I was going to shut up.</v>

1772
01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:20.270
<v Speaker 4>And it was a fascinating conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know this is no lie on vacation.</v>

1773
01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:20.720
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was.</v>

1774
01:27:20.721 --> 01:27:24.590
<v Speaker 4>I did a podcast with Douglas and </v>
<v Speaker 4>apparently it got flagged.</v>

1775
01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:29.890
<v Speaker 4>Someone else put it up on their account </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I got flagged as hate speech and so </v>

1776
01:27:29.890 --> 01:27:30.960
<v Speaker 4>strikes you can get your account </v>
<v Speaker 4>removed.</v>

1777
01:27:31.130 --> 01:27:31.510
<v Speaker 4>I've</v>

1778
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:36.510
<v Speaker 3>got a phrase for this and I'd been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd been rallying for it on on social </v>

1779
01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:38.890
<v Speaker 3>media for a couple of months now and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>call it a a digital blind spot.</v>

1780
01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:43.660
<v Speaker 3>There's a cultural bias on social media </v>
<v Speaker 3>where because of,</v>

1781
01:27:43.661 --> 01:27:48.661
<v Speaker 3>and it's intellectually lazy because </v>
<v Speaker 3>because social media is essentially a </v>

1782
01:27:48.661 --> 01:27:48.661
<v Speaker 3>California and invention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1783
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:52.320
<v Speaker 3>and we're in the home state of where </v>
<v Speaker 3>most of this came from it.</v>

1784
01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:57.620
<v Speaker 3>It's got a very Californian based </v>
<v Speaker 3>worldview which cares a lot about white </v>

1785
01:27:57.620 --> 01:28:01.861
<v Speaker 3>supremacy and doesn't care about many </v>
<v Speaker 3>other forms of bigotry that exists out </v>

1786
01:28:01.861 --> 01:28:05.761
<v Speaker 3>there in the rest of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the way is the majority of the </v>

1787
01:28:05.761 --> 01:28:05.761
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So on twitter right now,</v>

1788
01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:08.470
<v Speaker 3>of course there's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Miley Annapolis has been banned.</v>

1789
01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:14.070
<v Speaker 3>Tommy Robinson has been burned as in </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking off now twitter is a private </v>

1790
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:17.301
<v Speaker 3>Tommy Robinson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the former leader of the British </v>

1791
01:28:17.301 --> 01:28:20.460
<v Speaker 3>English Defense League,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was at one time Europe's largest </v>

1792
01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:20.650
<v Speaker 3>anti Muslim street protest group.</v>

1793
01:28:20.830 --> 01:28:25.830
<v Speaker 3>I helped him leave that organization is </v>
<v Speaker 3>still what many views I completely </v>

1794
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:28.861
<v Speaker 3>disagree with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nevertheless he doesn't support or </v>

1795
01:28:28.861 --> 01:28:29.860
<v Speaker 3>nor advocate for terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why was he removed?</v>

1796
01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:31.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so twitter,</v>

1797
01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:33.610
<v Speaker 3>twitter is a private company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can choose to remove whoever it wants</v>

1798
01:28:33.611 --> 01:28:38.611
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'll judge it for his </v>

1799
01:28:38.611 --> 01:28:40.030
<v Speaker 3>inconsistencies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was ostensibly removed for hate </v>

1800
01:28:40.030 --> 01:28:40.030
<v Speaker 3>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as was minor Eunapolis.</v>

1801
01:28:40.030 --> 01:28:43.780
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the point being that still till this day</v>

1802
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:48.870
<v Speaker 3>and before people misquote me and </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely say that I'm now defending </v>

1803
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:51.880
<v Speaker 3>hate speech and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a and their right to speak with</v>

1804
01:28:51.881 --> 01:28:56.881
<v Speaker 3>hateful views on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my actual point that til this </v>

1805
01:28:56.881 --> 01:29:00.031
<v Speaker 3>day did you know that Hezbollah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a known and recognized </v>

1806
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:02.760
<v Speaker 3>terrorist organization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so forget hate speech for a moment,</v>

1807
01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:08.240
<v Speaker 3>a terrorist organization that believes </v>
<v Speaker 3>in actually killing civilians and Hamas,</v>

1808
01:29:08.730 --> 01:29:13.730
<v Speaker 3>a known and recognized terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 3>organization that believes in bombing </v>

1809
01:29:13.730 --> 01:29:15.030
<v Speaker 3>babies on buses as a form of resistance.</v>

1810
01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.990
<v Speaker 3>They still have accounts on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1811
01:29:18.070 --> 01:29:18.460
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1812
01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:19.780
<v Speaker 3>and my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that this is the,</v>

1813
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:24.830
<v Speaker 3>this is the blind spot that I've flagged</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter about this on many an occasion.</v>

1814
01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:28.640
<v Speaker 3>This is the cultural blind spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the digital blind spot that the,</v>

1815
01:29:28.770 --> 01:29:33.300
<v Speaker 3>the dude sitting in California in </v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever who is monitoring this stuff,</v>

1816
01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:37.050
<v Speaker 3>and it's probably more than one person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a shit that there's some</v>

1817
01:29:37.051 --> 01:29:42.051
<v Speaker 3>brown person in the Gaza Strip that </v>
<v Speaker 3>believes it's okay to kill Jewish </v>

1818
01:29:42.121 --> 01:29:47.121
<v Speaker 3>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a shit because it's a </v>

1819
01:29:47.121 --> 01:29:47.121
<v Speaker 3>brown person saying it in the name of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam.</v>

1820
01:29:47.130 --> 01:29:52.130
<v Speaker 3>What they care about is a nonviolent yet</v>
<v Speaker 3>says stupid things guy because he's </v>

1821
01:29:52.681 --> 01:29:55.170
<v Speaker 3>white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>called Tommy Robinson in England or Milo</v>

1822
01:29:55.170 --> 01:30:00.170
<v Speaker 3>Yiannopoulos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying stuff that they obviously that </v>

1823
01:30:00.170 --> 01:30:02.631
<v Speaker 3>touches their sensitivities and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectually lazy to flag that </v>

1824
01:30:02.631 --> 01:30:06.951
<v Speaker 3>immediately and to borrow it from social</v>
<v Speaker 3>media because you're comfortable with </v>

1825
01:30:06.951 --> 01:30:06.951
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1826
01:30:06.951 --> 01:30:10.340
<v Speaker 3>You recognize white supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't take any effort to recognize </v>

1827
01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:13.671
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to invest in studying </v>

1828
01:30:13.671 --> 01:30:13.671
<v Speaker 3>this stuff to know what white supremacy </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1829
01:30:13.671 --> 01:30:17.810
<v Speaker 3>It takes a bit of effort to study Brown </v>
<v Speaker 3>peoples ideas that you're unfamiliar </v>

1830
01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:22.611
<v Speaker 3>with and recognize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a terrorist organization that's </v>

1831
01:30:22.611 --> 01:30:23.730
<v Speaker 3>freely operating on social media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know specifically on twitter,</v>

1832
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:27.270
<v Speaker 3>I've actually pulled up their handles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the concerns that twitter</v>

1833
01:30:27.271 --> 01:30:29.250
<v Speaker 3>has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is a valid concern,</v>

1834
01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:34.280
<v Speaker 3>is that when you have people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying hateful things and you have </v>

1835
01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:35.460
<v Speaker 3>people that are saying whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>white supremacy or whatever,</v>

1836
01:30:35.461 --> 01:30:40.461
<v Speaker 3>even if it's stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem is there is a rallying cry </v>

1837
01:30:40.461 --> 01:30:44.931
<v Speaker 3>of trolls that follow behind them and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>builds up momentum and it gets pretty </v>

1838
01:30:44.931 --> 01:30:49.311
<v Speaker 3>stunning and that was what was happening</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Milo and by silencing Milo off </v>

1839
01:30:49.311 --> 01:30:54.261
<v Speaker 3>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have essentially removed him from </v>

1840
01:30:54.261 --> 01:30:54.261
<v Speaker 3>the public discourse.</v>

1841
01:30:54.261 --> 01:30:57.570
<v Speaker 3>You don't hear about him anymore because</v>
<v Speaker 3>of this because of these things,</v>

1842
01:30:57.630 --> 01:30:59.790
<v Speaker 3>but imagine what that does in Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the terrorist groups.</v>

1843
01:31:01.050 --> 01:31:06.050
<v Speaker 3>Everything you've just said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way I agree with and multiply </v>

1844
01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:09.141
<v Speaker 3>that for groups that have infrastructure</v>
<v Speaker 3>in multiple countries with actual </v>

1845
01:31:09.141 --> 01:31:11.940
<v Speaker 3>organizational hierarchies and plan </v>
<v Speaker 3>means of distributing,</v>

1846
01:31:11.970 --> 01:31:14.940
<v Speaker 3>distributing their ideas across entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>populations,</v>

1847
01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:18.150
<v Speaker 3>physically fighting in wars right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>such as Hezbollah and Syria,</v>

1848
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:20.490
<v Speaker 3>killing Sunni Muslim rebels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1849
01:31:20.690 --> 01:31:25.690
<v Speaker 3>and so imagine that and the and the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are able to rally a mob in Pakistan </v>

1850
01:31:25.690 --> 01:31:26.610
<v Speaker 3>on blast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me as an example,</v>

1851
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:31.790
<v Speaker 3>all it takes for some personal and </v>
<v Speaker 3>social media to accuse and other </v>

1852
01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:34.370
<v Speaker 3>personal blast for me and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably going to get killed the very </v>

1853
01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:34.370
<v Speaker 3>next day and it happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1854
01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:38.160
<v Speaker 3>but because these Californian based </v>
<v Speaker 3>social media companies are unaware of,</v>

1855
01:31:38.550 --> 01:31:43.550
<v Speaker 3>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the cultural implications of those </v>

1856
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.550
<v Speaker 3>sorts of organizations and groups and </v>
<v Speaker 3>listed terrorist groups.</v>

1857
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:45.450
<v Speaker 3>Mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are this completely.</v>

1858
01:31:45.451 --> 01:31:47.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no barring on any of their activity.</v>

1859
01:31:47.730 --> 01:31:52.730
<v Speaker 3>There's also the same thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have with youtube and with a lot of </v>

1860
01:31:52.730 --> 01:31:56.031
<v Speaker 3>these other social media organizations </v>
<v Speaker 3>and companies is they don't have to </v>

1861
01:31:56.041 --> 01:32:00.220
<v Speaker 3>respond or give you any reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can say it violates</v>

1862
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:02.410
<v Speaker 4>our terms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what are those terms?</v>

1863
01:32:02.411 --> 01:32:04.210
<v Speaker 4>Those terms aren't even listed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It will be vague,</v>

1864
01:32:04.211 --> 01:32:05.440
<v Speaker 4>like no hate speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1865
01:32:05.441 --> 01:32:07.930
<v Speaker 4>Well what's hate speech?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what do you say?</v>

1866
01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:09.490
<v Speaker 4>Like what is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you,</v>

1867
01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:12.010
<v Speaker 4>what is your clear policy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are your guidelines?</v>

1868
01:32:12.130 --> 01:32:14.860
<v Speaker 4>How does someone avoid violating your </v>
<v Speaker 4>guidelines?</v>

1869
01:32:14.861 --> 01:32:19.861
<v Speaker 4>They don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and how is the president of the United </v>

1870
01:32:19.861 --> 01:32:22.320
<v Speaker 4>States not nonviolent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Violating those demonetization is </v>

1871
01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:26.281
<v Speaker 4>another way that they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll remove the ability to put </v>

1872
01:32:26.281 --> 01:32:26.281
<v Speaker 4>advertising on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

1873
01:32:26.281 --> 01:32:30.220
<v Speaker 4>on a conversation that they don't like </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it doesn't have to be like my </v>

1874
01:32:30.220 --> 01:32:32.470
<v Speaker 4>conversation with Douglas Murray was </v>
<v Speaker 4>demonic d without any explanation.</v>

1875
01:32:32.530 --> 01:32:33.610
<v Speaker 4>None.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zero.</v>

1876
01:32:33.611 --> 01:32:35.140
<v Speaker 4>They don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Douglas is,</v>

1877
01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:38.760
<v Speaker 4>he's talking to this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a hundred percent.</v>

1878
01:32:38.770 --> 01:32:40.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you listen to our act,</v>

1879
01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:44.800
<v Speaker 4>the actual context of our conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was nothing even remotely remotely</v>

1880
01:32:44.801 --> 01:32:45.950
<v Speaker 4>hateful about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1881
01:32:46.210 --> 01:32:51.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean these are probably the companies </v>

1882
01:32:51.210 --> 01:32:51.210
<v Speaker 4>they've got the right to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to choose what are the policy.</v>

1883
01:32:51.210 --> 01:32:55.560
<v Speaker 4>The only thing I would expect from a </v>
<v Speaker 4>private company is show a consistent </v>

1884
01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:55.560
<v Speaker 4>policy tools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These things,</v>

1885
01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:57.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't like hate speech than Brown</v>

1886
01:32:57.880 --> 01:33:02.880
<v Speaker 4>band Brown people who were also </v>
<v Speaker 4>advocating more than just the hate </v>

1887
01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:02.880
<v Speaker 4>speech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but actually preaching volunteerism.</v>

1888
01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:03.400
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1889
01:33:03.401 --> 01:33:05.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a strange time for this man because</v>

1890
01:33:05.861 --> 01:33:10.861
<v Speaker 4>it's also a time where you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicate so instantaneously.</v>

1891
01:33:11.501 --> 01:33:14.650
<v Speaker 4>It's fantastic in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get ideas out so quickly,</v>

1892
01:33:14.651 --> 01:33:19.651
<v Speaker 4>but these hubs of information like where</v>
<v Speaker 4>the information gets distributed are,</v>

1893
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:26.310
<v Speaker 4>are controlled by people that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>think ever knew that they were going to </v>

1894
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:27.550
<v Speaker 4>have this sort of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>

1895
01:33:27.610 --> 01:33:30.840
<v Speaker 4>I think you're seeing that with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Zuckerberg and these trials were the,</v>

1896
01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:31.360
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1897
01:33:31.620 --> 01:33:33.460
<v Speaker 4>the speeches that he's given in front of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Congress.</v>

1898
01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:36.130
<v Speaker 4>Like when you see him on television </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about it,</v>

1899
01:33:36.131 --> 01:33:40.270
<v Speaker 4>you get the sense that this is a guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>that never prepared for this had no idea</v>

1900
01:33:40.271 --> 01:33:45.271
<v Speaker 4>this was going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then all of a sudden from this </v>

1901
01:33:45.271 --> 01:33:48.390
<v Speaker 4>simple social media platform that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be friends sharing photos </v>

1902
01:33:48.551 --> 01:33:52.570
<v Speaker 4>and just talking about girls not set up </v>
<v Speaker 4>to put women.</v>

1903
01:33:52.900 --> 01:33:54.040
<v Speaker 4>There was a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1904
01:33:54.210 --> 01:33:55.600
<v Speaker 4>but I've been to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what was twitter?</v>

1905
01:33:55.601 --> 01:33:57.220
<v Speaker 4>I mean twitter was essentially just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1906
01:33:57.221 --> 01:33:57.880
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1907
01:33:57.881 --> 01:34:00.160
<v Speaker 4>do you remember the old days of twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would be,</v>

1908
01:34:00.161 --> 01:34:05.161
<v Speaker 4>you would use your name like is doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1909
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:06.970
<v Speaker 4>like sam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sam Harris,</v>

1910
01:34:06.971 --> 01:34:10.300
<v Speaker 4>like Sam Harris is at the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would say that almost if you were in</v>

1911
01:34:10.301 --> 01:34:15.301
<v Speaker 4>a third person that was the original </v>
<v Speaker 4>form that people would use twitter come </v>

1912
01:34:15.301 --> 01:34:15.400
<v Speaker 4>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was weird.</v>

1913
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:20.430
<v Speaker 4>It was a weird way of talking and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>people started just writing what they </v>

1914
01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:25.380
<v Speaker 4>thought and it just became and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>became ideology and then it became a </v>

1915
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:30.510
<v Speaker 4>sharing links,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sharing links and interesting articles </v>

1916
01:34:30.510 --> 01:34:30.510
<v Speaker 4>is a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this,</v>

1917
01:34:30.670 --> 01:34:33.520
<v Speaker 4>to me that's the only good part of it </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1918
01:34:33.521 --> 01:34:38.521
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I've just discovered that and that </v>

1919
01:34:38.521 --> 01:34:41.320
<v Speaker 4>was most of my attachment to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I genuinely use it to,</v>

1920
01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:41.990
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

1921
01:34:42.090 --> 01:34:42.780
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

1922
01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:45.340
<v Speaker 4>as a curator of newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I follow interesting people,</v>

1923
01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:48.850
<v Speaker 4>they they tweet interesting stuff and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I consume it that way,</v>

1924
01:34:49.390 --> 01:34:52.600
<v Speaker 4>but noticing what's coming back at me in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Atlantis.</v>

1925
01:34:52.610 --> 01:34:57.610
<v Speaker 4>I put something out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>know a podcast and then I looked to see </v>

1926
01:34:57.610 --> 01:34:58.070
<v Speaker 4>it's being received on</v>

1927
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:01.640
<v Speaker 2>twitter and I don't tend to do that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>other forums.</v>

1928
01:35:01.641 --> 01:35:03.800
<v Speaker 2>I don't really look at facebook comments</v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

1929
01:35:04.110 --> 01:35:06.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't look at Youtube or Youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>assessable.</v>

1930
01:35:07.190 --> 01:35:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1931
01:35:07.630 --> 01:35:10.220
<v Speaker 2>so even if they're for you that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comments are horrible,</v>

1932
01:35:11.790 --> 01:35:13.280
<v Speaker 2>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1933
01:35:13.380 --> 01:35:17.590
<v Speaker 2>It's been started on the youtube </v>
<v Speaker 2>comment.</v>

1934
01:35:17.620 --> 01:35:19.640
<v Speaker 2>Friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's spread everywhere else.</v>

1935
01:35:19.641 --> 01:35:20.650
<v Speaker 2>It's very strange but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I.</v>

1936
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:25.750
<v Speaker 2>But one thing I found that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>change your settings and twitter where </v>

1937
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:27.200
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you a screen out,</v>

1938
01:35:27.201 --> 01:35:30.740
<v Speaker 2>people who don't have a twitter egg </v>
<v Speaker 2>photos,</v>

1939
01:35:30.741 --> 01:35:35.741
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a real photo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can screen out people who haven't </v>

1940
01:35:35.741 --> 01:35:38.291
<v Speaker 2>had their email confirmed and I think I </v>
<v Speaker 2>just did those two things and like 90 </v>

1941
01:35:39.261 --> 01:35:41.060
<v Speaker 2>percent of the hate went away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>

1942
01:35:41.061 --> 01:35:43.380
<v Speaker 2>Like it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just doing that just.</v>

1943
01:35:43.381 --> 01:35:45.350
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for that.</v>

1944
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:46.950
<v Speaker 2>You should do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Except I'm.</v>

1945
01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:51.200
<v Speaker 2>I think it's better to not actually even</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at what's coming back at.</v>

1946
01:35:51.201 --> 01:35:52.790
<v Speaker 2>You would have taken it off your phone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1947
01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:54.850
<v Speaker 2>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think looking,</v>

1948
01:35:54.851 --> 01:35:59.851
<v Speaker 2>looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife Rachel will be very happy with </v>

1949
01:35:59.851 --> 01:36:03.281
<v Speaker 2>that and then she should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she'd probably wish that I did </v>

1950
01:36:03.281 --> 01:36:03.710
<v Speaker 2>tweak on it to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you read things and get angry?</v>

1951
01:36:03.711 --> 01:36:03.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1952
01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:05.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't react sometimes.</v>

1953
01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:07.520
<v Speaker 3>I like to think I don't react in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

1954
01:36:07.521 --> 01:36:12.521
<v Speaker 3>but I mean I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't say that because actually </v>

1955
01:36:12.521 --> 01:36:12.521
<v Speaker 3>probably I have some times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1956
01:36:12.521 --> 01:36:15.100
<v Speaker 3>I get all that same kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because I took,</v>

1957
01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:18.560
<v Speaker 3>I took a stance on the Syria strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what was your stance?</v>

1958
01:36:18.710 --> 01:36:20.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that um,</v>

1959
01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially now in hindsight,</v>

1960
01:36:22.371 --> 01:36:24.590
<v Speaker 3>were there no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no casualties involved at all.</v>

1961
01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:29.720
<v Speaker 3>There were only three injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we had to take a stance that </v>

1962
01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:34.330
<v Speaker 3>succeeded where Obama failed in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in making sure that red line was </v>

1963
01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:37.451
<v Speaker 3>maintained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the use of chemical weapons cannot </v>

1964
01:36:37.451 --> 01:36:39.940
<v Speaker 3>be tolerated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if it was symbolic even it was </v>

1965
01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:42.231
<v Speaker 3>highly symbolic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes symbolism is </v>

1966
01:36:42.231 --> 01:36:42.231
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I took that stance and uh,</v>

1967
01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:44.210
<v Speaker 3>it got a lot of love on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1968
01:36:44.211 --> 01:36:44.540
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

1969
01:36:44.541 --> 01:36:45.830
<v Speaker 3>because that's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's against the grain.</v>

1970
01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:48.260
<v Speaker 3>A public opinion at the moment is it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>against the strikes,</v>

1971
01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:49.970
<v Speaker 3>so fully acknowledged that when I took </v>
<v Speaker 3>the stance,</v>

1972
01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.530
<v Speaker 3>but I argued a case and I set the case </v>
<v Speaker 3>out in both on my sky news show.</v>

1973
01:36:54.531 --> 01:36:59.531
<v Speaker 3>I have a show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a cohost on the pledge and also on </v>

1974
01:36:59.531 --> 01:37:02.231
<v Speaker 3>my radio show and LBC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I repeatedly argued for why I think is </v>

1975
01:37:02.231 --> 01:37:03.630
<v Speaker 3>important that we don't allow for </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemical weapons and they used to become</v>

1976
01:37:03.631 --> 01:37:05.270
<v Speaker 3>militarized in our world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1977
01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:10.320
<v Speaker 3>and so it was interesting because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>posted the Sky News clip of me sort of </v>

1978
01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:11.640
<v Speaker 3>talking to camera about my reasons for </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and the.</v>

1979
01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:12.300
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1980
01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:16.610
<v Speaker 3>I have this screen grab of the reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually hilarious.</v>

1981
01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:20.210
<v Speaker 3>It's just a puddle of blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is the two extremes.</v>

1982
01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:24.550
<v Speaker 3>They actually started fighting with each</v>
<v Speaker 3>other about who's right about there.</v>

1983
01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:25.530
<v Speaker 3>So obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1984
01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:30.600
<v Speaker 3>here's a clip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why we must intervene in Syria after </v>

1985
01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:32.291
<v Speaker 3>that chemical that blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first one is a guy with an actual </v>

1986
01:37:32.291 --> 01:37:32.960
<v Speaker 3>swastika Nazi symbol on his profile is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is wonderful,</v>

1987
01:37:33.190 --> 01:37:33.810
<v Speaker 3>and it says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1988
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:36.680
<v Speaker 3>at Nordic Scott is is handled Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 3>James,</v>

1989
01:37:36.681 --> 01:37:41.681
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Magid wants Britain to intervene in </v>

1990
01:37:41.681 --> 01:37:42.890
<v Speaker 3>Syria because Putin and acid are kicking</v>
<v Speaker 3>his isis buddies office's end of story.</v>

1991
01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:44.300
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's the guys basically saying,</v>

1992
01:37:44.301 --> 01:37:49.301
<v Speaker 3>but my real reason for calling for that </v>
<v Speaker 3>is because I'm supporting isis against </v>

1993
01:37:49.301 --> 01:37:52.301
<v Speaker 3>the regime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy immediately often responds to </v>

1994
01:37:52.301 --> 01:37:53.870
<v Speaker 3>him and it's called [inaudible] and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

1995
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:56.180
<v Speaker 3>what do you want about Nancy Demoss?</v>

1996
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Magid is funded by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your law is a far right.</v>

1997
01:37:58.351 --> 01:38:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Uncle Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're fighting with each other.</v>

1998
01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:03.280
<v Speaker 1>They actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1999
01:38:03.290 --> 01:38:07.560
<v Speaker 1>this is a captures that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're arguing with each other over</v>

2000
01:38:07.561 --> 01:38:11.520
<v Speaker 1>whether I'm in his camp or his camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The far right and the far left,</v>

2001
01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:14.580
<v Speaker 1>basically you didn't have the words </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicists in the world or the best one.</v>

2002
01:38:14.610 --> 01:38:16.940
<v Speaker 1>So I should take myself out of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>equation.</v>

2003
01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Let them fight each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be even better.</v>

2004
01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:18.640
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

2005
01:38:18.641 --> 01:38:23.641
<v Speaker 1>that's the move to set something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that upset the far right and the far </v>

2006
01:38:23.641 --> 01:38:27.711
<v Speaker 1>left against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can just sneak away while </v>

2007
01:38:27.711 --> 01:38:28.560
<v Speaker 1>they're fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how nuts it is.</v>

2008
01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:32.640
<v Speaker 1>The twitter kind of horses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extremes are,</v>

2009
01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:37.700
<v Speaker 1>are um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're equally irrational and </v>

2010
01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:40.630
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you could be at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>epicenter of,</v>

2011
01:38:40.740 --> 01:38:43.570
<v Speaker 1>of each prompt a both of their problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2012
01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:48.620
<v Speaker 1>That you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a covert jihadist and you're an </v>

2013
01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:51.501
<v Speaker 1>anti Muslim bigot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there's more conspiracy </v>

2014
01:38:51.501 --> 01:38:55.131
<v Speaker 1>theories in terms of like what someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actual motivation for what they're </v>

2015
01:38:55.131 --> 01:38:57.420
<v Speaker 1>saying now than ever before to because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so easy to express them.</v>

2016
01:38:57.600 --> 01:38:58.830
<v Speaker 1>So someone could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2017
01:38:58.831 --> 01:39:00.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's far right or no,</v>

2018
01:39:00.481 --> 01:39:01.220
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2019
01:39:01.221 --> 01:39:03.690
<v Speaker 1>you're just trying to support isis like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2020
01:39:03.691 --> 01:39:08.430
<v Speaker 1>This is this ability to like find some </v>
<v Speaker 1>nefarious reason for your actions.</v>

2021
01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:13.450
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's reducing one's opinion to the </v>

2022
01:39:13.450 --> 01:39:13.450
<v Speaker 1>lowest base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2023
01:39:13.450 --> 01:39:15.750
<v Speaker 1>dodgy motive as opposed to applying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle of charity.</v>

2024
01:39:15.751 --> 01:39:19.380
<v Speaker 1>So if joe says something now I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>either sit here and actually think,</v>

2025
01:39:19.381 --> 01:39:20.610
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust this guy,</v>

2026
01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:24.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't respect him and therefore I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to reduce his opinion to the worst</v>

2027
01:39:24.151 --> 01:39:26.640
<v Speaker 1>possible interpretation that he could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly mean.</v>

2028
01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:30.960
<v Speaker 1>And then use that against him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or I could continue to ask what you mean</v>

2029
01:39:30.961 --> 01:39:32.520
<v Speaker 1>by that because I'm assuming you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

2030
01:39:32.521 --> 01:39:37.521
<v Speaker 1>decent human being in origin and perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>you mean something that I haven't yet </v>

2031
01:39:37.521 --> 01:39:37.521
<v Speaker 1>quite grasped.</v>

2032
01:39:37.521 --> 01:39:41.600
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clarify your own opinion in your own </v>

2033
01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:43.911
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's unfortunate that many </v>

2034
01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:45.420
<v Speaker 1>of our conversations today in the far </v>
<v Speaker 1>left is as guilty of it as the far right</v>

2035
01:39:45.421 --> 01:39:48.450
<v Speaker 1>and they like to think they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is part of that righteousness that</v>

2036
01:39:48.451 --> 01:39:51.390
<v Speaker 1>blinds them from actually committing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this very same injustice.</v>

2037
01:39:51.391 --> 01:39:52.770
<v Speaker 1>They accused the far right of </v>
<v Speaker 1>committing.</v>

2038
01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:53.540
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2039
01:39:53.790 --> 01:39:56.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same bigotry in a mirror image,</v>

2040
01:39:56.281 --> 01:39:58.110
<v Speaker 1>I call it the bigotry of low </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations.</v>

2041
01:39:58.380 --> 01:40:03.380
<v Speaker 1>The low expectations they have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslims are somehow unable to adhere to </v>

2042
01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:03.380
<v Speaker 1>common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decent liberal,</v>

2043
01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:08.121
<v Speaker 1>secular democratic values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's actually a plaguing our </v>

2044
01:40:08.121 --> 01:40:12.351
<v Speaker 1>conversations if only we were able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>strip away our ideological baggage in </v>

2045
01:40:12.351 --> 01:40:14.250
<v Speaker 1>entering conversations and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and allow for,</v>

2046
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:15.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that honest,</v>

2047
01:40:15.420 --> 01:40:20.420
<v Speaker 1>honest conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But of course we say that and then you </v>

2048
01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:23.151
<v Speaker 1>try to replicate our success in a number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of occasions and found yourself </v>

2049
01:40:23.151 --> 01:40:24.300
<v Speaker 1>incredibly frustrated while you are one </v>
<v Speaker 1>more time.</v>

2050
01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unfortunate.</v>

2051
01:40:26.690 --> 01:40:28.860
<v Speaker 1>I found the one reasonable person to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a fight with.</v>

2052
01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just seems like this is a side effect</v>

2053
01:40:32.431 --> 01:40:37.431
<v Speaker 1>of this increased ability to communicate</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that there's so much noise and </v>

2054
01:40:37.530 --> 01:40:38.910
<v Speaker 1>there's so much going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2055
01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:42.210
<v Speaker 1>it's just the most fantastic time for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the distribution of information.</v>

2056
01:40:42.211 --> 01:40:47.211
<v Speaker 1>There's never been a time where it's so </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to distribute information in human </v>

2057
01:40:47.211 --> 01:40:47.211
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy.</v>

2058
01:40:47.211 --> 01:40:48.330
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think we know what to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

2059
01:40:48.570 --> 01:40:53.570
<v Speaker 1>And I think when you deal with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have such rigid ideologies and they </v>

2060
01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:54.520
<v Speaker 1>this incredibly</v>

2061
01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:57.070
<v Speaker 4>easy ability to express these </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideologies,</v>

2062
01:40:57.250 --> 01:40:59.620
<v Speaker 4>there's just so much clashing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just so much,</v>

2063
01:40:59.830 --> 01:41:04.830
<v Speaker 4>so much noise and nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when someone says something that </v>

2064
01:41:04.901 --> 01:41:09.901
<v Speaker 4>they know that they don't have to back </v>
<v Speaker 4>up with facts because they know that </v>

2065
01:41:09.901 --> 01:41:09.901
<v Speaker 4>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were on their position,</v>

2066
01:41:09.901 --> 01:41:11.400
<v Speaker 4>will support it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You say the right keywords,</v>

2067
01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:12.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>white privilege,</v>

2068
01:41:12.911 --> 01:41:15.340
<v Speaker 4>whatever you want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then boom,</v>

2069
01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:19.020
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get a whole slew of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people like those two people in your,</v>

2070
01:41:19.030 --> 01:41:21.190
<v Speaker 4>your mentions battling it out with each </v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

2071
01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:26.400
<v Speaker 4>You're just like kind of picking fights </v>
<v Speaker 4>and starting these little fires and </v>

2072
01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:26.400
<v Speaker 4>letting other people to</v>

2073
01:41:26.400 --> 01:41:27.130
<v Speaker 3>go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I think we've done,</v>

2074
01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:32.160
<v Speaker 3>and it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the advent of social media is that we </v>

2075
01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:34.580
<v Speaker 3>are speaking with my friend mark about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and we've democratized truth and </v>

2076
01:41:34.931 --> 01:41:39.931
<v Speaker 3>when you democratize truth in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the earlier thing you mentioned about </v>

2077
01:41:39.971 --> 01:41:44.971
<v Speaker 3>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>combat sports and your expertise in </v>

2078
01:41:44.971 --> 01:41:47.461
<v Speaker 3>their field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I had come back at you and spoke at </v>

2079
01:41:47.461 --> 01:41:50.941
<v Speaker 3>you with as much authority as you claim </v>
<v Speaker 3>in your expertise with having absolutely</v>

2080
01:41:51.101 --> 01:41:56.101
<v Speaker 3>no history in that expertise whatsoever </v>
<v Speaker 3>and assumed that I have as equal right </v>

2081
01:41:56.261 --> 01:42:00.460
<v Speaker 3>to an unresearched claim to truth in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion,</v>

2082
01:42:00.461 --> 01:42:04.780
<v Speaker 3>as you do and who has a lifetime of </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience in that field.</v>

2083
01:42:05.310 --> 01:42:08.230
<v Speaker 3>There in lies a problem that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>aggregating to myself.</v>

2084
01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:09.490
<v Speaker 3>This notion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2085
01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:14.580
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this kind of belief that my opinion </v>

2086
01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:17.450
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I of course have an equally legal right </v>

2087
01:42:17.450 --> 01:42:19.681
<v Speaker 3>to express it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't mean it carries the same </v>

2088
01:42:19.681 --> 01:42:19.681
<v Speaker 3>weight as your opinion when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>combat sports and it shouldn't.</v>

2089
01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:24.900
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what's happened with the advent </v>

2090
01:42:24.900 --> 01:42:26.970
<v Speaker 3>and worse still you could add your </v>
<v Speaker 3>expressing that opinion as a person of </v>

2091
01:42:26.970 --> 01:42:31.951
<v Speaker 3>color as somehow therefore it's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>criticizable by you because it's his </v>

2092
01:42:33.970 --> 01:42:35.620
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise you are racist and it's Mike.</v>

2093
01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:39.400
<v Speaker 3>That's the key word that it's my truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so the problem with that is when you</v>

2094
01:42:39.401 --> 01:42:42.160
<v Speaker 3>relativized truth in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that then I can speak to you on on an</v>

2095
01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:47.190
<v Speaker 3>equal footing about combat sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which only a mad person who hasn't had </v>

2096
01:42:47.190 --> 01:42:51.391
<v Speaker 3>that history in comments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would think would aggregate to </v>

2097
01:42:51.391 --> 01:42:51.391
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2098
01:42:51.391 --> 01:42:51.850
<v Speaker 3>To do so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but social media I think has allowed for</v>

2099
01:42:51.851 --> 01:42:54.280
<v Speaker 3>that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I gave a Ted talk in about,</v>

2100
01:42:54.281 --> 01:42:59.281
<v Speaker 3>I think it was roughly 2011 about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dangers of this happening in social </v>

2101
01:42:59.281 --> 01:42:59.300
<v Speaker 3>media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dividing us all,</v>

2102
01:42:59.530 --> 01:43:03.520
<v Speaker 3>but I'd say now that if I were to pitch </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Ted talk today,</v>

2103
01:43:03.521 --> 01:43:05.080
<v Speaker 3>I did it at Ted Global.</v>

2104
01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:09.100
<v Speaker 3>If I were to pitch that Ted talk today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't be accepted because it's not</v>

2105
01:43:09.101 --> 01:43:14.101
<v Speaker 3>something new now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's now people know that how social </v>

2106
01:43:14.101 --> 01:43:16.651
<v Speaker 3>media is has divided us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but back then it was new and innovative </v>

2107
01:43:16.651 --> 01:43:21.120
<v Speaker 3>enough as an idea for Ted global to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>we want you to speak about this on and </v>

2108
01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:21.550
<v Speaker 3>it's still up online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if people watched it today,</v>

2109
01:43:21.551 --> 01:43:22.960
<v Speaker 3>they think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how on earth did that become a Ted talk?</v>

2110
01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:27.280
<v Speaker 3>Because there was this heady day back </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2111
01:43:27.281 --> 01:43:27.910
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

2112
01:43:27.911 --> 01:43:28.810
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven years ago,</v>

2113
01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:32.890
<v Speaker 3>this kind of hope filled moment where </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone thought Google,</v>

2114
01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:37.920
<v Speaker 3>facebook and twitter and generally </v>
<v Speaker 3>social media and also tech companies </v>

2115
01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:42.060
<v Speaker 3>were like the good guys that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies weren't actually companies </v>

2116
01:43:42.060 --> 01:43:44.140
<v Speaker 3>that they were on our side against the </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporate world and it turns out.</v>

2117
01:43:44.141 --> 01:43:46.300
<v Speaker 3>I think we've just hit this moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You mentioned Zuckerberg.</v>

2118
01:43:46.301 --> 01:43:51.301
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we've culturally come to this </v>

2119
01:43:51.301 --> 01:43:51.800
<v Speaker 3>moment now where think symbolized by his</v>
<v Speaker 3>testimony at Congress</v>

2120
01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:53.240
<v Speaker 4>that those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2121
01:43:53.250 --> 01:43:54.740
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that honeymoon period is over,</v>

2122
01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:59.770
<v Speaker 4>people now view him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think quite firmly and squarely as a </v>

2123
01:43:59.770 --> 01:44:03.881
<v Speaker 4>ceo of a very rich company as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy in my club that I'm friends with </v>

2124
01:44:05.001 --> 01:44:06.800
<v Speaker 4>WHO's on my side against the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2125
01:44:06.801 --> 01:44:07.800
<v Speaker 4>and that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2126
01:44:08.170 --> 01:44:13.040
<v Speaker 4>Google used to have that slogan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't do evil jumbly they still have it.</v>

2127
01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:19.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean the problem is the incentives are</v>
<v Speaker 4>all wrong and so actually I was just at </v>

2128
01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:22.130
<v Speaker 4>Ted and will they give you a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>how far the rod has spread here?</v>

2129
01:44:22.131 --> 01:44:27.131
<v Speaker 4>So I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found myself at a dinner sitting next </v>

2130
01:44:27.131 --> 01:44:29.741
<v Speaker 4>to a neuroscientist who thought that </v>
<v Speaker 4>this Ezra Klein thing followed me around</v>

2131
01:44:32.581 --> 01:44:37.581
<v Speaker 4>at Ted and it's because many people have</v>
<v Speaker 4>listened to the podcast and he thought </v>

2132
01:44:37.581 --> 01:44:40.790
<v Speaker 4>Charles Murray should have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>physically attacked at Middlebury.</v>

2133
01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:42.860
<v Speaker 4>This is a neuro as a neuroscientist.</v>

2134
01:44:42.860 --> 01:44:47.000
<v Speaker 4>Academic was impeccable person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise.</v>

2135
01:44:47.410 --> 01:44:48.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he was,</v>

2136
01:44:48.231 --> 01:44:51.380
<v Speaker 4>after we wound up having to fight a or a</v>
<v Speaker 4>dinner over it,</v>

2137
01:44:51.381 --> 01:44:53.960
<v Speaker 4>I think he was somewhat chagrined by </v>
<v Speaker 4>having expressed that opinion,</v>

2138
01:44:53.961 --> 01:44:55.430
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how,</v>

2139
01:44:55.460 --> 01:45:00.460
<v Speaker 4>how emotionally hijacked people are by </v>
<v Speaker 4>this issue and uh,</v>

2140
01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.160
<v Speaker 4>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2141
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:03.710
<v Speaker 4>that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just.</v>

2142
01:45:03.711 --> 01:45:05.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the other thing that's new.</v>

2143
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:08.870
<v Speaker 4>This is the other thing that it's new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The left advocating for violence.</v>

2144
01:45:09.230 --> 01:45:10.280
<v Speaker 4>This is very new.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2145
01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:11.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2146
01:45:11.001 --> 01:45:15.320
<v Speaker 4>I always felt like the left was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nonviolent.</v>

2147
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:19.390
<v Speaker 4>The whole idea behind being progressive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like nonviolence was,</v>

2148
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:23.880
<v Speaker 4>was a genuine aspect of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And free speech to things.</v>

2149
01:45:23.881 --> 01:45:25.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are two things that have been sort</v>

2150
01:45:25.641 --> 01:45:30.641
<v Speaker 4>of stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That free speech is fine as long as </v>

2151
01:45:30.641 --> 01:45:32.570
<v Speaker 4>you're not saying speech that I disagree</v>
<v Speaker 4>with and nonviolence.</v>

2152
01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:35.330
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In less we need to use violence,</v>

2153
01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:37.420
<v Speaker 4>which is in the people that are saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2154
01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:41.030
<v Speaker 4>Like if you watch these anti for people </v>
<v Speaker 4>like Jesus Christ,</v>

2155
01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:46.180
<v Speaker 4>the most incompetent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>violent people you've ever seen in your </v>

2156
01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:46.180
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It depends.</v>

2157
01:45:46.180 --> 01:45:46.760
<v Speaker 4>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your sensibility.</v>

2158
01:45:46.761 --> 01:45:50.900
<v Speaker 4>Does that ever make it funny?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys are terrible at it.</v>

2159
01:45:51.110 --> 01:45:56.110
<v Speaker 4>There's videos of these guys practicing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's videos of Antifa they had got </v>

2160
01:45:56.541 --> 01:46:01.541
<v Speaker 4>together and decided to train and </v>
<v Speaker 4>prepare for violence and so they're </v>

2161
01:46:01.541 --> 01:46:05.471
<v Speaker 4>doing these martial arts classes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have people teach them like holy </v>

2162
01:46:05.471 --> 01:46:08.801
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like at the average high school kid </v>

2163
01:46:08.801 --> 01:46:11.351
<v Speaker 4>could fuck you guys up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this is the most ridiculous thing </v>

2164
01:46:11.351 --> 01:46:11.351
<v Speaker 4>I've ever seen in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's almost like they're.</v>

2165
01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:16.360
<v Speaker 4>They realize that there's not that much </v>
<v Speaker 4>danger in what they're doing and they </v>

2166
01:46:16.431 --> 01:46:19.460
<v Speaker 4>can kind of play with danger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can play with violence.</v>

2167
01:46:19.461 --> 01:46:21.770
<v Speaker 4>They can put the masks on their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2168
01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:25.370
<v Speaker 4>they're not in Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're out at the Gaza Strip.</v>

2169
01:46:25.410 --> 01:46:30.410
<v Speaker 4>Are there a bunch of counts as a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a guy who went to my old </v>

2170
01:46:30.410 --> 01:46:32.711
<v Speaker 4>university I graduated from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so asked before I did my masters at the </v>

2171
01:46:32.711 --> 01:46:35.681
<v Speaker 4>NSC,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so as has been embroiled in a strike at </v>

2172
01:46:35.681 --> 01:46:37.631
<v Speaker 4>the moment as the student's union has </v>
<v Speaker 4>been supporting professors who were on </v>

2173
01:46:37.631 --> 01:46:41.411
<v Speaker 4>strike and it's over the pension and </v>
<v Speaker 4>pension rights in refused government </v>

2174
01:46:41.411 --> 01:46:42.020
<v Speaker 4>refusing to raise their pension rights </v>
<v Speaker 4>and whatever,</v>

2175
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:44.150
<v Speaker 4>and some of the students came out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>strike,</v>

2176
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:47.350
<v Speaker 4>fall up students defending the </v>
<v Speaker 4>professors and they put,</v>

2177
01:46:47.450 --> 01:46:49.920
<v Speaker 4>they put forward a ring preventing from </v>
<v Speaker 4>attending</v>

2178
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:51.490
<v Speaker 3>their classes and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2179
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:56.590
<v Speaker 3>and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a female black lecturer wanted to cross </v>

2180
01:46:56.590 --> 01:47:00.981
<v Speaker 3>the strike lines to go into teach her </v>
<v Speaker 3>students a white male public school </v>

2181
01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:04.140
<v Speaker 3>educated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>

2182
01:47:04.141 --> 01:47:08.880
<v Speaker 3>very middleclass protester far left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically attacked her.</v>

2183
01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:12.600
<v Speaker 3>He physically attacked a female black </v>
<v Speaker 3>professor.</v>

2184
01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:15.630
<v Speaker 3>So gone is suddenly gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is The white privilege gone?</v>

2185
01:47:15.631 --> 01:47:17.520
<v Speaker 3>Is the male attacking a female?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2186
01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:20.640
<v Speaker 3>gone is all of that non violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the above.</v>

2187
01:47:20.641 --> 01:47:25.641
<v Speaker 3>The name of ideology he legitimized and </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed himself to attack a black </v>

2188
01:47:25.641 --> 01:47:26.160
<v Speaker 3>female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

2189
01:47:26.161 --> 01:47:27.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she was also Muslim,</v>

2190
01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:29.050
<v Speaker 3>so she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she went into the prep,</v>

2191
01:47:31.410 --> 01:47:36.410
<v Speaker 3>he would've had the right Sheila.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She actually said that in her interview </v>

2192
01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:36.410
<v Speaker 3>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a black Muslim female and this white</v>

2193
01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:38.550
<v Speaker 3>kid is just a tip for wanting to teach </v>
<v Speaker 3>my class.</v>

2194
01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:40.650
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>

2195
01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:42.450
<v Speaker 3>This is a crazy world we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2196
01:47:42.451 --> 01:47:43.380
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you.</v>

2197
01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:48.390
<v Speaker 3>Are you optimistic about the future?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2198
01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:56.060
<v Speaker 3>I say that because it's going to take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lifetime's work and I don't think that </v>

2199
01:47:56.060 --> 01:47:59.001
<v Speaker 3>in our lifetime much is gonna Change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe for the next generation.</v>

2200
01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:05.860
<v Speaker 2>What is the picture of how do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>conceive of your job at the moment and,</v>

2201
01:48:05.890 --> 01:48:06.700
<v Speaker 2>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2202
01:48:06.730 --> 01:48:09.490
<v Speaker 2>what is the status quo?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

2203
01:48:09.850 --> 01:48:13.810
<v Speaker 2>isis or the Islamic state is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fading from most people's memory now.</v>

2204
01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:16.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even mine,</v>

2205
01:48:16.031 --> 01:48:21.031
<v Speaker 2>I'm A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm spending much less time thinking </v>

2206
01:48:21.031 --> 01:48:21.031
<v Speaker 2>about it because it seems to visit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let me tell you a story</v>

2207
01:48:21.031 --> 01:48:21.930
<v Speaker 3>so I can answer this question with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

2208
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:23.520
<v Speaker 3>So radical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is my autobiography,</v>

2209
01:48:23.521 --> 01:48:25.140
<v Speaker 3>has a US publication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2210
01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:27.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's random house penguin.</v>

2211
01:48:27.481 --> 01:48:29.160
<v Speaker 3>It's published by the biggest publishing</v>
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>

2212
01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:32.850
<v Speaker 3>When I came to publishing theU ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>s I approached publishing houses,</v>

2213
01:48:32.851 --> 01:48:37.851
<v Speaker 3>but it was after bin Laden was killed </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so when we approached 10,</v>

2214
01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:38.850
<v Speaker 3>20,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2215
01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:41.700
<v Speaker 3>publishing houses the problem solve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all said no.</v>

2216
01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:43.170
<v Speaker 3>They said the problem solved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said,</v>

2217
01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:44.270
<v Speaker 3>we think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2218
01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:45.870
<v Speaker 3>we wish you'd come to us five years </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier,</v>

2219
01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:48.270
<v Speaker 3>but problem solve now there's not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem anymore.</v>

2220
01:48:48.271 --> 01:48:53.271
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a bit like what you mentioned is </v>

2221
01:48:53.271 --> 01:48:53.271
<v Speaker 3>sort of your expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2222
01:48:53.271 --> 01:48:55.140
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have been consumed by this subject all</v>

2223
01:48:55.141 --> 01:49:00.141
<v Speaker 3>my life and there are a few people on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this planet that I would take seriously </v>

2224
01:49:00.141 --> 01:49:01.980
<v Speaker 3>on this subject.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm outside especially of Quilliam.</v>

2225
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:04.920
<v Speaker 3>And there are other organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have some really good people,</v>

2226
01:49:04.921 --> 01:49:07.740
<v Speaker 3>but I know them all and we regularly </v>
<v Speaker 3>speak.</v>

2227
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:10.110
<v Speaker 3>So I would say it's all of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>publishing houses.</v>

2228
01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:15.440
<v Speaker 3>I can assure you 100 percent this </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem not only has not been solved is </v>

2229
01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:18.810
<v Speaker 3>going to come back around in a far west </v>
<v Speaker 3>way than you can ever have imagined.</v>

2230
01:49:18.970 --> 01:49:21.720
<v Speaker 3>This is before isis came along.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of them believe me.</v>

2231
01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:23.640
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What then happened,</v>

2232
01:49:23.770 --> 01:49:28.770
<v Speaker 3>my cook book eventually got published by</v>
<v Speaker 3>some very small publishing house in the </v>

2233
01:49:28.770 --> 01:49:31.410
<v Speaker 3>US and has done quite well for them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the point of the story was this.</v>

2234
01:49:31.411 --> 01:49:33.810
<v Speaker 3>Isis came around and people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>suddenly like,</v>

2235
01:49:33.811 --> 01:49:35.280
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where did this come from?</v>

2236
01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:40.820
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those of us who had been monitoring the </v>

2237
01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:40.820
<v Speaker 3>situation knew this was going to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>back around very,</v>

2238
01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:43.200
<v Speaker 3>very heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now that isis has been pushed back,</v>

2239
01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:48.250
<v Speaker 3>and this is where this story is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the point of the story is we've got to </v>

2240
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:51.990
<v Speaker 3>resist the temptation to believe the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem has been solved because the the </v>

2241
01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:55.951
<v Speaker 3>organization known as Isis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which isn't a bureaucracy has been </v>

2242
01:49:55.951 --> 01:50:00.061
<v Speaker 3>fought back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the ideology upon which that </v>

2243
01:50:00.061 --> 01:50:02.770
<v Speaker 3>organization was built is still very </v>
<v Speaker 3>much alive and it's still strong.</v>

2244
01:50:03.460 --> 01:50:07.840
<v Speaker 3>What al Qaeda did while the whole world </v>
<v Speaker 3>was focused on Isis was exploited,</v>

2245
01:50:08.170 --> 01:50:13.170
<v Speaker 3>that opportunity to rebuild and regroup </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they've been a rebuilding and Syria.</v>

2246
01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:16.600
<v Speaker 3>Now they are stronger than they have </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever been,</v>

2247
01:50:16.601 --> 01:50:21.601
<v Speaker 3>even under binladin because for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first time in the history of that </v>

2248
01:50:21.601 --> 01:50:24.991
<v Speaker 3>organization,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are firmly embedded within the </v>

2249
01:50:24.991 --> 01:50:27.781
<v Speaker 3>Syrian population as a genuinely kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>viewed by the people that they were </v>

2250
01:50:27.781 --> 01:50:30.940
<v Speaker 3>fighting on behalf of as a grassroots </v>
<v Speaker 3>resistance organization.</v>

2251
01:50:30.941 --> 01:50:33.960
<v Speaker 3>Whereas before that they were seen as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorist group that was like a,</v>

2252
01:50:34.210 --> 01:50:39.210
<v Speaker 3>just like a vanguard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've embedded themselves in the </v>

2253
01:50:39.210 --> 01:50:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Syrian population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the Yemeni civil war.</v>

2254
01:50:39.580 --> 01:50:41.680
<v Speaker 3>They've embedded themselves in north </v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa,</v>

2255
01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:46.740
<v Speaker 3>east Africa and in Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they are resurgent and they are </v>

2256
01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:50.431
<v Speaker 3>grooming Hamza bin Laden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who has been not in some and the </v>

2257
01:50:50.431 --> 01:50:53.020
<v Speaker 3>grooming infant leadership and a time </v>
<v Speaker 3>will come maybe in a couple of months,</v>

2258
01:50:53.021 --> 01:50:58.021
<v Speaker 3>maybe in a couple of years where they </v>
<v Speaker 3>announced Hamza bin Ladin as a new </v>

2259
01:50:58.021 --> 01:50:58.990
<v Speaker 3>leader of al Qaeda currently at Simon's </v>
<v Speaker 3>Zawahari.</v>

2260
01:50:59.350 --> 01:51:04.350
<v Speaker 3>When they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once they're grooming has been complete </v>

2261
01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:04.350
<v Speaker 3>and assuming Hamza isn't killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2262
01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:09.780
<v Speaker 3>up until then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the fragments of what remains of </v>

2263
01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:11.500
<v Speaker 3>Isis will probably rejoin all kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>under Hamza bin Laden.</v>

2264
01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:15.220
<v Speaker 3>And you'll have a stronger than ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>before on Kaleida organization.</v>

2265
01:51:15.221 --> 01:51:20.221
<v Speaker 3>And we've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to remember that we never </v>

2266
01:51:20.221 --> 01:51:20.221
<v Speaker 3>expected isis to emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Emergent,</v>

2267
01:51:20.221 --> 01:51:20.980
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll come back with a vengeance.</v>

2268
01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:24.180
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the,</v>

2269
01:51:24.690 --> 01:51:27.370
<v Speaker 3>the politics between the remnants of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Isis,</v>

2270
01:51:27.670 --> 01:51:29.250
<v Speaker 3>isis and al Qaeda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2271
01:51:29.251 --> 01:51:34.251
<v Speaker 3>how has it been hard in succession to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the leadership solves that problem of </v>

2272
01:51:34.251 --> 01:51:37.591
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because the isis guys were originally </v>

2273
01:51:37.591 --> 01:51:39.640
<v Speaker 3>all kind of Isis was al Qaeda in Syria </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they broke away after bin Laden died</v>

2274
01:51:39.641 --> 01:51:42.550
<v Speaker 3>because they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had pledged allegiance to bin Ladin</v>

2275
01:51:42.730 --> 01:51:45.760
<v Speaker 3>and the new leader of al Qaeda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ayman Suare is by all accounts,</v>

2276
01:51:45.761 --> 01:51:48.460
<v Speaker 3>a rather uncharismatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

2277
01:51:48.670 --> 01:51:49.720
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a pediatrician.</v>

2278
01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:52.870
<v Speaker 3>He's not really a kind of bin Laden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had the pediatrician.</v>

2279
01:51:52.871 --> 01:51:53.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a pro.</v>

2280
01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:58.380
<v Speaker 3>He's Egyptian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's an Egyptian pediatrician from a </v>

2281
01:51:58.380 --> 01:51:58.380
<v Speaker 3>very well off Egyptian family by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2282
01:51:58.380 --> 01:52:02.940
<v Speaker 3>I think his grandfather was the Egyptian</v>
<v Speaker 3>ambassador to the UN pharmacists and </v>

2283
01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:04.480
<v Speaker 3>it's been loud and clearly had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>charisma,</v>

2284
01:52:04.750 --> 01:52:06.160
<v Speaker 3>the wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the presence,</v>

2285
01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:07.390
<v Speaker 3>the looks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had all of it.</v>

2286
01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:10.280
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't as worries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2287
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:11.340
<v Speaker 3>competitive bin Ladin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

2288
01:52:11.341 --> 01:52:16.341
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't say if the guys that broke </v>
<v Speaker 3>away from all kind of centers a watery,</v>

2289
01:52:16.481 --> 01:52:18.850
<v Speaker 3>the current leader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we pledged allegiance to be lighting,</v>

2290
01:52:18.890 --> 01:52:21.130
<v Speaker 3>we owe you nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not our Amir,</v>

2291
01:52:21.250 --> 01:52:26.250
<v Speaker 3>our leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Hamza bin Ladin comes back in as the </v>

2292
01:52:26.250 --> 01:52:30.481
<v Speaker 3>leader of all kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it solves that problem because of those </v>

2293
01:52:30.481 --> 01:52:33.811
<v Speaker 3>remnants of Isis have a loyalty to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bin Ladin Name and had been in family </v>

2294
01:52:33.811 --> 01:52:37.861
<v Speaker 3>and they remember what they consider </v>
<v Speaker 3>their glory days fighting under on the </v>

2295
01:52:37.861 --> 01:52:37.861
<v Speaker 3>bin Laden.</v>

2296
01:52:39.150 --> 01:52:41.020
<v Speaker 3>That's not nice to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's no good.</v>

2297
01:52:41.050 --> 01:52:41.330
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2298
01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:46.350
<v Speaker 3>The problem has not gone away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you that the problem and the </v>

2299
01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:49.591
<v Speaker 3>problem is the ideology and it will not </v>
<v Speaker 3>be dealt with until we deal with this </v>

2300
01:52:49.591 --> 01:52:50.510
<v Speaker 3>ideology and it's why it's so dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

2301
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:55.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was this awful term that I railed </v>

2302
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:56.540
<v Speaker 3>against.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so frustrating to see.</v>

2303
01:52:56.541 --> 01:53:01.541
<v Speaker 3>Under Obama's presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the US State Department officially </v>

2304
01:53:01.541 --> 01:53:02.690
<v Speaker 3>adopted as their name for challenging </v>
<v Speaker 3>this problem.</v>

2305
01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:06.860
<v Speaker 3>They adopted the term al Qaeda inspired </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremism.</v>

2306
01:53:07.670 --> 01:53:10.280
<v Speaker 3>Of course it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It isn't al Qaeda,</v>

2307
01:53:10.281 --> 01:53:15.281
<v Speaker 3>that it inspired extremism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's extremism that inspired al Qaeda </v>

2308
01:53:15.281 --> 01:53:16.340
<v Speaker 3>and it's for the purposes of political </v>
<v Speaker 3>correctness,</v>

2309
01:53:16.341 --> 01:53:21.341
<v Speaker 3>you adopt this term and the State </v>
<v Speaker 3>Department officially that we're </v>

2310
01:53:21.341 --> 01:53:24.041
<v Speaker 3>fighting across the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are fighting al Qaeda inspired </v>

2311
01:53:24.041 --> 01:53:25.040
<v Speaker 3>extremism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My former organization,</v>

2312
01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:30.520
<v Speaker 3>his caliphate espousing organization </v>
<v Speaker 3>that believes in their ideal caliphate </v>

2313
01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:31.790
<v Speaker 3>that gays should be killed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a doctorate,</v>

2314
01:53:31.791 --> 01:53:36.791
<v Speaker 3>she should be stoned to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were there before all Kinda and </v>

2315
01:53:36.791 --> 01:53:37.860
<v Speaker 3>this ideology has been there before on </v>
<v Speaker 3>cod.</v>

2316
01:53:37.890 --> 01:53:42.890
<v Speaker 3>Okada was one of a long line of groups </v>
<v Speaker 3>that came as a result of the Islamist </v>

2317
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:44.990
<v Speaker 3>ideology and we've got to start focusing</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the ideology itself,</v>

2318
01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:50.320
<v Speaker 3>not the physical groups that spring up </v>
<v Speaker 3>from it because they can change their </v>

2319
01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:50.320
<v Speaker 3>name.</v>

2320
01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:52.960
<v Speaker 2>As you point out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a another layer to the ideology</v>

2321
01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:55.630
<v Speaker 2>that is all that is even more well </v>
<v Speaker 2>subscribed,</v>

2322
01:53:55.990 --> 01:53:58.210
<v Speaker 2>that present social and political </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

2323
01:53:58.211 --> 01:53:59.680
<v Speaker 2>So for this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

2324
01:53:59.681 --> 01:54:03.760
<v Speaker 2>there are conservative Muslims who don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>support al Qaeda.</v>

2325
01:54:03.790 --> 01:54:05.260
<v Speaker 2>They're not jihadists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They they can.</v>

2326
01:54:05.290 --> 01:54:09.640
<v Speaker 2>They would honestly say bin Ladin </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't represent my brand of Islam,</v>

2327
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:14.910
<v Speaker 2>but these are still people who will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who will say that homosexuals should be </v>

2328
01:54:14.910 --> 01:54:15.060
<v Speaker 2>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2329
01:54:15.150 --> 01:54:20.150
<v Speaker 2>so there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the apparent allies against </v>

2330
01:54:20.150 --> 01:54:25.110
<v Speaker 2>extremism can still be people with so </v>
<v Speaker 2>with religiously mandated social </v>

2331
01:54:25.110 --> 01:54:29.350
<v Speaker 2>attitudes that just cannot be </v>
<v Speaker 2>assimilated in cosmopolitan societies.</v>

2332
01:54:29.760 --> 01:54:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people who are worse,</v>

2333
01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:36.760
<v Speaker 2>worse than worse than Al Qaeda inspired </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremism.</v>

2334
01:54:37.150 --> 01:54:39.520
<v Speaker 2>There's just this notion that on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>left,</v>

2335
01:54:39.521 --> 01:54:40.630
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was,</v>

2336
01:54:40.631 --> 01:54:45.631
<v Speaker 2>this came out of Obama's mouth and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>came out of Clinton's mouth and it's </v>

2337
01:54:45.631 --> 01:54:45.890
<v Speaker 2>largely why she's wasn't president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2338
01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:50.440
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just generic extremism,</v>

2339
01:54:50.770 --> 01:54:51.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

2340
01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:55.390
<v Speaker 2>like in the same sentence that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to worry about the caliphate.</v>

2341
01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:57.050
<v Speaker 2>You have to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2342
01:54:57.210 --> 01:55:00.380
<v Speaker 2>abortion doctors being killed in the US </v>
<v Speaker 2>once every year,</v>

2343
01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:01.360
<v Speaker 3>15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you read,</v>

2344
01:55:01.361 --> 01:55:06.361
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you remember because President Obama </v>

2345
01:55:06.361 --> 01:55:06.361
<v Speaker 3>refused to use the word Islamist </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremism.</v>

2346
01:55:06.361 --> 01:55:09.981
<v Speaker 3>Of course trump has the other problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks that like rumpelstiltskin by </v>

2347
01:55:09.981 --> 01:55:09.981
<v Speaker 3>repeating it enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've solved the problem.</v>

2348
01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:15.420
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually one of the elements in </v>

2349
01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:15.540
<v Speaker 3>which he was correctly critical of Obama</v>
<v Speaker 3>was an,</v>

2350
01:55:15.541 --> 01:55:20.541
<v Speaker 3>I was at the time vocally critical of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama's reluctance to use the word </v>

2351
01:55:20.541 --> 01:55:24.471
<v Speaker 3>Islamist extremism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we've got no problem when we talk </v>

2352
01:55:24.471 --> 01:55:24.480
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2353
01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:29.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we talk about white supremacist </v>

2354
01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:32.331
<v Speaker 3>ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't mean that all white people are </v>

2355
01:55:32.331 --> 01:55:32.331
<v Speaker 3>supremacists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2356
01:55:32.331 --> 01:55:36.650
<v Speaker 3>what we were doing here is it's actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>attributing precisely specifically what </v>

2357
01:55:36.650 --> 01:55:40.950
<v Speaker 3>the ideology is and believes in white </v>
<v Speaker 3>supremacy and likewise Islamist,</v>

2358
01:55:40.970 --> 01:55:42.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's important.</v>

2359
01:55:42.301 --> 01:55:47.010
<v Speaker 3>So we can that ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm still while not calling it Islam,</v>

2360
01:55:47.490 --> 01:55:52.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're still giving a bit of a leeway </v>

2361
01:55:52.490 --> 01:55:52.490
<v Speaker 3>there for everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the other Muslims,</v>

2362
01:55:52.490 --> 01:55:53.370
<v Speaker 3>but to call it Islamic extremism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mr.</v>

2363
01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:55.110
<v Speaker 3>recognize that it's an offshoot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam.</v>

2364
01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:58.080
<v Speaker 3>It's a manifestation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme or otherwise obvious lamb.</v>

2365
01:55:58.470 --> 01:56:03.470
<v Speaker 3>And thereby we are acknowledging that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's justification's are in Islamic </v>

2366
01:56:03.470 --> 01:56:05.250
<v Speaker 3>scripture as well as of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a multiplicity of other calls,</v>

2367
01:56:05.251 --> 01:56:08.040
<v Speaker 3>these grievances and what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we cannot ignore that.</v>

2368
01:56:08.041 --> 01:56:12.450
<v Speaker 3>It also rests on justifications that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>derived from the Islamic scripture.</v>

2369
01:56:12.451 --> 01:56:14.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can cite for the Arabic that tells you</v>

2370
01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:18.360
<v Speaker 3>in the Koran itself to cut the hand of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the thief or to lash the adulterer.</v>

2371
01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:19.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2372
01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:22.770
<v Speaker 3>these are all Heidi for the saying of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the prophet that says,</v>

2373
01:56:22.771 --> 01:56:24.870
<v Speaker 3>kill the person that changes their </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion.</v>

2374
01:56:24.871 --> 01:56:28.110
<v Speaker 3>This is scripture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so of course there are other factors</v>

2375
01:56:28.111 --> 01:56:33.111
<v Speaker 3>involved as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the factors that gives rise </v>

2376
01:56:33.111 --> 01:56:33.111
<v Speaker 3>to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2377
01:56:33.111 --> 01:56:35.370
<v Speaker 3>is the unreformed scripture that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>extremist site.</v>

2378
01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:38.460
<v Speaker 3>And so we have to acknowledge that Islam</v>
<v Speaker 3>has a role to play.</v>

2379
01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:40.180
<v Speaker 3>I often say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2380
01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:42.000
<v Speaker 3>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under the Obama presidency,</v>

2381
01:56:42.001 --> 01:56:45.360
<v Speaker 3>it was frustrating that the common </v>
<v Speaker 3>refrain was to say that Islam,</v>

2382
01:56:45.540 --> 01:56:48.480
<v Speaker 3>this has nothing to do with Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is absurd.</v>

2383
01:56:48.481 --> 01:56:51.390
<v Speaker 3>Is arguing that the Spanish inquisition </v>
<v Speaker 3>had nothing to do with Catholicism.</v>

2384
01:56:51.690 --> 01:56:52.920
<v Speaker 4>He went even further.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One point,</v>

2385
01:56:52.921 --> 01:56:57.921
<v Speaker 4>didn't he at one point say that not only</v>
<v Speaker 4>does this have nothing to do with his </v>

2386
01:56:57.921 --> 01:57:01.161
<v Speaker 4>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this has less to do with Islam than any </v>

2387
01:57:01.161 --> 01:57:01.420
<v Speaker 4>other related intimately that if it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>just he bent over backwards.</v>

2388
01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:03.780
