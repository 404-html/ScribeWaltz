<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.730
<v Speaker 2>one and we're live sugar Shawn and uh,</v>

5
00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.263
<v Speaker 2>Tim Welch,</v>

6
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.610
<v Speaker 2>your friend that you brought with you here today,</v>

7
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.001
<v Speaker 2>friend,</v>

8
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:20.511
<v Speaker 2>teammate,</v>

9
00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:22.430
<v Speaker 2>coach from Montana,</v>

10
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.931
<v Speaker 2>Montana people.</v>

11
00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:24.350
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

12
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.183
<v Speaker 2>It's a good place.</v>

13
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:26.331
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

15
00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:27.410
<v Speaker 2>But for what we do,</v>

16
00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:28.244
<v Speaker 2>it's not the best place.</v>

17
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.851
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:30.590
<v Speaker 2>How much training can you get in Montana?</v>

19
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.070
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

20
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 2>not the best buy.</v>

21
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was there,</v>

22
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.993
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

23
00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 2>two years ago,</v>

24
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.540
<v Speaker 2>pheasant hunting with Anthony Bordain and that guy is such a maniac.</v>

25
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.620
<v Speaker 2>He trains everywhere.</v>

26
00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:42.620
<v Speaker 2>He goes every day and he found some club,</v>

27
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.010
<v Speaker 2>some local Jujitsu club in Montana and Bozeman.</v>

28
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.180
<v Speaker 2>I was rolling with people.</v>

29
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.051
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

30
00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Bozeman is probably one of the better places to train.</v>

31
00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:53.420
<v Speaker 2>But the one thing good about being from Montana is when we're in Phoenix,</v>

32
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.160
<v Speaker 2>it's like a big process.</v>

33
00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:55.994
<v Speaker 2>Getting a fight.</v>

34
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.301
<v Speaker 2>Sugar.</v>

35
00:00:56.301 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 2>How many amateur fights you have?</v>

36
00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

37
00:00:57.871 --> 00:00:59.930
<v Speaker 2>I had 14 and the nae fights,</v>

38
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.680
<v Speaker 2>amateur MMA fights for kickboxing,</v>

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 2>couple of boxing.</v>

41
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.470
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

42
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.303

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.041
<v Speaker 2>No Commission,</v>

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:15.820
<v Speaker 2>no commission.</v>

00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:20.991
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

65
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.900

<v Speaker 2>It's fucking stunning.</v>

70
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

71
00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:39.494
<v Speaker 2>I definitely want to,</v>

72
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.560
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy being away from there right now just because I grew up there.</v>

73
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:43.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

74
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Being in Phoenix is like,</v>

75
00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:44.601
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

76
00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:45.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be anywhere else.</v>

77
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:46.430
<v Speaker 2>I love being in Phoenix.</v>

78
00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:47.930
<v Speaker 2>The training there is insane.</v>

79
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

80
00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:49.401
<v Speaker 2>Where we're at.</v>

81
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Phoenix is like the fucking Mecca man.</v>

82
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.500
<v Speaker 2>Like we get a train without Gusto Mendez to Keanio every day.</v>

83
00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Like he beat Hoffa Mendez.</v>

84
00:01:56.151 --> 00:01:57.040
<v Speaker 2>He beat Cabrina.</v>

85
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.950
<v Speaker 2>He'd be Ryan Hall.</v>

86
00:01:57.951 --> 00:01:58.350
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

87
00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

88
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.720
<v Speaker 2>He all these people and almost every mile there's a really good gym like boxing,</v>

89
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:02.931
<v Speaker 2>Gym,</v>

90
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:03.320
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu,</v>

91
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.591
<v Speaker 2>gym,</v>

92
00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:04.041
<v Speaker 2>wrestling.</v>

93
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Jim Henry Cejudo has a club.</v>

94
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 2>They're the MMA lab.</v>

95
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:07.071
<v Speaker 2>A junk crowds.</v>

96
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Like where we trained killers everywhere.</v>

97
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:10.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

98
00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:11.960
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the best spots in the world for sure.</v>

99
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:13.090
<v Speaker 2>Phoenix is a,</v>

100
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.200
<v Speaker 2>there's a few hotbeds for MMA.</v>

101
00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:16.610
<v Speaker 2>Obviously la is a big one.</v>

102
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Miami a big one.</v>

103
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.910
<v Speaker 2>Phoenix is a fucking huge one too though.</v>

104
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.261
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

105
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:21.741
<v Speaker 2>The lab,</v>

106
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:22.630
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>

107
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.220
<v Speaker 2>it's a different type of gym than a lot of other gyms.</v>

108
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:28.550
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen many gyms like stay together and I think a big reason is because</v>

109
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:29.181
<v Speaker 2>of John Crouch.</v>

110
00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:31.130
<v Speaker 2>He's like one of the best facilitators out there.</v>

111
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:32.330
<v Speaker 2>He keeps everyone together.</v>

112
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 2>If you don't show up to practice,</v>

113
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:34.521
<v Speaker 2>he'll text you and say,</v>

114
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:34.671
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

115
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:35.151
<v Speaker 2>where are you at?</v>

116
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:36.500
<v Speaker 2>We got to get our priorities straight.</v>

117
00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:39.830
<v Speaker 2>And he really holds everyone accountable and I think that's why it makes it a</v>

118
00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:40.371
<v Speaker 2>really good,</v>

119
00:02:40.371 --> 00:02:41.150
<v Speaker 2>strong place.</v>

120
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

121
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:42.500
<v Speaker 2>He's one of my favorite coaches.</v>

122
00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:43.310
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

123
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.920
<v Speaker 2>he's just a super no nonsense guy.</v>

124
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.360
<v Speaker 2>Never blows his own horn,</v>

125
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.920
<v Speaker 2>not looking for any attention and absolutely knows his shit.</v>

126
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.270
<v Speaker 2>Like when you hear him in the corner,</v>

127
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.440
<v Speaker 2>he knows his shit.</v>

128
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

129
00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:56.180
<v Speaker 2>He's good to have there in the corner,</v>

130
00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:56.421
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

131
00:02:56.421 --> 00:02:57.410
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

132
00:02:57.411 --> 00:02:58.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

133
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 2>be the leader kind of everything and look over</v>

134
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.611
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

135
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:05.611
<v Speaker 3>And like he brought up Benson from when he was a small like just starting.</v>

136
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 3>So it's like we're lucky to be able to learn after that and then be around</v>

137
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:10.241
<v Speaker 3>Benson in the room.</v>

138
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 3>Like the,</v>

139
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 3>he's got a work ethic like no other like is no other joining the military.</v>

140
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 3>I heard he was thinking about joining the military I think is too old now.</v>

141
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 3>Izzy.</v>

142
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

143
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.210
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

144
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.043
<v Speaker 3>I was too old five.</v>

145
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 3>I heard about that too.</v>

146
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.983
<v Speaker 3>How old?</v>

147
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 3>What is the limit?</v>

148
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.010
<v Speaker 3>I thought you could join the military like up to like 36 or so.</v>

149
00:03:28.011 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 3>Like once you get across a certain age they have to make an exception for you.</v>

150
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 3>You'd make that exception.</v>

151
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.541
<v Speaker 3>He's an animal.</v>

152
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:35.374
<v Speaker 3>Can Beast.</v>

153
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

154
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 3>So we're lucky to be around him.</v>

155
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Like the work ethic he brings in the rooms like no other like two and two</v>

156
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:42.881
<v Speaker 3>wrestling drilling.</v>

157
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:43.010
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

158
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 3>I feel like he'd break any man on this planet.</v>

159
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.720
<v Speaker 3>She put the pace on you and it's,</v>

160
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.930
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty cool to learn from.</v>

161
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 3>We're lucky to see it every day.</v>

162
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.821
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

163
00:03:50.821 --> 00:03:53.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean that is one of the most important quote.</v>

164
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.340
<v Speaker 4>Like there's a bunch of important qualities in a fighter,</v>

165
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

166
00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.630
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

167
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.400
<v Speaker 4>being able to perform under pressure,</v>

168
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

169
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.040
<v Speaker 4>creativity.</v>

170
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 4>Creativity's be,</v>

171
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.870
<v Speaker 4>I think that's one of the places that you excel.</v>

172
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.030
<v Speaker 4>You really excel in creativity.</v>

173
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.860
<v Speaker 4>Like when I watched you fight like this,</v>

174
00:04:07.861 --> 00:04:10.440
<v Speaker 4>kids fucking around out there like you're having fun,</v>

175
00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:11.520
<v Speaker 4>you're flowing.</v>

176
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.821
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

177
00:04:11.821 --> 00:04:15.450
<v Speaker 4>when you were telling me today where we're doing a little practicing,</v>

178
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.300
<v Speaker 4>you were saying that you were doing some stuff in fights where you just thought</v>

179
00:04:18.301 --> 00:04:19.021
<v Speaker 4>of it like,</v>

180
00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:19.741
<v Speaker 4>why you're doing it.</v>

181
00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:20.730
<v Speaker 4>It just felt like doing it.</v>

182
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.920
<v Speaker 4>Like there's people that can do that and there's people that never do that right</v>

183
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.980
<v Speaker 4>now when they're in the fight,</v>

184
00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:28.800
<v Speaker 4>they're tightened up and they're fucking sticking to the script and maybe even</v>

185
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.110
<v Speaker 4>sticking to like the real basics,</v>

186
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

187
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.170
<v Speaker 4>like barely even speaking in sentences.</v>

188
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

189
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think a lot of people think too much when they're in there.</v>

190
00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:37.530
<v Speaker 3>It's easier to say.</v>

191
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.611
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

192
00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:39.421
<v Speaker 3>I feel like when I'm in there,</v>

193
00:04:39.421 --> 00:04:40.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm reacting.</v>

194
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm letting my,</v>

195
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.740
<v Speaker 3>letting them all my training takeover.</v>

196
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.741
<v Speaker 3>I'm not really thinking,</v>

197
00:04:43.741 --> 00:04:45.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm just reacting to what they're doing.</v>

198
00:04:45.541 --> 00:04:50.541
<v Speaker 3>And I think that it helps me do what I've been doing is just reacting to certain</v>

199
00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:51.744
<v Speaker 3>situations and</v>

200
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.190
<v Speaker 3>I just feel like I'm on a step ahead of them.</v>

201
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.151
<v Speaker 3>Whoever I'm fighting,</v>

202
00:04:57.151 --> 00:04:58.350
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm a step ahead of them.</v>

203
00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.670
<v Speaker 3>He's really good at like,</v>

204
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.200
<v Speaker 3>the greater the chaos,</v>

205
00:05:01.201 --> 00:05:02.340
<v Speaker 3>the calmer he becomes.</v>

206
00:05:02.341 --> 00:05:02.860
<v Speaker 3>And that's the,</v>

207
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.511
<v Speaker 3>that's the truth.</v>

208
00:05:03.511 --> 00:05:03.901
<v Speaker 3>The bigger,</v>

209
00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:05.040
<v Speaker 3>the brighter the lights are,</v>

210
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.320
<v Speaker 3>the more he shining and completely calm.</v>

211
00:05:07.321 --> 00:05:09.120
<v Speaker 3>And before that last fight against,</v>

212
00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:09.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

213
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.433
<v Speaker 3>Andre,</v>

214
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.430
<v Speaker 3>we watched probably four of Connor's fights right before we walked to the Reno</v>

215
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.420
<v Speaker 3>and sugar sitting there,</v>

216
00:05:15.421 --> 00:05:16.860
<v Speaker 3>zoning in on those fights,</v>

217
00:05:16.861 --> 00:05:18.090
<v Speaker 3>watching the way he walks out,</v>

218
00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:19.830
<v Speaker 3>watching the way he's good with his energy,</v>

219
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.330
<v Speaker 3>smart with his energy.</v>

220
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.110
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

221
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.200
<v Speaker 3>you can really see it in the fight the way he may make some and sugar can watch</v>

222
00:05:25.201 --> 00:05:25.950
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

223
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.960
<v Speaker 3>someone do something and he can do it right away.</v>

224
00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:29.220
<v Speaker 3>It's a really cool talent.</v>

225
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.461
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

226
00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:30.990
<v Speaker 3>Before the last couple of fights,</v>

227
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.621
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

228
00:05:31.621 --> 00:05:32.760
<v Speaker 3>before we go to the arena,</v>

229
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:33.930
<v Speaker 3>we just don't fight pass.</v>

230
00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:34.471
<v Speaker 3>Watch Conor,</v>

231
00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:35.400
<v Speaker 3>watch them walk out,</v>

232
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:36.623
<v Speaker 3>watch,</v>

233
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.500
<v Speaker 3>just watch him,</v>

234
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.670
<v Speaker 3>his body language,</v>

235
00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.523
<v Speaker 3>Connors,</v>

236
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.180
<v Speaker 3>he's the man I love.</v>

237
00:05:42.181 --> 00:05:43.710
<v Speaker 3>Gone or I've always loved Konner since,</v>

238
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.780
<v Speaker 3>since I remember watching his first fight against,</v>

239
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:46.441
<v Speaker 3>what was the first,</v>

240
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 3>like Max Holloway was at his first one.</v>

241
00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.610
<v Speaker 3>UFC and the UFC.</v>

242
00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:48.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

243
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:49.920
<v Speaker 3>I remember watching him and like,</v>

244
00:05:49.921 --> 00:05:51.090
<v Speaker 3>that dude is going to be good.</v>

245
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.520
<v Speaker 4>I think that was his first fight.</v>

246
00:05:52.521 --> 00:05:54.740
<v Speaker 4>He blew his ACL out in that fight.</v>

247
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:55.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that wasn't as first.</v>

248
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you think it was image?</v>

249
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.640
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

250
00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 3>might've been</v>

251
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 4>Marcus perimeter.</v>

252
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.020
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

253
00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

254
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.310
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

255
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.490
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

256
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 4>I stopped.</v>

257
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 4>He stopped image and then he blew his ACL.</v>

258
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:03.291
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

259
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 4>I want to say in the first round against Holloway.</v>

260
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 4>And then he started controlling them on the ground and taking them down.</v>

261
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 4>But that was a very young Max Holloway too.</v>

262
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:11.340
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

263
00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with Holloway when,</v>

264
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 4>I think he was like 20 or something.</v>

265
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.200
<v Speaker 4>He was young.</v>

266
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

267
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.831
<v Speaker 4>Super,</v>

268
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:16.131
<v Speaker 4>super.</v>

269
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:16.911
<v Speaker 4>Yet be,</v>

270
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:17.481
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

271
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:18.314
<v Speaker 4>He's a beast.</v>

272
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.190
<v Speaker 4>He's cool.</v>

273
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 4>He came down to the lab once.</v>

274
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

275
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 4>we just kind of play around spar,</v>

276
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:22.664
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

277
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

278
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.541
<v Speaker 4>I'm excited for that.</v>

279
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 4>He's fighting Ortega next July 7th.</v>

280
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:26.114
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

281
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.601
<v Speaker 4>Very,</v>

282
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:26.691
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

283
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 4>very excited about that hope and I get to get,</v>

284
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.121
<v Speaker 4>get in there.</v>

285
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 4>I hope we can get them tickets.</v>

286
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:30.650
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be sweet.</v>

287
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

288
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.311
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

289
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 4>I'll hook you up.</v>

290
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.541
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

291
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:34.070
<v Speaker 4>he's fascinating to me.</v>

292
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

293
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 4>Max because he's just this guy that like,</v>

294
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.670
<v Speaker 4>I knew he was really good and the knees kept getting better and kept getting</v>

295
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

296
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.971
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

297
00:06:40.971 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Speaker 4>where's the ceiling on this guy?</v>

298
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 4>And then you saw in the Aldo fight when he beat all of the first time and then</v>

299
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 4>the second time,</v>

300
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 4>the second time you're like,</v>

301
00:06:48.651 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ like you,</v>

302
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:51.220
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

303
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 4>you really don't know how good a guy is.</v>

304
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 4>Like you see them in a fight and go,</v>

305
00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:55.941
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

306
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 4>he's really good.</v>

307
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 4>But then you don't see him for a while and you're like,</v>

308
00:06:58.791 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 4>is he better?</v>

309
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.890
<v Speaker 4>Has He slipped?</v>

310
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.551
<v Speaker 4>Is He,</v>

311
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:02.380
<v Speaker 4>is he training hard?</v>

312
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.141
<v Speaker 4>Like where is he at?</v>

313
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 4>Like you don't know until you see him again.</v>

314
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 4>And then when I saw him in that second Aldo fight him like,</v>

315
00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:08.121
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

316
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 4>he's so much better than he was before he,</v>

317
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 4>he yelled at the end of the first round,</v>

318
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 4>he looked over at us and he goes,</v>

319
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:15.950
<v Speaker 4>demands tired.</v>

320
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 4>Like at the end of the first round,</v>

321
00:07:17.841 --> 00:07:18.171
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

322
00:07:18.171 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

323
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 4>he was in and all though was throwing bricks at him.</v>

324
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.240
<v Speaker 4>He was really throwing hard in that first round to try to like establish some</v>

325
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:27.320
<v Speaker 4>distance at all.</v>

326
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.640
<v Speaker 4>He hit him with some shots,</v>

327
00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:29.240
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>

328
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:29.571
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

329
00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:31.100
<v Speaker 4>he had his heartbeat and rock them.</v>

330
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.203
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

331
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.223
<v Speaker 4>Max lost.</v>

332
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:34.460
<v Speaker 4>He's only lot,</v>

333
00:07:34.461 --> 00:07:35.660
<v Speaker 4>well in the UFC,</v>

334
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 4>he lost to Dennis Bermudez caught somewhere early in his career.</v>

335
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:41.331
<v Speaker 4>He lost it.</v>

336
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:42.164
<v Speaker 4>Connor,</v>

337
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 4>I think he only has two or three losses in his career.</v>

338
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:46.251
<v Speaker 4>Three there.</v>

339
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:47.084
<v Speaker 4>Three losses.</v>

340
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.760
<v Speaker 4>Who are they to does it say and Dustin,</v>

341
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:51.760
<v Speaker 4>Dustin,</v>

342
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:51.760
<v Speaker 4>Dustin,</v>

343
00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.040
<v Speaker 4>Dustin,</v>

344
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.430
<v Speaker 4>one 2012 oh,</v>

345
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

346
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.770
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

347
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 4>I love watching him fight that fight against catchy.</v>

348
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:57.680
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

349
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.550
<v Speaker 4>I watched it live.</v>

350
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.070
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

351
00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.361
<v Speaker 4>whew.</v>

352
00:07:59.361 --> 00:08:00.050
<v Speaker 4>That was crazy.</v>

353
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.883
<v Speaker 4>He's a good,</v>

354
00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.900
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was kind of going how,</v>

355
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.661
<v Speaker 4>how that was going to go.</v>

356
00:08:03.661 --> 00:08:06.350
<v Speaker 4>He's going to outbox and he was down some good combos.</v>

357
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:08.630
<v Speaker 4>Justin's leg kicks are a motherfucker,</v>

358
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:09.890
<v Speaker 4>but he takes too many shots.</v>

359
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:10.401
<v Speaker 4>He's just,</v>

360
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:14.720
<v Speaker 4>he's so intent on breaking people and just keeping that pressure on you that,</v>

361
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:15.441
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

362
00:08:15.441 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 4>he's a fucking really good wrestler and you never see any of it.</v>

363
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:19.700
<v Speaker 4>And his fights,</v>

364
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.420
<v Speaker 4>I think he posted something that he's going to kind of switch up to say that.</v>

365
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.691
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

366
00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:24.231
<v Speaker 4>I think he did.</v>

367
00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:27.090
<v Speaker 4>But then he also said he might only have five more fights left if he keeps</v>

368
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:27.963
<v Speaker 4>fights that way.</v>

369
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

370
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's just,</v>

371
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 4>he's just fucking chaos.</v>

372
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:33.411
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

373
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:34.310
<v Speaker 4>he's a Berserker,</v>

374
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.090
<v Speaker 4>but it's so fun to watch him.</v>

375
00:08:36.091 --> 00:08:37.250
<v Speaker 4>It's like you don't want to say anything to,</v>

376
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:38.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm pure entertainment.</v>

377
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

378
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

379
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.771
<v Speaker 4>fuck yeah,</v>

380
00:08:39.771 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 4>he's the Eddie Alvarez fight and the Dustin Poirier fight,</v>

381
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:47.270
<v Speaker 4>but they're so similar in a way that he like almost gets the guy with his leg</v>

382
00:08:47.271 --> 00:08:47.950
<v Speaker 4>kicks hall.</v>

383
00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:51.650
<v Speaker 4>Most breaks him with those leg kicks and then he got caught.</v>

384
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.450
<v Speaker 4>But it worked in the Michael Johnson fight.</v>

385
00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:55.290
<v Speaker 4>So it's like when you see it in the Michael Johnson fight,</v>

386
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.170
<v Speaker 4>when you see like Johnson's leg just starting to give out.</v>

387
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.710
<v Speaker 2>We watched Luis Watch file fight,</v>

388
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Luis Palomino in a elephant with another fe.</v>

389
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 2>It was a world series.</v>

390
00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:06.063
<v Speaker 2>We watched that.</v>

391
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:10.920
<v Speaker 2>He's gnarly to watch live and he kicks low from real close man.</v>

392
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 2>Generates a lot of power.</v>

393
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

394
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.110
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

395
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.920
<v Speaker 2>he literally tying up with you and he's chopping down with low kicks.</v>

396
00:09:16.921 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 2>He's got real loose hips with that,</v>

397
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:19.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

398
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.680
<v Speaker 2>he's able to really bend his body and chopped down.</v>

399
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.011
<v Speaker 2>Nice,</v>

400
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:23.950
<v Speaker 2>tight high garden.</v>

401
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.181
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

402
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:25.014
<v Speaker 2>let me come in.</v>

403
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 2>He fucks people's legs up,</v>

404
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:27.270
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

405
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.470
<v Speaker 2>He does Telford Shit.</v>

406
00:09:28.471 --> 00:09:29.940
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy when you see guys like that,</v>

407
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 2>like when they start to get beat,</v>

408
00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:33.090
<v Speaker 2>you wonder if they're going to start,</v>

409
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:36.690
<v Speaker 2>use those losses as informative or demoralizing.</v>

410
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:39.450
<v Speaker 2>Start to define themselves and then start questioning themselves.</v>

411
00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:42.030
<v Speaker 2>That's why with sugar in training and in a fight,</v>

412
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.021
<v Speaker 2>even in training,</v>

413
00:09:43.021 --> 00:09:45.840
<v Speaker 2>like he'll find the toughest guys to go with and he won't go with those guys and</v>

414
00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:46.021
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

415
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:46.201
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

416
00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 2>they're better than me.</v>

417
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 2>And started to find himself.</v>

418
00:09:47.731 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 2>We'll just use it as informative and learn from it.</v>

419
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:51.210
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

420
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.410
<v Speaker 2>it's another good mentality.</v>

421
00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 2>He's has super positive,</v>

422
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:57.120
<v Speaker 2>good mentality and I think a lot of that comes from eating good and having the</v>

423
00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:57.751
<v Speaker 2>right rest.</v>

424
00:09:57.751 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 2>And hydrating and eating good year round,</v>

425
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.340
<v Speaker 2>not just eating good during a fight camps and blowing up.</v>

426
00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:04.810
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a lot to do with it for sure.</v>

427
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Even the lifestyle,</v>

428
00:10:05.941 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 2>just eating healthy,</v>

429
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:07.921
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

430
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:08.641
<v Speaker 2>all year round,</v>

431
00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:12.510
<v Speaker 2>not just getting healthy for six weeks and then eating like shit after getting</v>

432
00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:13.180
<v Speaker 2>injured.</v>

433
00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Once I really started learning about eating healthy,</v>

434
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.320
<v Speaker 2>a ton of small little injuries went away.</v>

435
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.650
<v Speaker 2>My back would hurt every morning cause that what you're doing wrong before like</v>

436
00:10:22.651 --> 00:10:23.484
<v Speaker 2>what were you eating?</v>

437
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:24.593
<v Speaker 2>Pop tarts,</v>

438
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.880
<v Speaker 2>sugar can just anything shitty.</v>

439
00:10:26.881 --> 00:10:27.391
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

440
00:10:27.391 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Hot pockets,</v>

441
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.240
<v Speaker 2>top ramen and any,</v>

442
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.490
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff that was just raised eating and all.</v>

443
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.290
<v Speaker 2>And then once I started realizing what that stuff's doing to my body and how I</v>

444
00:10:35.291 --> 00:10:36.124
<v Speaker 2>can feel it,</v>

445
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:36.931
<v Speaker 2>it changed.</v>

446
00:10:36.931 --> 00:10:38.280
<v Speaker 2>It changed my whole mindset.</v>

447
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Like eating healthy was one of the biggest things that improved my skills as a</v>

448
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:45.751
<v Speaker 2>fighter.</v>

449
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:48.630
<v Speaker 2>I feel like just as far as my mental thoughts,</v>

450
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.583
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

451

<v Speaker 2>I said I had some sardines last night and then I had some this morning.</v>

455
00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.550

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:07.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

500
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.680
<v Speaker 2>A full day of running.</v>

501
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.570
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're trying to find the balance though.</v>

502
00:12:10.571 --> 00:12:11.231
<v Speaker 2>Like we're eating,</v>

503
00:12:11.231 --> 00:12:13.330
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want to do that on days that we're not training.</v>

504
00:12:13.331 --> 00:12:14.164
<v Speaker 2>We're doing,</v>

505
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:15.400
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to do Kido,</v>

506
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:17.260
<v Speaker 2>so we're just keep the inflammation down in her body.</v>

507
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:19.400
<v Speaker 2>But it's bitter guy that I was just gonna say he,</v>

508
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.610
<v Speaker 2>he's a full Kido guy.</v>

509
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.150
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

510
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.470
<v Speaker 2>he mostly eats meat,</v>

511
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.660
<v Speaker 2>but on days when he has,</v>

512
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:26.380
<v Speaker 2>there it is,</v>

513
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.210
<v Speaker 2>he broke the u s 100 mile record.</v>

514
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:28.900
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

515
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.420
<v Speaker 2>Seven minutes per mile for 12 hours.</v>

516
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:32.020
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

517
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.853
<v Speaker 2>that's the record.</v>

518
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:33.963
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

519
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.620
<v Speaker 2>What a bad ass.</v>

520
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:35.741
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

521
00:12:35.741 --> 00:12:36.071
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

522
00:12:36.071 --> 00:12:37.040
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking savage.</v>

523
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Mental thoughts I run in.</v>

524
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.840
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if he's just in the now just go,</v>

525
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.210
<v Speaker 2>it's gotta be in a trance.</v>

526
00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.230
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

527
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:44.741
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

528
00:12:44.741 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 2>on days where he's running,</v>

529
00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:48.370
<v Speaker 2>he way ramps up his carbs.</v>

530
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.001
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

531
00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:49.211
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

532
00:12:49.211 --> 00:12:53.110
<v Speaker 2>the average person is trying to keep their carbs within like 50 grams or 75</v>

533
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:58.111
<v Speaker 2>grams to stay Kito you've got to recognize that for extreme requirements,</v>

534
00:12:58.181 --> 00:13:00.250
<v Speaker 2>like physical activity ramped that shit up.</v>

535
00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:00.721
<v Speaker 2>So Rob,</v>

536
00:13:00.721 --> 00:13:03.520
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to say that Rob Wolf is really experimenting a lot with that.</v>

537
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.020
<v Speaker 2>It follow him on Instagram.</v>

538
00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:06.370
<v Speaker 2>He's big up on that.</v>

539
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:07.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

540
00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:07.580
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

541
00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.090
<v Speaker 2>and we listened to a lot of Ben Greenfield too,</v>

542

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.740
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we're on a really good track,</v>

552
00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:24.730
<v Speaker 2>especially for sugar.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

562
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.070
<v Speaker 2>And then I went to commentate some local fights up there and I saw Sean and he</v>

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:43.740
<v Speaker 2>was says 18,</v>

564
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:44.590
<v Speaker 2>18 at the time.</v>

565
00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:45.101
<v Speaker 2>And I saw him,</v>

566
00:13:45.101 --> 00:13:45.371
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

567
00:13:45.371 --> 00:13:45.611
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

568
00:13:45.611 --> 00:13:47.030
<v Speaker 2>I kid submitted a,</v>

569
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.860
<v Speaker 2>a wrestler and the first round and I knew at his gym,</v>

570
00:13:49.861 --> 00:13:50.591
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't rest it on.</v>

571
00:13:50.591 --> 00:13:51.760
<v Speaker 2>My Kid's got some good talent.</v>

572
00:13:51.761 --> 00:13:53.830
<v Speaker 2>So I invited him down after I went up to him and I said,</v>

573
00:13:53.831 --> 00:13:54.664
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>

574
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.460
<v Speaker 2>you can stay on my couch for a little bit and come check out the gym.</v>

575
00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Kind of figured he wouldn't.</v>

576
00:13:59.300 --> 00:13:59.951
<v Speaker 2>And I remember,</v>

577
00:13:59.951 --> 00:14:00.784
<v Speaker 2>I remember the,</v>

578
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.410
<v Speaker 2>he told me that I was so jack,</v>

579
00:14:02.411 --> 00:14:02.951
<v Speaker 2>cause I knew Tim,</v>

580
00:14:02.951 --> 00:14:03.760
<v Speaker 2>I seen him on TV.</v>

581
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.720
<v Speaker 2>I didn't meet him personally,</v>

582
00:14:04.721 --> 00:14:06.700
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen him on Bella trees on the fight master show.</v>

583
00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:07.311
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

584
00:14:07.311 --> 00:14:09.280
<v Speaker 2>after my fight I were at the sting bar,</v>

585
00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:09.881
<v Speaker 2>like a local bar.</v>

586
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:12.010
<v Speaker 2>And he came up to me and he offered me that.</v>

587
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:12.521
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

588
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:13.750
<v Speaker 2>I think I called you the next day.</v>

589
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:14.021
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

590
00:14:14.021 --> 00:14:14.261
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>

591
00:14:14.261 --> 00:14:14.381
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

592
00:14:14.381 --> 00:14:15.214
<v Speaker 2>I want to come down.</v>

593
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.480
<v Speaker 2>And we figured it out.</v>

594
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.670
<v Speaker 2>I think I came down a few weeks later,</v>

595
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.480
<v Speaker 2>months later,</v>

596
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:19.731
<v Speaker 2>I came,</v>

597
00:14:19.731 --> 00:14:20.680
<v Speaker 2>not for 10 days,</v>

598
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.600
<v Speaker 2>and it was like one of the most,</v>

599
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.170
<v Speaker 2>the biggest ass wouldn't have ever got in my life.</v>

600
00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:28.660
<v Speaker 2>I remember when we were driving from the airport,</v>

601
00:14:28.661 --> 00:14:29.191
<v Speaker 2>he was talking,</v>

602
00:14:29.191 --> 00:14:29.411
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

603
00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:29.561
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

604
00:14:29.561 --> 00:14:30.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean you were going to the top.</v>

605
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:31.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

606
00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.790
<v Speaker 2>this kid has no idea what he's about to get himself into.</v>

607
00:14:33.791 --> 00:14:34.960
<v Speaker 2>Taking him to the pro practices,</v>

608
00:14:34.961 --> 00:14:35.471
<v Speaker 2>all the people,</v>

609
00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:37.150
<v Speaker 2>because as soon as you get on the team,</v>

610
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.980
<v Speaker 2>everyone fucking hammers on you.</v>

611
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:40.300
<v Speaker 2>The Hammer is on youth beat you,</v>

612
00:14:40.301 --> 00:14:42.520
<v Speaker 2>they break you down mentally to see if you're going to come back.</v>

613
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:43.020
<v Speaker 2>So I was,</v>

614
00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.080
<v Speaker 2>I was there for a full week.</v>

615
00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:45.150
<v Speaker 2>So Monday is striking it.</v>

616
00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Tuesday at wrestling,</v>

617
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.620
<v Speaker 2>I literally did not know how to wrestle.</v>

618
00:14:47.621 --> 00:14:48.730
<v Speaker 2>It didn't notice single leg was,</v>

619
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:48.810
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

620
00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.130
<v Speaker 2>didn't not know anything about wrestling.</v>

621
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

622
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.663
<v Speaker 2>I remember</v>

623
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.190
<v Speaker 3>a good group of people just want me bad.</v>

624
00:14:55.191 --> 00:14:56.024
<v Speaker 3>I remember crying,</v>

625
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.863
<v Speaker 3>leaving practice,</v>

626
00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.400
<v Speaker 3>running on high school to know nothing,</v>

627
00:14:58.401 --> 00:14:59.060
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>

628
00:14:59.060 --> 00:14:59.690
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>

629
00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:00.560
<v Speaker 3>what part of Montana?</v>

630
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:01.760
<v Speaker 3>You from a Helena.</v>

631
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.630
<v Speaker 3>The capital.</v>

632
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.230
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

633
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.501
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

634
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:04.150
<v Speaker 3>I never saw,</v>

635
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.480
<v Speaker 3>I boxed a little bit,</v>

636
00:15:05.481 --> 00:15:06.021
<v Speaker 3>but I never,</v>

637
00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:06.771
<v Speaker 3>never wrestled.</v>

638
00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:07.670
<v Speaker 3>Didn't really grapple.</v>

639
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:08.930
<v Speaker 3>I remember I knew one arm,</v>

640
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:11.480
<v Speaker 3>I knew an armbar off my back is the only thing I knew and that's what I caught</v>

641
00:15:11.481 --> 00:15:12.330
<v Speaker 3>that wrestler and I,</v>

642
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:13.250
<v Speaker 3>I've got him in an arm bar.</v>

643
00:15:13.251 --> 00:15:14.300
<v Speaker 3>I surprised I didn't even,</v>

644
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.020
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

645

<v Speaker 3>I just did that.</v>

647
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:17.270
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

648
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:17.810
<v Speaker 3>came down,</v>

649
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:19.550

656
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:26.690
<v Speaker 3>packed my car,</v>

657
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.890
<v Speaker 3>drove down.</v>

658
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.450
<v Speaker 3>He was living with his girlfriend at the time.</v>

659
00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:30.530
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

660
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:31.460
<v Speaker 3>we stayed there for two weeks,</v>

661
00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:32.360
<v Speaker 3>then we got an apartment.</v>

662
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:32.991
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

663
00:15:32.991 --> 00:15:33.211
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

664
00:15:33.211 --> 00:15:35.240

665
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:40.420
<v Speaker 3>but we got an apartment close to the lab and I just literally went every single</v>

666
00:15:41.331 --> 00:15:41.960
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

667
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:42.830
<v Speaker 3>twice a day.</v>

668
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.450
<v Speaker 3>When he first showed up.</v>

669
00:15:44.451 --> 00:15:45.284
<v Speaker 3>He like,</v>

670
00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:45.990
<v Speaker 3>I was going to,</v>

671
00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.350
<v Speaker 3>I smoked some weed in the night and he was so taken back.</v>

672
00:15:48.351 --> 00:15:48.711
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

673
00:15:48.711 --> 00:15:49.340
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

674
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.180
<v Speaker 3>He looked up to me,</v>

675
00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:52.010
<v Speaker 3>couldn't believe that I was doing that.</v>

676
00:15:52.011 --> 00:15:52.980
<v Speaker 3>Drove you smoked weed.</v>

677
00:15:52.981 --> 00:15:57.290
<v Speaker 3>And my dad didn't find that the detective in in Montana and I would just,</v>

678
00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:58.720
<v Speaker 3>I was raised like weed,</v>

679
00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.593
<v Speaker 3>not good,</v>

680
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:00.220
<v Speaker 3>not good.</v>

681
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.460
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what was going through mine.</v>

682
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.390
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was bad.</v>

683
00:16:02.391 --> 00:16:04.590
<v Speaker 3>Like really bad about it.</v>

684

<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

685
00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:05.894
<v Speaker 3>I remember he came down</v>

686
00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.220
<v Speaker 5>places that went backwards with wheat.</v>

687
00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.940
<v Speaker 5>They had medical marijuana in Montana and now they're removing it.</v>

688
00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:13.500
<v Speaker 5>They're removing all the stores.</v>

689
00:16:13.501 --> 00:16:14.251
<v Speaker 5>When I was there,</v>

690
00:16:14.251 --> 00:16:15.084
<v Speaker 5>they were like,</v>

691
00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.180
<v Speaker 5>they were having some sort of a closeout sale cause they were,</v>

692
00:16:18.181 --> 00:16:19.320
<v Speaker 5>they were getting shut down.</v>

693
00:16:19.321 --> 00:16:21.810
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if that's since been amended or fixed.</v>

694
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:22.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

695
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.560
<v Speaker 3>That's what sucks.</v>

696
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.413
<v Speaker 3>Died.</v>

697
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:25.540
<v Speaker 3>And when he,</v>

698
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:26.373
<v Speaker 3>when he moved in,</v>

699
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.243
<v Speaker 3>when he moved in,</v>

700
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:27.941
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

701
00:16:27.941 --> 00:16:28.774
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

702
00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.400
<v Speaker 3>this kid is fucking pissing me off.</v>

703
00:16:30.401 --> 00:16:31.630
<v Speaker 3>He's not picking up his shit.</v>

704
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.040
<v Speaker 3>He'd not not doing his dishes.</v>

705
00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:35.320
<v Speaker 3>He eats like mom did all that for me and I'm like,</v>

706
00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.070
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

707
00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:37.780
<v Speaker 3>I either could get pissed off and kick them out,</v>

708
00:16:37.781 --> 00:16:38.680
<v Speaker 3>but then I realize I'm like,</v>

709
00:16:38.681 --> 00:16:39.670
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't even know.</v>

710
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:40.421
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't even know.</v>

711
00:16:40.421 --> 00:16:41.171
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to work them.</v>

712
00:16:41.171 --> 00:16:43.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try to treat him like my little brother and help him.</v>

713
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.480
<v Speaker 3>And he was willing to like kind of follow along.</v>

714
00:16:46.481 --> 00:16:48.700
<v Speaker 3>And then he started slowly starting to eat better,</v>

715
00:16:48.701 --> 00:16:51.490
<v Speaker 3>started eat spinach and his back problem started to go away.</v>

716
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.653
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

717
00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.910
<v Speaker 3>what kind of backpack on my back would always hurt.</v>

718
00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:55.960
<v Speaker 3>Always inflamed,</v>

719
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.411
<v Speaker 3>always.</v>

720
00:16:56.411 --> 00:16:57.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it was.</v>

721
00:16:57.311 --> 00:16:58.140
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

722
00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.120
<v Speaker 3>all time I remember getting it looked at my lower,</v>

723
00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.660
<v Speaker 3>lower back.</v>

724
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.050
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

725
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:02.351
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

726
00:17:02.351 --> 00:17:02.861
<v Speaker 3>it was nothing.</v>

727
00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:04.690
<v Speaker 3>It was literally from eating shitty food.</v>

728
00:17:04.691 --> 00:17:07.690
<v Speaker 3>It's just all the inflammation from all the shitty food I was eating.</v>

729
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:08.800
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't know that at the time.</v>

730
00:17:08.801 --> 00:17:09.940
<v Speaker 3>I remember my mom took me in there,</v>

731
00:17:09.941 --> 00:17:11.380
<v Speaker 3>like up beer back's fine,</v>

732
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.720
<v Speaker 3>but it hurts so bad always.</v>

733
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.700
<v Speaker 3>I started eating more anti inflammatories.</v>

734
00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:19.060
<v Speaker 3>I started making shakes with spinach and almond milk and blueberries and Chia</v>

735
00:17:19.061 --> 00:17:19.480
<v Speaker 3>seeds.</v>

736
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.300
<v Speaker 3>I started eating healthier and I'd slowly notice like,</v>

737
00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:22.451
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

738
00:17:22.451 --> 00:17:22.931
<v Speaker 3>I feel better.</v>

739
00:17:22.931 --> 00:17:23.291
<v Speaker 3>I started.</v>

740
00:17:23.291 --> 00:17:25.210
<v Speaker 3>So I started getting more into eating healthier.</v>

741
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.190
<v Speaker 3>I remember just recently,</v>

742
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:28.090
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

743
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:32.920
<v Speaker 3>I had a Vegan diet for six months and the people on Instagram hate me now that I</v>

744
00:17:32.921 --> 00:17:34.270
<v Speaker 3>don't eat vegan diet anymore.</v>

745
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.750
<v Speaker 5>You go off Vegan diet man.</v>

746
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:39.550
<v Speaker 5>That's like when you become a Muslim apostate.</v>

747
00:17:39.551 --> 00:17:40.384
<v Speaker 5>Seriously.</v>

748
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.550
<v Speaker 5>They want death to you.</v>

749
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

750
00:17:42.021 --> 00:17:44.420
<v Speaker 3>Cause I've been posting pictures like I posted a picture of,</v>

751
00:17:44.421 --> 00:17:45.500
<v Speaker 3>I got this um,</v>

752
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.510
<v Speaker 3>grassfed beef jerky for whole foods yesterday.</v>

753
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.830
<v Speaker 3>Got Probably 30,</v>

754
00:17:48.831 --> 00:17:49.650
<v Speaker 3>40.</v>

755
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:50.670
<v Speaker 3>Why aren't you vegan anymore?</v>

756
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Or just meet like people though?</v>

757
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:52.710
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

758
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:55.020
<v Speaker 3>they're mad at me for not eating a Vegan diet anymore.</v>

759
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.030
<v Speaker 3>But I would say like,</v>

760
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.530
<v Speaker 3>I hate that Vegan diet for six months,</v>

761
00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.011
<v Speaker 3>but I did,</v>

762
00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:00.900
<v Speaker 3>I incorporated eggs and do it cause I just couldn't,</v>

763
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.100
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't eating enough.</v>

764
00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.181
<v Speaker 3>But I never,</v>

765
00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:04.170
<v Speaker 3>I never felt bad.</v>

766
00:18:04.171 --> 00:18:05.010
<v Speaker 3>I didn't feel worse.</v>

767
00:18:05.011 --> 00:18:06.930
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't feel great.</v>

768
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:10.560
<v Speaker 3>Once I started eating good quality meeting and I felt my energy levels,</v>

769
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:11.480
<v Speaker 3>I'd wake up on,</v>

770
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.290
<v Speaker 3>my energy levels were way higher.</v>

771
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.030
<v Speaker 3>I just felt more aggressive.</v>

772
00:18:15.031 --> 00:18:16.830
<v Speaker 3>I felt more like manly.</v>

773
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

774
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.590
<v Speaker 3>so if he comes right now,</v>

775
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.250
<v Speaker 3>get getting angry in the content against,</v>

776
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.430
<v Speaker 3>in the contenders.</v>

777
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.840
<v Speaker 3>I know you lost me.</v>

778
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.070
<v Speaker 3>The contender series fight,</v>

779
00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:27.810
<v Speaker 3>he weighed 138 pounds.</v>

780
00:18:27.811 --> 00:18:28.890
<v Speaker 3>He was a Vegan at that time.</v>

781
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.880
<v Speaker 3>I walk sick,</v>

782
00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:31.380
<v Speaker 3>lease dislike skinny.</v>

783
00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.130
<v Speaker 3>There's more to that too than than just the beginning.</v>

784
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.110
<v Speaker 3>I had a concussion,</v>

785
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.280
<v Speaker 3>a bad concussion.</v>

786
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.160
<v Speaker 3>Three weeks out from that fight against Alfred and the tender series.</v>

787
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.320
<v Speaker 3>I remember waking up in the middle night puking.</v>

788
00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:40.741
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

789
00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:41.574
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't train.</v>

790
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:42.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

791
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.270
<v Speaker 3>I remember I even woke up with a little headache going into the fight.</v>

792
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.260
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember it was from,</v>

793
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:47.940
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

794
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:48.161
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

795
00:18:48.161 --> 00:18:49.200
<v Speaker 3>well I was from sparring.</v>

796
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.131
<v Speaker 3>I hit hard,</v>

797
00:18:50.131 --> 00:18:50.341
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

798
00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:50.940
<v Speaker 3>And I remembered,</v>

799
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:51.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm like fuck.</v>

800
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.390
<v Speaker 3>But I knew it was the huge opportunity.</v>

801
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:55.500
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

802
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.550
<v Speaker 3>I like the matchup.</v>

803
00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.590
<v Speaker 3>I knew I just had to go out there and perform.</v>

804
00:18:58.591 --> 00:18:58.801
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

805
00:18:58.801 --> 00:18:59.430
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

806
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.150
<v Speaker 3>I weighed in at one 36 and I walked into the cage at one 38 like I was,</v>

807
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:03.601
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

808
00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:04.261
<v Speaker 3>and you can even look,</v>

809
00:19:04.261 --> 00:19:04.640
<v Speaker 3>go by,</v>

810
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:04.980
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

811
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:05.970
<v Speaker 3>go back and look at that video.</v>

812
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.530
<v Speaker 3>And it looked just unhealthy,</v>

813
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.420
<v Speaker 3>but it all works.</v>

814
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:09.601
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

815
00:19:09.601 --> 00:19:09.900
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

816
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.160
<v Speaker 3>I was so skinny.</v>

817
00:19:11.161 --> 00:19:12.990
<v Speaker 3>I was like 138 pounds right there.</v>

818
00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:13.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

819
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.880
<v Speaker 3>I still dropped his ass.</v>

820
00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.753
<v Speaker 3>Then</v>

821
00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.470
<v Speaker 3>two weeks later we went to to hang out with her buddy,</v>

822
00:19:19.471 --> 00:19:23.550
<v Speaker 3>a Scott Holtzman in the UFC for a UFC Fresno and a Dr Andy Galpin was with him</v>

823
00:19:23.551 --> 00:19:25.650
<v Speaker 3>for the week and I knew sugar was with me.</v>

824
00:19:25.651 --> 00:19:28.860
<v Speaker 3>He watched what the health and that's what turned him Vegan.</v>

825
00:19:28.861 --> 00:19:30.930
<v Speaker 3>So I made sure to ask doctor handy in front of sugar.</v>

826
00:19:30.931 --> 00:19:31.171
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

827
00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:36.171
<v Speaker 3>how much would Sean benefit from eating like elk or a grass fed meat twice a</v>

828
00:19:36.991 --> 00:19:37.201
<v Speaker 3>week.</v>

829
00:19:37.201 --> 00:19:38.550
<v Speaker 3>He's like fucking hugely,</v>

830
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.301
<v Speaker 3>hugely.</v>

831
00:19:39.301 --> 00:19:40.770
<v Speaker 3>And then Sean right there and made the decision,</v>

832
00:19:40.771 --> 00:19:42.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to start making some guys tell him if this,</v>

833
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.670
<v Speaker 3>if he's this smart and he's telling me that some good quality meats going to</v>

834
00:19:47.671 --> 00:19:48.540
<v Speaker 3>benefit me,</v>

835
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.270
<v Speaker 3>I would be stupid to not take him up on that and,</v>

836
00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.181
<v Speaker 3>and do that.</v>

837
00:19:54.181 --> 00:19:54.690
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

838
00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:55.411
<v Speaker 3>and I don't regret it.</v>

839
00:19:55.411 --> 00:19:56.730
<v Speaker 3>I feel so good eating meat again,</v>

840
00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.630
<v Speaker 3>I feel way stronger.</v>

841
00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:01.050
<v Speaker 4>It's hard when you see those documentary and also you get a lot of positive</v>

842
00:20:01.051 --> 00:20:03.930
<v Speaker 4>reinforcement from other vegans that are very happy that you're Vegan.</v>

843
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

844
00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.180
<v Speaker 4>they'd love that you joined the team and look,</v>

845
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.690
<v Speaker 4>people want to be healthy and for the most part,</v>

846
00:20:09.691 --> 00:20:11.490
<v Speaker 4>eating vegetables is very healthy.</v>

847
00:20:11.491 --> 00:20:12.340
<v Speaker 4>The problem is we,</v>

848
00:20:12.341 --> 00:20:16.080
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of nutrients that you're gonna really have to search for if you're</v>

849
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:18.360
<v Speaker 4>just eating plants and it's,</v>

850
00:20:18.361 --> 00:20:20.430
<v Speaker 4>the protein is not as bioavailable.</v>

851
00:20:20.431 --> 00:20:22.650
<v Speaker 4>The amino acids are not as bioavailable.</v>

852
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.320
<v Speaker 4>It's very hard to get vitamin B without supplementation.</v>

853
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:29.580
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of shit that you're just not going to get and they like bang for</v>

854
00:20:29.581 --> 00:20:33.990
<v Speaker 4>your buck in terms of what the amount of nutrients that you get in like a small</v>

855
00:20:33.991 --> 00:20:36.900
<v Speaker 4>grass fed steak versus a big plate of Broccoli.</v>

856
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.660
<v Speaker 4>It's just not the same and they don't want to admit it.</v>

857
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:40.520
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of these feelings,</v>

858
00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:40.681
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

859
00:20:40.681 --> 00:20:42.120
<v Speaker 4>I think those what the health guys,</v>

860
00:20:42.121 --> 00:20:45.900
<v Speaker 4>I had the mom when they did Cowspiracy I think they mean well but they are</v>

861
00:20:45.901 --> 00:20:47.860
<v Speaker 4>fucking true believers and they,</v>

862
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:52.660
<v Speaker 4>they are not trying to put together a documentary that states all the facts.</v>

863
00:20:52.661 --> 00:20:53.350
<v Speaker 4>Objective Lee,</v>

864
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:58.350
<v Speaker 4>they're doing a vegan propaganda film and on it debunked a shit load of the</v>

865
00:20:58.781 --> 00:20:59.231
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

866
00:20:59.231 --> 00:21:04.000
<v Speaker 4>We had an actual nutritionists analyze what they were saying,</v>

867
00:21:04.001 --> 00:21:07.660
<v Speaker 4>go over the studies and they debunked a shit load of what they put in that film.</v>

868
00:21:07.661 --> 00:21:11.260
<v Speaker 4>That film is propaganda film and it gets a lot of people thinking that this is</v>

869
00:21:11.261 --> 00:21:11.791
<v Speaker 4>the way to go.</v>

870
00:21:11.791 --> 00:21:14.230
<v Speaker 4>It's going to reverse heart disease and help your body and,</v>

871
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:19.030
<v Speaker 4>but they get so many things wrong deep into the meat does not cause diabetes.</v>

872
00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:22.630
<v Speaker 4>Like this is nonsense like that when they do these studies with people,</v>

873
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.050
<v Speaker 4>especially like um,</v>

874
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.870
<v Speaker 4>studies that they do on people that show that people that eat meat more than</v>

875
00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:31.510
<v Speaker 4>five times a week have a higher incidence of heart disease and all these</v>

876
00:21:31.511 --> 00:21:32.200
<v Speaker 4>different things.</v>

877
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.210
<v Speaker 4>They don't measure what else they eat.</v>

878
00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:38.410
<v Speaker 4>These people that are eating meat all the time or eating fries and shakes and</v>

879
00:21:38.411 --> 00:21:43.411
<v Speaker 4>soda and you're not analyzing someone who eats sauteed spinach and olive oil and</v>

880
00:21:45.041 --> 00:21:49.210
<v Speaker 4>a piece of grass fed beef or bison or elk or something like that.</v>

881
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:49.541
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

882
00:21:49.541 --> 00:21:49.751
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

883
00:21:49.751 --> 00:21:52.150
<v Speaker 4>you're getting some assholes eating Jack in the box.</v>

884
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:52.691
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

885
00:21:52.691 --> 00:21:52.901

00:21:52.901 --> 00:21:54.070
<v Speaker 4>that stuff's terrible for you.</v>

887
00:21:54.071 --> 00:21:58.900
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking sugar and refined carbohydrates and nonsense and trans fats.</v>

888
00:21:59.130 --> 00:21:59.231
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

00:21:59.231 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 4>that's those terrible for you.</v>

890
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:00.880
<v Speaker 4>If there's,</v>

891
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.480
<v Speaker 4>there's no studies that show that eating clean like people have eaten for</v>

892
00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:05.500
<v Speaker 4>thousands of years.</v>

893
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

894
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.840
<v Speaker 4>literally if me caused cancer,</v>

895
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.350
<v Speaker 4>97% of the planet would have cancer and that's,</v>

896
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.770
<v Speaker 4>that's the numbers that eat meat on a regular basis.</v>

897
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.080
<v Speaker 4>It's like 95 plus percent.</v>

898
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:17.830
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

899
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.420
<v Speaker 4>And then those people like that are vegans.</v>

900
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:19.690
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

901
00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:19.791
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

902
00:22:19.791 --> 00:22:20.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try a Vegan Diet.</v>

903
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:22.510
<v Speaker 4>And they're eating all these veggies,</v>

904
00:22:22.511 --> 00:22:24.370
<v Speaker 4>getting these nutrients that they didn't get before and they're like,</v>

905
00:22:24.371 --> 00:22:27.520
<v Speaker 4>I feel fucking kid off that bullshit diet.</v>

906
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:31.120
<v Speaker 4>He stopped beating Jack the Box Star Jack in the box in the middle of the night.</v>

907
00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:32.040
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I do go to,</v>

908
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:32.980
<v Speaker 4>as for comfort,</v>

909
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:35.030
<v Speaker 4>it's not Jack [inaudible],</v>

910
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:36.280
<v Speaker 4>he's just fast food,</v>

911
00:22:36.281 --> 00:22:37.061
<v Speaker 4>shitty food,</v>

912
00:22:37.061 --> 00:22:38.020
<v Speaker 4>processed food,</v>

913
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:38.560
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

914
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.760
<v Speaker 4>That's what the problem is.</v>

915
00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:40.481
<v Speaker 4>It's like people,</v>

916
00:22:40.481 --> 00:22:41.860
<v Speaker 4>like you're saying like ramen.</v>

917
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.360
<v Speaker 4>I like ramen every now and then.</v>

918
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:43.871
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

00:22:43.871 --> 00:22:44.704
<v Speaker 4>it tastes good,</v>

920
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.000
<v Speaker 4>but it's not good for you.</v>

921
00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:46.660
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't eat.</v>

922
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

923
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.400
<v Speaker 4>It's just like knowing what that,</v>

924
00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:51.920
<v Speaker 4>what that what it does do your by knowing that you are what you eat,</v>

925
00:22:51.921 --> 00:22:52.271
<v Speaker 4>it's high.</v>

926
00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:53.104
<v Speaker 4>Can't,</v>

927
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.220

<v Speaker 4>I can't do it.</v>

929
00:22:55.091 --> 00:22:55.691
<v Speaker 4>If I have no,</v>

930
00:22:55.691 --> 00:22:57.280
<v Speaker 4>that's not going to benefit my body.</v>

931
00:22:57.281 --> 00:22:58.090
<v Speaker 4>I can't eat it.</v>

932
00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:58.750
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

933
00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.450
<v Speaker 4>What you eat like 100% and I so simple.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's such a simple phrase,</v>

937
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.540
<v Speaker 4>but literally your body is made out of what you eat,</v>

938
00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:08.620
<v Speaker 4>not mouth.</v>

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.060
<v Speaker 3>And then you're like,</v>

1020
00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:04.820
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1021
00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:05.090
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1022
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.530
<v Speaker 3>that's not like who you like,</v>

1023
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:07.600
<v Speaker 3>it's such a common thing.</v>

1024
00:25:07.601 --> 00:25:09.550
<v Speaker 3>You are who you surround yourself with but people don't,</v>

1025
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:10.930
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

1026
00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:15.820
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm so lucky that when I was surrounded myself with Tim,</v>

1027
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:18.220
<v Speaker 3>like he introduced me to eating healthy.</v>

1028
00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.910
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I was 19 I moved to the lab every day.</v>

1029
00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.030
<v Speaker 3>We have pro practice Monday,</v>

1030
00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:25.030
<v Speaker 3>Tuesday,</v>

1031
00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:25.030
<v Speaker 3>Wednesday,</v>

1032
00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:25.030
<v Speaker 3>Thursday,</v>

1033
00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:25.360
<v Speaker 3>Saturday,</v>

1034
00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.230
<v Speaker 3>every day I was going to the coffee shop and reading mind gym books and meant</v>

1035
00:25:29.231 --> 00:25:31.760
<v Speaker 3>not like all these mental books and we're doing it together.</v>

1036
00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.690
<v Speaker 3>We were reading constantly improving each other,</v>

1037
00:25:34.691 --> 00:25:35.471
<v Speaker 3>wanting to get better,</v>

1038
00:25:35.471 --> 00:25:36.850
<v Speaker 3>want to do help each other improve.</v>

1039
00:25:36.851 --> 00:25:37.780
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

1040
00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.250
<v Speaker 3>it was so important for me to,</v>

1041
00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.670
<v Speaker 3>you are who you surround yourself with and I see people not surrounded with</v>

1042
00:25:42.671 --> 00:25:46.600
<v Speaker 3>themselves with the best people they can be around and to trap.</v>

1043
00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:46.991
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1044
00:25:46.991 --> 00:25:47.771
<v Speaker 4>it's a terrible trap.</v>

1045
00:25:47.771 --> 00:25:50.650
<v Speaker 4>But sometimes those people that are not the best people are really fun to be</v>

1046
00:25:50.651 --> 00:25:51.484
<v Speaker 4>around the problem.</v>

1047
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 3>That's a distraction.</v>

1048
00:25:53.661 --> 00:25:57.200
<v Speaker 3>It's like what's keeping you back from wanting to be the very like I want to be</v>

1049
00:25:57.201 --> 00:25:59.360
<v Speaker 3>the best Bantam weight in the world.</v>

1050
00:25:59.361 --> 00:26:02.080
<v Speaker 3>Like what's keeping you people back from wanting to be the best of them and</v>

1051
00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.050
<v Speaker 3>still just distractions.</v>

1052
00:26:03.051 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 3>People who are fun to be around alcohol,</v>

1053
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.121
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1054
00:26:05.121 --> 00:26:05.811
<v Speaker 3>even women,</v>

1055
00:26:05.811 --> 00:26:06.621
<v Speaker 3>like certain foods,</v>

1056
00:26:06.621 --> 00:26:09.650
<v Speaker 3>like distractions of what's keeping you back from wanting to be the best you.</v>

1057
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:13.130
<v Speaker 3>So it's just our brains are crazy.</v>

1058
00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.173
<v Speaker 3>Our brains are not.</v>

1059
00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:15.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1060
00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:15.761
<v Speaker 4>I mean just,</v>

1061
00:26:15.761 --> 00:26:18.400
<v Speaker 4>well you got to think about just what you do for a living.</v>

1062
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:19.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean just that alone is crazy,</v>

1063
00:26:19.871 --> 00:26:20.380
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1064
00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.660
<v Speaker 4>The desire to be a professional fighter,</v>

1065
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:27.220
<v Speaker 4>to desire to fucking kick people in the head and choke them and have them try to</v>

1066
00:26:27.221 --> 00:26:27.761
<v Speaker 4>do it to you.</v>

1067
00:26:27.761 --> 00:26:31.090
<v Speaker 4>And this is what excites you and that this is what's driving you to go to the</v>

1068
00:26:31.091 --> 00:26:32.980
<v Speaker 4>gym to improve constantly at,</v>

1069
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.671
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1070
00:26:33.671 --> 00:26:34.870
<v Speaker 4>that alone is crazy,</v>

1071
00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:35.471
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1072
00:26:35.471 --> 00:26:40.060
<v Speaker 4>And then these other people that are living their lives and drinking too much</v>

1073
00:26:40.061 --> 00:26:44.400
<v Speaker 4>and smoking too much and eating shitty foods and you know,</v>

1074
00:26:44.401 --> 00:26:44.731
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1075
00:26:44.731 --> 00:26:45.750
<v Speaker 4>that's their path.</v>

1076
00:26:45.751 --> 00:26:46.011
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1077
00:26:46.011 --> 00:26:48.270
<v Speaker 4>they're there but their path is not compatible with your</v>

1078
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.950
<v Speaker 2>path.</v>

1079
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:50.120
<v Speaker 2>That's the big key.</v>

1080
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.860
<v Speaker 2>I like how Kyle Kingsbury said like,</v>

1081
00:26:51.861 --> 00:26:52.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1082
00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:55.730
<v Speaker 2>like there's going to be some point in your life that Health Jermaine priority.</v>

1083
00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:58.730
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be some point when you're old and you have a disease or it</v>

1084
00:26:58.731 --> 00:26:59.331
<v Speaker 2>could be now,</v>

1085
00:26:59.331 --> 00:27:03.410
<v Speaker 2>but I was lucky enough to like when I was 20 and 21 learning these things,</v>

1086
00:27:03.411 --> 00:27:06.170
<v Speaker 2>I moved in with Robert Follis and got to live with him for a while and I was</v>

1087
00:27:06.171 --> 00:27:06.381
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1088
00:27:06.381 --> 00:27:07.190
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

1089
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.970
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker's got bookshelves of books,</v>

1090
00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:11.990
<v Speaker 2>super smart.</v>

1091
00:27:11.991 --> 00:27:12.351
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

1092
00:27:12.351 --> 00:27:13.161
<v Speaker 2>why is he eating all that?</v>

1093
00:27:13.161 --> 00:27:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Why does it go to this trader Joe's place?</v>

1094
00:27:14.551 --> 00:27:16.190
<v Speaker 2>So I started going to trader Joe's and I'm like,</v>

1095
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.450
<v Speaker 2>Robert Falls would always say,</v>

1096
00:27:17.451 --> 00:27:18.110
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

1097
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.280
<v Speaker 2>how much do you train your mind?</v>

1098
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:20.320
<v Speaker 2>We train Jujitsu,</v>

1099
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.901
<v Speaker 2>train wrestling,</v>

1100
00:27:20.901 --> 00:27:21.531
<v Speaker 2>we train all of this.</v>

1101
00:27:21.531 --> 00:27:23.450
<v Speaker 2>How much do you just sit there and train your mind?</v>

1102
00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:24.351
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1103
00:27:24.351 --> 00:27:25.010
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

1104
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:28.100
<v Speaker 2>So I just started reading books and started reading about eating healthy and</v>

1105
00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.950
<v Speaker 2>super lucky to learn and be around that guy.</v>

1106
00:27:30.951 --> 00:27:33.500
<v Speaker 2>He was probably one of the biggest influences in my life because I was raised</v>

1107
00:27:33.501 --> 00:27:36.530
<v Speaker 2>Jehovah's witness my whole life and he was raised Jehovah's witness his whole</v>

1108
00:27:36.531 --> 00:27:41.060
<v Speaker 2>life and I carried a lot of fucking guilt for not being in the like religion</v>

1109
00:27:41.061 --> 00:27:41.391
<v Speaker 2>slash,</v>

1110
00:27:41.391 --> 00:27:42.080
<v Speaker 2>cult.</v>

1111
00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:42.621
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

1112
00:27:42.621 --> 00:27:42.891
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1113
00:27:42.891 --> 00:27:44.720
<v Speaker 2>you're not a good person because of that religion.</v>

1114
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.261
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1115
00:27:45.261 --> 00:27:47.480
<v Speaker 2>you're a good person cause you're a fucking good person.</v>

1116
00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.810
<v Speaker 2>And then just started telling me to read and do your own research.</v>

1117
00:27:50.811 --> 00:27:51.680
<v Speaker 2>Don't listen to these people,</v>

1118
00:27:51.681 --> 00:27:52.970
<v Speaker 2>do your own fucking research.</v>

1119
00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Learned a lot from that guy and that they've got to pass it on to sugar.</v>

1120
00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:56.930
<v Speaker 2>He was a gem.</v>

1121
00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:57.861
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

1122
00:27:57.861 --> 00:27:58.730
<v Speaker 2>really loved that guy.</v>

1123
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.570
<v Speaker 4>Such a great guy to be around.</v>

1124
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:01.201
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1125
00:28:01.201 --> 00:28:02.130
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know him enough.</v>

1126
00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:02.820
<v Speaker 4>W you know,</v>

1127
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:03.870
<v Speaker 4>really when he died,</v>

1128
00:28:03.871 --> 00:28:04.920
<v Speaker 4>it bummed me out so much.</v>

1129
00:28:04.921 --> 00:28:05.250
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

1130
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:05.881
<v Speaker 4>God damn,</v>

1131
00:28:05.881 --> 00:28:07.340
<v Speaker 4>I should've spent more time with that guy.</v>

1132
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:08.370
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that crazy?</v>

1133
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:09.240
<v Speaker 2>It was the only got to meet him.</v>

1134
00:28:09.241 --> 00:28:10.950
<v Speaker 2>I only met him like three or four times,</v>

1135
00:28:10.951 --> 00:28:12.270
<v Speaker 2>but every time I was around him I was like,</v>

1136
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:15.620
<v Speaker 2>it was cool because he taught him so much and I get to learn.</v>

1137
00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.570
<v Speaker 2>I'd seen like that's where he learned it all from it.</v>

1138
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.020
<v Speaker 2>Like Robert's a smart dude.</v>

1139
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.561
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1140
00:28:19.561 --> 00:28:20.394
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

1141
00:28:20.450 --> 00:28:21.020
<v Speaker 4>Bummer.</v>

1142
00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.360
<v Speaker 4>You know a guy like that would want to end his own life.</v>

1143
00:28:23.361 --> 00:28:27.830
<v Speaker 4>Like how is that possible that someone was so loved and respected and</v>

1144
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:28.693
<v Speaker 4>appreciated?</v>

1145
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:30.230
<v Speaker 4>It really just highlights,</v>

1146
00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:31.011
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1147
00:28:31.011 --> 00:28:31.520
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1148
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:31.970
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1149
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.480
<v Speaker 4>the real issues that people who have mental illness and depression are going</v>

1150
00:28:35.481 --> 00:28:35.841
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>

1151
00:28:35.841 --> 00:28:36.051
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1152
00:28:36.051 --> 00:28:36.884
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's not,</v>

1153
00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:38.960
<v Speaker 4>it's not obvious to people on the outside.</v>

1154
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:39.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1155
00:28:39.421 --> 00:28:40.400
<v Speaker 2>And I think I know what someone's,</v>

1156
00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.290
<v Speaker 2>you just never know how someone's feeling or thing.</v>

1157
00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:42.600
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1158
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.680
<v Speaker 2>his brother committed suicide and I think that's what made him start like maybe</v>

1159
00:28:46.681 --> 00:28:48.330
<v Speaker 2>getting into pills or alcohol and stuff.</v>

1160
00:28:48.331 --> 00:28:51.990
<v Speaker 2>But it was weird because he would always be the one that the answer for you to</v>

1161
00:28:51.991 --> 00:28:52.650
<v Speaker 2>wear your problems.</v>

1162
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:53.730
<v Speaker 2>You have the perfect answer,</v>

1163
00:28:53.731 --> 00:28:54.630
<v Speaker 2>super intelligent.</v>

1164
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.250
<v Speaker 2>So it kind of freaked me out.</v>

1165
00:28:56.251 --> 00:28:56.521
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1166
00:28:56.521 --> 00:28:56.701
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1167
00:28:56.701 --> 00:28:57.120
<v Speaker 2>I want to,</v>

1168
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.410
<v Speaker 2>I want my life to be like that guy.</v>

1169
00:28:58.411 --> 00:28:59.630
<v Speaker 2>I want to be like him when I grow up.</v>

1170
00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:00.301
<v Speaker 2>When that happened,</v>

1171
00:29:00.301 --> 00:29:00.750
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1172
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:01.590
<v Speaker 2>fuck man,</v>

1173
00:29:01.591 --> 00:29:02.424
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't believe it.</v>

1174
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.320
<v Speaker 2>How did you get out of Jehovah's witness?</v>

1175
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1176
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.260
<v Speaker 2>my parents got divorced in eighth grade.</v>

1177
00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:08.150
<v Speaker 2>My mom moved to Canada,</v>

1178
00:29:08.151 --> 00:29:10.160
<v Speaker 2>was still a Jehovah's Witness and uh,</v>

1179
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.990
<v Speaker 2>I lived with her for a while and I just was super trapped,</v>

1180
00:29:12.991 --> 00:29:14.130
<v Speaker 2>couldn't hang out with anyone,</v>

1181
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:15.750
<v Speaker 2>couldn't do any sports.</v>

1182
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:16.861
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1183
00:29:16.861 --> 00:29:17.311
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

1184
00:29:17.311 --> 00:29:18.450
<v Speaker 2>I have to make a decision.</v>

1185
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Go with my dad and get out of the cult.</v>

1186
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.260
<v Speaker 2>And all the elders were like,</v>

1187
00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:22.831
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>

1188
00:29:22.831 --> 00:29:23.521
<v Speaker 2>That's a mistake.</v>

1189
00:29:23.521 --> 00:29:24.121
<v Speaker 2>That's a mistake.</v>

1190
00:29:24.121 --> 00:29:24.990
<v Speaker 2>But I made decisions.</v>

1191
00:29:24.991 --> 00:29:25.771
<v Speaker 2>They have elders too,</v>

1192
00:29:25.771 --> 00:29:27.490
<v Speaker 2>just like the Mormons and I'm,</v>

1193
00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.880
<v Speaker 2>and I made the decision I'm going to go move with my dad and moved back to</v>

1194
00:29:29.881 --> 00:29:30.391
<v Speaker 2>Montana.</v>

1195
00:29:30.391 --> 00:29:32.460
<v Speaker 2>And then my dad was super into UFC,</v>

1196
00:29:32.461 --> 00:29:34.620
<v Speaker 2>so I started wrestling and boxing when I was 14.</v>

1197
00:29:34.621 --> 00:29:35.850
<v Speaker 2>And then on from there,</v>

1198
00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:36.901

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.220
<v Speaker 5>Can you believe they're going to fight again?</v>

1246
00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:58.990
<v Speaker 5>Are they getting along again?</v>

1247
00:30:58.991 --> 00:31:00.910
<v Speaker 5>Chuck and Tito are supposed to be fighting again.</v>

1261
00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.130
<v Speaker 5>I think Bella tours cautious.</v>

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:21.701
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1263

1264
00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:25.390
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

1265
00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:30.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean Dana White said it best is a reason I asked him to retire 10 years ago,</v>

1266
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.020
<v Speaker 5>10 years ago.</v>

00:31:53.801 --> 00:31:56.800
<v Speaker 5>Tito is in remarkably good shape.</v>

1288
00:31:56.801 --> 00:31:57.550
<v Speaker 5>Believe it or not,</v>

1289

1290
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.800
<v Speaker 5>but other than the chocolate Dell fights,</v>

1291
00:32:02.801 --> 00:32:04.700
<v Speaker 5>he really didn't take a lot of headshots.</v>

1292
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.380
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1293

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1296
00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.470
<v Speaker 5>Tito's a tough motherfucker,</v>

1297
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:10.721
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1298
00:32:10.721 --> 00:32:11.554

1300
00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:15.400

1301
00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:18.730
<v Speaker 5>the gap in striking was just so large.</v>

1302
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:19.091
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1303
00:32:19.091 --> 00:32:20.020
<v Speaker 5>Tito was always,</v>

1304
00:32:20.021 --> 00:32:20.630
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1305
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.390
<v Speaker 5>a competent striker.</v>

1306
00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:22.691
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1307
00:32:22.691 --> 00:32:25.840
<v Speaker 5>he was a strong guy and a great wrestler in his ground and pound,</v>

1308
00:32:25.841 --> 00:32:26.710
<v Speaker 5>but some of the best,</v>

1309
00:32:26.711 --> 00:32:27.370
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1310
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:30.070
<v Speaker 5>Tito was one of those guys never bothered passing the guard.</v>

1311
00:32:30.071 --> 00:32:30.521
<v Speaker 5>He was like,</v>

1312
00:32:30.521 --> 00:32:32.530
<v Speaker 5>fuck you and fuck your guard.</v>

1313
00:32:32.531 --> 00:32:33.030
<v Speaker 5>Teen quest.</v>

1314
00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:35.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to get on top of you and smash you.</v>

1315
00:32:35.741 --> 00:32:39.680
<v Speaker 5>And there was nobody catching Tito Ortiz and triangles get the fuck Outta here</v>

1316
00:32:39.681 --> 00:32:40.310
<v Speaker 5>with that.</v>

1317
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:42.470
<v Speaker 6>You were getting elbowed and punched in the face.</v>

1318
00:32:42.471 --> 00:32:43.910
<v Speaker 6>He was phenomenal at that.</v>

1319
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.750
<v Speaker 6>But his standup could not hang with chuck.</v>

1320
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:48.680
<v Speaker 6>Chuck,</v>

1321
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 6>when you think of chuck stand up like it was never like,</v>

1322
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.090
<v Speaker 6>but it was beautiful and a lot of ways because of the knock outs were</v>

1323
00:32:56.091 --> 00:32:56.811
<v Speaker 6>spectacular,</v>

1324
00:32:56.811 --> 00:32:57.530
<v Speaker 6>but it was,</v>

1325
00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:57.950
<v Speaker 6>there was,</v>

1326
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.210
<v Speaker 6>it was not sneaky.</v>

1327
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.290
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1328
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:02.000
<v Speaker 6>There was no artistry to it.</v>

1329
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:07.001
<v Speaker 6>There was no faints or swell is no like Tj Dillashaw style movement or Dominick</v>

1330
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:12.540
<v Speaker 6>Cruz or it was just a tag viking.</v>

1331
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.980
<v Speaker 6>Ah,</v>

1332
00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.810
<v Speaker 6>just smash people and skillful,</v>

1333
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:18.651
<v Speaker 6>don't get me wrong.</v>

1334
00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:19.161
<v Speaker 6>It was a very,</v>

1335
00:33:19.161 --> 00:33:19.790
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1336
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:20.001
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

1337
00:33:20.001 --> 00:33:20.510
<v Speaker 6>he,</v>

1338
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.900
<v Speaker 6>he fucked up a lot of really good guys with solid technique,</v>

1339
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:27.440
<v Speaker 6>but it was just so overtly aggressive.</v>

1340
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:31.670
<v Speaker 6>Like his style was so aggressive that that style just caught up with him.</v>

1341
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:32.421
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1342
00:33:32.421 --> 00:33:32.991
<v Speaker 6>he's got,</v>

1343
00:33:32.991 --> 00:33:34.610
<v Speaker 6>he was in so many wars,</v>

1344
00:33:34.611 --> 00:33:35.300
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1345
00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:35.780
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1346
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.240
<v Speaker 6>just so many fucking crazy wars.</v>

1347
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:39.500
<v Speaker 6>It's weird the confidence,</v>

1348
00:33:39.501 --> 00:33:40.334
<v Speaker 6>like you see like,</v>

1349
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:41.660
<v Speaker 6>it's so good.</v>

1350
00:33:41.661 --> 00:33:44.870
<v Speaker 6>I feel like when someone knocks people out early on in their career and they're</v>

1351
00:33:44.871 --> 00:33:45.021
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1352
00:33:45.021 --> 00:33:45.854
<v Speaker 6>oh shit man,</v>

1353
00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:47.330
<v Speaker 6>I fucking touches guy.</v>

1354
00:33:47.331 --> 00:33:48.830
<v Speaker 6>He's gonna fall sugars,</v>

1355
00:33:48.831 --> 00:33:51.530
<v Speaker 6>knock someone out with every limb on his body.</v>

1356
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:52.400
<v Speaker 6>So it's like,</v>

1357
00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.800
<v Speaker 6>he knows he can touch this guy with any limb and what they do,</v>

1358
00:33:55.801 --> 00:33:57.020
<v Speaker 6>what they fucking fall over.</v>

1359
00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.060
<v Speaker 6>And I think a lot of people late in their career,</v>

1360
00:33:59.061 --> 00:34:00.360
<v Speaker 6>they'd never knocked him out.</v>

1361
00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:01.970
<v Speaker 6>They don't believe that at all.</v>

1362
00:34:01.971 --> 00:34:05.630
<v Speaker 6>And I feel like you can see that big time and fight or a wrestler knocks him out</v>

1363
00:34:05.631 --> 00:34:06.680
<v Speaker 6>for the first time and then you're like,</v>

1364
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:07.011
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

1365
00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:09.440
<v Speaker 6>addicted Johnny Hendricks style.</v>

1366
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:10.041
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1367
00:34:10.041 --> 00:34:15.041
<v Speaker 6>Well Hendrix for a while had some magic power in his hands.</v>

1368
00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:16.550
<v Speaker 6>It was weird,</v>

1369
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.950
<v Speaker 6>but it's weird is that it went away.</v>

1370
00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:20.450
<v Speaker 6>It didn't make any sense.</v>

1371
00:34:20.451 --> 00:34:24.380
<v Speaker 6>If you see like his fight with Martin Kampmann or his fight with Fitch or a lot</v>

1372
00:34:24.381 --> 00:34:25.214
<v Speaker 6>of the guys he fought,</v>

1373
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:30.430
<v Speaker 6>he would just fucking one touch these guys and they would fly across the cage.</v>

1374
00:34:30.921 --> 00:34:32.480
<v Speaker 6>Like he had magic in his hands.</v>

1375
00:34:32.481 --> 00:34:34.490
<v Speaker 6>Luck Dude Hendricks for a while.</v>

1376
00:34:34.491 --> 00:34:34.611
<v Speaker 6>Man,</v>

1377
00:34:34.611 --> 00:34:36.170
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if he got injured,</v>

1378
00:34:36.171 --> 00:34:37.790
<v Speaker 6>if his shoulder got fucked up,</v>

1379
00:34:37.791 --> 00:34:41.480
<v Speaker 6>if he couldn't throw the way he used to be able to throw whatever it was.</v>

1380
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:43.400
<v Speaker 6>You saw the whatever it was,</v>

1381
00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.061
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

1382
00:34:44.061 --> 00:34:44.870
<v Speaker 6>Got them,</v>

1383
00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:45.681
<v Speaker 6>whatever got them.</v>

1384
00:34:45.681 --> 00:34:48.770
<v Speaker 6>He motivation time,</v>

1385
00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.850
<v Speaker 6>just father time,</v>

1386
00:34:49.851 --> 00:34:50.684
<v Speaker 6>whatever it was.</v>

1387
00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:55.460
<v Speaker 6>But God damn it just went away and then he became not a dangerous striker.</v>

1388
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:56.800
<v Speaker 6>It's so weird.</v>

1389
00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:57.771
<v Speaker 6>Fucking weird.</v>

1390
00:34:57.771 --> 00:35:01.430
<v Speaker 6>And that's another thing like whether it's Usada or whether they're using those</v>

1391
00:35:01.431 --> 00:35:01.980
<v Speaker 6>losses.</v>

1392
00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:03.860
<v Speaker 6>There's informative or demoralizing.</v>

1393
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:04.191
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1394
00:35:04.191 --> 00:35:06.980
<v Speaker 6>we all know everyone who has been around,</v>

1395
00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.220
<v Speaker 6>Jim's knows things that have not been published.</v>

1396
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:12.290
<v Speaker 6>We know people that have not been caught,</v>

1397
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:17.090
<v Speaker 6>but we've seen them dip significantly when they had to go off a cycle because</v>

1398
00:35:17.091 --> 00:35:19.640
<v Speaker 6>they're going to a place where they were going to get tested regularly.</v>

1399
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:20.510
<v Speaker 6>We've all seen it.</v>

1400
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:20.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1401
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.591
<v Speaker 6>and it's,</v>

1402
00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:23.450
<v Speaker 6>these are stories that like you hesitate,</v>

1403
00:35:23.451 --> 00:35:28.130
<v Speaker 6>like should the general public understand what the real risks are because these</v>

1404
00:35:28.131 --> 00:35:29.420
<v Speaker 6>fighters that go to,</v>

1405
00:35:29.421 --> 00:35:32.090
<v Speaker 6>would you say you go to someplace like rise in and they're like,</v>

1406
00:35:32.091 --> 00:35:32.480
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

1407
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.530

1408
00:35:33.531 --> 00:35:34.190
<v Speaker 6>We don't give a f.</v>

1409
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:36.620
<v Speaker 6>You want to give a fuck old school pride go crazy.</v>

1410
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:37.603
<v Speaker 6>We don't give a fuck.</v>

1411
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.130
<v Speaker 6>But then</v>

1412
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:42.660
<v Speaker 5>when those guys come over and try to compete in the UFC and the UFC is like,</v>

1413
00:35:42.661 --> 00:35:43.170
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1414
00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:44.640
<v Speaker 5>fill out this paperwork.</v>

1415
00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:44.901
<v Speaker 5>It gets,</v>

1416
00:35:44.901 --> 00:35:45.151

1419
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.690
<v Speaker 5>And then they start showing up.</v>

1420
00:35:49.691 --> 00:35:52.620
<v Speaker 5>When someone like Holly Holmes had been tested like 19 times,</v>

1421
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:53.581
<v Speaker 5>they just show up.</v>

1422
00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:53.821
<v Speaker 5>Knock,</v>

1423
00:35:53.821 --> 00:35:54.840
<v Speaker 5>knock here.</v>

1424
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:55.703
<v Speaker 5>Time to pee.</v>

1425
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:56.190
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1426
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:56.510
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>

1427
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:57.390
<v Speaker 5>let's check your blood.</v>

1428
00:35:57.391 --> 00:35:58.710
<v Speaker 5>Let's see what's going on in your body.</v>

1429
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:00.060
<v Speaker 5>I'll make sure you're not doing anything stupid.</v>

1430
00:36:00.061 --> 00:36:00.271
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

1431
00:36:00.271 --> 00:36:01.104
<v Speaker 5>go back to sleep.</v>

1432
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.250
<v Speaker 5>I mean you,</v>

1433
00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:07.050
<v Speaker 5>if you come from this place where you're allowed to cheat basically,</v>

1434
00:36:07.051 --> 00:36:08.040
<v Speaker 5>and you're doing it all the time,</v>

1435
00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:11.490
<v Speaker 5>which we all know a lot of organizations,</v>

1436
00:36:11.491 --> 00:36:15.030
<v Speaker 5>I'll allow that to happen and then you could try to come over to the UFC.</v>

1437
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.710
<v Speaker 5>You're going to see depression,</v>

1438
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:18.330
<v Speaker 5>you're going to see lethargic,</v>

1439
00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.240
<v Speaker 5>you're going to see people that they're just there.</v>

1440
00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.200
<v Speaker 5>They're in a dour mood all the time.</v>

1441
00:36:22.201 --> 00:36:23.280
<v Speaker 5>They're always sad,</v>

1442
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.870
<v Speaker 5>their body's broken down.</v>

1443

1471
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:57.990

1472
00:36:57.991 --> 00:36:58.680
<v Speaker 5>so when you fight,</v>

1473
00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:58.921

1475
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:00.031
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't find,</v>

1476
00:37:00.031 --> 00:37:00.390
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

1477
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:01.150
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>

1478
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:02.760
<v Speaker 5>How long ago was that in August.</v>

1479
00:37:02.761 --> 00:37:06.570
<v Speaker 5>The fucking first punch of the fight broke it clean,</v>

1480
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:08.570
<v Speaker 5>still went into the second round.</v>

1481
00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.630
<v Speaker 5>I was trying to finish him,</v>

1482
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.300
<v Speaker 5>trying to put them away because I knew if I win one more I'll get back in the</v>

1483
00:37:12.301 --> 00:37:13.134
<v Speaker 5>UFC.</v>

1484
00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.220
<v Speaker 5>So that was a tough one.</v>

1485
00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:15.200
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>

1486
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:15.390
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1487
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:16.530
<v Speaker 5>it forced me to meditate.</v>

1488
00:37:16.531 --> 00:37:17.040
<v Speaker 5>It forced me.</v>

1489
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:21.090
<v Speaker 5>I would have my jaw wired fucking tight shut for eight weeks and I couldn't talk</v>

1490
00:37:21.091 --> 00:37:23.160
<v Speaker 5>because my TMJ joint would flare up.</v>

1491
00:37:23.161 --> 00:37:25.450
<v Speaker 5>So I'd have like bad headaches.</v>

1492
00:37:25.451 --> 00:37:27.540
<v Speaker 5>So I'd had to sit in my chair and I'm like,</v>

1493
00:37:27.541 --> 00:37:27.811
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1494
00:37:27.811 --> 00:37:28.860
<v Speaker 5>I have to do this.</v>

1495
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:30.000
<v Speaker 5>So I just read,</v>

1496
00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.740
<v Speaker 5>started meditating and I'm like,</v>

1497
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:32.603
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1498
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:37.620
<v Speaker 5>you just suck liquid through your teeth every day,</v>

1499
00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:38.370
<v Speaker 5>all day.</v>

1500
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:39.360
<v Speaker 5>I remember when I hurt my foot,</v>

1501
00:37:39.361 --> 00:37:40.194
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1502
00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:43.920
<v Speaker 5>we were in the ambulance going to the breath to us by going into the hospital.</v>

1503
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:45.960
<v Speaker 5>And I remember thinking this could be worse.</v>

1504
00:37:45.961 --> 00:37:48.090
<v Speaker 5>I could have my mouth and hanging off of me.</v>

1505
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.710
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is it happens man.</v>

1506
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:50.800
<v Speaker 5>Er Guy,</v>

1507
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.010
<v Speaker 5>there was no one in the year and they're like you need to let the inflammation</v>

1508
00:37:53.011 --> 00:37:53.311
<v Speaker 5>go down.</v>

1509
00:37:53.311 --> 00:37:56.400
<v Speaker 5>So I had to go two days and drive to another city with it hanging off.</v>

1510
00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:57.683
<v Speaker 5>But like I said,</v>

1511
00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:58.980
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't trade it.</v>

1512
00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:02.340
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't take it away cause I started meditating and now sugar is meditating</v>

1513
00:38:02.341 --> 00:38:02.881
<v Speaker 5>and man,</v>

1514
00:38:02.881 --> 00:38:04.950
<v Speaker 5>we've gotten so much fucking benefits from that.</v>

1515
00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:05.940
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

1516
00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.170
<v Speaker 5>Even now we're built on it.</v>

1517
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:07.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:50.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean on stuff do it.</v>

1587
00:39:50.141 --> 00:39:54.010
<v Speaker 5>It's hard when you eat milk before bed and you wake up hard as rob won the fuck</v>

1588
00:39:54.011 --> 00:39:54.844
<v Speaker 5>people up.</v>

1589
00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.190
<v Speaker 5>People don't know</v>

1590
00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.830
<v Speaker 5>the super athlete.</v>

1591
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:00.670
<v Speaker 5>If you eat elk,</v>

1592
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.870
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1593
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:02.710
<v Speaker 5>you're literally eat a super athlete.</v>

1594
00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:05.800
<v Speaker 5>You know it's bad ass like another reason,</v>

1595
00:40:05.801 --> 00:40:06.970
<v Speaker 5>not just a doctor Andy,</v>

1596
00:40:06.971 --> 00:40:08.000
<v Speaker 5>but listening to you.</v>

1597
00:40:08.001 --> 00:40:10.060
<v Speaker 5>You talk about it because it's in your podcast all the time.</v>

1598
00:40:10.061 --> 00:40:12.880
<v Speaker 5>Talk about how how beneficial eaten those kinds of meats are.</v>

1599
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:14.223
<v Speaker 5>And I'm just like,</v>

1600
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.561
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

1601
00:40:14.561 --> 00:40:15.281
<v Speaker 5>I got to do it.</v>

1602
00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:16.114
<v Speaker 5>And I would just,</v>

1603
00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:16.510
<v Speaker 5>I feel,</v>

1604
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:18.040
<v Speaker 5>I feel so much better doing it.</v>

1605
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.491
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1606
00:40:18.491 --> 00:40:21.910
<v Speaker 5>if you think about like how healthy it is to eat salmon,</v>

1607
00:40:21.911 --> 00:40:24.340
<v Speaker 5>like a healthy wild salmon,</v>

1608
00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.270
<v Speaker 5>that is a,</v>

1609
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.610
<v Speaker 5>an animal that's out there hustling,</v>

1610
00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:28.301
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1611
00:40:28.301 --> 00:40:30.420
<v Speaker 5>Sam and making its way up river,</v>

1612
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:31.360
<v Speaker 5>you eat one of those things.</v>

1613
00:40:31.361 --> 00:40:34.630
<v Speaker 5>It's just loaded with nutrients and essential fats.</v>

1614
00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.700
<v Speaker 5>When you eat an elk man,</v>

1615
00:40:36.701 --> 00:40:41.140
<v Speaker 5>you're eating an animal that's getting away from wolves and bears and fighting</v>

1616
00:40:41.141 --> 00:40:43.540
<v Speaker 5>to the death with swords grown out of its head.</v>

1617
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.261
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1618
00:40:44.261 --> 00:40:49.261
<v Speaker 5>literally it's a forest horse with fucking spears grown out of its head and</v>

1619
00:40:49.331 --> 00:40:52.090
<v Speaker 5>they're just out there hustling serious day.</v>

1620
00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:52.540
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1621
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.520
<v Speaker 5>living out in Montana in the winter,</v>

1622
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:55.870
<v Speaker 5>in the middle of the fucking winter,</v>

1623
00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.880
<v Speaker 5>running from wolves and shit.</v>

1624
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:58.091
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1625
00:40:58.091 --> 00:40:58.924
<v Speaker 5>that's their life.</v>

1626
00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:00.490
<v Speaker 5>You eat one of those things you eat.</v>

1627
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:00.910
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1628
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:03.550
<v Speaker 5>Oh fuck you get charged up.</v>

1629
00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.010
<v Speaker 5>It feels,</v>

1630
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:07.930
<v Speaker 5>I've given it to people who've never eaten it before and they're like,</v>

1631
00:41:07.931 --> 00:41:08.830
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

1632
00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:09.280
<v Speaker 5>And My,</v>

1633
00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:09.640
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

1634
00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.600
<v Speaker 5>you feel different,</v>

1635
00:41:10.601 --> 00:41:11.200
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1636
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:14.080
<v Speaker 5>You feel like even their DNA.</v>

1637
00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.910
<v Speaker 5>Do you ever do listen to Paul Chek?</v>

1638
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.201
<v Speaker 5>Paul Chek,</v>

1639
00:41:17.201 --> 00:41:18.670
<v Speaker 5>he's the [inaudible] Guy,</v>

1640
00:41:18.671 --> 00:41:19.420
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1641
00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:20.021
<v Speaker 5>Isn't ain't no.</v>

1642
00:41:20.021 --> 00:41:21.250
<v Speaker 5>He's been on Aubrey's and stuff.</v>

1643
00:41:21.251 --> 00:41:22.150
<v Speaker 5>He's a no,</v>

1644
00:41:22.151 --> 00:41:24.610
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking of Paul Vernac thinking of different guy.</v>

1645
00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:25.121
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1646
00:41:25.121 --> 00:41:26.410
<v Speaker 5>I've have listened to Paul Chek.</v>

1647
00:41:26.411 --> 00:41:27.830
<v Speaker 5>I listened to him on Arbery's punch.</v>

1648
00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:28.620
<v Speaker 5>That's amazing.</v>

1649
00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:29.080
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1650
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:29.351
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

1651
00:41:29.351 --> 00:41:30.040
<v Speaker 5>He's a wizard.</v>

1652
00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.130
<v Speaker 5>He was explaining how a pasture raised eggs,</v>

1653
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:38.890
<v Speaker 5>just regular eggs that were literally eating the DNA of that chicken and it was</v>

1654
00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:39.170
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

1655
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:40.340
<v Speaker 5>I don't remember what exactly he said,</v>

1656
00:41:40.341 --> 00:41:41.360
<v Speaker 5>but it blew my mind.</v>

1657
00:41:41.361 --> 00:41:42.194
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1658
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:43.101
<v Speaker 5>he's awesome.</v>

1659
00:41:43.101 --> 00:41:43.430
<v Speaker 5>He would.</v>

1660
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.880
<v Speaker 5>That'd be,</v>

1661
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.301
<v Speaker 5>that'd be good.</v>

1662
00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:45.111
<v Speaker 5>Podcasting on him.</v>

1663
00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:45.890
<v Speaker 5>That would be sweet.</v>

1664
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:47.840
<v Speaker 5>I'd have him on for sure would be so sweet.</v>

1665
00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.093
<v Speaker 5>Chickens.</v>

1666
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:54.250
<v Speaker 5>They love to eat bugs and worms and grass and they will love to roam around.</v>

1667
00:41:54.441 --> 00:41:56.000
<v Speaker 5>And if they are allowed to do that,</v>

1668
00:41:56.030 --> 00:42:00.800
<v Speaker 5>they get a dark like an orange yolk that you just don't get from those God damn</v>

1669
00:42:00.801 --> 00:42:01.481
<v Speaker 5>grocery store,</v>

1670
00:42:01.481 --> 00:42:01.720
<v Speaker 5>eggs,</v>

1671
00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.121
<v Speaker 5>chickens,</v>

1672
00:42:02.121 --> 00:42:06.440
<v Speaker 5>those grocery store chickens are prisoners getting little prisoner eggs eaten</v>

1673
00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:08.060
<v Speaker 5>that putting it into your body,</v>

1674
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.680
<v Speaker 5>it's better than nothing.</v>

1675
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:14.680
<v Speaker 5>But it's nothing like a farm raised free range chicken,</v>

1676
00:42:14.781 --> 00:42:14.931
<v Speaker 5>egg.</v>

1677
00:42:14.931 --> 00:42:17.400
<v Speaker 5>And you could get those at farmer's markets and stuff like that like,</v>

1678
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.610
<v Speaker 5>but you could tell the moment you crack them open.</v>

1679
00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.470
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's just orange,</v>

1680
00:42:21.471 --> 00:42:22.400
<v Speaker 5>like the sun,</v>

1681
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:23.150
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1682
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:24.140
<v Speaker 5>take care of your chickens.</v>

1683
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.411
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1684
00:42:24.411 --> 00:42:25.244
<v Speaker 5>y'all have,</v>

1685
00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.660
<v Speaker 5>what's that?</v>

1686
00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:27.493
<v Speaker 5>Are they a pain?</v>

1687
00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.170
<v Speaker 5>It's not the easiest thing really.</v>

1688
00:42:30.171 --> 00:42:30.531
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1689
00:42:30.531 --> 00:42:30.891
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1690
00:42:30.891 --> 00:42:33.990
<v Speaker 5>You got to clean the shit and you got to make sure they have enough food.</v>

1691
00:42:33.991 --> 00:42:34.431
<v Speaker 5>And for me,</v>

1692
00:42:34.431 --> 00:42:35.720
<v Speaker 5>I got a squirrel problem.</v>

1693
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.360
<v Speaker 5>My wife wants to kill the fuck at squirrels.</v>

1694
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.631
<v Speaker 5>Me.</v>

1695
00:42:38.631 --> 00:42:40.560
<v Speaker 5>I'm like they're cute little fellas,</v>

1696
00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:40.791
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1697
00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:42.200
<v Speaker 5>But they steal all the food.</v>

1698
00:42:42.201 --> 00:42:45.440
<v Speaker 5>They're fat fucking squirrels cause they keep figuring out a way to get into the</v>

1699
00:42:45.441 --> 00:42:48.560
<v Speaker 5>chicken coop and get all the chicken food and they're just in there all the</v>

1700
00:42:48.561 --> 00:42:48.741
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1701
00:42:48.741 --> 00:42:52.010
<v Speaker 5>But now I might have to put them to death because I found out they'd been</v>

1702
00:42:52.011 --> 00:42:52.880
<v Speaker 5>stealing eggs.</v>

1703
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:55.760
<v Speaker 5>The squirrels have now figured out that they can get eggs.</v>

1704
00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:00.470
<v Speaker 5>And so a squirrel was trying to roll an egg out of the chicken coop through the</v>

1705
00:43:00.471 --> 00:43:01.730
<v Speaker 5>hole that he comes in.</v>

1706
00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.690
<v Speaker 5>We caught him doing that.</v>

1707
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:03.583
<v Speaker 5>I didn't catch him.</v>

1708
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:05.000
<v Speaker 5>Catch him.</v>

1709
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.440
<v Speaker 5>How are you going to get a little fucker?</v>

1710
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:07.340
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno.</v>

1711
00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:08.293
<v Speaker 5>I Dunno.</v>

1712
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.950
<v Speaker 5>I bet it feels good.</v>

1713
00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:10.630
<v Speaker 5>I've never,</v>

1714
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:12.410
<v Speaker 5>I never hunted and uh,</v>

1715
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.770
<v Speaker 5>but it feels good shooting and then eating the meat you get.</v>

1716
00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:16.540
<v Speaker 5>It does.</v>

1717
00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:20.450
<v Speaker 5>I'm nervous though because I feel like I'd feel so guilty shooting an animal.</v>

1718
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.170
<v Speaker 5>You will.</v>

1719
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.760
<v Speaker 5>I remember I shot up there a little bit longer.</v>

1720
00:43:22.761 --> 00:43:23.081
<v Speaker 5>Look at him.</v>

1721
00:43:23.081 --> 00:43:23.914
<v Speaker 5>He's got an egg.</v>

1722
00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:25.100
<v Speaker 5>That's yours.</v>

1723
00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:25.350
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1724
00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:25.770
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

1725
00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:27.290
<v Speaker 5>I'll pull that back.</v>

1726
00:43:27.291 --> 00:43:27.890
<v Speaker 5>Jamie.</v>

1727
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:28.101
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

1728
00:43:28.101 --> 00:43:29.960
<v Speaker 5>I had no idea that squirrel's did this.</v>

1729
00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.790
<v Speaker 5>I had to find out on my own yard.</v>

1730
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.800
<v Speaker 5>These little faces.</v>

1731
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:34.971
<v Speaker 5>Their egg Steelers,</v>

1732
00:43:34.971 --> 00:43:35.480
<v Speaker 5>Bro.</v>

1733
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:35.960
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

1734
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.010
<v Speaker 5>how do they know?</v>

1735
00:43:37.011 --> 00:43:37.850
<v Speaker 5>How do they know?</v>

1736
00:43:37.851 --> 00:43:38.690
<v Speaker 5>They're so cute.</v>

1737
00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:39.770
<v Speaker 5>They're so cute.</v>

1738
00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:40.760
<v Speaker 5>How do they know?</v>

1739
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:45.510
<v Speaker 5>They fucking know at times a little motherfucker.</v>

1740
00:43:45.511 --> 00:43:46.370
<v Speaker 5>You got the chickens.</v>

1741
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:49.100
<v Speaker 5>Chickens don't know what to do but it's bloody.</v>

1742
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1743
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:52.760
<v Speaker 5>Squirrels or they're not smart but they're determined.</v>

1744
00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.490
<v Speaker 5>I think I might have to run a fucking Arrow through a few of them.</v>

1745
00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:56.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1746
00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.460
<v Speaker 5>but I don't want to kill the squirrels.</v>

1747
00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.230
<v Speaker 5>That's the city.</v>

1748
00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:01.190
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't want them eating my eggs,</v>

1749
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:04.910
<v Speaker 5>but I also don't want to kill them so I don't know what to do.</v>

1750
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:09.770
<v Speaker 5>I know it's like they have one last way to block off their holes but they keep</v>

1751
00:44:09.771 --> 00:44:11.000
<v Speaker 5>opening new holes.</v>

1752
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:11.671
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

1753
00:44:11.671 --> 00:44:12.500
<v Speaker 5>Cause what this guy did?</v>

1754
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.940
<v Speaker 5>He made a protector boxers.</v>

1755
00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:14.803
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1756
00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:17.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure we're doing just like my brother and my brother says though,</v>

1757
00:44:17.691 --> 00:44:17.931
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1758
00:44:17.931 --> 00:44:18.410
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

1759
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:19.490
<v Speaker 5>if you're hunting and you're,</v>

1760
00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:20.960
<v Speaker 5>you're a really good shot,</v>

1761
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:23.330
<v Speaker 5>you're going to put that thing away and it didn't even know it died.</v>

1762
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:24.590
<v Speaker 5>It lived a great life.</v>

1763
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:25.730
<v Speaker 5>I home,</v>

1764
00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:27.660
<v Speaker 5>it's done and you to meet like,</v>

1765
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:28.281
<v Speaker 5>listen man,</v>

1766
00:44:28.281 --> 00:44:29.870
<v Speaker 5>that's the best case scenario.</v>

1767
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:31.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1768
00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:31.801
<v Speaker 5>Here's the thing though,</v>

1769
00:44:31.801 --> 00:44:33.500
<v Speaker 5>they don't live forever anyway,</v>

1770
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:37.740
<v Speaker 5>and the way they die in the wild by getting torn apart by wolves or coyotes or</v>

1771
00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:41.700
<v Speaker 5>mountain lions is way worse than a bullet or an arrow.</v>

1772
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:42.421
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1773
00:44:42.421 --> 00:44:43.170
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1774
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:46.740
<v Speaker 5>the life of an elk is a quick life if you're like,</v>

1775
00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:48.690
<v Speaker 5>not that one,</v>

1776
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:52.980
<v Speaker 5>but the one that one's probably only like maybe five years old,</v>

1777
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:54.300
<v Speaker 5>but the one outside,</v>

1778
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.370
<v Speaker 5>the big one over by the mats,</v>

1779
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.140
<v Speaker 5>that one's about nine years old.</v>

1780
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.310
<v Speaker 5>That's about as old as you gut.</v>

1781
00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:02.820
<v Speaker 5>If you find like a 10 11 year old elk,</v>

1782
00:45:02.821 --> 00:45:03.780
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit,</v>

1783
00:45:03.781 --> 00:45:07.320
<v Speaker 5>that guy's live forever and their teeth are all worn down and I didn't know.</v>

1784
00:45:07.321 --> 00:45:07.801
<v Speaker 5>I didn't know that.</v>

1785
00:45:07.801 --> 00:45:08.490
<v Speaker 5>I had no idea.</v>

1786
00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:08.911
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1787
00:45:08.911 --> 00:45:10.170
<v Speaker 5>they don't live very long.</v>

1788
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.500
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1789
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.180
<v Speaker 5>it's a hustle and they're,</v>

1790
00:45:12.181 --> 00:45:15.870
<v Speaker 5>they're out there just fighting for their life and trying to get by.</v>

1791
00:45:15.871 --> 00:45:17.580
<v Speaker 5>Most of the time they're just grazing,</v>

1792
00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:20.580
<v Speaker 5>but they'll look up and they'll see a wolf or something and it's like,</v>

1793
00:45:20.581 --> 00:45:21.151
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

1794
00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:21.661
<v Speaker 5>it's on,</v>

1795
00:45:21.661 --> 00:45:22.290
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1796
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:26.040
<v Speaker 5>I have some friends that live in Idaho and you know w I know who has a</v>

1797
00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:31.041
<v Speaker 5>considerable both population and they went on this scouting trip and when they</v>

1798
00:45:31.651 --> 00:45:33.780
<v Speaker 5>were up in the hills they kept finding,</v>

1799
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:39.080
<v Speaker 5>they found four dead really large bull elk that were torn apart by wolves.</v>

1800
00:45:40.870 --> 00:45:43.410
<v Speaker 5>And over the course of like a 10 mile hike,</v>

1801
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.950
<v Speaker 5>they found four of them laying there dead torn apart by wolves.</v>

1802
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:47.641
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>

1803
00:45:47.641 --> 00:45:48.900
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

1804
00:45:48.901 --> 00:45:50.190
<v Speaker 5>Like this is crazy.</v>

1805
00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:52.170
<v Speaker 5>So the wolves will eat part of it,</v>

1806
00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:54.300
<v Speaker 5>leave it there and it's cold as shit where they are.</v>

1807
00:45:54.301 --> 00:45:55.860
<v Speaker 5>They don't have to worry about the meat going bad.</v>

1808
00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.970
<v Speaker 5>So they'll kill it,</v>

1809
00:45:56.971 --> 00:45:57.781
<v Speaker 5>tear it apart,</v>

1810
00:45:57.781 --> 00:45:59.540
<v Speaker 5>and then they'll find another one and they'll,</v>

1811
00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:01.770
<v Speaker 5>their instinct is to go after the next one.</v>

1812
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.190
<v Speaker 5>They don't,</v>

1813
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:05.190
<v Speaker 5>they don't like just kill one and say we've got enough food,</v>

1814
00:46:05.191 --> 00:46:06.930
<v Speaker 5>we'll eat this until we were full.</v>

1815
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:07.831
<v Speaker 5>And then when we get hungry,</v>

1816
00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:08.600
<v Speaker 5>go hunt another one.</v>

1817
00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:09.030
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1818
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.863
<v Speaker 5>there's hunters.</v>

1819
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:11.570
<v Speaker 5>They do what's called the,</v>

1820
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:13.040
<v Speaker 5>what do they call it?</v>

1821
00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.780
<v Speaker 5>It's not like they don't call it sport hunting.</v>

1822
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:20.070
<v Speaker 5>There's a word for it when they kill like they was in Wyoming.</v>

1823
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:23.340
<v Speaker 5>What was that one crazy story in Wyoming,</v>

1824
00:46:23.341 --> 00:46:26.100
<v Speaker 5>they killed 19 elk and didn't even eat them.</v>

1825
00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:27.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1826
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.380
<v Speaker 5>They don't read for fun.</v>

1827
00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:28.681
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1828
00:46:28.681 --> 00:46:29.730
<v Speaker 5>they don't do it for fun.</v>

1829
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:31.140
<v Speaker 5>They can't help themselves.</v>

1830
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.730
<v Speaker 5>It's like surplus,</v>

1831
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.670
<v Speaker 5>surplus killing.</v>

1832
00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:34.560
<v Speaker 5>They just,</v>

1833
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:35.940
<v Speaker 5>they know they can get away with it,</v>

1834
00:46:35.941 --> 00:46:37.830
<v Speaker 5>so they just do it and then they'll,</v>

1835
00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.210
<v Speaker 5>they'll cash them.</v>

1836
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:39.660
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1837
00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:40.380
<v Speaker 5>Look at this.</v>

1838
00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.570
<v Speaker 5>19 out they,</v>

1839
00:46:41.571 --> 00:46:42.000
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

1840
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.070
<v Speaker 5>they recovered all of them and stacked them.</v>

1841
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.630
<v Speaker 5>They're not little either,</v>

1842
00:46:45.631 --> 00:46:46.464
<v Speaker 5>bro.</v>

1843
00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:49.800
<v Speaker 5>These are the ones they brought down from Canada to the wolves.</v>

1844
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:52.920
<v Speaker 5>They brought them down to the 90s to repopulate Yellowstone because we had</v>

1845
00:46:52.921 --> 00:46:55.950
<v Speaker 5>eradicated wolves from most of the western states.</v>

1846
00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:59.040
<v Speaker 5>Do you see that animal they just found in Montana and they don't even know what</v>

1847
00:46:59.041 --> 00:46:59.520
<v Speaker 5>it is?</v>

1848
00:46:59.520 --> 00:46:59.701
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1849
00:46:59.701 --> 00:47:00.720
<v Speaker 5>it's a wolf hybrid.</v>

1850
00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:02.420
<v Speaker 5>I saw a wolf vibrated with what?</v>

1851
00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.273
<v Speaker 5>The dog?</v>

1852
00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:03.841
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1853
00:47:03.841 --> 00:47:05.940
<v Speaker 5>Wolf probably fucked a German shepherd or something.</v>

1854
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.073
<v Speaker 5>They do.</v>

1855
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:08.310
<v Speaker 5>Most of the time they kill them.</v>

1856
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:09.631
<v Speaker 5>They'll kill dogs.</v>

1857
00:47:09.631 --> 00:47:12.360
<v Speaker 5>They eat dogs constantly that he funded that one.</v>

1858
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:12.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1859
00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:17.070
<v Speaker 5>He's probably hungry or probably horny rather not hungry and just said,</v>

1860
00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.210
<v Speaker 5>fuck off.</v>

1861
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.230
<v Speaker 5>Fuck this dog.</v>

1862
00:47:19.231 --> 00:47:20.640
<v Speaker 5>And see what happens.</v>

1863
00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:21.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1864
00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:22.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

00:47:22.711 --> 00:47:24.450
<v Speaker 5>Fuck him or fucked her rather.</v>

1867
00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:26.090
<v Speaker 5>It could've been that seriously.</v>

1868
00:47:26.091 --> 00:47:26.790
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1869
00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:27.720
<v Speaker 5>But you saw it.</v>

1870
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:28.021
<v Speaker 5>Did she?</v>

1871
00:47:28.021 --> 00:47:28.980
<v Speaker 5>That pictures of that thing.</v>

1872
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 5>To me it looks like</v>

1873
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:31.210
<v Speaker 4>a wolf dog hybrid.</v>

1874
00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:32.200
<v Speaker 4>Like maybe if somebody had,</v>

1875
00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:36.640
<v Speaker 4>what does that does this crazy Russian dog that looks like a werewolf.</v>

1876
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:41.890
<v Speaker 4>It's this weird Russian dog that's like fucking crazy hair all over the place.</v>

1877
00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.260
<v Speaker 4>And if a wolf fuck one of those,</v>

1878
00:47:44.261 --> 00:47:45.610
<v Speaker 4>it would probably look like this thing.</v>

1879
00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:47.413
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1880
00:47:47.730 --> 00:47:48.640
<v Speaker 4>Did you find that thing?</v>

1881
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:49.670
<v Speaker 4>What does it look like?</v>

1882
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:52.840
<v Speaker 4>They're good pictures of it so that picture sucks.</v>

1883
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:54.250
<v Speaker 4>That's just the back of it.</v>

1884
00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.410
<v Speaker 4>And this is another picture of it.</v>

1885
00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:56.290
<v Speaker 4>It's head</v>

1886
00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:01.750
<v Speaker 4>wolf dog shooting in Montana draws international intention.</v>

1887
00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:03.130
<v Speaker 4>Is it t?</v>

1888
00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:05.770
<v Speaker 4>To me it just looks like a dog fucked a wolf.</v>

1889
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.030
<v Speaker 4>It's just a big ass.</v>

1890
00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:07.960
<v Speaker 4>Hold the dog.</v>

1891
00:48:07.961 --> 00:48:08.640
<v Speaker 4>Fuck her though.</v>

1892
00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:09.700
<v Speaker 4>That is a big fucker.</v>

1893
00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:10.843
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

1894
00:48:10.930 --> 00:48:13.510
<v Speaker 4>it's a big animal that looks like 150 pound dog.</v>

1895
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:14.390
<v Speaker 4>Jeez.</v>

1896
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:15.660
<v Speaker 4>It'd be a little pickup too.</v>

1897
00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:17.370
<v Speaker 4>It could be like at Tacoma,</v>

1898
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:18.993
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1899
00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:21.010
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to tell and let's crazy.</v>

1900
00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:22.181
<v Speaker 4>They look,</v>

1901
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:23.014
<v Speaker 4>they're beautiful man.</v>

1902
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad they're out there.</v>

1903
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:25.181
<v Speaker 4>They're fascinating,</v>

1904
00:48:25.181 --> 00:48:26.830
<v Speaker 4>but they're rough on wildlife,</v>

1905
00:48:26.831 --> 00:48:27.270
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>

1906
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:28.103
<v Speaker 4>that's their life.</v>

1907
00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:32.360
<v Speaker 4>Their life is out there killing and the elks life is out there surviving.</v>

1908
00:48:32.361 --> 00:48:36.760
<v Speaker 4>And the way I feel about hunting is you just dip your legs and your body into</v>

1909
00:48:36.761 --> 00:48:39.640
<v Speaker 4>that world with discipline and with,</v>

1910
00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:39.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1911
00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1912
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:41.530
<v Speaker 4>an understanding of what you're doing.</v>

1913
00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:43.540
<v Speaker 4>And if you get lucky and you get an opportunity,</v>

1914
00:48:43.541 --> 00:48:45.250
<v Speaker 4>you kill one of those animals and bring it out.</v>

1915
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:46.151
<v Speaker 4>And they'd like,</v>

1916
00:48:46.151 --> 00:48:46.481
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

1917
00:48:46.481 --> 00:48:47.770
<v Speaker 4>that is the cleanest,</v>

1918
00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:49.240
<v Speaker 4>best way to eat meat.</v>

1919
00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1920
00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:55.080
<v Speaker 4>I just feel like there's no better way in terms of like a Karma in terms of your</v>

1921
00:48:55.391 --> 00:48:56.710
<v Speaker 4>interaction with nature,</v>

1922
00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:59.620
<v Speaker 4>the understanding connection that you have to your food.</v>

1923
00:48:59.621 --> 00:49:00.190
<v Speaker 4>There's just so,</v>

1924
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:01.510
<v Speaker 4>and then health wise,</v>

1925
00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.430
<v Speaker 4>there's no Monsanto,</v>

1926
00:49:03.431 --> 00:49:04.540
<v Speaker 4>GMO,</v>

1927
00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:06.040
<v Speaker 4>no spraying.</v>

1928
00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:06.671
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're,</v>

1929
00:49:06.671 --> 00:49:11.671
<v Speaker 4>you're eating a pure animal issue on Sunday.</v>

1930
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:12.821
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1931
00:49:12.821 --> 00:49:13.930
<v Speaker 4>Montana is the place,</v>

1932
00:49:13.931 --> 00:49:14.500
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1933
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.180
<v Speaker 4>Go back home means shit.</v>

1934
00:49:16.181 --> 00:49:20.650
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the Montana is some of the best elk hunting in the entire country.</v>

1935
00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.450
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather just eat my dad and brothers.</v>

1936
00:49:22.451 --> 00:49:23.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm more of a gathering.</v>

1937
00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.500
<v Speaker 4>That's good too,</v>

1938
00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:25.333
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1939
00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:26.951
<v Speaker 4>Hey man,</v>

1940
00:49:26.951 --> 00:49:27.461
<v Speaker 4>nothing wrong.</v>

1941
00:49:27.461 --> 00:49:28.870
<v Speaker 4>We've gathered a farming man.</v>

1942
00:49:28.871 --> 00:49:30.490
<v Speaker 4>Grow your own fucking vegetables.</v>

1943
00:49:30.491 --> 00:49:31.900
<v Speaker 4>You know that's the wrong cap.</v>

1944
00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:32.651
<v Speaker 4>That's the plan.</v>

1945
00:49:32.651 --> 00:49:35.320
<v Speaker 4>Eventually we're going to make a compound and have our own animals.</v>

1946
00:49:35.321 --> 00:49:35.471
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1947
00:49:35.471 --> 00:49:36.660
<v Speaker 4>I'll give you guys some meat.</v>

1948
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:38.980
<v Speaker 4>I got a whole couple of freezers back there.</v>

1949
00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.380
<v Speaker 4>That would be so when you guys go back,</v>

1950
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:42.760
<v Speaker 4>we're going to drive back then after.</v>

1951
00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:43.810
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

1952
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:44.131
<v Speaker 4>Oh Hook.</v>

1953
00:49:44.131 --> 00:49:44.560
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

1954
00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:44.950
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

1955
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:45.761
<v Speaker 4>By the time you get home,</v>

1956
00:49:45.761 --> 00:49:46.594
<v Speaker 4>you'll have,</v>

1957
00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:47.740
<v Speaker 4>you won't even be frozen,</v>

1958
00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.090
<v Speaker 4>but it won't even be thought out yet.</v>

1959
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:52.210
<v Speaker 4>How old were you when you took your first rip of weed?</v>

1960
00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:52.541
<v Speaker 4>Weed?</v>

1961
00:49:52.541 --> 00:49:53.140
<v Speaker 4>I was third.</v>

1962
00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:54.040
<v Speaker 4>Well not really.</v>

1963
00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:55.750
<v Speaker 4>So I'd smoked when I was younger,</v>

1964
00:49:56.380 --> 00:50:00.040
<v Speaker 4>but it was only like occasionally at like a party and always felt like a loser</v>

1965
00:50:00.041 --> 00:50:00.874
<v Speaker 4>for doing it.</v>

1966
00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:01.180
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1967
00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:02.730
<v Speaker 4>like everybody else would be getting high and,</v>

1968
00:50:02.731 --> 00:50:03.940
<v Speaker 4>but who toilet and,</v>

1969
00:50:03.941 --> 00:50:06.160
<v Speaker 4>but I was probably already drunk anyway,</v>

1970
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1971
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:08.650
<v Speaker 4>like when I was 14 or 15 or something like that.</v>

1972
00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:13.090
<v Speaker 4>So maybe I smoked weed a handful of times,</v>

1973
00:50:13.091 --> 00:50:15.880
<v Speaker 4>less than a dozen times until I was 30.</v>

1974
00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:18.970
<v Speaker 4>And then Eddie Bravo got me into it when I was 30 years old.</v>

1975
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:21.090
<v Speaker 4>We were doing Jujitsu together and uh,</v>

1976
00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:26.100
<v Speaker 4>he was telling me how marijuana is helping his Jujitsu and helping his music and</v>

1977
00:50:26.171 --> 00:50:26.861
<v Speaker 4>his creativity.</v>

1978
00:50:26.861 --> 00:50:27.140
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

1979
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is this</v>

1980
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.963
<v Speaker 5>guy talking about,</v>

1981
00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:29.410
<v Speaker 5>Mike?</v>

1982
00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:29.631
<v Speaker 5>Dude,</v>

1983
00:50:29.631 --> 00:50:31.010
<v Speaker 5>marijuana just makes it stupid.</v>

1984
00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:31.551
<v Speaker 5>Like don't,</v>

1985
00:50:31.551 --> 00:50:32.360
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1986
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:32.751
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1987
00:50:32.751 --> 00:50:33.111
<v Speaker 5>and he's like,</v>

1988
00:50:33.111 --> 00:50:33.944
<v Speaker 5>just try it.</v>

1989
00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.150
<v Speaker 5>And he,</v>

1990
00:50:35.151 --> 00:50:37.080
<v Speaker 5>we got high and uh,</v>

1991
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:38.750
<v Speaker 5>I remember thinking like,</v>

1992
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:39.643
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1993
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:40.940

00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:41.721
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1995
00:50:41.721 --> 00:50:42.860

1998
00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:50.630
<v Speaker 5>why it's this?</v>

1999
00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:50.811
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2000
00:50:50.811 --> 00:50:51.644
<v Speaker 5>it's just me and Eddie.</v>

2001
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:51.921
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2006
00:50:53.931 --> 00:50:55.280
<v Speaker 5>We went and got something to eat.</v>

2007
00:50:55.281 --> 00:50:56.210
<v Speaker 5>We're talking.</v>

2008
00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:56.541
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>

2009
00:50:56.541 --> 00:50:57.530
<v Speaker 5>we giggled like crazy.</v>

2010
00:50:58.010 --> 00:50:59.780
<v Speaker 5>Talked about all kinds of crazy shit.</v>

2011
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:04.610
<v Speaker 5>And then I remember I started smoking pot and getting on stage and got real.</v>

2027
00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:34.400
<v Speaker 5>and it's almost like the paranoia and the weirdness of it all.</v>

2028
00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:36.890
<v Speaker 5>You just fight it off by hitting that bag.</v>

2033
00:51:42.981 --> 00:51:47.981
<v Speaker 5>that one minute off to think about life and the future and the fucking universe</v>

2034
00:51:48.531 --> 00:51:51.750
<v Speaker 5>and volcanoes and Guatemala and Hawaii and Oh God,</v>

<v Speaker 5>it's a psychedelic experience.</v>

2042
00:51:59.601 --> 00:52:02.900
<v Speaker 5>It's like a cleansing experience hitting the bag when you're high.</v>

2043
00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:04.580
<v Speaker 5>I like sh I love shadowboxing.</v>

2044
00:52:04.581 --> 00:52:06.810
<v Speaker 5>When I'm high I'll take a rebel at home and just sit there,</v>

2045
00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:09.140
<v Speaker 5>have a little mirror and I'll just shadowbox don't even know how long.</v>

2046
00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.340
<v Speaker 5>I just can just shout a box for it.</v>

2047
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.140
<v Speaker 5>Go.</v>

2048
00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:12.921
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what's weird?</v>

2049
00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:15.800
<v Speaker 5>Like you feel balanced when you're high.</v>

2050
00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:16.880
<v Speaker 5>You feel like,</v>

2051
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:19.190
<v Speaker 5>like maybe like if you got an injury,</v>

2052
00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:20.540
<v Speaker 5>you feel it more,</v>

2053
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.700
<v Speaker 5>you feel like we're laser off.</v>

2054
00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:23.661
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

2055
00:52:23.661 --> 00:52:24.920
<v Speaker 5>And like for me,</v>

2056
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:26.020
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

2057
00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:29.690
<v Speaker 5>I feel my transfer a power better when I'm high.</v>

2058
00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:30.620
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2059
00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:32.210
<v Speaker 5>like certain techniques I,</v>

2060
00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:36.170
<v Speaker 5>I really get the timing of like when to turn the hip over.</v>

2061
00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:38.270
<v Speaker 5>I feel it more when I'm high.</v>

2062
00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:38.680
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>

2063
00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.750
<v Speaker 5>I feel the connection with all that tissue,</v>

2064
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:43.370
<v Speaker 5>all of it working together.</v>

2065
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:46.220
<v Speaker 5>I swear it helps you just stay in the moment a little bit more.</v>

2066
00:52:46.221 --> 00:52:49.160
<v Speaker 5>Especially at night after you train real hard and you're thinking about your</v>

2067
00:52:49.161 --> 00:52:50.170
<v Speaker 5>mind's going a hundred miles per hour.</v>

2075
00:53:00.351 --> 00:53:00.951

2131
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:15.990
<v Speaker 2>they just let it kind of heal and live with it.</v>

2155
00:54:48.450 --> 00:54:50.340
<v Speaker 3>cause I personally don't like smoking all day.</v>

2156
00:54:50.430 --> 00:54:52.560
<v Speaker 3>I feel like it makes me unload and not,</v>

2157
00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:53.161
<v Speaker 3>it's not the weed,</v>

2158
00:54:53.161 --> 00:54:53.491
<v Speaker 3>it's me.</v>

2159
00:54:53.491 --> 00:54:54.480
<v Speaker 3>I feel I'm motivated,</v>

2160
00:54:54.481 --> 00:54:55.160
<v Speaker 3>I just don't really like it.</v>

2161
00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:55.711
<v Speaker 3>But when I was playing,</v>

2162
00:54:55.711 --> 00:54:56.400
<v Speaker 3>when I was gaming,</v>

2163
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.031
<v Speaker 3>it was the best.</v>

2164
00:54:57.031 --> 00:54:58.500
<v Speaker 3>I just game and smoking all day.</v>

2165
00:54:58.830 --> 00:54:59.663
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

2171
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:06.300
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2172
00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:07.290
<v Speaker 3>let's talk about smoking weed.</v>

2173
00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:07.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2174

2175
00:55:12.331 --> 00:55:14.310
<v Speaker 3>almost like I want to get shit done during the day.</v>

2176
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.151

00:55:21.211 --> 00:55:21.630
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2186
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:24.240

2187
00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.031
<v Speaker 3>And I go there.</v>

2188
00:55:25.031 --> 00:55:25.381
<v Speaker 3>I know there's like,</v>

2189
00:55:25.381 --> 00:55:27.210
<v Speaker 3>you have a huge following of,</v>

2190

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2192
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.600
<v Speaker 3>the people who smoke weed and it's so easy to,</v>

2193
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:32.490
<v Speaker 3>for marijuana to take over your life and,</v>

2194

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.660
<v Speaker 3>and I felt that when I was gaming and smoking,</v>

2197
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:38.191
<v Speaker 3>I just want,</v>

2198

2200
00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:39.430
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2201
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2202
00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:40.710
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

2203
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Take a rip,</v>

2204
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.821
<v Speaker 3>take her up,</v>

2205
00:55:41.821 --> 00:55:42.390
<v Speaker 3>take her up.</v>

00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2207
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:44.550
<v Speaker 3>and it takes over your life.</v>

2208
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.980
<v Speaker 3>And I feel like it's,</v>

2209
00:55:46.981 --> 00:55:47.814
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2210
00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.220
<v Speaker 3>it's such a powerful drug.</v>

2211
00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:49.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2212
00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:50.581
<v Speaker 3>and I don't like the word drug.</v>

2213
00:55:50.581 --> 00:55:51.414
<v Speaker 3>It's such a powerful,</v>

2214
00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:52.470
<v Speaker 3>it is a drug though.</v>

2215
00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:53.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2216
00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:53.770
<v Speaker 3>mass,</v>

2217
00:55:53.770 --> 00:55:56.600
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people probably masks a lot of people's feelings.</v>

2218
00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:57.750
<v Speaker 3>How they truly feel.</v>

2219
00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:00.180
<v Speaker 3>It's so easy to get high all day instead of deal with them.</v>

2220
00:56:00.181 --> 00:56:00.961
<v Speaker 3>Certain emotion.</v>

2221
00:56:00.961 --> 00:56:01.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2222
00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2223
00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:02.450
<v Speaker 2>so I just feel like,</v>

2224
00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.880
<v Speaker 2>I feel like people are abusing it way too much now.</v>

2225
00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Some people certainly are.</v>

2226
00:56:06.911 --> 00:56:07.551
<v Speaker 2>Some people are,</v>

2227
00:56:07.551 --> 00:56:09.230
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's the case with everything though,</v>

2228
00:56:09.231 --> 00:56:09.381
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2229
00:56:09.381 --> 00:56:10.430
<v Speaker 2>Is it is.</v>

2230
00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2231
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:12.680

2233
00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:13.820
<v Speaker 2>how did they fix it?</v>

2234
00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:14.150
<v Speaker 2>What did it,</v>

2235
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.983

2238

<v Speaker 2>A lot of,</v>

2251
00:56:35.861 --> 00:56:36.301
<v Speaker 2>with my foot.</v>

2252
00:56:36.301 --> 00:56:37.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like a slap.</v>

2253
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.960
<v Speaker 2>She'll look at Thompson.</v>

2254
00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he throws a lot of instep kicks.</v>

2256
00:56:39.761 --> 00:56:39.941
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2257
00:56:39.941 --> 00:56:42.460
<v Speaker 2>that was the karate way for the longest time.</v>

2258
00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:46.870
<v Speaker 2>I literally remember I knock someone out in Seattle with my foot and the dude</v>

2259
00:56:46.871 --> 00:56:48.580
<v Speaker 2>was out for like 10 minutes.</v>

2260
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:49.121
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

2261
00:56:49.121 --> 00:56:49.720
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>

2262
00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:50.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2263
00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:51.071
<v Speaker 2>that was gnarly.</v>

2264
00:56:51.071 --> 00:56:53.890
<v Speaker 2>It was literally my foot slapping his jaw and I was like,</v>

2265
00:56:53.891 --> 00:56:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

2266
00:56:54.941 --> 00:56:57.910
<v Speaker 2>That's most certainly can knock people out with your foot.</v>

2267
00:56:57.940 --> 00:56:58.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2268
00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:00.490
<v Speaker 2>that's Phil Davis and Belterra just knock that guy out.</v>

2269
00:57:00.491 --> 00:57:01.390
<v Speaker 2>That was his foot,</v>

2270
00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:02.320
<v Speaker 2>wasn't it?</v>

2271
00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Didn't this wetland cats weird.</v>

2272
00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:04.750
<v Speaker 2>You don't see it coming.</v>

2273
00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:05.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2274
00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:06.910
<v Speaker 2>So the shots you don't see coming.</v>

2275
00:57:06.911 --> 00:57:07.091
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2276
00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:07.660
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

2277
00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Especially when they come over the shoulder,</v>

2278
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.961
<v Speaker 2>you know those,</v>

2279
00:57:10.961 --> 00:57:13.510
<v Speaker 2>those round kicks or come over the shoulder from the outside.</v>

2280
00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:15.450
<v Speaker 2>Even Thomson [inaudible] through that.</v>

2281
00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:16.130
<v Speaker 2>That was the last prayer,</v>

2282
00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:18.730
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite knockouts and he came over like I literally looked at,</v>

2283
00:57:18.731 --> 00:57:21.220
<v Speaker 2>came over question why I was so sweet.</v>

2284
00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:22.480
<v Speaker 2>It's almost a question mark.</v>

2285
00:57:22.481 --> 00:57:22.691
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2286
00:57:22.691 --> 00:57:23.710
<v Speaker 2>Almost like that one.</v>

2287
00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:26.400
<v Speaker 2>But you know the question mark one comes straight up the middle ground.</v>

2288
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:30.010
<v Speaker 2>I threw the question mark kick landed and then that's when I did it.</v>

2289
00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:30.700
<v Speaker 2>That's what I remember.</v>

2290
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:30.971
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2291
00:57:30.971 --> 00:57:32.110
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to bring this up too.</v>

2292
00:57:32.290 --> 00:57:33.123
<v Speaker 2>I remember,</v>

2293
00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:33.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2294
00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:34.170
<v Speaker 2>you had,</v>

2295
00:57:34.170 --> 00:57:34.520
<v Speaker 2>you were,</v>

2296
00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what podcasts with,</v>

2297
00:57:35.591 --> 00:57:36.424
<v Speaker 2>but you're talking about,</v>

2298
00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:38.290
<v Speaker 2>you were looking at my Instagram and you saw the,</v>

2299
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.180
<v Speaker 2>I did a kick to a guard pass.</v>

2300
00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:40.811
<v Speaker 2>I was in front of him,</v>

2301
00:57:40.811 --> 00:57:44.410
<v Speaker 2>did a three 60 yard pass and I remember you saying he could do that in a fight</v>

2302
00:57:44.411 --> 00:57:45.610
<v Speaker 2>if he practiced it a lot.</v>

2303
00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:47.290
<v Speaker 2>And I've been practicing that,</v>

2304
00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:51.550
<v Speaker 2>so I've been doing that for a couple of years now and I did it in that Andre</v>

2305
00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:52.150
<v Speaker 2>fight I was,</v>

2306
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:55.870
<v Speaker 2>he was up against the cage and I three 60 past into side control and I wanted to</v>

2307
00:57:55.871 --> 00:57:56.980
<v Speaker 2>bring that up and tell you that.</v>

2308
00:57:56.981 --> 00:57:57.814
<v Speaker 2>But it was,</v>

2309
00:57:58.420 --> 00:57:59.920
<v Speaker 2>it works spinning.</v>

2310
00:57:59.921 --> 00:58:02.650
<v Speaker 2>The people don't know what to do when you spin.</v>

2311
00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:03.921
<v Speaker 2>I spun it,</v>

2312
00:58:03.921 --> 00:58:04.331
<v Speaker 2>he covered,</v>

2313
00:58:04.331 --> 00:58:05.080
<v Speaker 2>you'd cover it up.</v>

2314
00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:05.621
<v Speaker 2>I'm past,</v>

2315
00:58:05.621 --> 00:58:06.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm already inside control now.</v>

2316
00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:11.380
<v Speaker 2>This is a moment they have to think and when I'm a striking as well,</v>

2317
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:15.460
<v Speaker 2>usually when I spend a backup and cover up like I'm going to go to your body</v>

2318
00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:16.990
<v Speaker 2>when your body and I'm gonna go to your head,</v>

2319
00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:18.790
<v Speaker 2>you can get away with a lot of stuff.</v>

2320
00:58:18.790 --> 00:58:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Other people can't you so fucking athletic.</v>

2321
00:58:20.921 --> 00:58:23.290
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you could be a pro and a bunch of different sports,</v>

2322
00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.030
<v Speaker 2>like his timing and his eyes.</v>

2323
00:58:25.031 --> 00:58:25.960
<v Speaker 2>Like what did the doctor say?</v>

2324
00:58:25.961 --> 00:58:27.100
<v Speaker 2>You have some of the best eyes.</v>

2325
00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:27.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2326
00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.800
<v Speaker 2>I remember going to the eye doctor a few different ones and they're like,</v>

2327
00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:30.311
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

2328
00:58:30.311 --> 00:58:31.144
<v Speaker 2>your eyes are,</v>

2329
00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:33.610
<v Speaker 2>there are some of the best I've ever seen in my life.</v>

2330
00:58:33.611 --> 00:58:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Like they were taken back.</v>

2331
00:58:34.481 --> 00:58:35.314
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

2332
00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:39.550
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno if that transfers over to fighting and my distance,</v>

2333
00:58:39.551 --> 00:58:43.540
<v Speaker 2>you know how I see things coming or you found your range such at a young age to</v>

2334
00:58:43.541 --> 00:58:45.580
<v Speaker 2>not like a wrestler likes concept penetration.</v>

2335
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:47.470
<v Speaker 2>Penetration penetrates to start as a striker.</v>

2336
00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:51.910
<v Speaker 2>So he's got his range down so good in his eyes and his timing and his reaction</v>

2337
00:58:51.911 --> 00:58:53.650
<v Speaker 2>time is so fucking fast.</v>

2338
00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:55.480
<v Speaker 2>So like everyone sees him and they're like,</v>

2339
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.900
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2340
00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:56.160
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2341
00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:56.980
<v Speaker 2>that's beatable.</v>

2342
00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:58.240
<v Speaker 2>But when with him in front of you,</v>

2343
00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:00.160
<v Speaker 2>it's way fucking picture length,</v>

2344
00:59:00.161 --> 00:59:01.690
<v Speaker 2>man for your weight class,</v>

2345
00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:03.880
<v Speaker 2>for band and what you're so fucking long.</v>

2346
00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:06.340
<v Speaker 2>And I told you when I saw you,</v>

2347
00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:11.140
<v Speaker 2>I thought for a second that you might've been the son of Michael O'malley.</v>

2348
00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:15.310
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy named Michael O'malley who was my original taekwondo instructor,</v>

2349
00:59:15.311 --> 00:59:17.830
<v Speaker 2>was a four time national champion.</v>

2350
00:59:17.831 --> 00:59:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Like literally one of the best taekwondo fighters in the world in his play is</v>

2351
00:59:21.861 --> 00:59:22.390
<v Speaker 2>tall.</v>

2352
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2353
00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:27.410
<v Speaker 4>he's very tall and he fought one 47 little skinny man.</v>

2354
00:59:27.411 --> 00:59:29.600
<v Speaker 4>It's like six three they cut weight and taekwondo.</v>

2355
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:30.370
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2356
00:59:30.370 --> 00:59:30.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2357
00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:31.940
<v Speaker 4>but terribly nobody,</v>

2358
00:59:31.941 --> 00:59:33.260
<v Speaker 4>nobody knows what they're doing.</v>

2359
00:59:33.850 --> 00:59:35.540
<v Speaker 4>They cut weight and fight the same day.</v>

2360
00:59:35.541 --> 00:59:36.890
<v Speaker 4>But he was a,</v>

2361
00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:37.731
<v Speaker 4>he was a beast.</v>

2362
00:59:37.731 --> 00:59:39.470
<v Speaker 4>He was my original taekwondo instructor.</v>

2363
00:59:39.471 --> 00:59:40.760
<v Speaker 4>He was Jay Hahn,</v>

2364
00:59:40.761 --> 00:59:42.410
<v Speaker 4>Kim's prize student.</v>

2365
00:59:42.411 --> 00:59:44.160
<v Speaker 4>He was his number one student town.</v>

2366
00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:45.380
<v Speaker 4>And when I started,</v>

2367
00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:47.420
<v Speaker 4>Michael had stopped fighting.</v>

2368
00:59:47.421 --> 00:59:50.810
<v Speaker 4>He was just teaching and now he runs a school in a Peabody.</v>

2369
00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:54.800
<v Speaker 4>But he basically taught me almost everything that I know.</v>

2370
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:56.030
<v Speaker 4>And Mr. Kim,</v>

2371
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:59.630
<v Speaker 4>Mr. Kim took over as well when he came back.</v>

2372
00:59:59.631 --> 01:00:02.240
<v Speaker 4>But when I first started training there for the first year or so,</v>

2373
01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:06.050
<v Speaker 4>Mr. Kim was in Korea and I learned everything from Mr O'malley.</v>

2374
01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.160
<v Speaker 4>Fucking long limbs.</v>

2375
01:00:07.161 --> 01:00:07.994
<v Speaker 4>Just that he was younger too,</v>

2376
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:09.030
<v Speaker 4>so fast,</v>

2377
01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.580
<v Speaker 4>so fast.</v>

2378
01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:11.720
<v Speaker 4>He was so fast.</v>

2379
01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.790
<v Speaker 4>He would do demonstrations on people,</v>

2380
01:00:13.791 --> 01:00:14.120
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2381
01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.510
<v Speaker 4>like demonstrations of the house,</v>

2382
01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:18.380
<v Speaker 4>set things up and you would see him do things and it was just,</v>

2383
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:19.760
<v Speaker 4>it was confusing.</v>

2384
01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.200
<v Speaker 4>You'd be like fuck.</v>

2385
01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:24.560
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if that guy was trying to kick me like yeah cause you'd be fucked</v>

2386
01:00:24.590 --> 01:00:28.370
<v Speaker 4>because he was so good at setting things up and footwork and movement.</v>

2387
01:00:28.371 --> 01:00:30.020
<v Speaker 4>And so when I saw you I was like,</v>

2388
01:00:30.021 --> 01:00:30.741
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

2389
01:00:30.741 --> 01:00:33.130
<v Speaker 4>this kid looks like Michael O'malley.</v>

2390
01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.740
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2391
01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.070
<v Speaker 4>I thought you were his son.</v>

2392
01:00:35.071 --> 01:00:35.690
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>

2393
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:36.560
<v Speaker 4>Like I really did.</v>

2394
01:00:36.561 --> 01:00:37.970
<v Speaker 4>I was like Holy Shit,</v>

2395
01:00:37.971 --> 01:00:42.710
<v Speaker 4>his son is fine cause I haven't talked to Michael in a long time.</v>

2396
01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:45.320
<v Speaker 4>I really did think that you were a son.</v>

2397
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:46.250
<v Speaker 4>That would have been nuts.</v>

2398
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:47.143
<v Speaker 4>That would have been,</v>

2399
01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:47.541
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2400
01:00:47.541 --> 01:00:48.141
<v Speaker 4>I was like wow,</v>

2401
01:00:48.141 --> 01:00:49.460
<v Speaker 4>when I see this kid I've got to ask him.</v>

2402
01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.060
<v Speaker 4>Nope,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he teaches at a Jen soul fighters and I go there and drill Monday,</v>

2453
01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:03.340

2457
01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.110
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>

2458
01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.700

2459
01:02:09.701 --> 01:02:10.151

2460
01:02:10.151 --> 01:02:10.571
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>

2461
01:02:10.571 --> 01:02:11.710
<v Speaker 3>any knowledge he's sending me.</v>

2462
01:02:11.711 --> 01:02:12.190
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

2463
01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:13.720
<v Speaker 3>he's such a huge benefit,</v>

2464
01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:17.600
<v Speaker 3>like a huge benefit to me to becoming what I want to be in.</v>

2465
01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:18.340
<v Speaker 3>It's so awesome.</v>

2466
01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:20.580
<v Speaker 3>Like we're doing this together so it's cool.</v>

2467
01:02:20.581 --> 01:02:22.260
<v Speaker 3>I remember being 19 and their apartment,</v>

2468
01:02:22.261 --> 01:02:24.000
<v Speaker 3>like this is what I wanted.</v>

2469
01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:28.080
<v Speaker 3>Everything like training and to have to have him here with me.</v>

2470
01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:29.011
<v Speaker 3>Even just being here,</v>

2471
01:02:29.011 --> 01:02:31.260
<v Speaker 3>it's just so awesome to travel everywhere.</v>

2472
01:02:31.261 --> 01:02:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere I go he's,</v>

2473
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:32.851
<v Speaker 3>we're going places,</v>

2474
01:02:32.851 --> 01:02:35.280
<v Speaker 3>we're traveling and we're training everywhere we go or train.</v>

2475
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:36.143
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>

2476
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:41.070
<v Speaker 4>So how satisfying is it for you to see him in a position like the Andre fight</v>

2477
01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:45.750
<v Speaker 4>where like I thought you made a big leap in between that fight and who is your</v>

2478
01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:46.740
<v Speaker 4>around around.</v>

2479
01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:47.400
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

2480
01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.630
<v Speaker 4>Which was a very good fight too,</v>

2481
01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:49.770
<v Speaker 4>but I was like,</v>

2482
01:02:49.771 --> 01:02:50.311
<v Speaker 4>damn,</v>

2483
01:02:50.311 --> 01:02:51.780
<v Speaker 4>this kid's getting better.</v>

2484
01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.520
<v Speaker 4>I'll be like,</v>

2485
01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.640
<v Speaker 4>you made a leap.</v>

2486
01:02:53.850 --> 01:02:55.380
<v Speaker 4>You are doing a lot of like weird,</v>

2487
01:02:55.381 --> 01:02:58.010
<v Speaker 4>unpredictable shit in the [inaudible] fight.</v>

2488
01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:00.000
<v Speaker 4>You were moving around a lot and I was like,</v>

2489
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:04.380
<v Speaker 4>you will have real confident and like you were just constantly moving forward.</v>

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:05.993
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

2492
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.440
<v Speaker 4>how much is it?</v>

2493
01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:10.980
<v Speaker 4>Like how good does it feel to watch someone improve?</v>

2494
01:03:10.981 --> 01:03:11.814
<v Speaker 4>Like that</v>

2495
01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.270
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2496
01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:15.850
<v Speaker 3>it feels just as good as as if it was me doing it sometimes more,</v>

2497
01:03:15.851 --> 01:03:16.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2498
01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:17.800
<v Speaker 3>Like sometimes like sometimes more.</v>

2499
01:03:17.801 --> 01:03:18.281
<v Speaker 3>That's how I'm like,</v>

2500
01:03:18.281 --> 01:03:19.114

2562
01:04:38.821 --> 01:04:39.160
<v Speaker 3>Accurate.</v>

2563
01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:39.640
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>

2564
01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:40.473
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2565
01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:41.643
<v Speaker 3>I've been learning,</v>

2566
01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:46.450
<v Speaker 3>I've been listening to a lot of podcasts about ego and Aubrey Marcus and with</v>

2567
01:04:46.451 --> 01:04:50.110
<v Speaker 3>Aubrey Marcus and just a bunch of different people and it's scary learning about</v>

2568
01:04:50.111 --> 01:04:52.750
<v Speaker 3>your ego and like who you really are and who you ego is.</v>

2569
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:57.760
<v Speaker 3>And we're understanding the two different people like fighting in this whole</v>

2570
01:04:57.761 --> 01:04:58.090
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

2571
01:04:58.090 --> 01:05:01.450
<v Speaker 3>this whole like any like Instagram's basically your ego.</v>

2572
01:05:01.451 --> 01:05:02.470
<v Speaker 3>That's who your ego is.</v>

2573
01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.670
<v Speaker 3>I feel like for me,</v>

2574
01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.073
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2575

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:06.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2577
01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:09.040
<v Speaker 3>I feel like social media for your character,</v>

2578
01:05:09.041 --> 01:05:12.550
<v Speaker 3>like you push out what you want people to think of you like that kind of thing.</v>

2579
01:05:12.610 --> 01:05:13.420
<v Speaker 3>Everyone does.</v>

2580
01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:16.090
<v Speaker 3>Like you post what you want people like that's what people are gonna think of</v>

2581
01:05:16.091 --> 01:05:17.170
<v Speaker 3>you as whatever you post.</v>

2582
01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:17.630
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2583
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2584
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:22.420
<v Speaker 3>and then like realizing because like I was broke last year,</v>

2585
01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:25.120
<v Speaker 3>this time I was probably broke and now I have a good amount of money and it's,</v>

2586
01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:27.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm realizing money doesn't make you happy.</v>

2587
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:29.500
<v Speaker 3>Materialistic things don't make you happy.</v>

2588
01:05:29.501 --> 01:05:30.850
<v Speaker 3>And I know everyone says that.</v>

2589
01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:31.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2590
01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:32.231
<v Speaker 3>who was it?</v>

2591
01:05:32.231 --> 01:05:33.490

2592
01:05:33.491 --> 01:05:34.960
<v Speaker 3>I wish everyone could be rich,</v>

2593
01:05:34.961 --> 01:05:38.260
<v Speaker 3>wants to realize that they don't want to rich and famous and famous to realize</v>

2594
01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.210
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make you happy because I have that a lot of people,</v>

2595
01:05:40.211 --> 01:05:41.044
<v Speaker 3>like my little brother,</v>

2596
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:42.850
<v Speaker 3>I was telling him trying to like get him,</v>

2597
01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.030
<v Speaker 3>I want to pay him to help run my youtube panel.</v>

2598
01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:45.251

2599
01:05:45.251 --> 01:05:46.450
<v Speaker 3>you can make $60,000 a year,</v>

2600
01:05:46.451 --> 01:05:46.571

01:05:46.721 --> 01:05:47.230
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

2603
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.500
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2604
01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:47.621
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

01:05:47.621 --> 01:05:49.000
<v Speaker 3>that's not a lot and that's not enough.</v>

2606
01:05:49.001 --> 01:05:49.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2607
01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:50.081
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

2608
01:05:50.081 --> 01:05:53.650
<v Speaker 3>you could literally not have to work and be like,</v>

2610
01:05:55.121 --> 01:05:57.040
<v Speaker 3>but I'm trying to get millionaires and it's just like,</v>

2611
01:05:57.041 --> 01:05:58.180
<v Speaker 3>that's not what makes you happy.</v>

2612
01:05:58.181 --> 01:05:58.541
<v Speaker 3>And I'm really,</v>

2613
01:05:58.541 --> 01:05:59.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm finding that out.</v>

2614
01:06:00.010 --> 01:06:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Like at a young Adam's like I understand like my ego is motivated by money.</v>

2615
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:09.370
<v Speaker 3>I love money and I love just this whole fight game is just all about just,</v>

2616
01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.300
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I'm learning so much.</v>

2617
01:06:13.301 --> 01:06:13.811
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to,</v>

2618
01:06:13.811 --> 01:06:17.230
<v Speaker 3>hard to explain my brain and I'm still trying to figure out all of this.</v>

2619
01:06:17.231 --> 01:06:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Everything I'm learning,</v>

2620
01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:20.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm listening to so many podcasts everyday,</v>

2621
01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.550
<v Speaker 3>reading so many books every day and I,</v>

2622
01:06:22.551 --> 01:06:26.470
<v Speaker 3>I can't really explain what my brain try try to explain what you were,</v>

2623
01:06:26.471 --> 01:06:27.400
<v Speaker 3>your original thoughts.</v>

2624
01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:32.020
<v Speaker 3>So like you feel like what you're putting out on social media is the ego and</v>

2625
01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:34.120
<v Speaker 3>what you really are like who you really are,</v>

2626
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:35.170
<v Speaker 3>is something different.</v>

2627
01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:35.501
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2628
01:06:35.501 --> 01:06:35.651
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2629
01:06:35.651 --> 01:06:37.210
<v Speaker 3>I think just humans in general,</v>

2630
01:06:37.211 --> 01:06:38.320
<v Speaker 3>we're all at the core.</v>

2631
01:06:38.321 --> 01:06:40.090
<v Speaker 3>We're all just want love and compassion.</v>

2632
01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:41.193
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2633
01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:44.740
<v Speaker 3>and so you want that from fighting fight.</v>

2634
01:06:44.741 --> 01:06:48.850
<v Speaker 3>Like what makes me truly happy is training digit to you're training in general,</v>

2635
01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:51.580
<v Speaker 3>eating healthy and being around people.</v>

2636
01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:52.930
<v Speaker 3>I love being around my dogs.</v>

2637
01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm watering my flowers.</v>

2638
01:06:54.791 --> 01:06:56.100
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what makes me happy.</v>

2639
01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:56.943
<v Speaker 3>That's what makes,</v>

2640
01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.053
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2641
01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:02.020
<v Speaker 3>what kind of satisfaction do you get from fighting to show?</v>

2642
01:07:02.021 --> 01:07:02.800
<v Speaker 3>I love work.</v>

2643
01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.090
<v Speaker 3>I love performing.</v>

2644
01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:05.290
<v Speaker 3>Ever since I was a little kid,</v>

2645
01:07:05.291 --> 01:07:07.960
<v Speaker 3>I've always tried to perform in front of whoever was around my,</v>

2646
01:07:07.961 --> 01:07:09.140
<v Speaker 3>if we had to get together a fan,</v>

2647
01:07:09.141 --> 01:07:09.331
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

2648
01:07:09.331 --> 01:07:10.300
<v Speaker 3>I would always be in a loud,</v>

2649
01:07:10.301 --> 01:07:12.040
<v Speaker 3>obnoxious trying to perform and do something.</v>

2650
01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.750
<v Speaker 3>I love performing like that.</v>

2651
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:16.720
<v Speaker 3>Performing in front of huge crowds.</v>

2652
01:07:16.721 --> 01:07:17.321
<v Speaker 3>Like he was saying,</v>

2653
01:07:17.321 --> 01:07:18.071
<v Speaker 3>the bigger the crowd,</v>

2654
01:07:18.071 --> 01:07:19.210
<v Speaker 3>the more people watching them,</v>

2655
01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:19.691
<v Speaker 3>the better.</v>

2656
01:07:19.691 --> 01:07:20.680
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I perform.</v>

2657
01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:22.003
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2658
01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:24.333
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2659
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:27.640
<v Speaker 3>When you start learning about that stuff and take mushrooms,</v>

2660
01:07:27.641 --> 01:07:28.700
<v Speaker 3>it really opens your brain.</v>

2661
01:07:29.070 --> 01:07:31.900
<v Speaker 3>Other different pathways and changes.</v>

2662
01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:32.810
<v Speaker 3>How you looking at this?</v>

2663
01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:37.840
<v Speaker 3>I think mushrooms are one of my favorite things I've ever done.</v>

2664
01:07:38.110 --> 01:07:39.880
<v Speaker 3>I've done mushrooms pray five times and it's,</v>

2665
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.811
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2666
01:07:40.811 --> 01:07:41.231
<v Speaker 3>we're right,</v>

2667
01:07:41.231 --> 01:07:41.831
<v Speaker 3>right after that,</v>

2668
01:07:41.831 --> 01:07:42.940
<v Speaker 3>right after a mushroom trip,</v>

2669
01:07:42.941 --> 01:07:44.110
<v Speaker 3>you feel you're so much more,</v>

2670
01:07:44.111 --> 01:07:45.880
<v Speaker 3>you realize everyone's going through shit.</v>

2671
01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:50.000
<v Speaker 3>Like everyone is going through some and make you want to be nicer to people and</v>

2672
01:07:50.010 --> 01:07:51.070
<v Speaker 3>they just want to be kinder.</v>

2673
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:55.150
<v Speaker 3>And then I get four or five months later you start getting a deer and wild ways</v>

2674
01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:55.481
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>

2675
01:07:55.481 --> 01:07:56.440
<v Speaker 3>oh I need to do mushrooms again.</v>

2676
01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:57.873
<v Speaker 3>Need a reset.</v>

2677
01:07:58.370 --> 01:07:59.320
<v Speaker 3>Have you done DMT?</v>

2678
01:07:59.710 --> 01:08:00.101
<v Speaker 3>I have not.</v>

2679
01:08:00.101 --> 01:08:03.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually kind of scared to do DMT cause I know like that,</v>

2680
01:08:03.101 --> 01:08:04.030
<v Speaker 3>that's what I talk about my ego.</v>

2681
01:08:04.031 --> 01:08:04.864
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2682
01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:06.370
<v Speaker 3>like even mushrooms,</v>

2683
01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:08.920
<v Speaker 3>they attack your ego almost Kinda,</v>

2684
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:09.783
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2685
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:11.223
<v Speaker 3>And we need that.</v>

2686
01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:12.790
<v Speaker 3>And I need that ego to keep,</v>

2687
01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:13.830
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

2688
01:08:13.830 --> 01:08:14.010
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2689
01:08:14.010 --> 01:08:14.710
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2690
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:15.830
<v Speaker 3>you need your ego right now.</v>

2691
01:08:15.831 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 3>So what</v>

2692
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:16.370
<v Speaker 4>you're saying,</v>

2693
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:16.720
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2694
01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:19.360
<v Speaker 3>we got a new Connor's ego is huge.</v>

2695
01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:20.530
<v Speaker 3>Con,</v>

2696
01:08:20.530 --> 01:08:21.820
<v Speaker 3>you need to have a big ego.</v>

2697
01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.680
<v Speaker 3>You need to have an ego just to do anything.</v>

2698
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:24.790
<v Speaker 3>We are.</v>

2699
01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:25.623
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2700
01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:31.580
<v Speaker 4>but is it the ego or do you need to have the desire to achieve excellence?</v>

2701
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:32.100
<v Speaker 4>It.</v>

2702
01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:33.780
<v Speaker 4>Is that always the ego?</v>

2703
01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:35.430
<v Speaker 4>Can you do that without the self?</v>

2704
01:08:35.670 --> 01:08:37.320
<v Speaker 4>Can you do that just as a task,</v>

2705
01:08:37.321 --> 01:08:41.850
<v Speaker 4>as a goal and be completely committed and single minded in your approach to try</v>

2706
01:08:41.851 --> 01:08:43.080
<v Speaker 4>to achieve excellence?</v>

2707
01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.910
<v Speaker 4>Can you do that without the ego?</v>

2708
01:08:44.911 --> 01:08:46.440
<v Speaker 4>Can you do it as a project?</v>

2709
01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:48.540
<v Speaker 4>Can you do it as a task?</v>

2710
01:08:48.690 --> 01:08:49.261
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>

2711

<v Speaker 4>I think you can too.</v>

2712
01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:53.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if you build this character that I want to build this person,</v>

2713
01:08:53.431 --> 01:08:54.264
<v Speaker 3>this persona,</v>

2714
01:08:54.450 --> 01:08:55.860
<v Speaker 3>but why do you want to build a persona?</v>

2715
01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:57.450
<v Speaker 3>Cause you see Conor do it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's just fun,</v>

2724
01:09:02.730 --> 01:09:03.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2725
01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:03.923
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't,</v>

2726
01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:05.341
<v Speaker 3>plus,</v>

2727
01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:05.551
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2728
01:09:05.551 --> 01:09:06.540
<v Speaker 3>if we build a persona,</v>

2729
01:09:06.541 --> 01:09:08.090
<v Speaker 3>the bigger checks are going to cough,</v>

2730
01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:09.090
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2731
01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:09.571
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2732
01:09:09.571 --> 01:09:11.190
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not trying to not be me.</v>

2733
01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:12.540
<v Speaker 3>Like everything I do is me.</v>

2734
01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:13.730
<v Speaker 3>Like I just,</v>

2735
01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:14.581
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2736
01:09:14.581 --> 01:09:18.000
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy trying to find a happy medium,</v>

2737
01:09:18.001 --> 01:09:19.320
<v Speaker 3>like a happy medium.</v>

2738
01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:22.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to come on this podcast later in life and I'll explain why.</v>

2739
01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm just learning so much right now.</v>

2740
01:09:25.091 --> 01:09:26.790
<v Speaker 3>None of us feel like it's overwhelming</v>

2741
01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:27.750
<v Speaker 4>or Smith,</v>

2742
01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:28.141
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2743
01:09:28.141 --> 01:09:28.921
<v Speaker 4>when I was your age,</v>

2744
01:09:28.921 --> 01:09:30.150
<v Speaker 4>I was a fucking idiot.</v>

2745
01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:30.811
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2746
01:09:30.811 --> 01:09:32.220
<v Speaker 4>you're way ahead of the game.</v>

2747
01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:33.750
<v Speaker 4>It's just a part of life.</v>

2748
01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:34.351
<v Speaker 4>It's he is,</v>

2749
01:09:34.351 --> 01:09:34.621
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2750
01:09:34.621 --> 01:09:38.540
<v Speaker 4>five years from now you've been in like God back then I didn't know shit and</v>

2751
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:39.620
<v Speaker 4>then five years later you'd be like,</v>

2752
01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:40.290
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

2753
01:09:40.290 --> 01:09:41.640
<v Speaker 4>back then I didn't know shit.</v>

2754
01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:42.591
<v Speaker 3>The more you learn,</v>

2755
01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:44.030
<v Speaker 3>the more you realize you don't know.</v>

2756
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:45.080
<v Speaker 3>And then we get mad at her</v>

2757
01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:45.971
<v Speaker 4>parents and stuff like,</v>

2758
01:09:45.971 --> 01:09:46.241
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

2759
01:09:46.241 --> 01:09:46.901
<v Speaker 4>please listen to me.</v>

2760
01:09:46.901 --> 01:09:47.441
<v Speaker 4>Eat healthy.</v>

2761
01:09:47.441 --> 01:09:48.490
<v Speaker 4>Like read books.</v>

2762
01:09:48.491 --> 01:09:48.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2763
01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:50.620
<v Speaker 4>her parents didn't grow up with the Internet.</v>

2764
01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:53.350
<v Speaker 4>Like we're so lucky to be learned from you guys.</v>

2765
01:09:53.830 --> 01:09:56.350
<v Speaker 4>It's just impossible to change people's ways.</v>

2766
01:09:56.351 --> 01:09:57.610
<v Speaker 4>They have to want to change.</v>

2767
01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.960
<v Speaker 4>They have to be motivated.</v>

2768
01:09:58.961 --> 01:09:59.381
<v Speaker 4>They have to.</v>

2769
01:09:59.381 --> 01:09:59.561
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2770
01:09:59.561 --> 01:10:01.510
<v Speaker 4>it's so hard to change people.</v>

2771
01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:04.810
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you've ever had a friend that's been into drugs and it's been all</v>

2772
01:10:04.811 --> 01:10:07.210
<v Speaker 4>fucked up and you can't get them to quit or an alcoholic,</v>

2773
01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:11.260
<v Speaker 4>it is almost impossible to talk someone into changing.</v>

2774
01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:14.110
<v Speaker 4>They have to have some motivation that's internal.</v>

2775
01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:14.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2776
01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:16.660
<v Speaker 4>And that's the same thing with eating good.</v>

2777
01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:20.470
<v Speaker 4>The best example you could set is by living your life in a healthy way.</v>

2778
01:10:20.530 --> 01:10:20.771
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2779
01:10:20.771 --> 01:10:21.340
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>

2780
01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:22.173
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2781
01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:24.400
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the best things about the internet.</v>

2782
01:10:24.401 --> 01:10:28.000
<v Speaker 4>You get to see all these people that are doing things in a healthy way and doing</v>

2783
01:10:28.001 --> 01:10:31.510
<v Speaker 4>things that are exciting and inspirational and then it makes you want to do</v>

2784
01:10:31.511 --> 01:10:32.100
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

2785
01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:32.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2786
01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:33.040
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>

2787
01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:33.410
<v Speaker 4>And wakes,</v>

2788
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:36.370
<v Speaker 4>makes you want to take care of your body and makes you really want to</v>

2789
01:10:36.371 --> 01:10:40.240
<v Speaker 4>concentrate on your mind and meditating and just really get everything in order.</v>

2790
01:10:40.490 --> 01:10:40.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2791
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:41.470
<v Speaker 3>meditation.</v>

2792
01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:42.261
<v Speaker 3>So awesome.</v>

2793
01:10:42.261 --> 01:10:46.130
<v Speaker 3>It's really helping me every morning I meditate for 10 minutes and I feel like</v>

2794
01:10:46.131 --> 01:10:50.120
<v Speaker 3>it's helping me throughout the day understand why certain thoughts are coming</v>

2795
01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:50.810
<v Speaker 3>up,</v>

2796
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:54.800
<v Speaker 3>whether it's from my childhood traumas or just anything,</v>

2797
01:10:54.801 --> 01:10:56.540
<v Speaker 3>just certain patterns,</v>

2798
01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:57.290
<v Speaker 3>my arm,</v>

2799
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:58.130
<v Speaker 3>cultural conditions,</v>

2800
01:10:58.131 --> 01:10:58.671
<v Speaker 3>thought patterns,</v>

2801
01:10:58.671 --> 01:10:59.421
<v Speaker 3>cultural conditioning.</v>

2802
01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Just meditating is helped me almost kind of slow my brain down and redirect my</v>

2803
01:11:03.531 --> 01:11:07.100
<v Speaker 3>thoughts if I get angry or something or if something covens understanding of why</v>

2804
01:11:07.101 --> 01:11:09.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting angry and I think I,</v>

2805
01:11:09.780 --> 01:11:10.281
<v Speaker 3>and I'm so,</v>

2806
01:11:10.281 --> 01:11:11.120
<v Speaker 3>cause I've been meditating.</v>

2807
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 3>I did it for the Terry on verified did for the honoree fight and I would do it</v>

2808
01:11:14.191 --> 01:11:15.690
<v Speaker 3>randomly or in camp.</v>

2809
01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:16.643
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do it all.</v>

2810
01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:17.520
<v Speaker 3>And then now I'm doing it.</v>

2811
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:19.740
<v Speaker 3>I want it to be a part of my life every morning.</v>

2812
01:11:19.741 --> 01:11:21.020
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing it for the last month alone.</v>

2813
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:22.320
<v Speaker 3>Do you do for 10 minutes?</v>

2814
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.280
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes every morning.</v>

2815
01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.480
<v Speaker 3>And now how do you do it?</v>

2816
01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2817
01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:25.800
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2818
01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.150
<v Speaker 3>I've been listening to Sam Harris,</v>

2819
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.630

2822
01:11:33.691 --> 01:11:34.081
<v Speaker 3>stress,</v>

2823
01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:34.681
<v Speaker 3>anxiety,</v>

2824
01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:35.514
<v Speaker 3>sleep,</v>

2825
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.781
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2826
01:11:36.781 --> 01:11:37.770
<v Speaker 3>positive thinking.</v>

2827
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:38.041

2842
01:11:55.111 --> 01:11:56.130
<v Speaker 3>My favorite thing I need to,</v>

2843
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:59.700
<v Speaker 3>I wish everyone would have a morning routine cause it's really like</v>

2844
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:01.890
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2845
01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:02.191

<v Speaker 3>And just don't have,</v>

2849

2850
01:12:07.471 --> 01:12:08.304
<v Speaker 3>up for a good day.</v>

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:09.323
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

2854
01:12:10.511 --> 01:12:11.230
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

2855
01:12:11.230 --> 01:12:16.230
<v Speaker 4>And routine John Danaher want wrote some really fascinating piece on his</v>

2856
01:12:16.751 --> 01:12:18.850
<v Speaker 4>Instagram about routine,</v>

2857
01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:22.370
<v Speaker 4>about how important it is if you're a great athlete.</v>

2858
01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:22.840
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2859
01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:24.610
<v Speaker 4>you find me a great athlete,</v>

2860
01:12:24.611 --> 01:12:29.350
<v Speaker 4>I'll find you someone who's life is governed by routine and that this is the way</v>

2861
01:12:29.351 --> 01:12:34.240
<v Speaker 4>to check progress and this is the way to constantly be moving towards your goal.</v>

2862
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:35.201
<v Speaker 4>And a,</v>

2863
01:12:35.201 --> 01:12:37.930
<v Speaker 4>I remember reading that and I said to myself,</v>

2864
01:12:37.931 --> 01:12:41.000
<v Speaker 4>this is something that I've always known but never vote.</v>

2865
01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:41.801
<v Speaker 4>Verbalize.</v>

2866
01:12:41.801 --> 01:12:42.630
<v Speaker 4>I've never said it.</v>

2867
01:12:42.630 --> 01:12:42.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2868
01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:44.710
<v Speaker 4>But it's something that I've always known like yeah,</v>

2869
01:12:44.711 --> 01:12:46.420
<v Speaker 4>like everybody who's really good.</v>

2870
01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:51.450
<v Speaker 4>I remember I were at a sports illustrated article a long time ago about who's</v>

2871
01:12:52.511 --> 01:12:57.190
<v Speaker 4>that fucking track and field guy who won the Olympics a bunch of times.</v>

2872
01:12:57.191 --> 01:12:58.660
<v Speaker 4>His name was something Moses,</v>

2873
01:12:59.290 --> 01:13:00.580
<v Speaker 4>I forget his name,</v>

2874
01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.160
<v Speaker 4>see you so you could find this guy's name.</v>

2875
01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:03.900
<v Speaker 4>It was something,</v>

2876
01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.820
<v Speaker 4>but he was like an elite track and field guy.</v>

2877
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:08.200
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2878
01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:09.371
<v Speaker 4>what's that?</v>

2879
01:13:09.371 --> 01:13:09.910
<v Speaker 4>Edwin Moses.</v>

2880
01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:10.630
<v Speaker 4>Edwin Moses.</v>

2881
01:13:10.630 --> 01:13:12.880
<v Speaker 4>He was a beast and just super,</v>

2882
01:13:12.881 --> 01:13:17.080
<v Speaker 4>super disciplined and I remember he had like this routine,</v>

2883
01:13:17.081 --> 01:13:21.070
<v Speaker 4>we had his notebook and he would lay his notebook out and write down all of his</v>

2884
01:13:21.071 --> 01:13:24.190
<v Speaker 4>different routes and he had this like Matt that he would lay down and he would</v>

2885
01:13:24.191 --> 01:13:25.960
<v Speaker 4>do his stretching routines and all this stuff.</v>

2886
01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.340
<v Speaker 4>And I remember thinking like,</v>

2887
01:13:27.370 --> 01:13:28.151
<v Speaker 4>Oh this guy,</v>

2888
01:13:28.151 --> 01:13:28.990
<v Speaker 4>this is his thing.</v>

2889
01:13:28.991 --> 01:13:30.220
<v Speaker 4>He does this all the time.</v>

2890
01:13:30.221 --> 01:13:31.031
<v Speaker 4>He just gets there.</v>

2891
01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:32.770
<v Speaker 4>He locks in and he does this.</v>

2892
01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.360
<v Speaker 4>And this was many,</v>

2893
01:13:34.361 --> 01:13:35.440
<v Speaker 4>many years ago.</v>

2894
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:38.530
<v Speaker 4>I might have even still been fighting when this was going on.</v>

2895
01:13:38.531 --> 01:13:40.360
<v Speaker 4>So I remember thinking about it going,</v>

2896
01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:41.111
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2897
01:13:41.111 --> 01:13:42.040
<v Speaker 4>like this kind of,</v>

2898
01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:45.670
<v Speaker 4>this is like what elite performers do when they,</v>

2899
01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:46.150
<v Speaker 4>when they,</v>

2900
01:13:46.150 --> 01:13:49.600
<v Speaker 4>when they're right at the Olympics track and field,</v>

2901
01:13:49.601 --> 01:13:50.740
<v Speaker 4>it's so fucking boring.</v>

2902
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:52.810
<v Speaker 4>You're doing the same shit you just running.</v>

2903
01:13:53.050 --> 01:13:54.370
<v Speaker 4>Like you have to have a mind that to me,</v>

2904
01:13:54.371 --> 01:13:58.420
<v Speaker 4>that steel to be able to do that same stupid shit every day to try to get an</v>

2905
01:13:58.421 --> 01:13:59.980
<v Speaker 4>extra 10th of a second here.</v>

2906
01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:00.391
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

2907
01:14:00.391 --> 01:14:01.480
<v Speaker 4>an eighth of a second there.</v>

2908
01:14:01.481 --> 01:14:02.410
<v Speaker 4>Fuck all that.</v>

2909
01:14:02.411 --> 01:14:02.980
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2910
01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.760
<v Speaker 4>But I remember thinking like it was too,</v>

2911
01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:09.970
<v Speaker 4>it was at the same time horrifying to me that someone would ever want to do the</v>

2912
01:14:09.971 --> 01:14:12.820
<v Speaker 4>same stupid shit and over again until they won a gold medal.</v>

2913
01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:13.811
<v Speaker 4>But at the same time,</v>

2914
01:14:13.811 --> 01:14:18.400
<v Speaker 4>massively impressive that this guy had this kind of iron will.</v>

2915
01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:23.670
<v Speaker 4>There it is every time Edwin Moses places feed on the blocks from 1977 and 1987</v>

2916
01:14:23.771 --> 01:14:24.940
<v Speaker 4>he wants Moses,</v>

2917
01:14:24.941 --> 01:14:28.000
<v Speaker 4>arguably the best hurdler ever won 122 races,</v>

2918
01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:32.980
<v Speaker 4>including a 107 consecutive finals and set world records in the 400 meter</v>

2919
01:14:32.981 --> 01:14:36.640
<v Speaker 4>hurdles four times within that 10 year span.</v>

2920
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:38.890
<v Speaker 4>His journey to the untouchable,</v>

2921
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:43.420
<v Speaker 4>to this untouchable level was marked by personal innovation and determination,</v>

2922
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:47.320
<v Speaker 4>proving that elite coaching and state of the art facilities are not required for</v>

2923
01:14:47.321 --> 01:14:49.240
<v Speaker 4>supreme athletic success.</v>

2924
01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:50.530
<v Speaker 4>And there was um,</v>

2925
01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:50.711
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2926
01:14:50.711 --> 01:14:53.230
<v Speaker 4>believe it was sports illustrated that had an article about this guy.</v>

2927
01:14:53.231 --> 01:14:58.231
<v Speaker 4>And I remember just seeing him how motivated I was seeing him stretching and</v>

2928
01:14:58.721 --> 01:15:01.630
<v Speaker 4>working out and going over his routine.</v>

2929
01:15:02.050 --> 01:15:03.640
<v Speaker 4>And I was thinking to myself like,</v>

2930
01:15:03.641 --> 01:15:04.301
<v Speaker 4>oh think about it.</v>

2931
01:15:04.301 --> 01:15:07.380
<v Speaker 4>Every time I worked out that like what would Moses to how it,</v>

2932
01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:08.080
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2933
01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.550
<v Speaker 4>how would Moses I got,</v>

2934
01:15:09.551 --> 01:15:09.781
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>

2935
01:15:09.781 --> 01:15:11.530
<v Speaker 4>I got to start writing shit down.</v>

2936
01:15:11.531 --> 01:15:15.010
<v Speaker 4>I've got to start really thinking about everything I do and I got to start</v>

2937
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:18.220
<v Speaker 4>putting it together on a daily basis like he does.</v>

2938
01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:19.600
<v Speaker 4>That's what Robert Falls,</v>

2939
01:15:19.601 --> 01:15:23.360
<v Speaker 4>his favorite formula you'd always say is consistency over time equals results</v>

2940
01:15:24.090 --> 01:15:24.510
<v Speaker 4>favorite.</v>

2941
01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:25.720
<v Speaker 4>And I got it tattooed on there.</v>

2942
01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:29.020
<v Speaker 4>And it's funny cause like once you get good at one thing you realize like fuck,</v>

2943
01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:30.370
<v Speaker 4>I could get good at anything.</v>

2944
01:15:30.371 --> 01:15:35.371
<v Speaker 4>And I know what it takes is fucking consistency to Miyamoto Musashi.</v>

2945
01:15:35.650 --> 01:15:37.390
<v Speaker 4>He wrote that in the book of five rings.</v>

2946
01:15:37.391 --> 01:15:39.040
<v Speaker 4>Once you understand the way broadly,</v>

2947
01:15:39.041 --> 01:15:40.270
<v Speaker 4>you will see it in all things.</v>

2948
01:15:40.271 --> 01:15:41.104
<v Speaker 4>Sweet.</v>

2949
01:15:41.130 --> 01:15:41.430
<v Speaker 4>Sweet.</v>

2950
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:42.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2951
01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:44.710
<v Speaker 4>And that's a dude who fought people without fucking sword.</v>

2952
01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:45.730
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

2953
01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:48.020
<v Speaker 4>That's this guy at dance.</v>

2954
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.903
<v Speaker 4>That's him.</v>

2955
01:15:49.310 --> 01:15:50.350
<v Speaker 4>That's Musashi.</v>

2956
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:51.583
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2957
01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:55.840
<v Speaker 4>I read that book when I was like 15 or 16 or something like that and he wrote it</v>

2958
01:15:55.841 --> 01:15:57.970
<v Speaker 4>in the 16 hundreds met Hailey.</v>

2959
01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2960
01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:02.200
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was the 14 hundreds I think it was the 14 hundreds now that I think</v>

2961
01:16:02.201 --> 01:16:02.870
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

2962
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:03.310
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

2963
01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:04.143
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2964
01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:04.361
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2965
01:16:04.361 --> 01:16:05.194
<v Speaker 4>He killed six.</v>

2966
01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.550
<v Speaker 4>That's what the six number six was.</v>

2967
01:16:06.551 --> 01:16:09.730
<v Speaker 4>He killed 60 people in one on one sword fights,</v>

2968
01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:11.350
<v Speaker 4>killed,</v>

2969
01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:12.370
<v Speaker 4>killed.</v>

2970
01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.680
<v Speaker 4>Who that in your mind set going into one of them?</v>

2971
01:16:14.681 --> 01:16:15.100
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2972
01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:17.140
<v Speaker 4>Well he was a master at that.</v>

2973
01:16:17.141 --> 01:16:17.291
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2974
01:16:17.291 --> 01:16:20.740
<v Speaker 4>his thing was so fascinating and I always recommend the book of five rings for</v>

2975
01:16:20.741 --> 01:16:22.810
<v Speaker 4>fighters because one of the things that it's,</v>

2976
01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:27.840
<v Speaker 4>it's so crazy about it is his thing was balanced is that you should be an</v>

2977
01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:29.553
<v Speaker 4>artist,</v>

2978
01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:30.790
<v Speaker 4>you should be a poet.</v>

2979
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.500
<v Speaker 4>You should be like,</v>

2980
01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:35.410
<v Speaker 4>you should understand how to write calligraphy like that.</v>

2981
01:16:35.411 --> 01:16:36.730
<v Speaker 4>All these things are connected.</v>

2982
01:16:36.731 --> 01:16:38.920
<v Speaker 4>You have to be in complete control of your mind.</v>

2983
01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.200
<v Speaker 4>You have to be in complete control of your emotions.</v>

2984
01:16:41.201 --> 01:16:45.850
<v Speaker 4>You have to have complete control of artistic expression and that this was like</v>

2985
01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:48.160
<v Speaker 4>the way to be a balance sword fighter.</v>

2986
01:16:48.490 --> 01:16:52.390
<v Speaker 4>Like his whole thing was that you can't have any bullshit in your game like as a</v>

2987
01:16:52.391 --> 01:16:53.290
<v Speaker 4>human being.</v>

2988
01:16:53.291 --> 01:16:58.210
<v Speaker 4>You can't have any bullshit because when you're dealing with one on one steel,</v>

2989
01:16:58.390 --> 01:17:02.860
<v Speaker 4>fucking swords whizzing through the air by trained murderers.</v>

2990
01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:03.671
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2991
01:17:03.671 --> 01:17:07.870
<v Speaker 4>he was the best at it and one of the reasons why he was the best at it was this</v>

2992
01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 4>strict adherence to this Samurai</v>

2993
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:12.440
<v Speaker 6>way that he was not just a warrior,</v>

2994
01:17:12.441 --> 01:17:14.000
<v Speaker 6>that to be a great warrior,</v>

2995
01:17:14.001 --> 01:17:17.450
<v Speaker 6>you also had to be great and all of these other things you had to have,</v>

2996
01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:19.610
<v Speaker 6>you had to have a balanced perspective.</v>

2997
01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:21.050
<v Speaker 6>You couldn't be a meathead,</v>

2998
01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:21.381
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2999
01:17:21.381 --> 01:17:24.650
<v Speaker 6>You couldn't bite down your mouthpiece and let the chips fall where they may.</v>

3000
01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.930
<v Speaker 6>That shit doesn't work with sword fighting son.</v>

3001
01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:27.950
<v Speaker 6>That's bullshit.</v>

3002
01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:30.110
<v Speaker 6>Like it just like you said about GSP,</v>

3003
01:17:30.111 --> 01:17:32.660
<v Speaker 6>like he's almost too smart.</v>

3004
01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:33.501
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>

3005
01:17:33.501 --> 01:17:33.801
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

3006
01:17:33.801 --> 01:17:34.370
<v Speaker 6>he sows.</v>

3007
01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:35.300
<v Speaker 6>He's too smart.</v>

3008
01:17:35.301 --> 01:17:36.260
<v Speaker 6>And sometimes in fighting,</v>

3009
01:17:36.261 --> 01:17:38.750
<v Speaker 6>just like the dumb meatheads go to a certain level,</v>

3010
01:17:38.751 --> 01:17:39.561
<v Speaker 6>but just like he said,</v>

3011
01:17:39.561 --> 01:17:40.281
<v Speaker 6>when you're real smart,</v>

3012
01:17:40.281 --> 01:17:41.480
<v Speaker 6>you can go to a whole new level.</v>

3013
01:17:41.481 --> 01:17:42.314
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3014
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.680
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>

3015
01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:45.710
<v Speaker 6>there's a benefit to being a meathead up to a certain point.</v>

3016
01:17:45.730 --> 01:17:46.190
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3017
01:17:46.190 --> 01:17:51.190
<v Speaker 6>Especially if you can take a punch because leaving the was a savage.</v>

3018
01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:54.560
<v Speaker 6>There's a perfect example when he met Anderson Silva,</v>

3019
01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:56.930
<v Speaker 6>Anderson was like not today son,</v>

3020
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.980
<v Speaker 6>not today.</v>

3021
01:17:58.130 --> 01:17:59.630
<v Speaker 6>Welcome to the next level.</v>

3022
01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:01.790
<v Speaker 6>Give me several levels.</v>

3023
01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:04.340
<v Speaker 6>You know that was brilliant.</v>

3024
01:18:04.341 --> 01:18:05.420
<v Speaker 6>Matchmaking by the way,</v>

3025
01:18:05.421 --> 01:18:09.320
<v Speaker 6>by Joel silver when they introduced Anderson and I was a giant Anderson fan</v>

3026
01:18:09.321 --> 01:18:14.321
<v Speaker 6>before he fuck cause I was watching him in pride where he was fighting well but</v>

3027
01:18:14.721 --> 01:18:15.180
<v Speaker 6>then I knew he,</v>

3028
01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:16.490
<v Speaker 6>I knew he was better than that.</v>

3029
01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:20.240
<v Speaker 6>He was going through a lot of bullshit and that's when he was with Moyie Thai</v>

3030
01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:23.510
<v Speaker 6>Dream Team and I think he had already left shoot to box at one point in time.</v>

3031
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:26.570
<v Speaker 6>But then he went over and fought in cage rage.</v>

3032
01:18:26.690 --> 01:18:31.100
<v Speaker 6>He fought in England and when he fought in England I was like Holy Shit.</v>

3033
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:33.530
<v Speaker 6>When you got to see when he fought George Rivera,</v>

3034
01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:34.790
<v Speaker 6>when he fought Lee Marie,</v>

3035
01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:39.500
<v Speaker 6>you got to see how God damn good Anderson really was when he was in his prime.</v>

3036
01:18:39.650 --> 01:18:41.210
<v Speaker 6>So when he came into the UFC,</v>

3037
01:18:41.211 --> 01:18:43.020
<v Speaker 6>he was already in his thirties you know,</v>

3038
01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.140
<v Speaker 6>and his first fight with leap,</v>

3039
01:18:44.141 --> 01:18:47.480
<v Speaker 6>and I want to say it was like 32 33 something like that.</v>

3040
01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:47.791
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3041
01:18:47.791 --> 01:18:51.990
<v Speaker 6>And it's oily and he let Chris Liebing on fire and I remember watching it and</v>

3042
01:18:51.991 --> 01:18:52.671
<v Speaker 6>then I was saying this,</v>

3043
01:18:52.671 --> 01:18:52.881
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

3044
01:18:52.881 --> 01:18:56.720
<v Speaker 6>this is the perfect opponent for Anderson Cause Lehman's an animal.</v>

3045
01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.070
<v Speaker 6>He's a fucking warrior,</v>

3046
01:18:58.071 --> 01:19:02.270
<v Speaker 6>is going to bite down as mouthpiece and come swinging and Anderson is going to</v>

3047
01:19:02.271 --> 01:19:07.271
<v Speaker 6>be 15 steps ahead of him dissecting him and different angles and degrees.</v>

3048
01:19:07.311 --> 01:19:11.390
<v Speaker 6>And as he comes forward he's just catching them bank bank stepping over here,</v>

3049
01:19:11.391 --> 01:19:11.960
<v Speaker 6>pop.</v>

3050
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:12.620
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

3051
01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:13.910
<v Speaker 6>And then it was over.</v>

3052
01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:15.230
<v Speaker 6>It was like real quick.</v>

3053
01:19:15.231 --> 01:19:17.840
<v Speaker 6>And that was the world's introduction to Anderson Silva.</v>

3054
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:19.040
<v Speaker 6>Fucking crazy.</v>

3055
01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:20.060
<v Speaker 6>Crazy mind.</v>

3056
01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:20.781
<v Speaker 6>If I take a whiz boys,</v>

3057
01:19:20.781 --> 01:19:20.931
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3058
01:19:20.931 --> 01:19:21.764
<v Speaker 6>please go ahead.</v>

3059
01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:22.341
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3060
01:19:22.341 --> 01:19:23.890
<v Speaker 6>Dude Anderson in his prime memes,</v>

3061
01:19:23.891 --> 01:19:25.550
<v Speaker 6>Som thin special,</v>

3062
01:19:25.551 --> 01:19:26.300
<v Speaker 6>he was,</v>

3063
01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:27.890
<v Speaker 6>he had achieved that state.</v>

3064
01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:28.221
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3065
01:19:28.221 --> 01:19:33.221
<v Speaker 6>there's this elusive state of total flow and he had achieved that against some</v>

3066
01:19:33.651 --> 01:19:35.090
<v Speaker 6>of the best fighters in the world.</v>

3067
01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.080
<v Speaker 6>You know when you see him when he was at his very best and I just feel very</v>

3068
01:19:39.081 --> 01:19:41.270
<v Speaker 6>fortunate to have been there to watch some of those fights.</v>

3069
01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:44.780
<v Speaker 6>I think fader in pride was probably,</v>

3070
01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:46.250
<v Speaker 6>it's like him and Anderson.</v>

3071
01:19:46.251 --> 01:19:48.380
<v Speaker 6>Those are the two all time greats of that era.</v>

3072
01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:49.010
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3073
01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:51.560
<v Speaker 6>And then mighty mouse who's the all time great of this era.</v>

3074
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:53.270
<v Speaker 6>But what,</v>

3075
01:19:53.271 --> 01:19:58.271
<v Speaker 6>what was so phenomenal about Anderson was that you would just watch him hit that</v>

3076
01:19:58.551 --> 01:19:59.480
<v Speaker 6>flow state.</v>

3077
01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:00.051
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3078
01:20:00.051 --> 01:20:00.380
<v Speaker 6>he would,</v>

3079
01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.150
<v Speaker 6>he would size guys up to,</v>

3080
01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:03.920
<v Speaker 6>you would see him move around.</v>

3081
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:07.070
<v Speaker 6>He would start moving around who test you a little bit move.</v>

3082
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:08.401
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3083
01:20:08.401 --> 01:20:10.410

3086
01:20:11.281 --> 01:20:12.330

3087
01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:14.900
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden he started opening it up on your like,</v>

3088
01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:15.870

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:23.580
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't thinking too much.</v>

3095
01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:24.450
<v Speaker 4>Well when he sent,</v>

3096
01:20:24.450 --> 01:20:25.950
<v Speaker 4>he tore up with that front kick.</v>

3097
01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.260
<v Speaker 4>Fucking God damn nasty,</v>

3098
01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:29.970
<v Speaker 4>nasty,</v>

3099
01:20:29.970 --> 01:20:30.390
<v Speaker 4>nasty.</v>

3100
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:31.260
<v Speaker 4>But he just caught,</v>

3101
01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:33.000
<v Speaker 4>he caught something to Vito was doing,</v>

3102
01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:34.770
<v Speaker 4>if he toiled fight squared up,</v>

3103
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:35.251
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3104
01:20:35.251 --> 01:20:35.961
<v Speaker 4>he's always squared.</v>

3105
01:20:35.961 --> 01:20:36.920
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about earlier,</v>

3106
01:20:36.930 --> 01:20:40.230
<v Speaker 4>he always fought sorta squared up because he would blitz guys and he always</v>

3107
01:20:40.231 --> 01:20:42.600
<v Speaker 4>wanted to be able to sprawl and shoot and take you down.</v>

3108
01:20:42.601 --> 01:20:44.550
<v Speaker 4>So he had a very squared up style,</v>

3109
01:20:44.551 --> 01:20:46.740
<v Speaker 4>which made him open here and open here.</v>

3116
01:20:51.121 --> 01:20:53.790
<v Speaker 4>John dropped him with the front leg side kick to the body,</v>

3117
01:20:54.890 --> 01:20:55.561
<v Speaker 4>if you remember that.</v>

3118
01:20:55.561 --> 01:20:56.040

3121
01:21:00.631 --> 01:21:03.690
<v Speaker 4>And John hit him with a front leg side kick right to the solar plexus and</v>

3122
01:21:03.691 --> 01:21:04.290

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:30.750
<v Speaker 4>It's Craig in a fight again.</v>

3148
01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:31.620
<v Speaker 4>You think John,</v>

3149
01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.153
<v Speaker 4>I hope soon.</v>

3150
01:21:33.450 --> 01:21:34.350
<v Speaker 4>Who is kicking?</v>

3151
01:21:34.351 --> 01:21:35.850
<v Speaker 4>Alistair Overeem straight down the middle.</v>

3152
01:21:35.851 --> 01:21:38.550
<v Speaker 4>They were talking about his square stance and they knew that would be open,</v>

3153
01:21:38.970 --> 01:21:41.640
<v Speaker 4>knocked out Alastair with those front kicks in the UFC.</v>

3154
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:42.420
<v Speaker 4>That's all.</v>

3155
01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:43.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3156
01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:43.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3157
01:21:43.470 --> 01:21:44.920
<v Speaker 4>I remember Greg Jackson talking about that.</v>

3158
01:21:45.810 --> 01:21:50.400
<v Speaker 4>Travis got back from being fucking badly hurt in that fight.</v>

3159
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:51.240
<v Speaker 4>You remember that?</v>

3160
01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:51.451
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3161
01:21:51.451 --> 01:21:53.280
<v Speaker 4>Travis was battered in that fight.</v>

3162
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:54.870
<v Speaker 4>His body was getting fucked up.</v>

3163
01:21:54.871 --> 01:21:57.150
<v Speaker 4>Allister was blasted him in the body with knees.</v>

3164
01:21:57.390 --> 01:22:00.750
<v Speaker 4>Travis was almost out of it and just gutted it out.</v>

3165
01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:05.780
<v Speaker 4>I still to this day feel like he somehow or another missed his,</v>

3166
01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:08.430
<v Speaker 4>his path.</v>

3167
01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:09.391
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3168
01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:10.440
<v Speaker 4>I feel like Travis,</v>

3169
01:22:10.441 --> 01:22:11.520
<v Speaker 4>when he was on,</v>

3170
01:22:11.521 --> 01:22:13.440
<v Speaker 4>when he knocked out Stephan Struve,</v>

3171
01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:14.161
<v Speaker 4>when you see,</v>

3172
01:22:14.161 --> 01:22:14.760
<v Speaker 4>when he was,</v>

3173
01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.290
<v Speaker 4>he used to fight different man.</v>

3174
01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.610
<v Speaker 4>He was switching around.</v>

3175
01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:18.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3176
01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:18.870
<v Speaker 4>switched gyms.</v>

3177
01:22:18.870 --> 01:22:19.920
<v Speaker 4>When he's with Jackson's,</v>

3178
01:22:19.921 --> 01:22:21.330
<v Speaker 4>he was moving around a lot.</v>

3179
01:22:21.330 --> 01:22:24.030
<v Speaker 4>He was light on his feet for whatever reason,</v>

3180
01:22:24.031 --> 01:22:24.680
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3181
01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:29.400
<v Speaker 4>Can you decided to switch gyms and became more boxers style,</v>

3182
01:22:29.401 --> 01:22:30.410
<v Speaker 4>flat footed.</v>

3183
01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:34.470
<v Speaker 4>But I also think sometimes guys get to the point where they just don't want to</v>

3184
01:22:34.471 --> 01:22:35.430
<v Speaker 4>do it anymore.</v>

3185
01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:36.900
<v Speaker 4>Or if they do want to do it,</v>

3186
01:22:36.901 --> 01:22:37.621
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to do it.</v>

3187
01:22:37.621 --> 01:22:38.790
<v Speaker 4>Like they used to want to do it.</v>

3188
01:22:38.791 --> 01:22:39.900
<v Speaker 4>They kind of want to do it.</v>

3189
01:22:39.901 --> 01:22:43.110
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they kind of want to pay day or maybe they just want to win so they feel</v>

3190
01:22:43.111 --> 01:22:43.861
<v Speaker 4>better again.</v>

3191
01:22:43.861 --> 01:22:45.540
<v Speaker 4>And then they'll pump themselves up again.</v>

3192
01:22:45.541 --> 01:22:46.920
<v Speaker 4>And maybe I just get this one wind,</v>

3193
01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:48.300
<v Speaker 4>I'll get back on track.</v>

3194
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:49.050
<v Speaker 4>But that,</v>

3195
01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:53.690
<v Speaker 4>that weird space of not knowing my,</v>

3196
01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:53.931
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3197
01:22:53.931 --> 01:22:54.180
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

3198
01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:54.271
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3199
01:22:54.271 --> 01:22:59.271
<v Speaker 4>warrior am I looking to get out and my look into that weird space is the worst</v>

3200
01:22:59.431 --> 01:23:00.570
<v Speaker 4>place it is.</v>

3201
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:01.770
<v Speaker 4>It's the worst place.</v>

3202
01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.120
<v Speaker 4>Fight.</v>

3203
01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:04.080
<v Speaker 4>Fighting is just so fucking tough too.</v>

3204
01:23:04.081 --> 01:23:05.010
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what's going on.</v>

3205
01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:05.200
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

3206
01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.070
<v Speaker 4>they could eat something.</v>

3207
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:07.750
<v Speaker 5>They could have thought about puke in the whole night,</v>

3208
01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:08.141
<v Speaker 5>could,</v>

3209
01:23:08.141 --> 01:23:08.510
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3210
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:09.760
<v Speaker 5>there's so much.</v>

3211
01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:11.121
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3212
01:23:11.121 --> 01:23:11.700
<v Speaker 5>I can see that.</v>

3213
01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:14.350
<v Speaker 5>Girlfriend problems could have family problems,</v>

3214
01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:15.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3215
01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:15.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3216
01:23:15.850 --> 01:23:18.160
<v Speaker 5>but I feel like Travis at his best,</v>

3217
01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:20.200
<v Speaker 5>there was moments in his career where I was like,</v>

3218
01:23:20.230 --> 01:23:21.063
<v Speaker 5>this guy,</v>

3219
01:23:21.190 --> 01:23:22.420
<v Speaker 5>I used to call them the dark horse.</v>

3220
01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:22.901
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

3221
01:23:22.901 --> 01:23:24.670
<v Speaker 5>that guy's the dark horse of the heavyweight division.</v>

3222
01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:25.840
<v Speaker 5>He might be the champ one day.</v>

3223
01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:27.370
<v Speaker 5>People are sleeping on him,</v>

3224
01:23:27.610 --> 01:23:28.840
<v Speaker 5>but the movement,</v>

3225
01:23:28.841 --> 01:23:30.750
<v Speaker 5>that guy had four fucking heavyweight.</v>

3226
01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:31.150
<v Speaker 5>He was,</v>

3227
01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:35.290
<v Speaker 5>he would see him switch and stances and almost like TJ style movement flowing</v>

3228
01:23:35.300 --> 01:23:35.741
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

3229
01:23:35.741 --> 01:23:36.910
<v Speaker 5>Giant dude,</v>

3230
01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:37.744
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3231
01:23:37.750 --> 01:23:38.021
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3232
01:23:38.021 --> 01:23:39.700
<v Speaker 5>Those deer legs when they got going though,</v>

3233
01:23:39.701 --> 01:23:40.270
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

3234
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:40.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3235
01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:41.231
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3236
01:23:41.231 --> 01:23:42.250
<v Speaker 5>That was a problem too.</v>

3237
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:44.280
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3238
01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.450
<v Speaker 5>that fight with our Lawsky.</v>

3239
01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:48.160
<v Speaker 5>That was probably when I was convinced that,</v>

3240
01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:48.461
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3241
01:23:48.461 --> 01:23:52.210
<v Speaker 5>like maybe like the best times of past him because just,</v>

3242
01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:52.890
<v Speaker 5>I could,</v>

3243
01:23:52.890 --> 01:23:53.620
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

3244
01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:54.960
<v Speaker 5>I guess him in our last few,</v>

3245
01:23:54.961 --> 01:23:57.280
<v Speaker 5>sparred a lot at Jackson's and our Lawsky,</v>

3246
01:23:57.490 --> 01:24:02.350
<v Speaker 5>although he's had a lot of wars and had a lot of losses and been stopped a lot</v>

3247
01:24:02.351 --> 01:24:02.940
<v Speaker 5>of times.</v>

3248
01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:04.510
<v Speaker 5>You've got to remember at one point in time,</v>

3249
01:24:04.511 --> 01:24:07.750
<v Speaker 5>our [inaudible] was a real world class fighter,</v>

3250
01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:12.400
<v Speaker 5>a heavyweight champion who everybody was terrified of when he knocked out Paulb</v>

3251
01:24:12.401 --> 01:24:13.870
<v Speaker 5>when Tello back in those days,</v>

3252
01:24:13.871 --> 01:24:14.081
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3253
01:24:14.081 --> 01:24:16.780
<v Speaker 5>he had a piston of a right hand just boom,</v>

3254
01:24:16.781 --> 01:24:18.160
<v Speaker 5>just throw it straight down the middle.</v>

3255
01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:19.990
<v Speaker 5>And he was still skillful guy.</v>

3256
01:24:19.991 --> 01:24:22.780
<v Speaker 5>So apparently in sparring he would get the best of Travis.</v>

3257
01:24:22.781 --> 01:24:24.100
<v Speaker 5>So like when they got together,</v>

3258
01:24:24.101 --> 01:24:26.200
<v Speaker 5>like he had like serious confidence in that fight.</v>

3259
01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:28.780
<v Speaker 5>That was a slobber knocker do you remember that fire?</v>

3260
01:24:29.290 --> 01:24:31.150
<v Speaker 5>One round of full chaos.</v>

3261
01:24:31.330 --> 01:24:32.740
<v Speaker 5>Both guys got dropped.</v>

3262
01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:36.670
<v Speaker 5>It was one of the craziest one round heavyweight fights of all time and our</v>

3263
01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:37.930
<v Speaker 5>Laskey wind up stopping them.</v>

3264
01:24:38.210 --> 01:24:38.830
<v Speaker 5>It's so,</v>

3265
01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:41.890
<v Speaker 5>it's so hard to pick those heavyweight fights like any fight,</v>

3266
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:43.660
<v Speaker 5>whoever lands first,</v>

3267
01:24:43.661 --> 01:24:44.494
<v Speaker 5>you never know.</v>

3268
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:45.400
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3269
01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:46.233

3270
01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:47.380
<v Speaker 5>who do you think's gonna win?</v>

3271
01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:47.951
<v Speaker 5>It's like fuck.</v>

3272
01:24:47.951 --> 01:24:48.784
<v Speaker 5>Who the fuck knows?</v>

3273
01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:50.801
<v Speaker 5>What do you guys think of this?</v>

01:25:10.450 --> 01:25:11.111
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

3291
01:25:11.111 --> 01:25:12.100
<v Speaker 5>World class fighter,</v>

3292
01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:17.320
<v Speaker 5>but other than that really hasn't beaten big name guys and he's fighting for the</v>

3293
01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:17.951
<v Speaker 5>interim title.</v>

3294
01:25:17.951 --> 01:25:21.310
<v Speaker 5>You've got to think that a lot of that is because he's been very smart with</v>

3295
01:25:21.311 --> 01:25:22.030
<v Speaker 5>promotion.</v>

3296
01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:23.050
<v Speaker 5>Telia had to hook.</v>

3297
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.921
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah man.</v>

3298
01:25:23.921 --> 01:25:24.520
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>

3299
01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:25.240
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

3300
01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:27.370
<v Speaker 5>That's going to be New Jersey for that.</v>

3301
01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:28.233
<v Speaker 5>I don't have anybody,</v>

3302
01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:28.451
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

3303
01:25:28.451 --> 01:25:29.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm in that same what we just said.</v>

3304
01:25:29.890 --> 01:25:30.790
<v Speaker 5>Who the fuck knows?</v>

3305
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:31.450
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3306
01:25:31.450 --> 01:25:31.930
<v Speaker 5>I liked,</v>

3307
01:25:31.930 --> 01:25:33.820
<v Speaker 5>I liked the matchup though because Colby,</v>

3308
01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:34.850
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

3309
01:25:34.850 --> 01:25:37.870
<v Speaker 5>Colby is not making one 55 unless he cuts a fucking leg off.</v>

3310
01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:39.040
<v Speaker 5>He's a bigger guy.</v>

3311
01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:41.500
<v Speaker 5>Rda was the 155 pound champion,</v>

3312
01:25:41.501 --> 01:25:42.281
<v Speaker 5>so you have to think.</v>

3313
01:25:42.281 --> 01:25:43.780
<v Speaker 5>Colby is going to have a size advantage.</v>

3314
01:25:43.781 --> 01:25:45.130
<v Speaker 5>Colby is a very good wrestler.</v>

3315
01:25:45.370 --> 01:25:49.930
<v Speaker 5>He's relentless and he managed to do something that very few people been able to</v>

3316
01:25:49.931 --> 01:25:52.720
<v Speaker 5>do with Maya where he'd just overwhelmed him,</v>

3317
01:25:52.870 --> 01:25:53.561
<v Speaker 5>beat him up,</v>

3318
01:25:53.561 --> 01:25:53.931
<v Speaker 5>beat him up,</v>

3319
01:25:53.931 --> 01:25:57.880
<v Speaker 5>standing controlled where the fight took place when a clear cut decision did it</v>

3320
01:25:57.881 --> 01:26:01.900
<v Speaker 5>in Brazil and did it after Woodley did it and did it arguably better than</v>

3321
01:26:01.901 --> 01:26:02.730
<v Speaker 5>Woodley did it,</v>

3322
01:26:02.730 --> 01:26:03.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3323
01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 5>was on top of Maya.</v>

3324
01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:07.640
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't avoiding him in the in a way that Woodley did,</v>

3325
01:26:07.641 --> 01:26:08.870
<v Speaker 6>but Whitley was injured in that fight.</v>

3326
01:26:08.871 --> 01:26:10.370
<v Speaker 6>He hurt his shoulder like in the first round.</v>

3327
01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:12.770
<v Speaker 6>But it was an impressive performance.</v>

3328
01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:17.630
<v Speaker 6>I mean if you go back and watch what my was able to do with like Rick story with</v>

3329
01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:20.180
<v Speaker 6>my has been able to do with Matt Brown,</v>

3330
01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:23.900
<v Speaker 6>Maya's a fucking monster when he gets a hold of you,</v>

3331
01:26:23.901 --> 01:26:28.130
<v Speaker 6>it's such next level Jujitsu and Colby was really never in trouble in that</v>

3332
01:26:28.131 --> 01:26:28.610
<v Speaker 6>fight.</v>

3333
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:29.960
<v Speaker 6>So you have to look at that and you go,</v>

3334
01:26:29.961 --> 01:26:30.530
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

3335
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:33.140
<v Speaker 6>well obviously he has fantastic defense,</v>

3336
01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:38.120
<v Speaker 6>solid wrestling base can strike on the fee and knows how to like knows how to</v>

3337
01:26:38.121 --> 01:26:39.320
<v Speaker 6>fight a grimy,</v>

3338
01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:40.490
<v Speaker 6>nasty fight.</v>

3339
01:26:40.670 --> 01:26:41.690
<v Speaker 6>And he's the bigger guy.</v>

3340
01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:47.020
<v Speaker 6>But then you look at Rda and Rda at lightweight was a fucking mauler was just</v>

3341
01:26:47.691 --> 01:26:48.620
<v Speaker 6>Merkin people.</v>

3342
01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:49.220
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3343
01:26:49.220 --> 01:26:51.440
<v Speaker 6>But then you look at him at at welterweight and you're like,</v>

3344
01:26:51.441 --> 01:26:52.011
<v Speaker 6>Jesus,</v>

3345
01:26:52.011 --> 01:26:53.530
<v Speaker 6>he might be better at welterweight.</v>

3346
01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.730
<v Speaker 6>Look how good he looked against Neil Magni.</v>

3347
01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:57.380
<v Speaker 6>Everybody struggles with Neil Magni.</v>

3348
01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:58.950
<v Speaker 6>He smashed Neil Magni,</v>

3349
01:26:58.951 --> 01:26:59.784
<v Speaker 6>took them down,</v>

3350
01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:00.651
<v Speaker 6>leg kicked him,</v>

3351
01:27:00.651 --> 01:27:01.221
<v Speaker 6>dropped him,</v>

3352
01:27:01.221 --> 01:27:01.971
<v Speaker 6>get on top of them,</v>

3353
01:27:01.971 --> 01:27:02.804
<v Speaker 6>strangle him.</v>

3354
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:03.291
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3355
01:27:03.291 --> 01:27:05.030
<v Speaker 6>he beat the shit out of Robbie Lawler.</v>

3356
01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.950
<v Speaker 6>The Robbie Lawler fight was crazy.</v>

3357
01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:11.270
<v Speaker 6>Like he just overwhelmed one of the best strikers in the welterweight division.</v>

3358
01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:14.210
<v Speaker 6>Overwhelmed in from the outside with angles and technique.</v>

3359
01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.480
<v Speaker 6>So it's interesting men.</v>

3360
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:18.051
<v Speaker 6>It's very,</v>

3361
01:27:18.051 --> 01:27:18.771
<v Speaker 6>very interesting.</v>

3362
01:27:18.771 --> 01:27:19.640
<v Speaker 6>It's very interesting.</v>

3363
01:27:19.690 --> 01:27:21.380
<v Speaker 6>Some that aren't in Conor never fought.</v>

3364
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.740
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

3365
01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.380

3366
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:25.910

3367
01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:27.650
<v Speaker 6>Broke his fucking phone.</v>

3368
01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:29.590
<v Speaker 6>You know he's going to be a problem for a lot of people.</v>

<v Speaker 6>but the fuck outta here with that.</v>

3434
01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:54.620
<v Speaker 6>I was always doing this and curled my hair last fight.</v>

3435
01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:55.551
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

3449
01:29:08.630 --> 01:29:09.030
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3450
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.451
<v Speaker 3>she really,</v>

3451
01:29:09.451 --> 01:29:10.620
<v Speaker 3>and she doesn't play it up at all,</v>

3452
01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:11.743
<v Speaker 3>which is yeah.</v>

3453
01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:12.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3454
01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:13.080
<v Speaker 3>she's cool.</v>

3455
01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:13.913
<v Speaker 3>Super honest.</v>

3456
01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:16.860
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be interesting for who we get for sugar next.</v>

3457
01:29:16.980 --> 01:29:18.750
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's probably gonna be a five rounder.</v>

3458
01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:20.340
<v Speaker 3>Well not what I was thinking.</v>

3459
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:22.740
<v Speaker 3>Cause I'm originally after that last fight,</v>

3460
01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:24.840
<v Speaker 3>after that last fight when we went to the hospital,</v>

3461
01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:25.910
<v Speaker 3>the Ama,</v>

3462
01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:27.150
<v Speaker 3>the post fight conference,</v>

3463
01:29:27.151 --> 01:29:27.800
<v Speaker 3>Dana White took,</v>

3464
01:29:27.800 --> 01:29:28.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3465
01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:31.310
<v Speaker 3>they said John's fight foot's fine because at the hospital they said there was</v>

3466
01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:34.290
<v Speaker 3>nothing wrong with my foot and the Dana Psych said that.</v>

3467
01:29:34.291 --> 01:29:35.430
<v Speaker 3>So I was thinking like,</v>

3468
01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:35.611
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3469
01:29:35.611 --> 01:29:35.821
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3470
01:29:35.821 --> 01:29:36.750
<v Speaker 3>I guess nothing drawn my foot.</v>

3471
01:29:36.751 --> 01:29:39.540
<v Speaker 3>I guess I'm going to fight because they x rayed it with my foot up.</v>

3472
01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:39.721
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

3473
01:29:39.721 --> 01:29:40.980
<v Speaker 3>I get not flat on the surface.</v>

3474
01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:42.030
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3475
01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:43.680
<v Speaker 3>so I suppose we're going to fight July six.</v>

3476
01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:46.590
<v Speaker 3>I was going a headline that card at us at a Sonia,</v>

3477
01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:48.120
<v Speaker 3>Sonia,</v>

3478
01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:49.440
<v Speaker 3>he's headlining that card.</v>

3479
01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:52.920
<v Speaker 3>I was supposed to I suppose to a headline that car and I was so excited for</v>

3480
01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:53.640
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3481
01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:54.473
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3482
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:55.680
<v Speaker 3>so that because they wanted me to headline,</v>

3483
01:29:55.681 --> 01:29:58.470
<v Speaker 3>but I think next fight is going to be October 6th in Vegas,</v>

3484
01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:59.313
<v Speaker 3>the paper view.</v>

3485
01:29:59.630 --> 01:30:00.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3486
01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:01.740
<v Speaker 3>hopefully you get to get on that card.</v>

3487
01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:03.660
<v Speaker 3>But then after that I would like to headline my own.</v>

3488
01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:04.913
<v Speaker 3>Oh sweet.</v>

3489
01:30:05.250 --> 01:30:08.910
<v Speaker 3>So I would like to fight two more times by the end of the year Hulings</v>

3490
01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:09.780
<v Speaker 3>everything's going good.</v>

3491
01:30:09.781 --> 01:30:12.420
<v Speaker 3>So I think October six and then maybe November,</v>

3492
01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:13.150
<v Speaker 3>December.</v>

3493
01:30:13.150 --> 01:30:14.000
<v Speaker 3>So you sweet.</v>

3494
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:17.010
<v Speaker 3>How do you decide when you're ready to go?</v>

3495
01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:18.540
<v Speaker 3>Full blast again with your foot.</v>

3496
01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:19.453
<v Speaker 3>Just bow.</v>

3497
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:22.130
<v Speaker 3>Do you go to a doctor and get it looked at again?</v>

3498
01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:22.850
<v Speaker 3>Get an MRI,</v>

3499
01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:23.920
<v Speaker 3>make sure everything's back in place.</v>

3500
01:30:23.930 --> 01:30:24.210
<v Speaker 3>Got A,</v>

3501
01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:27.240
<v Speaker 3>I got an x ray last time and they said everything looks good.</v>

3502
01:30:27.550 --> 01:30:29.370
<v Speaker 3>Come back and four weeks and we'll clear you.</v>

3503
01:30:29.371 --> 01:30:30.300
<v Speaker 3>But I'm really just,</v>

3504
01:30:30.301 --> 01:30:31.134
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to listen to,</v>

3505
01:30:31.810 --> 01:30:32.070
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3506
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:35.670
<v Speaker 3>I know how my foot feels like there's days where it's really sore and there's</v>

3507
01:30:35.671 --> 01:30:36.151
<v Speaker 3>days I'm like,</v>

3508
01:30:36.151 --> 01:30:36.331

<v Speaker 3>it's good.</v>

3510
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:37.800
<v Speaker 3>But I know it's just,</v>

3511
01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:38.521
<v Speaker 3>I feel like,</v>

3512
01:30:38.521 --> 01:30:38.821
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

3513
01:30:38.821 --> 01:30:39.271
<v Speaker 3>about 80,</v>

3514
01:30:39.271 --> 01:30:40.104
<v Speaker 3>85%,</v>

3515
01:30:40.110 --> 01:30:40.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3516
01:30:40.610 --> 01:30:41.130
<v Speaker 3>and be like,</v>

3517
01:30:41.130 --> 01:30:41.431
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3518
01:30:41.431 --> 01:30:42.264
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

3519
01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:43.140
<v Speaker 3>today it's a little,</v>

3520
01:30:43.170 --> 01:30:43.401
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

3521
01:30:43.401 --> 01:30:44.820
<v Speaker 3>so we hit mits yesterday,</v>

3522
01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:45.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3523
01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.111
<v Speaker 3>and I lifted yesterday,</v>

3524
01:30:46.111 --> 01:30:47.130
<v Speaker 3>so it's a little bit sore,</v>

3525
01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:48.150
<v Speaker 3>but it's like a,</v>

3526
01:30:48.150 --> 01:30:49.530
<v Speaker 3>it's like a sore from not using it,</v>

3527
01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:51.450
<v Speaker 3>not like a sore from Osha injury.</v>

3528
01:30:51.451 --> 01:30:51.870
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3529
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:52.670
<v Speaker 3>So I think it's,</v>

3530
01:30:52.670 --> 01:30:52.950
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3531
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:53.491
<v Speaker 3>it's been Heelan.</v>

3532
01:30:53.491 --> 01:30:53.911
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

3533
01:30:53.911 --> 01:30:54.511
<v Speaker 3>I think everything,</v>

3534
01:30:54.511 --> 01:30:55.560
<v Speaker 3>I've been doing everything right.</v>

3535
01:30:55.561 --> 01:30:56.020
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3536
01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:56.610
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3537
01:30:56.610 --> 01:30:57.301
<v Speaker 3>I would say at three,</v>

3538
01:30:57.301 --> 01:30:57.871
<v Speaker 3>four more weeks,</v>

3539
01:30:57.871 --> 01:30:59.130
<v Speaker 3>I'll be ready to go 100%.</v>

3540
01:30:59.670 --> 01:31:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Did you see the Marlin Mariah's fight?</v>

3541
01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:01.920
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3542
01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:02.221
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

3543
01:31:02.221 --> 01:31:03.240
<v Speaker 3>I seen the highlight of it.</v>

3544
01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:05.220
<v Speaker 3>So it pretty much the whole fight was the 34 seconds,</v>

3545
01:31:05.250 --> 01:31:10.250
<v Speaker 3>height ood beautiful switch switch kit that much just because they're so like</v>

3546
01:31:10.980 --> 01:31:12.360
<v Speaker 3>the person has to be coming forward.</v>

3547
01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:13.680
<v Speaker 3>The distance and MMA,</v>

3548
01:31:13.710 --> 01:31:15.510
<v Speaker 3>so much different than kickboxing and stuff.</v>

3549
01:31:15.511 --> 01:31:15.950
<v Speaker 3>We'll switch.</v>

3550
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:17.730
<v Speaker 3>Cars aren't that great.</v>

3551
01:31:17.731 --> 01:31:18.301
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>

3552
01:31:18.301 --> 01:31:18.420

<v Speaker 3>I kids fucking lightning.</v>

3554
01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.060
<v Speaker 3>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

3555
01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:21.923
<v Speaker 3>How tall is he?</v>

3556
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:23.090
<v Speaker 3>Short.</v>

3557
01:31:23.090 --> 01:31:23.301
<v Speaker 3>Five.</v>

3558
01:31:23.301 --> 01:31:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Five or something like that.</v>

3559
01:31:24.841 --> 01:31:25.531
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't be able to touch.</v>

3560
01:31:25.531 --> 01:31:26.341
<v Speaker 3>And Jimmy Rivera,</v>

3561
01:31:26.341 --> 01:31:26.601
<v Speaker 3>what is,</v>

3562
01:31:26.601 --> 01:31:27.510
<v Speaker 3>he's a little shorter than him.</v>

3563
01:31:28.170 --> 01:31:29.600
<v Speaker 3>They're both around the same side.</v>

3564
01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:29.911
<v Speaker 3>Five,</v>

3565
01:31:29.911 --> 01:31:31.320
<v Speaker 3>six in that range.</v>

3566
01:31:31.321 --> 01:31:31.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to give,</v>

3567
01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to give all these dudes trouble.</v>

3568
01:31:33.241 --> 01:31:34.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna be so long.</v>

3569
01:31:34.830 --> 01:31:35.300
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to get,</v>

3570
01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:35.590
<v Speaker 3>they're going to,</v>

3571
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:36.421
<v Speaker 3>you can't train for you.</v>

3572
01:31:36.421 --> 01:31:37.254
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

3573
01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:40.540
<v Speaker 3>We can't train for you cause there's not many people can swim.</v>

3574
01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:42.900
<v Speaker 3>I love about going into all my fights out there.</v>

3575
01:31:42.901 --> 01:31:45.570
<v Speaker 3>So confident and just cause I feel like you can watch me on TV.</v>

3576

<v Speaker 3>but not now.</v>

3831
01:37:05.711 --> 01:37:07.230
<v Speaker 3>They're not sending us their UFC.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was going to go to Singapore for the Singapore Card or Singapore.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3835
01:37:13.421 --> 01:37:14.960
<v Speaker 3>but sorry to um,</v>

3836
01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.020
<v Speaker 3>they said that you can get tested randomly off the street for,</v>

3837
01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:22.150
<v Speaker 3>for weed and you can go to prison.</v>

3838
01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:24.790
<v Speaker 3>Why so UFC decided not to send me,</v>

3839
01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:25.660
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

3840
01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:27.310
<v Speaker 3>Who randomly tests you?</v>

3841
01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:30.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that my manager called me and they said,</v>

3842
01:37:30.041 --> 01:37:33.010
<v Speaker 3>hey UFC at a little meeting they said they decided not to bring,</v>

3843
01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:34.480
<v Speaker 3>they don't really want you to go down there.</v>

3844
01:37:34.670 --> 01:37:37.540
<v Speaker 3>You can get tested randomly and go to prison if you test for weed.</v>

3845
01:37:37.570 --> 01:37:38.000
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

3846
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:38.720
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

3847
01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:38.840
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

3848
01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:39.431
<v Speaker 4>we're not going but,</v>

3849
01:37:39.431 --> 01:37:39.860
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3850
01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:41.030
<v Speaker 4>but here's the reality.</v>

3851
01:37:41.090 --> 01:37:45.450
<v Speaker 4>That means that literally like 70% of the UFC fucking roster could go out and</v>

3852
01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:46.360
<v Speaker 4>test it for weeding.</v>

3853
01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:46.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3854
01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:47.180
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

3855
01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:48.013
<v Speaker 4>All the coaches,</v>

3856
01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:49.070
<v Speaker 4>but what?</v>

3857
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:49.820
<v Speaker 4>We're going to Canada,</v>

3858
01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:50.061
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

3859
01:37:50.061 --> 01:37:51.050
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't that funny man.</v>

3860
01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:53.600
<v Speaker 4>That's a thing about the misconception about marijuana.</v>

3861
01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:55.141
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3862
01:37:55.141 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 4>people think like,</v>

3863
01:37:55.920 --> 01:38:00.920
<v Speaker 4>oh stoners are lazy and it's like a giant percentage of the UFC roster smoked</v>

3864
01:38:01.621 --> 01:38:03.480
<v Speaker 4>pot on a fairly regular basis.</v>

3865
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:06.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean even NFL and sports in general.</v>

3869
01:38:11.310 --> 01:38:12.570

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:14.610
<v Speaker 4>God Damn fucking everybody shoes that.</v>

3871
01:38:14.611 --> 01:38:15.361
<v Speaker 4>I have a buddy of mine,</v>

3872
01:38:15.361 --> 01:38:18.120
<v Speaker 4>my friend Aaron and he was taking Ibuprofen.</v>

3873
01:38:18.121 --> 01:38:19.080
<v Speaker 4>He was taking it all the time.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He stopped taking that shit.</v>

3878
01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:22.111
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

3879
01:38:22.111 --> 01:38:27.111
<v Speaker 4>just get some CBD and just take it orally and then also rub it on whatever's</v>

3880
01:38:27.181 --> 01:38:28.014
<v Speaker 4>bothering you.</v>

3881
01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:29.260
<v Speaker 4>And he did.</v>

3882
01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:29.611
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

3883
01:38:29.611 --> 01:38:29.880
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

3884
01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:30.661

01:38:30.661 --> 01:38:31.470
<v Speaker 4>no pain.</v>

3886
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:31.950
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

3887
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:35.460
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I've been taking this fucking Ibuprofen forever and now he's</v>

3888
01:38:35.461 --> 01:38:36.690
<v Speaker 4>just taking CBD oil.</v>

3889
01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:37.500
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

3890
01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:37.861
<v Speaker 4>Nothing,</v>

3891
01:38:37.861 --> 01:38:38.850
<v Speaker 4>nothing negative.</v>

3892
01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:39.270
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3893
01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:41.590
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't fuck your gut bacteria up.</v>

3894
01:38:41.610 --> 01:38:42.780
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't ruin your body,</v>

3895
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:45.030
<v Speaker 4>doesn't get you high.</v>

3896
01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:46.050
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't do anything bad.</v>

3897
01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:47.760
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda goes off about Ibuprofen.</v>

3898
01:38:47.761 --> 01:38:49.500
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't she run a Patrick say,</v>

3899
01:38:49.630 --> 01:38:50.160
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3900
01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:52.500
<v Speaker 4>she was telling me how bad it is for your gut bacteria.</v>

3901
01:38:52.590 --> 01:38:53.400
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>

3902
01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.030
<v Speaker 4>Gut Bacteria.</v>

3903
01:38:54.030 --> 01:38:55.340
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's one of the most important,</v>

3904
01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:58.830
<v Speaker 4>obviously one of most important things that people just don't really know about.</v>

3905
01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:01.050
<v Speaker 4>I think if I can tell,</v>

3906
01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:01.801
<v Speaker 4>if I take,</v>

3907
01:39:01.801 --> 01:39:03.060
<v Speaker 4>if I have enough probiotics for the day,</v>

3908
01:39:03.061 --> 01:39:04.300
<v Speaker 4>I can tell I got to hold.</v>

3909
01:39:04.301 --> 01:39:05.940
<v Speaker 4>It feels way better than if I don't.</v>

3910
01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:06.641
<v Speaker 4>I Love Camp Bucci.</v>

3911
01:39:06.641 --> 01:39:07.474
<v Speaker 4>You'll love it.</v>

3912
01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:08.633
<v Speaker 4>Drink it every day.</v>

3913
01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:10.350
<v Speaker 4>So try that.</v>

3914
01:39:10.351 --> 01:39:11.310
<v Speaker 4>New Watermelon flavor.</v>

3915
01:39:11.311 --> 01:39:12.240
<v Speaker 4>The gts kind?</v>

3916
01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:12.811
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3917
01:39:12.811 --> 01:39:17.811
<v Speaker 4>I only mostly have either the really green one or the gingerade or the original.</v>

3918
01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:18.810
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3919
01:39:18.810 --> 01:39:22.470
<v Speaker 4>those are the original trilogy is good too.</v>

3920
01:39:22.471 --> 01:39:23.304
<v Speaker 4>I liked that one too.</v>

3921
01:39:23.610 --> 01:39:24.690
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes like the grapes,</v>

3922
01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:25.610
<v Speaker 4>the grapes had a lot,</v>

3923
01:39:25.611 --> 01:39:26.880
<v Speaker 4>a little bit too much sugar in it,</v>

3924
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:27.391
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

3925
01:39:27.391 --> 01:39:27.890
<v Speaker 4>Oh does it?</v>

3926
01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:30.240
<v Speaker 4>It's sweet if you look at how much sugar is in there,</v>

3927
01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.770
<v Speaker 4>but still super,</v>

3928
01:39:31.771 --> 01:39:34.060
<v Speaker 4>super good for your body probiotics there.</v>

3929
01:39:34.290 --> 01:39:39.290
<v Speaker 4>So my friend Cameron Hanes is an ultra marathon runner and he was heavily hooked</v>

3930
01:39:39.451 --> 01:39:40.290
<v Speaker 4>on Ibuprofen.</v>

3931
01:39:40.291 --> 01:39:42.000
<v Speaker 4>He was taking 800 milligrams a day,</v>

3932
01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:44.070
<v Speaker 4>sometimes more than once a day.</v>

3933
01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:45.600
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

3934
01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:50.400
<v Speaker 4>I did the podcast with Rhonda and Doctor Rhonda Patrick was going over all the</v>

3935
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:54.690
<v Speaker 4>dangers of nonsteroidal antiinflammatories and Ibuprofen and talking about the</v>

3936
01:39:54.691 --> 01:39:56.550
<v Speaker 4>increased risk of strokes and all these different things.</v>

3937
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:57.420
<v Speaker 4>And I called him up.</v>

3938
01:39:57.421 --> 01:39:57.601
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

3939
01:39:57.601 --> 01:39:57.931
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

3940
01:39:57.931 --> 01:39:59.940
<v Speaker 4>you got to get off that shit right now.</v>

3941
01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:00.541
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

3942
01:40:00.541 --> 01:40:01.710
<v Speaker 4>that stuff's terrible for you.</v>

3943
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:03.450
<v Speaker 4>So here's where it gets crazy.</v>

3944
01:40:03.451 --> 01:40:07.110
<v Speaker 4>He gets off of it and all of his pain goes away.</v>

3945
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:11.280
<v Speaker 4>So the reason why he was taking it was because he was in pain.</v>

3946
01:40:11.310 --> 01:40:12.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm good shit.</v>

3947
01:40:12.271 --> 01:40:12.810
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>

3948
01:40:12.810 --> 01:40:13.350
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3949
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.690
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3950
01:40:13.690 --> 01:40:15.990
<v Speaker 4>for him at least his,</v>

3951
01:40:15.991 --> 01:40:19.320
<v Speaker 4>the inflammation that it was causing him probably because he's taking too much</v>

3952
01:40:19.321 --> 01:40:20.070
<v Speaker 4>as well.</v>

3953
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:20.251
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3954
01:40:20.251 --> 01:40:21.180
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people think like,</v>

3955
01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:21.421
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

3956
01:40:21.421 --> 01:40:22.290
<v Speaker 4>it says take two,</v>

3957
01:40:22.291 --> 01:40:23.124
<v Speaker 4>I'll take sick.</v>

3958
01:40:23.850 --> 01:40:24.450
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3959
01:40:24.450 --> 01:40:25.470
<v Speaker 4>And when you do that,</v>

3960
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:27.990
<v Speaker 4>you're torching your fucking gut bacteria.</v>

3961
01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:31.950
<v Speaker 4>So he's creating all this internal inflammation which is in turn leading to all</v>

3962
01:40:31.951 --> 01:40:35.040
<v Speaker 4>this pain which has in turn making want to take Ibuprofen.</v>

3963
01:40:35.530 --> 01:40:36.210

3976
01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:15.970
<v Speaker 5>I would not pump for the flight.</v>

3977
01:41:15.971 --> 01:41:16.090
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>

3978
01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:18.850
<v Speaker 5>I've never been on a long flight and I was not plump for that and I was pumped</v>

3979
01:41:18.851 --> 01:41:20.320
<v Speaker 5>to go and check it out and they've been out of the country.</v>

3980
01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:21.820
<v Speaker 5>But here's a weird one with that.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3985
01:41:27.370 --> 01:41:31.390
<v Speaker 5>the article says that there's a lot of Singaporeans that try to take drug trips</v>

3986
01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:35.620
<v Speaker 5>and they get caught when they come back cause it's still in their system for</v>

01:41:47.240 --> 01:41:48.370
<v Speaker 5>That's what we're dealing with.</v>

3997
01:41:48.371 --> 01:41:50.170
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is human beings.</v>

01:41:55.691 --> 01:41:56.680
<v Speaker 5>you're a grown adult,</v>

4000
01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:57.910
<v Speaker 5>just like you could buy a drink,</v>

4001
01:41:57.911 --> 01:41:58.720
<v Speaker 5>you could buy a joint,</v>

01:41:58.720 --> 01:41:59.560
<v Speaker 5>which it should be.</v>

4003
01:41:59.561 --> 01:42:00.730
<v Speaker 5>It should have been a long time ago.</v>

4004
01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:04.360
<v Speaker 5>And then there's places where they just put you in a cage.</v>

4005
01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:05.793

01:42:06.481 --> 01:42:08.490
<v Speaker 5>That shit is insane about,</v>

4009
01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:09.970
<v Speaker 5>cause they can't do they even,</v>

4010
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.380
<v Speaker 5>they don't even have like smartphones dressed stuff.</v>

4011
01:42:11.381 --> 01:42:11.531
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

4012
01:42:11.531 --> 01:42:13.600
<v Speaker 5>They don't have internet or don't know what they have.</v>

4013
01:42:13.601 --> 01:42:18.601
<v Speaker 5>I think it should have some sort of a small internet that only uses like North</v>

4014
01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:19.930
<v Speaker 5>Korea channels and shit like that.</v>

4015
01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:21.940
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they get the regular internet.</v>

4016
01:42:24.130 --> 01:42:24.491
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4017
01:42:24.491 --> 01:42:24.761
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

4018
01:42:24.761 --> 01:42:27.100
<v Speaker 5>they're living today under the grip of a dictator.</v>

4019
01:42:27.130 --> 01:42:29.830
<v Speaker 5>It's so easy for us to bitch about random stuff being here,</v>

4020
01:42:29.831 --> 01:42:30.970
<v Speaker 5>but we're so lucky.</v>

4021
01:42:31.180 --> 01:42:31.640
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4022
01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:36.160
<v Speaker 5>Well how about the fact that the Korean guy runs it is friends with Dennis</v>

4023
01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:36.190
<v Speaker 5>Rodman?</v>

4024
01:42:36.190 --> 01:42:36.461
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

4025
01:42:36.461 --> 01:42:37.270
<v Speaker 5>I was.</v>

4026
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:39.160
<v Speaker 5>I was talking to my little brother on about that the other day.</v>

4027
01:42:39.161 --> 01:42:41.170
<v Speaker 5>I was like really serious man.</v>

4028
01:42:41.171 --> 01:42:42.370
<v Speaker 5>He's friends with Dennis Rodman.</v>

4029
01:42:42.371 --> 01:42:43.510
<v Speaker 5>Like what the hell?</v>

4030
01:42:43.570 --> 01:42:47.560
<v Speaker 5>How fucking Dennis Dennis texted real quick to see if he texted back.</v>

4031
01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:49.510
<v Speaker 5>That is fucking crazy.</v>

4032
01:42:49.550 --> 01:42:51.610
<v Speaker 5>That is fucking dentist's parties with that dude.</v>

4033
01:42:52.410 --> 01:42:53.290
<v Speaker 5>Barney's like,</v>

4034
01:42:53.291 --> 01:42:54.430
<v Speaker 5>have you been to North Korea?</v>

4035
01:42:54.490 --> 01:42:55.323
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

4036
01:42:55.450 --> 01:42:56.740
<v Speaker 5>I think more than once.</v>

4037
01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:57.910
<v Speaker 5>Is that,</v>

4038
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:58.600
<v Speaker 5>do they make,</v>

4039
01:42:58.600 --> 01:42:59.231
<v Speaker 5>what was that movie?</v>

4040
01:42:59.231 --> 01:43:03.190
<v Speaker 5>They make fun of North Korea dinner with Dennis Rodman in that too.</v>

4041
01:43:03.191 --> 01:43:03.900
<v Speaker 5>Or No.</v>

4042
01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:04.733
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4043
01:43:04.930 --> 01:43:05.660
<v Speaker 5>that move money.</v>

4044
01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:07.210
<v Speaker 5>It seems like a big risk.</v>

4045
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.421
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4046
01:43:07.421 --> 01:43:07.721
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

4047
01:43:07.721 --> 01:43:08.710
<v Speaker 5>I was thinking that too.</v>

4048
01:43:08.890 --> 01:43:09.011
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4049
01:43:09.011 --> 01:43:10.540
<v Speaker 5>we probably shouldn't talk about that movie.</v>

4050
01:43:12.190 --> 01:43:14.290
<v Speaker 5>Aren't they all have in a meeting here soon?</v>

4051
01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:17.680
<v Speaker 5>Donald and the Korean leaders to meet in Singapore?</v>

4052
01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:18.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4053
01:43:18.210 --> 01:43:20.110
<v Speaker 5>That's what people were talking about.</v>

4054
01:43:20.170 --> 01:43:22.450
<v Speaker 5>The how dangerous it was to me.</v>

4055
01:43:22.460 --> 01:43:23.120
<v Speaker 5>To Singapore.</v>

4056
01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:23.340
<v Speaker 5>Dennis.</v>

4057
01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:23.551
<v Speaker 5>Rob,</v>

4058
01:43:23.551 --> 01:43:23.760
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

4059
01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:27.280
<v Speaker 5>Be in Singapore during Trump king summit sugar.</v>

4060
01:43:27.281 --> 01:43:28.150
<v Speaker 5>We got to get it on that.</v>

4061
01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:31.180
<v Speaker 5>Most of the are going to Singapore.</v>

4062
01:43:31.390 --> 01:43:34.240
<v Speaker 5>See there's some people that were saying they shouldn't do it in Singapore</v>

4063
01:43:34.241 --> 01:43:37.180
<v Speaker 5>because Singapore is such a horrible human rights record,</v>

4064
01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:39.850
<v Speaker 5>so some shit could be going down.</v>

4065
01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:40.001
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4066
01:43:40.001 --> 01:43:44.100
<v Speaker 5>I don't see if Singapore really does lock you up like that just for pot like</v>

4067
01:43:44.101 --> 01:43:44.934
<v Speaker 5>that is.</v>

4068
01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:47.320
<v Speaker 5>That is something that you want to have a meeting with like,</v>

4069
01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:49.120
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't make any sense.</v>

4070
01:43:49.121 --> 01:43:51.410
<v Speaker 5>Like that's an illogical at the government.</v>

4071
01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 5>These</v>

4072
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.760
<v Speaker 4>people running under the grip of their,</v>

4073
01:43:54.761 --> 01:43:56.960
<v Speaker 4>they're living there.</v>

4074
01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:58.730
<v Speaker 4>There's less afraid of lies.</v>

4075
01:43:59.120 --> 01:43:59.451
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4076
01:43:59.451 --> 01:43:59.900
<v Speaker 4>Like there are,</v>

4077
01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:01.490
<v Speaker 4>what are they afraid of with this marijuana?</v>

4078
01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:03.350
<v Speaker 4>What do they think it's going to do?</v>

4079
01:44:03.351 --> 01:44:03.621
<v Speaker 4>What do you,</v>

4080
01:44:03.621 --> 01:44:03.951
<v Speaker 4>what do they,</v>

4081
01:44:03.951 --> 01:44:04.731
<v Speaker 4>what are they afraid of?</v>

4082
01:44:04.731 --> 01:44:08.330
<v Speaker 4>What people taking drugs open people's mind like a little bit fact that they</v>

4083
01:44:08.331 --> 01:44:08.931
<v Speaker 4>think did they,</v>

4084
01:44:08.931 --> 01:44:13.490
<v Speaker 4>and they've made it so that they can just lock you up in a cage if you do</v>

4085
01:44:13.491 --> 01:44:16.100
<v Speaker 4>something with your body that they don't want you to do.</v>

4086
01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:17.153
<v Speaker 4>Look at him while,</v>

4087
01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:21.890
<v Speaker 4>because they've decided that this is some sort of a bizarre form of dictatorship</v>

4088
01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:23.090
<v Speaker 4>that they can get away with.</v>

4089
01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:24.621
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>

4090
01:44:24.621 --> 01:44:25.401
<v Speaker 4>Fuck man.</v>

4091
01:44:25.401 --> 01:44:29.780
<v Speaker 4>That is nuts that that's happening while we're living here this way.</v>

4092
01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:31.580
<v Speaker 4>Trump,</v>

4093
01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:35.090
<v Speaker 4>Kim Singapore summit venue is set.</v>

4094
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:37.400
<v Speaker 4>Trump who had a mommy,</v>

4095
01:44:37.401 --> 01:44:38.234
<v Speaker 4>the president,</v>

4096
01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:42.740
<v Speaker 4>who would want to be the president when you're already a billionaire to imagine</v>

4097
01:44:42.741 --> 01:44:45.290
<v Speaker 4>the sit in on that fuck my life.</v>

4098
01:44:45.550 --> 01:44:46.120
<v Speaker 4>Didn't know.</v>

4099
01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:50.690
<v Speaker 4>The crazy thing is this dude has always been this way and everybody's shocked</v>

4100
01:44:50.691 --> 01:44:52.760
<v Speaker 4>that he's this way now that he's the president.</v>

4101
01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:53.613
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4102
01:44:53.900 --> 01:44:55.670
<v Speaker 4>And it's not just that they're shocked.</v>

4103
01:44:55.671 --> 01:44:56.151
<v Speaker 4>It's just like,</v>

4104
01:44:56.151 --> 01:44:57.080
<v Speaker 4>it is shocking.</v>

4105
01:44:57.970 --> 01:44:59.630
<v Speaker 4>Like this Philadelphia Eagles thing,</v>

4106
01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:02.340
<v Speaker 4>like not enough of them wanted to come to the White House.</v>

4107
01:45:02.341 --> 01:45:03.440
<v Speaker 4>So he canceled the meeting.</v>

4108
01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:04.363
<v Speaker 4>And so the thing,</v>

4109
01:45:04.940 --> 01:45:06.650
<v Speaker 4>they didn't kneel for the national anthem.</v>

4110
01:45:07.130 --> 01:45:09.170
<v Speaker 4>And so then if they find out that no,</v>

4111
01:45:09.171 --> 01:45:10.040
<v Speaker 4>those fucking guys,</v>

4112
01:45:10.041 --> 01:45:10.730
<v Speaker 4>none of them,</v>

4113
01:45:10.730 --> 01:45:12.260
<v Speaker 4>none of them kneeled for the national anthem,</v>

4114
01:45:12.261 --> 01:45:13.094
<v Speaker 4>they all stood.</v>

4115
01:45:14.690 --> 01:45:15.441
<v Speaker 4>So he wrote,</v>

4116
01:45:15.441 --> 01:45:18.040
<v Speaker 4>he's trumps had something along the lines of I fucked it up.</v>

4117
01:45:18.090 --> 01:45:20.690
<v Speaker 4>He said something along the lines of that they didn't,</v>

4118
01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:23.090
<v Speaker 4>some of them didn't stand for the national anthem,</v>

4119
01:45:23.091 --> 01:45:25.070
<v Speaker 4>but it turns out was only one guy that kneeled.</v>

4120
01:45:25.071 --> 01:45:27.830
<v Speaker 4>And the one guy that Neil was cut before,</v>

4121
01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:28.271
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4122
01:45:28.271 --> 01:45:29.450
<v Speaker 4>the regular season.</v>

4123
01:45:29.630 --> 01:45:31.250
<v Speaker 4>So during the regular season,</v>

4124
01:45:31.251 --> 01:45:32.780
<v Speaker 4>everybody was standing for the national anthem.</v>

4125
01:45:32.781 --> 01:45:33.471
<v Speaker 4>So he said something,</v>

4126
01:45:33.471 --> 01:45:34.400
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't even true.</v>

4127
01:45:34.970 --> 01:45:37.190
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't want a small crowd of dudes.</v>

4128
01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:39.960
<v Speaker 4>He didn't want like three dudes elec second stringers,</v>

4129
01:45:40.330 --> 01:45:41.163
<v Speaker 4>dawn old.</v>

4130
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:42.703
<v Speaker 4>Looking forward,</v>

4131
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:46.850
<v Speaker 4>you can tell her all high cause they're melded all dry now.</v>

4132
01:45:46.851 --> 01:45:47.684
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4133
01:45:48.170 --> 01:45:49.580
<v Speaker 4>So I'm the Philly,</v>

4134
01:45:49.670 --> 01:45:51.230
<v Speaker 4>the mayor of Philadelphia,</v>

4135
01:45:51.231 --> 01:45:53.240
<v Speaker 4>or is the governor of Pennsylvania,</v>

4136
01:45:53.241 --> 01:45:53.811
<v Speaker 4>which one was,</v>

4137
01:45:53.811 --> 01:45:55.130
<v Speaker 4>it was the mayor of Philadelphia.</v>

4138
01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:59.540
<v Speaker 4>Somebody went after him and he said what a fragile ego he has that he couldn't</v>

4139
01:45:59.541 --> 01:46:01.010
<v Speaker 4>deal with not having a party.</v>

4140
01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:04.340
<v Speaker 4>We're enough Pete having a party that people didn't want to go to.</v>

4141
01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:06.800
<v Speaker 4>It's just that that's,</v>

4142
01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.980
<v Speaker 4>that kind of shit is like part of him.</v>

4143
01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:10.940
<v Speaker 4>The show man,</v>

4144
01:46:10.970 --> 01:46:13.160
<v Speaker 4>like that's the act that Trump the show man.</v>

4145
01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:15.200
<v Speaker 4>He's been involved in his whole life.</v>

4146
01:46:15.201 --> 01:46:15.471
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4147
01:46:15.471 --> 01:46:19.730
<v Speaker 4>It's like everything he does is the best and pumping everything up and we expect</v>

4148
01:46:19.731 --> 01:46:22.790
<v Speaker 4>differently now that he's the president and that's where it's,</v>

4149
01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:25.100
<v Speaker 4>it's also strange because this is just kind of,</v>

4150
01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:28.490
<v Speaker 4>people were really angry at it because he's doing it as the president,</v>

4151
01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:30.620
<v Speaker 4>but this is like what he's always done.</v>

4152
01:46:30.620 --> 01:46:32.390
<v Speaker 4>He's like a branding genius.</v>

4153
01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:33.530
<v Speaker 4>Any,</v>

4154
01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:36.680
<v Speaker 4>it's weird because we're seeing it as a president or likethis.</v>

4155
01:46:36.681 --> 01:46:37.820
<v Speaker 4>Is that what you're supposed to do?</v>

4156
01:46:37.821 --> 01:46:40.190
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to like bend the truth as the president,</v>

4157
01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:42.770
<v Speaker 4>but like that bending of the truth in his,</v>

4158
01:46:42.771 --> 01:46:44.660
<v Speaker 4>in his eyes is always how he lived.</v>

4159
01:46:44.661 --> 01:46:45.980
<v Speaker 4>He was the Trump guy.</v>

4160
01:46:45.981 --> 01:46:48.320
<v Speaker 4>He's the fucking guy who ran the apprentice.</v>

4161
01:46:48.520 --> 01:46:49.930
<v Speaker 4>Now he runs the country.</v>

4162
01:46:49.931 --> 01:46:50.520
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>

4163
01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:53.760
<v Speaker 4>Fucking never followed politics ever and I had no idea about,</v>

4164
01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:56.850
<v Speaker 4>I bet Paul P in any way thought it was going to be like this.</v>

4165
01:46:56.851 --> 01:46:58.050
<v Speaker 4>Who had never signed up for it.</v>

4166
01:46:58.500 --> 01:46:59.280
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think.</v>

4167
01:46:59.280 --> 01:46:59.730
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4168
01:46:59.730 --> 01:47:00.241
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4169
01:47:00.241 --> 01:47:00.691
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4170
01:47:00.691 --> 01:47:01.530
<v Speaker 4>Not going the way you think.</v>

4171
01:47:01.531 --> 01:47:03.180
<v Speaker 4>Don't you think he would bitch about it though?</v>

4172
01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:04.890
<v Speaker 4>Like bitch about it.</v>

4173
01:47:04.891 --> 01:47:06.180
<v Speaker 4>But that's part of his thing,</v>

4174
01:47:06.181 --> 01:47:06.900
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4175
01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:10.800
<v Speaker 4>The crazy thing is there was no one on the republican side that was,</v>

4176
01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:13.200
<v Speaker 4>that was capable of challenging him.</v>

4177
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:14.580
<v Speaker 4>That's the problem.</v>

4178
01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:16.960
<v Speaker 4>The problem was that they didn't have anybody.</v>

4179
01:47:16.990 --> 01:47:19.860
<v Speaker 4>So there's all of a sudden this guy's in there and I was in there.</v>

4180
01:47:19.861 --> 01:47:22.440
<v Speaker 4>He's probably thinking he's going to lose and then you know,</v>

4181
01:47:22.441 --> 01:47:23.101
<v Speaker 4>he likes to win.</v>

4182
01:47:23.101 --> 01:47:23.910
<v Speaker 4>It's shit.</v>

4183
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:24.301
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

4184
01:47:24.301 --> 01:47:24.511
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

4185
01:47:24.511 --> 01:47:24.691
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4186
01:47:24.691 --> 01:47:25.051
<v Speaker 4>fuck it.</v>

4187
01:47:25.051 --> 01:47:26.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to be president.</v>

4188
01:47:26.250 --> 01:47:27.180
<v Speaker 4>And the next thing you know,</v>

4189
01:47:27.181 --> 01:47:28.140
<v Speaker 4>he is the president.</v>

4190
01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.060
<v Speaker 4>Nobody still the same guy,</v>

4191
01:47:30.061 --> 01:47:30.331
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4192
01:47:30.331 --> 01:47:31.800
<v Speaker 4>He's still the guy from the apprentice.</v>

4193
01:47:32.370 --> 01:47:33.900
<v Speaker 4>That's not his fault.</v>

4194
01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:36.180
<v Speaker 4>It's who he is.</v>

4195
01:47:36.630 --> 01:47:38.400
<v Speaker 4>To ask a guy to change that much.</v>

4196
01:47:38.401 --> 01:47:39.660
<v Speaker 4>It's 70 it's crazy.</v>

4197
01:47:39.661 --> 01:47:44.661
<v Speaker 4>I think the best thing about it is it highlights how ridiculous this whole</v>

4198
01:47:45.361 --> 01:47:50.361
<v Speaker 4>process is and the idea of having one person run 300 million people,</v>

4199
01:47:51.481 --> 01:47:52.770
<v Speaker 4>that's insane.</v>

4200
01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:54.180
<v Speaker 4>And you pick that person,</v>

4201
01:47:54.200 --> 01:47:54.700
<v Speaker 4>it's insane.</v>

4202
01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:56.100
<v Speaker 4>And we don't even know what we're doing.</v>

4203
01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:57.150
<v Speaker 4>Are we even picking?</v>

4204
01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:57.840
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4205
01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:57.991
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4206
01:47:57.991 --> 01:47:58.980
<v Speaker 4>we don't even know what we're doing.</v>

4207
01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:03.210
<v Speaker 4>How much of what we pay and how much of like what the bills are about and all</v>

4208
01:48:03.211 --> 01:48:03.871
<v Speaker 4>these amendments.</v>

4209
01:48:03.871 --> 01:48:04.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm I,</v>

4210
01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:07.920
<v Speaker 4>how much of any of that shit do you pay attention to when Congress is in session</v>

4211
01:48:07.921 --> 01:48:09.150
<v Speaker 4>at the Senate rules on things,</v>

4212
01:48:09.151 --> 01:48:10.560
<v Speaker 4>how much do we pay attention?</v>

4213
01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:12.000
<v Speaker 4>How much does everybody pay attention?</v>

4214
01:48:12.180 --> 01:48:15.930
<v Speaker 4>How much do you even know what someone's actual real policies are?</v>

4215
01:48:15.931 --> 01:48:17.310
<v Speaker 4>At least their stated policies.</v>

4216
01:48:17.311 --> 01:48:18.180
<v Speaker 4>When you're voting for him,</v>

4217
01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:20.070
<v Speaker 4>what is it like 10% people?</v>

4218
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:21.143
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>

4219
01:48:21.540 --> 01:48:21.751
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4220
01:48:21.751 --> 01:48:23.970
<v Speaker 4>like you hear who you're supposed to vote for know,</v>

4221
01:48:23.971 --> 01:48:26.970
<v Speaker 4>vote for Hillary Clinton is Donald Trump's a bad person,</v>

4222
01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:27.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4223
01:48:27.870 --> 01:48:29.100
<v Speaker 4>vote for Hillary Clinton.</v>

4224
01:48:29.130 --> 01:48:30.710
<v Speaker 4>She's the most qualified for the job.</v>

4225
01:48:30.730 --> 01:48:30.961
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

4226
01:48:30.961 --> 01:48:31.261
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4227
01:48:31.261 --> 01:48:31.531
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4228
01:48:31.531 --> 01:48:32.364
<v Speaker 4>that sounds about right.</v>

4229
01:48:32.660 --> 01:48:33.031
<v Speaker 4>And people are like,</v>

4230
01:48:33.031 --> 01:48:34.440
<v Speaker 4>you are voting for Hillary Clinton,</v>

4231
01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:34.921
<v Speaker 4>aren't you?</v>

4232
01:48:34.921 --> 01:48:36.390
<v Speaker 4>She's the most qualified for the job.</v>

4233
01:48:36.391 --> 01:48:36.601
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

4234
01:48:36.601 --> 01:48:37.021
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

4235
01:48:37.021 --> 01:48:37.854
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4236
01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:38.990
<v Speaker 4>I want to be a good person.</v>

4237
01:48:39.100 --> 01:48:40.290
<v Speaker 4>Some of the vote for Hillary.</v>

4238
01:48:40.410 --> 01:48:41.400
<v Speaker 4>What about Jill Stein?</v>

4239
01:48:41.401 --> 01:48:42.750
<v Speaker 4>You know Jill Stein's a woman to,</v>

4240
01:48:42.751 --> 01:48:43.950
<v Speaker 4>you know Jill Stein is brilliant.</v>

4241
01:48:43.951 --> 01:48:45.720
<v Speaker 4>You know Joel Stein's Okay Shit,</v>

4242
01:48:45.870 --> 01:48:46.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go progressive,</v>

4243
01:48:46.741 --> 01:48:47.231
<v Speaker 4>but her stand,</v>

4244
01:48:47.231 --> 01:48:48.064
<v Speaker 4>I told Jill Stein</v>

4245
01:48:50.100 --> 01:48:53.430
<v Speaker 4>and then there was Elizabeth Warren might've lied about being part of American</v>

4246
01:48:53.431 --> 01:48:54.030
<v Speaker 4>Indian.</v>

4247
01:48:54.030 --> 01:48:54.863
<v Speaker 4>That was a problem.</v>

4248
01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:55.930
<v Speaker 4>So it was like,</v>

4249
01:48:55.930 --> 01:49:00.900
<v Speaker 4>like who who's going to go is Bernie Sanders and then all that shit to him and</v>

4250
01:49:00.901 --> 01:49:03.810
<v Speaker 4>Hillary Clinton is that the whole story is so bizarre.</v>

4251
01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:05.460
<v Speaker 4>Like watching it all play out on TV.</v>

4252
01:49:05.461 --> 01:49:06.510
<v Speaker 4>It's so strange.</v>

4253
01:49:06.930 --> 01:49:08.230
<v Speaker 4>It's so strange that this is our,</v>

4254
01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:11.640
<v Speaker 4>our form of government like you would think with,</v>

4255
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:12.810
<v Speaker 4>this is my thought.</v>

4256
01:49:13.110 --> 01:49:17.190
<v Speaker 4>You would think with the kind of things that the organism,</v>

4257
01:49:17.191 --> 01:49:18.060
<v Speaker 4>that is a human being,</v>

4258
01:49:18.061 --> 01:49:23.061
<v Speaker 4>the kind of thing that could figure out a way to make sound go through a metal</v>

4259
01:49:23.101 --> 01:49:28.101
<v Speaker 4>thing covered in foam goes through wires and in real time hits people in their</v>

4260
01:49:30.451 --> 01:49:31.200
<v Speaker 4>ears.</v>

4261
01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:32.370
<v Speaker 4>If they're streaming,</v>

4262
01:49:32.430 --> 01:49:35.820
<v Speaker 4>they could have headphones on beyond the train right now and they're getting</v>

4263
01:49:35.821 --> 01:49:40.821
<v Speaker 4>this in real time that we can send video through the sky and it can hit</v>

4264
01:49:41.491 --> 01:49:42.330
<v Speaker 4>Australia.</v>

4265
01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:46.560
<v Speaker 4>Your friends can text you pictures back and forth from Africa.</v>

4266
01:49:46.561 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 4>They could be in Africa and</v>

4267
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.431
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

4268
01:49:48.431 --> 01:49:51.160
<v Speaker 6>I just saw a leopard and they send you a fucking photo and you're like,</v>

4269
01:49:51.161 --> 01:49:52.000
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit,</v>

4270
01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:53.800
<v Speaker 6>that's flying through the sky.</v>

4271
01:49:54.190 --> 01:49:59.190
<v Speaker 6>And yet the best way we can figure out who's in control of the nuclear weapons</v>

4272
01:49:59.470 --> 01:50:01.300
<v Speaker 6>is to have a popularity contest.</v>

4273
01:50:02.150 --> 01:50:04.690
<v Speaker 6>No word for crazy.</v>

4274
01:50:04.691 --> 01:50:06.070
<v Speaker 6>Where the craziest thing,</v>

4275
01:50:06.150 --> 01:50:06.421
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

4276
01:50:06.421 --> 01:50:06.940
<v Speaker 6>it's not,</v>

4277
01:50:06.940 --> 01:50:07.540
<v Speaker 6>we're like,</v>

4278
01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:12.190
<v Speaker 6>we're in like this wave of like being evolved and not being involved at the same</v>

4279
01:50:12.191 --> 01:50:12.371
<v Speaker 6>time,</v>

4280
01:50:12.371 --> 01:50:17.371
<v Speaker 6>like technologically spectacularly evolved to the point where we can bend matter</v>

4281
01:50:17.681 --> 01:50:22.681
<v Speaker 6>and create nuclear weapons and fly robots to Mars and take pictures and send it</v>

4282
01:50:22.991 --> 01:50:23.800
<v Speaker 6>back to us.</v>

4283
01:50:23.800 --> 01:50:28.540
<v Speaker 6>Like the shit that we can do is off the charts when it comes to like technology</v>

4284
01:50:28.541 --> 01:50:32.410
<v Speaker 6>and our ability to manipulate the world around us and create giant buildings and</v>

4285
01:50:32.411 --> 01:50:35.350
<v Speaker 6>structures and airplanes and bridges and shit.</v>

4286
01:50:35.650 --> 01:50:36.100
<v Speaker 6>But the,</v>

4287
01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:39.190
<v Speaker 6>the monkey interaction thing is still not very good.</v>

4288
01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:40.690
<v Speaker 6>So we still have war.</v>

4289
01:50:40.810 --> 01:50:45.130
<v Speaker 6>We still have places where we send people over with metal tanks and guns and</v>

4290
01:50:45.131 --> 01:50:48.250
<v Speaker 6>shoot people and protect people from the other people that are shooting people</v>

4291
01:50:48.251 --> 01:50:52.690
<v Speaker 6>and get involved in all these fucking crazy things are physical interactions as</v>

4292
01:50:52.730 --> 01:50:57.190
<v Speaker 6>as organisms are just still in this barbaric stage.</v>

4293
01:50:57.370 --> 01:51:02.140
<v Speaker 6>We're still in this one tribe going after another tribe stage from 20,000 years</v>

4294
01:51:02.141 --> 01:51:02.381
<v Speaker 6>ago,</v>

4295
01:51:02.381 --> 01:51:03.580
<v Speaker 6>30,000 years ago.</v>

4296
01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:05.260
<v Speaker 6>It's like the same programming,</v>

4297
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:09.970
<v Speaker 6>but now this programming can fly jets filled with missiles and shoot them out of</v>

4298
01:51:09.971 --> 01:51:13.480
<v Speaker 6>the sky and sneak up on you underwater in a metal tube,</v>

4299
01:51:13.810 --> 01:51:18.640
<v Speaker 6>a summary and it shoots fucking nuclear with missiles and shit underwater.</v>

4300
01:51:18.970 --> 01:51:19.420
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4301
01:51:19.420 --> 01:51:21.490
<v Speaker 6>we're in the weirdest flux.</v>

4302
01:51:21.491 --> 01:51:26.491
<v Speaker 6>We're in this weird sort of unbalanced period in the evolution of the human</v>

4303
01:51:27.161 --> 01:51:31.150
<v Speaker 6>organism cause we can do so much and then put Donald's in charge,</v>

4304
01:51:31.810 --> 01:51:33.910
<v Speaker 6>man about fucking everything.</v>

4305
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:37.900
<v Speaker 6>We're mad about men who decide they're women who want to use the girls' room.</v>

4306
01:51:38.110 --> 01:51:39.520
<v Speaker 6>We're mad about everything.</v>

4307
01:51:39.521 --> 01:51:39.881
<v Speaker 6>We're about,</v>

4308
01:51:39.881 --> 01:51:41.020
<v Speaker 6>about religion.</v>

4309
01:51:41.021 --> 01:51:44.590
<v Speaker 6>We're mad about rights and gender and everything.</v>

4310
01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:45.341
<v Speaker 6>Everything.</v>

4311
01:51:45.341 --> 01:51:45.791
<v Speaker 6>We're mad,</v>

4312
01:51:45.791 --> 01:51:46.660
<v Speaker 6>everyone's mad.</v>

4313
01:51:46.661 --> 01:51:47.710
<v Speaker 6>Fuck rose have bar.</v>

4314
01:51:47.740 --> 01:51:48.580
<v Speaker 6>Everyone's mad.</v>

4315
01:51:48.910 --> 01:51:50.230
<v Speaker 6>Everyone is so mad.</v>

4316
01:51:50.500 --> 01:51:55.480
<v Speaker 6>And while all this is all this weird personal interaction shit is happening,</v>

4317
01:51:55.630 --> 01:51:57.190
<v Speaker 6>that's distracting the fuck out of us.</v>

4318
01:51:57.191 --> 01:51:59.140
<v Speaker 6>The more it ramps up the,</v>

4319
01:51:59.220 --> 01:51:59.831
<v Speaker 6>the better.</v>

4320
01:51:59.831 --> 01:52:04.831
<v Speaker 6>Ai gets our foot artificial intelligence because it gets just keep working on it</v>

4321
01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:07.030
<v Speaker 6>and keep getting better and better.</v>

4322
01:52:07.031 --> 01:52:11.410
<v Speaker 6>We're going to be in like a full on rock fight when AI goes live,</v>

4323
01:52:11.411 --> 01:52:12.100
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

4324
01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:12.933
<v Speaker 6>it's like we're,</v>

4325
01:52:12.970 --> 01:52:16.270
<v Speaker 6>we're falling into this whole like if this was a trap,</v>

4326
01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:19.450
<v Speaker 6>if I was artificial intelligence and I knew how to be like,</v>

4327
01:52:19.451 --> 01:52:21.010
<v Speaker 6>well as what we'll do,</v>

4328
01:52:21.011 --> 01:52:23.890
<v Speaker 6>we'll just go back in time and set people up and make them make us,</v>

4329
01:52:24.340 --> 01:52:29.340
<v Speaker 6>we'll just plant this idea in their heads and just like an aquatic worm makes a</v>

4330
01:52:29.980 --> 01:52:33.340
<v Speaker 6>caterpillar or one of those grasshoppers rather jump into a pool and drowned</v>

4331
01:52:33.341 --> 01:52:35.380
<v Speaker 6>itself so that it could swim out of its brain.</v>

4332
01:52:35.410 --> 01:52:37.570
<v Speaker 6>You ever seen one of those things happen just like that?</v>

4333
01:52:37.571 --> 01:52:38.860
<v Speaker 6>Ai's doing that with us.</v>

4334
01:52:39.070 --> 01:52:44.070
<v Speaker 6>They give us Shiny Samsung Galaxy note nine look at how big the whole pottery is</v>

4335
01:52:44.920 --> 01:52:47.780
<v Speaker 6>and he takes photos of your face and knows your face.</v>

4336
01:52:47.940 --> 01:52:48.990
<v Speaker 6>You can tell your face.</v>

4337
01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:49.370
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4338
01:52:49.370 --> 01:52:51.470
<v Speaker 6>Face ID and fingerprints.</v>

4339
01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:52.680
<v Speaker 6>And before you know it,</v>

4340
01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:53.871
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>

4341
01:52:53.871 --> 01:52:57.350
<v Speaker 6>we've found the best way to get a signal to talk to people doing that.</v>

4342
01:52:57.680 --> 01:52:58.760
<v Speaker 6>You just stick it in your ass.</v>

4343
01:52:58.850 --> 01:53:00.020
<v Speaker 6>It's a little pellet.</v>

4344
01:53:00.110 --> 01:53:02.510
<v Speaker 6>We're gonna put a little robot Dick in our ass,</v>

4345
01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:03.420
<v Speaker 6>a little pepper.</v>

4346
01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:04.071
<v Speaker 6>The appellate.</v>

4347
01:53:04.071 --> 01:53:05.210
<v Speaker 6>If you could just hold in your ass,</v>

4348
01:53:05.211 --> 01:53:05.781
<v Speaker 6>it's smooth.</v>

4349
01:53:05.781 --> 01:53:06.950
<v Speaker 6>Do you barely know what's in there?</v>

4350
01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:09.000
<v Speaker 6>But it connects with your,</v>

4351
01:53:09.001 --> 01:53:10.070
<v Speaker 6>your ass is open.</v>

4352
01:53:10.071 --> 01:53:12.890
<v Speaker 6>It's not like the rest of your skin and y'all got to keep it in your mouth,</v>

4353
01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:13.400
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4354
01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:13.521
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4355
01:53:13.521 --> 01:53:15.290
<v Speaker 6>to asses the way to go cause it's like open.</v>

4356
01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:15.650
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4357
01:53:15.650 --> 01:53:19.390
<v Speaker 6>it's not like you don't have to go through the dermis and so that just just</v>

4358
01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:22.880
<v Speaker 6>connects with you and you can fucking see augmented reality.</v>

4359
01:53:22.881 --> 01:53:24.260
<v Speaker 6>But the little tiny robot dick,</v>

4360
01:53:24.261 --> 01:53:25.094
<v Speaker 6>it's about that big.</v>

4361
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:26.240
<v Speaker 6>You barely feel it.</v>

4362
01:53:26.241 --> 01:53:27.074
<v Speaker 6>It's like a BB.</v>

4363
01:53:27.250 --> 01:53:28.083
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4364
01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:29.570
<v Speaker 6>that's what's going to happen,</v>

4365
01:53:29.571 --> 01:53:29.960
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

4366
01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:30.590
<v Speaker 6>fucking prior.</v>

4367
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:31.090
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4368
01:53:31.090 --> 01:53:34.880
<v Speaker 6>Do these things are growing now our anti-aging shit too.</v>

4369
01:53:34.881 --> 01:53:36.500
<v Speaker 6>Who knows how crazy that's going to get.</v>

4370
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:38.300
<v Speaker 6>I think what the weirdest thing is,</v>

4371
01:53:38.301 --> 01:53:39.230
<v Speaker 6>not the anti aging.</v>

4372
01:53:39.231 --> 01:53:41.390
<v Speaker 6>I think we're going to run into biological limitations.</v>

4373
01:53:41.391 --> 01:53:43.070
<v Speaker 6>I think the weirdest shit is gene editing.</v>

4374
01:53:44.330 --> 01:53:45.570
<v Speaker 6>Fuck yeah,</v>

4375
01:53:45.670 --> 01:53:46.461
<v Speaker 6>let's just solve this.</v>

4376
01:53:46.461 --> 01:53:48.020
<v Speaker 6>Took a turn for the stoner</v>

4377
01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:51.620
<v Speaker 6>gene editing scares the shit out of me.</v>

4378
01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:54.000
<v Speaker 6>Was that unexplained on the,</v>

4379
01:53:54.001 --> 01:53:55.020
<v Speaker 6>explain that new necklace,</v>

4380
01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:55.731
<v Speaker 6>Netflix show,</v>

4381
01:53:55.731 --> 01:53:56.880
<v Speaker 6>gene editing and how,</v>

4382
01:53:56.881 --> 01:53:57.121
<v Speaker 6>how,</v>

4383
01:53:57.121 --> 01:53:57.830
<v Speaker 6>how did he,</v>

4384
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:59.330
<v Speaker 6>that Shit's going to get wild,</v>

4385
01:53:59.331 --> 01:54:00.164
<v Speaker 6>wild country.</v>

4386
01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.400
<v Speaker 6>I only watched the first episode,</v>

4387
01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:01.791
<v Speaker 6>but I was like,</v>

4388
01:54:01.791 --> 01:54:02.960
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit,</v>

4389
01:54:02.961 --> 01:54:06.300
<v Speaker 6>I see where this is going to follow show baby.</v>

4390
01:54:07.610 --> 01:54:08.570
<v Speaker 6>Fuck everyone.</v>

4391
01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:10.520
<v Speaker 6>The man.</v>

4392
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:12.630
<v Speaker 6>As far as that out,</v>

4393
01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:13.660
<v Speaker 6>and I'm like,</v>

4394
01:54:14.690 --> 01:54:15.530
<v Speaker 6>it takes a turn,</v>

4395
01:54:15.531 --> 01:54:18.320
<v Speaker 6>but I'm sure he still had good intentions.</v>

4396
01:54:18.321 --> 01:54:20.000
<v Speaker 6>I think trying to build the community,</v>

4397
01:54:20.001 --> 01:54:21.200
<v Speaker 6>I'm just passionate and this is,</v>

4398
01:54:21.201 --> 01:54:21.561
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

4399
01:54:21.561 --> 01:54:22.394
<v Speaker 6>this is the thing,</v>

4400
01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:26.780
<v Speaker 6>it's the fucking human interaction part is the part that we can't get right.</v>

4401
01:54:27.110 --> 01:54:28.100
<v Speaker 6>It's real weird.</v>

4402
01:54:28.250 --> 01:54:31.970
<v Speaker 6>If you look at all the different kinds of interactions that we managed to</v>

4403
01:54:31.971 --> 01:54:35.810
<v Speaker 6>successfully navigate and people have obviously have problems in business and</v>

4404
01:54:35.811 --> 01:54:39.080
<v Speaker 6>there's lawsuits in business and there's people that get fired and there's all</v>

4405
01:54:39.081 --> 01:54:40.970
<v Speaker 6>sorts of problems with people doing business.</v>

4406
01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:44.480
<v Speaker 6>But overall they get a lot of things done right?</v>

4407
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:46.250
<v Speaker 6>Like business keeps improving.</v>

4408
01:54:46.251 --> 01:54:47.300
<v Speaker 6>Things keep getting better.</v>

4409
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:50.300
<v Speaker 6>We barely improved with how we treat each other,</v>

4410
01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:52.760
<v Speaker 6>like the way human beings treat each other.</v>

4411
01:54:52.970 --> 01:54:57.410
<v Speaker 6>We barely get better at that and we do react to things better.</v>

4412
01:54:57.830 --> 01:55:00.020
<v Speaker 6>Like if we're mad at someone for doing something,</v>

4413
01:55:00.110 --> 01:55:05.110
<v Speaker 6>that's where we would like more clear with like agregious violations of our</v>

4414
01:55:05.811 --> 01:55:06.291
<v Speaker 6>code.</v>

4415
01:55:06.291 --> 01:55:06.471
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

4416
01:55:06.471 --> 01:55:07.304
<v Speaker 6>Like racism.</v>

4417
01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:08.960
<v Speaker 6>Like this Roseanne thing was a big one,</v>

4418
01:55:08.961 --> 01:55:09.740
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4419
01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:10.341
<v Speaker 6>Everybody was like,</v>

4420
01:55:10.341 --> 01:55:11.420
<v Speaker 6>no fucking way.</v>

4421
01:55:11.421 --> 01:55:12.710
<v Speaker 6>We're not tolerating that.</v>

4422
01:55:12.711 --> 01:55:13.544
<v Speaker 6>Fuck her.</v>

4423
01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.170
<v Speaker 6>And the ABC's like Yo fuck it.</v>

4424
01:55:15.171 --> 01:55:16.160
<v Speaker 6>We're pulling the plug on the show.</v>

4425
01:55:16.161 --> 01:55:16.381
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

4426
01:55:16.381 --> 01:55:17.930
<v Speaker 6>like immediate reactions.</v>

4427
01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:19.480
<v Speaker 6>So it's like what I,</v>

4428
01:55:19.481 --> 01:55:20.400
<v Speaker 6>what I'm co,</v>

4429
01:55:20.510 --> 01:55:21.740
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it was right.</v>

4430
01:55:21.741 --> 01:55:25.820
<v Speaker 6>I think she's got a lot of problems and she's taken a shit load of pills and</v>

4431
01:55:25.821 --> 01:55:28.070
<v Speaker 6>she's all fucked up and I know she's not racist.</v>

4432
01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:29.390
<v Speaker 6>At least she tells me that.</v>

4433
01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:34.190
<v Speaker 6>But what I do know is that racism is horrible and people just don't want to</v>

4434
01:55:34.191 --> 01:55:35.210
<v Speaker 6>tolerate it anymore.</v>

4435
01:55:35.211 --> 01:55:36.350
<v Speaker 6>And that's what the good thing is.</v>

4436
01:55:36.351 --> 01:55:37.101
<v Speaker 6>The good thing is like this,</v>

4437
01:55:37.101 --> 01:55:37.490
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4438
01:55:37.490 --> 01:55:42.490
<v Speaker 6>There's overwhelming response from people that they're not tolerating racism</v>

4439
01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:43.500
<v Speaker 6>anymore.</v>

4440
01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 6>You can't</v>

4441
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:44.880
<v Speaker 4>do that anymore.</v>

4442
01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:46.650
<v Speaker 4>We won't tolerate it.</v>

4443
01:55:47.130 --> 01:55:49.650
<v Speaker 4>And this is fairly new man.</v>

4444
01:55:50.160 --> 01:55:53.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean w with the civil rights marches,</v>

4445
01:55:53.191 --> 01:55:54.600
<v Speaker 4>that was in the 60s right?</v>

4446
01:55:55.110 --> 01:55:58.080
<v Speaker 4>I mean think about what was going on in the 50s and the forties and fed that</v>

4447
01:55:58.081 --> 01:55:58.830
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

4448
01:55:58.830 --> 01:56:02.040
<v Speaker 4>That was not that long ago in terms of like how long there's been people.</v>

4449
01:56:02.430 --> 01:56:05.820
<v Speaker 4>So we're dealing with this radical change in this regard,</v>

4450
01:56:06.330 --> 01:56:10.950
<v Speaker 4>but very little change in like our kindness to each other.</v>

4451
01:56:11.930 --> 01:56:16.920
<v Speaker 4>That's why did start the American mushroom day or not the American,</v>

4452
01:56:16.921 --> 01:56:21.180
<v Speaker 4>the worldwide are you should fear has a holiday that he created called true</v>

4453
01:56:21.181 --> 01:56:22.014
<v Speaker 4>fest.</v>

4454
01:56:22.210 --> 01:56:22.521
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4455
01:56:22.521 --> 01:56:23.790
<v Speaker 4>It's several days are,</v>

4456
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:24.663
<v Speaker 4>doesn't fuck around.</v>

4457
01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:28.770
<v Speaker 4>Got a real job since he was the doorman at the comedy store.</v>

4458
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:30.960
<v Speaker 4>He operates on its own schedule.</v>

4459
01:56:31.470 --> 01:56:31.950
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

4460
01:56:31.950 --> 01:56:36.150
<v Speaker 4>that's what it's going to take for something like that worldwide to change.</v>

4461
01:56:36.151 --> 01:56:39.510
<v Speaker 4>It'll certainly help cause shrimp fest festival certainly out she's room to</v>

4462
01:56:39.511 --> 01:56:40.300
<v Speaker 4>help.</v>

4463
01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:41.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm promoting that,</v>

4464
01:56:42.690 --> 01:56:44.130
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like I'm,</v>

4465
01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:45.810
<v Speaker 4>part of it is because we're scared.</v>

4466
01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:47.460
<v Speaker 4>I legitimately feel like we're scared.</v>

4467
01:56:47.461 --> 01:56:49.710
<v Speaker 4>And I think when someone like Trump is in office,</v>

4468
01:56:49.711 --> 01:56:53.410
<v Speaker 4>we're more scared because we realize how easy it is for,</v>

4469
01:56:53.430 --> 01:56:54.263
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4470
01:56:54.450 --> 01:56:54.871
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4471
01:56:54.871 --> 01:56:57.900
<v Speaker 4>I hate to use a term regular person cause he's definitely not a regular person.</v>

4472
01:56:57.901 --> 01:57:00.930
<v Speaker 4>He's very successful and very famous and everybody knew who he was,</v>

4473
01:57:00.931 --> 01:57:03.120
<v Speaker 4>but regular person turns that we don't,</v>

4474
01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:06.060
<v Speaker 4>that's not how it politician acts like that.</v>

4475
01:57:06.061 --> 01:57:07.980
<v Speaker 4>This is like some crazy show man.</v>

4476
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:11.190
<v Speaker 4>And when a crazy show man becomes the leader of the thing,</v>

4477
01:57:11.191 --> 01:57:12.360
<v Speaker 4>whether or not he's doing good is,</v>

4478
01:57:12.370 --> 01:57:15.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even arguing politically whether he's doing good or bad or the economy's</v>

4479
01:57:15.751 --> 01:57:16.680
<v Speaker 4>up because of him,</v>

4480
01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:17.753
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4481
01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:19.650
<v Speaker 4>But it's just how he behaves.</v>

4482
01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:23.140
<v Speaker 4>It's who he is like that that freaks people out.</v>

4483
01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:26.880
<v Speaker 4>And that makes people more on edge and so they're more angry and they're,</v>

4484
01:57:26.881 --> 01:57:27.091
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

4485
01:57:27.091 --> 01:57:27.350
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

4486
01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:31.020
<v Speaker 4>they're more looking to call people out on things and they're more looking to</v>

4487
01:57:31.021 --> 01:57:32.100
<v Speaker 4>stomp out racism.</v>

4488
01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:32.993
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

4489
01:57:33.450 --> 01:57:36.660
<v Speaker 4>And making other people would think if someone like Sam Harris was a precedent</v>

4490
01:57:36.661 --> 01:57:38.940
<v Speaker 4>or something and he was talking about a national mushroom day,</v>

4491
01:57:38.941 --> 01:57:40.050
<v Speaker 4>are talking about that stuff,</v>

4492
01:57:40.051 --> 01:57:41.580
<v Speaker 4>how bad people would freak out.</v>

4493
01:57:42.120 --> 01:57:42.930
<v Speaker 4>Seriously,</v>

4494
01:57:42.930 --> 01:57:43.830
<v Speaker 4>they would freak.</v>

4495
01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:46.020
<v Speaker 4>Or are they just people that disagree with Sam too?</v>

4496
01:57:46.021 --> 01:57:46.201
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4497
01:57:46.201 --> 01:57:47.400
<v Speaker 4>there's a ton of re very,</v>

4498
01:57:47.401 --> 01:57:49.260
<v Speaker 4>very smart people that disagree with Sam.</v>

4499
01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:50.431
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4500
01:57:50.431 --> 01:57:53.820
<v Speaker 4>and it's really interesting to see those disagreements cause when really high</v>

4501
01:57:53.821 --> 01:57:58.821
<v Speaker 4>level intellects debate each other about things or disagree on things and you</v>

4502
01:57:58.921 --> 01:58:03.921
<v Speaker 4>get to see not just their ideas play out and how their ideas work against the</v>

4503
01:58:05.791 --> 01:58:06.780
<v Speaker 4>other person's ideas.</v>

4504
01:58:06.930 --> 01:58:07.860
<v Speaker 4>You get to see that.</v>

4505
01:58:08.490 --> 01:58:13.490
<v Speaker 4>But you also get to see like thinking and,</v>

4506
01:58:14.181 --> 01:58:14.461
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4507
01:58:14.461 --> 01:58:14.731
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4508
01:58:14.731 --> 01:58:17.760
<v Speaker 4>and communicating at a super high level,</v>

4509
01:58:17.970 --> 01:58:18.241
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4510
01:58:18.241 --> 01:58:22.560
<v Speaker 4>They're intellectuals are trying to outsmart each other so that they're debating</v>

4511
01:58:22.561 --> 01:58:26.610
<v Speaker 4>about the existence of God or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

4512
01:58:26.611 --> 01:58:29.100
<v Speaker 4>When you get really smart people who disagree on Shit.</v>

4513
01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:30.930
<v Speaker 4>Very fascinating.</v>

4514
01:58:31.050 --> 01:58:32.730
<v Speaker 4>It's like one of the more interesting things to watch.</v>

4515
01:58:32.731 --> 01:58:34.410
<v Speaker 4>So like a lot of ways,</v>

4516
01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:35.640
<v Speaker 4>high level Jujitsu,</v>

4517
01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:36.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4518
01:58:36.570 --> 01:58:38.820
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of ways you're watching like Oh,</v>

4519
01:58:38.821 --> 01:58:39.330
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

4520
01:58:39.330 --> 01:58:39.931
<v Speaker 4>And those guys,</v>

4521
01:58:39.931 --> 01:58:42.340
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them get into g like is in a Jujitsu,</v>

4522

4523
01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:43.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4524
01:58:43.330 --> 01:58:45.040
<v Speaker 4>I think that's one of the reasons why he's into it.</v>

4525
01:58:45.041 --> 01:58:46.900
<v Speaker 4>It's cause he's kind of doing Jujitsu when he's,</v>

4526
01:58:46.990 --> 01:58:48.250
<v Speaker 4>when he's doing these debates.</v>

4527
01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:48.870

<v Speaker 4>Super Smart dudes that are really good at Jujitsu.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Scary.</v>

4551
01:59:20.471 --> 01:59:20.740
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

4552
01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:23.080
<v Speaker 4>I think like getting a black belt from someone goods,</v>

4553
01:59:23.081 --> 01:59:26.770
<v Speaker 4>one of the hardest degrees out there to get in any college or anything</v>

4554
01:59:27.770 --> 01:59:28.451
<v Speaker 4>physically.</v>

4555
01:59:28.451 --> 01:59:33.451
<v Speaker 4>The thing about college is if you put in the work and you're smart enough,</v>

4556
01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:34.960
<v Speaker 4>it's possible.</v>

4557
01:59:34.961 --> 01:59:35.141
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4558
01:59:35.141 --> 01:59:35.974
<v Speaker 4>you can do it.</v>

4559
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4560
01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:38.080
<v Speaker 4>it's a possible achievement.</v>

4561
01:59:38.081 --> 01:59:39.400
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people have done it.</v>

4562
01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:41.230
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people do it every year,</v>

4563
01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:45.030
<v Speaker 4>but to really get a black belt bull,</v>

4564
01:59:46.810 --> 01:59:47.260
<v Speaker 4>you gotta get,</v>

4565
01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:48.190
<v Speaker 4>you gotta get better.</v>

4566
01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:49.000
<v Speaker 4>Like you got it.</v>

4567
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:49.721
<v Speaker 4>You have to get back,</v>

4568
01:59:49.721 --> 01:59:50.680
<v Speaker 4>you gotta get strong,</v>

4569
01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:52.330
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get choked a lot.</v>

4570
01:59:52.750 --> 01:59:55.990
<v Speaker 4>And how were you built or you built normal like a small,</v>

4571
01:59:56.250 --> 01:59:56.831
<v Speaker 4>if you're small,</v>

4572
01:59:56.831 --> 01:59:58.090
<v Speaker 4>you're extra super fucked.</v>

4573
01:59:58.300 --> 01:59:58.750
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4574
01:59:58.750 --> 01:59:59.530
<v Speaker 4>How's your ego?</v>

4575
01:59:59.530 --> 01:59:59.681
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4576
01:59:59.681 --> 02:00:00.400
<v Speaker 4>How's your ego?</v>

4577
02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:01.600
<v Speaker 4>Can you learn?</v>

4578
02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:03.280
<v Speaker 4>Do you know how to tap?</v>

4579
02:00:03.310 --> 02:00:04.150
<v Speaker 4>Because if you don't tap,</v>

4580
02:00:04.151 --> 02:00:04.984
<v Speaker 4>you're going to get hurt.</v>

4581
02:00:05.310 --> 02:00:10.120
<v Speaker 4>Like almost every significant injury I ever got doing Jujitsu,</v>

4582
02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:12.730
<v Speaker 4>other than like one fucked up knee was,</v>

4583
02:00:12.731 --> 02:00:15.070
<v Speaker 4>which was just a weird passing the guard thing.</v>

4584
02:00:15.071 --> 02:00:15.260
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

4585
02:00:15.260 --> 02:00:16.330
<v Speaker 4>my ACL popped.</v>

4586
02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:19.030
<v Speaker 4>But almost every other one was from not happening.</v>

4587
02:00:19.210 --> 02:00:20.043
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4588
02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:22.630
<v Speaker 4>just just decide you're not going to tap.</v>

4589
02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:23.800
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try to get out of this.</v>

4590
02:00:23.801 --> 02:00:24.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna try it.</v>

4591
02:00:24.190 --> 02:00:27.030
<v Speaker 4>And someone's got unit Doris or something like that and your shit's all fucking</v>

4592
02:00:27.031 --> 02:00:29.380
<v Speaker 4>cracked over and then for the next week,</v>

4593
02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:30.720
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

4594
02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:33.460
<v Speaker 4>you get that tightness in the middle of your back.</v>

4595
02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:35.020
<v Speaker 4>Like why didn't I just tap?</v>

4596
02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:35.980
<v Speaker 4>I should have just tapped.</v>

4597
02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:37.150
<v Speaker 4>John Crouch always told me,</v>

4598
02:00:37.151 --> 02:00:37.391
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

4599
02:00:37.391 --> 02:00:37.631
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

4600
02:00:37.631 --> 02:00:39.490
<v Speaker 4>you're just so tough when you get submissions.</v>

4601
02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:40.510
<v Speaker 4>People can't tap you out,</v>

4602
02:00:40.511 --> 02:00:42.700
<v Speaker 4>but I want you to just focus on not getting there.</v>

4603
02:00:42.730 --> 02:00:43.331
<v Speaker 4>So when you get there,</v>

4604
02:00:43.331 --> 02:00:44.170
<v Speaker 4>just tap right away.</v>

4605
02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:45.880
<v Speaker 4>Just focus on not getting there.</v>

4606
02:00:45.970 --> 02:00:47.470
<v Speaker 4>It's very smart because you know what,</v>

4607
02:00:47.471 --> 02:00:48.760
<v Speaker 4>you're always going to be tough.</v>

4608
02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:50.470
<v Speaker 4>And there's a certain,</v>

4609
02:00:50.500 --> 02:00:53.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean you need to know a certain amount of high level defense.</v>

4610
02:00:53.051 --> 02:00:53.884
<v Speaker 4>Like how can you,</v>

4611
02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:57.310
<v Speaker 4>how long can you survive in a certain spot if you actually have to survive.</v>

4612
02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:59.140
<v Speaker 4>But in training you're not really surviving.</v>

4613
02:00:59.141 --> 02:00:59.351
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

4614
02:00:59.351 --> 02:00:59.890
<v Speaker 4>You're just,</v>

4615
02:00:59.890 --> 02:01:01.240
<v Speaker 4>you should just tap sometimes.</v>

4616
02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:01.600
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

4617
02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:05.680
<v Speaker 4>Especially with Nishit and arm shit and you know,</v>

4618
02:01:05.681 --> 02:01:08.560
<v Speaker 4>you pop something and then it's fucked for six months.</v>

4619
02:01:09.090 --> 02:01:12.550
<v Speaker 4>That's where we're going to be focused on a lot with Sean is a lot of legs and</v>

4620
02:01:12.551 --> 02:01:14.050
<v Speaker 4>heal hooks and the bars,</v>

4621
02:01:14.530 --> 02:01:18.280
<v Speaker 4>the lower half of the body who you guys are working with that on a Gusto Mendez</v>

4622
02:01:18.281 --> 02:01:19.990
<v Speaker 4>to Keanio yeah.</v>

4623
02:01:20.230 --> 02:01:20.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4624
02:01:20.530 --> 02:01:21.640
<v Speaker 4>super high level.</v>

4625
02:01:21.700 --> 02:01:22.121
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>

4626
02:01:22.121 --> 02:01:22.451
<v Speaker 4>They hit,</v>

4627
02:01:22.451 --> 02:01:23.550
<v Speaker 4>they have competition roles.</v>

4628
02:01:23.630 --> 02:01:25.200
<v Speaker 4>It's like all the black belt,</v>

4629
02:01:25.210 --> 02:01:26.110
<v Speaker 4>like what are the six,</v>

4630
02:01:26.111 --> 02:01:26.920
<v Speaker 4>seven,</v>

4631
02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:27.221
<v Speaker 4>six,</v>

4632
02:01:27.221 --> 02:01:28.870
<v Speaker 4>seven black belts and we do a 10 minute rounds.</v>

4633
02:01:28.871 --> 02:01:30.580
<v Speaker 4>Usually Tim go back.</v>

4634
02:01:30.990 --> 02:01:31.720
<v Speaker 4>It's fun.</v>

4635
02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:36.720
<v Speaker 4>That leg lock game is hitting an extremely high level right now in Jiu Jitsu and</v>

4636
02:01:36.941 --> 02:01:38.620
<v Speaker 4>now trickling into MMA.</v>

4637
02:01:38.621 --> 02:01:40.160
<v Speaker 4>You know Dylan Dannis like</v>

4638
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:43.940
<v Speaker 5>the way he looked in Beltour I think slowly in MMA it's going to be tough</v>

4639
02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:48.830
<v Speaker 5>because a lot of spots you're getting punched and then one punch solid punch in</v>

4640
02:01:48.831 --> 02:01:50.390
<v Speaker 5>the right spot changes their game.</v>

4641
02:01:50.590 --> 02:01:51.960
<v Speaker 5>It puts a little fear in their mind.</v>

4642
02:01:51.961 --> 02:01:53.210
<v Speaker 5>So then for sure,</v>

4643
02:01:53.211 --> 02:01:55.700
<v Speaker 5>but if those guys can you get good enough to strike,</v>

4644
02:01:55.701 --> 02:01:56.481
<v Speaker 5>to become a threat,</v>

4645
02:01:56.481 --> 02:01:57.830
<v Speaker 5>like a guy like Gary Tonin,</v>

4646
02:01:57.860 --> 02:01:58.400
<v Speaker 5>whoo.</v>

4647
02:01:58.400 --> 02:01:59.233
<v Speaker 5>That's scary.</v>

4648
02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:00.500
<v Speaker 5>That's a scary dude.</v>

4649
02:02:00.530 --> 02:02:02.210
<v Speaker 5>It really is very scary man.</v>

4650
02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:03.680
<v Speaker 5>Cause he gets a hold of that leg.</v>

4651
02:02:03.681 --> 02:02:05.710
<v Speaker 5>Urine [inaudible] bowls,</v>

4652
02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:07.580
<v Speaker 5>sons and steps ahead.</v>

4653
02:02:07.581 --> 02:02:08.151
<v Speaker 5>That Donna,</v>

4654
02:02:08.151 --> 02:02:09.250
<v Speaker 5>her death squad man,</v>

4655
02:02:09.260 --> 02:02:09.551
<v Speaker 5>Donna,</v>

<v Speaker 5>a little moons and stars,</v>

4659
02:02:15.321 --> 02:02:19.790
<v Speaker 5>he's a wizard zone who studied philosophy like that and this is a type of person</v>

4660

<v Speaker 5>routine.</v>

4665
02:02:25.340 --> 02:02:26.420
<v Speaker 5>It's really interesting.</v>

02:02:37.970 --> 02:02:40.370
<v Speaker 5>He shot it and he didn't like it all.</v>

4676
02:02:40.371 --> 02:02:41.270
<v Speaker 5>So he reshot it.</v>

4677
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:42.590
<v Speaker 5>This Reshad at him.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4682
02:02:44.661 --> 02:02:45.200
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be,</v>

4683
02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:47.750
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be funny to see how far those leg luck game.</v>

4684
02:02:47.751 --> 02:02:51.020
<v Speaker 5>We'll go and him and maybe before we evolve more and then find the counter to</v>

4685
02:02:51.021 --> 02:02:51.440
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

4686
02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:52.190
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

4687
02:02:52.190 --> 02:02:52.371
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

4688
02:02:52.371 --> 02:02:56.210
<v Speaker 5>what's interesting to me is that this is essentially all out of a conversation</v>

4689
02:02:56.211 --> 02:02:58.760
<v Speaker 5>that he had with Dean lister.</v>

4690
02:02:59.390 --> 02:02:59.811
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4691
02:02:59.811 --> 02:03:01.580
<v Speaker 5>and it's become a meme now.</v>

4692
02:03:01.610 --> 02:03:02.301
<v Speaker 5>It's really funny.</v>

4693
02:03:02.301 --> 02:03:05.960
<v Speaker 5>There's a photo of a girl lying in bed and she's like,</v>

4694
02:03:05.961 --> 02:03:08.590
<v Speaker 5>he's probably thinking about another woman and the guy.</v>

4695
02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:09.493
<v Speaker 5>I said,</v>

4696
02:03:09.790 --> 02:03:10.100
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4697
02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:12.110
<v Speaker 5>why would you ignore 50% of the day?</v>

4698
02:03:12.111 --> 02:03:12.944
<v Speaker 5>We bought it,</v>

4699
02:03:16.660 --> 02:03:18.600
<v Speaker 5>and I love how John Danaher said it too.</v>

4700
02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:20.201
<v Speaker 5>He says,</v>

4701
02:03:20.201 --> 02:03:21.034
<v Speaker 5>why would you,</v>

4702
02:03:21.230 --> 02:03:22.063
<v Speaker 5>why would you,</v>

4703
02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:24.710
<v Speaker 5>why would you ignore 50% of the human body?</v>

4704
02:03:24.711 --> 02:03:25.544
<v Speaker 5>And we're like,</v>

4705
02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:26.713
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

4706
02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:28.490
<v Speaker 5>it makes you uncomfortable around.</v>

4707
02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:29.360
<v Speaker 5>He's super smart.</v>

4708
02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:30.223
<v Speaker 5>That's awesome.</v>

4709
02:03:30.540 --> 02:03:30.860
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

4710
02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:31.693
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

4711
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:33.650
<v Speaker 5>if you're a blue belt and he wrote with a black belt,</v>

4712
02:03:33.651 --> 02:03:34.860
<v Speaker 5>you always feel a little weird around them.</v>

4713
02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:36.141
<v Speaker 5>That's how I feel.</v>

4714
02:03:36.141 --> 02:03:37.160
<v Speaker 5>Random intellectually,</v>

4715
02:03:38.630 --> 02:03:39.920
<v Speaker 5>not just physically,</v>

4716
02:03:39.921 --> 02:03:40.850
<v Speaker 5>but they like,</v>

4717
02:03:40.851 --> 02:03:41.021
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4718
02:03:41.021 --> 02:03:41.750
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

4719
02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:42.890
<v Speaker 5>Can you tell me what it is?</v>

4720
02:03:42.891 --> 02:03:43.641
<v Speaker 5>I'm not arguing with you,</v>

4721
02:03:43.641 --> 02:03:44.190
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4722
02:03:44.190 --> 02:03:44.600
<v Speaker 5>She said,</v>

4723
02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:44.901
<v Speaker 5>John,</v>

4724
02:03:44.901 --> 02:03:45.740
<v Speaker 5>take a puff of this.</v>

4725
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:48.430
<v Speaker 5>Does he get hired on?</v>

4726
02:03:48.650 --> 02:03:49.400
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

4727
02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:49.750
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

4728
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:50.780
<v Speaker 5>Probably doesn't have to.</v>

4729
02:03:51.210 --> 02:03:52.640
<v Speaker 5>Probably can do it to his own brain.</v>

4730
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:54.900
<v Speaker 5>I'll just put myself in a perfect position.</v>

4731
02:03:55.550 --> 02:03:57.980
<v Speaker 5>You wonder if someone like Elon Musk gets high?</v>

4732
02:03:58.670 --> 02:03:59.600
<v Speaker 5>I would hope so.</v>

4733
02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:00.550
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

4734
02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:03.020
<v Speaker 5>Fuck that guy is on another level.</v>

4735
02:04:03.070 --> 02:04:06.630
<v Speaker 5>It's aren't they building those tunnels already under la or they build,</v>

4736
02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:07.130
<v Speaker 5>oh man,</v>

4737
02:04:07.130 --> 02:04:09.830
<v Speaker 5>they got their building that he's got a boring company.</v>

4738
02:04:09.831 --> 02:04:14.120
<v Speaker 5>They're gonna bore holes through La and reinforce them and you're going to go</v>

4739
02:04:14.121 --> 02:04:15.170
<v Speaker 5>through on sleds.</v>

4740
02:04:15.590 --> 02:04:18.410
<v Speaker 5>I think they're all like getting done right now.</v>

4741
02:04:18.530 --> 02:04:18.741
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

4742
02:04:18.741 --> 02:04:22.370
<v Speaker 5>I do not want to be in one of those things and hear the rumble of the earth and</v>

4743
02:04:22.371 --> 02:04:23.300
<v Speaker 5>see the ocean.</v>

4744
02:04:23.301 --> 02:04:24.134
<v Speaker 5>Russia</v>

4745
02:04:27.590 --> 02:04:32.570
<v Speaker 5>as tsunami hits the tsunami hits while you're in one of those pipes.</v>

4746
02:04:33.710 --> 02:04:35.090
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if it got out of that and your butt's</v>

4747
02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:38.790
<v Speaker 5>coming from the middle of the ocean.</v>

4748
02:04:38.791 --> 02:04:39.624
<v Speaker 5>Just</v>

4749
02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:41.673
<v Speaker 5>good.</v>

4750
02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:47.880
<v Speaker 5>Paul's back and thousands of fucking miles of the earth had been torn apart.</v>

4751
02:04:48.810 --> 02:04:50.700
<v Speaker 5>That shit's happened to gang at times.</v>

4752
02:04:51.210 --> 02:04:51.961
<v Speaker 5>Seriously.</v>

4753
02:04:51.961 --> 02:04:52.794
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

4754
02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:57.190
<v Speaker 5>never knew that shit has happened many times where the cowboy,</v>

4755
02:04:57.220 --> 02:04:59.940
<v Speaker 5>what happened in Fukushima has happened a ton of times.</v>

4756
02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:00.930
<v Speaker 5>We're just,</v>

4757
02:05:00.930 --> 02:05:02.010
<v Speaker 5>we don't live long.</v>

4758
02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:03.570
<v Speaker 5>So these things,</v>

4759
02:05:03.571 --> 02:05:05.010
<v Speaker 5>they'd seem like they're forever,</v>

4760
02:05:05.490 --> 02:05:07.440
<v Speaker 5>but it's based on our lifespan.</v>

4761
02:05:07.470 --> 02:05:09.990
<v Speaker 5>Our lifespan is so weird cause it's,</v>

4762
02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:11.250
<v Speaker 5>it's really short.</v>

4763
02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:12.301
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4764
02:05:12.301 --> 02:05:14.670
<v Speaker 5>and it seems like it's not because you're in the middle of it,</v>

4765
02:05:14.700 --> 02:05:16.170
<v Speaker 5>but if you look at it objectively,</v>

4766
02:05:16.490 --> 02:05:17.160
<v Speaker 5>you're not.</v>

4767
02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:21.750
<v Speaker 5>No one makes it out alive and it doesn't take that long for your body to give</v>

4768
02:05:21.751 --> 02:05:22.350
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

4769
02:05:22.350 --> 02:05:25.950
<v Speaker 5>So by the time you start figuring things out and getting your shit together,</v>

4770
02:05:25.951 --> 02:05:29.040
<v Speaker 5>you're already old falling apart.</v>

4771
02:05:29.580 --> 02:05:34.580
<v Speaker 5>And all the while we're dealing with a planet whose time is,</v>

4772
02:05:35.820 --> 02:05:36.840
<v Speaker 5>is almost infinite,</v>

4773
02:05:36.841 --> 02:05:37.171
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

4774
02:05:37.171 --> 02:05:37.571
<v Speaker 5>For in,</v>

4775
02:05:37.571 --> 02:05:39.030
<v Speaker 5>in terms of like what we can understand.</v>

4776
02:05:39.240 --> 02:05:41.400
<v Speaker 5>So all these things that we know have happened,</v>

4777
02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:46.580
<v Speaker 5>even if we study supervolcanoes and tsunamis and cataclysmic earthquakes and</v>

4778
02:05:46.801 --> 02:05:47.581
<v Speaker 5>solar flares,</v>

4779
02:05:47.581 --> 02:05:48.810
<v Speaker 5>even when we study all those things,</v>

4780
02:05:48.811 --> 02:05:49.320
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

4781
02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:50.250
<v Speaker 5>we don't think they're real.</v>

4782
02:05:50.700 --> 02:05:51.101
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

4783
02:05:51.101 --> 02:05:51.381
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4784
02:05:51.381 --> 02:05:51.571
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

4785
02:05:51.571 --> 02:05:51.931
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>

4786
02:05:51.931 --> 02:05:52.141
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4787
02:05:52.141 --> 02:05:52.980
<v Speaker 5>it's Guatemala.</v>

4788
02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:54.540
<v Speaker 5>It's only happened in Guatemala.</v>

4789
02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:54.811
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4790
02:05:54.811 --> 02:05:55.290
<v Speaker 5>it's Hawaii.</v>

4791
02:05:55.290 --> 02:05:55.800
<v Speaker 5>But Hey,</v>

4792
02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:57.030
<v Speaker 5>they knew they're on an island.</v>

4793
02:05:57.630 --> 02:06:02.340
<v Speaker 5>We can't control this thing when he houses because we don't think very good</v>

4794
02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:04.040
<v Speaker 5>because we don't realize that we,</v>

4795
02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:06.390
<v Speaker 5>this might not be here in a year,</v>

4796
02:06:06.391 --> 02:06:10.770
<v Speaker 5>there might come a giant wave that hits those fucking houses are perched.</v>

4797
02:06:11.070 --> 02:06:13.980
<v Speaker 5>And Santa Monica perched over the water and Malibu and shit.</v>

4798
02:06:14.010 --> 02:06:15.480
<v Speaker 5>But what are you doing?</v>

4799
02:06:16.410 --> 02:06:18.840
<v Speaker 5>How are you still confident that water's not going to move?</v>

4800
02:06:18.870 --> 02:06:19.380
<v Speaker 5>Ah,</v>

4801
02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:20.910
<v Speaker 5>cause it hasn't moved in 30 years.</v>

4802
02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:22.080
<v Speaker 5>That's a second.</v>

4803
02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:22.890
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4804
02:06:22.890 --> 02:06:24.990
<v Speaker 5>in the life of the earth.</v>

4805
02:06:25.020 --> 02:06:26.400
<v Speaker 5>30 years is a second.</v>

4806
02:06:26.460 --> 02:06:27.293
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

4807
02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:35.840
<v Speaker 5>You put your house on the edge of an alien world that moves back and forth and</v>

4808
02:06:37.561 --> 02:06:39.450
<v Speaker 5>there's one contractor who made that decision.</v>

4809
02:06:39.930 --> 02:06:40.763
<v Speaker 5>It'll hold up.</v>

4810
02:06:40.770 --> 02:06:42.240
<v Speaker 5>Well these guys just decide,</v>

4811
02:06:42.241 --> 02:06:42.601
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4812
02:06:42.601 --> 02:06:43.090
<v Speaker 5>I want to,</v>

4813
02:06:43.090 --> 02:06:46.530
<v Speaker 5>I want to wake up in the morning cause I'm a winner and I want to do my coffee</v>

4814
02:06:46.650 --> 02:06:49.640
<v Speaker 5>and I want to do my coke and I want to look out the window and see the fucking</v>

02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:53.490
<v Speaker 5>Super amped up.</v>

4818
02:06:53.491 --> 02:06:57.360
<v Speaker 5>Aderall dude's trying to run the world staring at that water.</v>

4819
02:06:57.361 --> 02:06:58.021
<v Speaker 5>It looks great.</v>

4820
02:06:58.021 --> 02:06:58.854
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>

4821
02:06:58.870 --> 02:07:00.000
<v Speaker 5>Can I ask how can I have water?</v>

4822
02:07:00.030 --> 02:07:02.010
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's looking at them like they got it figured out.</v>

4823
02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:04.193
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

4824
02:07:04.290 --> 02:07:04.891
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

4825
02:07:04.891 --> 02:07:07.170
<v Speaker 5>Luxury home teeters on collapsing off cliff.</v>

4826
02:07:07.230 --> 02:07:10.350
<v Speaker 5>So that cliff gave up in the house is still there in Texas actually.</v>

4827

<v Speaker 5>Look at that one right above it.</v>

4832
02:07:15.750 --> 02:07:15.991
<v Speaker 5>Yo.</v>

4833
02:07:15.991 --> 02:07:16.824
<v Speaker 5>You've got to fix that.</v>

4834
02:07:17.130 --> 02:07:18.120
<v Speaker 5>Whoever the contractor is,</v>

4835
02:07:18.121 --> 02:07:18.954
<v Speaker 5>you get into,</v>

4836
02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:20.383

02:07:24.260 --> 02:07:25.093

02:07:25.140 --> 02:07:25.651
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

4841
02:07:25.651 --> 02:07:27.690
<v Speaker 5>that's what Cooper looks fake as fuck.</v>

4842
02:07:27.691 --> 02:07:32.370
<v Speaker 5>Who would trust that fucking shitty idea of a house hanging off the edge of a</v>

4843
02:07:32.371 --> 02:07:33.204
<v Speaker 5>cliff?</v>

4844
02:07:34.070 --> 02:07:34.410
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

4845
02:07:34.410 --> 02:07:35.243
<v Speaker 5>Look at that thing.</v>

4846
02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 5>That's</v>

4847
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:36.610
<v Speaker 4>beautiful.</v>

4848
02:07:36.610 --> 02:07:40.180
<v Speaker 4>Is that real futuristic shit that looks fake her than this one?</v>

4849
02:07:40.181 --> 02:07:41.050
<v Speaker 4>This one might be real.</v>

4850
02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:42.760
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

4851
02:07:43.660 --> 02:07:45.040
<v Speaker 4>He parks his car on top of that.</v>

4852
02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:48.260
<v Speaker 4>What have you heard or know the night here?</v>

4853
02:07:51.410 --> 02:07:51.690
<v Speaker 7>They're like,</v>

4854
02:07:51.690 --> 02:07:52.410
<v Speaker 7>oh my God,</v>

4855
02:07:52.410 --> 02:07:54.450
<v Speaker 7>we gotta get the fuck off the house,</v>

4856
02:07:54.451 --> 02:07:54.721
<v Speaker 7>honey.</v>

4857
02:07:54.721 --> 02:07:55.860
<v Speaker 7>We're drawing down.</v>

4858
02:07:55.950 --> 02:07:56.311
<v Speaker 7>Wait,</v>

4859
02:07:56.311 --> 02:07:56.610
<v Speaker 7>wait.</v>

4860
02:07:56.610 --> 02:07:57.480
<v Speaker 7>I can't find my phone.</v>

4861
02:08:01.290 --> 02:08:02.580
<v Speaker 7>Let Ricky grab his iPad.</v>

4862
02:08:03.900 --> 02:08:04.100
<v Speaker 7>He'll</v>

4863
02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:05.500
<v Speaker 4>look at you running off in the distance,</v>

4864
02:08:05.501 --> 02:08:08.470
<v Speaker 4>holding the baby under your arm and you fucking see the house fall off the side</v>

4865
02:08:08.471 --> 02:08:08.980
<v Speaker 4>of the cliff.</v>

4866
02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:09.930
<v Speaker 4>Polo.</v>

4867
02:08:10.060 --> 02:08:11.450
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

4868
02:08:12.060 --> 02:08:12.890
<v Speaker 4>It is real.</v>

4869
02:08:12.890 --> 02:08:14.140
<v Speaker 4>It's real Australia.</v>

4870
02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:15.310
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

4871
02:08:15.370 --> 02:08:16.203
<v Speaker 4>People are crazy.</v>

4872
02:08:16.230 --> 02:08:16.931
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't smoke.</v>

4873
02:08:16.931 --> 02:08:17.764
<v Speaker 4>I get too paranoid.</v>

4874
02:08:17.890 --> 02:08:19.360
<v Speaker 4>Australians don't give a fuck.</v>

4875
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:20.680
<v Speaker 4>They don't give a fuck.</v>

4876
02:08:20.770 --> 02:08:20.921
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4877
02:08:20.921 --> 02:08:21.800
<v Speaker 4>is that an Australia?</v>

4878
02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:22.210
<v Speaker 4>Those are,</v>

4879
02:08:22.210 --> 02:08:23.600
<v Speaker 4>those are exceptional humans.</v>

4880
02:08:23.890 --> 02:08:24.670
<v Speaker 4>It's sweet.</v>

4881
02:08:24.670 --> 02:08:26.140
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big fan of the Australians.</v>

4882
02:08:26.141 --> 02:08:26.591
<v Speaker 4>Might be fake.</v>

4883
02:08:26.591 --> 02:08:27.370
<v Speaker 4>Might be fake.</v>

4884
02:08:27.370 --> 02:08:27.651
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

4885
02:08:27.651 --> 02:08:28.030
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4886
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:31.930
<v Speaker 4>I found an article that looked like it said it was real and then I just looking</v>

4887
02:08:31.931 --> 02:08:32.960
<v Speaker 4>for more and it says it my,</v>

4888
02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:34.540
<v Speaker 4>like Google said fake after it.</v>

4889
02:08:35.170 --> 02:08:35.530
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4890
02:08:35.530 --> 02:08:35.920
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4891
02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:36.221
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

4892
02:08:36.221 --> 02:08:36.371
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4893
02:08:36.371 --> 02:08:37.204
<v Speaker 4>it's funny,</v>

4894
02:08:37.370 --> 02:08:37.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4895
02:08:37.570 --> 02:08:38.500
<v Speaker 4>switching subjects,</v>

4896
02:08:38.501 --> 02:08:40.810
<v Speaker 4>but like seeing people that are married,</v>

4897
02:08:40.811 --> 02:08:42.220
<v Speaker 4>husbands that are married to their wife,</v>

4898
02:08:42.221 --> 02:08:43.330
<v Speaker 4>just going through the,</v>

4899
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:47.560
<v Speaker 4>the classic role of get married and you got your wife and you don't talk to her</v>

4900
02:08:47.561 --> 02:08:50.170
<v Speaker 4>and go to the boys series explained.</v>

4901
02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:50.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4902
02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:51.753
<v Speaker 4>That's a good one.</v>

4903
02:08:51.790 --> 02:08:52.623
<v Speaker 4>Did you watch that at all?</v>

4904
02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:53.493
<v Speaker 4>Explained?</v>

4905
02:08:53.740 --> 02:08:54.220
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4906
02:08:54.220 --> 02:08:55.053
<v Speaker 4>Who's doing that one?</v>

4907
02:08:55.570 --> 02:08:56.980
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure who's doing that one,</v>

4908
02:08:57.310 --> 02:08:58.630
<v Speaker 4>but it talks about all that stuff.</v>

4909
02:08:58.631 --> 02:08:59.710
<v Speaker 4>Like how,</v>

4910
02:09:00.570 --> 02:09:00.900
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4911
02:09:00.900 --> 02:09:02.040
<v Speaker 4>monogamy with creative.</v>

4912
02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:02.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4913
02:09:02.410 --> 02:09:04.180
<v Speaker 4>How males aren't made for monogamy.</v>

4914
02:09:04.990 --> 02:09:07.900
<v Speaker 4>They're just not all humans are built more for a,</v>

4915
02:09:08.050 --> 02:09:09.250
<v Speaker 4>I explained.</v>

4916
02:09:09.370 --> 02:09:09.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4917
02:09:09.850 --> 02:09:12.220
<v Speaker 4>Well that's probably based on my friend,</v>

4918
02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:14.350
<v Speaker 4>Dr Chris Ryan's book,</v>

4919
02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:15.820
<v Speaker 4>which is sex at dawn,</v>

4920
02:09:15.850 --> 02:09:16.350
<v Speaker 4>which is what,</v>

4921
02:09:16.350 --> 02:09:17.470
<v Speaker 4>is that what it's based on?</v>

4922
02:09:17.471 --> 02:09:17.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4923
02:09:17.760 --> 02:09:18.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4924
02:09:18.330 --> 02:09:19.230
<v Speaker 4>It mentions in him.</v>

4925
02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:19.421
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4926
02:09:19.421 --> 02:09:19.710
<v Speaker 4>he's in.</v>

4927
02:09:19.710 --> 02:09:19.870
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

4928
02:09:19.870 --> 02:09:20.310
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4929
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:20.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4930
02:09:20.500 --> 02:09:22.450
<v Speaker 4>He's a big proponent of that idea,</v>

4931
02:09:22.690 --> 02:09:23.523
<v Speaker 4>which is very,</v>

4932
02:09:23.530 --> 02:09:24.370
<v Speaker 4>it makes a lot of sense.</v>

4933
02:09:24.371 --> 02:09:25.690
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the way chimps behave,</v>

4934
02:09:26.190 --> 02:09:26.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4935
02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:27.880
<v Speaker 4>We were the cousins of chimps,</v>

4936
02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:28.391
<v Speaker 4>chimps.</v>

4937
02:09:28.391 --> 02:09:29.201
<v Speaker 4>Fuck everybody.</v>

4938
02:09:29.201 --> 02:09:30.250
<v Speaker 4>Everybody fucks everybody.</v>

4939
02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:31.091
<v Speaker 4>So the idea is like,</v>

4940
02:09:31.091 --> 02:09:34.720
<v Speaker 4>how did we get to a place where everybody stopped fucking everybody in?</v>

4941
02:09:34.721 --> 02:09:36.760
<v Speaker 4>Somewhere along the line in evolution,</v>

4942
02:09:36.780 --> 02:09:37.780
<v Speaker 4>it's shifted.</v>

4943
02:09:37.960 --> 02:09:39.820
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's the cultural evolution.</v>

4944
02:09:40.270 --> 02:09:40.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4945
02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:41.470
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of theories,</v>

4946
02:09:41.471 --> 02:09:41.800
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4947
02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:42.730
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of theories.</v>

4948
02:09:43.040 --> 02:09:43.270
<v Speaker 4>Check.</v>

4949
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:45.070
<v Speaker 4>Terence Mckenna had some weird ideas about it.</v>

4950
02:09:45.090 --> 02:09:46.510
<v Speaker 4>His theories were all drug based.</v>

4951
02:09:46.570 --> 02:09:46.960
<v Speaker 4>He all,</v>

4952
02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:48.250
<v Speaker 4>he felt there was a mushroom thing.</v>

4953
02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:53.550
<v Speaker 4>He felt like a climate change caused people to move from a mushroom culture to</v>

4954
02:09:54.041 --> 02:09:55.090
<v Speaker 4>an alcohol culture.</v>

4955
02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:56.650
<v Speaker 4>And that the,</v>

4956
02:09:56.651 --> 02:10:00.700
<v Speaker 4>the death of the ego and the expanded consciousness and the community,</v>

4957
02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:01.180
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4958
02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:03.790
<v Speaker 4>feelings that you would get from communal mushroom trips,</v>

4959
02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:07.880
<v Speaker 4>all were replaced by Drunkin assholeishness and,</v>

4960
02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:09.011
<v Speaker 4>and chaos.</v>

4961
02:10:09.011 --> 02:10:09.380
<v Speaker 4>And you,</v>

4962
02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:10.120
<v Speaker 4>he really breaks it.</v>

4963
02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:11.020
<v Speaker 4>He broke it down.</v>

4964
02:10:11.050 --> 02:10:11.950
<v Speaker 4>He's not alive anymore,</v>

4965
02:10:11.951 --> 02:10:12.701
<v Speaker 4>but when he was alive,</v>

4966
02:10:12.701 --> 02:10:14.770
<v Speaker 4>he broke it down pretty eloquently.</v>

4967
02:10:14.771 --> 02:10:15.790
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

4968
02:10:15.791 --> 02:10:18.820
<v Speaker 4>it's not something I'm smart enough to know if he's right or if he's wrong,</v>

4969
02:10:18.821 --> 02:10:21.370
<v Speaker 4>but it's a very compelling argument that people,</v>

4970
02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:25.120
<v Speaker 4>because we know that they used to definitely do a lot of mushrooms.</v>

4971
02:10:25.150 --> 02:10:25.480
<v Speaker 4>They knew,</v>

4972
02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:27.550
<v Speaker 4>we know the Vikings did a lot of mushrooms.</v>

4973
02:10:27.551 --> 02:10:28.090
<v Speaker 4>We knew that.</v>

4974
02:10:28.090 --> 02:10:33.090
<v Speaker 4>We know that there's a bunch of ancient art pieces that show mushrooms and even</v>

4975
02:10:33.201 --> 02:10:36.080
<v Speaker 4>people that were under the spell of the mushroom,</v>

4976
02:10:36.410 --> 02:10:37.071
<v Speaker 4>like a person,</v>

4977
02:10:37.071 --> 02:10:38.060
<v Speaker 4>like a really old one,</v>

4978
02:10:38.061 --> 02:10:39.760
<v Speaker 4>Jack Hara was showing all the bs.</v>

4979
02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:41.450
<v Speaker 4>Jack Hara was his great.</v>

4980
02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:42.560
<v Speaker 4>We'd activist,</v>

4981
02:10:42.650 --> 02:10:42.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4982
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:43.341
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

4983
02:10:43.341 --> 02:10:43.491
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4984
02:10:43.491 --> 02:10:47.330
<v Speaker 4>wrote a book called the emperor has no clothes and saw a book about him being a</v>

4985
02:10:47.331 --> 02:10:51.560
<v Speaker 4>Goldwater Republican and finding marijuana and then becoming like this marijuana</v>

4986
02:10:51.561 --> 02:10:53.630
<v Speaker 4>advocate and be in a hero for marijuana.</v>

4987
02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:56.750
<v Speaker 4>And he was in the middle of writing a book.</v>

4988
02:10:57.590 --> 02:10:58.423
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4989
02:10:58.740 --> 02:11:02.780
<v Speaker 4>and part of the book was about mushrooms and Mushrooms in the history of</v>

4990
02:11:02.781 --> 02:11:03.710
<v Speaker 4>Christianity.</v>

4991
02:11:04.070 --> 02:11:09.070
<v Speaker 4>And he had all this ancient artwork that was all had mushroom iconography,</v>

4992
02:11:09.411 --> 02:11:11.030
<v Speaker 4>like mushroom images in it.</v>

4993
02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:11.931
<v Speaker 4>And he was like,</v>

4994
02:11:11.931 --> 02:11:13.460
<v Speaker 4>the shit was everywhere.</v>

4995
02:11:13.590 --> 02:11:15.800
<v Speaker 4>He unfortunately had a stroke and then wound up dying.</v>

4996
02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:19.230
<v Speaker 4>He was a great man and in the world of uh,</v>

4997
02:11:19.310 --> 02:11:19.941
<v Speaker 4>marijuana,</v>

4998
02:11:19.941 --> 02:11:22.080
<v Speaker 4>he's certainly hero risky,</v>

4999
02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:23.930
<v Speaker 4>risked his neck like way,</v>

5000
02:11:23.931 --> 02:11:25.550
<v Speaker 4>way early on and you know,</v>

5001
02:11:25.551 --> 02:11:27.250
<v Speaker 4>stood by his beliefs and can talk,</v>

5002
02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:28.640
<v Speaker 4>cut a lot of shit for his book,</v>

5003
02:11:28.641 --> 02:11:31.730
<v Speaker 4>but also got a lot of love for how he stood for,</v>

5004
02:11:32.150 --> 02:11:32.571
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5005
02:11:32.571 --> 02:11:34.880
<v Speaker 4>a guy opening up as mine and changing his,</v>

5006
02:11:34.881 --> 02:11:35.530
<v Speaker 4>mind me,</v>

5007
02:11:35.530 --> 02:11:37.160
<v Speaker 4>he was a staunch Republican.</v>

5008
02:11:37.370 --> 02:11:42.350
<v Speaker 4>They started smoking pot and became this crazy pot advocate and his next thing</v>

5009
02:11:42.500 --> 02:11:43.520
<v Speaker 4>was about mushrooms.</v>

5010
02:11:44.090 --> 02:11:44.421
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

5011
02:11:44.421 --> 02:11:45.470
<v Speaker 4>how awesome is that?</v>

5012
02:11:45.570 --> 02:11:46.470
<v Speaker 4>And there's some immune,</v>

5013
02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:48.170
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of stuff out there that you can read.</v>

5014
02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:48.711
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

5015
02:11:48.711 --> 02:11:52.940
<v Speaker 4>it was a lot of good articles online where people have shown there's ancient</v>

5016
02:11:52.941 --> 02:11:57.941
<v Speaker 4>images of Adam and Eve from a fresco and France from like a long fucking time</v>

5017
02:11:58.461 --> 02:11:58.641
<v Speaker 4>ago.</v>

5018
02:11:58.641 --> 02:12:00.140
<v Speaker 4>See if he could see that mush,</v>

5019
02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:03.230
<v Speaker 4>Adam and Eve mushroom fresco,</v>

5020
02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:04.051
<v Speaker 4>just like you were saying,</v>

5021
02:12:04.051 --> 02:12:04.340
<v Speaker 4>John,</v>

5022
02:12:04.340 --> 02:12:04.581
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

5023
02:12:04.581 --> 02:12:05.150
<v Speaker 4>how do we know?</v>

5024
02:12:05.150 --> 02:12:08.150
<v Speaker 4>Like some of that Bible wasn't people writing stories on mushrooms.</v>

5025
02:12:08.210 --> 02:12:08.800
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

5026
02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:09.230
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

5027
02:12:09.230 --> 02:12:09.471
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5028
02:12:09.471 --> 02:12:12.110
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of people that believe it's entirely possible that that's the</v>

5029
02:12:12.111 --> 02:12:12.740
<v Speaker 4>case.</v>

5030
02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:16.550
<v Speaker 4>There was actually a recent scholar from Jerusalem that,</v>

5031
02:12:16.551 --> 02:12:16.911
<v Speaker 4>thanks,</v>

5032
02:12:16.911 --> 02:12:17.241
<v Speaker 4>you see,</v>

5033
02:12:17.241 --> 02:12:21.050
<v Speaker 4>this is the image that's Adam and eve and look at those mushrooms and not even</v>

5034
02:12:21.051 --> 02:12:21.501
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms.</v>

5035
02:12:21.501 --> 02:12:23.240
<v Speaker 4>Iowasca for those Bible stories.</v>

5036
02:12:23.241 --> 02:12:23.541
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

5037
02:12:23.541 --> 02:12:24.220
<v Speaker 4>holy fuck.</v>

5038
02:12:24.220 --> 02:12:24.771
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>

5039
02:12:24.771 --> 02:12:24.951
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5040
02:12:24.951 --> 02:12:27.020
<v Speaker 4>who knows when they figured out Iowasca right,</v>

5041
02:12:27.021 --> 02:12:27.280
<v Speaker 4>and who,</v>

5042
02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:28.250
<v Speaker 4>who got ahold of it?</v>

5043
02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:31.040
<v Speaker 4>We know that they had it in South America thousands of years ago.</v>

5044
02:12:31.041 --> 02:12:31.341
<v Speaker 4>We don't,</v>

5045
02:12:31.341 --> 02:12:33.050
<v Speaker 4>we don't know how many thousands though.</v>

5046
02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:33.561
<v Speaker 4>Apparently.</v>

5047
02:12:33.561 --> 02:12:34.700
<v Speaker 4>It's really hard to figure out.</v>

5048
02:12:34.820 --> 02:12:35.750
<v Speaker 4>But look at that image.</v>

5049
02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:40.340
<v Speaker 4>13th Century Fresco depicting an Adam and eve and the tree of knowledge.</v>

5050
02:12:40.580 --> 02:12:44.210
<v Speaker 4>That tree appears to be modeled after an ama to miscarry a mushroom.</v>

5051
02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:45.573
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5052
02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:46.130
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>

5053
02:12:46.130 --> 02:12:47.240
<v Speaker 4>This is the tree of knowledge.</v>

5054
02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:47.481
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5055
02:12:47.481 --> 02:12:47.721
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

5056
02:12:47.721 --> 02:12:49.400
<v Speaker 4>this is from the 12 hundreds right?</v>

5057
02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:50.660
<v Speaker 4>So this is,</v>

5058
02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:55.400
<v Speaker 4>this is closer to the bone than the original story than we are now in terms of</v>

5059
02:12:56.290 --> 02:12:56.460
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

5060
02:12:56.460 --> 02:12:57.293
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

5061
02:12:57.620 --> 02:13:01.910
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something on the ballot in California to legalize it.</v>

5062
02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:02.290
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

5063
02:13:02.290 --> 02:13:02.931
<v Speaker 4>I hope they do.</v>

5064
02:13:02.931 --> 02:13:04.340
<v Speaker 4>Even if they just do it for therapy.</v>

5065
02:13:04.341 --> 02:13:04.940
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>

5066
02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:05.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5067
02:13:05.330 --> 02:13:10.330
<v Speaker 4>Just there's a lot of these old old pictures that have mushrooms in with a</v>

5068
02:13:11.660 --> 02:13:12.920
<v Speaker 4>religious icons.</v>

5069
02:13:13.490 --> 02:13:14.330
<v Speaker 4>It's real weird,</v>

5070
02:13:14.331 --> 02:13:14.570
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

5071
02:13:14.570 --> 02:13:16.760
<v Speaker 4>Like think of this Jesus with mushrooms and his feet.</v>

5072
02:13:17.810 --> 02:13:19.110
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of crazy,</v>

5073
02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:21.180
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of these really old weird picking it,</v>

5074
02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:23.960
<v Speaker 4>but the thing is like what is it evidence of?</v>

5075
02:13:23.961 --> 02:13:28.490
<v Speaker 4>Is it evidence that mushrooms were involved in the creation of Christianity?</v>

5076
02:13:28.491 --> 02:13:29.031
<v Speaker 4>Possibly,</v>

5077
02:13:29.031 --> 02:13:30.710
<v Speaker 4>but it's also evidence that artists do.</v>

5078
02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:32.913
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5079
02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:33.721
<v Speaker 6>For Real,</v>

5080
02:13:33.721 --> 02:13:34.480
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

5081
02:13:34.480 --> 02:13:35.320
<v Speaker 6>You're a fucking guy.</v>

5082
02:13:35.321 --> 02:13:36.330
<v Speaker 6>He's a paid her back then.</v>

5083
02:13:36.331 --> 02:13:38.880
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you're doing mushrooms all the time and you want to put the mushrooms in</v>

5084
02:13:38.881 --> 02:13:39.714
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>

5085
02:13:39.810 --> 02:13:41.340
<v Speaker 6>We don't really know what I mean.</v>

5086
02:13:42.150 --> 02:13:45.290
<v Speaker 6>Especially if he's doing mushrooms and nobody else even knows what they are.</v>

5087
02:13:45.310 --> 02:13:45.571
<v Speaker 6>He's like,</v>

5088
02:13:45.571 --> 02:13:45.960
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>

5089
02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:46.680
<v Speaker 6>this is one of the,</v>

5090
02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:50.340
<v Speaker 6>but I gotta I gotta think that everybody knew about him back then and they</v>

5091
02:13:50.341 --> 02:13:52.470
<v Speaker 6>probably shared them with people that they cared about.</v>

5092
02:13:52.471 --> 02:13:55.050
<v Speaker 6>Because if you lived in a world with,</v>

5093
02:13:55.170 --> 02:13:56.280
<v Speaker 6>just think of it this way,</v>

5094
02:13:56.820 --> 02:13:59.010
<v Speaker 6>you lived in a world with no media.</v>

5095
02:13:59.370 --> 02:14:00.540
<v Speaker 6>You have no books,</v>

5096
02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:02.040
<v Speaker 6>you have no science.</v>

5097
02:14:02.070 --> 02:14:03.390
<v Speaker 6>You have stories,</v>

5098
02:14:03.391 --> 02:14:05.040
<v Speaker 6>you have a crude language.</v>

5099
02:14:05.070 --> 02:14:06.360
<v Speaker 6>You write things down,</v>

5100
02:14:06.361 --> 02:14:07.530
<v Speaker 6>you draw things.</v>

5101
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:09.090
<v Speaker 6>There's no TV shows,</v>

5102
02:14:09.091 --> 02:14:10.260
<v Speaker 6>there's no cars,</v>

5103
02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:11.460
<v Speaker 6>there's no nothing.</v>

5104
02:14:11.490 --> 02:14:14.430
<v Speaker 6>There's no history of history of talking about shit.</v>

5105
02:14:14.850 --> 02:14:17.400
<v Speaker 6>You wouldn't you think if you found mushrooms,</v>

5106
02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:22.350
<v Speaker 6>if your life suck that much ass like this is the world you're living in his</v>

5107
02:14:22.351 --> 02:14:26.790
<v Speaker 6>barbarian's everywhere and you'd get fucking step on a thorn and you get</v>

5108
02:14:26.791 --> 02:14:29.850
<v Speaker 6>poisoned in your body and you die because no one has antibiotics.</v>

5109
02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:31.590
<v Speaker 6>You get an infection from a cut,</v>

5110
02:14:31.591 --> 02:14:32.424
<v Speaker 6>you're dead.</v>

5111
02:14:32.580 --> 02:14:33.090
<v Speaker 6>I mean this is,</v>

5112
02:14:33.090 --> 02:14:34.890
<v Speaker 6>this is how people existed back then.</v>

5113
02:14:34.891 --> 02:14:37.860
<v Speaker 6>Do you think if they found mushrooms that they,</v>

5114
02:14:38.190 --> 02:14:39.780
<v Speaker 6>they wouldn't cherish them like that?</v>

5115
02:14:39.781 --> 02:14:42.300
<v Speaker 6>Someone would somehow under the demonize them for real.</v>

5116
02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:43.140
<v Speaker 6>Seriously.</v>

5117
02:14:43.140 --> 02:14:44.130
<v Speaker 6>If they had nothing else,</v>

5118
02:14:44.131 --> 02:14:45.360
<v Speaker 6>why would they demonize mushrooms?</v>

5119
02:14:45.361 --> 02:14:47.400
<v Speaker 6>They demonized it after they figured it out.</v>

5120
02:14:47.730 --> 02:14:48.600
<v Speaker 6>After they figured out like,</v>

5121
02:14:48.601 --> 02:14:48.960
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

5122
02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:51.840
<v Speaker 6>like they probably went big gaps without having it.</v>

5123
02:14:52.020 --> 02:14:52.890
<v Speaker 6>That's the theory.</v>

5124
02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:56.520
<v Speaker 6>They probably don't like big gaps where mushrooms weren't apart of culture</v>

5125
02:14:56.521 --> 02:14:58.350
<v Speaker 6>anymore and then people tried to reintroduce them,</v>

5126
02:14:58.470 --> 02:15:01.920
<v Speaker 6>but culture had already gone in this weird sort of violent champ.</v>

5127
02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:03.180
<v Speaker 6>Alcohol,</v>

5128
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:04.890
<v Speaker 6>amphetamines way.</v>

5129
02:15:05.460 --> 02:15:06.240
<v Speaker 6>Damn,</v>

5130
02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:06.960
<v Speaker 6>damn,</v>

5131
02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:07.620
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

5132
02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:08.453
<v Speaker 6>fuck.</v>

5133
02:15:08.490 --> 02:15:09.323
<v Speaker 6>Oh</v>

5134
02:15:10.590 --> 02:15:10.741
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

5135
02:15:10.741 --> 02:15:12.240
<v Speaker 6>It's not like we're making something up.</v>

5136
02:15:12.241 --> 02:15:15.330
<v Speaker 6>Like this is some Alice in wonderland book where there's some medicine that says</v>

5137

<v Speaker 6>how tough it was,</v>

5145
02:15:29.790 --> 02:15:34.050
<v Speaker 6>you wonder if they had dislike as much happiness as we have if there are more</v>

5146

<v Speaker 6>positive thinking or what?</v>

02:15:35.100 --> 02:15:35.731
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what I mean.</v>

5148
02:15:35.731 --> 02:15:38.430
<v Speaker 6>Like it's a good question because they didn't know any better.</v>

<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

5169
02:16:05.701 --> 02:16:07.710
<v Speaker 6>It was like they're all really happy and he was like,</v>

02:16:07.711 --> 02:16:10.260
<v Speaker 6>how many people do you think in the real world are really happy?</v>

<v Speaker 5>super lucky.</v>

5200
02:16:39.971 --> 02:16:41.080
<v Speaker 5>Anybody out there that's listening,</v>

5201
02:16:41.081 --> 02:16:42.010
<v Speaker 5>it's doing what they want.</v>

5202
02:16:42.190 --> 02:16:46.690
<v Speaker 5>Whether you're making furniture or painting pictures or singing songs,</v>

5203
02:16:46.691 --> 02:16:47.620
<v Speaker 5>what are the fuck you're doing?</v>

5204
02:16:47.621 --> 02:16:49.900
<v Speaker 5>If that's what you really want to do and you're happy.</v>

5205
02:16:49.930 --> 02:16:50.101
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

5206
02:16:50.101 --> 02:16:51.430
<v Speaker 5>You gotta pay it back.</v>

5207
02:16:51.431 --> 02:16:52.810
<v Speaker 5>And even if you're not making a fortune,</v>

5208
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:53.321
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

5209
02:16:53.321 --> 02:16:53.831
<v Speaker 5>you listen.</v>

5210
02:16:53.831 --> 02:16:55.810
<v Speaker 5>If you're getting by and doing what you like,</v>

5211
02:16:55.811 --> 02:16:57.730
<v Speaker 5>it's so much better than being rich,</v>

5212
02:16:57.731 --> 02:17:02.650
<v Speaker 5>doing what you hate because your time is what's so valuable when you know if you</v>

5213
02:17:02.651 --> 02:17:04.600
<v Speaker 5>have a job and you hate it,</v>

5214
02:17:05.140 --> 02:17:06.610
<v Speaker 5>but it gives you a lot of money and you say,</v>

5215
02:17:06.611 --> 02:17:06.731
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

5216
02:17:06.731 --> 02:17:07.840
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to get out of it eventually.</v>

5217
02:17:07.841 --> 02:17:11.500
<v Speaker 5>The problem is that time that you need to do that job at eight hours,</v>

5218
02:17:11.920 --> 02:17:14.020
<v Speaker 5>that's a giant chunk of your day,</v>

5219
02:17:14.050 --> 02:17:15.910
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of people don't have passions too.</v>

5220
02:17:16.090 --> 02:17:17.050
<v Speaker 5>What would they be doing?</v>

5221
02:17:17.051 --> 02:17:17.950
<v Speaker 5>Those was eight hours a day.</v>

5222
02:17:18.190 --> 02:17:19.280
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people don't even know.</v>

5223
02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:22.210
<v Speaker 5>They look like my dad gets off work and goes to work.</v>

5224
02:17:22.211 --> 02:17:22.480
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

5225
02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:23.080
<v Speaker 5>what is he doing?</v>

5226
02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:23.913
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5227
02:17:24.220 --> 02:17:25.390
<v Speaker 5>what do you want to get good at?</v>

5228
02:17:25.391 --> 02:17:25.860
<v Speaker 5>What do you,</v>

5229
02:17:25.860 --> 02:17:26.681
<v Speaker 5>what are you passion about?</v>

5230
02:17:26.681 --> 02:17:27.461
<v Speaker 5>What do you want to do?</v>

5231
02:17:27.461 --> 02:17:31.090
<v Speaker 5>And it's easier for like this newer day and age to look on the Internet and</v>

5232
02:17:31.091 --> 02:17:33.160
<v Speaker 5>learn things on the Internet and see people on the Internet doing.</v>

5233
02:17:33.161 --> 02:17:33.400
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like,</v>

5234
02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:33.521
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

5235
02:17:33.521 --> 02:17:33.911
<v Speaker 5>they're doing it.</v>

5236
02:17:33.911 --> 02:17:35.470
<v Speaker 5>I'm not doing it in our parents' generation.</v>

5237
02:17:35.471 --> 02:17:36.304
<v Speaker 5>They didn't have that.</v>

5238
02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:37.870
<v Speaker 5>Everyone did it and they had no,</v>

5239
02:17:38.110 --> 02:17:38.943
<v Speaker 5>it was rare.</v>

5240
02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:42.940
<v Speaker 5>You're super lucky if you find a passion that you,</v>

5241
02:17:43.430 --> 02:17:43.810
<v Speaker 5>gosh,</v>

5242
02:17:43.810 --> 02:17:46.420
<v Speaker 5>at a young age and back then everybody was scared,</v>

5243
02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:47.111
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

5244
02:17:47.111 --> 02:17:48.700
<v Speaker 5>So they would always tell people don't,</v>

5245
02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:49.720
<v Speaker 5>don't do that.</v>

5246
02:17:50.050 --> 02:17:51.310
<v Speaker 5>Don't take any risks,</v>

5247
02:17:51.430 --> 02:17:52.300
<v Speaker 5>play it safe.</v>

5248
02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:53.890
<v Speaker 5>Get that good job.</v>

5249
02:17:54.130 --> 02:17:54.401
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5250
02:17:54.401 --> 02:17:55.450
<v Speaker 5>they're given benefits.</v>

5251
02:17:55.630 --> 02:17:56.530
<v Speaker 5>You'll get your degree,</v>

5252
02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:57.873
<v Speaker 5>play it safe,</v>

5253
02:17:58.090 --> 02:17:58.361
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

5254
02:17:58.361 --> 02:17:59.870
<v Speaker 5>Well if you have a degree then you'll have to,</v>

5255
02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:01.360
<v Speaker 5>you'll definitely have a backup plan.</v>

5256
02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:02.111
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

5257
02:18:02.111 --> 02:18:03.280
<v Speaker 5>you want to have a safety net.</v>

5258
02:18:03.610 --> 02:18:04.630
<v Speaker 5>Everyone back then was,</v>

5259
02:18:04.720 --> 02:18:06.730
<v Speaker 5>their parents had been in the fucking depression.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

5261
02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:08.650

5262
02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:10.030
<v Speaker 5>people are kind of telling me like,</v>

5263

5267
02:18:15.101 --> 02:18:16.300
<v Speaker 5>Like you want to see and be like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>But as life gets more and more complicated to get older and older,</v>

5280
02:18:42.311 --> 02:18:43.840
<v Speaker 5>your body starts failing.</v>

5281
02:18:44.110 --> 02:18:48.250
<v Speaker 5>You got to stay on your exercise program or you feel yourself to tea where</v>

5282
02:18:48.251 --> 02:18:48.910
<v Speaker 5>you're rating.</v>

5283
02:18:48.910 --> 02:18:51.730
<v Speaker 5>Like you've realized like how long can I keep this up?</v>

5284
02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:52.960
<v Speaker 5>How long can I keep this going?</v>

5285
02:18:53.380 --> 02:18:54.110
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

5286
02:18:54.110 --> 02:18:57.670
<v Speaker 5>And and also people who have been doing what they don't want to do for 20 years</v>

5287
02:18:57.671 --> 02:18:59.980
<v Speaker 5>now waiting to retire 25 years.</v>

5288
02:19:00.110 --> 02:19:00.810
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

5289
02:19:00.810 --> 02:19:01.810
<v Speaker 5>To me,</v>

5290
02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:04.120
<v Speaker 5>my number one for sure,</v>

5291
02:19:04.290 --> 02:19:07.360
<v Speaker 5>the most fortunate thing is the people that I'm friends with.</v>

5292
02:19:07.361 --> 02:19:10.190
<v Speaker 5>And then I love my family and people I'm close to though.</v>

5293
02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:14.740
<v Speaker 5>I'm close to a bunch of really positive people that have similar mindsets to</v>

5294
02:19:14.741 --> 02:19:18.460
<v Speaker 5>yours about eating healthy and taking care of yourself at that for sure.</v>

5295
02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:20.140
<v Speaker 5>Also about being nice.</v>

5296
02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:21.160
<v Speaker 5>That's salt,</v>

5297
02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:22.330
<v Speaker 5>that's real important.</v>

5298
02:19:22.331 --> 02:19:25.540
<v Speaker 5>Being around a bunch of people that are cool to each other and then to doing</v>

5299
02:19:25.541 --> 02:19:26.470
<v Speaker 5>what I want to do.</v>

5300
02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 5>Cause I didn't do what I</v>

5301
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:29.360
<v Speaker 4>want to do and I've looked,</v>

5302
02:19:29.450 --> 02:19:32.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to anybody to cry for me that I was on fear factor.</v>

5303
02:19:32.390 --> 02:19:34.010
<v Speaker 4>It's not like it was a bad job.</v>

5304
02:19:34.011 --> 02:19:36.620
<v Speaker 4>I would've taken it again in a heartbeat if I was in the same situation.</v>

5305
02:19:36.621 --> 02:19:37.454
<v Speaker 4>It was great.</v>

5306
02:19:37.610 --> 02:19:37.821
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5307
02:19:37.821 --> 02:19:38.060
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

5308
02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:39.110
<v Speaker 4>it offered me money,</v>

5309
02:19:39.140 --> 02:19:42.230
<v Speaker 4>a lot of money to do a show that wasn't anything I wanted to do.</v>

5310
02:19:42.260 --> 02:19:43.580
<v Speaker 4>Like it wasn't a sitcom,</v>

5311
02:19:43.850 --> 02:19:45.330
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't doing standup comedy.</v>

5312
02:19:45.331 --> 02:19:46.310
<v Speaker 4>It was this weird thing,</v>

5313
02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:47.630
<v Speaker 4>but it was a great job.</v>

5314
02:19:47.660 --> 02:19:48.493
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm not,</v>

5315
02:19:48.890 --> 02:19:49.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm not hating on it,</v>

5316
02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:51.740
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't feel the same way.</v>

5317
02:19:51.741 --> 02:19:53.750
<v Speaker 4>Even though I'm very thankful that I got that job.</v>

5318
02:19:53.751 --> 02:19:58.580
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't feel the same way as it would if I was say doing a podcast or doing</v>

5319
02:19:58.581 --> 02:20:00.230
<v Speaker 4>standup or just doing whatever I want to do.</v>

5320
02:20:00.231 --> 02:20:01.820
<v Speaker 4>We're not off to what I have to.</v>

5321
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:06.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to do something just because it's my job.</v>

5322
02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:07.731
<v Speaker 4>Instead,</v>

5323
02:20:07.731 --> 02:20:09.590
<v Speaker 4>I do it because I actually like to do it.</v>

5324
02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:12.380
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to watch your p's and q's all the time cause you're in the</v>

5325
02:20:12.381 --> 02:20:14.300
<v Speaker 4>corporate world and be watching yourself.</v>

5326
02:20:14.301 --> 02:20:14.720
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

5327
02:20:14.720 --> 02:20:14.991
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5328
02:20:14.991 --> 02:20:16.100
<v Speaker 4>I fuck up all the time.</v>

5329
02:20:16.101 --> 02:20:17.600
<v Speaker 4>I say stupid things all the time.</v>

5330
02:20:17.601 --> 02:20:17.991
<v Speaker 4>If people are like,</v>

5331
02:20:17.991 --> 02:20:18.561
<v Speaker 4>why'd you say that?</v>

5332
02:20:18.561 --> 02:20:21.860
<v Speaker 4>Am I because I'm free ball and I'm say things off the top of my head for hours</v>

5333
02:20:21.861 --> 02:20:23.120
<v Speaker 4>at a time or a case.</v>

5334
02:20:23.121 --> 02:20:23.361
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5335
02:20:23.361 --> 02:20:25.130
<v Speaker 4>Occasionally I'll say something stupid.</v>

5336
02:20:25.370 --> 02:20:26.750
<v Speaker 4>I take a swing and a miss.</v>

5337
02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:27.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5338
02:20:27.220 --> 02:20:27.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5339
02:20:27.710 --> 02:20:28.320
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

5340
02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:28.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5341
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:29.990
<v Speaker 4>ultimately it's,</v>

5342
02:20:30.830 --> 02:20:31.221
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5343
02:20:31.221 --> 02:20:31.471
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

5344
02:20:31.471 --> 02:20:33.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try to police myself as best as I can,</v>

5345
02:20:33.891 --> 02:20:37.670
<v Speaker 4>but it's just so much better than having to piece somebody.</v>

5346
02:20:37.671 --> 02:20:40.550
<v Speaker 4>It gives you a chance to get better at your own shit.</v>

5347
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.331
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5348
02:20:41.331 --> 02:20:42.230
<v Speaker 4>whatever you're doing,</v>

5349
02:20:42.231 --> 02:20:45.530
<v Speaker 4>if you can work for yourself or figure out a way to do the thing that you really</v>

5350
02:20:45.531 --> 02:20:46.364
<v Speaker 4>want to do,</v>

5351
02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:49.310
<v Speaker 4>it gives you a chance to get better at the thing that interests you.</v>

5352
02:20:49.311 --> 02:20:50.710
<v Speaker 4>The thing that's fascinating.</v>

5353
02:20:50.720 --> 02:20:50.771
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5354
02:20:50.771 --> 02:20:50.840
<v Speaker 4>Mean</v>

5355
02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:51.660
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>

5356
02:20:51.660 --> 02:20:51.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5357
02:20:51.901 --> 02:20:52.521
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty sweet.</v>

5358
02:20:52.521 --> 02:20:53.251
<v Speaker 2>It's super lucky.</v>

5359
02:20:53.251 --> 02:20:54.030
<v Speaker 2>When I was,</v>

5360
02:20:54.030 --> 02:20:55.170
<v Speaker 2>when I first moved to Arizona,</v>

5361
02:20:55.171 --> 02:20:55.500
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

5362
02:20:55.500 --> 02:20:56.340
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have to work,</v>

5363
02:20:56.341 --> 02:20:58.950
<v Speaker 2>I'd like sponsored local sponsors back in Montana.</v>

5364
02:20:59.490 --> 02:21:00.323
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5365
02:21:01.090 --> 02:21:01.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

5366
02:21:01.770 --> 02:21:02.910
<v Speaker 2>this thing bar the one,</v>

5367
02:21:03.050 --> 02:21:04.670
<v Speaker 2>give them a shout out this thing.</v>

5368
02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:05.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5369
02:21:05.130 --> 02:21:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Elliot Smith and Jones labs construction.</v>

5370
02:21:07.171 --> 02:21:07.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5371
02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:08.440
<v Speaker 2>Their lunch.</v>

5372
02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:11.100
<v Speaker 2>That just for a small town companies that work and I,</v>

5373
02:21:11.550 --> 02:21:16.110
<v Speaker 2>I was able to put all of my time into learning how to eat healthy,</v>

5374
02:21:16.180 --> 02:21:19.110
<v Speaker 2>learning how to use my brain and training.</v>

5375
02:21:19.140 --> 02:21:20.690
<v Speaker 2>Like I got to use all my time for that.</v>

5376
02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:21.810
<v Speaker 2>I was so lucky for that.</v>

5377
02:21:21.811 --> 02:21:22.644
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

5378
02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:23.860
<v Speaker 2>and it's not,</v>

5379
02:21:23.860 --> 02:21:25.110
<v Speaker 2>it's huge for young fighters,</v>

5380
02:21:25.111 --> 02:21:25.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5381
02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:29.070
<v Speaker 2>getting a cool business and what's to put their logo on your shorts or something</v>

5382
02:21:29.071 --> 02:21:29.904
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

5383
02:21:29.910 --> 02:21:31.980
<v Speaker 2>That's where we benefited from coming from a small town.</v>

5384
02:21:31.981 --> 02:21:34.230
<v Speaker 2>We racked up a lot of experience.</v>

5385
02:21:34.410 --> 02:21:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Like in Phoenix there's amateur fighters that they can't get fights for the life</v>

5386
02:21:37.621 --> 02:21:38.230
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

5387
02:21:38.230 --> 02:21:40.080
<v Speaker 2>We could fight every weekend if we wanted to.</v>

5388
02:21:40.081 --> 02:21:42.990
<v Speaker 2>So we got a lot of re reading experience and got comfortable in there.</v>

5389
02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:43.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5390
02:21:43.651 --> 02:21:45.420
<v Speaker 2>there's a crazy Midwest circuit,</v>

5391
02:21:45.421 --> 02:21:45.750
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5392
02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

5393
02:21:45.990 --> 02:21:49.590
<v Speaker 2>that's why Jeremy Horn has over a hundred fights and Travis Fulton was,</v>

5394
02:21:49.591 --> 02:21:51.050
<v Speaker 2>he have like 200 plus fights.</v>

5395
02:21:51.150 --> 02:21:51.983
<v Speaker 2>Crazy like that,</v>

5396
02:21:52.260 --> 02:21:53.250
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of those dudes,</v>

5397
02:21:53.251 --> 02:21:55.740
<v Speaker 2>you mean you could literally fight constantly all the time?</v>

5398
02:21:55.770 --> 02:21:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

5399
02:21:56.130 --> 02:21:58.110
<v Speaker 2>I fought three weekends in a row once I remember that.</v>

5400
02:21:58.170 --> 02:21:59.070
<v Speaker 2>That's nuts.</v>

5401
02:21:59.760 --> 02:22:01.950
<v Speaker 2>But don't you get super loose when you do that?</v>

5402
02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:03.830
<v Speaker 2>You get like used to it.</v>

5403
02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:04.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5404
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:06.300
<v Speaker 2>The experience is different,</v>

5405
02:22:06.301 --> 02:22:06.481
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5406
02:22:06.481 --> 02:22:07.230
<v Speaker 2>It feels normal.</v>

5407
02:22:07.230 --> 02:22:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

5408
02:22:07.980 --> 02:22:08.700
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

5409
02:22:08.700 --> 02:22:12.260
<v Speaker 2>I remember going into like bigger fights and people would kind of thing to get</v>

5410
02:22:12.261 --> 02:22:12.571
<v Speaker 2>anything there.</v>

5411
02:22:12.571 --> 02:22:13.090
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

5412
02:22:13.090 --> 02:22:13.801
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I will.</v>

5413
02:22:13.801 --> 02:22:16.080
<v Speaker 2>I just don't get like before if I don't feel nervous,</v>

5414
02:22:16.081 --> 02:22:16.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

5415
02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:17.113
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel?</v>

5416
02:22:17.220 --> 02:22:18.090
<v Speaker 2>I feel calm.</v>

5417
02:22:18.091 --> 02:22:20.760
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I feel like I'm just calm,</v>

5418
02:22:20.850 --> 02:22:22.100
<v Speaker 2>just ready for,</v>

5419
02:22:22.140 --> 02:22:23.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm just waiting for,</v>

5420
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:27.030
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm really the now and I'm just waiting for to get there.</v>

5421
02:22:27.031 --> 02:22:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

5422
02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:28.680
<v Speaker 2>what are you thinking about?</v>

5423
02:22:29.660 --> 02:22:30.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

5424
02:22:30.300 --> 02:22:31.081
<v Speaker 2>I feel calm.</v>

5425
02:22:31.081 --> 02:22:31.471
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5426
02:22:31.471 --> 02:22:33.540
<v Speaker 2>It's just super confident.</v>

5427
02:22:33.541 --> 02:22:34.374
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

5428
02:22:34.430 --> 02:22:34.920
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

5429
02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:35.341
<v Speaker 2>in my head,</v>

5430
02:22:35.341 --> 02:22:35.851
<v Speaker 2>I'm going in there,</v>

5431
02:22:35.851 --> 02:22:36.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to knock this dude out.</v>

5432
02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:37.950
<v Speaker 2>Whether I do or don't.</v>

5433
02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:38.671
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm,</v>

5434
02:22:38.671 --> 02:22:39.270
<v Speaker 2>that's what every,</v>

5435
02:22:39.270 --> 02:22:40.170
<v Speaker 2>every fight I get into.</v>

5436
02:22:40.171 --> 02:22:42.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm going in there thinking I'm gonna knock this dude out every fight.</v>

5437
02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:44.700
<v Speaker 2>And I truly feel that,</v>

5438
02:22:44.790 --> 02:22:46.050
<v Speaker 2>I believe that in myself.</v>

5439
02:22:46.290 --> 02:22:48.810
<v Speaker 2>And it all comes from how prepared you are.</v>

5440
02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:50.910
<v Speaker 2>He's always doing every single thing,</v>

5441
02:22:50.911 --> 02:22:51.310
<v Speaker 2>not like,</v>

5442
02:22:51.310 --> 02:22:52.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be lazy today.</v>

5443
02:22:52.740 --> 02:22:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Every sing he has to do,</v>

5444
02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:58.200
<v Speaker 2>and that's the reason he feels so fucking prepared and can focus on her</v>

5445
02:22:58.201 --> 02:23:00.600
<v Speaker 2>techniques and can focus on that instead of focus on,</v>

5446
02:23:00.630 --> 02:23:00.811
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5447
02:23:00.811 --> 02:23:05.490
<v Speaker 2>am I going to gas or did I train hard enough or fuck all that nonsense shit.</v>

5448
02:23:05.840 --> 02:23:06.673
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5449
02:23:07.830 --> 02:23:08.191
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5450
02:23:08.191 --> 02:23:12.690
<v Speaker 6>I was listening to someone talk about that the other day that wish I could</v>

5451
02:23:12.691 --> 02:23:14.250
<v Speaker 6>remember who was having this conversation.</v>

5452
02:23:14.730 --> 02:23:16.110
<v Speaker 6>It might've been my friend John Dudley,</v>

5453
02:23:16.111 --> 02:23:20.250
<v Speaker 6>but he was talking about how when people aren't prepared for things that it</v>

5454
02:23:20.310 --> 02:23:25.310
<v Speaker 6>gives you like another layer of insecurity on top of the insecurity of doing</v>

5455
02:23:26.161 --> 02:23:27.750
<v Speaker 6>something that's difficult in the first place.</v>

5456
02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:29.580
<v Speaker 6>So if you know that you're not like,</v>

5457
02:23:29.581 --> 02:23:32.940
<v Speaker 6>maybe you're good at it but you're just lazy and you didn't really practice and</v>

5458
02:23:32.941 --> 02:23:34.260
<v Speaker 6>then you're going to go and try and do something,</v>

5459
02:23:34.261 --> 02:23:36.540
<v Speaker 6>but you know these other people are practice much harder than you have.</v>

5460
02:23:36.930 --> 02:23:41.930
<v Speaker 6>That layer is even if you're a talented person that's like that has an effect on</v>

5461
02:23:42.871 --> 02:23:46.860
<v Speaker 6>your actions and if you've done everything you can do,</v>

5462
02:23:46.861 --> 02:23:50.220
<v Speaker 6>you've dotted all your i's and crossed all your t's.</v>

5463
02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:52.050
<v Speaker 6>If you've done that,</v>

5464
02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:54.690
<v Speaker 6>you'll have a different level of confidence.</v>

5465
02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:55.860
<v Speaker 6>You might still lose,</v>

5466
02:23:55.861 --> 02:23:56.101
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

5467
02:23:56.101 --> 02:23:58.860
<v Speaker 6>It's a crazy way to make live in the chips fall where they may,</v>

5468
02:23:59.100 --> 02:24:04.100
<v Speaker 6>but at least you'll know that you gave 100% now if you lose and you didn't give</v>

5469
02:24:04.951 --> 02:24:06.930
<v Speaker 6>100% you definitely still have.</v>

5470
02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:09.840
<v Speaker 6>You always have that in the back of your head as like a fallback.</v>

5471
02:24:10.140 --> 02:24:10.351
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

5472
02:24:10.351 --> 02:24:14.700
<v Speaker 6>I know I didn't really give 100% but you could say,</v>

5473
02:24:14.701 --> 02:24:14.911
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

5474
02:24:14.911 --> 02:24:15.241
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

5475
02:24:15.241 --> 02:24:16.590
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to get my shit together now,</v>

5476
02:24:16.591 --> 02:24:20.370
<v Speaker 6>but the problem is you've already gone through the experience of not giving 100%</v>

5477
02:24:20.371 --> 02:24:24.450
<v Speaker 6>which is very precarious because it could be a confidence destroyer could fuck</v>

5478
02:24:24.451 --> 02:24:25.620
<v Speaker 6>your head up for the rest of your life.</v>

5479
02:24:25.621 --> 02:24:28.980
<v Speaker 6>It could change who you are because it's very difficult for people to overcome</v>

5480
02:24:28.981 --> 02:24:33.330
<v Speaker 6>the past like ideas that they have about themselves from a year ago or five</v>

5481
02:24:33.331 --> 02:24:34.164
<v Speaker 6>years ago.</v>

5482
02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:35.890
<v Speaker 6>That is not you and you.</v>

5483
02:24:35.900 --> 02:24:36.570
<v Speaker 6>You have to,</v>

5484
02:24:36.570 --> 02:24:40.430
<v Speaker 6>especially in something as critical as like fight skills and learning,</v>

5485
02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:42.690
<v Speaker 6>learning how to become confident again.</v>

5486
02:24:42.930 --> 02:24:43.770
<v Speaker 6>That's not you.</v>

5487
02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:44.461
<v Speaker 6>That was you.</v>

5488
02:24:44.461 --> 02:24:48.360
<v Speaker 6>Then your better now embrace the fact that you're better.</v>

5489
02:24:48.361 --> 02:24:53.361
<v Speaker 6>Don't dwell on bad moments where you got flattened or you're fucked up or you</v>

5490
02:24:54.391 --> 02:24:56.580
<v Speaker 6>did something stupid or you got caught in an arm bar,</v>

5491
02:24:56.730 --> 02:24:57.720
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck it is,</v>

5492
02:24:57.900 --> 02:25:02.820
<v Speaker 6>those things they can get in your head and you can decide you're that person or</v>

5493
02:25:02.821 --> 02:25:03.750
<v Speaker 6>you can decide,</v>

5494
02:25:03.930 --> 02:25:04.763
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

5495
02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:07.920
<v Speaker 6>I've passed that now I'm way better because of that.</v>

5496
02:25:07.921 --> 02:25:11.760
<v Speaker 6>I'm thankful that happened because that taught me as super valuable lesson and</v>

5497
02:25:11.761 --> 02:25:15.550
<v Speaker 6>without that humiliation and that defeat or that misstep or you know,</v>

5498
02:25:15.650 --> 02:25:16.830
<v Speaker 6>whatever that error was,</v>

5499
02:25:16.831 --> 02:25:18.900
<v Speaker 6>I would know who I really am right now.</v>

5500
02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:19.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5501
02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:23.110
<v Speaker 6>It's like classic sports psychology stuff and you can't just read it one to be</v>

5502
02:25:23.111 --> 02:25:23.261
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

5503
02:25:23.261 --> 02:25:23.621
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

5504
02:25:23.621 --> 02:25:24.180
<v Speaker 6>I get that.</v>

5505
02:25:24.180 --> 02:25:26.920
<v Speaker 6>You got to fucking just wrap it in your head wrapped around your head.</v>

5506
02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:27.850
<v Speaker 6>And I think,</v>

5507
02:25:27.850 --> 02:25:29.350
<v Speaker 6>I truly think in a fist fight.</v>

5508
02:25:29.410 --> 02:25:31.240
<v Speaker 6>The number one thing is confidence.</v>

5509
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:34.600
<v Speaker 6>And I know that confidence comes from training and also helps to have that</v>

5510
02:25:34.601 --> 02:25:35.201
<v Speaker 6>fucking rumble.</v>

5511
02:25:35.201 --> 02:25:36.310
<v Speaker 6>Johnson power sun,</v>

5512
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:40.450
<v Speaker 6>that might also be a</v>

5513
02:25:42.190 --> 02:25:43.120
<v Speaker 6>rumble Johnson,</v>

5514
02:25:43.130 --> 02:25:43.361
<v Speaker 6>Cory,</v>

5515
02:25:43.361 --> 02:25:44.760
<v Speaker 6>you rely on people,</v>

5516
02:25:45.160 --> 02:25:46.360
<v Speaker 6>you rely on it too much.</v>

5517
02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:48.850
<v Speaker 6>And that's why I don't necessarily think he relied on the too much,</v>

5518
02:25:49.490 --> 02:25:53.290
<v Speaker 6>but I really think about rumble is rumble was better than he was,</v>

5519
02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:53.890
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5520
02:25:53.890 --> 02:25:55.330
<v Speaker 6>enthusiastic about fighting.</v>

5521
02:25:55.720 --> 02:25:56.680
<v Speaker 6>He was a better fight.</v>

5522
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:57.910
<v Speaker 6>Like he said it,</v>

5523
02:25:58.060 --> 02:25:59.950
<v Speaker 6>he was a phenomenal knockout artists.</v>

5524
02:25:59.951 --> 02:26:00.161
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5525
02:26:00.161 --> 02:26:02.170
<v Speaker 6>rumble put it to people,</v>

5526
02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:02.651
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5527
02:26:02.651 --> 02:26:03.520
<v Speaker 6>a spooky way.</v>

5528
02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:05.140
<v Speaker 6>He would cry when he knocked out,</v>

5529
02:26:05.141 --> 02:26:08.020
<v Speaker 6>glow over to shower and to share that one upper cut.</v>

5530
02:26:08.050 --> 02:26:08.883
<v Speaker 6>Boom.</v>

5531
02:26:08.890 --> 02:26:12.520
<v Speaker 6>You've watched that precision and the power that guy generated.</v>

5532
02:26:12.580 --> 02:26:13.121
<v Speaker 6>Damn.</v>

5533
02:26:13.121 --> 02:26:13.954
<v Speaker 6>He was scary.</v>

5534
02:26:14.050 --> 02:26:14.501
<v Speaker 6>Damn.</v>

5535
02:26:14.501 --> 02:26:15.334
<v Speaker 6>He was scared,</v>

5536
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:17.050
<v Speaker 6>but when bill said,</v>

5537
02:26:17.051 --> 02:26:17.741
<v Speaker 6>when he retired,</v>

5538
02:26:17.741 --> 02:26:17.981
<v Speaker 6>he said,</v>

5539
02:26:17.981 --> 02:26:18.311
<v Speaker 6>hey man.</v>

5540
02:26:18.311 --> 02:26:18.551
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

5541
02:26:18.551 --> 02:26:19.361
<v Speaker 6>I'm just good at this.</v>

5542
02:26:19.361 --> 02:26:19.541
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

5543
02:26:19.541 --> 02:26:20.374
<v Speaker 6>I'm not a fighter.</v>

5544
02:26:20.530 --> 02:26:21.000
<v Speaker 6>He was,</v>

5545
02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:21.833
<v Speaker 6>I'm an athlete.</v>

5546
02:26:22.020 --> 02:26:22.241
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

5547
02:26:22.241 --> 02:26:22.991
<v Speaker 6>I'm just good at this.</v>

5548
02:26:22.991 --> 02:26:23.850
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to do this anymore.</v>

5549
02:26:23.860 --> 02:26:24.820
<v Speaker 6>I could do a lot of other things.</v>

5550
02:26:24.821 --> 02:26:28.000
<v Speaker 6>It was like good for you and your fucking at the top of your game.</v>

5551
02:26:28.420 --> 02:26:30.190
<v Speaker 6>Everyone's scared of you and you're like,</v>

5552
02:26:30.191 --> 02:26:30.581
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

5553
02:26:30.581 --> 02:26:31.151
<v Speaker 6>I'm good at those.</v>

5554
02:26:31.151 --> 02:26:31.984
<v Speaker 6>I mean like it,</v>

5555
02:26:33.020 --> 02:26:34.540
<v Speaker 6>I'm going into the weed business.</v>

5556
02:26:34.750 --> 02:26:35.470
<v Speaker 6>Fuck yeah.</v>

5557
02:26:35.470 --> 02:26:35.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5558
02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:36.860
<v Speaker 6>I mean rumble is a,</v>

5559
02:26:36.890 --> 02:26:38.020
<v Speaker 6>he's a special person,</v>

5560
02:26:38.290 --> 02:26:40.570
<v Speaker 6>but that kind of thing that he has,</v>

5561
02:26:40.690 --> 02:26:42.820
<v Speaker 6>he's got that one touch gift.</v>

5562
02:26:42.880 --> 02:26:43.691
<v Speaker 6>I mean for sure.</v>

5563
02:26:43.691 --> 02:26:45.010
<v Speaker 6>Technique for sure.</v>

5564
02:26:45.130 --> 02:26:47.230
<v Speaker 6>Years of training for sure.</v>

5565
02:26:47.231 --> 02:26:49.750
<v Speaker 6>Smart knows how to execute and close the distance.</v>

5566
02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:52.090
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of excellent variables on his side,</v>

5567
02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:56.380
<v Speaker 6>but there's one thing that he possesses that most human beings are never going</v>

5568
02:26:56.381 --> 02:26:56.650
<v Speaker 6>to get.</v>

5569
02:26:56.650 --> 02:26:57.580
<v Speaker 6>No matter how they try.</v>

5570
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:59.320
<v Speaker 6>They're not going to get that power.</v>

5571
02:26:59.590 --> 02:27:00.850
<v Speaker 6>He's got that weird power.</v>

5572
02:27:01.150 --> 02:27:02.380
<v Speaker 6>There's a few people that just have their,</v>

5573
02:27:02.381 --> 02:27:03.850
<v Speaker 6>they got that weird power man,</v>

5574
02:27:03.851 --> 02:27:08.620
<v Speaker 6>that fat fast twitch muscle that gases out quick or the slow twitch muscle like</v>

5575
02:27:08.621 --> 02:27:10.840
<v Speaker 6>Nick Diaz that can push and press the whole time.</v>

5576
02:27:10.841 --> 02:27:11.290
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

5577
02:27:11.290 --> 02:27:13.330
<v Speaker 6>see Ryan and that always gas up quick though.</v>

5578
02:27:13.331 --> 02:27:15.160
<v Speaker 6>Here's the thing he did in some fights,</v>

5579
02:27:15.370 --> 02:27:16.960
<v Speaker 6>but if you watch the Phil Davis fight,</v>

5580
02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:18.510
<v Speaker 6>he never gassed out for a second.</v>

5581
02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:19.180
<v Speaker 6>That fight.</v>

5582
02:27:19.180 --> 02:27:22.120
<v Speaker 6>People forget who like fucking filled Davis is good.</v>

5583
02:27:22.300 --> 02:27:25.210
<v Speaker 6>He's real good and Womble put it to him.</v>

5584
02:27:25.211 --> 02:27:29.860
<v Speaker 6>Phil Davis was in survival mode and the other guy about that survival mode son,</v>

5585
02:27:29.890 --> 02:27:30.723
<v Speaker 6>they'll gave it.</v>

5586
02:27:31.790 --> 02:27:32.623
<v Speaker 6>Yeah man,</v>

5587
02:27:32.770 --> 02:27:33.281
<v Speaker 6>he wasn't,</v>

5588
02:27:33.281 --> 02:27:35.470
<v Speaker 6>there was no wrestling to be done in that fight.</v>

5589
02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:37.240
<v Speaker 6>There's defense back to the feet,</v>

5590
02:27:37.241 --> 02:27:38.074
<v Speaker 6>keep ducking,</v>

5591
02:27:38.080 --> 02:27:40.270
<v Speaker 6>keep ducking because missiles are coming your way.</v>

5592
02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:43.570
<v Speaker 6>Or if he's with like Henri Hooft at that time was who've helped him that with</v>

5593
02:27:43.571 --> 02:27:44.470
<v Speaker 6>that for certain,</v>

5594
02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:44.831
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5595
02:27:44.831 --> 02:27:45.160
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

5596
02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:50.020
<v Speaker 6>but I really believe that all those tough training camps and tough fights and</v>

5597
02:27:50.021 --> 02:27:50.261
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5598
02:27:50.261 --> 02:27:53.590
<v Speaker 6>those battles that after a while he just didn't want to do it anymore.</v>

5599
02:27:53.620 --> 02:27:54.700
<v Speaker 6>Even if he's that good at it.</v>

5600
02:27:54.701 --> 02:27:55.990
<v Speaker 6>He was one comfortable,</v>

5601
02:27:55.991 --> 02:27:57.460
<v Speaker 6>stressed out all the time,</v>

5602
02:27:57.490 --> 02:27:58.900
<v Speaker 6>always get ready for a fight.</v>

5603
02:27:59.140 --> 02:27:59.891
<v Speaker 6>He didn't want to do it anymore.</v>

5604
02:27:59.891 --> 02:28:00.724
<v Speaker 6>He's a smart guy.</v>

5605
02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:01.450
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5606
02:28:01.450 --> 02:28:01.661
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5607
02:28:01.661 --> 02:28:04.450
<v Speaker 6>I think there's something admirable about that,</v>

5608
02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:07.600
<v Speaker 6>about him saying even though he's on top of the heap,</v>

5609
02:28:07.990 --> 02:28:08.201
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5610
02:28:08.201 --> 02:28:09.370
<v Speaker 6>just lost the title.</v>

5611
02:28:09.430 --> 02:28:09.970
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

5612
02:28:09.970 --> 02:28:10.420
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

5613
02:28:10.420 --> 02:28:11.111
<v Speaker 6>Decides.</v>

5614
02:28:11.111 --> 02:28:11.621
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>

5615
02:28:11.621 --> 02:28:12.430
<v Speaker 6>Fuck it.</v>

5616
02:28:12.430 --> 02:28:13.263
<v Speaker 6>I'm done.</v>

5617
02:28:13.330 --> 02:28:13.720
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5618
02:28:13.720 --> 02:28:14.720
<v Speaker 6>he got beat twice.</v>

5619
02:28:16.180 --> 02:28:17.030
<v Speaker 6>Maybe like you said,</v>

5620
02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:18.700
<v Speaker 6>maybe do more like twice in a row.</v>

5621
02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:19.593
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

5622
02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:20.201
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

5623
02:28:20.201 --> 02:28:22.220
<v Speaker 6>He one who did he beat in between?</v>

5624
02:28:22.221 --> 02:28:22.431
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

5625
02:28:22.431 --> 02:28:23.540
<v Speaker 6>he beat a couple people.</v>

5626
02:28:23.810 --> 02:28:24.920
<v Speaker 6>I think he beat Glover.</v>

5627
02:28:24.921 --> 02:28:26.540
<v Speaker 6>He docked out clover in between.</v>

5628
02:28:26.690 --> 02:28:27.523
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

5629
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:27.891
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

5630
02:28:27.891 --> 02:28:28.521
<v Speaker 6>and then,</v>

5631
02:28:28.521 --> 02:28:28.760
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5632
02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:29.390
<v Speaker 6>who else did he,</v>

5633
02:28:29.390 --> 02:28:30.650
<v Speaker 6>she was fucking terrifying.</v>

5634
02:28:30.700 --> 02:28:31.760
<v Speaker 6>It was tallyman.</v>

5635
02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:35.510
<v Speaker 6>But then he tried to make the lens of 70 he did make like 70 many times.</v>

5636
02:28:35.570 --> 02:28:39.860
<v Speaker 6>He used to fight at one 75 on tough at one 70 at that high level too,</v>

5637
02:28:39.861 --> 02:28:41.480
<v Speaker 6>when there's so much on the line,</v>

5638
02:28:41.481 --> 02:28:42.730
<v Speaker 6>you get a fight 10 weeks out.</v>

5639
02:28:42.740 --> 02:28:43.041
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

5640
02:28:43.041 --> 02:28:47.120
<v Speaker 6>Now every single day my thoughts are filled with what's going to happen in that</v>

5641
02:28:47.121 --> 02:28:52.121
<v Speaker 6>fight for 10 fucking weeks and it's exhausting knowing that I might make this</v>

5642
02:28:52.941 --> 02:28:54.860
<v Speaker 6>much money or I might make double that much.</v>

5643
02:28:54.920 --> 02:28:56.210
<v Speaker 6>I can't plan ahead at all.</v>

5644
02:28:56.240 --> 02:28:58.010
<v Speaker 6>You've got to go based on what happened in the fight.</v>

5645
02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:00.620
<v Speaker 6>I'm not a big believer in that.</v>

5646
02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:01.580
<v Speaker 6>I don't like that.</v>

5647
02:29:01.880 --> 02:29:05.300
<v Speaker 6>That's one part of the way people get paid that I wish wasn't a tradition.</v>

5648
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:07.400
<v Speaker 6>The fight and then when bonus,</v>

5649
02:29:07.430 --> 02:29:10.780
<v Speaker 6>I just feel like everybody's trying to win and then the decisions.</v>

5650
02:29:10.830 --> 02:29:11.060
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5651
02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:11.280
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5652
02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:13.220
<v Speaker 6>to see if it was one thing,</v>

5653
02:29:13.370 --> 02:29:18.370
<v Speaker 6>like if it was a rock solid decision process where we did it all in a computer</v>

5654
02:29:18.500 --> 02:29:21.290
<v Speaker 6>and everyone agreed and everyone voted online.</v>

5655
02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:21.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5656
02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:23.150
<v Speaker 6>Then okay.</v>

5657
02:29:23.270 --> 02:29:28.270
<v Speaker 6>Because it might cost you $50,000 if someone has a terrible idea of whether or</v>

5658
02:29:29.241 --> 02:29:33.170
<v Speaker 6>not you want to fight or not and sometimes sometimes they're close and sometimes</v>

5659
02:29:33.171 --> 02:29:35.960
<v Speaker 6>they're subjective and sometimes it's things that you might be looking for that</v>

5660
02:29:35.961 --> 02:29:38.990
<v Speaker 6>might be you might think isn't good enough to score and maybe you think the</v>

5661
02:29:38.991 --> 02:29:41.380
<v Speaker 6>defense is just as important because even though he took him down,</v>

5662
02:29:41.390 --> 02:29:44.360
<v Speaker 6>he didn't do anything and the guy on the bottom was always working off of his</v>

5663
02:29:44.361 --> 02:29:45.500
<v Speaker 6>back or you're a boxer,</v>

5664
02:29:45.501 --> 02:29:46.500
<v Speaker 6>I'm a Jujitsu guy.</v>

5665
02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:47.543
<v Speaker 6>Like yeah,</v>

5666
02:29:47.700 --> 02:29:47.990
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

5667
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:49.280
<v Speaker 6>there's always those things,</v>

5668
02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:51.890
<v Speaker 6>but I think those could be ironed out with a large,</v>

5669
02:29:52.040 --> 02:29:55.130
<v Speaker 6>large enough sample group or a large enough group of judges.</v>

5670
02:29:55.160 --> 02:29:55.993
<v Speaker 6>Like if we add,</v>

5671
02:29:56.360 --> 02:29:57.280
<v Speaker 6>why would you cage?</v>

5672
02:29:57.480 --> 02:29:58.370
<v Speaker 6>Why those three?</v>

5673
02:29:58.430 --> 02:29:58.851
<v Speaker 6>What do we need?</v>

5674
02:29:58.851 --> 02:29:59.684
<v Speaker 6>Three,</v>

5675
02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:00.171
<v Speaker 6>tell me.</v>

5676
02:30:00.171 --> 02:30:05.171
<v Speaker 6>There's not thousands of people listening to this right now that would make</v>

5677
02:30:05.901 --> 02:30:07.940
<v Speaker 6>phenomenal judges shit that,</v>

5678
02:30:07.941 --> 02:30:09.260
<v Speaker 6>no MMA,</v>

5679
02:30:09.261 --> 02:30:10.760
<v Speaker 6>that understand Jujitsu,</v>

5680
02:30:10.761 --> 02:30:13.070
<v Speaker 6>that no kickboxing all together.</v>

5681
02:30:13.400 --> 02:30:17.630
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's got to be a fucking shit ton of amount there that would do an</v>

5682
02:30:17.631 --> 02:30:19.940
<v Speaker 6>amazing job if you let them do it online.</v>

5683
02:30:20.330 --> 02:30:21.710
<v Speaker 6>Let him watch it online,</v>

5684
02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:23.080
<v Speaker 6>let them judge it online,</v>

5685
02:30:23.090 --> 02:30:24.710
<v Speaker 6>have a little camera on them while they do it.</v>

5686
02:30:24.711 --> 02:30:26.240
<v Speaker 6>So you know they're actually watching the fight.</v>

5687
02:30:26.540 --> 02:30:27.440
<v Speaker 6>Let them watch it.</v>

5688
02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:29.420
<v Speaker 6>Don't just no commentary.</v>

5689
02:30:29.421 --> 02:30:31.340
<v Speaker 6>Just to let you know at the sounds of the impacts,</v>

5690
02:30:31.520 --> 02:30:33.660
<v Speaker 6>how about let's get a bunch of people watching the show.</v>

5691
02:30:33.680 --> 02:30:35.690
<v Speaker 6>What would it take to like push an idea like that?</v>

5692
02:30:35.691 --> 02:30:40.691
<v Speaker 6>It's like we just used to Joe Louis versus Max Schmeling that judge and judge</v>

5693
02:30:42.580 --> 02:30:46.250
<v Speaker 6>Walkley and judge Judy's over and this job,</v>

5694
02:30:46.251 --> 02:30:49.040
<v Speaker 6>when we use this stupid old boxing system,</v>

5695
02:30:49.430 --> 02:30:51.410
<v Speaker 6>you know that system sucks.</v>

5696
02:30:51.410 --> 02:30:52.250
<v Speaker 6>A Fat Dick.</v>

5697
02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:56.510
<v Speaker 6>They need to have a gang of people judging fights because she'd be way more than</v>

5698
02:30:56.511 --> 02:31:00.680
<v Speaker 6>three and they should be super educated in terms of like high level</v>

5699
02:31:00.681 --> 02:31:03.440
<v Speaker 6>understanding of submission holds striking.</v>

5700
02:31:03.650 --> 02:31:04.910
<v Speaker 6>They should be able to demonstrate it.</v>

5701
02:31:04.911 --> 02:31:06.110
<v Speaker 6>What's more significant?</v>

5702
02:31:06.290 --> 02:31:09.980
<v Speaker 6>An elbow to the top of the head or a leg kick depends on who's throwing the</v>

5703
02:31:09.981 --> 02:31:10.311
<v Speaker 6>kick.</v>

5704
02:31:10.311 --> 02:31:11.090
<v Speaker 6>Depends on the stone,</v>

5705
02:31:11.090 --> 02:31:11.750
<v Speaker 6>the elbow,</v>

5706
02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:12.081
<v Speaker 6>what's,</v>

5707
02:31:12.081 --> 02:31:16.550
<v Speaker 6>what's better a take down or take down to lead you to get caught in a triangle</v>

5708
02:31:16.551 --> 02:31:18.050
<v Speaker 6>that you eventually survive in.</v>

5709
02:31:18.051 --> 02:31:20.670
<v Speaker 6>But you almost get tapped in and out.</v>

5710
02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:21.750
<v Speaker 6>Did it not count?</v>

5711
02:31:22.370 --> 02:31:25.680
<v Speaker 6>What if a guy gets you really close to a triangle and he's got you trapped in</v>

5712
02:31:25.681 --> 02:31:26.011
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>

5713
02:31:26.011 --> 02:31:26.890
<v Speaker 6>you try to slam on,</v>

5714
02:31:26.900 --> 02:31:29.910
<v Speaker 6>he tightens it up more and there's a battle and you're going back and forth and</v>

5715
02:31:29.911 --> 02:31:32.850
<v Speaker 6>back and forth and back and forth and finally you get out.</v>

5716
02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.430
<v Speaker 6>Do you get more credit because you took him down?</v>

5717
02:31:35.431 --> 02:31:37.290
<v Speaker 6>Then he gets for almost strangling you.</v>

5718
02:31:37.650 --> 02:31:39.270
<v Speaker 6>That's super subjective.</v>

5719
02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:41.880
<v Speaker 6>Super subjective and different people would disagree.</v>

5720
02:31:41.881 --> 02:31:42.810
<v Speaker 6>They will argue over it.</v>

5721
02:31:42.811 --> 02:31:47.811
<v Speaker 6>I've seen really high level referees and judges argue over what they think is</v>

5722
02:31:47.911 --> 02:31:48.810
<v Speaker 6>more important in better.</v>

5723
02:31:48.840 --> 02:31:51.180
<v Speaker 6>It's so subjective and it's crazy,</v>

5724
02:31:51.780 --> 02:31:53.370
<v Speaker 6>but I think if we had a giant number,</v>

5725
02:31:53.371 --> 02:31:53.671
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

5726
02:31:53.671 --> 02:31:54.570
<v Speaker 6>if we had a big number,</v>

5727
02:31:54.571 --> 02:31:56.160
<v Speaker 6>if you have a hundred people,</v>

5728
02:31:56.700 --> 02:31:58.190
<v Speaker 6>I'm getting crazy idea.</v>

5729
02:31:58.400 --> 02:32:03.400
<v Speaker 6>20 experts have a certified expert panel and you have these people.</v>

5730
02:32:04.591 --> 02:32:06.690
<v Speaker 6>You give them access to the fight for free.</v>

5731
02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:08.370
<v Speaker 6>You pay them a certain amount of money,</v>

5732
02:32:08.371 --> 02:32:09.660
<v Speaker 6>they get no commentary.</v>

5733
02:32:09.840 --> 02:32:12.450
<v Speaker 6>They listened to the fight play out in real time.</v>

5734
02:32:12.451 --> 02:32:16.290
<v Speaker 6>They have the options of tuning into each corner or individual corners if they</v>

5735
02:32:16.291 --> 02:32:16.621
<v Speaker 6>want.</v>

5736
02:32:16.621 --> 02:32:17.730
<v Speaker 6>It's easy to arrange.</v>

5737
02:32:17.820 --> 02:32:22.820
<v Speaker 6>We have that right now so if we decided to do that and give that to someone who</v>

5738
02:32:22.981 --> 02:32:27.981
<v Speaker 6>calls at home who wants to not just watch fights but is also an expert and would</v>

5739
02:32:28.411 --> 02:32:31.830
<v Speaker 6>love the idea of making 100 bucks or whatever the fuck they pay.</v>

5740
02:32:31.830 --> 02:32:36.830
<v Speaker 6>You have this camera prompt over their head have have a online contributors and</v>

5741
02:32:36.900 --> 02:32:37.260
<v Speaker 6>nice.</v>

5742
02:32:37.260 --> 02:32:41.250
<v Speaker 6>Yeah and and maybe you know maybe have fucking 10 people do it.</v>

5743
02:32:41.251 --> 02:32:42.330
<v Speaker 6>Maybe you have 20 people do it,</v>

5744
02:32:42.480 --> 02:32:47.480
<v Speaker 6>but it doesn't in this day and age like why would you not have more analysis</v>

5745
02:32:48.460 --> 02:32:49.293
<v Speaker 6>better than that.</v>

5746
02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:54.830
<v Speaker 6>It's just not a good idea to throw three unskilled people that their only</v>

5747
02:32:55.351 --> 02:32:57.390
<v Speaker 6>experiences watching fights and judging them.</v>

5748
02:32:57.600 --> 02:32:59.580
<v Speaker 6>Like literally they don't have any martial arts experience.</v>

5749
02:32:59.581 --> 02:33:00.900
<v Speaker 6>That's a common theme.</v>

5750
02:33:01.390 --> 02:33:01.930
<v Speaker 6>Like there's,</v>

5751
02:33:01.930 --> 02:33:04.350
<v Speaker 6>it's high level.</v>

5752
02:33:04.620 --> 02:33:06.990
<v Speaker 6>MMA fights are often,</v>

5753
02:33:06.991 --> 02:33:10.830
<v Speaker 6>the decisions are decided by people that have zero martial arts experience,</v>

5754
02:33:11.310 --> 02:33:12.540
<v Speaker 6>which is crazy.</v>

5755
02:33:13.020 --> 02:33:15.990
<v Speaker 6>It's like me judging a violin contest.</v>

5756
02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:17.381
<v Speaker 6>It really is like,</v>

5757
02:33:17.381 --> 02:33:19.530
<v Speaker 6>I don't know a goddamn thing about,</v>

5758
02:33:19.531 --> 02:33:20.850
<v Speaker 6>I could get it totally wrong.</v>

5759
02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:22.950
<v Speaker 6>I could get it totally wrong that people,</v>

5760
02:33:22.951 --> 02:33:23.491
<v Speaker 6>I would go,</v>

5761
02:33:23.491 --> 02:33:24.600
<v Speaker 6>oh I love the part we did that.</v>

5762
02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:25.650
<v Speaker 6>Like that was a mistake.</v>

5763
02:33:25.651 --> 02:33:28.500
<v Speaker 6>You fucking is not supposed to make that sound.</v>

5764
02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:30.350
<v Speaker 6>That's why he should lose.</v>

5765
02:33:30.351 --> 02:33:30.920
<v Speaker 6>I'm like all,</v>

5766
02:33:30.920 --> 02:33:31.860
<v Speaker 6>I thought that was cool.</v>

5767
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:32.833
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5768
02:33:32.910 --> 02:33:36.960
<v Speaker 6>That's how it is when a lot of these people literally don't have any idea what's</v>

5769
02:33:36.961 --> 02:33:37.794
<v Speaker 6>happening.</v>

5770
02:33:37.860 --> 02:33:40.830
<v Speaker 6>I have a friend who was a judge who told me wallow fight was going on.</v>

5771
02:33:40.831 --> 02:33:43.650
<v Speaker 6>This is many years ago while a fight was going on,</v>

5772
02:33:43.830 --> 02:33:47.250
<v Speaker 6>this guy was working for a Komora and this lady who's a judge goes,</v>

5773
02:33:47.670 --> 02:33:48.510
<v Speaker 6>what is he doing?</v>

5774
02:33:49.260 --> 02:33:50.010
<v Speaker 6>What is he doing?</v>

5775
02:33:50.010 --> 02:33:52.800
<v Speaker 6>She says it to him cause she needs to know cause she's,</v>

5776
02:33:52.801 --> 02:33:54.180
<v Speaker 6>she's watching the fight.</v>

5777
02:33:54.300 --> 02:33:55.980
<v Speaker 6>She doesn't know if that's a hold.</v>

5778
02:33:56.100 --> 02:33:56.761
<v Speaker 6>Like what is that?</v>

5779
02:33:56.761 --> 02:33:57.540
<v Speaker 6>Is this,</v>

5780
02:33:57.540 --> 02:33:58.410
<v Speaker 6>is this work?</v>

5781
02:33:58.470 --> 02:33:59.100
<v Speaker 6>Is this real?</v>

5782
02:33:59.100 --> 02:34:03.690
<v Speaker 6>And she's actually judging a fight and he said I was flabbergasted.</v>

5783
02:34:03.720 --> 02:34:04.553
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>

5784
02:34:04.620 --> 02:34:04.861
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

5785
02:34:04.861 --> 02:34:07.020
<v Speaker 6>she literally didn't understand what was happening.</v>

5786
02:34:07.110 --> 02:34:09.990
<v Speaker 6>She didn't know a Kamora of like super common,</v>

5787
02:34:10.170 --> 02:34:11.280
<v Speaker 6>super common move.</v>

5788
02:34:11.281 --> 02:34:12.114
<v Speaker 6>She didn't know it.</v>

5789
02:34:12.330 --> 02:34:12.900
<v Speaker 6>Death crazy.</v>

5790
02:34:12.900 --> 02:34:15.120
<v Speaker 6>Did you listen to the commentary at all in sugar spike?</v>

5791
02:34:16.230 --> 02:34:16.960
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>

5792
02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:17.793
<v Speaker 6>Oh fuck.</v>

5793
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Which fight?</v>

5794
02:34:18.580 --> 02:34:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Andre?</v>

5795
02:34:19.360 --> 02:34:21.760
<v Speaker 2>He was whining about meats and stuff.</v>

5796
02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:22.541
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5797
02:34:22.541 --> 02:34:23.470
<v Speaker 2>in between corners?</v>

5798
02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:24.131
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5799
02:34:24.131 --> 02:34:25.060
<v Speaker 2>it was during the fight.</v>

5800
02:34:25.061 --> 02:34:28.360
<v Speaker 2>I was just jabbering that Andre a little bit just cause I knew that that big</v>

5801
02:34:28.361 --> 02:34:33.361
<v Speaker 2>pressure moment he was feeling that I was just laughing when he missed or just</v>

5802
02:34:34.420 --> 02:34:36.130
<v Speaker 2>little things and make fun of them are a little bit,</v>

5803
02:34:36.131 --> 02:34:38.440
<v Speaker 2>cause I know he was thinking about it and I know that,</v>

5804
02:34:38.470 --> 02:34:39.460
<v Speaker 2>do you know him well?</v>

5805
02:34:39.490 --> 02:34:39.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5806
02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:42.190
<v Speaker 2>but I could see the pressure of the buildup of him all week.</v>

5807
02:34:42.191 --> 02:34:43.390
<v Speaker 2>He was getting super emotional,</v>

5808
02:34:43.391 --> 02:34:46.780
<v Speaker 2>so I knew that little extra push we'd get him emotional teamwork.</v>

5809
02:34:46.990 --> 02:34:48.790
<v Speaker 2>And then after he tweeted,</v>

5810
02:34:48.791 --> 02:34:49.624
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

5811
02:34:49.900 --> 02:34:52.780
<v Speaker 2>all I could hear is it's fucking corner talking shit to me the whole time.</v>

5812
02:34:52.781 --> 02:34:53.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's all I could like,</v>

5813
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:54.610
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

5814
02:34:54.610 --> 02:34:55.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

5815
02:34:55.330 --> 02:34:57.430
<v Speaker 2>I know at the high high level it's not going to work,</v>

5816
02:34:57.431 --> 02:34:59.290
<v Speaker 2>but I just feel it's another tactic.</v>

5817
02:34:59.980 --> 02:35:00.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5818
02:35:00.461 --> 02:35:00.910
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

5819
02:35:00.910 --> 02:35:02.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe it will like who would,</v>

5820
02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:03.580
<v Speaker 2>who would it work on?</v>

5821
02:35:03.910 --> 02:35:07.240
<v Speaker 2>We'll just say like these guys or these guys are UFC fighters and their town.</v>

5822
02:35:07.241 --> 02:35:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Everyone respects them and treats them nice.</v>

5823
02:35:09.250 --> 02:35:11.770
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden you're in this place where two guys are talking shit to</v>

5824
02:35:11.771 --> 02:35:14.290
<v Speaker 2>you and then you're fighting one and he's laughing at you in this and they're</v>

5825
02:35:14.291 --> 02:35:14.770
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

5826
02:35:14.770 --> 02:35:15.491
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck.</v>

5827
02:35:15.491 --> 02:35:16.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm not used to this.</v>

5828
02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:17.860
<v Speaker 2>It's just another tactic.</v>

5829
02:35:17.861 --> 02:35:19.900
<v Speaker 2>But I know at a certain level it won't work.</v>

5830
02:35:19.901 --> 02:35:20.734
<v Speaker 2>But why not?</v>

5831
02:35:22.060 --> 02:35:22.661
<v Speaker 2>Certain level?</v>

5832
02:35:22.661 --> 02:35:23.860
<v Speaker 2>It might work a little though.</v>

5833
02:35:24.310 --> 02:35:25.120
<v Speaker 2>It's just another.</v>

5834
02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5835
02:35:25.540 --> 02:35:29.230
<v Speaker 2>And I want people just want people fucking trying to hit sugar hearts and</v>

5836
02:35:29.231 --> 02:35:29.651
<v Speaker 2>they're stiff.</v>

5837
02:35:29.651 --> 02:35:31.120
<v Speaker 2>So he's waxing them as they come in.</v>

5838
02:35:31.860 --> 02:35:32.430
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5839
02:35:32.430 --> 02:35:34.020
<v Speaker 6>definitely don't talk about it on the Internet.</v>

5840
02:35:34.021 --> 02:35:36.120
<v Speaker 6>If you want it to have it still happen.</v>

5841
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:37.463
<v Speaker 6>It still happens.</v>

5842
02:35:37.860 --> 02:35:38.431
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure.</v>

5843
02:35:38.431 --> 02:35:39.540
<v Speaker 6>I'm just saying give it up.</v>

5844
02:35:39.541 --> 02:35:41.890
<v Speaker 6>Your strategy son believes in it though.</v>

5845
02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:42.780
<v Speaker 6>I trust it.</v>

5846
02:35:42.780 --> 02:35:43.830
<v Speaker 6>I believe you believe in it.</v>

5847
02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:46.620
<v Speaker 6>You definitely a fast learner man.</v>

5848
02:35:46.710 --> 02:35:47.370
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

5849
02:35:47.370 --> 02:35:48.240
<v Speaker 6>it's uh,</v>

5850
02:35:48.270 --> 02:35:50.240
<v Speaker 6>it's interesting how you have a,</v>

5851
02:35:50.241 --> 02:35:54.330
<v Speaker 6>a style of moving and throwing kicks that I would have assumed that you have</v>

5852
02:35:54.331 --> 02:35:59.331
<v Speaker 6>like a long background in some sort of traditional martial arts or karate or</v>

5853
02:36:00.630 --> 02:36:02.700
<v Speaker 6>taekwondo or something because the way you thrown kicks,</v>

5854
02:36:02.701 --> 02:36:04.340
<v Speaker 6>I was like the sky like the way,</v>

5855
02:36:04.410 --> 02:36:07.140
<v Speaker 6>but I guess that's like a lot of also your emulation of Connor,</v>

5856
02:36:07.141 --> 02:36:09.570
<v Speaker 6>right style.</v>

5857
02:36:09.910 --> 02:36:10.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5858
02:36:10.361 --> 02:36:10.840
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

5859
02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:12.220
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of doing that before,</v>

5860
02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:15.130
<v Speaker 2>before I saw Connor just kinda throwing weird kicks.</v>

5861
02:36:15.190 --> 02:36:18.910
<v Speaker 2>I remember being at the lab and watching videos and trying them,</v>

5862
02:36:18.940 --> 02:36:21.070
<v Speaker 2>just teaching myself then.</v>

5863
02:36:21.220 --> 02:36:24.700
<v Speaker 2>But as far as my movement that I played basketball,</v>

5864
02:36:24.701 --> 02:36:25.091
<v Speaker 2>football,</v>

5865
02:36:25.091 --> 02:36:29.230
<v Speaker 2>soccer and baseball my entire life since I was four until I was in high school,</v>

5866
02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:32.860
<v Speaker 2>I think I was just became a math super athletic from doing so many different</v>

5867
02:36:32.861 --> 02:36:33.694
<v Speaker 2>sports.</v>

5868
02:36:33.700 --> 02:36:35.650
<v Speaker 2>And then I added that to fighting and</v>

5869
02:36:37.270 --> 02:36:38.103
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

5870
02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:38.910
<v Speaker 2>It works well.</v>

5871
02:36:38.910 --> 02:36:39.060
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5872
02:36:39.060 --> 02:36:39.940
<v Speaker 6>your length too,</v>

5873
02:36:39.941 --> 02:36:40.181
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

5874
02:36:40.181 --> 02:36:41.410
<v Speaker 6>that's a big factor.</v>

5875
02:36:41.620 --> 02:36:43.570
<v Speaker 6>That's like a six four guy at one 70.</v>

5876
02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:44.920
<v Speaker 6>That's switching stances.</v>

5877
02:36:45.910 --> 02:36:50.910
<v Speaker 6>Five ten five 11 five 11 five 10 for one 35 is so crazy.</v>

5878
02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:52.220
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5879
02:36:52.220 --> 02:36:53.053
<v Speaker 6>there's some,</v>

5880
02:36:53.090 --> 02:36:53.360
<v Speaker 6>there's some,</v>

5881
02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:54.280
<v Speaker 6>as you walk around,</v>

5882
02:36:54.640 --> 02:36:57.370
<v Speaker 6>wait one 51 and put it in your arms real quick.</v>

5883
02:36:57.380 --> 02:37:01.720
<v Speaker 6>Like I fucking long his stretches for 30 for 35 like how hard is it for you to</v>

5884
02:37:01.721 --> 02:37:03.370
<v Speaker 6>get down to 35 super easy.</v>

5885
02:37:03.371 --> 02:37:03.881
<v Speaker 6>Super easy.</v>

5886
02:37:03.881 --> 02:37:04.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5887
02:37:04.300 --> 02:37:05.950
<v Speaker 6>What do you think about this recent move?</v>

5888
02:37:05.951 --> 02:37:09.040
<v Speaker 6>A Dana white has just said that he's going to eliminate the early weight cuts.</v>

5889
02:37:09.100 --> 02:37:09.530
<v Speaker 6>Is that really?</v>

5890
02:37:09.530 --> 02:37:11.440
<v Speaker 6>I hope that that would be the worst thing.</v>

5891
02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:13.820
<v Speaker 6>That's so stupid.</v>

5892
02:37:13.821 --> 02:37:16.190
<v Speaker 6>And you said too many people are missing the weight and they're trying to gain</v>

5893
02:37:16.191 --> 02:37:19.700
<v Speaker 6>the system and they're trying to cut more because they know that have more time</v>

5894
02:37:19.701 --> 02:37:20.534
<v Speaker 6>to recover.</v>

5895
02:37:20.810 --> 02:37:21.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

5896
02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:22.233
<v Speaker 6>I would a huge,</v>

5897
02:37:22.370 --> 02:37:23.150
<v Speaker 6>I love the,</v>

5898
02:37:23.150 --> 02:37:23.660
<v Speaker 6>the night.</v>

5899
02:37:23.660 --> 02:37:24.411
<v Speaker 6>It's easy.</v>

5900
02:37:24.411 --> 02:37:24.920
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>

5901
02:37:24.920 --> 02:37:26.720
<v Speaker 6>Fucking still know what time Wayne's are.</v>

5902
02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:31.430
<v Speaker 6>Do you think it's possible that they could ever eliminate weight cutting</v>

5903
02:37:31.431 --> 02:37:32.060
<v Speaker 6>entirely?</v>

5904
02:37:32.060 --> 02:37:32.810
<v Speaker 6>I hope so.</v>

5905
02:37:32.810 --> 02:37:33.643
<v Speaker 6>I would love that.</v>

5906
02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:34.970
<v Speaker 6>I would love that.</v>

5907
02:37:35.120 --> 02:37:35.630
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

5908
02:37:35.630 --> 02:37:36.220
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

5909
02:37:36.220 --> 02:37:36.440
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5910
02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:39.440
<v Speaker 6>find out what your actual weight is and fight it.</v>

5911
02:37:39.441 --> 02:37:39.980
<v Speaker 6>That,</v>

5912
02:37:39.980 --> 02:37:41.120
<v Speaker 6>I mean if you're too muscular,</v>

5913
02:37:41.121 --> 02:37:41.840
<v Speaker 6>loose weight,</v>

5914
02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:42.630
<v Speaker 6>if you're too fat,</v>

5915
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:43.463
<v Speaker 6>there's some fat,</v>

5916
02:37:44.090 --> 02:37:46.340
<v Speaker 6>but find out what weight you're at and just,</v>

5917
02:37:46.970 --> 02:37:49.230
<v Speaker 6>I think that's an unnecessary danger.</v>

5918
02:37:49.610 --> 02:37:50.750
<v Speaker 6>That's the Nice thing about Shaun.</v>

5919
02:37:50.751 --> 02:37:52.580
<v Speaker 6>He's not a huge one 35 or so weeks.</v>

5920
02:37:52.610 --> 02:37:56.510
<v Speaker 6>We don't have to eat to get huge like George said or eat to really dial it down.</v>

5921
02:37:56.511 --> 02:38:00.770
<v Speaker 6>We can eat to where he just performs the best and just stay there and then maybe</v>

5922
02:38:00.771 --> 02:38:01.970
<v Speaker 6>have to cut eight pounds,</v>

5923
02:38:02.480 --> 02:38:04.190
<v Speaker 6>eat normal the whole week,</v>

5924
02:38:04.250 --> 02:38:07.740
<v Speaker 6>drink normal the whole week and then go in there feeling 100% yeah,</v>

5925
02:38:07.741 --> 02:38:08.240
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>

5926
02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:10.400
<v Speaker 6>it's an unnecessary aspect.</v>

5927
02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:14.390
<v Speaker 6>And I think one of the things that would be a solution is give guys more options</v>

5928
02:38:14.391 --> 02:38:18.620
<v Speaker 6>of what weight to actually fight at when there's these big giant gaps in between</v>

5929
02:38:18.621 --> 02:38:19.460
<v Speaker 6>weight classes.</v>

5930
02:38:19.700 --> 02:38:22.280
<v Speaker 6>It forces people in a lot of ways to cut weight.</v>

5931
02:38:22.310 --> 02:38:26.450
<v Speaker 6>Cause like maybe they're just too small for one 85 but they can make one 70 so</v>

5932
02:38:26.451 --> 02:38:26.811
<v Speaker 6>fuck it.</v>

5933
02:38:26.811 --> 02:38:30.710
<v Speaker 6>I'll just make one 70 because I know how big x guy is or why guys.</v>

5934
02:38:30.750 --> 02:38:33.080
<v Speaker 6>Cause you know some of those 85 man,</v>

5935
02:38:33.081 --> 02:38:33.681
<v Speaker 6>you're around them.</v>

5936
02:38:33.681 --> 02:38:35.630
<v Speaker 6>You're like Ho Lee Shit.</v>

5937
02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:35.961
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>

5938
02:38:35.961 --> 02:38:37.310
<v Speaker 6>This is a fucking heavyweight.</v>

5939
02:38:37.311 --> 02:38:37.990

02:38:37.990 --> 02:38:40.250
<v Speaker 6>Geez Hales big fella.</v>

5941
02:38:40.850 --> 02:38:41.780
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of them.</v>

5942
02:38:41.781 --> 02:38:44.360
<v Speaker 6>Luke Rockhold is a big hazy fella.</v>

5943
02:38:44.450 --> 02:38:45.410
<v Speaker 6>He's big,</v>

5944
02:38:46.370 --> 02:38:48.800
<v Speaker 6>he's big and strong as fuck.</v>

5945
02:38:48.801 --> 02:38:53.801
<v Speaker 6>And you know he weighs one 85 so if you're in that guy's way class like good</v>

5946
02:38:54.021 --> 02:38:54.441

5950

5956
02:39:16.910 --> 02:39:18.350
<v Speaker 6>He doesn't look like a real person.</v>

5957
02:39:18.980 --> 02:39:21.230
<v Speaker 6>Have you been around him in real life to flex your traps?</v>

02:41:12.331 --> 02:41:15.270
<v Speaker 6>They had a marijuana leaf behind that at first and it was so sweet.</v>

6016
02:41:15.300 --> 02:41:16.350
<v Speaker 6>They had to get rid of the marijuana.</v>

6017
02:41:16.890 --> 02:41:17.723
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

6020
02:41:22.050 --> 02:41:22.650
<v Speaker 6>It was a rest.</v>

6021
02:41:22.650 --> 02:41:26.280
<v Speaker 6>They weren't willing to think of how many people told you not promote marijuana</v>

<v Speaker 6>but not anymore.</v>

6025
02:41:32.430 --> 02:41:33.450
<v Speaker 6>Like couple of years ago,</v>

6026

02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:41.761
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

6034
02:41:41.761 --> 02:41:42.300
<v Speaker 6>that's true.</v>

6035
02:41:42.300 --> 02:41:43.133
<v Speaker 6>Open as fuck.</v>

6036
02:41:44.550 --> 02:41:45.870
<v Speaker 6>People are open about weed.</v>

6037
02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:47.820
<v Speaker 6>It's more behind the scenes.</v>

6038
02:41:47.821 --> 02:41:49.080
<v Speaker 6>Well Dana doesn't give a fuck.</v>

6039
02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:52.320
<v Speaker 6>The only thing that they care about is commissions and people you know,</v>

6040
02:41:52.321 --> 02:41:53.490
<v Speaker 6>failing the test,</v>

6041
02:41:53.491 --> 02:41:54.930
<v Speaker 6>which they think it's stupid in the first place,</v>

6042
02:41:55.330 --> 02:41:56.250
<v Speaker 6>then it doesn't give a fuck.</v>

6043
02:41:56.251 --> 02:41:56.911
<v Speaker 6>People smoke weed.</v>

6044
02:41:56.911 --> 02:41:57.421
<v Speaker 6>If there were like there,</v>

6045
02:41:57.421 --> 02:41:57.751
<v Speaker 6>he's right.</v>

6046
02:41:57.751 --> 02:41:59.070
<v Speaker 6>He'd rather have him smoke weed.</v>

6047
02:41:59.071 --> 02:41:59.850
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure.</v>

6048
02:41:59.850 --> 02:42:01.980
<v Speaker 6>Especially now that it's legal then drink.</v>

6049
02:42:02.100 --> 02:42:02.933
<v Speaker 6>But 10 years ago,</v>

6050
02:42:03.130 --> 02:42:04.560
<v Speaker 6>what was he like five years ago?</v>

6051
02:42:04.590 --> 02:42:06.120
<v Speaker 6>It's all about the commissions.</v>

6052
02:42:06.121 --> 02:42:06.841
<v Speaker 6>He's a promoter.</v>

6053
02:42:06.841 --> 02:42:10.200
<v Speaker 6>He's not a guy who interferes with people's Personal Pottsville cause he doesn't</v>

6054
02:42:10.201 --> 02:42:10.441
<v Speaker 6>like it.</v>

6055
02:42:10.441 --> 02:42:12.180
<v Speaker 6>Same moral in my company we're gonna.</v>

6056
02:42:12.270 --> 02:42:12.870
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

6057
02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:13.630
<v Speaker 6>none of that.</v>

6058
02:42:13.630 --> 02:42:14.190
<v Speaker 6>He just,</v>

6059
02:42:14.190 --> 02:42:17.310
<v Speaker 6>his opinion is based entirely on the fact you're going to get tested.</v>

6060
02:42:17.940 --> 02:42:19.590
<v Speaker 6>So if you're smoking pot,</v>

6061
02:42:19.591 --> 02:42:23.940
<v Speaker 6>you can't stop and you're six weeks out and you know you fucking pass that limit</v>

6062
02:42:23.941 --> 02:42:27.420
<v Speaker 6>because there used to be pleased to be looking for a very small amount and you</v>

6063
02:42:27.421 --> 02:42:27.610
<v Speaker 6>would,</v>

6064
02:42:27.610 --> 02:42:30.270
<v Speaker 6>you would need a good solid four to six weeks to flush your system.</v>

6065
02:42:30.510 --> 02:42:32.370
<v Speaker 6>And some guys would j they push it,</v>

6066
02:42:32.371 --> 02:42:33.204
<v Speaker 6>they get into three,</v>

6067
02:42:33.210 --> 02:42:36.690
<v Speaker 6>they get into three weeks and just drink a lot of fucking water and apple cider</v>

6068
02:42:36.691 --> 02:42:39.990
<v Speaker 6>vinegar and tried to clean their system out and sometimes it would work and</v>

6069
02:42:39.991 --> 02:42:42.990
<v Speaker 6>sometimes you would deal with a really sophisticated commission and they would</v>

6070
02:42:42.991 --> 02:42:43.530
<v Speaker 6>catch you.</v>

6071
02:42:43.530 --> 02:42:44.101

<v Speaker 6>And it was just a little amount.</v>

6083

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6085

<v Speaker 6>And so he's probably sore all the time,</v>

6092
02:43:10.771 --> 02:43:11.210
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

6093

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6109
02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:33.760
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be ridiculous.</v>

6110
02:43:34.210 --> 02:43:36.670
<v Speaker 6>We're going to look back on the fact that pot was illegal when we're kids,</v>

6111
02:43:36.710 --> 02:43:37.331
<v Speaker 6>we're going to be like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Some people take it to their graves though.</v>

<v Speaker 6>they just don't get it.</v>

6116
02:43:45.950 --> 02:43:46.350
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

6117
02:43:46.350 --> 02:43:47.410

6181
02:45:11.301 --> 02:45:11.710
<v Speaker 6>Those like,</v>

6182
02:45:11.710 --> 02:45:15.970
<v Speaker 6>that's like the marijuana equivalent of those people that take that Krokodil</v>

6183
02:45:15.971 --> 02:45:16.804
<v Speaker 6>drug.</v>

6184
02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:19.600
<v Speaker 6>You know those people that take that shit,</v>

6185
02:45:19.601 --> 02:45:20.160
<v Speaker 6>that rots.</v>

6186
02:45:20.160 --> 02:45:24.760
<v Speaker 6>You ever seen that Krokodil with some drug that was in fact affecting a lot of</v>

6187
02:45:24.761 --> 02:45:25.571
<v Speaker 6>people apparently.</v>

6188
02:45:25.571 --> 02:45:26.404
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

6189
02:45:26.890 --> 02:45:29.320
<v Speaker 6>was it eastern bloc states?</v>

02:45:30.300 --> 02:45:31.133
<v Speaker 6>Russia?</v>

6191
02:45:31.750 --> 02:45:32.583
<v Speaker 6>I think it was Russia,</v>

6192
02:45:33.070 --> 02:45:37.510
<v Speaker 6>but it rots your skin away to the point where your bones exposed.</v>

6193
02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:41.590
<v Speaker 6>Since people would shoot it right into the spot where they're bone was exposed.</v>

6194
02:45:41.980 --> 02:45:43.510
<v Speaker 6>Like that's how crazy this drug.</v>

6195
02:45:43.511 --> 02:45:44.650
<v Speaker 6>If it's so,</v>

6196
02:45:44.860 --> 02:45:47.710
<v Speaker 6>it's so powerful and so crazy and feel so good,</v>

6197
02:45:47.860 --> 02:45:49.990
<v Speaker 6>they shoot it right into the rotten meat.</v>

6198
02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:52.210
<v Speaker 6>What would their exposed bone,</v>

6199
02:45:52.540 --> 02:45:52.661
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>this photo's man all over the Internet.</v>

6201
02:45:54.281 --> 02:45:56.280

6202
02:45:56.750 --> 02:45:57.700

6208
02:46:02.890 --> 02:46:06.610
<v Speaker 6>I feel like there was a theme about Russian kids that were shooting Krokodil and</v>

6209
02:46:06.611 --> 02:46:08.170
<v Speaker 6>this burnt out warehouse.</v>

<v Speaker 5>you're willing to shoot the drugs.</v>

6264
02:47:19.571 --> 02:47:21.860
<v Speaker 5>She's into the hole where the bone is.</v>

6265
02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:23.393
<v Speaker 5>Fuck,</v>

6266
02:47:24.520 --> 02:47:25.430
<v Speaker 5>people are fucked up,</v>

6267
02:47:25.431 --> 02:47:26.030
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

6268
02:47:26.030 --> 02:47:28.370
<v Speaker 5>People are fucked up and a lot of it's this weird,</v>

6269
02:47:28.371 --> 02:47:29.750
<v Speaker 5>like they were saying in this,</v>

6270
02:47:29.751 --> 02:47:29.990
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6271
02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:31.430
<v Speaker 5>podcast from zero to three.</v>

6272
02:47:31.431 --> 02:47:33.650
<v Speaker 5>You learn more than you'll ever learn in your whole life.</v>

6273
02:47:33.700 --> 02:47:35.360
<v Speaker 5>And we don't even remember that.</v>

6274
02:47:35.361 --> 02:47:36.230
<v Speaker 5>Like when people say that,</v>

6275
02:47:36.231 --> 02:47:36.441
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

6276
02:47:36.441 --> 02:47:37.274
<v Speaker 5>maybe you bro.</v>

6277
02:47:37.940 --> 02:47:38.773
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>

6278
02:47:39.350 --> 02:47:43.130
<v Speaker 5>I thought pattern like 10 times stronger than heroin.</v>

6279
02:47:44.150 --> 02:47:45.440
<v Speaker 5>Three times more toxic.</v>

6280
02:47:45.680 --> 02:47:46.513
<v Speaker 5>Jesus.</v>

6281
02:47:47.300 --> 02:47:49.220
<v Speaker 5>It's a 10th of the price.</v>

6282
02:47:49.350 --> 02:47:49.970
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

6283
02:47:49.970 --> 02:47:50.510
<v Speaker 5>that's the problem.</v>

6284
02:47:50.510 --> 02:47:51.080
<v Speaker 5>It's a bar.</v>

6285
02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:51.913
<v Speaker 5>It's Costco.</v>

6286
02:47:52.100 --> 02:47:52.933
<v Speaker 5>Costco drug.</v>

6287
02:47:53.150 --> 02:47:56.300
<v Speaker 5>So what were we're saying that you learn more by the time you're three zero from</v>

6288
02:47:56.301 --> 02:47:57.380
<v Speaker 5>zero to three,</v>

6289
02:47:57.470 --> 02:48:00.770
<v Speaker 5>then you'll ever learn in your life taking in more information about like</v>

6290
02:48:01.290 --> 02:48:02.123
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

6291
02:48:02.520 --> 02:48:03.050
<v Speaker 5>Huh?</v>

6292
02:48:03.050 --> 02:48:04.660
<v Speaker 5>Just being programmed from that like,</v>

6293
02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:06.290
<v Speaker 5>and we don't even remember that.</v>

6294
02:48:06.291 --> 02:48:08.690
<v Speaker 5>And that forms maybe a lot of patterns that are brains now.</v>

6295
02:48:08.691 --> 02:48:09.140
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

6296
02:48:09.140 --> 02:48:09.351
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

6297
02:48:09.351 --> 02:48:10.051
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

6298
02:48:10.051 --> 02:48:10.880
<v Speaker 5>Idea.</v>

6299
02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:11.031
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

6300
02:48:11.031 --> 02:48:11.864
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>

6301
02:48:12.130 --> 02:48:12.540
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

6302
02:48:12.540 --> 02:48:15.170
<v Speaker 5>especially if a kids grow around,</v>

6303
02:48:15.380 --> 02:48:16.580
<v Speaker 5>grew up around violence,</v>

6304
02:48:16.940 --> 02:48:17.960
<v Speaker 5>violence in the house,</v>

6305
02:48:17.990 --> 02:48:19.100
<v Speaker 5>violence in their community.</v>

6306
02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:19.880
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

6307
02:48:19.880 --> 02:48:22.400
<v Speaker 5>especially even if their mom was going through violence,</v>

6308
02:48:22.401 --> 02:48:23.330
<v Speaker 5>whether in the womb,</v>

6309
02:48:23.360 --> 02:48:23.721
<v Speaker 5>that's it,</v>

6310
02:48:23.721 --> 02:48:27.200
<v Speaker 5>that has a giant factor in the way you connect the dots and the way you interact</v>

6311
02:48:27.201 --> 02:48:28.034
<v Speaker 5>with people.</v>

6312
02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:32.780
<v Speaker 5>I was on a plane once headed to Australia and Michael Irvin was on the plane</v>

6313
02:48:32.781 --> 02:48:33.800
<v Speaker 5>just by random,</v>

6314
02:48:33.890 --> 02:48:34.221
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6315
02:48:34.221 --> 02:48:35.090
<v Speaker 5>it's a long ass flights,</v>

6316
02:48:35.091 --> 02:48:35.924
<v Speaker 5>like 14 hours.</v>

6317
02:48:36.320 --> 02:48:38.540
<v Speaker 5>So me and him got to talk and super good dude,</v>

6318
02:48:38.541 --> 02:48:39.860
<v Speaker 5>like real nice guy.</v>

6319
02:48:39.861 --> 02:48:41.870
<v Speaker 5>I mean phenomenal football player,</v>

6320
02:48:41.871 --> 02:48:43.640
<v Speaker 5>but just like you would never know it talking to him,</v>

6321
02:48:43.670 --> 02:48:44.330
<v Speaker 5>just super,</v>

6322
02:48:44.330 --> 02:48:45.320
<v Speaker 5>super down to earth.</v>

6323
02:48:46.010 --> 02:48:47.210
<v Speaker 5>But he was talking about um,</v>

6324
02:48:47.211 --> 02:48:48.470
<v Speaker 5>work he does with kids,</v>

6325
02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:49.393
<v Speaker 5>with um,</v>

6326
02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:51.890
<v Speaker 5>kids that and trying to sort of,</v>

6327
02:48:51.930 --> 02:48:52.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

6328
02:48:52.290 --> 02:48:53.960
<v Speaker 5>aluminate to people.</v>

6329
02:48:54.530 --> 02:48:59.270
<v Speaker 5>What happens to someone who grows up in a terrible community where they</v>

6330
02:48:59.271 --> 02:49:03.230
<v Speaker 5>experience a lot of violence in the neighborhood or their family experiences,</v>

6331
02:49:03.231 --> 02:49:07.010
<v Speaker 5>violence or that the mother does while the boys in the womb that this</v>

6332
02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:09.960
<v Speaker 6>literally their behavior patterns,</v>

6333
02:49:10.020 --> 02:49:10.853
<v Speaker 6>thought pattern,</v>

6334
02:49:11.190 --> 02:49:12.210
<v Speaker 6>they come out of that,</v>

6335
02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:14.790
<v Speaker 6>they come out of the gate with a faster fuse,</v>

6336
02:49:14.791 --> 02:49:15.750
<v Speaker 6>a shorter fuse,</v>

6337
02:49:15.930 --> 02:49:16.021
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6338
02:49:16.021 --> 02:49:16.441
<v Speaker 6>more,</v>

6339
02:49:16.441 --> 02:49:18.180
<v Speaker 6>more inclinations towards violence.</v>

6340
02:49:18.510 --> 02:49:19.080
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

6341
02:49:19.080 --> 02:49:20.400
<v Speaker 6>different hormone rates.</v>

6342
02:49:20.430 --> 02:49:22.800
<v Speaker 6>Either their body reacts to stress differently,</v>

6343
02:49:22.910 --> 02:49:23.940
<v Speaker 6>they're quicker to snap,</v>

6344
02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:25.980
<v Speaker 6>the quicker to make impulsive,</v>

6345
02:49:26.010 --> 02:49:28.680
<v Speaker 6>violent judgments and beat people up and shit.</v>

6346
02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:32.730
<v Speaker 6>Like a lot of the people that are in these situations,</v>

6347
02:49:32.731 --> 02:49:36.210
<v Speaker 6>like what you're dealing with is like a programming from the time they're in the</v>

6348
02:49:36.211 --> 02:49:38.250
<v Speaker 6>womb and it's very difficult to correct.</v>

6349
02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:42.450
<v Speaker 6>And then we have to like really not think about it in terms of like here's a</v>

6350
02:49:42.451 --> 02:49:45.930
<v Speaker 6>person who's doing a bad thing and think about it more in terms of like,</v>

6351
02:49:45.931 --> 02:49:46.590
<v Speaker 6>well wait a minute,</v>

6352
02:49:46.590 --> 02:49:47.880
<v Speaker 6>why is he so angry?</v>

6353
02:49:47.910 --> 02:49:49.230
<v Speaker 6>How did he get like this?</v>

6354
02:49:49.231 --> 02:49:49.651
<v Speaker 6>What,</v>

6355
02:49:49.651 --> 02:49:50.484
<v Speaker 6>what happened?</v>

6356
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:54.570
<v Speaker 6>Like we can just get out of let it happen over and over again and keep blaming</v>

6357
02:49:54.571 --> 02:49:56.070
<v Speaker 6>people who get it wrong and say,</v>

6358
02:49:56.071 --> 02:49:56.281
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

6359
02:49:56.281 --> 02:49:58.980
<v Speaker 6>everybody figured out because we're going to keep locking you up or,</v>

6360
02:49:59.040 --> 02:50:00.090
<v Speaker 6>or should they look at it and go,</v>

6361
02:50:00.091 --> 02:50:01.050
<v Speaker 6>how is this happening?</v>

6362
02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:02.700
<v Speaker 6>What is causing people?</v>

6363
02:50:02.701 --> 02:50:03.420
<v Speaker 6>Hey look,</v>

6364
02:50:03.420 --> 02:50:06.180
<v Speaker 6>Mike grew up on the south side of Chicago.</v>

6365
02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:09.810
<v Speaker 6>Everyone in his neighborhood was getting beat up and shot and you know,</v>

6366
02:50:09.811 --> 02:50:11.370
<v Speaker 6>if someone says something to him,</v>

6367
02:50:11.371 --> 02:50:12.061
<v Speaker 6>he can't even help.</v>

6368
02:50:12.061 --> 02:50:15.600
<v Speaker 6>But he just sucker punches you cause he's on edge all the fucking time.</v>

6369
02:50:15.870 --> 02:50:17.250
<v Speaker 6>Are we supposed to treat him the same way?</v>

6370
02:50:17.251 --> 02:50:21.540
<v Speaker 6>We're going to treat Chad who grows up in the country club and the where's izod</v>

6371
02:50:21.541 --> 02:50:22.500
<v Speaker 6>shirts and his,</v>

6372
02:50:22.770 --> 02:50:25.650
<v Speaker 6>his parents are both on Xanax and everybody's cool and the maid raised him.</v>

6373
02:50:25.830 --> 02:50:26.071
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

6374
02:50:26.071 --> 02:50:26.640
<v Speaker 6>go get a tree.</v>

6375
02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:27.320
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

6376
02:50:27.320 --> 02:50:28.590
<v Speaker 6>they're not the same people.</v>

6377
02:50:28.620 --> 02:50:32.190
<v Speaker 6>These are not the same kind of human beings like some human beings.</v>

6378
02:50:32.670 --> 02:50:33.870
<v Speaker 6>They got a shitty deal.</v>

6379
02:50:33.930 --> 02:50:34.860
<v Speaker 6>They got a shit deal,</v>

6380
02:50:34.861 --> 02:50:35.071
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

6381
02:50:35.071 --> 02:50:36.750
<v Speaker 6>Does she get a shit deal coming into this planet?</v>

6382
02:50:36.780 --> 02:50:41.780
<v Speaker 6>We've got to figure out how to stop those shit deals from taking place so often</v>

6383
02:50:41.910 --> 02:50:45.330
<v Speaker 6>figure out a way to like make it nicer for people.</v>

6384
02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:50.280
<v Speaker 6>Like the worst problems are people that come out of horrible situations in their</v>

6385
02:50:50.281 --> 02:50:54.120
<v Speaker 6>life when they're young and then go on to do violence and terrible things when</v>

6386
02:50:54.121 --> 02:50:54.660
<v Speaker 6>they get older.</v>

6387
02:50:54.660 --> 02:50:54.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6388
02:50:54.960 --> 02:50:58.230
<v Speaker 6>If you could just get to them that early fuck,</v>

6389
02:50:58.520 --> 02:50:58.890
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

6390
02:50:58.890 --> 02:51:01.170
<v Speaker 6>everybody calm down,</v>

6391
02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:02.220
<v Speaker 6>everybody relax.</v>

6392
02:51:02.220 --> 02:51:06.930
<v Speaker 6>Like let's figure out a way to get you all paths to success and get you to</v>

6393
02:51:06.931 --> 02:51:11.931
<v Speaker 6>figure out like coaching and life coaching and education and counseling and</v>

6394
02:51:14.251 --> 02:51:18.330
<v Speaker 6>community and you're wanted and loved and everyone's together and you have a</v>

6395
02:51:18.331 --> 02:51:20.040
<v Speaker 6>stake in this game just as much as everybody else.</v>

6396
02:51:20.070 --> 02:51:20.260
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6397
02:51:20.260 --> 02:51:22.620
<v Speaker 6>And then it have this kid with kids when they're young,</v>

6398
02:51:22.770 --> 02:51:27.630
<v Speaker 6>you'll develop phenomenal human beings instead of people that are likely to grow</v>

6399
02:51:27.631 --> 02:51:28.860
<v Speaker 6>up and you know,</v>

6400
02:51:28.950 --> 02:51:32.100
<v Speaker 6>engage in the kind of patterns that they saw all their life.</v>

6401
02:51:32.210 --> 02:51:32.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6402
02:51:32.481 --> 02:51:35.600
<v Speaker 3>I think like a big bet going our school system,</v>

6403
02:51:35.601 --> 02:51:37.370
<v Speaker 3>like we're not taught how to use our brains.</v>

6404
02:51:37.371 --> 02:51:40.130
<v Speaker 3>We're not taught how to deal with certain emotions when they arise.</v>

6405
02:51:40.190 --> 02:51:41.420
<v Speaker 3>We're just taught math,</v>

6406
02:51:41.421 --> 02:51:41.690
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>

6407
02:51:41.690 --> 02:51:42.523
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff.</v>

6408
02:51:42.860 --> 02:51:43.910
<v Speaker 3>I think the school system,</v>

6409
02:51:43.911 --> 02:51:48.470
<v Speaker 3>we need to implement more teaching us how to meditate and a control,</v>

6410
02:51:48.471 --> 02:51:49.304
<v Speaker 3>our thoughts,</v>

6411
02:51:49.900 --> 02:51:50.660
<v Speaker 3>our emotions.</v>

6412
02:51:50.660 --> 02:51:54.920
<v Speaker 3>Just like Rhonda Patrick says like what the mom's eating has so much to do with</v>

6413
02:51:54.921 --> 02:51:58.010
<v Speaker 3>how that baby's formed and how healthy it's foreign for sure.</v>

6414
02:51:58.540 --> 02:51:58.950
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

6415
02:51:58.950 --> 02:51:59.680
<v Speaker 6>Small extent.</v>

6416
02:51:59.680 --> 02:52:00.200
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6417
02:52:00.200 --> 02:52:00.531
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

6418
02:52:00.531 --> 02:52:01.364
<v Speaker 6>it's all,</v>

6419
02:52:01.370 --> 02:52:03.680
<v Speaker 6>there's so many factors and then,</v>

6420
02:52:03.681 --> 02:52:04.514
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6421
02:52:04.550 --> 02:52:06.400
<v Speaker 6>there's things</v>

6422
02:52:06.400 --> 02:52:09.130
<v Speaker 4>that you're just never gonna be able to control like where you're born,</v>

6423
02:52:09.131 --> 02:52:09.371
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

6424
02:52:09.371 --> 02:52:09.850
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

6425
02:52:09.850 --> 02:52:11.110
<v Speaker 4>who your parents are,</v>

6426
02:52:11.380 --> 02:52:12.880
<v Speaker 4>what part of the world do you live on?</v>

6427
02:52:12.881 --> 02:52:14.410
<v Speaker 4>And we were all lucky as shit,</v>

6428
02:52:14.411 --> 02:52:18.520
<v Speaker 4>even the poorest of us to be here in America where you could be in a shitty</v>

6429
02:52:18.521 --> 02:52:21.010
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood and managed to get out and,</v>

6430
02:52:21.450 --> 02:52:22.181
<v Speaker 4>and become,</v>

6431
02:52:22.181 --> 02:52:22.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6432
02:52:22.510 --> 02:52:26.050
<v Speaker 4>at least a financial success is places where that's just not possible.</v>

6433
02:52:26.200 --> 02:52:27.033
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6434
02:52:27.160 --> 02:52:30.190
<v Speaker 4>literally how lucky are we that we're not living in fucking Singapore where they</v>

6435
02:52:30.191 --> 02:52:33.640
<v Speaker 4>could just pull you over and just lock you in a cage for a year because you</v>

6436
02:52:33.641 --> 02:52:34.750
<v Speaker 4>liked to smoke plants.</v>

6437
02:52:35.790 --> 02:52:36.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6438
02:52:36.280 --> 02:52:37.110
<v Speaker 4>No Shit.</v>

6439
02:52:37.110 --> 02:52:38.440
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking insane shit.</v>

6440
02:52:39.550 --> 02:52:39.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6441
02:52:39.910 --> 02:52:40.743
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

6442
02:52:40.750 --> 02:52:42.070
<v Speaker 4>we're all insanely lucky.</v>

6443
02:52:42.220 --> 02:52:44.590
<v Speaker 4>I bet it's pretty crazy being a dad.</v>

6444
02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:45.960
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

6445
02:52:45.960 --> 02:52:46.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm bet.</v>

6446
02:52:46.480 --> 02:52:46.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6447
02:52:46.930 --> 02:52:47.740
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

6448
02:52:47.740 --> 02:52:50.230
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to wrap your head around it until you experience it.</v>

6449
02:52:50.410 --> 02:52:51.010
<v Speaker 4>I bet.</v>

6450
02:52:51.010 --> 02:52:51.460
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

6451
02:52:51.460 --> 02:52:52.900
<v Speaker 4>it is a very,</v>

6452
02:52:52.901 --> 02:52:53.800
<v Speaker 4>very rewarding,</v>

6453
02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:55.400
<v Speaker 4>but it's also very strange,</v>

6454
02:52:55.420 --> 02:53:00.280
<v Speaker 4>very humbling changes your whole perspective on things you like.</v>

6455
02:53:00.281 --> 02:53:03.310
<v Speaker 4>You love these little people in a way that you didn't even know you could love</v>

6456
02:53:04.200 --> 02:53:05.033
<v Speaker 4>and it's,</v>

6457
02:53:05.050 --> 02:53:05.980
<v Speaker 4>you just feel different.</v>

6458
02:53:06.010 --> 02:53:07.060
<v Speaker 4>You feel different about people.</v>

6459
02:53:07.090 --> 02:53:08.110
<v Speaker 4>I look at people now,</v>

6460
02:53:08.140 --> 02:53:08.441
<v Speaker 4>men,</v>

6461
02:53:08.441 --> 02:53:08.890
<v Speaker 4>women,</v>

6462
02:53:08.890 --> 02:53:09.723
<v Speaker 4>everybody.</v>

6463
02:53:10.150 --> 02:53:11.650
<v Speaker 4>I look at them like they used to be a baby.</v>

6464
02:53:12.760 --> 02:53:15.280
<v Speaker 4>That started to happen almost immediately after I had a kid.</v>

6465
02:53:15.281 --> 02:53:16.960
<v Speaker 4>Like I never used to think about it that way.</v>

6466
02:53:17.170 --> 02:53:20.620
<v Speaker 4>If I saw some dude and he was fucking like 70 years old yelling at people,</v>

6467
02:53:20.621 --> 02:53:21.221
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>

6468
02:53:21.221 --> 02:53:22.900
<v Speaker 4>get off my lawn or whatever,</v>

6469
02:53:22.901 --> 02:53:23.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6470
02:53:23.440 --> 02:53:23.831
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>

6471
02:53:23.831 --> 02:53:24.790
<v Speaker 4>look at that old dickhead.</v>

6472
02:53:24.850 --> 02:53:25.683
<v Speaker 4>I'll beat your ass.</v>

6473
02:53:25.690 --> 02:53:28.240
<v Speaker 4>I just think he's an old dick and fuck that little dickhead.</v>

6474
02:53:28.540 --> 02:53:29.920
<v Speaker 4>But now I go,</v>

6475
02:53:29.980 --> 02:53:30.101
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

6476
02:53:30.101 --> 02:53:32.230
<v Speaker 4>that was a baby man.</v>

6477
02:53:32.260 --> 02:53:35.050
<v Speaker 4>That was a baby that just went through life.</v>

6478
02:53:35.080 --> 02:53:37.000
<v Speaker 4>And then got to the point where it's this,</v>

6479
02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:38.740
<v Speaker 4>this old man who just,</v>

6480
02:53:39.310 --> 02:53:40.143
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6481
02:53:40.720 --> 02:53:45.720
<v Speaker 4>everybody could ride that fucking mechanical bull for a second or two and seven</v>

6482
02:53:46.241 --> 02:53:47.320
<v Speaker 4>years old and you're like,</v>

6483
02:53:47.321 --> 02:53:51.580
<v Speaker 4>get off my line and you just can't wait to go back inside and drink yourself to</v>

6484
02:53:51.581 --> 02:53:53.320
<v Speaker 4>death and you're watching judge Judy.</v>

6488
02:53:57.521 --> 02:54:02.050
<v Speaker 4>Those people that are out there just in a room with the fucking walls are yellow</v>

6489
02:54:02.051 --> 02:54:02.950
<v Speaker 4>with cigarettes.</v>

6490
02:54:03.660 --> 02:54:05.160
<v Speaker 4>Just constantly smoking.</v>

6491

6498
02:54:25.061 --> 02:54:27.550
<v Speaker 4>They take with them the little too that goes up their nose.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6503
02:54:31.481 --> 02:54:32.590

6544
02:55:31.901 --> 02:55:34.730
<v Speaker 6>It's one of the things that he wanted to talk about when he knew he was going to</v>

6545
02:55:34.731 --> 02:55:35.630
<v Speaker 6>be fighting for the title.</v>

6546
02:55:36.140 --> 02:55:36.771
<v Speaker 6>Basically,</v>

6547
02:55:36.771 --> 02:55:36.981
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6548
02:55:36.981 --> 02:55:37.790
<v Speaker 6>in his,</v>

02:55:37.790 --> 02:55:38.180
<v Speaker 6>he had,</v>

6550
02:55:38.180 --> 02:55:39.420
<v Speaker 6>he's not the best at English.</v>

6551
02:55:39.421 --> 02:55:40.101
<v Speaker 6>She's still learning it.</v>

6552
02:55:40.101 --> 02:55:40.641
<v Speaker 6>But he was like,</v>

6553
02:55:40.641 --> 02:55:41.060
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6554
02:55:41.060 --> 02:55:43.010
<v Speaker 6>I just want to say fuck slavery like this.</v>

6555
02:55:43.011 --> 02:55:47.570
<v Speaker 6>This is crazy that this is happening today in 2018 they have slavery and Libya.</v>

6556
02:55:48.090 --> 02:55:51.980
<v Speaker 6>They ha they were shipped people or cell phone camera footage of the slave</v>

6557
02:55:51.981 --> 02:55:52.191
<v Speaker 6>auction.</v>

6558
02:55:52.191 --> 02:55:53.024
<v Speaker 6>It's going on.</v>

6559
02:55:53.450 --> 02:55:53.991
<v Speaker 6>Damn,</v>

6560
02:55:53.991 --> 02:55:54.390
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

6561
02:55:54.390 --> 02:55:55.720
<v Speaker 6>that's fucked up.</v>

6562
02:55:55.790 --> 02:55:56.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

6563
02:55:56.030 --> 02:55:56.863
<v Speaker 6>that could be us.</v>

6564
02:55:56.950 --> 02:55:57.260
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

6565
02:55:57.260 --> 02:55:58.093
<v Speaker 6>we can be born there.</v>

6566
02:55:58.100 --> 02:55:58.281
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

6567
02:55:58.281 --> 02:55:59.114
<v Speaker 6>we got lucky.</v>

6568
02:55:59.150 --> 02:56:01.400
<v Speaker 6>Everyone got lucky and some got lucky than others.</v>

6569
02:56:01.970 --> 02:56:02.990
<v Speaker 6>But the,</v>

6570
02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:06.170
<v Speaker 6>the lack of just,</v>

6571
02:56:06.740 --> 02:56:08.600
<v Speaker 6>not just an understanding of that,</v>

6572
02:56:08.870 --> 02:56:10.250
<v Speaker 6>but the action,</v>

6573
02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:12.620
<v Speaker 6>like the fact that we always think we have to do all these different things in</v>

6574
02:56:12.621 --> 02:56:13.430
<v Speaker 6>other countries.</v>

6575
02:56:13.430 --> 02:56:13.671
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

6576
02:56:13.671 --> 02:56:16.070
<v Speaker 6>we have to go over there and help these people out there trade.</v>

6577
02:56:16.100 --> 02:56:16.251
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

6578
02:56:16.251 --> 02:56:18.680
<v Speaker 6>we have to go over here and there's a steel embargo.</v>

6579
02:56:18.681 --> 02:56:19.610
<v Speaker 6>We need to talk to these people.</v>

6580
02:56:19.770 --> 02:56:19.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

6581
02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:20.360
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

6582
02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:21.710
<v Speaker 6>We were sure we definitely do.</v>

6583
02:56:21.740 --> 02:56:21.951
<v Speaker 6>But what,</v>

6584
02:56:21.951 --> 02:56:22.101
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6585
02:56:22.101 --> 02:56:23.030
<v Speaker 6>we really need to do.</v>

6586
02:56:23.090 --> 02:56:25.280
<v Speaker 6>We need to fix up these fucking poor cities.</v>

6587
02:56:25.640 --> 02:56:26.450
<v Speaker 6>Fixed this up.</v>

6588
02:56:26.450 --> 02:56:28.130
<v Speaker 6>You had a horrible poverty.</v>

6589
02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:32.120
<v Speaker 6>You've got places where you have block after block with boarded up windows and</v>

6590
02:56:32.121 --> 02:56:32.421
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6591
02:56:32.421 --> 02:56:33.410
<v Speaker 6>this is exists,</v>

6592
02:56:33.411 --> 02:56:33.740
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

6593
02:56:33.740 --> 02:56:34.730
<v Speaker 6>The reservations.</v>

6594
02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:35.540
<v Speaker 6>Oh Dude.</v>

6595
02:56:35.540 --> 02:56:36.060
<v Speaker 6>Ah,</v>

6596
02:56:36.060 --> 02:56:37.100
<v Speaker 6>that's a different world.</v>

6597
02:56:37.101 --> 02:56:38.300
<v Speaker 6>They're two different worlds.</v>

6598
02:56:38.330 --> 02:56:39.163
<v Speaker 6>It really is.</v>

6599
02:56:39.200 --> 02:56:39.740
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6600
02:56:39.740 --> 02:56:43.700
<v Speaker 6>But it's like that's never something that's discussed when people talk about the</v>

6601
02:56:43.701 --> 02:56:46.640
<v Speaker 6>problems that this country faces there they live roughly,</v>

6602
02:56:46.720 --> 02:56:47.090
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6603
02:56:47.090 --> 02:56:49.460
<v Speaker 6>economic crisis and they use words like,</v>

6604
02:56:49.820 --> 02:56:50.271
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6605
02:56:50.271 --> 02:56:50.580
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

6606
02:56:50.580 --> 02:56:50.771
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6607
02:56:50.771 --> 02:56:53.360
<v Speaker 6>welfare and a quality or you know,</v>

6608
02:56:54.740 --> 02:56:55.100
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

6609
02:56:55.100 --> 02:56:56.120
<v Speaker 6>income inequality,</v>

6610
02:56:56.121 --> 02:56:57.230
<v Speaker 6>the use these terms.</v>

6611
02:56:57.410 --> 02:56:58.550
<v Speaker 6>But at the end of the day,</v>

6612
02:56:58.551 --> 02:56:59.211
<v Speaker 6>we don't think about,</v>

6613
02:56:59.211 --> 02:56:59.361
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

6614
02:56:59.361 --> 02:57:00.800
<v Speaker 6>it's just like people that are fucked,</v>

6615
02:57:01.130 --> 02:57:01.940
<v Speaker 6>they're fucked.</v>

6616
02:57:01.940 --> 02:57:02.391
<v Speaker 6>Like their,</v>

6617
02:57:02.391 --> 02:57:03.710
<v Speaker 6>their situation is fucked.</v>

6618
02:57:03.711 --> 02:57:07.820
<v Speaker 6>It's not good and they don't get the same break is someone who lives in a nice</v>

6619
02:57:07.821 --> 02:57:08.810
<v Speaker 6>neighborhood in Columbus,</v>

6620
02:57:08.811 --> 02:57:09.230
<v Speaker 6>Ohio.</v>

6621
02:57:09.230 --> 02:57:10.310
<v Speaker 6>They're not getting the same break.</v>

6622
02:57:10.820 --> 02:57:11.960
<v Speaker 6>It's a different situation.</v>

6623
02:57:12.170 --> 02:57:13.070
<v Speaker 6>And until you fix that,</v>

6624
02:57:13.071 --> 02:57:15.530
<v Speaker 6>you're going to make criminals and angry people.</v>

6625
02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:17.780
<v Speaker 6>And pay people that are dysfunctional and people that are,</v>

6626
02:57:17.781 --> 02:57:17.961
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6627
02:57:17.961 --> 02:57:21.920
<v Speaker 6>they're lashing out because they experienced violence and no love their entire</v>

6628
02:57:21.921 --> 02:57:22.220
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>

6629
02:57:22.220 --> 02:57:23.180
<v Speaker 6>You can always get that,</v>

6630
02:57:23.181 --> 02:57:23.780
<v Speaker 6>Matt,</v>

6631
02:57:23.780 --> 02:57:25.190
<v Speaker 6>and this is what I was talking about earlier,</v>

6632
02:57:25.191 --> 02:57:29.690
<v Speaker 6>that our technology is constantly and rapidly accelerating,</v>

6633
02:57:29.930 --> 02:57:34.190
<v Speaker 6>but our understanding of our interactions with each other is still fucked up.</v>

6634
02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:38.570
<v Speaker 6>It's still clunky and not well thought through.</v>

6635
02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:43.700
<v Speaker 6>And as much as we know about so many different factors in terms of like how</v>

6636
02:57:43.701 --> 02:57:44.750
<v Speaker 6>human beings develop,</v>

6637
02:57:44.751 --> 02:57:47.210
<v Speaker 6>we put almost no effort into fixing it.</v>

6638
02:57:47.270 --> 02:57:47.421
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

6639
02:57:47.421 --> 02:57:47.961
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

6640
02:57:47.961 --> 02:57:48.860
<v Speaker 6>What would help?</v>

6641
02:57:49.400 --> 02:57:54.400
<v Speaker 6>They would have to go on an all out campaign to reinvigorate horrible</v>

6642
02:57:54.981 --> 02:57:55.814
<v Speaker 6>neighborhoods.</v>

6643
02:57:56.060 --> 02:57:56.990
<v Speaker 6>They would have to fix,</v>

6644
02:57:57.020 --> 02:58:02.020
<v Speaker 6>they would have to use government money to fix these houses and fix these</v>

6645
02:58:02.101 --> 02:58:03.240
<v Speaker 6>neighborhoods and make,</v>

6646
02:58:03.390 --> 02:58:05.970
<v Speaker 6>make it safer with more police force.</v>

6647
02:58:06.270 --> 02:58:06.631
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

6648
02:58:06.631 --> 02:58:09.610
<v Speaker 6>make community centers where people can go and be safe,</v>

6649
02:58:09.611 --> 02:58:12.090
<v Speaker 6>set it up so they can do activities there that they would like.</v>

6650
02:58:12.570 --> 02:58:12.871
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

6651
02:58:12.871 --> 02:58:13.141
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

6652
02:58:13.141 --> 02:58:18.141
<v Speaker 6>there's gotta be ways that you can invigorate these places and you somehow or</v>

6653
02:58:18.421 --> 02:58:20.550
<v Speaker 6>another figure out a way to get work for a lot of these people.</v>

6654
02:58:20.730 --> 02:58:21.870
<v Speaker 6>Give them counseling,</v>

6655
02:58:21.900 --> 02:58:22.530
<v Speaker 6>give them,</v>

6656
02:58:22.530 --> 02:58:22.821
<v Speaker 6>let,</v>

6657
02:58:22.821 --> 02:58:23.491
<v Speaker 6>let people know that.</v>

6658
02:58:23.491 --> 02:58:26.310
<v Speaker 6>And I've never really been to school and they're in their fucking twenties</v>

6659
02:58:26.311 --> 02:58:27.180
<v Speaker 6>there's a place we can go,</v>

6660
02:58:27.181 --> 02:58:28.710
<v Speaker 6>we can teach you how to write and read.</v>

6661
02:58:28.900 --> 02:58:29.733
<v Speaker 6>This is real.</v>

6662
02:58:29.940 --> 02:58:32.430
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of people that are like this and in the real world,</v>

6663
02:58:34.140 --> 02:58:34.381
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6664
02:58:34.381 --> 02:58:35.214
<v Speaker 6>we can,</v>

6665
02:58:35.940 --> 02:58:39.210
<v Speaker 6>we can fix things if we put money and time into them.</v>

6666
02:58:39.330 --> 02:58:40.440
<v Speaker 6>Like the way they decided,</v>

6667
02:58:40.441 --> 02:58:44.190
<v Speaker 6>like they were using Halbert and to go and rebuild places that we blew up in</v>

6668
02:58:44.191 --> 02:58:45.024
<v Speaker 6>Iraq.</v>

6669
02:58:45.180 --> 02:58:46.110
<v Speaker 6>Like that's what they do.</v>

6670
02:58:46.111 --> 02:58:48.510
<v Speaker 6>They go and re fix stuff that we fucking,</v>

6671
02:58:49.080 --> 02:58:49.860
<v Speaker 6>they build,</v>

6672
02:58:49.860 --> 02:58:51.330
<v Speaker 6>they build shit that we fuck up.</v>

6673
02:58:51.360 --> 02:58:51.541
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

6674
02:58:51.541 --> 02:58:54.810
<v Speaker 6>they go over and then they put power plants and do all kinds of other shit over</v>

6675
02:58:54.811 --> 02:58:54.991
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

6676
02:58:54.991 --> 02:58:57.480
<v Speaker 6>But they had to get these giant contracts to go over there and do that.</v>

6677
02:58:57.810 --> 02:58:58.643
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

6678
02:58:58.710 --> 02:59:01.110
<v Speaker 6>Well we definitely blew things up so we should definitely fix it.</v>

6679
02:59:01.111 --> 02:59:02.760
<v Speaker 6>But shouldn't we fix Chicago too?</v>

6680
02:59:03.170 --> 02:59:06.570
<v Speaker 6>What are you going to gang violence constantly in Chicago.</v>

6681
02:59:07.230 --> 02:59:09.600
<v Speaker 6>Death rate in Chicago is crazy.</v>

6682
02:59:09.601 --> 02:59:10.110
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

6683
02:59:10.110 --> 02:59:12.430
<v Speaker 6>Or Detroit or you know,</v>

6684
02:59:12.570 --> 02:59:13.381
<v Speaker 6>fill in the blank,</v>

6685
02:59:13.381 --> 02:59:17.250
<v Speaker 6>whatever bad neighborhood it's experiencing some sort of a drug conflict.</v>

6686
02:59:17.370 --> 02:59:18.300
<v Speaker 6>Reservations.</v>

6687
02:59:18.540 --> 02:59:18.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6688
02:59:18.960 --> 02:59:21.930
<v Speaker 6>And then how about the fact collectively we all need to look at the fact that</v>

6689
02:59:21.931 --> 02:59:26.430
<v Speaker 6>there's Mexico's right next to us and the only reason why they have such violent</v>

6690
02:59:26.431 --> 02:59:26.821
<v Speaker 6>crimes,</v>

6691
02:59:26.821 --> 02:59:29.370
<v Speaker 6>cause we lack drugs and we keep those drugs illegal.</v>

6692
02:59:29.400 --> 02:59:30.720
<v Speaker 6>So bad guy sell drugs.</v>

6693
02:59:30.721 --> 02:59:32.730
<v Speaker 6>Like this is fucking stupid shit ever.</v>

6694
02:59:33.160 --> 02:59:33.841
<v Speaker 6>It's like you don't,</v>

6695
02:59:33.841 --> 02:59:34.710
<v Speaker 6>you know it.</v>

6696
02:59:34.711 --> 02:59:35.760
<v Speaker 6>Everybody knows it.</v>

6697
02:59:35.761 --> 02:59:36.450
<v Speaker 6>This isn't,</v>

6698
02:59:36.450 --> 02:59:37.770
<v Speaker 6>I'm not a smart guy.</v>

6699
02:59:37.920 --> 02:59:39.000
<v Speaker 6>Like if I know it,</v>

6700
02:59:39.001 --> 02:59:39.480
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>

6701
02:59:39.480 --> 02:59:40.440
<v Speaker 6>I'm no genius.</v>

6702
02:59:40.680 --> 02:59:42.540
<v Speaker 6>If I know the solution.</v>

6703
02:59:42.870 --> 02:59:46.410
<v Speaker 6>You don't think the people in the highest levels of government know the</v>

6704
02:59:46.411 --> 02:59:46.860
<v Speaker 6>solution.</v>

6705
02:59:46.860 --> 02:59:47.221
<v Speaker 6>But Dude,</v>

6706
02:59:47.221 --> 02:59:50.670
<v Speaker 6>you're a lot smarter than you think because think of the people you talk to</v>

6707
02:59:50.770 --> 02:59:51.600
<v Speaker 6>everyday,</v>

6708
02:59:51.600 --> 02:59:55.410
<v Speaker 6>deep conversations as you guys are a lot of knowledge that people have never.</v>

6709
02:59:55.440 --> 02:59:55.531
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6710
02:59:55.531 --> 02:59:59.790
<v Speaker 6>But see that's the difference between knowledge that you just sort of remember</v>

6711
02:59:59.791 --> 03:00:01.170
<v Speaker 6>things that people have told you,</v>

6712
03:00:01.470 --> 03:00:04.260
<v Speaker 6>which I got some of that and actually have an an education in it.</v>

6713
03:00:04.500 --> 03:00:05.370
<v Speaker 6>That's the difference.</v>

6714
03:00:05.490 --> 03:00:07.230
<v Speaker 6>Like if people ask me about martial arts,</v>

6715
03:00:07.600 --> 03:00:11.930
<v Speaker 6>I can understand almost everything you want to talk about with martial arts,</v>

6716
03:00:12.090 --> 03:00:14.250
<v Speaker 6>with the exception of some judo and some wrestling,</v>

6717
03:00:14.550 --> 03:00:14.791
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6718
03:00:14.791 --> 03:00:15.780
<v Speaker 6>some judo and some wrestling.</v>

6719
03:00:15.781 --> 03:00:18.500
<v Speaker 6>I would want to talk to an expert in what makes sure that I got my positions,</v>

6720
03:00:18.530 --> 03:00:18.980
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

6721
03:00:18.980 --> 03:00:22.080
<v Speaker 6>my understanding of what the best thing to do.</v>

6722
03:00:22.350 --> 03:00:25.230
<v Speaker 6>But everything else I'm going to sacred in Michael Poland said though,</v>

6723
03:00:25.260 --> 03:00:26.580
<v Speaker 6>how long on sleep,</v>

6724
03:00:26.610 --> 03:00:27.930
<v Speaker 6>how long do doctors get?</v>

6725
03:00:27.930 --> 03:00:30.300
<v Speaker 6>Like how long is their courses on sleep one course.</v>

6726
03:00:30.330 --> 03:00:33.630
<v Speaker 6>How long exactly listened to them or do you listen to your podcast?</v>

6727
03:00:33.660 --> 03:00:33.871
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

6728
03:00:33.871 --> 03:00:35.460
<v Speaker 6>but I don't listen to them when it comes to sleep.</v>

6729
03:00:35.461 --> 03:00:38.070
<v Speaker 6>I listen to a guy like Matthew Walker who's asleep expert.</v>

6730
03:00:38.071 --> 03:00:38.510
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6731
03:00:38.510 --> 03:00:38.941
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

6732
03:00:38.941 --> 03:00:39.774
<v Speaker 6>There are those.</v>

6733
03:00:39.840 --> 03:00:41.070
<v Speaker 6>He's a real,</v>

6734
03:00:41.100 --> 03:00:44.520
<v Speaker 6>he's a real sleep expert so he's the guy that I should listen to but just</v>

6735
03:00:44.521 --> 03:00:47.130
<v Speaker 6>because I can pair it what he says don't get confused.</v>

6736
03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:48.450
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm not smart.</v>

6737
03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:49.830
<v Speaker 6>I just remember shit.</v>

6738
03:00:50.250 --> 03:00:51.540
<v Speaker 6>But that's in a way,</v>

6739
03:00:51.541 --> 03:00:53.970
<v Speaker 6>that's smart dude.</v>

6740
03:00:53.971 --> 03:00:56.610
<v Speaker 6>If you could see how my fucking brain actually functions,</v>

6741
03:00:57.060 --> 03:01:00.340
<v Speaker 6>how I write material and why I need to constantly keep moving and you'd be like,</v>

6742
03:01:00.370 --> 03:01:00.551
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

6743
03:01:00.551 --> 03:01:01.384
<v Speaker 6>you're just crazy.</v>

6744
03:01:01.390 --> 03:01:02.223
<v Speaker 6>You're not smart.</v>

6745
03:01:02.530 --> 03:01:04.040
<v Speaker 6>You just a crazy nice person.</v>

6746
03:01:04.770 --> 03:01:05.560
<v Speaker 6>That's what it is.</v>

6747
03:01:05.560 --> 03:01:07.900
<v Speaker 6>Open minded to definitely open minded.</v>

6748
03:01:07.960 --> 03:01:09.040
<v Speaker 6>I think I need to be,</v>

6749
03:01:09.041 --> 03:01:10.000
<v Speaker 6>and I think we all need to be,</v>

6750
03:01:10.030 --> 03:01:12.460
<v Speaker 6>I think it's one of our main problems as people,</v>

6751
03:01:12.520 --> 03:01:15.130
<v Speaker 6>and I've been absolutely guilty of this in the past,</v>

6752
03:01:15.460 --> 03:01:19.680
<v Speaker 6>is that we cling to an idea as if it's our identity.</v>

6753
03:01:19.810 --> 03:01:20.643
<v Speaker 6>I'll give it as it,</v>

6754
03:01:20.650 --> 03:01:22.900
<v Speaker 6>if it defines us instead of looking like,</v>

6755
03:01:22.901 --> 03:01:23.620
<v Speaker 6>am I right?</v>

6756
03:01:23.620 --> 03:01:24.453
<v Speaker 6>I might not be right.</v>

6757
03:01:24.700 --> 03:01:26.230
<v Speaker 6>Like there's a lot of power in saying,</v>

6758
03:01:26.290 --> 03:01:26.621
<v Speaker 6>damn,</v>

6759
03:01:26.621 --> 03:01:27.430
<v Speaker 6>I'm wrong.</v>

6760
03:01:27.430 --> 03:01:28.570
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of power in that.</v>

6761
03:01:28.600 --> 03:01:30.640
<v Speaker 6>There really is and we need to recognize that.</v>

6762
03:01:30.850 --> 03:01:34.420
<v Speaker 6>We need to recognize like there's power in saying you're sorry this power and</v>

6763
03:01:34.421 --> 03:01:34.571
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

6764
03:01:34.571 --> 03:01:34.760
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

6765
03:01:34.760 --> 03:01:34.950
<v Speaker 6>I've,</v>

6766
03:01:34.950 --> 03:01:36.010
<v Speaker 6>I definitely fucked up.</v>

6767
03:01:36.190 --> 03:01:36.521
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>

6768
03:01:36.521 --> 03:01:37.960
<v Speaker 6>I was in the wrong 100%.</v>

6769
03:01:38.020 --> 03:01:38.853
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

6770
03:01:39.100 --> 03:01:39.791
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what I did.</v>

6771
03:01:39.791 --> 03:01:40.480
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry.</v>

6772
03:01:40.480 --> 03:01:41.040
<v Speaker 6>You know it,</v>

6773
03:01:41.040 --> 03:01:41.201
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

6774
03:01:41.201 --> 03:01:42.130
<v Speaker 6>there's power in that.</v>

6775
03:01:42.190 --> 03:01:42.641
<v Speaker 6>He's Poe.</v>

6776
03:01:42.641 --> 03:01:43.750
<v Speaker 6>I feel bad about it.</v>

6777
03:01:43.930 --> 03:01:45.220
<v Speaker 6>There's power in saying,</v>

6778
03:01:45.221 --> 03:01:45.670
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6779
03:01:45.670 --> 03:01:48.550
<v Speaker 6>I thought this was correct and it wasn't.</v>

6780
03:01:48.640 --> 03:01:49.690
<v Speaker 6>I really feel stupid.</v>

6781
03:01:49.930 --> 03:01:50.260
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

6782
03:01:50.260 --> 03:01:50.640
<v Speaker 6>sorry.</v>

6783
03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:51.071
<v Speaker 6>Argued.</v>

6784
03:01:51.071 --> 03:01:51.760
<v Speaker 6>That's so hard.</v>

6785
03:01:51.760 --> 03:01:52.750
<v Speaker 6>I really thought I was right.</v>

6786
03:01:52.751 --> 03:01:53.620
<v Speaker 6>I'm fucking idiot.</v>

6787
03:01:53.830 --> 03:01:57.240
<v Speaker 6>You gotta be willing to do that if people were less willing to do that.</v>

6788
03:01:57.250 --> 03:01:58.120
<v Speaker 6>It's like there's some people,</v>

6789
03:01:58.121 --> 03:02:02.140
<v Speaker 6>they say something and they stick with it and then they'll fucking die on that</v>

6790
03:02:02.141 --> 03:02:02.710
<v Speaker 6>hill.</v>

6791
03:02:02.710 --> 03:02:03.170
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

6792
03:02:03.170 --> 03:02:06.930
<v Speaker 6>Like this is why it was so weird that Donald Trump was trying to say that the</v>

6793
03:02:06.940 --> 03:02:08.780
<v Speaker 6>eagles never stood for the Superbowl.</v>

6794
03:02:09.110 --> 03:02:10.800
<v Speaker 6>There were the kneeling and the,</v>

6795
03:02:10.810 --> 03:02:11.643
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6796
03:02:11.670 --> 03:02:13.000
<v Speaker 6>enough of them didn't want to come.</v>

6797
03:02:13.001 --> 03:02:15.860
<v Speaker 6>So I'm canceling this party uninvited him.</v>

6798
03:02:17.350 --> 03:02:18.250
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

6799
03:02:18.251 --> 03:02:19.720
<v Speaker 6>And that's why it's crazy.</v>

6800
03:02:19.750 --> 03:02:21.280
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy because of the way we,</v>

6801
03:02:21.310 --> 03:02:22.150
<v Speaker 6>we really,</v>

6802
03:02:22.151 --> 03:02:26.830
<v Speaker 6>in our heart of hearts and understand how people are capable of communicating</v>

6803
03:02:26.831 --> 03:02:27.664
<v Speaker 6>with each other.</v>

6804
03:02:28.120 --> 03:02:28.391
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6805
03:02:28.391 --> 03:02:29.410
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty cool.</v>

6806
03:02:29.620 --> 03:02:29.861
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6807
03:02:29.861 --> 03:02:31.570
<v Speaker 6>We're capable of being way better than this.</v>

6808
03:02:31.571 --> 03:02:35.230
<v Speaker 6>We just clumsy or just stumbling into each other and head butting each other and</v>

6809
03:02:35.231 --> 03:02:37.790
<v Speaker 6>shit like a mosh pit and he goes,</v>

6810
03:02:37.850 --> 03:02:38.890
<v Speaker 6>you're just fighting each other.</v>

6811
03:02:38.910 --> 03:02:39.671
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of that,</v>

6812
03:02:39.671 --> 03:02:40.420
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

6813
03:02:40.420 --> 03:02:41.141
<v Speaker 6>It's a lot of everybody,</v>

6814
03:02:41.141 --> 03:02:41.861
<v Speaker 6>including me,</v>

6815
03:02:41.861 --> 03:02:44.410
<v Speaker 6>I've done it to everybody wanting their side to be right.</v>

6816
03:02:44.600 --> 03:02:45.370
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

6817
03:02:45.370 --> 03:02:46.690
<v Speaker 6>Just get so stupid with it.</v>

6818
03:02:46.810 --> 03:02:50.230
<v Speaker 6>That's why it's hard to like wander out up out of your group of friends.</v>

6819
03:02:50.350 --> 03:02:51.130
<v Speaker 6>Fuck yeah.</v>

6820
03:02:51.130 --> 03:02:51.821
<v Speaker 6>He got like,</v>

6821
03:02:51.821 --> 03:02:52.930
<v Speaker 6>Fuck Eh.</v>

6822
03:02:53.020 --> 03:02:53.950
<v Speaker 6>Try to trust people.</v>

6823
03:02:53.951 --> 03:02:54.460
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

6824
03:02:54.460 --> 03:02:57.850
<v Speaker 6>Try to find people that aren't like secretly hoping you fail.</v>

6825
03:02:57.910 --> 03:02:58.743
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6826
03:02:58.940 --> 03:02:59.650
<v Speaker 6>A lot of that,</v>

6827
03:02:59.650 --> 03:03:00.461
<v Speaker 6>those people are exhausted.</v>

6828
03:03:00.461 --> 03:03:01.240
<v Speaker 6>Similar mindset.</v>

6829
03:03:01.240 --> 03:03:03.680
<v Speaker 6>It's constantly sharing different articles you find in that,</v>

6830
03:03:03.690 --> 03:03:04.523
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

6831
03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:07.150
<v Speaker 6>pretty lucky and being honest about what you know.</v>

6832

<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

6833
03:03:07.870 --> 03:03:09.220
<v Speaker 6>don't pretend to know more than you know.</v>

6834
03:03:09.870 --> 03:03:10.560
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

6835
03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:12.070
<v Speaker 6>going to be aware of what you know.</v>

6836
03:03:12.100 --> 03:03:12.970
<v Speaker 6>Like someone like you.</v>

6837
03:03:12.971 --> 03:03:14.440
<v Speaker 6>Like I could listen to an expert,</v>

6838
03:03:14.441 --> 03:03:15.071
<v Speaker 6>nutritionists,</v>

6839
03:03:15.071 --> 03:03:16.160
<v Speaker 6>they kind of overweight.</v>

6840
03:03:16.161 --> 03:03:16.691
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't look good.</v>

6841
03:03:16.691 --> 03:03:18.970
<v Speaker 6>Or someone like you who's not an expert nutritionist,</v>

6842
03:03:18.971 --> 03:03:19.870
<v Speaker 6>but look at your body.</v>

6843
03:03:19.900 --> 03:03:21.910
<v Speaker 6>You have a lot of fucking knowledge that you learned.</v>

6844
03:03:22.060 --> 03:03:22.241
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

6845
03:03:22.241 --> 03:03:23.380
<v Speaker 6>but definitely don't listen to me.</v>

6846
03:03:23.410 --> 03:03:28.120
<v Speaker 6>Only listened to if I can pair it somebody else's shit or tell you to go listen</v>

6847
03:03:28.121 --> 03:03:29.950
<v Speaker 6>to their shit because I get things wrong.</v>

6848
03:03:30.060 --> 03:03:30.241
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

6849
03:03:30.241 --> 03:03:30.790
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

6850
03:03:30.790 --> 03:03:34.270
<v Speaker 6>I'm not educated in the mechanisms of nutrient absorption.</v>

6851
03:03:34.271 --> 03:03:36.610
<v Speaker 6>So there's like things that if you take it with certain things,</v>

6852
03:03:36.611 --> 03:03:37.930
<v Speaker 6>it's not good for you.</v>

6853
03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:39.760
<v Speaker 6>Nutritionist will know all that stuff.</v>

6854
03:03:39.761 --> 03:03:40.061
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>

6855
03:03:40.061 --> 03:03:40.661
<v Speaker 6>the person knows.</v>

6856
03:03:40.661 --> 03:03:45.340
<v Speaker 6>I know some things like don't have saturated fat with refined carbohydrates and</v>

6857
03:03:45.341 --> 03:03:45.681
<v Speaker 6>sugar.</v>

6858
03:03:45.681 --> 03:03:46.600
<v Speaker 6>It's not a good combination.</v>

6859
03:03:46.601 --> 03:03:47.860
<v Speaker 6>Especially if you have certain genes.</v>

6860
03:03:48.010 --> 03:03:48.940
<v Speaker 6>I know a bunch of shit.</v>

6861
03:03:48.941 --> 03:03:50.590
<v Speaker 6>I know what you're supposed to eat and not supposed to eat.</v>

6862
03:03:50.591 --> 03:03:51.940
<v Speaker 6>But some nutritionists though,</v>

6863
03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.100
<v Speaker 6>even some like at the EOC Pie,</v>

6864
03:03:54.101 --> 03:03:54.934
<v Speaker 6>they'll be like,</v>

6865
03:03:55.180 --> 03:03:56.290
<v Speaker 6>oh well not this one.</v>

6866
03:03:56.291 --> 03:03:58.100
<v Speaker 6>But a certain nutritionist went to school for it,</v>

6867
03:03:58.101 --> 03:03:59.120
<v Speaker 6>got all their degrees and are like,</v>

6868
03:03:59.121 --> 03:03:59.301
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

6869
03:03:59.301 --> 03:04:00.800
<v Speaker 6>you can have Mac and cheese for lunch.</v>

6870
03:04:00.801 --> 03:04:04.100
<v Speaker 6>And then we'll have like a some vans waffles to get you started.</v>

6871
03:04:04.101 --> 03:04:04.934
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

6872
03:04:05.150 --> 03:04:08.720
<v Speaker 6>oh well they must have got some 1990s education that I'm saying like how much</v>

6873
03:04:08.721 --> 03:04:11.120
<v Speaker 6>are those are 1990s educations.</v>

6874
03:04:11.180 --> 03:04:12.170
<v Speaker 6>If they don't keep up,</v>

6875
03:04:12.171 --> 03:04:12.471
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

6876
03:04:12.471 --> 03:04:13.340
<v Speaker 6>it can be bad.</v>

6877
03:04:13.341 --> 03:04:13.700
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

6878
03:04:13.700 --> 03:04:16.940
<v Speaker 6>Like those food chains from the fucking eighties and those Dr Seuss books,</v>

6879
03:04:16.941 --> 03:04:17.774
<v Speaker 6>you ever see that shit?</v>

6880
03:04:18.200 --> 03:04:21.530
<v Speaker 6>It was all like cereal and rice and grain at the bottom must get a better,</v>

6881
03:04:21.531 --> 03:04:24.980
<v Speaker 6>have a lot of that and then and then after that it was like meat and there was</v>

6882
03:04:24.981 --> 03:04:27.500
<v Speaker 6>eggs and it was a goofy ass food chain man.</v>

6883
03:04:28.130 --> 03:04:28.460
<v Speaker 6>Damn.</v>

6884
03:04:28.460 --> 03:04:29.300
<v Speaker 6>That's what people thought.</v>

6885
03:04:29.301 --> 03:04:30.020
<v Speaker 6>The Food Pyramid,</v>

6886
03:04:30.020 --> 03:04:32.060
<v Speaker 6>the bottom of it should be grains and breads,</v>

6887
03:04:32.270 --> 03:04:34.370
<v Speaker 6>which are fine as long as you don't have too much of it.</v>

6888
03:04:35.270 --> 03:04:38.150
<v Speaker 6>That should be a moderation thing depending on your goals,</v>

6889
03:04:38.151 --> 03:04:38.420
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

6890
03:04:38.420 --> 03:04:39.260
<v Speaker 6>Like yeah,</v>

6891
03:04:39.261 --> 03:04:42.050
<v Speaker 6>but the thing about the nutrition world,</v>

6892
03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:42.950
<v Speaker 6>the real thing,</v>

6893
03:04:43.270 --> 03:04:48.270
<v Speaker 6>it is so complex and so it's so involved that you really need to talk to an</v>

6894
03:04:52.180 --> 03:04:53.260
<v Speaker 6>actual expert.</v>

6895
03:04:53.261 --> 03:04:54.370
<v Speaker 6>Like if I have issues,</v>

6896
03:04:54.670 --> 03:04:55.960
<v Speaker 6>I have questions about things.</v>

6897
03:04:56.470 --> 03:04:58.810
<v Speaker 6>My number one go to his doctor.</v>

6898
03:04:58.811 --> 03:04:59.680
<v Speaker 6>Rhonda Patrick.</v>

6899
03:04:59.740 --> 03:05:00.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

6900
03:05:00.040 --> 03:05:00.730
<v Speaker 6>number one.</v>

6901
03:05:00.730 --> 03:05:01.391
<v Speaker 6>Cause she's,</v>

6902
03:05:01.391 --> 03:05:06.100
<v Speaker 6>she's 100% scientific with all of her.</v>

6903
03:05:06.130 --> 03:05:07.810
<v Speaker 6>There's no shenanigans.</v>

6904
03:05:07.960 --> 03:05:09.370
<v Speaker 6>When she has an idea about something,</v>

6905
03:05:09.371 --> 03:05:10.280
<v Speaker 6>it's based on study.</v>

6906
03:05:10.281 --> 03:05:13.870
<v Speaker 6>She can cite those studies to you literally at the drop of a hat and she didn't</v>

6907
03:05:13.871 --> 03:05:14.704
<v Speaker 6>tell you what the,</v>

6908
03:05:14.710 --> 03:05:15.910
<v Speaker 6>what's what's going on.</v>

6909
03:05:15.911 --> 03:05:16.321
<v Speaker 6>Like what,</v>

6910
03:05:16.321 --> 03:05:18.730
<v Speaker 6>why is this good with that and why does this help that?</v>

6911
03:05:18.731 --> 03:05:21.790
<v Speaker 6>Why is this hurt that like she's the go to person for me.</v>

6912
03:05:22.030 --> 03:05:23.800
<v Speaker 6>She said she's a wizard,</v>

6913
03:05:24.060 --> 03:05:24.340
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

6914
03:05:24.340 --> 03:05:25.480
<v Speaker 6>she's so fucking smart.</v>

6915
03:05:25.481 --> 03:05:27.550
<v Speaker 6>So like I could ask something like that,</v>

6916
03:05:27.551 --> 03:05:28.240
<v Speaker 6>but I'm not,</v>

6917
03:05:28.240 --> 03:05:30.700
<v Speaker 6>I'm absolutely not a nutrition expert.</v>

6918
03:05:30.701 --> 03:05:33.190
<v Speaker 6>I know what I've been able to do that works pretty good for me.</v>

6919
03:05:33.191 --> 03:05:36.820
<v Speaker 6>And I've got some loose leaf fucking duct taped together knowledge,</v>

6920
03:05:37.330 --> 03:05:41.830
<v Speaker 6>but they're the real people out there like Rhonda Patrick or Rob Wolf for Chris</v>

6921
03:05:41.831 --> 03:05:45.180
<v Speaker 6>crush or Ben Greenfield like I'd bet in here weeks ago,</v>

6922
03:05:45.210 --> 03:05:45.421
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

6923
03:05:45.421 --> 03:05:46.050
<v Speaker 6>he's a wizard.</v>

6924
03:05:46.050 --> 03:05:47.130
<v Speaker 6>Listen that three times.</v>

6925
03:05:47.131 --> 03:05:49.980
<v Speaker 6>What are your probably a purple or brown belt and nutrition then?</v>

6926
03:05:50.100 --> 03:05:50.341
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

6927
03:05:50.341 --> 03:05:51.300
<v Speaker 6>I think I'm a blue belt.</v>

6928
03:05:51.410 --> 03:05:51.890
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

6929
03:05:51.890 --> 03:05:52.140
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

6930
03:05:52.140 --> 03:05:52.640
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

6931
03:05:52.640 --> 03:05:53.510
<v Speaker 6>I'm being honest.</v>

6932
03:05:53.980 --> 03:05:54.721
<v Speaker 6>50 years old.</v>

6933
03:05:54.721 --> 03:05:55.690
<v Speaker 6>And Jack did.</v>

6934
03:05:55.810 --> 03:05:56.760
<v Speaker 6>Just crazy.</v>

6935
03:05:56.761 --> 03:05:57.720
<v Speaker 6>I told you I'm a crazy person.</v>

6936
03:05:57.721 --> 03:05:58.321
<v Speaker 6>I work out a lot.</v>

6937
03:05:58.321 --> 03:05:59.154
<v Speaker 6>I take TRT.</v>

6938
03:05:59.700 --> 03:06:00.030
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

6939
03:06:00.030 --> 03:06:00.870
<v Speaker 6>All those things help.</v>

6940
03:06:00.930 --> 03:06:01.440
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

6941
03:06:01.440 --> 03:06:01.741
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

6942
03:06:01.741 --> 03:06:02.490
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

6943
03:06:02.490 --> 03:06:02.791
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

6944
03:06:02.791 --> 03:06:04.080
<v Speaker 6>the real experts,</v>

6945
03:06:04.081 --> 03:06:04.350
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

6946
03:06:04.350 --> 03:06:04.591
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>

6947
03:06:04.591 --> 03:06:07.050
<v Speaker 6>their knowledge is constantly growing.</v>

6948
03:06:07.051 --> 03:06:12.051
<v Speaker 6>This is the thing about Rhonda that's so fantastic is she's on top of all of</v>

6949
03:06:12.361 --> 03:06:16.350
<v Speaker 6>these peer reviewed papers and new studies and all these things that are going</v>

6950
03:06:16.351 --> 03:06:20.130
<v Speaker 6>on and things that are in the process of going on because she's in this loop of</v>

6951
03:06:20.131 --> 03:06:20.431
<v Speaker 6>clinical,</v>

6952
03:06:20.431 --> 03:06:21.570
<v Speaker 6>she's a clinical researcher,</v>

6953
03:06:21.720 --> 03:06:25.740
<v Speaker 6>so she's in this loop of all these wizards and she does her own podcast.</v>

6954
03:06:25.741 --> 03:06:26.221
<v Speaker 6>So she's like,</v>

6955
03:06:26.221 --> 03:06:28.920
<v Speaker 6>she's constantly up on everything that's going on.</v>

6956
03:06:29.380 --> 03:06:33.120
<v Speaker 6>So she'll send you things about new data and she's always like,</v>

6957
03:06:33.121 --> 03:06:34.350
<v Speaker 6>every time I have her in here,</v>

6958
03:06:34.620 --> 03:06:38.040
<v Speaker 6>it's three hours where I might talk like five times.</v>

6959
03:06:38.310 --> 03:06:39.091
<v Speaker 6>Like I might go.</v>

6960
03:06:39.091 --> 03:06:40.500
<v Speaker 6>So why does that do that?</v>

6961
03:06:40.650 --> 03:06:41.483
<v Speaker 6>That's a good question.</v>

6962
03:06:44.130 --> 03:06:45.790
<v Speaker 6>And she's not even looking at notes,</v>

6963
03:06:45.791 --> 03:06:46.390
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

6964
03:06:46.390 --> 03:06:47.223
<v Speaker 6>Like she's,</v>

6965
03:06:47.500 --> 03:06:50.380
<v Speaker 6>and we get to learn from it at a young age and apply it dude.</v>

6966
03:06:50.381 --> 03:06:50.561
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

6967
03:06:50.561 --> 03:06:53.140
<v Speaker 6>so who's to say we're not fighting healthily at 40?</v>

6968
03:06:53.270 --> 03:06:56.030
<v Speaker 6>If we monitor injuries and monitor our sparring and all that,</v>

6969
03:06:56.040 --> 03:06:56.580
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

03:06:58.640 --> 03:07:00.030
<v Speaker 4>That's the real problem.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Do you guys see that or listen to them to see that one yet?</v>

6974
03:07:05.670 --> 03:07:09.780
<v Speaker 4>She had a significant brain injury apparently from Amanda Nunez.</v>

6975
03:07:09.870 --> 03:07:12.030
<v Speaker 4>Amanda Nunez through some boulders,</v>

6976
03:07:13.070 --> 03:07:14.180
<v Speaker 4>boulders,</v>

6977

6978
03:07:16.200 --> 03:07:17.460
<v Speaker 4>she hurts people.</v>

6979
03:07:17.490 --> 03:07:18.970
<v Speaker 4>She's a fucking killer.</v>

6980
03:07:19.010 --> 03:07:19.530
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

6981
03:07:19.530 --> 03:07:20.363
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

6982
03:07:20.650 --> 03:07:24.780
<v Speaker 4>she was concussed so badly in that fight that if fucked up or hormone levels,</v>

6983
03:07:25.080 --> 03:07:28.470
<v Speaker 4>she became hypo thyroid from that fight and continues to be.</v>

6984
03:07:28.471 --> 03:07:29.071
<v Speaker 4>So to this day,</v>

6985
03:07:29.071 --> 03:07:30.330
<v Speaker 4>she gained 25 pounds.</v>

6986
03:07:30.331 --> 03:07:31.710
<v Speaker 4>She said there were 20,</v>

6987
03:07:31.711 --> 03:07:33.360
<v Speaker 4>25 pounds somewhere in the neighborhood,</v>

6988
03:07:33.630 --> 03:07:35.070
<v Speaker 4>somewhere between 20 and 25 pounds.</v>

6989
03:07:35.071 --> 03:07:35.851
<v Speaker 4>Could not shake it off.</v>

6990
03:07:35.851 --> 03:07:36.091
<v Speaker 4>She goes,</v>

6991
03:07:36.091 --> 03:07:36.360
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

6992
03:07:36.360 --> 03:07:39.450
<v Speaker 4>I was eating like 400 calories a day and my body would not let go of this</v>

6993
03:07:39.451 --> 03:07:40.140
<v Speaker 4>weight.</v>

6994
03:07:40.140 --> 03:07:43.920
<v Speaker 4>And then she found out she was hyperthyroid and she had all sorts of problems</v>

6995
03:07:43.921 --> 03:07:45.330
<v Speaker 4>with her cognition,</v>

6996
03:07:45.331 --> 03:07:46.380
<v Speaker 4>with their memory,</v>

6997
03:07:46.381 --> 03:07:47.100
<v Speaker 4>with her.</v>

6998
03:07:47.100 --> 03:07:47.760
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

6999
03:07:47.760 --> 03:07:49.260
<v Speaker 4>she couldn't see when she was sparring,</v>

7000
03:07:49.261 --> 03:07:50.760
<v Speaker 4>she wasn't seeing things anymore.</v>

7001
03:07:50.850 --> 03:07:52.050
<v Speaker 4>She wasn't seeing reads,</v>

7002
03:07:52.200 --> 03:07:52.411
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

7003
03:07:52.411 --> 03:07:53.850
<v Speaker 4>she wasn't like she fainted,</v>

7004
03:07:53.880 --> 03:07:57.870
<v Speaker 4>she fainted someone she couldn't see their reaction she see was just charging at</v>

7005
03:07:57.871 --> 03:07:58.704
<v Speaker 4>them full blast.</v>

7006
03:07:58.740 --> 03:07:59.011
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

7007
03:07:59.011 --> 03:08:00.480
<v Speaker 4>I had no sense of what I was doing.</v>

7008
03:08:00.630 --> 03:08:04.890
<v Speaker 4>So she started getting this crazy magnetic therapy.</v>

7009
03:08:04.920 --> 03:08:06.240
<v Speaker 4>They do this thing on Instagram.</v>

7010
03:08:06.270 --> 03:08:06.841
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7011
03:08:06.841 --> 03:08:07.920

03:08:07.950 --> 03:08:08.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7013
03:08:08.550 --> 03:08:11.850
<v Speaker 4>And it really helped her 100% brought her back and she said they'd been able to</v>

7014
03:08:11.851 --> 03:08:13.670
<v Speaker 4>do that with soldiers and all these,</v>

7015
03:08:13.680 --> 03:08:17.910
<v Speaker 4>they re ignite all these air and they can target specific areas of your brain</v>

7016
03:08:17.911 --> 03:08:19.650
<v Speaker 4>where you're having a hard time functioning correctly.</v>

7017
03:08:19.890 --> 03:08:20.191
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

7018
03:08:20.191 --> 03:08:20.820

03:08:20.820 --> 03:08:21.031
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7020
03:08:21.031 --> 03:08:24.690
<v Speaker 4>So she got all of her pallets back over issues and you know,</v>

7021
03:08:24.691 --> 03:08:26.770
<v Speaker 4>she says she feels 100% or close to it,</v>

7022
03:08:27.900 --> 03:08:28.733
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that kind of shit,</v>

7024
03:08:29.730 --> 03:08:30.481
<v Speaker 4>it gives me hope.</v>

03:08:30.481 --> 03:08:30.751
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

7026
03:08:30.751 --> 03:08:31.590
<v Speaker 4>Like if they can,</v>

7027
03:08:31.800 --> 03:08:35.190

7028
03:08:35.191 --> 03:08:36.780
<v Speaker 4>Maybe there'll be more in the future.</v>

7404
03:18:18.210 --> 03:18:21.790
<v Speaker 4>I'm Tim was like super relaxed pace himself and got him in there and pop,</v>

7405
03:18:21.791 --> 03:18:22.390
<v Speaker 4>pop,</v>

7406
03:18:22.390 --> 03:18:23.710
<v Speaker 4>not throwing with everything.</v>

7407
03:18:23.711 --> 03:18:25.440
<v Speaker 4>He's got to stay in on him.</v>

7408
03:18:25.990 --> 03:18:26.860
<v Speaker 4>Real pro.</v>

7409
03:18:26.920 --> 03:18:31.920
<v Speaker 4>I mean whoever made this fight is a real fucking like a real sinister person.</v>

7410
03:18:33.870 --> 03:18:34.960
<v Speaker 4>Crazy mismatch.</v>

7411
03:18:35.440 --> 03:18:36.440
<v Speaker 4>But I guess puts you in the house.</v>

7412
03:18:36.441 --> 03:18:37.091
<v Speaker 4>He wanted it,</v>

7413
03:18:37.091 --> 03:18:37.510
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

7414
03:18:37.510 --> 03:18:37.901
<v Speaker 4>That's the what?</v>

7415
03:18:37.901 --> 03:18:38.291
<v Speaker 4>A stud.</v>

7416
03:18:38.291 --> 03:18:39.040
<v Speaker 4>That guy is.</v>

7417
03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:39.491
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>

7418
03:18:39.491 --> 03:18:40.270
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>

7419
03:18:40.270 --> 03:18:40.990
<v Speaker 4>He's a stud.</v>

7420
03:18:40.990 --> 03:18:42.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean he really believed in himself.</v>

7421
03:18:42.550 --> 03:18:44.310
<v Speaker 4>He feels like he's got that kind of power.</v>

7422
03:18:44.311 --> 03:18:45.190
<v Speaker 4>He could kill anybody.</v>

7423
03:18:45.191 --> 03:18:46.270
<v Speaker 4>Just smash them.</v>

7424
03:18:46.360 --> 03:18:47.960
<v Speaker 4>But it didn't work with Tim.</v>

7425
03:18:49.660 --> 03:18:50.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7426
03:18:50.110 --> 03:18:51.900
<v Speaker 4>Tim just eventually started wearing on.</v>

7427
03:18:51.920 --> 03:18:54.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm allowed to do cheer when Randy hit Tim with that overhand right.</v>

7428
03:18:54.860 --> 03:18:55.451
<v Speaker 4>That was crazy.</v>

7429
03:18:55.451 --> 03:18:57.520
<v Speaker 4>I didn't expect her a couple of seconds.</v>

7430
03:18:58.030 --> 03:18:58.481
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

7431
03:18:58.481 --> 03:19:01.000
<v Speaker 4>he threw an inside leg kick and an overhand right.</v>

7432
03:19:01.001 --> 03:19:01.834
<v Speaker 4>And Tim was,</v>

7433
03:19:02.050 --> 03:19:03.100
<v Speaker 4>he was out on his feet.</v>

7434
03:19:03.340 --> 03:19:04.240
<v Speaker 4>Like Tim said.</v>

7435
03:19:04.480 --> 03:19:07.300
<v Speaker 4>He was talking about it at one point in time in the future and he said that he</v>

7436
03:19:07.301 --> 03:19:09.990
<v Speaker 4>forgot what round it was like there.</v>

7437
03:19:10.070 --> 03:19:10.750
<v Speaker 4>He was like a,</v>

7438
03:19:10.750 --> 03:19:11.620
<v Speaker 4>it's only the third round,</v>

7439
03:19:11.621 --> 03:19:11.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

7440
03:19:11.830 --> 03:19:13.240
<v Speaker 4>Like Tim is the last round.</v>

7441
03:19:13.360 --> 03:19:13.631
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

7442
03:19:13.631 --> 03:19:14.440
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

7443
03:19:14.440 --> 03:19:15.670
<v Speaker 4>Like you forgot around.</v>

7444
03:19:16.060 --> 03:19:16.241
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7445
03:19:16.241 --> 03:19:17.020
<v Speaker 4>Like he,</v>

7446
03:19:17.020 --> 03:19:19.450
<v Speaker 4>he probably was out on his feet the whole fight.</v>

7447
03:19:19.780 --> 03:19:19.961
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

7448
03:19:19.961 --> 03:19:20.794
<v Speaker 4>think about that.</v>

7449
03:19:20.800 --> 03:19:21.633
<v Speaker 4>That shot.</v>

7450
03:19:21.640 --> 03:19:22.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

7451
03:19:22.030 --> 03:19:24.280
<v Speaker 4>he gets caught right on the jaw.</v>

7452
03:19:25.510 --> 03:19:26.440
<v Speaker 4>That's nuts.</v>

7453
03:19:26.980 --> 03:19:28.300
<v Speaker 4>Seven seconds down.</v>

7454
03:19:28.360 --> 03:19:31.180
<v Speaker 4>Look at this inside leg kick hammer.</v>

7455
03:19:31.390 --> 03:19:33.790
<v Speaker 4>And it's perfectly placed and you know,</v>

7456
03:19:33.791 --> 03:19:37.060
<v Speaker 4>Tim and him were friends and Tim was really having a hard time believing that</v>

7457
03:19:37.061 --> 03:19:39.820
<v Speaker 4>Randy wanted to fight him because Randy had stated his house.</v>

7458
03:19:39.820 --> 03:19:42.700
<v Speaker 4>They stayed together for a while and been friends and he was off.</v>

7459
03:19:42.760 --> 03:19:43.930
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he didn't stay at his house.</v>

7460
03:19:43.931 --> 03:19:44.710
<v Speaker 4>I might've made that up.</v>

7461
03:19:44.710 --> 03:19:45.370
<v Speaker 4>He keeps it good.</v>

7462
03:19:45.370 --> 03:19:46.150
<v Speaker 4>But they were friends.</v>

7463
03:19:46.150 --> 03:19:49.150
<v Speaker 4>I know they were good friends and so Tim was kind of blown away that Randy</v>

7464
03:19:49.151 --> 03:19:49.721
<v Speaker 4>wanted to fight him.</v>

7465
03:19:49.721 --> 03:19:51.070
<v Speaker 4>But Randy didn't give a fuck.</v>

7466
03:19:51.280 --> 03:19:55.240
<v Speaker 4>Robert Falls told me he'd never saw Randy lives around in the gym ever.</v>

7467
03:19:55.300 --> 03:19:57.070
<v Speaker 4>It's an animal dude.</v>

7468
03:19:57.700 --> 03:20:00.310
<v Speaker 4>I was there for Randy's debut fought two times at night.</v>

7469
03:20:00.400 --> 03:20:01.510
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

7470
03:20:01.511 --> 03:20:02.710
<v Speaker 4>He fought two times that night.</v>

7471
03:20:02.830 --> 03:20:04.030
<v Speaker 4>He strangled to people,</v>

7472
03:20:04.210 --> 03:20:05.020
<v Speaker 4>smashed him.</v>

7473
03:20:05.020 --> 03:20:08.830
<v Speaker 4>And he was basically a wrestler who knew a few submission hold two had dumped</v>

7474
03:20:08.831 --> 03:20:09.910
<v Speaker 4>some boxing in the army,</v>

7475
03:20:10.360 --> 03:20:10.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

7476
03:20:10.810 --> 03:20:11.411
<v Speaker 4>and nobody,</v>

7477
03:20:11.411 --> 03:20:11.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

7478
03:20:11.980 --> 03:20:13.120
<v Speaker 4>nobody knew anything back then.</v>

7479
03:20:13.150 --> 03:20:14.260
<v Speaker 4>It started at 30 something,</v>

7480
03:20:14.261 --> 03:20:14.500
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

7481
03:20:14.500 --> 03:20:14.860
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

7482
03:20:14.860 --> 03:20:18.370
<v Speaker 4>I think he was like 34 or 35 for his UFC debut.</v>

7483
03:20:18.550 --> 03:20:19.340
<v Speaker 4>That's sweet.</v>

7484
03:20:19.340 --> 03:20:20.173
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7485
03:20:20.300 --> 03:20:20.531
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7486
03:20:20.531 --> 03:20:21.700
<v Speaker 4>And then when he fought v toward,</v>

7487
03:20:21.701 --> 03:20:22.480
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

7488
03:20:22.480 --> 03:20:22.960
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

7489
03:20:22.960 --> 03:20:27.960
<v Speaker 4>that was a really important fight in MMA or really important fight because v Tor</v>

7490
03:20:29.440 --> 03:20:32.260
<v Speaker 4>was like 240 plus pounds.</v>

7491
03:20:32.261 --> 03:20:33.780
<v Speaker 4>Then he was a jug.</v>

7492
03:20:34.190 --> 03:20:36.300
<v Speaker 4>Same who was jogging tick.</v>

7493
03:20:36.640 --> 03:20:37.540
<v Speaker 4>And He,</v>

7494
03:20:37.541 --> 03:20:37.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

7495
03:20:37.930 --> 03:20:39.090
<v Speaker 4>had this huge neck,</v>

7496
03:20:39.150 --> 03:20:40.940
<v Speaker 4>his neck started in the middle of his forehead.</v>

7497
03:20:40.941 --> 03:20:44.250
<v Speaker 4>He was just so huge and they had wrote,</v>

7498
03:20:44.260 --> 03:20:45.640
<v Speaker 4>written for is like strengths.</v>

7499
03:20:45.760 --> 03:20:47.620
<v Speaker 4>It's had no known weaknesses.</v>

7500
03:20:48.520 --> 03:20:51.340
<v Speaker 4>Like this is how much of a a monster Vito was.</v>

7501
03:20:51.341 --> 03:20:52.840
<v Speaker 4>He's just light and everybody on fire.</v>

7502
03:20:53.020 --> 03:20:55.210
<v Speaker 4>But he kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger.</v>

7503
03:20:55.390 --> 03:20:56.680
<v Speaker 4>He kept getting thicker and bigger.</v>

7504
03:20:56.681 --> 03:20:58.750
<v Speaker 4>And I think one of the reasons was Mark Coleman,</v>

7505
03:20:59.050 --> 03:21:01.660
<v Speaker 4>I think everybody back then was scared of Mark Coleman.</v>

7506
03:21:01.930 --> 03:21:03.520
<v Speaker 4>Everybody was like fuck.</v>

7507
03:21:03.760 --> 03:21:07.300
<v Speaker 4>Cause Coleman was to 65 and full game.</v>

7508
03:21:08.530 --> 03:21:11.440
<v Speaker 4>He was always like between two 55 and to 60,</v>

7509
03:21:11.441 --> 03:21:12.310
<v Speaker 4>somewhere in that range.</v>

7510
03:21:12.580 --> 03:21:17.560
<v Speaker 4>But so jacked and mark was a fucking serious wrestler and he would take you down</v>

7511
03:21:17.680 --> 03:21:20.800
<v Speaker 4>and he was going to get on top of you and he was going to deliver pain.</v>

7512
03:21:20.950 --> 03:21:23.590
<v Speaker 4>He was smashing people with headbutts,</v>

7513
03:21:23.740 --> 03:21:24.670
<v Speaker 4>no gloves.</v>

7514
03:21:24.790 --> 03:21:28.480
<v Speaker 4>And this is the Mark Coleman error and this is the era where v tour is coming</v>

7515
03:21:28.481 --> 03:21:29.170
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

7516
03:21:29.170 --> 03:21:32.140
<v Speaker 4>So [inaudible] gets to like 240 pounds at fights.</v>

7517
03:21:32.141 --> 03:21:34.240
<v Speaker 4>Randy and Randy survives.</v>

7518
03:21:34.241 --> 03:21:37.510
<v Speaker 4>The opening barrage really doesn't even get hit with much and just starts to</v>

7519
03:21:37.511 --> 03:21:40.990
<v Speaker 4>slowly chip away at detour until he gets him up against cage.</v>

7520
03:21:40.991 --> 03:21:44.770
<v Speaker 4>Beats him up and get some down and smashes him and everybody was in shock.</v>

7521
03:21:44.960 --> 03:21:45.591
<v Speaker 4>Everybody was like,</v>

7522
03:21:45.591 --> 03:21:46.424
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

7523
03:21:46.880 --> 03:21:48.020
<v Speaker 4>How did he lose?</v>

7524
03:21:48.140 --> 03:21:50.630
<v Speaker 4>How's it possible and how did he lose like this?</v>

7525
03:21:50.631 --> 03:21:55.520
<v Speaker 4>It was a really important fight in MMA because it was a fight where you have a</v>

7526
03:21:55.521 --> 03:21:59.780
<v Speaker 4>narrative that you think is playing out and then a lesson gets taught to</v>

7527
03:21:59.781 --> 03:22:00.400
<v Speaker 4>everybody like,</v>

7528
03:22:00.400 --> 03:22:00.531
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

7529
03:22:00.531 --> 03:22:00.620
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

7530
03:22:00.620 --> 03:22:00.990
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

7531
03:22:00.990 --> 03:22:01.350
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

7532
03:22:01.350 --> 03:22:02.330
<v Speaker 4>you got too big.</v>

7533
03:22:02.360 --> 03:22:04.520
<v Speaker 4>This is all muscle that you don't need.</v>

7534
03:22:04.550 --> 03:22:05.480
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't help you.</v>

7535
03:22:05.660 --> 03:22:06.740
<v Speaker 4>You get tired.</v>

7536
03:22:06.860 --> 03:22:08.420
<v Speaker 4>You need to have better endurance.</v>

7537
03:22:08.540 --> 03:22:09.850
<v Speaker 4>This is not the way you,</v>

7538
03:22:09.851 --> 03:22:10.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

7539
03:22:10.071 --> 03:22:13.280
<v Speaker 4>you fight against a guy who can survive and we didn't know that yet because</v>

7540
03:22:13.281 --> 03:22:16.140
<v Speaker 4>nobody knew that there was going to be people who survived.</v>

7541
03:22:16.150 --> 03:22:16.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7542
03:22:16.400 --> 03:22:17.001
<v Speaker 4>Nobody knew this.</v>

7543
03:22:17.001 --> 03:22:18.590
<v Speaker 4>We going to be people with submission defense.</v>

7544
03:22:18.591 --> 03:22:19.610
<v Speaker 4>When people are caught and submissions,</v>

7545
03:22:19.611 --> 03:22:20.740
<v Speaker 4>they tapped it'll,</v>

7546
03:22:20.750 --> 03:22:22.820
<v Speaker 4>how often did anybody get it out of anything back then?</v>

7547
03:22:23.030 --> 03:22:23.691
<v Speaker 4>Like we know one,</v>

7548
03:22:23.691 --> 03:22:25.940
<v Speaker 4>he knew the progression that it was going to take.</v>

7549
03:22:26.070 --> 03:22:28.160
<v Speaker 4>We learned in that Randy fight that there's,</v>

7550
03:22:28.430 --> 03:22:30.440
<v Speaker 4>there's a certain level of winner.</v>

7551
03:22:30.650 --> 03:22:31.730
<v Speaker 4>There's guys that just,</v>

7552
03:22:31.790 --> 03:22:33.860
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking mental animals.</v>

7553
03:22:33.950 --> 03:22:35.390
<v Speaker 4>They just know how to win.</v>

7554
03:22:35.391 --> 03:22:38.300
<v Speaker 4>They know how to break people and you get to see that in Randy.</v>

7555
03:22:39.890 --> 03:22:40.230
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

7556
03:22:40.230 --> 03:22:40.990
<v Speaker 4>It's sweet.</v>

7557
03:22:40.990 --> 03:22:41.751
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

7558
03:22:41.751 --> 03:22:42.460
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

7559
03:22:42.460 --> 03:22:46.220
<v Speaker 4>and then everyone thought all the Machida era and there's really,</v>

7560
03:22:46.250 --> 03:22:46.671
<v Speaker 4>that was me,</v>

7561
03:22:46.671 --> 03:22:47.504
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

7562
03:22:47.590 --> 03:22:48.680
<v Speaker 4>but the smarter we get,</v>

7563
03:22:48.681 --> 03:22:49.160
<v Speaker 4>the real,</v>

7564
03:22:49.160 --> 03:22:50.300
<v Speaker 4>there's no going to be an error.</v>

7565
03:22:50.330 --> 03:22:52.130
<v Speaker 4>But then you wonder what John Jones,</v>

7566
03:22:52.160 --> 03:22:52.371
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

7567
03:22:52.371 --> 03:22:54.170
<v Speaker 4>there's a John Jones air right now.</v>

7568
03:22:54.200 --> 03:22:54.381
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

7569
03:22:54.381 --> 03:22:55.670
<v Speaker 4>this is the John Jones era.</v>

7570
03:22:55.700 --> 03:22:56.690
<v Speaker 4>No question about it.</v>

7571
03:22:56.720 --> 03:22:58.880
<v Speaker 4>If you look at the actual results in fights,</v>

7572
03:22:58.910 --> 03:23:00.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't care what they say about anything else.</v>

7573
03:23:00.920 --> 03:23:02.270
<v Speaker 4>This is what people are gonna remember.</v>

7574
03:23:02.480 --> 03:23:05.750
<v Speaker 4>When you go back and look at this era of light heavyweights,</v>

7575
03:23:05.751 --> 03:23:07.160
<v Speaker 4>you think about Jon Jones.</v>

7576
03:23:07.340 --> 03:23:10.310
<v Speaker 4>It's just like when Muhammad Ali was in his prime,</v>

7577
03:23:10.311 --> 03:23:13.700
<v Speaker 4>people thought about Ali when sugar ray Leonard was a welterweight champion.</v>

7578
03:23:13.701 --> 03:23:14.540
<v Speaker 4>People thought about sugar.</v>

7579
03:23:14.541 --> 03:23:15.020
<v Speaker 4>Ray,</v>

7580
03:23:15.020 --> 03:23:16.280
<v Speaker 4>you got to think about Jon Jones.</v>

7581
03:23:16.310 --> 03:23:17.740
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely the Jon Jones era,</v>

7582
03:23:18.260 --> 03:23:21.550
<v Speaker 4>but it's just an error of so much turmoil and you know,</v>

7583
03:23:21.560 --> 03:23:26.560
<v Speaker 4>you want to talk about a guy who had more potential than probably anybody I've</v>

7584
03:23:26.780 --> 03:23:28.940
<v Speaker 4>ever seen fight and anybody.</v>

7585
03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:29.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

7586
03:23:29.810 --> 03:23:32.960
<v Speaker 4>and John Does the same kind of shit that you were telling me that you do.</v>

7587
03:23:33.310 --> 03:23:34.850
<v Speaker 4>He just makes things up while he's in there.</v>

7588
03:23:34.851 --> 03:23:36.200
<v Speaker 4>Just sees things and goes with it.</v>

7589
03:23:36.530 --> 03:23:39.500
<v Speaker 4>Like that thing that he did with glow over that over hook or yanked,</v>

7590
03:23:39.501 --> 03:23:41.060
<v Speaker 4>I shoulder's fucked of a shoulder.</v>

7591
03:23:41.061 --> 03:23:41.930
<v Speaker 4>Gracie luck.</v>

7592
03:23:41.990 --> 03:23:42.201
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

7593
03:23:42.201 --> 03:23:42.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

7594
03:23:42.470 --> 03:23:44.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he ever did that in the past before,</v>

7595
03:23:44.241 --> 03:23:47.020
<v Speaker 4>but it didn't look like it looked like you probably just saw it right there and</v>

7596
03:23:47.021 --> 03:23:50.570
<v Speaker 4>so let me just yank on this fuck up is fuck up his shoulder.</v>

7597
03:23:51.260 --> 03:23:52.490
<v Speaker 4>John would do crazy shit.</v>

7598
03:23:52.491 --> 03:23:54.590
<v Speaker 4>Spinning elbows and all that.</v>

7599
03:23:54.680 --> 03:23:55.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

7600
03:23:55.100 --> 03:23:55.671
<v Speaker 4>he's just,</v>

7601
03:23:55.671 --> 03:23:58.910
<v Speaker 4>he knows how to be loose in there and knows that he knows how to do things.</v>

7602
03:23:59.030 --> 03:23:59.300
<v Speaker 4>I wonder.</v>

7603
03:23:59.300 --> 03:23:59.850
<v Speaker 4>Steep Age,</v>

7604
03:23:59.850 --> 03:24:00.500
<v Speaker 4>John Mackey,</v>

7605
03:24:00.500 --> 03:24:01.333
<v Speaker 4>if you're seeing that,</v>

7606
03:24:01.940 --> 03:24:03.170
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe we're going to see Steve Bay.</v>

7607
03:24:03.171 --> 03:24:04.460
<v Speaker 4>DC can't believe it either.</v>

7608
03:24:05.720 --> 03:24:06.740
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe it.</v>

7609
03:24:06.910 --> 03:24:10.300
<v Speaker 4>The live raising more jack for that flight than any Brian or take,</v>

7610
03:24:10.320 --> 03:24:11.153
<v Speaker 4>correct.</v>

7611
03:24:11.370 --> 03:24:11.730
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

7612
03:24:11.730 --> 03:24:12.171
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

7613
03:24:12.171 --> 03:24:13.340
<v Speaker 4>That's the Vegas card.</v>

7614
03:24:13.790 --> 03:24:15.200
<v Speaker 4>That is a crazy fight.</v>

7615
03:24:15.230 --> 03:24:16.063
<v Speaker 4>Who Wins?</v>

7616
03:24:16.460 --> 03:24:21.380
<v Speaker 4>Steve Bay and DC is very interesting because the last time that we saw steep a</v>

7617
03:24:21.680 --> 03:24:26.680
<v Speaker 4>in like a fight with a really high level wrestler was who?</v>

7618
03:24:27.700 --> 03:24:28.370
<v Speaker 4>Who was that?</v>

7619
03:24:28.370 --> 03:24:31.820
<v Speaker 4>Who was the last fight where Steve Bay fought someone who really knew how to</v>

7620
03:24:31.821 --> 03:24:32.654
<v Speaker 4>wrestle?</v>

7621
03:24:32.990 --> 03:24:33.780
<v Speaker 4>Who's it been?</v>

7622
03:24:33.780 --> 03:24:34.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to think.</v>

7623
03:24:36.740 --> 03:24:36.921
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

7624
03:24:36.921 --> 03:24:38.150
<v Speaker 4>he's fought tough guys.</v>

7625
03:24:38.151 --> 03:24:38.511
<v Speaker 4>He fought.</v>

7626
03:24:38.511 --> 03:24:39.170
<v Speaker 4>Mark Hon.</v>

7627
03:24:39.170 --> 03:24:40.060
<v Speaker 4>If our junior,</v>

7628
03:24:40.061 --> 03:24:43.000
<v Speaker 4>it was much more of a boxer briefs.</v>

7629
03:24:43.320 --> 03:24:44.153
<v Speaker 4>Shoot.</v>

7630
03:24:44.190 --> 03:24:44.431
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

7631
03:24:44.431 --> 03:24:46.270
<v Speaker 6>Fabricio didn't mean mean free per receive.</v>

7632
03:24:46.271 --> 03:24:47.370
<v Speaker 6>Your attack coming in.</v>

7633
03:24:47.700 --> 03:24:50.220
<v Speaker 6>So who is like the toughest wrestler he fought?</v>

7634
03:24:50.670 --> 03:24:52.470
<v Speaker 6>If you go back a little bit further,</v>

7635
03:24:52.500 --> 03:24:53.333
<v Speaker 6>let's see,</v>

7636
03:24:54.450 --> 03:24:58.070
<v Speaker 6>really Nelson Roy Nelson didn't really keys.</v>

7637
03:24:58.130 --> 03:24:59.000
<v Speaker 6>I mean Roy Nelson,</v>

7638
03:24:59.180 --> 03:25:00.020
<v Speaker 6>let's be honest.</v>

7639
03:25:00.050 --> 03:25:01.970
<v Speaker 6>Roy Nelson could fight middleweight,</v>

7640
03:25:03.170 --> 03:25:03.720
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

7641
03:25:03.720 --> 03:25:04.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

7642
03:25:04.100 --> 03:25:05.090
<v Speaker 6>He's just an animal.</v>

7643
03:25:05.570 --> 03:25:06.830
<v Speaker 6>If he wanted to lose that gut,</v>

7644
03:25:06.860 --> 03:25:07.790
<v Speaker 6>how much would he lose?</v>

7645
03:25:07.820 --> 03:25:08.750
<v Speaker 6>Holy smokes,</v>

7646
03:25:08.751 --> 03:25:09.020
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

7647
03:25:09.020 --> 03:25:10.880
<v Speaker 6>He's probably walking around about two 50 right.</v>

7648
03:25:10.910 --> 03:25:12.080
<v Speaker 6>But that giant crazy belly.</v>

7649
03:25:12.110 --> 03:25:12.890
<v Speaker 6>My height,</v>

7650
03:25:12.890 --> 03:25:14.390
<v Speaker 6>which is part of his trademark.</v>

7651
03:25:14.730 --> 03:25:15.470
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

7652
03:25:15.470 --> 03:25:20.470
<v Speaker 6>But if he decided to cut weight and just go on some crazy diet and cut out all</v>

7653
03:25:21.231 --> 03:25:23.750
<v Speaker 6>the bullshit and drain all the fat,</v>

7654
03:25:24.980 --> 03:25:25.970
<v Speaker 6>what do you think he would way?</v>

7655
03:25:26.150 --> 03:25:28.430
<v Speaker 6>I think you make one 85 easily.</v>

7656
03:25:28.431 --> 03:25:28.811
<v Speaker 6>One eight,</v>

7657
03:25:28.811 --> 03:25:29.420
<v Speaker 6>five dude.</v>

7658
03:25:29.420 --> 03:25:29.841
<v Speaker 6>Easily.</v>

7659
03:25:29.841 --> 03:25:30.674
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

7660
03:25:30.850 --> 03:25:31.683
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

7661
03:25:32.780 --> 03:25:33.620
<v Speaker 6>Whoa man.</v>

7662
03:25:34.970 --> 03:25:37.040
<v Speaker 6>The thing is like Steve Bay's a wrestler,</v>

7663
03:25:37.041 --> 03:25:39.210
<v Speaker 6>he's knows what he needs to do and like,</v>

7664
03:25:39.450 --> 03:25:40.020
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

7665
03:25:40.020 --> 03:25:40.880
<v Speaker 6>going to find out,</v>

7666
03:25:40.881 --> 03:25:41.060
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

7667
03:25:41.060 --> 03:25:42.500
<v Speaker 6>he is a wrestler for sure,</v>

7668
03:25:42.530 --> 03:25:47.060
<v Speaker 6>but he's not the same caliber of wrestler that Daniel Cormier is.</v>

7669
03:25:47.300 --> 03:25:51.680
<v Speaker 6>But Daniel Cormier is a legit light heavyweight who has fought successfully at</v>

7670
03:25:51.681 --> 03:25:52.790
<v Speaker 6>heavyweight and never lost it.</v>

7671
03:25:52.791 --> 03:25:53.241
<v Speaker 6>Heavyweight.</v>

7672
03:25:53.241 --> 03:25:53.540
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>

7673
03:25:53.540 --> 03:25:56.720
<v Speaker 6>So it makes it real interesting because Daniel,</v>

7674
03:25:56.760 --> 03:25:57.050
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

7675
03:25:57.050 --> 03:25:57.441
<v Speaker 6>Daniel,</v>

7676
03:25:57.441 --> 03:26:00.230
<v Speaker 6>remember when he fought Josh Barnett and fucking set up sailing through the air?</v>

7677
03:26:00.470 --> 03:26:03.820
<v Speaker 6>Josh is a big fella and that fucker can grapple today.</v>

7678
03:26:03.830 --> 03:26:04.663
<v Speaker 6>He can grapple.</v>

7679
03:26:04.730 --> 03:26:06.080
<v Speaker 6>He really knows how to grapple.</v>

7680
03:26:06.300 --> 03:26:06.690
<v Speaker 6>Damion,</v>

7681
03:26:06.690 --> 03:26:07.011
<v Speaker 6>that's a,</v>

7682
03:26:07.011 --> 03:26:08.740
<v Speaker 6>that's a big fucking tall.</v>

7683
03:26:09.140 --> 03:26:10.600
<v Speaker 6>I forgot Francis and who?</v>

7684
03:26:10.610 --> 03:26:11.443
<v Speaker 6>Derrick Lewis.</v>

7685
03:26:16.310 --> 03:26:17.420
<v Speaker 6>Don't blink.</v>

7686
03:26:17.710 --> 03:26:22.160
<v Speaker 6>Xtrordinair Holy Shit Dude.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Did he beat him or was it like a split decision?</v>

7754
03:28:15.730 --> 03:28:17.770

03:28:38.041 --> 03:28:38.980
<v Speaker 6>Split decision.</v>

<v Speaker 6>that's what it was.</v>

7778
03:28:41.080 --> 03:28:46.080
<v Speaker 6>So he wants to put decision way back in 2013 and then Tj beat him in 2017 is I</v>

7779
03:28:47.681 --> 03:28:47.801
<v Speaker 6>would,</v>

7780
03:28:47.801 --> 03:28:49.900
<v Speaker 6>it was 16 TJ.</v>

7781
03:28:50.140 --> 03:28:51.760
<v Speaker 6>Well it's Tj just got a lot better.</v>

7784
03:28:53.800 --> 03:28:57.370
<v Speaker 6>What do you think about him possibly moving to light with two a flyweight that's</v>

7785
03:28:57.371 --> 03:28:58.204
<v Speaker 6>crazy,</v>

03:28:58.781 --> 03:28:59.650
<v Speaker 6>I don't know why he would want,</v>

7788
03:28:59.651 --> 03:29:00.880
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to fight Dj.</v>

7789
03:29:00.880 --> 03:29:01.713
<v Speaker 6>That makes sense.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I opened up that cash register baby.</v>

<v Speaker 6>no shit.</v>

7795
03:29:12.520 --> 03:29:15.530
<v Speaker 6>I hope he realizes that that is a legitimate super fight.</v>

7796
03:29:15.550 --> 03:29:17.440
<v Speaker 6>If they can prove all that shit in advance.</v>

7797
03:29:17.680 --> 03:29:17.921
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>

7804
03:29:26.830 --> 03:29:30.280
<v Speaker 6>But TJ is the scariest guy that he's ever had a fight.</v>

7805
03:29:30.490 --> 03:29:31.000
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>

7806
03:29:31.000 --> 03:29:35.680
<v Speaker 6>Tj goes down to one 25 if he could do it and be healthy.</v>

7807
03:29:35.681 --> 03:29:36.461
<v Speaker 6>He's a scariest guy.</v>

7808
03:29:36.461 --> 03:29:41.230
<v Speaker 6>Mighty mouse is ever fought cause he's a legit knockout artist at 35 he's super</v>

7809
03:29:41.231 --> 03:29:41.711
<v Speaker 6>fast.</v>

7810
03:29:41.711 --> 03:29:42.521
<v Speaker 6>He's sneaky,</v>

7811
03:29:42.521 --> 03:29:43.510
<v Speaker 6>he's technical.</v>

7812
03:29:44.130 --> 03:29:45.070
<v Speaker 6>He can wrestle.</v>

7813
03:29:45.220 --> 03:29:46.570
<v Speaker 6>He's a real good wrestler.</v>

7814
03:29:46.750 --> 03:29:51.130
<v Speaker 6>He's got a hundred percent legit knockout power at 35 what is it going to have</v>

7815
03:29:51.131 --> 03:29:52.750
<v Speaker 6>at 25 you know,</v>

7816
03:29:52.780 --> 03:29:53.021
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

7817
03:29:53.021 --> 03:29:56.470
<v Speaker 6>TJ might be a monster at 25 he can really make it.</v>

7818
03:29:57.070 --> 03:29:58.150
<v Speaker 6>That is a crazy,</v>

7819
03:29:58.151 --> 03:29:58.781
<v Speaker 6>crazy fight.</v>

7820
03:29:58.781 --> 03:29:59.740
<v Speaker 6>I love that fight.</v>

7821
03:29:59.810 --> 03:30:02.250
<v Speaker 6>Nobody walks around that because I'm the right cut the 25 one time.</v>

7822
03:30:02.251 --> 03:30:03.700
<v Speaker 6>I did not feel like I had power.</v>

7823
03:30:04.560 --> 03:30:06.850
<v Speaker 6>I thought one time at 25 and I felt worse.</v>

7824
03:30:06.910 --> 03:30:07.421
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

7825
03:30:07.421 --> 03:30:08.620
<v Speaker 6>He insists that he's done it.</v>

7826
03:30:09.010 --> 03:30:10.390
<v Speaker 6>He insists he can make it.</v>

7827
03:30:10.520 --> 03:30:11.081
<v Speaker 6>He's good to set.</v>

7828
03:30:11.081 --> 03:30:11.381
<v Speaker 6>I know.</v>

7829
03:30:11.381 --> 03:30:12.214
<v Speaker 6>I can make it.</v>

7830
03:30:12.760 --> 03:30:14.530
<v Speaker 6>He looks smaller than he's looked in the past.</v>

7831
03:30:14.830 --> 03:30:15.071
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

7832
03:30:15.071 --> 03:30:16.780
<v Speaker 6>he might've been aiming towards it,</v>

7833
03:30:16.830 --> 03:30:17.310
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

7834
03:30:17.310 --> 03:30:18.250
<v Speaker 6>working towards it.</v>

7835
03:30:19.090 --> 03:30:19.923
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

7836
03:30:20.110 --> 03:30:21.820
<v Speaker 6>I'm super excited about his rematch.</v>

7837
03:30:21.860 --> 03:30:22.780
<v Speaker 6>The Cody Garbrandt.</v>

7838
03:30:23.740 --> 03:30:24.573
<v Speaker 6>Whew.</v>

7839
03:30:25.240 --> 03:30:26.470
<v Speaker 6>That's a very intense,</v>

7840
03:30:26.920 --> 03:30:27.910
<v Speaker 6>that's an intense fight.</v>

7841
03:30:28.090 --> 03:30:28.691
<v Speaker 6>That first one.</v>

7842
03:30:28.691 --> 03:30:30.040
<v Speaker 6>But I mean,</v>

7843
03:30:30.070 --> 03:30:30.701
<v Speaker 6>don't forget,</v>

7844
03:30:30.701 --> 03:30:33.790
<v Speaker 6>Cody cracked him and dropped him before Tj put them away.</v>

7845
03:30:33.791 --> 03:30:34.001
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

7846
03:30:34.001 --> 03:30:34.834
<v Speaker 6>that was spicy.</v>

7847
03:30:35.110 --> 03:30:36.100
<v Speaker 6>It was awesome.</v>

7848
03:30:36.120 --> 03:30:37.870
<v Speaker 6>How some real intensity wasn't it?</v>

7849
03:30:37.930 --> 03:30:38.741
<v Speaker 6>Fuck yeah man.</v>

7850
03:30:38.741 --> 03:30:40.340
<v Speaker 6>Those were close</v>

7851
03:30:40.400 --> 03:30:43.310
<v Speaker 5>training partners and they probably always knew that this was one day going to</v>

7852
03:30:43.311 --> 03:30:44.144
<v Speaker 5>go down.</v>

7853
03:30:44.320 --> 03:30:45.070
<v Speaker 5>Dale was,</v>

7854
03:30:45.070 --> 03:30:47.540
<v Speaker 5>Cody released that video of him knocking out Tj.</v>

7855
03:30:47.690 --> 03:30:47.811
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

7856
03:30:47.811 --> 03:30:49.010
<v Speaker 5>but the thing is he didn't knock him out,</v>

7857
03:30:49.220 --> 03:30:49.900
<v Speaker 5>dropped him.</v>

7858
03:30:49.900 --> 03:30:51.950
<v Speaker 5>A teacher was yelling at him right after traveler.</v>

7859
03:30:52.040 --> 03:30:52.320
<v Speaker 5>C'Mon,</v>

7860
03:30:52.320 --> 03:30:53.360
<v Speaker 5>C'mon motherfucker.</v>

7861
03:30:53.660 --> 03:30:54.990
<v Speaker 5>So it wasn't really a knockout,</v>

7862
03:30:55.030 --> 03:30:55.280
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

7863
03:30:55.280 --> 03:30:57.380
<v Speaker 5>It was basically the same thing that happened in their fight.</v>

7864
03:30:57.381 --> 03:31:01.750
<v Speaker 5>And TJ wound up when I knock out really was it was a flash knockdown.</v>

7865
03:31:03.100 --> 03:31:04.250
<v Speaker 5>They're both animals though.</v>

7866
03:31:04.450 --> 03:31:05.420
<v Speaker 5>I took good right there,</v>

7867

<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

7869
03:31:06.201 --> 03:31:08.420
<v Speaker 5>and you know Cody's going to be helped bent on revenge.</v>

7870
03:31:08.990 --> 03:31:09.321

7872
03:31:10.700 --> 03:31:11.630
