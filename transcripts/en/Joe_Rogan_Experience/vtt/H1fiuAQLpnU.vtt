<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus Louisa's.</v>

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Are you allowed to say that anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually you won't be allowed to say </v>

3
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.520
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Duncan Trussell,</v>

4
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>but you know you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd say whatever the fuck you want.</v>

5

<v Speaker 1>If you're using a Tang cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like a Mitch Hedberg </v>

6
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:20.230
<v Speaker 1>punchline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A tank cell phone thing is a one of our </v>

7
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:25.371
<v Speaker 1>favorite sponsors because we've had </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends that use it and they actually </v>

8
00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:28.491
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it and they do save money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a way to use a high level cell </v>

9
00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:32.511
<v Speaker 1>phone service sprint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They buy time on the sprint network and </v>

10
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>but they give it to you at a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate.</v>

11
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>They give it to you in a way that's much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more flexible.</v>

12
00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:38.790

15
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.830

<v Speaker 1>own.</v>

16
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>I should just preface this advertisement</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>

17
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Ninety eight percent of people would </v>
<v Speaker 1>save money with Ting.</v>

18
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.370

<v Speaker 1>phones that are available like the </v>

20
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.791

<v Speaker 1>one or the galaxy s four.</v>

22
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 1>Galaxy has for us probably the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>size phone,</v>

23
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a glutton so I needed that big </v>

<v Speaker 1>Ting doesn't sell the nexus five yet,</v>

60
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.190

<v Speaker 2>considered in Buddhism a form</v>

61
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.190
<v Speaker 3>of anger that boredom is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>widows boredom itself or the expression </v>

<v Speaker 3>of boredom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boredom.</v>

64
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 3>because it's a resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boredom is a,</v>

<v Speaker 3>n I t,</v>

75
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.990
<v Speaker 3>t boredom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were saying Duncan trussell is a </v>

76
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.731
<v Speaker 3>form of anger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to this Jack Kornfield </v>

77
00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 3>audio book and he was saying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>boredom.</v>

78
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 3>That ain't that boredom is part is it </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from anger because it's resistance</v>

79
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 3>to what is when you're bored.</v>

80
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 3>You're resisting what's happening and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a form of anger.</v>

81
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:02.390
<v Speaker 3>It's in the family of anger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell it to the dude.</v>

82
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 3>Been in solitary confinement for five </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

83
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 3>I'd be fucking pissed you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

84
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:10.640
<v Speaker 3>I think that guy needs to stretch out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that definition a bit,</v>

85
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 3>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reasonable boredom,</v>

86
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.230
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever taken an ear beating from </v>

87
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:18.230
<v Speaker 3>somebody that's not anger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's your board?</v>

88
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's totally real,</v>

89
00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 3>but it's always resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're experiencing boredom,</v>

90
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.860
<v Speaker 3>you're resisting what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be there.</v>

91
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 3>That's what border but isn't resistance </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes.</v>

92
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 3>Exactly the right thing to be doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean.</v>

93
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.620
<v Speaker 3>There's a passivity at the heart of some</v>
<v Speaker 3>Buddhist scholarship that I find </v>

94
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.701
<v Speaker 3>irritating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is something I used to think and I </v>

95
00:04:41.701 --> 00:04:41.701
<v Speaker 3>disagree with that now because I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you.</v>

96
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 3>You definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like suddenly you're like,</v>

97
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to be in every situation </v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm in.</v>

98
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 3>It's just that instead of being in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation experiencing that,</v>

99
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 3>if what you're saying is the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing that will motivate people</v>

100
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 3>to change is pain and the idea is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

101
00:04:56.531 --> 00:04:58.660
<v Speaker 3>that's an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not what you need.</v>

102
00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 3>You don't need pain too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>

103
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 3>If I'm in a house that's on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get out of the house before</v>

104
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:06.850
<v Speaker 3>the fire burns me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need a feeling,</v>

105
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.270
<v Speaker 3>a physical experience of pain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>boredom,</v>

106
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 3>desire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anger,</v>

107
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 3>all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you really feel them,</v>

108
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 3>it's not the greatest feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's never a great feeling.</v>

109
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:22.441
<v Speaker 3>It's always either a forum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like an itchiness or a sense of </v>

110
00:05:22.441 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 3>just wanting to get out of where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

111
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.150
<v Speaker 3>but if you really want to get out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're at,</v>

112
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.360
<v Speaker 3>the best thing to do is to calm yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can get into a nice tranquil </v>

113
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 3>state and then get out of the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need the addition of a kind of</v>

114
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:35.860
<v Speaker 3>psychic heartburn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what boredom is.</v>

115
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm full of psychic heartburn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The worst when people are giving me your</v>

116
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.630
<v Speaker 3>beatings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know it can be doing something more </v>

117
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.630
<v Speaker 3>pleasurable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

118
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.630
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

119
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.630
<v Speaker 3>I can't take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

120
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

121
00:05:45.891 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

122
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.690
<v Speaker 3>that is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

123
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly like the idea is if we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can,</v>

124
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:54.550
<v Speaker 3>if we can dissolve that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sense of resistance,</v>

125
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 3>then it doesn't mean that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be getting ear beatings from now</v>

126
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.470
<v Speaker 4>until infinity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just when the ir beatings come,</v>

127
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.740
<v Speaker 4>you only be experiencing the pain of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ear beatings and not the internal </v>

128
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.911
<v Speaker 4>mirroring of that pain as you </v>
<v Speaker 4>desperately try to get out of the </v>

129
00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 4>situation by saying you have to use the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bathroom for the ninth time.</v>

130
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:18.101
<v Speaker 4>And some people at the comedy store </v>
<v Speaker 4>think I have like a serious bladder </v>

131
00:06:18.101 --> 00:06:18.101
<v Speaker 4>issue because</v>

<v Speaker 6>lightness of being.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's one of those names that I've never </v>

<v Speaker 6>But no,</v>

142

<v Speaker 6>See,</v>

143
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.190
<v Speaker 6>I've only seen it written down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

144
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.900
<v Speaker 6>Well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I met her in this weird story.</v>

145
00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:53.680
<v Speaker 6>I was speaking at this event like a Ted </v>
<v Speaker 6>style event in Toronto.</v>

146
00:06:53.681 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 6>It's called idea city.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

147
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.130
<v Speaker 6>the day I was supposed to speak Deepak </v>
<v Speaker 6>Chopra was there,</v>

148
00:07:00.131 --> 00:07:01.990
<v Speaker 6>all these big shots.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The day I was supposed to speak,</v>

149
00:07:01.991 --> 00:07:04.330
<v Speaker 6>I told my wife because soda,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm just going to sleep in today.</v>

150
00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:05.620
<v Speaker 6>Just let me sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You go ahead,</v>

151
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.480
<v Speaker 6>go to listen to the lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

152
00:07:07.481 --> 00:07:08.140
<v Speaker 6>And I'm gonna Hang.</v>

153
00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.220
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fine.</v>

154
00:07:09.221 --> 00:07:12.990
<v Speaker 6>So she goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ten minutes later she's back up from the</v>

155
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.290
<v Speaker 6>room.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She says Julia had been,</v>

156
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.710
<v Speaker 6>she's downstairs having breakfast and </v>
<v Speaker 6>she wants to meet you like Julia B.</v>

157
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.510
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she wants to meet me.</v>

158
00:07:19.511 --> 00:07:20.380
<v Speaker 6>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

159
00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:25.381
<v Speaker 6>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I get out of bed and brush my teeth </v>

160
00:07:25.381 --> 00:07:27.901
<v Speaker 6>or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I called downstairs and I immediately </v>

161
00:07:27.901 --> 00:07:29.620
<v Speaker 6>sense that she doesn't really want to </v>
<v Speaker 6>meet me,</v>

162
00:07:29.621 --> 00:07:34.621
<v Speaker 6>which she wants to do is sleep with my </v>
<v Speaker 6>wife and my wife is completely </v>

163
00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.100
<v Speaker 6>misinterpreted everything and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>barging in on this thing.</v>

164
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I started talking to her about the </v>

165
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.390
<v Speaker 6>unbearable lightness of being this great</v>
<v Speaker 6>film.</v>

166
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:46.201
<v Speaker 6>She was in based on an amazing book and </v>
<v Speaker 6>how this book sort of changed my life </v>

167
00:07:46.201 --> 00:07:48.220
<v Speaker 6>because it got me this job and all this </v>
<v Speaker 6>weird shit and as I'm telling the story,</v>

168
00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:50.290
<v Speaker 6>she's reaches over.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's looking right at me.</v>

169
00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:55.291
<v Speaker 6>She reaches over and she just touches </v>
<v Speaker 6>her blackberry and 30 seconds later it </v>

170
00:07:55.291 --> 00:07:56.320
<v Speaker 6>starts ringing and she picks it up and </v>
<v Speaker 6>she goes,</v>

171
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.980
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry.</v>

172
00:07:56.981 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 6>I have to.</v>

173
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.560
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

174
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:01.220
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

175
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

176
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:03.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fine.</v>

177
00:08:03.321 --> 00:08:08.321
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not offended whenever I have done </v>

178
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.271
<v Speaker 5>the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I was really done the same thing </v>

179
00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:10.271
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

180
00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:11.270
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't have said like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got to go pee for the ninth time.</v>

181
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:16.271
<v Speaker 5>This hour with Dunkin's doesn't seem </v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're just throwing you under the </v>

182
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:18.270
<v Speaker 5>bus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

183
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.900
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just saying it's the same phenomenon.</v>

184
00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:23.860
<v Speaker 5>And I was on the other end of it and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was just at a different level.</v>

185
00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:29.110
<v Speaker 5>It's escape hatches built in boring </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation because I know I'm going to</v>

186
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:37.310
<v Speaker 5>be talking to this dummy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so why is that?</v>

187
00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:40.190
<v Speaker 5>Not In the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it existed three,</v>

188
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 5>but you need like a satellite,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a three button click or like five clicks</v>

189
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.400
<v Speaker 5>or taps out up with the volume and </v>
<v Speaker 5>starts calling you in 30 seconds you </v>

190
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 5>would know or you just get busted </v>
<v Speaker 5>immediately.</v>

191
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:52.430
<v Speaker 5>Everyone know like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute.</v>

192
00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:57.431
<v Speaker 5>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you don't touch your phone when I'm </v>

193
00:08:57.431 --> 00:08:57.431
<v Speaker 5>talking to you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

194
00:08:57.431 --> 00:09:02.031
<v Speaker 5>Ultimately could never really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>truly be successful is if it became </v>

195
00:09:02.031 --> 00:09:03.720
<v Speaker 5>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People know and it wouldn't work anymore</v>

196
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 5>and you have to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute,</v>

197
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You program it yourself that way.</v>

198
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.460
<v Speaker 5>It's a different pattern all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody would know or a key word that </v>

199
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.421
<v Speaker 5>Siri hears you say eventually triggers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Eventually funds are going to be so </v>

200
00:09:17.421 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 5>smart that it's going to not want to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>an ear beating.</v>

201
00:09:20.641 --> 00:09:21.350
<v Speaker 5>Like it's gonna.</v>

202
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Call you and be like,</v>

203
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.390
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we gotta get Outta here,</v>

204
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:28.740
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is horrible.</v>

205
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.850
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought you meant from,</v>

206
00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:34.110
<v Speaker 5>you know the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His cell phone will be like,</v>

207
00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:36.960
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what did you think we were saying?</v>

208
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:42.020
<v Speaker 5>That's what I thought would be smart </v>
<v Speaker 5>enough to be tired of listening to your </v>

209
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.820
<v Speaker 5>stupid shit that that's what I feel like</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the NSA.</v>

210
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:48.740
<v Speaker 5>It's whoever's monitoring what they </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking deserve.</v>

211
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.110
<v Speaker 5>Every fucking morning they wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

212
00:09:52.111 --> 00:09:57.111
<v Speaker 5>look at a garden and then go to watch </v>
<v Speaker 5>him jerk off fucking porn all day again.</v>

213
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:05.750
<v Speaker 5>Are you seriously idiot?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The idea that there is one person that's</v>

214
00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:10.850
<v Speaker 5>actually watching everyone </v>
<v Speaker 5>mathematically</v>

215
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.940
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that their store,</v>

216
00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:18.941
<v Speaker 1>but it is a dirty thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to just store everyone's everything in </v>

217
00:10:18.941 --> 00:10:21.740
<v Speaker 1>some database somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a dirty thing to do.</v>

218
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Tell people that you're doing it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It promotes this massive state of </v>

219
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.781
<v Speaker 1>paranoia almost instantaneously because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it without letting anybody </v>

220
00:10:31.781 --> 00:10:35.801
<v Speaker 1>know that you're doing it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're denying its existence and it's </v>

221
00:10:35.801 --> 00:10:38.621
<v Speaker 1>ultimately proved to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those things are very bad for </v>

222
00:10:38.621 --> 00:10:39.680
<v Speaker 1>public confidence and all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

223
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:40.290
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

224
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:41.320
<v Speaker 1>when they take place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's.</v>

225
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.180
<v Speaker 1>What's gross about it is that you did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

226
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.270
<v Speaker 1>You had the possibility to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's technological.</v>

227
00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:48.890
<v Speaker 1>That's unavoidable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you did it.</v>

228
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.440
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't just copied everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

229
00:10:51.441 --> 00:10:54.530
<v Speaker 1>It's stored it and then he had denied it</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it came out,</v>

230
00:10:54.531 --> 00:10:59.531
<v Speaker 1>like in principle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating trend because it's a </v>

231
00:10:59.531 --> 00:11:01.100
<v Speaker 1>trend of a disillusion of boundaries.</v>

232
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.830
<v Speaker 1>The connection between a person and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

233
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.980
<v Speaker 1>a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of information is becoming more </v>

234
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.040
<v Speaker 1>and more instantaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a google search with it's.</v>

235
00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I think that this is just a subtle </v>
<v Speaker 1>victim of this overlying trend in </v>

236
00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.540
<v Speaker 1>technology of bringing people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>information closer and closer together.</v>

237
00:11:17.541 --> 00:11:17.930
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

238
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.860
<v Speaker 1>it's almost unavoidable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just sucks that it had to be done</v>

239
00:11:21.861 --> 00:11:24.530
<v Speaker 1>by the people that are supposedly </v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting us,</v>

240
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.550
<v Speaker 1>supposedly watching over us like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

241
00:11:28.551 --> 00:11:29.840
<v Speaker 1>how old are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe?</v>

242
00:11:29.841 --> 00:11:32.840
<v Speaker 1>You don't believe they're protecting us </v>
<v Speaker 1>and watching over time,</v>

243
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.100
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who does?</v>

244
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:38.990
<v Speaker 1>But it's the narrative is the narrative </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the day propel that rent,</v>

245
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.790
<v Speaker 1>that narrative comes up every four </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

246
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
<v Speaker 1>It comes up in various speeches that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the president gives speeches and </v>

247
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.410
<v Speaker 1>people will pretend that drops news and </v>
<v Speaker 1>CNN legs are heroes.</v>

248
00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:56.630
<v Speaker 1>They pretend that these are legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were all on the mainstream news </v>

249
00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:01.321
<v Speaker 1>sources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you almost have to address it in a </v>

250
00:12:01.321 --> 00:12:03.961
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You almost have to at least pay it some </v>

251
00:12:03.961 --> 00:12:05.170
<v Speaker 1>service just to diffuse it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that?</v>

252
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Speaker 1>The NSA logo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

253
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:11.710
<v Speaker 3>flying around fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like not trying to pretend </v>

254
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:11.710
<v Speaker 3>they're protecting us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

255
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:16.151
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Put a evil octopus devouring Earth Vr </v>

256
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:16.850
<v Speaker 3>logo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>

257
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:17.990
<v Speaker 3>Snowden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

258
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:23.110
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking demon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Octupus cracking from space to space </v>

259
00:12:23.391 --> 00:12:23.960
<v Speaker 3>cracking.</v>

260
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine if there were space </v>

261
00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:30.810
<v Speaker 1>crackings?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if we had been all </v>

262
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.211
<v Speaker 1>this time we had never been found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the universe is literally like an </v>

263
00:12:33.211 --> 00:12:35.740
<v Speaker 1>ocean and it just takes time for one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those fucking flying fish to to realize,</v>

264
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.000
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can eat this one.</v>

265
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Just success up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Socking things out of the atmosphere.</v>

266
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:45.190
<v Speaker 1>We're like a speck of plankton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We find out we're actually in a notion </v>

267
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.310
<v Speaker 1>dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just water.</v>

268
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:50.820
<v Speaker 1>It's just the we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in some strange state and that's </v>

269
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:50.820
<v Speaker 1>the way emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

270
00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are less believable scenarios.</v>

271
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.140
<v Speaker 1>There's not real water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's dark matter water.</v>

272
00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is beyond our reach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

273
00:12:59.231 --> 00:13:02.200
<v Speaker 1>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's weird,</v>

274
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:03.680
<v Speaker 3>but it may,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's fake.</v>

275
00:13:03.681 --> 00:13:08.681
<v Speaker 3>Is that phony?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because that went flying all over the </v>

276
00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:10.811
<v Speaker 3>place and made me think I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just seems like I like it because </v>

277
00:13:10.811 --> 00:13:11.240
<v Speaker 3>people at the NSA or like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

278
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:14.940
<v Speaker 3>let's just fuck with a stoner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it.</v>

279
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.960
<v Speaker 3>They're already paranoid.</v>

<v Speaker 3>already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of shit</v>

281
00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:25.120
<v Speaker 1>gives fuel to the super paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the fucking I on the dollar bill.</v>

282
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.080
<v Speaker 1>All that weird Egyptian iconography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

283
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.940
<v Speaker 1>All that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

284
00:13:29.941 --> 00:13:30.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weirdness on,</v>

<v Speaker 1>on just money itself</v>

290
00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:45.190
<v Speaker 3>and it's hilarious because all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is,</v>

291
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:50.460
<v Speaker 3>but having been on your podcast enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>times and like rambled about free </v>

292
00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:53.020

<v Speaker 3>inevitably some loon will send a message</v>

293
00:13:53.021 --> 00:13:54.920
<v Speaker 3>or post something on my board that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I know I'm not upon of the new world </v>

296
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:04.210
<v Speaker 3>order,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's funny to think,</v>

297
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I what that Weirdo is doing to me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

299
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.540
<v Speaker 3>like it's all just this endless state of</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

300
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 3>we'll never figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll never figure out who's behind the</v>

301
00:14:14.801 --> 00:14:19.801
<v Speaker 3>whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is funny how easily people will </v>

302
00:14:19.801 --> 00:14:23.011
<v Speaker 3>assemble Ed Arctic bits of information </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that shit with Terence Mckenna </v>

303
00:14:23.011 --> 00:14:25.660
<v Speaker 3>being in the fucking CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you kidding me,</v>

304
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:26.920
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

305
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.740
<v Speaker 3>Terence Mckenna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mushroom Mckenna,</v>

306
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.780
<v Speaker 3>God of mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The CIA is like,</v>

307
00:14:31.781 --> 00:14:33.830
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's use this guy as well.</v>

308
00:14:33.831 --> 00:14:34.790
<v Speaker 3>Our spokesperson.</v>

309
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:14:35.331 --> 00:14:39.830
<v Speaker 1>there was a cia guy going around helping</v>
<v Speaker 1>with distribution of LSD.</v>

311
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of people that were </v>

312
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.281
<v Speaker 1>in the psychedelic community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their problem is that yawns statements </v>

313
00:14:48.281 --> 00:14:53.021
<v Speaker 1>about Mckenna have been dismissed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone who's listened to the </v>

314
00:14:53.021 --> 00:14:55.580
<v Speaker 1>recordings that has half a brain that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was joking.</v>

315
00:14:55.581 --> 00:15:00.581
<v Speaker 1>It was a sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about the alien </v>

316
00:15:00.581 --> 00:15:03.881
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and the mushroom and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom recruiting him as a </v>

317
00:15:03.881 --> 00:15:05.220
<v Speaker 1>spokesperson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he was talking about and I,</v>

318
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.990
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't heard that is yawns take on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is literal law.</v>

319
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Yawns take on the recruiting for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>FBI,</v>

320
00:15:11.421 --> 00:15:12.710
<v Speaker 1>which look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

321
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you have to look at is what is </v>

322
00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:17.740
<v Speaker 1>most likely?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

323
00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.920
<v Speaker 1>if that's your only piece of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I listened to that,</v>

324
00:15:18.921 --> 00:15:22.120
<v Speaker 1>most likely I would say that he's joking</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

325
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.490
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about the mushroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yon is one of those weird dudes that</v>

326
00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:27.850
<v Speaker 1>has been like researching this shit for.</v>

327
00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Did he say anything about Gordon Wasson?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knows.</v>

328
00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was in the CIA.</v>

329
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:35.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were some connection with Gordon</v>

330
00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.920

<v Speaker 3>talked about aliens.</v>

333
00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.740
<v Speaker 2>I think the CIA like seaworld.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not 100 percent evil.</v>

334
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.800
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is probably a bunch of people </v>

<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The train dolphins that really loved </v>

336

<v Speaker 2>dolphins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does it.</v>

337
00:15:56.241 --> 00:15:56.241
<v Speaker 2>Does it stop the institution from being </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to.</v>

338
00:15:56.241 --> 00:15:57.960
<v Speaker 2>Just because a few of the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are involved in it.</v>

339
00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:59.610
<v Speaker 2>You guys know about John Lilly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't think he does either,</v>

348
00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.370
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at it,</v>

349
00:16:14.371 --> 00:16:19.371
<v Speaker 2>most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most likely that's not what was going </v>

350
00:16:19.371 --> 00:16:19.371
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most likely.</v>

351
00:16:19.371 --> 00:16:21.300
<v Speaker 2>Terence Mckenna was a hippie and he uses</v>
<v Speaker 2>also one point,</v>

352
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:26.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his argument for saying that he was </v>

353
00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:29.751
<v Speaker 2>in trouble with the FBI and they got out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of trouble like seemingly out of </v>

354
00:16:29.751 --> 00:16:30.430
<v Speaker 2>nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if that's all documented by dentists</v>

355
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:35.440
<v Speaker 2>and Qa and terrence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they talked in depth about him turning </v>

356
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.470
<v Speaker 2>himself in and them offering him some </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a plea deal.</v>

357
00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis sent me the email.</v>

358
00:16:39.331 --> 00:16:41.070
<v Speaker 2>I could read it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have his permission.</v>

359
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:46.400
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Transport Canada was in </v>

360
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.441
<v Speaker 2>the fucking CIA know also is the data or</v>
<v Speaker 2>bi or whatever the fuck they can use you</v>

361
00:16:50.611 --> 00:16:52.980
<v Speaker 2>without you ever even knowing you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>being used.</v>

362
00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

363
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of peace corps people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

364
00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:58.870
<v Speaker 2>I think we're used as a listener.</v>

365
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really mean this.</v>

366
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who listens to Mckenna talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about cei talk about psychedelics.</v>

367
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who listens to that and is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>intrigued is a fucking idiot and I think</v>

368
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.330
<v Speaker 1>that includes people that are in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>CIA.</v>

369
00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:16.331
<v Speaker 1>People are in the FBI just because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were square on paper and just </v>

370
00:17:16.331 --> 00:17:18.230
<v Speaker 1>because you know they're supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>abide by the schedule.</v>

371
00:17:18.231 --> 00:17:20.390
<v Speaker 1>One rules of the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

372
00:17:20.570 --> 00:17:24.920
<v Speaker 1>human beings are individuals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals have autonomy,</v>

373
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.950
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least when it comes to their own </v>

374
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:29.950
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and you listen to a guy like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Terence Mckenna and you go,</v>

375
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:30.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's side do I take?</v>

376
00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:33.200
<v Speaker 1>The evil overlord that I fucking work </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

377
00:17:33.201 --> 00:17:38.201
<v Speaker 1>that pays my bills and couldn't give two</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucks about me or this psychedelic bard </v>

378
00:17:38.201 --> 00:17:42.940
<v Speaker 1>who might be onto about a million things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've never even considered once </v>

379
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:49.240
<v Speaker 1>might be correct about this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's preaching about psychedelic drugs </v>

380
00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 1>being the very why human beings</v>

381
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:55.190
<v Speaker 2>exist in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In our lack of use of them today is one </v>

382
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.460
<v Speaker 2>of the reasons why we're so disconnected</v>
<v Speaker 2>from nature.</v>

383
00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Like we just shot into space and then we</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost our cord that connects us.</v>

384
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.460
<v Speaker 2>We lost whatever the connection was to </v>
<v Speaker 2>how we got there.</v>

385
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Sounds ridiculous when it comes from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy like me,</v>

386
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:12.900
<v Speaker 2>but when you hear Mckenna talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's talking about climatological </v>

387
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.790
<v Speaker 2>changes and about how the hominids moved</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of the trees to experiment with new </v>

388
00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:18.090
<v Speaker 2>food sources as the rain forest receded </v>
<v Speaker 2>into grasslands,</v>

389
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:23.091
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is well documented shit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then also the positive attributes of </v>

390
00:18:23.091 --> 00:18:25.050
<v Speaker 2>Psilocybin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the increase in visual acuity,</v>

391
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:29.430
<v Speaker 2>the fact that it makes them Hornier so </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd get like monkeys that were Horny,</v>

392
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.520
<v Speaker 2>they could see better if they ate these </v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms and then the transcendent </v>

393
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.531
<v Speaker 2>experience that it comes from them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>like all those together can't be </v>

394
00:18:38.531 --> 00:18:38.531
<v Speaker 2>ignored.</v>

395
00:18:38.531 --> 00:18:42.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean the idea that it's not considered</v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily as the reason why we're not </v>

396
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:47.181
<v Speaker 2>monkeys anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only because enough people or too </v>

397
00:18:47.181 --> 00:18:50.211
<v Speaker 2>many people are ignorant about it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the propaganda involving these </v>

398
00:18:50.211 --> 00:18:54.981
<v Speaker 2>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been so strong that whether or not </v>

399
00:18:54.981 --> 00:18:55.590
<v Speaker 2>you believe that it's had any positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>input influence on anybody.</v>

400
00:18:55.591 --> 00:19:00.591
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't deny that that experience is </v>

401
00:19:00.591 --> 00:19:05.090
<v Speaker 2>fucking mind blowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like legitimately fucking mind blowing </v>

402
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.590
<v Speaker 2>to the point where if you've haven't had</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

403
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.340
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't believe it's possible and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then when you do have it,</v>

404
00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.910
<v Speaker 2>the world is never the same again </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you believe anything's possible.</v>

405
00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ignore that.</v>

406
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:22.310
<v Speaker 2>How could you ignore that as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility for cognitive enhancement </v>

407
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:25.820
<v Speaker 2>when you're looking at a primate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thinking thing that discovers this </v>

408
00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.360
<v Speaker 2>mind altering insanely powerful drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens to grow the fuck everywhere</v>

409
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.170
<v Speaker 2>in shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

410
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.710
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're following these.</v>

411
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.820
<v Speaker 2>The following.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These monkeys clearly tipping over cow </v>

412
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.851
<v Speaker 2>patties and pulling out worms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're experimenting with food sources </v>

413
00:19:43.851 --> 00:19:44.730
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this stuff was there and it was.</v>

414
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.030
<v Speaker 2>If they ate it and they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course that's the X.</v>

415
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:53.360
<v Speaker 2>There's a doubling of the human brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>size over 2 million years at directly </v>

416
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.691
<v Speaker 2>coincides with this receiving of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rain forest in the grassland and </v>

417
00:19:56.691 --> 00:19:59.961
<v Speaker 2>experimenting with all these new foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new foods or what do you think that it </v>

418
00:19:59.961 --> 00:20:00.870
<v Speaker 2>listens to that and I think it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

419
00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:01.920
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

420
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.990
<v Speaker 2>having studied this kind of stuff for </v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile,</v>

421
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:09.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm very hesitant to say that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would certain because everything </v>

422
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.950
<v Speaker 2>ends up being multilingual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>urea and out of other shit,</v>

423
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.650
<v Speaker 2>and I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a really interesting,</v>

424
00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.610
<v Speaker 2>here's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's the whole man,</v>

425
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:20.620
<v Speaker 2>the hunter thing so far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's a really interesting theory </v>

426
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.540
<v Speaker 2>that I don't hear spoken about much that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of corresponds to this a little </v>

427
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.440
<v Speaker 2>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same time period of course,</v>

428
00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:30.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were running under hot sun </v>

429
00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:33.891
<v Speaker 2>because of the receding forests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was savannah and one of the ways of </v>

430
00:20:33.891 --> 00:20:35.010
<v Speaker 2>hunting is to run the deer down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

431
00:20:35.011 --> 00:20:37.980
<v Speaker 2>Because we can persist much further than</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can.</v>

432
00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.860
<v Speaker 2>They're faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only over 200 meters.</v>

433
00:20:40.861 --> 00:20:42.480
<v Speaker 2>And then they get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't sweat.</v>

434
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

435
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

436
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.770
<v Speaker 2>so these dudes are running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hot,</v>

437
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 2>lots</v>

438
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:53.190
<v Speaker 6>of Sun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The brain gets overheated and so </v>

439
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:56.020
<v Speaker 6>evolutionary pressure is on creating </v>
<v Speaker 6>redundancy in the neural networks of the</v>

440
00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:58.120
<v Speaker 6>brain as a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as a,</v>

441
00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:03.570
<v Speaker 6>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as a sort of insurance policy against </v>

442
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:03.570
<v Speaker 6>overheating.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

443
00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:07.380
<v Speaker 6>And so what happens is we develop all </v>
<v Speaker 6>this surplus in neural tissue that then </v>

444
00:21:07.811 --> 00:21:12.811
<v Speaker 6>gets wired into one thing as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like having a spare tire and </v>

445
00:21:12.811 --> 00:21:14.200
<v Speaker 6>suddenly your car has now five wheels,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

446
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.660
<v Speaker 6>It like the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

447
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.630
<v Speaker 6>the evolution took advantage of this </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing that was made for something else,</v>

448
00:21:19.631 --> 00:21:21.700
<v Speaker 6>which is a very well known concept in </v>
<v Speaker 6>evolution.</v>

449
00:21:21.701 --> 00:21:26.701
<v Speaker 6>It's called a spandrel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's something that seems like it was </v>

450
00:21:26.701 --> 00:21:30.661
<v Speaker 6>designed to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in fact it's a byproduct of </v>

451
00:21:30.661 --> 00:21:30.661
<v Speaker 6>something else.</v>

452
00:21:30.661 --> 00:21:34.120
<v Speaker 1>And ultimately of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every result is a combination of things </v>

453
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.541
<v Speaker 1>coming together and creating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one thing that we think of as </v>

454
00:21:37.541 --> 00:21:37.541
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

455
00:21:37.541 --> 00:21:38.240
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

456
00:21:38.241 --> 00:21:40.550
<v Speaker 1>human consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evolved human consciousness.</v>

457
00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:44.300
<v Speaker 1>But when you think about all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible factors that came into play and</v>

458
00:21:44.301 --> 00:21:49.301
<v Speaker 1>all the different things that must have </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and selective breeding and how </v>

459
00:21:49.301 --> 00:21:51.620
<v Speaker 1>people figured out who to mate with and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how.</v>

460
00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's David Eick.</v>

461
00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.260
<v Speaker 1>David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

462
00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:56.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

463
00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:02.010
<v Speaker 1>I would like to have him on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think apparently he doesn't like </v>

464
00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:03.740
<v Speaker 1>talking about that lizard thing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking about the reptilian things moved</v>

465
00:22:03.741 --> 00:22:05.930
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feels like it's a distraction from what?</v>

466
00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe he's abandoned the idea,</v>

467
00:22:08.151 --> 00:22:10.790
<v Speaker 1>but I've heard he got mad at somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>for talking about.</v>

468
00:22:10.791 --> 00:22:12.290
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like a Jesse Ventura </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

469
00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know you get.</v>

470
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Might've got mad at Jesse Ventura </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think that was it.</v>

471
00:22:17.421 --> 00:22:22.421
<v Speaker 1>I think they got an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesse Ventura was calling him off raw </v>

472
00:22:22.421 --> 00:22:22.421
<v Speaker 1>hide.</v>

473
00:22:22.421 --> 00:22:22.421
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that.</v>

474
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:28.010
<v Speaker 3>I saw that episode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He like ambushes m and then he like </v>

475
00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:28.260
<v Speaker 3>really lets him have it and then it was</v>

476
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.060
<v Speaker 1>well uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

477
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:32.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

478
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.110
<v Speaker 1>there's a good point there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know when you,</v>

479
00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.740
<v Speaker 1>when you say something like someone's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Reptilian,</v>

480
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.650
<v Speaker 1>like everything else that you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to go,</v>

481
00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.150
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking you get you.</v>

482
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:48.180
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to show the first instance </v>

483
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:48.180
<v Speaker 1>of something that's able to change back </v>
<v Speaker 1>and forth.</v>

484
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.310
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just,</v>

485
00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

486
00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.100
<v Speaker 1>that's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just like you're a caterpillar,</v>

487
00:22:53.101 --> 00:22:55.250
<v Speaker 1>your butterfly know your counterpart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your butterfly,</v>

488
00:22:55.251 --> 00:22:57.710
<v Speaker 1>your batter fly you back to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>caterpillar to a butterfly.</v>

489
00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:02.950
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're saying that you can change back </v>

490
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.950
<v Speaker 1>and forth like there's nothing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

491
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.040
<v Speaker 1>That is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have a video.</v>

492
00:23:04.041 --> 00:23:05.780
<v Speaker 1>You got to have something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta you gotTa.</v>

493
00:23:05.781 --> 00:23:10.781
<v Speaker 1>Show me some fossils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just go around saying people </v>

494
00:23:10.781 --> 00:23:10.781
<v Speaker 1>are reptiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

495
00:23:10.781 --> 00:23:14.950
<v Speaker 1>you know you just can't do that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>then that means you're thinking sucks </v>

496
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:15.320
<v Speaker 1>and I can't trust you to be the guy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>

497
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.830
<v Speaker 3>But snakes used to be a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge problem for us.</v>

498
00:23:18.831 --> 00:23:20.240
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that why there's like.</v>

499
00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:21.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

500
00:23:21.771 --> 00:23:24.230
<v Speaker 3>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back then it was like a big fucking.</v>

501
00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.830
<v Speaker 3>Now snakes are a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're not going to run into a snake</v>

502
00:23:27.831 --> 00:23:30.110
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I'm getting coffee to starbucks,</v>

503
00:23:30.111 --> 00:23:32.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to like snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not gonna bite</v>

504
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:33.010
<v Speaker 6>pre,</v>
<v Speaker 6>pre.</v>

505
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:38.080
<v Speaker 6>If more than 5 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>snakes must've been such a problem that </v>

506
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:38.890
<v Speaker 6>humans,</v>
<v Speaker 6>chimps,</v>

507
00:23:38.891 --> 00:23:43.891
<v Speaker 6>and Bonobos,</v>
<v Speaker 6>infants all recoil at an image of a </v>

508
00:23:43.891 --> 00:23:47.251
<v Speaker 6>snake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even if Eskimos who were never going to </v>

509
00:23:47.251 --> 00:23:47.251
<v Speaker 6>see a snake,</v>

510
00:23:47.251 --> 00:23:51.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eskimo kids will freak out if you show </v>

511
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.901
<v Speaker 1>them a picture of a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That reptilian thing is like a </v>

512
00:23:52.901 --> 00:23:57.341
<v Speaker 1>reflection of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this weird residual neuro,</v>

513
00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:01.160
<v Speaker 1>a horror story that got imprinted into </v>
<v Speaker 1>our brains.</v>

514
00:24:01.161 --> 00:24:06.161
<v Speaker 1>And so now when people like David Eick </v>
<v Speaker 1>or just trying to make evil or </v>

515
00:24:06.161 --> 00:24:08.450
<v Speaker 1>categorize evil are in the book of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Genesis.</v>

516
00:24:08.451 --> 00:24:08.900
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

517
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:11.120
<v Speaker 1>what's the evil thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the serpent.</v>

518
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:16.310
<v Speaker 1>It's just a symbol that's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>embody ultimate evil.</v>

519
00:24:16.311 --> 00:24:17.500
<v Speaker 1>It seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

520
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:21.430
<v Speaker 1>every animal besides us is compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less they are compassionate,</v>

521
00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.210
<v Speaker 1>especially if other animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't.</v>

522
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:25.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not a part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

523
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.800
<v Speaker 1>not every animal other than those </v>
<v Speaker 1>dolphins,</v>

524
00:24:27.801 --> 00:24:30.020
<v Speaker 1>chimps and Bonobos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent ones,</v>

525
00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.180
<v Speaker 1>intelligent fox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

526
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.650
<v Speaker 1>you've met this dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

527
00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.070
<v Speaker 1>You've ever seen foxes were people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

528
00:24:37.071 --> 00:24:42.071
<v Speaker 1>they start living in the woods near </v>
<v Speaker 1>foxes and the foxes eventually gained a </v>

529
00:24:42.071 --> 00:24:43.610
<v Speaker 1>friendship and then they become like </v>
<v Speaker 1>their pets.</v>

530
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:48.800
<v Speaker 1>It's very common for foxes to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to become almost like dogs and </v>

531
00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.710
<v Speaker 1>become like really friendly with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

532
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.200
<v Speaker 1>ultimately what makes us human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the big things that makes us </v>

533
00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.651
<v Speaker 1>human is this insane level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding we have for what we are </v>

534
00:24:59.651 --> 00:25:04.391
<v Speaker 1>and what our places and constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing constantly either coming up </v>

535
00:25:04.391 --> 00:25:09.161
<v Speaker 1>with some way to justify it and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>self righteous position to take or </v>

536
00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:14.261
<v Speaker 1>coming up with some way to try to fix </v>
<v Speaker 1>the damage we've done or coming up with </v>

537
00:25:14.261 --> 00:25:16.190
<v Speaker 1>some where you're just trying to at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least understand it,</v>

538
00:25:16.191 --> 00:25:18.980
<v Speaker 1>but all those things are going on all at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

539
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Looking for validation is my idea right </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this anger at this guy in traffic.</v>

540
00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:27.200
<v Speaker 1>It's all this big sea of shit that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>on at the same time.</v>

541
00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.170
<v Speaker 1>So to compare that to anything else that</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists,</v>

542
00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:34.280
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's one of the weirdest </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals that we've ever seen ever.</v>

543
00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.580
<v Speaker 1>And it's us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

544
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.990
<v Speaker 1>It's the weirdest shit ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we didn't exist,</v>

545
00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:44.290
<v Speaker 1>if we like found us objectively found us</v>
<v Speaker 1>and started analyzing our impact on our </v>

546
00:25:45.501 --> 00:25:50.501
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ultimately colossally catastrophic </v>

547
00:25:50.501 --> 00:25:53.600
<v Speaker 1>effect of us even existing on everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else around us.</v>

548
00:25:53.601 --> 00:25:58.601
<v Speaker 1>Just to nihilists the ocean of fish to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where tuner coming back,</v>

549
00:25:59.301 --> 00:26:02.630
<v Speaker 1>radiated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's fucking a massive.</v>

550
00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Of garbage in the middle of the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the numbers of fish are down so </v>

551
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:10.850
<v Speaker 1>radically that people are worrying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>within 100 years there won't be any wild</v>

552
00:26:10.851 --> 00:26:15.851
<v Speaker 1>fish in the ocean anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Within another hundred years we've </v>

553
00:26:15.851 --> 00:26:17.970
<v Speaker 1>cleaned out getting wiped out all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the light.</v>

554
00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:22.130
<v Speaker 1>If we watched us from afar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>objectively,</v>

555
00:26:22.131 --> 00:26:24.500
<v Speaker 1>we would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

556
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:27.080
<v Speaker 1>this outbreak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is insane.</v>

557
00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Planetary athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's get that shit off of their </v>

558
00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:33.710
<v Speaker 1>super eight super eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just athlete's foot.</v>

559
00:26:33.711 --> 00:26:35.450
<v Speaker 1>There's no lamisil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get rid of people,</v>

560
00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.730
<v Speaker 1>but we do spread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

561
00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.130
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at it historically,</v>

562
00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:43.920
<v Speaker 1>you'd see these little sores and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>rashes spreading out.</v>

563
00:26:43.921 --> 00:26:44.080
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

564
00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're about to take over.</v>

565
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.590
<v Speaker 2>We're about to eat the host.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like before humans,</v>

566
00:26:49.591 --> 00:26:52.080
<v Speaker 2>Planet Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some disgusting.</v>

567
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:57.710
<v Speaker 2>Other people should have worn a condom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

568
00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.450
<v Speaker 2>Humans is herpes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

569
00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:06.270
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

570
00:27:06.271 --> 00:27:09.180
<v Speaker 2>or maybe we got offloaded or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

571
00:27:09.181 --> 00:27:11.870
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's just some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that was on a craft.</v>

572
00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:13.950
<v Speaker 2>So what did Mckenna say about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

573
00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:18.951
<v Speaker 2>Because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>along with the theory you were talking </v>

574
00:27:18.951 --> 00:27:18.951
<v Speaker 2>about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got the,</v>

575
00:27:18.951 --> 00:27:22.901
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mushroom spores going through the </v>

576
00:27:22.901 --> 00:27:24.360
<v Speaker 2>outer space because they absorb cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 2>rays and there they can last forever.</v>

577
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:29.600
<v Speaker 2>That to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the more compelling parts </v>

578
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:29.600
<v Speaker 2>of that whole thesis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got,</v>

579
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:29.600
<v Speaker 2>well allegedly</v>

580
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.800
<v Speaker 1>also the chemical composition of </v>
<v Speaker 1>silicide in the first place.</v>

581
00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:36.890
<v Speaker 1>So aside been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very closely related to a euro </v>

582
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:37.200
<v Speaker 1>trip transmitters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimethyltryptamine.</v>

583
00:27:37.201 --> 00:27:38.720
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

584
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to butcher the pronunciation,</v>

585
00:27:40.621 --> 00:27:43.710
<v Speaker 1>but it's something like for Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Ole oxy and,</v>

586
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.740
<v Speaker 1>and dimethyltryptamine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is literally like the same </v>

587
00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.120
<v Speaker 1>compound as a human neurotransmitter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mixed in with something else.</v>

588
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.080
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

589
00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.870
<v Speaker 1>this phosphorus in the four positions </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Fox for a lock,</v>

590
00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:00.890
<v Speaker 1>see whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only compound like that on the </v>

591
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:00.890
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they don't,</v>

592
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:03.720
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what the origins of it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

593
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:08.750
<v Speaker 1>They don't know where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that it couldn't have </v>

594
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.301
<v Speaker 1>been just a unique fungus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fungus is in and of themselves are </v>

595
00:28:11.301 --> 00:28:15.120
<v Speaker 1>incredibly fascinating and closer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>human than they are to plant funguses or</v>

596
00:28:15.121 --> 00:28:16.000
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there,</v>

597
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:20.070
<v Speaker 1>there are a strange sort of Karma free </v>
<v Speaker 1>life form there.</v>

598
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:25.080
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't hurt anybody and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>free shit literally eats shit and exists</v>

599
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:27.120
<v Speaker 1>in shit</v>

600
00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:32.530
<v Speaker 2>and isn't that and attacking really </v>
<v Speaker 2>attacking you or are you just had 30 </v>

601
00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:35.150
<v Speaker 2>hitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a dirty bitch,</v>

602
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.750
<v Speaker 2>found a good spot to live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can call me whatever you want,</v>

603
00:28:38.751 --> 00:28:43.751
<v Speaker 2>but that is definitely attacking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's to encourage cleanliness and </v>

604
00:28:43.751 --> 00:28:47.230
<v Speaker 2>encourage you to wash your balls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Balls we will grow and itchy tag does </v>

605
00:28:50.361 --> 00:28:51.230
<v Speaker 2>God's way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

606
00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:54.040
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more</v>

607
00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:58.250
<v Speaker 1>that there is no good or bad when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to the natural kingdom,</v>

608
00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:01.250
<v Speaker 1>you know that's much more of what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's Karma free.</v>

609
00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea that it exists on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your balls and it drives you crazy.</v>

610
00:29:04.491 --> 00:29:07.310
<v Speaker 1>It might be bad for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately in the universe just sort</v>

611
00:29:07.311 --> 00:29:08.150
<v Speaker 1>of balances out.</v>

612
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Know I met this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have a little itchy balls so </v>

613
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:13.760
<v Speaker 2>that it can live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got like pets on you.</v>

614
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.870
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're saying like is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>charity you should let because otherwise</v>

615
00:29:16.871 --> 00:29:20.540
<v Speaker 2>you're murdering your pets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like those guys in India who were a</v>

616
00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.210
<v Speaker 2>filter over their mouth so they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>accidentally inhale and insect.</v>

617
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.030
<v Speaker 2>They there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Jane's though.</v>

618
00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they killing anything,</v>

619
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:32.090
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know what they would do about</v>
<v Speaker 2>junket.</v>

620
00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:33.700
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

621
00:29:33.701 --> 00:29:36.070
<v Speaker 2>It's an interesting discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met a guy.</v>

622
00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:41.100
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about balancing out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met a really interesting guy in </v>

623
00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Mozambique last week and had dinner with</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

624
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:42.370
<v Speaker 2>He</v>

625
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:47.370
<v Speaker 6>has a thesis that each life has just </v>
<v Speaker 6>like you know,</v>

626
00:29:47.791 --> 00:29:48.390
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

627
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.850
<v Speaker 6>the conservation of energy in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>universe and energy's never made,</v>

628
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:55.690
<v Speaker 6>created nor destroyed everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>balances out in the end.</v>

629
00:29:55.691 --> 00:30:00.691
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So his thing was each life has a </v>

630
00:30:00.691 --> 00:30:03.670
<v Speaker 6>balanced amount of suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 6>pleasure and the more you suffer,</v>

631
00:30:03.671 --> 00:30:08.671
<v Speaker 6>the more pleasure you'll get somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 6>else and that these things always equal </v>

632
00:30:08.671 --> 00:30:12.920
<v Speaker 6>to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And our great mistake as a civilization </v>

633
00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.710
<v Speaker 6>is thinking we can increase the amount </v>
<v Speaker 6>of pleasure without compensating,</v>

634
00:30:14.711 --> 00:30:18.070
<v Speaker 6>without having an increased amount of </v>
<v Speaker 6>suffering as well.</v>

635
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:23.310
<v Speaker 6>And so we're running around chasing that</v>
<v Speaker 6>pleasure without realizing that we're </v>

636
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.310
<v Speaker 6>also accumulating and creating</v>

637
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.980
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

638
00:30:23.981 --> 00:30:28.981
<v Speaker 1>because the people that I know that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hardest time keeping it together </v>

639
00:30:28.981 --> 00:30:30.160
<v Speaker 1>emotionally are people that don't work </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

640
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's a coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people that I know that have the</v>

641
00:30:34.361 --> 00:30:36.620
<v Speaker 1>hardest time emotionally are people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't work out,</v>

642
00:30:36.621 --> 00:30:38.080
<v Speaker 1>and the people that I know that do </v>
<v Speaker 1>workout,</v>

643
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:43.200
<v Speaker 1>especially the ones that work out hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they expelled these big giant bursts of </v>

644
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.850
<v Speaker 1>energy where your body's like almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>

645
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.670
<v Speaker 1>You're heaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your heart's pounding,</v>

646
00:30:48.671 --> 00:30:50.830
<v Speaker 1>your chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're barely able to lift this,</v>

647
00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:55.900
<v Speaker 1>this piece of metal up again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Bailey able to jump on this box </v>

648
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:55.900
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're barely able to.</v>

649
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.960
<v Speaker 1>And by putting yourself in that intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of stress,</v>

650
00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.500
<v Speaker 1>it makes regular life more peaceful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the Yin and the Yang.</v>

651
00:31:02.501 --> 00:31:03.190
<v Speaker 1>You do see that</v>

652
00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:08.270
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when professional athletes are being </v>

653
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:08.270
<v Speaker 6>interviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like NBA Dudes,</v>

654
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:08.270
<v Speaker 6>they all seem</v>

655
00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.710
<v Speaker 1>so the highest flow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys are highest fuck.</v>

656
00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Those guys get high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They uh,</v>

657
00:31:12.391 --> 00:31:17.391
<v Speaker 1>they actually keep marijuana off there </v>
<v Speaker 1>or they did for a long time off their </v>

658
00:31:17.391 --> 00:31:19.890
<v Speaker 1>drug list of the things that get tested </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they all like to play stone.</v>

659
00:31:19.891 --> 00:31:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

660
00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:21.710
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hell yeah.</v>

661
00:31:21.711 --> 00:31:24.470
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's more fun than being a giant?</v>

662
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.620
<v Speaker 4>Throwing a bouncy ball around some </v>
<v Speaker 4>polished arena.</v>

663
00:31:27.621 --> 00:31:30.870
<v Speaker 4>That's a blast when you're high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think marijuana,</v>

664
00:31:30.871 --> 00:31:30.930
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

665
00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Gives you a certain sensitivity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

666
00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.880
<v Speaker 1>to things like it gives you a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity to art.</v>

667
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Like the art that you make gives you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain sensitivity to physical </v>

668
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:42.670
<v Speaker 1>movements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of guys love to do Jujitsu.</v>

669
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:44.770
<v Speaker 4>Can I throw something out here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

670
00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.880
<v Speaker 4>And when you get really high,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you kind of see things like become a </v>

671
00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.960
<v Speaker 4>little more orangy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that happened to,</v>

672
00:31:51.961 --> 00:31:54.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that does happen to me.</v>

673
00:31:54.181 --> 00:31:56.630
<v Speaker 4>Like when I get really high things </v>
<v Speaker 4>seemed to take on a,</v>

674
00:31:56.790 --> 00:32:01.790
<v Speaker 4>like a basket ball orange 10.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like that same kind of like the </v>

675
00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:03.520
<v Speaker 4>rose tinted glasses higher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get inside,</v>

676
00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:12.100
<v Speaker 4>you're scaring me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just sit across the table from Duncan </v>

677
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.150
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] Duncan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Normally you start getting high about </v>

678
00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.121
<v Speaker 4>4:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>PM and then the sun starts going down </v>

679
00:32:17.121 --> 00:32:17.430
<v Speaker 4>and everything gets golden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the sunset and dunking.</v>

680
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:18.390
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

681
00:32:18.391 --> 00:32:23.391
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I definitely got high before four PM </v>

682
00:32:23.391 --> 00:32:24.070
<v Speaker 4>orange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get.</v>

683
00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.420
<v Speaker 4>Well this whole room is already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's just shifted the light.</v>

684
00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:32.450
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're near your near this orange and </v>

685
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.191
<v Speaker 4>you're also near the orange of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember when I was in high school </v>

686
00:32:34.191 --> 00:32:34.670
<v Speaker 4>getting into conversation with someone I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>

687
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.580
<v Speaker 4>whether it was really stoned.</v>

688
00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see like orange dots everywhere.</v>

689
00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:42.740

<v Speaker 4>I thought he was my friend.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

692
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:49.730
<v Speaker 4>I've had friends that like legitimately </v>
<v Speaker 4>lost their mind.</v>

693
00:32:49.731 --> 00:32:51.140
<v Speaker 4>I can't talk to them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

694
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:56.230
<v Speaker 4>like you would talk to them about events</v>
<v Speaker 4>and his version of events were just </v>

695
00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:57.140
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so not what actually happened.</v>

696
00:32:57.390 --> 00:32:58.160
<v Speaker 4>Hailey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

697
00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.900
<v Speaker 4>this is the person that's lost their </v>
<v Speaker 4>marbles.</v>

698
00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:01.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

699
00:33:01.071 --> 00:33:06.071
<v Speaker 4>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can temporarily lose your marbles </v>

700
00:33:06.071 --> 00:33:06.071
<v Speaker 4>permanently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Agent or permanently.</v>

701
00:33:06.071 --> 00:33:06.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that like,</v>

702
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.120
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes permanently.</v>

703
00:33:08.121 --> 00:33:09.390
<v Speaker 4>Of course there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

704
00:33:09.391 --> 00:33:10.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying through psychedelics </v>
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>

705
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:16.990
<v Speaker 4>I know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just saying people that just can't keep </v>

706
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:16.990
<v Speaker 4>it together anymore and for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason,</v>

707
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:21.770
<v Speaker 4>whether it's a combination of life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stress and biological situation,</v>

708
00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.860
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck they got going on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

709
00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.250
<v Speaker 4>uniquely in their own brain.</v>

710
00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.130
<v Speaker 4>But some people just all of a sudden not</v>
<v Speaker 4>there anymore.</v>

711
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:33.190
<v Speaker 4>Not keeping it together too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think they're keeping it together </v>

712
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.190
<v Speaker 4>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

713
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's broad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>broad range,</v>

714
00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:35.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's all kinds of.</v>

715
00:33:35.451 --> 00:33:36.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it sucks man.</v>

716
00:33:36.621 --> 00:33:41.621
<v Speaker 4>People,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the brain is an organ and it </v>

717
00:33:41.621 --> 00:33:43.901
<v Speaker 4>malfunctions and sometimes he'd go nuts </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's stigmatized for it,</v>

718
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:48.950
<v Speaker 4>which really sucks because if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because that just adds to the problem.</v>

719
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.270
<v Speaker 4>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

720
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.390
<v Speaker 4>you see somebody in a cast and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

721
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:54.440
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened to your arm?</v>

722
00:33:54.441 --> 00:33:55.230
<v Speaker 4>And they'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

723
00:33:55.231 --> 00:33:55.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

724
00:33:55.821 --> 00:33:57.160
<v Speaker 4>I fell down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you,</v>

725
00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:02.230
<v Speaker 4>you talked to someone who's been </v>
<v Speaker 4>hospitalized for a few weeks and they </v>

726
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.070
<v Speaker 4>tell you I had to go to the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a nervous breakdown.</v>

727
00:34:04.071 --> 00:34:07.420
<v Speaker 4>I went crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My pants during my dog through a window.</v>

728
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.440
<v Speaker 4>You'll want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to be compassionate,</v>

729
00:34:12.441 --> 00:34:13.580
<v Speaker 4>but there's some part of you that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

730
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.980
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now this is a crazy person.</v>

731
00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:20.300
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's just something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The operating system temporarily crashed</v>

732
00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.630
<v Speaker 4>and quite often I think that can be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>very good thing.</v>

733
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:28.840
<v Speaker 4>I think that having your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your personality or your ego or crash </v>

734
00:34:29.841 --> 00:34:34.841
<v Speaker 4>can often mean that you were trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be somebody that you aren't and some </v>

735
00:34:34.841 --> 00:34:38.420
<v Speaker 4>people invest so much energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so much energy into trying to find him.</v>

736
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just want to be something.</v>

737
00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:40.840
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

738
00:34:40.841 --> 00:34:43.310
<v Speaker 4>they it since they were a kid there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mother was telling them,</v>

739
00:34:43.311 --> 00:34:48.311
<v Speaker 4>you should be like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then they try to be like this and </v>

740
00:34:48.311 --> 00:34:50.801
<v Speaker 4>they hold up this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're always working to hold up this </v>

741
00:34:50.801 --> 00:34:54.521
<v Speaker 4>giant tail feather in their arms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>start shaking and that they can't hold </v>

742
00:34:55.221 --> 00:35:00.221
<v Speaker 4>it up and that's when they have like </v>
<v Speaker 4>anger outbursts are suddenly like their </v>

743
00:35:00.221 --> 00:35:00.260
<v Speaker 4>friends are like you.</v>

744
00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.880
<v Speaker 4>You turned into someone that I've never </v>
<v Speaker 4>met.</v>

745
00:35:01.881 --> 00:35:03.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know who that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

746
00:35:03.471 --> 00:35:04.880
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is.</v>

747
00:35:04.881 --> 00:35:09.881
<v Speaker 4>You met them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You met underneath the tail feather the </v>

748
00:35:09.881 --> 00:35:13.300
<v Speaker 4>seeding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See the anger and disappointment and </v>

749
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.240
<v Speaker 4>sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they that you met,</v>

750
00:35:14.241 --> 00:35:18.230
<v Speaker 4>that thing that they're trying to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 4>by looking up at this mask,</v>

751
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:23.480
<v Speaker 4>they're holding up to the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that fucking ceiling see of </v>

752
00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.220
<v Speaker 4>disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anger and horror and sadness.</v>

753
00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.020
<v Speaker 4>That's where it's at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

754
00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.570
<v Speaker 4>You got to go into that thing and for </v>
<v Speaker 4>some people,</v>

755
00:35:29.571 --> 00:35:34.571
<v Speaker 4>the only way they can go into that is by</v>
<v Speaker 4>having a full scale nervous breakdown </v>

756
00:35:34.571 --> 00:35:36.260
<v Speaker 4>because then they can have permission to</v>
<v Speaker 4>dive into that,</v>

757
00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:41.320
<v Speaker 4>into that awful vortex of darkness </v>
<v Speaker 4>because underneath that vortex of </v>

758
00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:43.380
<v Speaker 4>darkness is paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Underneath that,</v>

759
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:48.710
<v Speaker 4>that's love and happiness and joy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>connection and tranquility and all that </v>

760
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:52.560
<v Speaker 4>stuff and everyone thinks that the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>to get to that point is by avoiding this</v>

761
00:35:52.561 --> 00:35:56.850
<v Speaker 4>awful black forest that surrounds the </v>
<v Speaker 4>garden of Eden,</v>

762
00:35:56.851 --> 00:35:58.160
<v Speaker 4>which is inside everybody.</v>

763
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.060
<v Speaker 4>It's inside everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's there,</v>

764
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:05.240
<v Speaker 4>it's there and it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know you can work out and that will </v>

765
00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.500
<v Speaker 4>definitely give you a temporarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>temporary good feeling,</v>

766
00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:12.890
<v Speaker 4>but until you address the internal </v>
<v Speaker 4>structures that you haven't </v>

767
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:15.771
<v Speaker 4>acknowledged,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're always going to go back to that </v>

768
00:36:15.771 --> 00:36:17.610
<v Speaker 4>place where you find yourself morose and</v>
<v Speaker 4>depressed and angry,</v>

769
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:22.700
<v Speaker 4>and you don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You always go back to that place until </v>

770
00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.570
<v Speaker 4>you sit with the sadness inside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to do that.</v>

771
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.790
<v Speaker 4>What you're describing is coming out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the closet.</v>

772
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:29.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a lot of people,</v>

773
00:36:29.041 --> 00:36:30.150
<v Speaker 4>that is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

774
00:36:30.151 --> 00:36:32.910
<v Speaker 4>It's coming out of the closet and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of closets.</v>

775
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.510
<v Speaker 4>There's not just the gay closet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's all kinds of closet.</v>

776
00:36:36.511 --> 00:36:39.630
<v Speaker 4>There's the artists closet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people are fucking accountants.</v>

777
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:44.720
<v Speaker 4>They're wearing suits and their ties on </v>
<v Speaker 4>tight and they're fucking organized and </v>

778
00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.500
<v Speaker 4>disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but inside they're probably painters.</v>

779
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:51.450
<v Speaker 4>They probably want to fucking paint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to paint Dayglo mountains down</v>

780
00:36:51.451 --> 00:36:53.040
<v Speaker 4>at the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they really are,</v>

781
00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:56.310
<v Speaker 4>but their daddy or their mommy wanted </v>
<v Speaker 4>them to be a good little businessman,</v>

782
00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.460
<v Speaker 4>so they became this thing that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>opposite of what they are.</v>

783
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.680
<v Speaker 4>This is the verse in the Bhagavad Gita.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

784
00:37:01.681 --> 00:37:03.480
<v Speaker 4>forgive me because I've quoted it way </v>
<v Speaker 4>too many times,</v>

785
00:37:03.481 --> 00:37:08.481
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's better to be an honest street </v>

786
00:37:08.481 --> 00:37:11.361
<v Speaker 4>sweeper than a dishonest king.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's better to be a happy guy brushing </v>

787
00:37:11.461 --> 00:37:16.461
<v Speaker 4>fucking leafs up the street than it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be some zillionaire who inside is </v>

788
00:37:16.891 --> 00:37:19.710
<v Speaker 4>dying or numb or miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mostly Numb,</v>

789
00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:21.520
<v Speaker 4>numbs the word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most people are just</v>

790
00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:26.620
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as these people can quantify on </v>

791
00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:27.230
<v Speaker 1>paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still have a x million dollar home.</v>

792
00:37:27.231 --> 00:37:31.340
<v Speaker 1>My car still cost x thousand dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This suit is an ex suit.</v>

793
00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:36.640
<v Speaker 1>I am still ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not going to abandon all these </v>

794
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.611
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as they don't see through the </v>

795
00:37:39.611 --> 00:37:39.611
<v Speaker 1>bullshit with the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think they're winning.</v>

796
00:37:39.611 --> 00:37:40.220
<v Speaker 1>They have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

797
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:43.460
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you have to fall to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

798
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:48.550
<v Speaker 1>That's what you got to appreciate those </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments when it all falls apart on you </v>

799
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:50.150
<v Speaker 1>because that means you've got an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to try it again.</v>

800
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:52.550
<v Speaker 1>This let's take a new fresh perspective.</v>

801
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.460
<v Speaker 4>This is a cool thing that at this </v>
<v Speaker 4>retreat I went to,</v>

802
00:37:55.461 --> 00:37:57.640
<v Speaker 4>this Guy Jack Cornfield said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I really loved.</v>

803
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:58.550
<v Speaker 4>What a great name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>

808
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:08.270
<v Speaker 4>he's really cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he was cool with the kids.</v>

809
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:12.100
<v Speaker 4>He's with our cat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the cigarettes and corny now.</v>

810
00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:17.140
<v Speaker 4>This guy was awesome and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things he talked about is in </v>

811
00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.460
<v Speaker 4>some religious tradition how they like </v>
<v Speaker 4>hold the scriptures a rabbi,</v>

812
00:38:19.461 --> 00:38:24.461
<v Speaker 4>like had his students hold the </v>
<v Speaker 4>scriptures over their heart and when </v>

813
00:38:24.461 --> 00:38:26.330
<v Speaker 4>they were memorizing them and they would</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

814
00:38:26.331 --> 00:38:31.331
<v Speaker 4>why do we do this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said so that when your </v>

815
00:38:31.331 --> 00:38:31.460
<v Speaker 4>heartbreaks they'll fall in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a beautiful idea,</v>

816
00:38:31.461 --> 00:38:36.461
<v Speaker 4>which is that heartbreak is actually </v>
<v Speaker 4>your ego cracking in the moment that </v>

817
00:38:36.461 --> 00:38:41.040
<v Speaker 4>cracks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're in the experience of truth and </v>

818
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:43.921
<v Speaker 4>when you're in the experience of truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when you can really become who </v>

819
00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:43.921
<v Speaker 4>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

820
00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:46.010
<v Speaker 4>but to get to who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like when you know,</v>

821
00:38:46.011 --> 00:38:51.011
<v Speaker 4>when a bone heals the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's what a lot of people's </v>

822
00:38:51.011 --> 00:38:51.011
<v Speaker 4>entire personality is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like</v>

823
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.160
<v Speaker 2>bone that grew the wrong way and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs a fucking,</v>

824
00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.140
<v Speaker 2>a snap or a crack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

825
00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.880
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get that through to,</v>

826
00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:01.190
<v Speaker 2>you need that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that initial fucking thing,</v>

827
00:39:01.191 --> 00:39:03.610
<v Speaker 2>and it's a beautiful analogy and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurts.</v>

828
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.190
<v Speaker 2>It hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're paying avoiding creatures,</v>

829
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:11.191
<v Speaker 2>so we think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're always running away from this </v>

830
00:39:11.191 --> 00:39:11.440
<v Speaker 2>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is as we're running away</v>

831
00:39:11.441 --> 00:39:12.030
<v Speaker 2>from pain,</v>

832
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:17.240
<v Speaker 4>we're still exactly in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's basically like being on fire and </v>

833
00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.771
<v Speaker 4>running away from water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just running away from the water </v>

834
00:39:21.771 --> 00:39:21.771
<v Speaker 4>because</v>

835
00:39:21.771 --> 00:39:21.771
<v Speaker 2>for some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

836
00:39:21.771 --> 00:39:24.030
<v Speaker 2>that's a stupid analogy actually for </v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

837
00:39:24.031 --> 00:39:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Up until that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of great points.</v>

838
00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.030
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

839
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:30.690
<v Speaker 2>there's the monster in the dark and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster you run,</v>

840
00:39:30.691 --> 00:39:35.691
<v Speaker 2>the more likely you are to run into </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's actually going to hurt </v>

841
00:39:35.691 --> 00:39:35.691
<v Speaker 2>you as opposed to turning around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

842
00:39:35.691 --> 00:39:37.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no monster monster.</v>

843
00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:42.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're never gonna know that until </v>

844
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.581
<v Speaker 2>you stop and turn around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some cases people don't have the </v>

845
00:39:43.581 --> 00:39:47.841
<v Speaker 2>discipline or the assistance or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls to stop and turn around so they </v>

846
00:39:47.841 --> 00:39:48.900
<v Speaker 2>have to trip over something and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

847
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.190
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a classic story.</v>

848
00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Classic story of someone hiding a secret</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going completely out of control </v>

849
00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:57.260
<v Speaker 2>because of the pressure of hiding that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

850
00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the Ted Haggerty who's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>secretly gay guy who's preaching against</v>

851
00:40:02.071 --> 00:40:03.330
<v Speaker 2>gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted Haggard,</v>

852
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Colorado.</v>

853
00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:09.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was snorting meth off his gay </v>

854
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:09.840
<v Speaker 2>lovers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

855
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:14.070
<v Speaker 2>Was just going so far the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just so off the rails.</v>

856
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Crazy himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's by himself.</v>

857
00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:19.050
<v Speaker 2>He was a guy who likes to snort math off</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Cox,</v>

858
00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:21.480
<v Speaker 2>the do a little math and he likes to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

859
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.270
<v Speaker 2>there's a few Cox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would say he wasn't being himself.</v>

860
00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:29.300
<v Speaker 2>What I would say is that his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his behavior was so extreme because he </v>

861
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:33.570
<v Speaker 2>was seeking balance between that and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other bullshit in his life.</v>

862
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.510
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if he weren't living that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd be right in the middle.</v>

863
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:37.540
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

864
00:40:37.541 --> 00:40:38.920
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to get to the middle,</v>

865
00:40:38.921 --> 00:40:43.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way to get to the middle weirdly is </v>

866
00:40:43.921 --> 00:40:46.051
<v Speaker 4>whatever the behavior is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing that you are so horrified about </v>

867
00:40:46.051 --> 00:40:47.980
<v Speaker 4>and terrified of sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're really weird ideas.</v>

868
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.430
<v Speaker 4>This is something that I liked that </v>
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda says,</v>

869
00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:53.110
<v Speaker 4>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't feel like meditating,</v>

870
00:40:53.111 --> 00:40:55.000
<v Speaker 4>don't meditate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't force it.</v>

871
00:40:55.001 --> 00:40:58.930
<v Speaker 4>Don't impose this on yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep doing the thing you're doing that's</v>

872
00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:02.020
<v Speaker 4>upsetting you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have the balls to keep doing the fucking</v>

873
00:41:02.021 --> 00:41:04.390
<v Speaker 4>thing that you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep doing it.</v>

874
00:41:04.610 --> 00:41:06.910
<v Speaker 4>Society is going to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't be like this.</v>

875
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.040
<v Speaker 4>Stop being like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to change.</v>

876
00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:11.830
<v Speaker 4>That's what your parents always say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea is like,</v>

877
00:41:11.831 --> 00:41:15.790
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sink into what you are right now.</v>

878
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:20.850
<v Speaker 4>Just be that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stop resisting exactly where you are </v>

879
00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:25.710
<v Speaker 4>right now is perfect and that's a hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth to grasp because you think right </v>

880
00:41:26.501 --> 00:41:27.070
<v Speaker 4>away you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

881
00:41:27.071 --> 00:41:29.800
<v Speaker 4>What about fucking Jeffrey Dahmer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is he perfect?</v>

882
00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.360
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what about the leopard?</v>

883
00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 4>When you're seeing a leopard rip apart a</v>
<v Speaker 4>creature?</v>

884
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.290
<v Speaker 2>Is that thing per.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a perfect moment?</v>

885
00:41:36.291 --> 00:41:38.360
<v Speaker 2>I think the lumbered fucks them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>kills them,</v>

886
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.160
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ducks do.</v>

887
00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Ducks or necrophilia acts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they fucking evil creatures?</v>

888
00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:45.050
<v Speaker 2>We think they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

889
00:41:45.051 --> 00:41:47.960
<v Speaker 2>they are made that Phil Robertson Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very famous person,</v>

890
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:53.270
<v Speaker 2>because he invented a call for grant and</v>
<v Speaker 2>now poor gay people have to hear that a </v>

891
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:55.580
<v Speaker 2>man's anus is not as good as a woman's </v>
<v Speaker 2>vagina.</v>

892
00:41:55.700 --> 00:42:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine if you made the choice </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a man's anus and you hear this </v>

893
00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.980
<v Speaker 2>fucking bearded Fashionista with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>camera on the Bandana?</v>

894
00:42:02.981 --> 00:42:04.700
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so weird.</v>

895
00:42:04.701 --> 00:42:09.230
<v Speaker 2>I never thought of that big bearded </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christian Bible sling and Fashionista,</v>

896
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.850
<v Speaker 2>and he tells you that your choice was </v>
<v Speaker 2>incorrect and in fact the woman's vagina</v>

897
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:16.160
<v Speaker 2>is the better choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The man's anus.</v>

898
00:42:16.161 --> 00:42:17.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on guys,</v>

899
00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:20.720
<v Speaker 2>but how can you say that if you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced it?</v>

900
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

901
00:42:21.941 --> 00:42:23.270
<v Speaker 2>I think he has.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

902
00:42:23.271 --> 00:42:26.630
<v Speaker 2>the balance theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's so outspoken on that issue,</v>

903
00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:31.840
<v Speaker 2>like most of these homophobes are </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're home jerking off to gay </v>

904
00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:31.840
<v Speaker 2>porn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

905
00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:35.160
<v Speaker 2>otherwise you just don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just doesn't actually matter.</v>

906
00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:35.930
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Already if you really care.</v>

910
00:42:41.251 --> 00:42:46.251
<v Speaker 2>If people are gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the care the two guys love each other </v>

911
00:42:46.251 --> 00:42:49.871
<v Speaker 2>and why are you against love?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only like love if it's a man and a </v>

912
00:42:49.871 --> 00:42:49.871
<v Speaker 2>woman like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck man.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Penises or a corkscrew shaped the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonders of nature.</v>

924
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.100
<v Speaker 2>Evil Nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Such a cunt and just such.</v>

925
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.500
<v Speaker 2>You're going to fuck and you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep it in there too.</v>

926
00:43:24.501 --> 00:43:27.580
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns into a route and you know why?</v>

927
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:30.980
<v Speaker 2>You know why dogs stay stuck together </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they have a bone?</v>

928
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:31.760
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

929
00:43:31.761 --> 00:43:32.190
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

930
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:37.270
<v Speaker 2>the head of the dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Penis blows up like a ball and it just </v>

931
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:41.020
<v Speaker 2>gives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The females can hold it so he can't get </v>

932
00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:41.090
<v Speaker 2>the ball out and it takes time for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ball to go down.</v>

933
00:43:41.091 --> 00:43:43.940
<v Speaker 2>So we can actually get it back out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're stuck.</v>

934
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.550
<v Speaker 2>What does that help?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything?</v>

935
00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:48.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most most penises have bone.</v>

936
00:43:48.861 --> 00:43:51.200
<v Speaker 2>I figured what the baculum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're so lucky.</v>

937
00:43:51.201 --> 00:43:53.840
<v Speaker 2>We're very unusual that we do not have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>penis bone.</v>

938
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.200
<v Speaker 2>If we had like a rhino horn that never </v>
<v Speaker 2>got tired,</v>

939
00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:02.440
<v Speaker 2>it would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be so many people that you'd </v>

940
00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:02.480
<v Speaker 2>have to climb over people to get where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to go.</v>

941
00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:06.680
<v Speaker 2>We would have to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>carry our own shit with us at all times.</v>

942
00:44:06.830 --> 00:44:11.830
<v Speaker 2>It would be really rude and then we </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have to meet in shit depositing </v>

943
00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:15.851
<v Speaker 2>spots and places where you get food and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd just be crawling over and people </v>

944
00:44:15.851 --> 00:44:16.360
<v Speaker 2>just fucking along the way with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>random.</v>

945
00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Never stopped on fracture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about that?</v>

946
00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can happen.</v>

947
00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:29.360
<v Speaker 2>Guys get broken dicks all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It bends badly.</v>

948
00:44:29.810 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 2>It actually starts bleeding and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to go to the hospital</v>

949
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.350
<v Speaker 1>and get it repaired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have like a big,</v>

950
00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:36.540
<v Speaker 1>strong crazy girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a volleyball player,</v>

951
00:44:36.541 --> 00:44:39.430
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you don't let her get on top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very important.</v>

952
00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Have a really strong woman like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta.</v>

953
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Be careful in sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that all right?</v>

954
00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.550
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

955
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.240
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those girls was too strong in the legs.</v>

956
00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:53.400
<v Speaker 1>Were strong in the ass and legs because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could squeeze to tight yoga </v>

957
00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.550
<v Speaker 1>churches to grow with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generate too much force if.</v>

958
00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Because if she gets on topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going crazy.</v>

959
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Some of them will be crazy.</v>

960
00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:59.430
<v Speaker 5>So a small volleyball</v>

961
00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:00.200
<v Speaker 1>players.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just a festival of propaganda.</v>

979
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

980
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:56.800
<v Speaker 1>parade and festival,</v>

<v Speaker 5>The ladies from the Star Ship </v>

999
00:46:41.371 --> 00:46:41.371
<v Speaker 5>Enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hello.</v>

1000
00:46:41.371 --> 00:46:45.750
<v Speaker 5>Welcome their friend bones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know him as Dr Mccoy just wrote a </v>

1001
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:50.191
<v Speaker 5>new book on Captain Kirk and the way he </v>
<v Speaker 5>was able to woo beautiful one in like </v>

1002
00:46:50.191 --> 00:46:50.191
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all coming up.</v>

1003
00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.290
<v Speaker 5>He</v>

1004
00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:54.550
<v Speaker 1>proved his point is that it's almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's scripted.</v>

1005
00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:57.280
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like simulation theory is </v>
<v Speaker 1>true and we're.</v>

1006
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:59.140
<v Speaker 1>We're living in a Goddamn Coen brothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

1007
00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does seem like that,</v>

1008
00:47:00.641 --> 00:47:01.810
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really does.</v>

1009
00:47:01.811 --> 00:47:06.811
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something beautiful </v>

1010
00:47:06.811 --> 00:47:08.881
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does feel like there's like a </v>

1011
00:47:08.881 --> 00:47:11.310
<v Speaker 1>narrative at work here and the only way </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can live that fake life as if it's </v>

1012
00:47:11.471 --> 00:47:12.880
<v Speaker 1>fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual,</v>

1013
00:47:12.881 --> 00:47:13.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1014
00:47:13.691 --> 00:47:15.700
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this puritanical ideal.</v>

1015
00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:20.740
<v Speaker 1>They've held up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not natural and they haven't been </v>

1016
00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:20.750
<v Speaker 1>really living in any way they've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be living,</v>

1017
00:47:20.751 --> 00:47:25.180
<v Speaker 1>if be freaks in this sort of a rebound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a way to balance everything out.</v>

1018
00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:28.930
<v Speaker 1>And I think that ultimately that's being</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed over and,</v>

1019
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 1>and over and over again</v>

1020
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.440
<v Speaker 2>to the point where it's not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>a viable option anymore.</v>

1021
00:47:32.441 --> 00:47:34.360
<v Speaker 2>Like powdered wigs aren't a viable </v>
<v Speaker 2>option.</v>

1022
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:37.810
<v Speaker 2>You can't wear a fucking powdered wig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1023
00:47:37.811 --> 00:47:40.730
<v Speaker 2>and you can't pretend you're this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1024
00:47:40.731 --> 00:47:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Rick Santorum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy that you know,</v>

1025
00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.510
<v Speaker 2>just as a good man who believes in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bible and doesn't want to see gaze,</v>

1026
00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:51.511
<v Speaker 2>get married,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to ruin the institution of </v>

1027
00:47:51.511 --> 00:47:54.601
<v Speaker 2>marriage with homosexual activity that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>been shunned upon in the Bible and </v>

1028
00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:55.980
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>with you cat?</v>

1031
00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:03.100
<v Speaker 2>What is in your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

1032
00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:08.130
<v Speaker 2>I keep waiting for it to get to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point where anybody who's got a big </v>

1033
00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:11.491
<v Speaker 2>problem with homosexuality is by default</v>
<v Speaker 2>admitting to their own homosexual life,</v>

1034
00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:15.310
<v Speaker 2>but I've been waiting 30 years for </v>
<v Speaker 2>America to go,</v>

1035
00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.290
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is too silly to be real.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Ronald Reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you kidding?</v>

1037
00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:21.580

<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1038
00:48:21.581 --> 00:48:24.970
<v Speaker 2>he's St Ronald and the seeds he planted </v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago.</v>

1039
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:27.250
<v Speaker 2>Even then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even then,</v>

1040
00:48:27.251 --> 00:48:31.890
<v Speaker 2>there was a lot for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you remember the criticism though</v>

1041
00:48:31.891 --> 00:48:36.891
<v Speaker 2>is pretty open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot of people that didn't </v>

1042
00:48:36.891 --> 00:48:39.631
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when he was not enough that </v>

1043
00:48:39.631 --> 00:48:40.060
<v Speaker 2>he didn't win 49 out of 50 states in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel election.</v>

1044
00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well listen man,</v>

1045
00:48:40.841 --> 00:48:42.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1046
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:45.160
<v Speaker 2>he didn't dominate the vast majority of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1047
00:48:45.161 --> 00:48:50.161
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean there was a lot of idiots back </v>

1048
00:48:50.161 --> 00:48:51.361
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the difference between the way </v>

1049
00:48:51.361 --> 00:48:52.621
<v Speaker 2>people look at them now and the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>people looked at him then now it's </v>

1050
00:48:52.621 --> 00:48:53.310
<v Speaker 2>almost all glowing when people talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about ringing.</v>

1051
00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:55.140
<v Speaker 2>I hardly ever hear any criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1052
00:48:55.141 --> 00:49:00.141
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear about Iran Contra and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicaragua and El Salvador and Oliver </v>

1053
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:03.100
<v Speaker 2>Oliver North Oliver and all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>craziness and you know.</v>

1054
00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point,</v>

1055
00:49:05.591 --> 00:49:10.591
<v Speaker 2>my point is that this idea that suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to wake up and realize how </v>

1056
00:49:10.591 --> 00:49:14.371
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous it is and it's Rick Santorum </v>
<v Speaker 2>is too ridiculous to be real fucking.</v>

1057
00:49:14.621 --> 00:49:15.880
<v Speaker 2>What's her name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sarah Pailin.</v>

1058
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:21.390
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am amazed that how flexible the </v>

1059
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:25.801
<v Speaker 2>reality muscles seems to be that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are willing to accept this stuff that </v>

1060
00:49:25.801 --> 00:49:27.810
<v Speaker 2>Frank Zappa was laughing about 40 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

1061
00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.760
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if they are accepting it </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1062
00:49:29.761 --> 00:49:31.870
<v Speaker 3>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that you watch these shows and F</v>

1063
00:49:31.871 --> 00:49:33.870
<v Speaker 3>and it creates the illusion of </v>
<v Speaker 3>acceptance,</v>

1064
00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:39.020
<v Speaker 3>but then if you if anywhere on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>internet or do you just see this </v>

1065
00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:43.221
<v Speaker 3>constant rebellion against that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>square,</v>

1066
00:49:43.261 --> 00:49:45.000
<v Speaker 3>mainstream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>homophobic,</v>

1067
00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:48.120
<v Speaker 3>angry personality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you watch Fox News and yeah,</v>

1068
00:49:48.121 --> 00:49:51.480
<v Speaker 3>you watch Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you watching anything on TV and it's</v>

1069
00:49:51.481 --> 00:49:52.770
<v Speaker 3>an illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1070
00:49:52.771 --> 00:49:55.470
<v Speaker 3>you watch the commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything's as big illusion.</v>

1071
00:49:55.471 --> 00:50:00.471
<v Speaker 3>You watch the commercials and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>people go in and buy a car and make it </v>

1072
00:50:00.471 --> 00:50:04.850
<v Speaker 3>seems normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems totally normal that people are </v>

1073
00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:04.850
<v Speaker 3>going in to get deeply in debt to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>banks.</v>

1074
00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:09.741
<v Speaker 3>That all seems incredibly normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then more and more on the Internet </v>

1075
00:50:09.741 --> 00:50:13.280
<v Speaker 3>you see like people rebelling against </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and showing how the bankers like </v>

1076
00:50:13.411 --> 00:50:18.411
<v Speaker 3>the whole system is this fucked up thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and emerging things like bitcoin which </v>

1077
00:50:18.411 --> 00:50:20.550
<v Speaker 3>are like slowly moving the energy away </v>
<v Speaker 3>from it.</v>

1078
00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:22.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what you mean.</v>

1079
00:50:22.141 --> 00:50:23.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's going to be a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1080
00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:28.730
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to be more like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a gradual shift is people just stop</v>

1081
00:50:28.731 --> 00:50:30.250
<v Speaker 3>watching TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1082
00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:31.890
<v Speaker 3>that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are just going to,</v>

1083
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:36.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I drive down the street billboards for </v>

1084
00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:38.180
<v Speaker 3>fucking like Amazon.com</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows,</v>

1085
00:50:38.181 --> 00:50:43.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like billboards for shows that aren't </v>

1086
00:50:43.181 --> 00:50:43.220
<v Speaker 3>really controlled by these big Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix.</v>

1087
00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:44.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1088
00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:45.200
<v Speaker 3>But isn't</v>

1089
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.850
<v Speaker 1>just another big network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1090
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:52.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if it's a network or </v>

1091
00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:52.900
<v Speaker 1>it's an international conglomerate or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

1092
00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:54.170
<v Speaker 1>It's big money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

1093
00:50:54.171 --> 00:50:56.290
<v Speaker 1>but you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's just the idea.</v>

1094
00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:58.810
<v Speaker 1>The reality is it's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1095
00:50:58.811 --> 00:51:00.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not right.</v>

1096
00:51:00.051 --> 00:51:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Because the media is a very different </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1097
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:03.710
<v Speaker 1>The media where you talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>

1098
00:51:03.711 --> 00:51:08.711
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about a very hard thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get into the medium you're talking </v>

1099
00:51:08.711 --> 00:51:11.771
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about an incredibly easy </v>

1100
00:51:11.771 --> 00:51:13.721
<v Speaker 1>for you to get into literally open to </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost anyone with an internet </v>

1101
00:51:13.721 --> 00:51:14.090
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make a youtube video.</v>

1102
00:51:14.091 --> 00:51:19.091
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't cost you a goddamn dime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a laptop that has a camera on </v>

1103
00:51:19.091 --> 00:51:19.091
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk into it,</v>

1104
00:51:19.091 --> 00:51:19.880
<v Speaker 1>you can make a youtube video that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1105
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:22.490
<v Speaker 1>that's a big change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not just a big change.</v>

1106
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.620
<v Speaker 1>That might be the biggest change in </v>
<v Speaker 1>human history.</v>

1107
00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:27.030
<v Speaker 1>It might be the biggest change in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkey to mushroom.</v>

1108
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Certainly since the printing press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the printing press was a major for sure.</v>

1109
00:51:32.331 --> 00:51:37.331
<v Speaker 1>Giant similar in the sense that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took the power of communication away </v>

1110
00:51:37.551 --> 00:51:40.340
<v Speaker 1>from very few and gave it to a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1111
00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 1>So we're in that sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the more fascinating things about</v>

1112
00:51:43.911 --> 00:51:45.350
<v Speaker 1>this is that there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1113
00:51:45.351 --> 00:51:48.320
<v Speaker 1>even if Amazon does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something online,</v>

1114
00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:51.370
<v Speaker 1>it's no better than justine who has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1115
00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:53.270
<v Speaker 1>45 fucking billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1116
00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Followers and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every video she'd put people like that </v>

1117
00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:58.490
<v Speaker 1>that just became famous through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

1118
00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:00.350
<v Speaker 1>Jenna marbles is another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1119
00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:03.620
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got like millions and millions and</v>

1120
00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:03.620
<v Speaker 1>millions of hits.</v>

1121
00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:04.470
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1122
00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:05.860
<v Speaker 3>Here's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's what it is because I,</v>

1123
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:10.870
<v Speaker 3>I've just been reading sheldrake's new </v>
<v Speaker 3>book science set free and he talks about</v>

1124
00:52:11.491 --> 00:52:13.980
<v Speaker 3>morphic resonance or something and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>know you have some.</v>

1125
00:52:13.981 --> 00:52:16.630
<v Speaker 3>I think you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're skeptical about sheldrake,</v>

1126
00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:21.650
<v Speaker 3>but it's like when you've just have tv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>TV is a tuning fork and when there was </v>

1127
00:52:22.471 --> 00:52:27.471
<v Speaker 3>no internet and it was just tv and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a depiction of here's what a family </v>

1128
00:52:27.471 --> 00:52:27.471
<v Speaker 3>looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what people tend to.</v>

1129
00:52:27.471 --> 00:52:32.241
<v Speaker 3>It's a corporation saying here's what </v>
<v Speaker 3>people do when they're healthy and that </v>

1130
00:52:32.241 --> 00:52:35.991
<v Speaker 3>creates a tuning fork effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like if you're watching it </v>

1131
00:52:35.991 --> 00:52:38.691
<v Speaker 3>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to either resonate with or </v>

1132
00:52:38.691 --> 00:52:38.691
<v Speaker 3>are in feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1133
00:52:38.691 --> 00:52:43.491
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a wife and a house and a car and </v>

1134
00:52:43.491 --> 00:52:46.551
<v Speaker 3>a job and that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in tune with what everyone else is </v>

1135
00:52:46.551 --> 00:52:46.551
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's an illusion.</v>

1136
00:52:46.551 --> 00:52:48.270
<v Speaker 3>That's never been what everyone else is </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>

1137
00:52:48.271 --> 00:52:53.271
<v Speaker 3>It's just what massive conglomerates are</v>
<v Speaker 3>sending out there either in the form of </v>

1138
00:52:53.271 --> 00:52:56.220
<v Speaker 3>hypnotic content that keeps you glued to</v>
<v Speaker 3>your seat.</v>

1139
00:52:56.221 --> 00:52:59.820
<v Speaker 3>As you watch corporations try to get you</v>
<v Speaker 3>in debt to buy cars.</v>

1140
00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:00.480
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1141
00:53:00.481 --> 00:53:01.560
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's generally,</v>

1142
00:53:01.561 --> 00:53:04.680
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the whole thing is just,</v>

1143
00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:09.681
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tuning all of society in a way that </v>

1144
00:53:09.681 --> 00:53:11.370
<v Speaker 3>society maybe isn't meant to be tuned at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1145
00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:14.670
<v Speaker 3>And so with the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you have all these different smaller</v>

1146
00:53:14.671 --> 00:53:15.840
<v Speaker 3>tuning forks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1147
00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:21.020
<v Speaker 3>your podcast is a tuning fork.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People tune in to the stuff that you </v>

1148
00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.340
<v Speaker 3>talk about and the different people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you bring on the podcast,</v>

1149
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:27.360
<v Speaker 3>send out information that causes new </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of tuning to start happening.</v>

1150
00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:29.850
<v Speaker 3>So that's why when you watch like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Huckabee,</v>

1151
00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:35.060
<v Speaker 3>you'd really feel like you're like </v>
<v Speaker 3>listening to somebody sing off key </v>

1152
00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:35.580
<v Speaker 3>because you're not resonating or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>resonating.</v>

1153
00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:37.470
<v Speaker 3>You've been tuned into a whole different</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

1154
00:53:37.471 --> 00:53:42.471
<v Speaker 3>which is what the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the major things the </v>

1155
00:53:42.471 --> 00:53:42.471
<v Speaker 3>Internet has done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1156
00:53:42.471 --> 00:53:43.080
<v Speaker 3>you get these communities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reddit,</v>

1157
00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:46.590
<v Speaker 3>you can get tuned into the reddit </v>
<v Speaker 3>frequency quite easily where suddenly it</v>

1158
00:53:46.591 --> 00:53:49.530
<v Speaker 3>all just starts making sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that is why the,</v>

1159
00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:54.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the duck dynasty guy or any of these </v>

1160
00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:54.550
<v Speaker 3>Weirdos who are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1161
00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.300
<v Speaker 3>who are just ultimately just angry </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1162
00:53:57.301 --> 00:54:02.301
<v Speaker 3>That's why they seem so fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or they play angry people on TV.</v>

1163
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:08.900
<v Speaker 3>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think a lot of these people </v>

1164
00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:08.900
<v Speaker 3>aren't even politics.</v>

1165
00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Dynasty guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Duck Dynasty guy has been given </v>

1166
00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:13.270
<v Speaker 1>speeches like that for years that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>biblical retreats and stuff,</v>

1167
00:54:13.271 --> 00:54:16.180
<v Speaker 1>he's been doing that for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This video is real stick.</v>

1168
00:54:16.181 --> 00:54:21.181
<v Speaker 1>He's not fire and brimstone God fearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian man who was living on the </v>

1169
00:54:21.181 --> 00:54:25.261
<v Speaker 1>wrong side of the law and Jesus at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time and then turned it all </v>

1170
00:54:25.261 --> 00:54:26.680
<v Speaker 1>around and wants to let everybody know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the evils of sin.</v>

1171
00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:28.960
<v Speaker 1>He's an old dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he is.</v>

1172
00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:34.260
<v Speaker 1>He's an old dominant loved name for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an old dummy to probably just one </v>

1173
00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:35.260
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sucked a dick and liked it.</v>

1174
00:54:35.261 --> 00:54:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Way Too much of someone sucked his dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's his favorite moment.</v>

1175
00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.350
<v Speaker 1>It looks back on his childhood and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned it into,</v>

1176
00:54:41.351 --> 00:54:41.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1177
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:47.090
<v Speaker 3>career.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet he was hunting ducks when it </v>

1178
00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:47.090
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet he was hiring that duck blind.</v>

1179
00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:48.620
<v Speaker 3>They're all liquored up in the moonshine</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ducks.</v>

1180
00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:54.050
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right when he came into like some guy's </v>

1181
00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:55.590
<v Speaker 3>mouth years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>out in the out in the swamps,</v>

1182
00:54:55.591 --> 00:55:00.591
<v Speaker 3>he saw what the call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a duck black duck and combined pleasure </v>

1183
00:55:00.591 --> 00:55:01.920
<v Speaker 3>and shame mixed inside of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1184
00:55:01.921 --> 00:55:05.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to kill jobs from now on </v>
<v Speaker 3>and never think about this.</v>

1185
00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:10.200
<v Speaker 3>She didn't see shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your Mother didn't see shit.</v>

1186
00:55:10.201 --> 00:55:15.201
<v Speaker 3>Your father didn't see shit if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>imagined.</v>

1187
00:55:16.361 --> 00:55:17.310
<v Speaker 3>That's really what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All.</v>

1188
00:55:17.311 --> 00:55:22.311
<v Speaker 3>It was just a duck psalm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get his dick sucked by a guy and he's </v>

1189
00:55:22.311 --> 00:55:22.311
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck that.</v>

1190
00:55:22.311 --> 00:55:22.640
<v Speaker 3>It didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't happen.</v>

1191
00:55:22.641 --> 00:55:26.530
<v Speaker 3>He to kill ducks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that something like that happen,</v>

1192
00:55:26.531 --> 00:55:28.170
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something like that happen,</v>

1193
00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:31.020
<v Speaker 3>but you know man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what you do with,</v>

1194
00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:36.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex at dawn creates a resonance where </v>

1195
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:36.060
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1196
00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:37.650
<v Speaker 3>it's a shame reliever.</v>

1197
00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:39.750
<v Speaker 3>It's a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reduce your man because your book,</v>

1198
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:44.990
<v Speaker 3>I think it has been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a compassionate book for </v>

1199
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:48.111
<v Speaker 3>people who are stuck in monogamous </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships and feel guilty about the </v>

1200
00:55:48.111 --> 00:55:51.420
<v Speaker 3>fact that they are attracted to other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and I like that.</v>

1201
00:55:51.421 --> 00:55:54.570
<v Speaker 3>Guilt used to be a normal guilt that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually considered like,</v>

1202
00:55:54.571 --> 00:55:59.571
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something must be going wrong with your </v>

1203
00:55:59.571 --> 00:56:01.011
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're thinking about fucking other </v>

1204
00:56:01.011 --> 00:56:01.200
<v Speaker 3>people and your book make shows like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1205
00:56:01.201 --> 00:56:04.440
<v Speaker 3>actually that's just nature happening </v>
<v Speaker 3>through you.</v>

1206
00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:07.890
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to feel guilty about it </v>
<v Speaker 3>or like something's off balance in you.</v>

1207
00:56:07.891 --> 00:56:12.891
<v Speaker 3>It's just completely normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean you have to go and fuck </v>

1208
00:56:12.891 --> 00:56:15.801
<v Speaker 3>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at least now you don't have to feel </v>

1209
00:56:15.801 --> 00:56:16.980
<v Speaker 3>like I must not love her anymore or she </v>
<v Speaker 3>must not love me anymore.</v>

1210
00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:18.720
<v Speaker 3>What's that have to do with fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>ducks,</v>

1211
00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:22.140

<v Speaker 3>That's the glue,</v>

1212
00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:23.700
<v Speaker 3>the glue that connects</v>

1213
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:29.520
<v Speaker 1>fucking ducks and in the sadness you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have for not wanting to be monogamous </v>

1214
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:34.020
<v Speaker 1>group keeps it all together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glue that holds the.</v>

1215
00:56:34.270 --> 00:56:37.830
<v Speaker 1>That's why you need to listen to Phil </v>

1251
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:27.950
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like doing standup or it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't like working for the UFC or </v>

1252
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:31.671
<v Speaker 1>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people were really nice that </v>

1253
00:58:31.671 --> 00:58:34.221
<v Speaker 1>worked on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They became good friends and they were </v>

1254
00:58:34.221 --> 00:58:34.221
<v Speaker 1>fun folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had fun,</v>

<v Speaker 1>when you have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that,</v>

1257
00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:42.510
<v Speaker 1>that that's like the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing about working on a show.</v>

1258
00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:43.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1259
00:58:43.471 --> 00:58:47.100
<v Speaker 1>You're with the same people all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately the product itself,</v>

1260
00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:48.490
<v Speaker 1>like you know what I mean?</v>

1261

<v Speaker 1>It's mindless entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1262
00:58:50.581 --> 00:58:54.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a competition of ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

1263
00:58:54.511 --> 00:58:56.760
<v Speaker 1>That's good to distract you if you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>up for some distraction,</v>

1264
00:58:57.180 --> 00:58:58.380
<v Speaker 1>but it shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's junk food,</v>

1265
00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:00.660
<v Speaker 1>junk food for the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that it's anything,</v>

1266
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:03.060
<v Speaker 1>nothing bad about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nothing good about it either.</v>

1267
00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:06.090
<v Speaker 1>There's no no reason to think that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to elevate anything in any way,</v>

1268
00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:10.530
<v Speaker 1>but it's better than arguing over how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much you going to pay for a container.</v>

1269
00:59:10.531 --> 00:59:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it is,</v>

1270
00:59:12.271 --> 00:59:15.480
<v Speaker 1>but there was real human drama and fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>factor that was undeniable.</v>

1271
00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:20.580
<v Speaker 1>People really shit their pants when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were forced certain stunts and stunts </v>

1272
00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:22.340
<v Speaker 1>and think ridiculous thing they had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

1273
00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:27.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a miracle fucked up for real and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was just talking to my good </v>

1274
00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:29.270
<v Speaker 1>friend David Horowitz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who will be,</v>

1275
00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.700
<v Speaker 1>we're going to figure out a day to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>him on the podcast.</v>

1276
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:33.140
<v Speaker 1>He was the executive producer of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>

1277
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:36.160
<v Speaker 1>one of the executive producers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and mack units and uh,</v>

1278
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.760
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about on the phone the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other day.</v>

1279
00:59:37.761 --> 00:59:39.290
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told them,</v>

1280
00:59:39.410 --> 00:59:40.670
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be honest with you,</v>

1281
00:59:40.671 --> 00:59:43.670
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad they ended the last season I go</v>

1282
00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:48.680
<v Speaker 1>because I think it was like on its way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to being like it was so wrapped up with </v>

1283
00:59:49.031 --> 00:59:51.260
<v Speaker 1>a stunt is getting more and more risky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way More.</v>

1284
00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1285
00:59:52.011 --> 00:59:57.011
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say risky because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be ignorant to say that I'm not a </v>

1286
00:59:57.011 --> 00:59:57.590
<v Speaker 1>stunt man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a stunt designer.</v>

1287
00:59:57.591 --> 00:59:58.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's dangerous and what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

1288
00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:01.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what just looks dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>was actually pretty safe,</v>

1289
01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:06.970
<v Speaker 1>but all I know is that it became more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were starting to get more and more </v>

1290
01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:07.310
<v Speaker 1>spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>

1291
01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:11.730
<v Speaker 1>they had these people attached with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bungee cord to a helicopter and the,</v>

1292
01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were like 200 helicopters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 200 yards away on this enormous </v>

1293
01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>bungee cord.</v>

1294
01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:17.810
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had,</v>

1295
01:00:17.811 --> 01:00:20.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their partner had an undo locks and when</v>

1296
01:00:20.691 --> 01:00:22.970
<v Speaker 1>they undid the locks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to find the right key,</v>

1297
01:00:22.971 --> 01:00:27.971
<v Speaker 1>like this giant ring of keys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they did it within a certain </v>

1298
01:00:27.971 --> 01:00:30.800
<v Speaker 1>amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person got launched off of this tree</v>

1299
01:00:30.801 --> 01:00:35.801
<v Speaker 1>like fucking 100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 yards into the air on a bungee cord </v>

1300
01:00:35.801 --> 01:00:36.920
<v Speaker 1>attached to the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>helicopter.</v>

1301
01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:42.340
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember they were describing the </v>

1302
01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:42.340
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1303
01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:42.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1304
01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:47.141
<v Speaker 1>we have to be careful with this because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to make sure that the people </v>

1305
01:00:47.141 --> 01:00:47.141
<v Speaker 1>don't pull the helicopter at a weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>angle.</v>

1306
01:00:47.141 --> 01:00:47.900
<v Speaker 1>That makes the helicopter</v>

1307
01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:53.850
<v Speaker 3>control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine as you're following the </v>

1308
01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:53.850
<v Speaker 3>helicopter just slices you in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hamburger.</v>

1309
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:54.520
<v Speaker 3>We did a lot of</v>

1310
01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:59.700
<v Speaker 1>just where people hung from helicopters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's really not that big of a </v>

1311
01:00:59.700 --> 01:00:59.700
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just hanging over water,</v>

1312
01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:00.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they fall,</v>

1313
01:01:00.351 --> 01:01:05.351
<v Speaker 1>they just land on the water and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not growing nearly as fast as it looks </v>

1314
01:01:05.351 --> 01:01:05.800
<v Speaker 1>like boosh though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the job,</v>

1315
01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just.</v>

1316
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:10.460
<v Speaker 1>It sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels weird,</v>

1317
01:01:10.461 --> 01:01:15.461
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to live and you learn a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot about human beings from shit like </v>

1318
01:01:15.461 --> 01:01:18.281
<v Speaker 1>that though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating because between that </v>

1319
01:01:18.281 --> 01:01:20.890
<v Speaker 1>and what do an MMA commentary a real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot about seeing people when </v>

1320
01:01:21.981 --> 01:01:26.981
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they're breaking like the at the </v>

1321
01:01:26.981 --> 01:01:29.471
<v Speaker 1>point where they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't tolerate anymore and they </v>

1322
01:01:29.471 --> 01:01:29.570
<v Speaker 1>give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a give up point that some people</v>

1323
01:01:29.571 --> 01:01:30.920
<v Speaker 1>have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people don't even have it.</v>

1324
01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Some people will never give up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just have this,</v>

1325
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:34.160
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whatever.</v>

1326
01:01:34.161 --> 01:01:36.650
<v Speaker 1>That give up thing is a part of them is </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken.</v>

1327
01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:38.690
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even consider it.</v>

1328
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:40.940
<v Speaker 1>They'll just march forward their face </v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging off.</v>

1329
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Is this Guy Diego Sanchez or fights like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1330
01:01:43.041 --> 01:01:45.290
<v Speaker 1>This guy might not be the most skilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>

1331
01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:47.060
<v Speaker 1>He's very skillful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might not be the most skilled,</v>

1332
01:01:47.061 --> 01:01:50.660
<v Speaker 1>but he's one of the most crazy in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to quit</v>

1333
01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:52.120
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is dangerous man.</v>

1334
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:56.800
<v Speaker 3>Did you see that video?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If those two guys at the spa who broiled</v>

1335
01:01:56.801 --> 01:01:59.380
<v Speaker 3>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you see that they broil themselves?</v>

1336
01:01:59.610 --> 01:02:01.380
<v Speaker 3>It's like a competition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like who can get in?</v>

1337
01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:02.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like a spa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1338
01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.530
<v Speaker 3>You could say in stay in the spa the </v>
<v Speaker 3>longest in this,</v>

1339
01:02:05.531 --> 01:02:09.180
<v Speaker 3>in this sauna and it's these two guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they like,</v>

1340
01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:09.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

1341
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:14.910
<v Speaker 3>it's an elimination process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are really disturbing pictures if </v>

1342
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:18.391
<v Speaker 3>you show them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like basically a one of the </v>

1343
01:02:18.391 --> 01:02:21.571
<v Speaker 3>guys died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he roiled himself this thing </v>

1344
01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:21.571
<v Speaker 3>because</v>

1345
01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.070
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't get out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't listen to his body broiled.</v>

1346
01:02:23.071 --> 01:02:28.071
<v Speaker 2>He just cooked himself like a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>lobster in there and I think one of the </v>

1347
01:02:28.071 --> 01:02:32.361
<v Speaker 2>guys survived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's just a picture of him you </v>

1348
01:02:32.361 --> 01:02:34.341
<v Speaker 2>can find if you google search,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like guys fried and sauna and I don't </v>

1349
01:02:34.341 --> 01:02:35.670
<v Speaker 2>know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like he's just laying there and</v>

1350
01:02:35.671 --> 01:02:37.890
<v Speaker 2>his whole body's rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1351
01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:38.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1352
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:41.660
<v Speaker 2>like you put a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lighter on a ant,</v>

1353
01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:43.920
<v Speaker 2>which God forgive me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did want when I was a kid,</v>

1354
01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.690
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just like that.</v>

1355
01:02:45.691 --> 01:02:48.330
<v Speaker 2>Like he just curled up and he's bright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blistered,</v>

1356
01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:52.650
<v Speaker 2>read really horrible because he wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>give up and what a dumb ass waited a you</v>

1357
01:02:52.651 --> 01:02:57.651
<v Speaker 2>die at a spa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He died with his slippers on massage to </v>

1358
01:03:00.050 --> 01:03:05.050
<v Speaker 2>slippers on rubber slippers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave you a fatal relaxation.</v>

1359
01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.850
<v Speaker 2>The Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking hero in my book.</v>

1360
01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Got Bald guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got He didn't give up.</v>

1361
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000
<v Speaker 2>Is An interesting thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see like people who rise to the </v>

1362
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:18.000
<v Speaker 2>occasion and people who doubt </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

1363
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.640
<v Speaker 2>you see them like fumble and stumble </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the pressure and some people </v>

1364
01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.271
<v Speaker 2>find a way to like get through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the more fascinating </v>

1365
01:03:26.271 --> 01:03:30.231
<v Speaker 2>things about watching anything that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition is that we wonder how we </v>

1366
01:03:30.231 --> 01:03:32.500
<v Speaker 2>would do in that scenario and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost always fall short,</v>

1367
01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:38.030
<v Speaker 2>so we're always in awe of the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>manages to get by all those people that </v>

1368
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:39.120
<v Speaker 2>are trying to drag them to the ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>and carry that ball across the line,</v>

1369
01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:44.700
<v Speaker 2>but with the list of things that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are afraid of consistently.</v>

1370
01:03:44.701 --> 01:03:46.050
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after death,</v>

1371
01:03:46.051 --> 01:03:48.300
<v Speaker 2>of course it's public speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1372
01:03:48.301 --> 01:03:50.610
<v Speaker 2>and here you guys are to Standup </v>
<v Speaker 2>Comedians,</v>

1373
01:03:50.611 --> 01:03:52.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I give public presentation.</v>

1374
01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:54.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>

1375
01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:59.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't know how it compares </v>
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline wise to hanging from a </v>

<v Speaker 2>Duncan,</v>

1385
01:04:22.241 --> 01:04:25.510
<v Speaker 2>have you almost died in a song once?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1386
01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:29.460
<v Speaker 2>but I had been drinking a lot and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>decided to have sex with my girlfriend.</v>

1387
01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:35.510
<v Speaker 2>We passed out in the sun and we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>alone and luckily I woke up somehow.</v>

1388
01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:43.190
<v Speaker 2>You guys are fucking lightweights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sad to say that it was exactly what </v>

1389
01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:52.360
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Ryan fucks like a man and she was </v>

01:04:54.781 --> 01:04:55.570
<v Speaker 2>a folly ballplayer.</v>

1391
01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:58.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm lucky I didn't break my Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was really powerful.</v>

1392
01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Strong athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rican volleyball.</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he's still alive.</v>

1395
01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.620
<v Speaker 2>A sauna is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll go.</v>

1397
01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:13.470

<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1398
01:05:13.471 --> 01:05:15.070
<v Speaker 2>And he's all rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's daddy Friday,</v>

1399
01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He broiled himself.</v>

1400
01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:21.740
<v Speaker 2>He themselves dying right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's probably dead already </v>

1401
01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:21.740
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's.</v>

1402
01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the scroll down right there.</v>

1403
01:05:23.591 --> 01:05:25.210
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's being removed from the sauna.</v>

1404
01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:29.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy got fucking cooked.</v>

1405
01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:31.690
<v Speaker 2>He got cooked to literally cook </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves for what?</v>

1406
01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:33.000
<v Speaker 2>A trophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably one.</v>

1407
01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.790
<v Speaker 2>At least $5.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>

1408
01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.440
<v Speaker 2>It's so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humans get lured into awful things.</v>

1409
01:05:38.441 --> 01:05:39.520
<v Speaker 2>I got to appear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1410
01:05:39.521 --> 01:05:40.690
<v Speaker 2>that is a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1411
01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Darwin award.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a Darwin award winner right </v>

1412
01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:45.720
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

1413
01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:45.720
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1414
01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.570
<v Speaker 2>we also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1415
01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:49.660
<v Speaker 2>if he won and it was like a million </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars or something like that,</v>

1416
01:05:49.661 --> 01:05:54.661
<v Speaker 2>and he was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would applaud him for his ability to </v>

1417
01:05:54.661 --> 01:05:54.661
<v Speaker 2>withstand extreme agony.</v>

1418
01:05:54.661 --> 01:05:59.610
<v Speaker 2>We somehow or another admire people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are willing to survive extreme agony and</v>

1419
01:06:00.681 --> 01:06:04.510
<v Speaker 2>the force of endurance races and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>for something meaningful though,</v>

1420
01:06:04.511 --> 01:06:06.880
<v Speaker 2>not for a million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1421
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:10.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's weirder this are dying in a super</v>

1422
01:06:10.421 --> 01:06:15.421
<v Speaker 2>marathon while those 100 marathons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 mile marathons and your fucking out </v>

1423
01:06:15.421 --> 01:06:16.930
<v Speaker 2>both Kinda dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1424
01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:17.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1425
01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean nothing against athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1426
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:22.260
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1427
01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:25.780
<v Speaker 2>I find all that kind of hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition,</v>

1428
01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:31.560
<v Speaker 2>meaningless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just read a very interesting book </v>

1429
01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.481
<v Speaker 2>called man's search for meaning by </v>
<v Speaker 2>Viktor Frankl who was in the </v>

1430
01:06:33.481 --> 01:06:35.890
<v Speaker 2>concentration camp in world war two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a psychiatrist and he said,</v>

1431
01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:41.250
<v Speaker 2>he said the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the how of anything is resolved.</v>

1432
01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:46.980
<v Speaker 2>If you find the why and what he meant </v>
<v Speaker 2>was you can survive anything if it's </v>

1433
01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:49.360
<v Speaker 2>meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's not meaningful anything,</v>

1434
01:06:49.361 --> 01:06:50.980
<v Speaker 2>we'll take you down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1435
01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:53.860
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful Book.</v>

1436
01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why the hell I'm talking </v>

1437
01:06:59.940 --> 01:06:59.940
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

1438
01:06:59.940 --> 01:06:59.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance,</v>

1439
01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:00.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he endured Auschwitz,</v>

1440
01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:01.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I find that,</v>

1441
01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:03.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's obviously incredibly admirable,</v>

1442
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.670
<v Speaker 2>but somebody is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you put yourself in that position.</v>

1443
01:07:06.850 --> 01:07:09.280
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to a friend in Africa and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he was joking.</v>

1444
01:07:09.281 --> 01:07:09.910
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1445
01:07:09.911 --> 01:07:12.820
<v Speaker 2>only white people die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bungee jumping and you know,</v>

1446
01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:16.330
<v Speaker 2>motorcycles jumping and all this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a white dude thing.</v>

1447
01:07:16.331 --> 01:07:18.260
<v Speaker 2>If I told my mother I died bungee </v>
<v Speaker 2>jumping,</v>

1448
01:07:18.261 --> 01:07:19.690
<v Speaker 2>or if someone told me my mother had </v>
<v Speaker 2>died,</v>

1449
01:07:19.691 --> 01:07:20.700
<v Speaker 2>bungee jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'd be like,</v>

1450
01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:25.240
<v Speaker 2>that idiot was bungee jumping you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't die from malaria or starvation</v>

1451
01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:27.250
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what have you,</v>

1452
01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:31.540
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a hack standup comedian.</v>

1453
01:07:31.541 --> 01:07:36.541
<v Speaker 2>Premise that's for black comics will </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about like camping,</v>

1454
01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:40.360
<v Speaker 2>that's a big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're terrified of bears and black</v>

1455
01:07:40.361 --> 01:07:45.361
<v Speaker 2>people don't go camping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the whole thing that like </v>

1456
01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:45.361
<v Speaker 2>white people go bungee jumping.</v>

1457
01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:48.040
<v Speaker 2>White people jump out of a helicopter </v>
<v Speaker 2>and ski down the side of a mountain.</v>

1458
01:07:48.041 --> 01:07:50.410
<v Speaker 2>So maybe he stole this from Dane Cook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1459
01:07:50.411 --> 01:07:55.411
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's probably an obvious </v>
<v Speaker 2>premise because it's true like a lot of </v>

1460
01:07:55.411 --> 01:07:59.761
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of parallel thinking when </v>

1461
01:07:59.761 --> 01:08:01.411
<v Speaker 2>it comes to the realization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you live in an incredibly dangerous </v>

1462
01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:01.590
<v Speaker 2>environment like Africa and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking at white people that are,</v>

1463
01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:04.450
<v Speaker 2>you're not looking for danger jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

1464
01:08:04.451 --> 01:08:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it seems to be.</v>

1465
01:08:05.891 --> 01:08:10.891
<v Speaker 2>It writes itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you can't like see how a </v>

1466
01:08:10.891 --> 01:08:11.950
<v Speaker 2>lot of people would come to the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion.</v>

1467
01:08:12.110 --> 01:08:17.110
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are fucking hang gliding and </v>

1468
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:20.771
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting those fucking wing suits and </v>

1469
01:08:20.771 --> 01:08:23.450
<v Speaker 2>flying to downtown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't even watch that shit.</v>

1470
01:08:23.451 --> 01:08:24.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

1472
01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:29.120
<v Speaker 3>did you see that video of the Gay Dance </v>
<v Speaker 3>Troupe and Alabama?</v>

1473
01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:34.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted it so awesome that they hired </v>

1474
01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:34.850
<v Speaker 2>by accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell the story.</v>

1475
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:35.240
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

1476
01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.460
<v Speaker 3>like they hired like some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1477
01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:42.870
<v Speaker 3>they hired like a gay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a female impersonator dance troupe to </v>

1478
01:08:43.631 --> 01:08:47.080
<v Speaker 3>accidentally for this parade and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1479
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:49.870
<v Speaker 3>they like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the name of the dance troupe?</v>

1480
01:08:49.871 --> 01:08:51.550
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what it was.</v>

1481
01:08:51.551 --> 01:08:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Something ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what's so funny is you have.</v>

1482
01:08:53.981 --> 01:08:58.981
<v Speaker 3>So here's what you have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have these like gay dancers and </v>

1483
01:08:58.981 --> 01:09:01.850

<v Speaker 3>combining that with interviews with an </v>

1484
01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:03.250
<v Speaker 3>angry mothers like my child never should</v>
<v Speaker 3>have had to see something like that.</v>

1485
01:09:03.730 --> 01:09:05.980
<v Speaker 3>She's clearly the Satanist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1486
01:09:05.981 --> 01:09:09.130
<v Speaker 3>She's like a pawn of the dark Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's an angry,</v>

1487
01:09:09.131 --> 01:09:11.500
<v Speaker 3>angry person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys,</v>

1488
01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:12.820
<v Speaker 3>they're just saying like,</v>

1489
01:09:13.250 --> 01:09:17.830
<v Speaker 2>they're saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1490
01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:21.000
<v Speaker 2>if this came to my town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would be fucking thrown money on them.</v>

1491
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:24.360
<v Speaker 2>It's just hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fabulous.</v>

1492
01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:26.760
<v Speaker 2>It's great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1493
01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:29.400
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're good to come on.</v>

1494
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:30.770
<v Speaker 2>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In,</v>

1495
01:09:30.771 --> 01:09:32.700
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the interview that they did with him,</v>

1496
01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:35.400
<v Speaker 2>they threw out like Alan Watts level </v>
<v Speaker 2>wisdom.</v>

1497
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:38.610
<v Speaker 2>One of them says at the end of the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>we just came to dance.</v>

1498
01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.370
<v Speaker 2>It's really beautiful and sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

1499
01:09:41.371 --> 01:09:45.750
<v Speaker 2>this white angry white ladies like at my</v>
<v Speaker 2>child will never be the same.</v>

1500
01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:51.340
<v Speaker 2>My child dancing cool Santa Claus outfit</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1501
01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1502
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:55.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really good.</v>

1503
01:09:55.890 --> 01:10:00.610
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she'd be laughing with her.</v>

1504
01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:03.570
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you why these people don't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>any weed.</v>

1505
01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:05.010
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1506
01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:07.670
<v Speaker 2>Weed is just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not really getting down there.</v>

1507
01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:14.320
<v Speaker 2>If we were high and we were at the side </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the road and that we are here and we </v>

1508
01:10:17.721 --> 01:10:18.900
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might join them.</v>

1509
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Fuck if I pull your shirt up and join </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1510
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:26.990
<v Speaker 2>that would be distracting them from </v>
<v Speaker 2>their work that they've obviously put </v>

1511
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.330
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being a heckler thinks he's funnier than</v>

1512
01:10:27.331 --> 01:10:28.470
<v Speaker 2>the comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1513
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:29.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they've.</v>

1514
01:10:29.881 --> 01:10:31.770
<v Speaker 2>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the other thing about it.</v>

1515
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Like that shit was choreographed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

1516
01:10:34.771 --> 01:10:37.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking people hired him,</v>

1517
01:10:37.081 --> 01:10:38.490
<v Speaker 2>didn't really know what they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting.</v>

1518
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:41.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like being a comic and you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>booked for a club and they go,</v>

1519
01:10:41.641 --> 01:10:42.990
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we expect you to work clean.</v>

1520
01:10:43.170 --> 01:10:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I expect you to know what the fuck I do </v>

1521
01:10:48.170 --> 01:10:48.170
<v Speaker 2>before you hire me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1522
01:10:48.170 --> 01:10:48.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1523
01:10:48.170 --> 01:10:49.260
<v Speaker 2>You either want me to do comedy or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't get to tell me what to do.</v>

1524
01:10:49.290 --> 01:10:50.750
<v Speaker 2>It's like when Ted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1525
01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:55.760
<v Speaker 2>the thing with Ted had Sarah Silverman </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she came out and did what Sarah</v>

1526
01:10:55.770 --> 01:11:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Silverman always does and then the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>day the head of Ted tweeted that it was </v>

1527
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:04.041
<v Speaker 2>the most God awful performance he'd ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen and he was embarrassed to have </v>

1528
01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:04.041
<v Speaker 2>invited her and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1529
01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:08.931
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how were you surprised that Sarah </v>

1530
01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:08.931
<v Speaker 2>Silverman says shit that's offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1531
01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.990
<v Speaker 2>what was her premise?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was she going on to,</v>

1532
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to talk about?</v>

1533
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just did her stand</v>

1534
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.410
<v Speaker 6>up routine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She did the thing talking about,</v>

1535
01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:16.890
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1536
01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.760
<v Speaker 6>adopting a baby with terminal illness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1537
01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:22.530
<v Speaker 6>that you haven't heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1538
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.280
<v Speaker 6>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1539
01:11:23.281 --> 01:11:23.780
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1540
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:25.800
<v Speaker 6>the whole thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love kids and you know,</v>

1541
01:11:25.801 --> 01:11:27.920
<v Speaker 6>she does it with her cute Sarah </v>
<v Speaker 6>Silverman thing,</v>

1542
01:11:27.921 --> 01:11:30.720
<v Speaker 6>but I love babies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they get older and then they get,</v>

1543
01:11:30.721 --> 01:11:35.721
<v Speaker 6>it's problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so there's so many kids who need </v>

1544
01:11:35.721 --> 01:11:38.900
<v Speaker 6>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to adopt children with </v>

1545
01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:40.700
<v Speaker 6>terminal illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so they die when they're seven or eight </v>

1546
01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:40.700
<v Speaker 6>and then I can get another one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1547
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:44.900
<v Speaker 3>he is great.</v>

1548
01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's obviously comedy,</v>

1549
01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:54.300
<v Speaker 1>like this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the grossest things </v>

1550
01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:54.580
<v Speaker 1>that's going on these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've actually started talking about this</v>

1551
01:11:54.581 --> 01:11:59.581
<v Speaker 1>on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a real problem with people </v>

1552
01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:01.330
<v Speaker 1>pretending that jokes are statements and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is your actual opinions,</v>

1553
01:12:01.331 --> 01:12:04.540
<v Speaker 1>like there's an art to sank fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1554
01:12:04.570 --> 01:12:07.810
<v Speaker 1>You don't really mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I know that you don't really mean it,</v>

1555
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:11.630
<v Speaker 1>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I do it all sense of comedy.</v>

1556
01:12:12.150 --> 01:12:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Duncan Duncan will call me up and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most ridiculous shit and I'll say,</v>

1557
01:12:18.071 --> 01:12:20.290
<v Speaker 1>well that sounds like a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Long.</v>

1558
01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:21.580
<v Speaker 1>How long have you been working with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

1559
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:23.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

1560
01:12:23.681 --> 01:12:26.090
<v Speaker 3>I've seen the error of my ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1561
01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:31.220
<v Speaker 3>hang in there for like five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when he got taken by the NSA to the </v>

1562
01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:33.370
<v Speaker 3>camp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the camp,</v>

1563
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:37.970
<v Speaker 3>that was fantastic on my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said that I've been taken to the camry</v>

1564
01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:43.010
<v Speaker 3>education education camp and then like </v>
<v Speaker 3>me and Brendan Walsh just sing songs </v>

1565
01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:47.200
<v Speaker 3>about how great the beaches just turned </v>
<v Speaker 3>into this like vapid big.</v>

1566
01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:49.180
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that like that.</v>

1567
01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:52.540
<v Speaker 3>It's what people forget is that it's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>intention,</v>

1568
01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:55.310
<v Speaker 3>the intention.</v>

1569
01:12:55.660 --> 01:13:00.660
<v Speaker 1>I think people feel like there's cheap </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughs that people get away with at the </v>

1570
01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:03.270
<v Speaker 1>expense of other people's feelings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why they don't like certain kinds</v>

1571
01:13:03.271 --> 01:13:06.590
<v Speaker 1>of of of jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agreed there's,</v>

1572
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:09.480
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a balance and there's.</v>

1573
01:13:09.481 --> 01:13:14.481
<v Speaker 1>There's off-color subjects that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely done hilarious and then </v>

1574
01:13:14.481 --> 01:13:18.231
<v Speaker 1>there's off color subjects that are done</v>
<v Speaker 1>crudely and it's almost insulting how </v>

1575
01:13:18.231 --> 01:13:22.341
<v Speaker 1>bad the material is and you're obviously</v>
<v Speaker 1>just doing it just for shock value and </v>

1576
01:13:22.341 --> 01:13:26.301
<v Speaker 1>we know the difference between the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a difference between someone you </v>

1577
01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:29.361
<v Speaker 1>want to listen to where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully considering what they're </v>

1578
01:13:29.361 --> 01:13:32.361
<v Speaker 1>saying and then someone who's just not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really either capable of or not willing </v>

1579
01:13:33.121 --> 01:13:38.121
<v Speaker 1>to look deep enough to get true insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when they both have to be accepted </v>

1580
01:13:38.121 --> 01:13:42.201
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you can't have one without the </v>

1581
01:13:42.201 --> 01:13:42.201
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a judgement for them.</v>

1582
01:13:42.201 --> 01:13:45.120
<v Speaker 1>You need shit comedy to compare comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need bad experiences.</v>

1583
01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I think the hack for life is far as bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences like the,</v>

1584
01:13:50.581 --> 01:13:54.150
<v Speaker 1>the sadness and the trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the happiness is just exercise.</v>

1585
01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking workout in a brutally hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and avoid all that depression.</v>

1586
01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Just get all that shit out of your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you get through a brutal </v>

1587
01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.860
<v Speaker 1>kickboxing workout or a Jujitsu workout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular normal nonsense.</v>

1588
01:14:07.861 --> 01:14:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm fucking leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1589
01:14:09.271 --> 01:14:10.330
<v Speaker 1>I've got my shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1590
01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:12.340
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're too tired to give it.</v>

1591
01:14:12.341 --> 01:14:17.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's just been choking me all night </v>

1592
01:14:17.341 --> 01:14:17.900
<v Speaker 1>leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1593
01:14:19.730 --> 01:14:24.730
<v Speaker 3>That is a shocking thing about exercise </v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes that I'm depressed and I </v>

1594
01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:27.290
<v Speaker 3>finally like drag myself out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>House and go to the gym and just run and</v>

1595
01:14:27.291 --> 01:14:30.080
<v Speaker 3>sweat and then I'm in my car and I feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

1596
01:14:30.081 --> 01:14:31.070
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

1597
01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:32.750
<v Speaker 3>That's all I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that it?</v>

1598
01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:35.270
<v Speaker 3>I just have to exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no chance.</v>

1599
01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a fucking bag of chemicals.</v>

1600
01:14:39.450 --> 01:14:42.370
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want the mystical payoff?</v>

1601
01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:44.570
<v Speaker 3>I want it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want it to.</v>

1602
01:14:44.571 --> 01:14:47.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like some part of when you realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>just how very simple it is,</v>

1603
01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:50.960
<v Speaker 3>some part of you will reject that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you want it to be complex.</v>

1604
01:14:50.961 --> 01:14:53.390
<v Speaker 3>You want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want it to be something like,</v>

1605
01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:55.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't want it to be complex,</v>

1606
01:14:55.890 --> 01:14:57.550
<v Speaker 1>just wanting to hurt less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1607
01:14:57.551 --> 01:14:59.570
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always doing that to you anyway.</v>

1608
01:14:59.571 --> 01:15:04.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a transformative process </v>

1609
01:15:04.571 --> 01:15:04.571
<v Speaker 1>throughout every experience that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have throughout your life.</v>

1610
01:15:04.571 --> 01:15:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Everything that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of get a balance on,</v>

1611
01:15:06.141 --> 01:15:08.330
<v Speaker 1>well now I know how to handle this </v>
<v Speaker 1>better this time.</v>

1612
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:13.750
<v Speaker 1>The reality of the situation is we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of requirements that </v>

1613
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:15.770
<v Speaker 1>our body needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs to move around.</v>

1614
01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:19.610
<v Speaker 1>It has to but doesn't it atrophies </v>
<v Speaker 1>because fairly useless,</v>

1615
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:24.910
<v Speaker 1>like you have to keep it leaving and </v>
<v Speaker 1>good food to really appreciate the </v>

1616
01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:26.720
<v Speaker 1>movement of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to push it really hard.</v>

1617
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:29.480
<v Speaker 1>He pushed it really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a drag racer,</v>

1618
01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:33.140
<v Speaker 1>like a race car that you could develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a race car.</v>

1619
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:36.200
<v Speaker 1>You develop it just by pushing it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing it and pushing it and it becomes</v>

1620
01:15:36.201 --> 01:15:41.201
<v Speaker 1>a race car or if you let it sit alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a really junky old shit box </v>

1621
01:15:41.241 --> 01:15:42.380
<v Speaker 1>that can't start anymore.</v>

1622
01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:44.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally it's almost that </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>

1623
01:15:44.930 --> 01:15:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you really have to push it </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

1624
01:15:47.001 --> 01:15:48.740
<v Speaker 1>because I'm thinking of hunter gatherer </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people,</v>

1625
01:15:48.741 --> 01:15:53.741
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are sort of the model for what the </v>

1626
01:15:53.741 --> 01:15:53.810
<v Speaker 1>body needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really push it,</v>

1627
01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.630
<v Speaker 1>but they move constantly moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>

1628
01:15:56.631 --> 01:16:01.631
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever gone hiking with pack and </v>

1629
01:16:01.631 --> 01:16:03.440
<v Speaker 1>go fucking workout?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real workout.</v>

1630
01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Like you start to like walking up hills </v>
<v Speaker 1>all day,</v>

1631
01:16:05.781 --> 01:16:07.940
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got fucking exhausted.</v>

1632
01:16:07.941 --> 01:16:09.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nepal,</v>

1633
01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:13.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy that he.</v>

1634
01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:17.120
<v Speaker 1>There's a show called solo hunters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys,</v>

1635
01:16:17.121 --> 01:16:19.030
<v Speaker 1>they take like these little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1636
01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:21.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's little gopros and attach them to</v>

1637
01:16:21.231 --> 01:16:23.690
<v Speaker 1>their rifle or bow and Arrow and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a camera with them.</v>

1638
01:16:23.691 --> 01:16:27.200
<v Speaker 1>They'd go out into the woods and hunt </v>
<v Speaker 1>bear and Moose and like crazy shit.</v>

1639
01:16:27.201 --> 01:16:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys,</v>

1640
01:16:27.841 --> 01:16:29.150
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remy Warren,</v>

1641
01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:34.240
<v Speaker 1>who's a world famous hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a vo two Max of a high level </v>

1642
01:16:34.611 --> 01:16:37.200
<v Speaker 1>endurance athlete and all he does his </v>
<v Speaker 1>height.</v>

1643
01:16:37.210 --> 01:16:42.210
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hunts 300 days a year constantly </v>

1644
01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:44.980
<v Speaker 1>walking around at high altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly walking around and hills and </v>

1645
01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:47.270
<v Speaker 1>high altitude carrying backpacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking hard work.</v>

1646
01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:52.330
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what if you were going to </v>

1647
01:16:52.330 --> 01:16:53.510
<v Speaker 1>hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's Chetty do you had to fucking</v>

1648
01:16:53.511 --> 01:16:55.820
<v Speaker 1>walk a lot and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting is not just like,</v>

1649
01:16:55.940 --> 01:17:00.940
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go to the animal place and go </v>

1650
01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:00.940
<v Speaker 1>shoot one of those fucking things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>drag it out of there.</v>

1651
01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:05.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean you got to find them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to track and we got to sneak up </v>

1652
01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:05.121
<v Speaker 1>on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially in the old days.</v>

1653
01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:09.251
<v Speaker 1>You had dog shit equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had like bows and arrows that you </v>

1654
01:17:09.251 --> 01:17:09.251
<v Speaker 1>made yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1655
01:17:09.770 --> 01:17:11.060
<v Speaker 1>beers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

1656
01:17:11.061 --> 01:17:13.910
<v Speaker 1>And you got to get close enough to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal to use that thing.</v>

1657
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:19.000
<v Speaker 1>And there's a common misconception that </v>
<v Speaker 1>like there were more deer back then and </v>

1658
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.700
<v Speaker 1>actually there weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more deer today in North America</v>

1659
01:17:20.701 --> 01:17:25.701
<v Speaker 1>than they've ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way more than like when Columbus first </v>

1660
01:17:25.701 --> 01:17:28.601
<v Speaker 1>got here because of management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because all of the different habitats </v>

1661
01:17:28.601 --> 01:17:29.570
<v Speaker 1>because a farm lands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thrive and farmland.</v>

1662
01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:29.760
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1663
01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:33.500
<v Speaker 6>because of the absence of predators,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which humans killed,</v>

1664
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:37.400
<v Speaker 6>it was just a stronger park in Africa a </v>
<v Speaker 6>week ago.</v>

1665
01:17:38.170 --> 01:17:43.170
<v Speaker 6>Intense place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really interesting place and I was </v>

1666
01:17:43.170 --> 01:17:45.581
<v Speaker 6>thinking about that very issue of like </v>
<v Speaker 6>how because you drove Kruger park is </v>

1667
01:17:45.581 --> 01:17:45.581
<v Speaker 6>this big area.</v>

1668
01:17:45.581 --> 01:17:45.890
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1669
01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:47.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how big it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1670
01:17:47.231 --> 01:17:49.870
<v Speaker 1>it's like a county size or bigger</v>

1671
01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:53.470
<v Speaker 6>and they're just dirt roads and you just</v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of drive around and the deal is you</v>

1672
01:17:53.471 --> 01:17:58.471
<v Speaker 6>can never get out of your car because </v>
<v Speaker 6>there are leopards and lions and all </v>

1673
01:17:58.471 --> 01:18:00.400
<v Speaker 6>sorts of crocs and shit everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you see a lot of stuff.</v>

1674
01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:05.460
<v Speaker 6>I mean there we saw during the day we </v>
<v Speaker 6>probably sold five or six lions just </v>

1675
01:18:05.460 --> 01:18:07.300
<v Speaker 6>along the side of one of these roads,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dirt roads.</v>

1676
01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.240
<v Speaker 6>So if there are five or six lines just </v>
<v Speaker 6>along the road,</v>

1677
01:18:10.241 --> 01:18:13.130
<v Speaker 6>how many lions are there in that place?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1678
01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:15.790
<v Speaker 6>it's like there's a lion every hundred </v>
<v Speaker 6>meters along the road.</v>

1679
01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:20.791
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many fucking lines going a place </v>

1680
01:18:20.791 --> 01:18:21.620
<v Speaker 6>like that support of all my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're the most likely to get eaten by</v>

1681
01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:24.170
<v Speaker 1>an animal and just realized that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1682
01:18:24.171 --> 01:18:29.171
<v Speaker 1>did you know that in in those areas of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the South Africa especially like a lot </v>

1683
01:18:29.511 --> 01:18:31.870
<v Speaker 1>of those places where wild animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist,</v>

1684
01:18:31.871 --> 01:18:33.300
<v Speaker 1>they're fenced in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1685
01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:38.000
<v Speaker 1>that is a lot of what they call high </v>
<v Speaker 1>fence hunting operations in South Africa</v>

1686
01:18:38.001 --> 01:18:42.620
<v Speaker 1>because it's a dirty secret about Africa</v>
<v Speaker 1>and about a lot of North America,</v>

1687
01:18:42.621 --> 01:18:44.900
<v Speaker 1>but even more dirty about Africa because</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>

1688
01:18:44.901 --> 01:18:49.901
<v Speaker 1>a lot of his trophy hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of money that people pay to </v>

1689
01:18:49.901 --> 01:18:54.101
<v Speaker 1>go hunting over there is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's responsible for a great deal of </v>

1690
01:18:54.101 --> 01:18:55.910
<v Speaker 1>the money that's used for conservation </v>
<v Speaker 1>efforts.</v>

1691
01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Like there's also for importing animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they've.</v>

1692
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:04.990
<v Speaker 1>There's more a lot of African animals in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas than there are in Africa because </v>

1693
01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:10.420
<v Speaker 1>in Texas they bring them to these wild </v>
<v Speaker 1>wild hunting ranches like thousands and </v>

1694
01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.920
<v Speaker 1>thousands of acres and they just have </v>
<v Speaker 1>these deer just live there.</v>

1695
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:17.200
<v Speaker 1>They just live in Texas now and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>just live off the land and then they,</v>

1696
01:19:17.201 --> 01:19:22.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take guided trips to go and hunt </v>

1697
01:19:22.201 --> 01:19:24.251
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have African wild animals that </v>

1698
01:19:24.251 --> 01:19:25.610
<v Speaker 1>are running around like Sitka deer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit running around,</v>

1699
01:19:25.611 --> 01:19:28.010
<v Speaker 1>access deer running around in Texas.</v>

1700
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:32.240
<v Speaker 1>It's weird with these people who paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>for like hunting licenses,</v>

1701
01:19:32.390 --> 01:19:37.390
<v Speaker 1>they go over and I mean it's Kinda crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was a piece on how cowardly </v>

1702
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:42.071
<v Speaker 1>it is to hunt alliance like someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed it on this website because </v>

1703
01:19:42.071 --> 01:19:45.191
<v Speaker 1>they're just sitting there like all you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do is you run up to the difference </v>

1704
01:19:45.191 --> 01:19:48.311
<v Speaker 1>between a normal day in a day where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>car shoots them is that a metal stick </v>

1705
01:19:48.591 --> 01:19:50.420
<v Speaker 1>comes out and then all of a sudden their</v>
<v Speaker 1>life ends.</v>

1706
01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:52.670
<v Speaker 1>So they're just sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea.</v>

1707
01:19:52.671 --> 01:19:57.671
<v Speaker 1>You're a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no idea that this is a game </v>

1708
01:19:57.671 --> 01:19:57.671
<v Speaker 1>that we're playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to shoot the line.</v>

1709
01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:01.430
<v Speaker 1>They're just just sitting there chilling</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then someone comes along.</v>

1710
01:20:01.431 --> 01:20:03.530
<v Speaker 1>We'll isolate lion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's kind of fucked,</v>

1711
01:20:03.590 --> 01:20:08.590
<v Speaker 1>but people want to be able to say that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they killed a line as if there were </v>

1712
01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:08.590
<v Speaker 1>danger</v>

1713
01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:08.950
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1714
01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:10.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are doing.</v>

1715
01:20:10.411 --> 01:20:15.411

<v Speaker 2>hemingway.</v>

1725
01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:48.900

<v Speaker 2>That was pretty fascinating.</v>

1726
01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:54.680

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1728
01:20:56.690 --> 01:20:58.610
<v Speaker 2>just the idea of meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hemingway,</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just getting drunk with them.</v>

1730
01:21:00.270 --> 01:21:03.270
<v Speaker 2>Some people live like really live man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people were like,</v>

1731
01:21:03.271 --> 01:21:06.930
<v Speaker 2>when I hear your stories about African,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you've been everywhere,</v>

1732
01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:08.090
<v Speaker 2>listen to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woe is me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You just got back from a fucking treat </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Rom Dawson.</v>

1734
01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:13.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel so silly.</v>

1735
01:21:13.171 --> 01:21:14.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel woe is me,</v>

1736
01:21:14.851 --> 01:21:17.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying like when I was there </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was at that retreat,</v>

1737
01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:21.090
<v Speaker 2>and by the way that's not like in Africa</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no lions there,</v>

1738
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:27.350
<v Speaker 2>cougars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like they're more with crystals.</v>

1739
01:21:28.370 --> 01:21:29.940
<v Speaker 2>But when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was um,</v>

1740
01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:31.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was there,</v>

1741
01:21:31.141 --> 01:21:33.580
<v Speaker 2>you would run into people who all they </v>
<v Speaker 2>do is just travel.</v>

1742
01:21:33.581 --> 01:21:38.581
<v Speaker 2>They figured out how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just travel around the world and </v>

1743
01:21:38.581 --> 01:21:38.970
<v Speaker 2>you're Kinda like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you still make a traveler?</v>

1744
01:21:38.971 --> 01:21:41.130
<v Speaker 2>You see you were just in Africa?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1745
01:21:41.131 --> 01:21:43.800
<v Speaker 2>but I was there because my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife's daughter was getting married.</v>

1746
01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:46.490
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I didn't go to Africa.</v>

1747
01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.720

<v Speaker 2>for 15,</v>

1748
01:21:48.721 --> 01:21:49.710
<v Speaker 2>20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1749
01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:54.860
<v Speaker 2>the thing that most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most meaningful for me was movement and </v>

1750
01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:55.470
<v Speaker 2>travel and seeing new cultures and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1751
01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:57.210
<v Speaker 2>So like you're talking about backpacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1752
01:21:57.211 --> 01:21:59.430
<v Speaker 2>I wear a backpack for 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>well you're the real deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

1754
01:22:00.691 --> 01:22:05.691
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a guy who really made that </v>

1755
01:22:05.691 --> 01:22:05.760
<v Speaker 2>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a guy like,</v>

1756
01:22:05.761 --> 01:22:06.660
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

1757
01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.760

<v Speaker 2>experiences in a bunch of adventures.</v>

1758
01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.610
<v Speaker 2>But just like anything else,</v>

1760
01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:16.030
<v Speaker 2>and it started to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1761
01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:21.031
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another stamp in my passport really </v>

1762
01:22:21.031 --> 01:22:22.230
<v Speaker 2>doesn't fucking matter anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a real gift for podcasting.</v>

1763
01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:27.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you're willing to take if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a gift for the narrative that may </v>

1764
01:22:27.361 --> 01:22:32.361
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>may not come through in just a printed </v>

1765
01:22:32.361 --> 01:22:34.160
<v Speaker 2>word as much because he can't hear you </v>
<v Speaker 2>say it right now.</v>

1766
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:37.230
<v Speaker 2>There's this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just the thoughts that you say,</v>

1767
01:22:37.231 --> 01:22:40.500
<v Speaker 2>it's how you say it and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were very good at it,</v>

1768
01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:43.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the idea that you didn't do it before</v>

1769
01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:48.260
<v Speaker 2>and now that you have done it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the idea that you're going to just </v>

1770
01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:48.300
<v Speaker 2>travel around the world and not give us </v>
<v Speaker 2>fresh podcasts,</v>

1771
01:22:48.690 --> 01:22:50.100
<v Speaker 2>people's like this bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

1772
01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:52.830
<v Speaker 2>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1773
01:22:52.831 --> 01:22:55.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm really glad you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy who got me into it is Duncan.</v>

1774
01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean Danielle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ellie,</v>

1775
01:22:57.390 --> 01:23:02.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm really glad he's doing it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a cool thing and I'm glad you're </v>

1776
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.390
<v Speaker 2>doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1777
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:06.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's podcasting is one of the and most,</v>

1778
01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:06.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1779
01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:10.930
<v Speaker 1>fascinating entrance into the world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>medium that's ever existed.</v>

1780
01:23:10.931 --> 01:23:15.931
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the weirdest and one of the ones </v>

1781
01:23:15.931 --> 01:23:17.270
<v Speaker 1>where you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think probably affect the,</v>

1782
01:23:17.450 --> 01:23:17.910
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1783
01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:21.430
<v Speaker 1>like the curve of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the curve of society is going to</v>

1784
01:23:21.431 --> 01:23:26.431
<v Speaker 1>get affected more by fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts then buy virtually anything </v>

1785
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:29.740
<v Speaker 1>that they've ever had as far as like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1786
01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:33.760
<v Speaker 1>like exposed electronic media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's television,</v>

1787
01:23:33.761 --> 01:23:38.761
<v Speaker 1>whether it's radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all those things had a big </v>

1788
01:23:38.761 --> 01:23:40.801
<v Speaker 1>impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think podcasting and viewer </v>

1789
01:23:40.801 --> 01:23:43.030
<v Speaker 1>created or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a regular user created content,</v>

1790
01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:45.840
<v Speaker 1>whatever it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with Webcams,</v>

1791
01:23:45.850 --> 01:23:50.850
<v Speaker 1>people writing blogs like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new stream of stuff that's coming </v>

1792
01:23:50.850 --> 01:23:52.660
<v Speaker 1>down the pipe now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so different.</v>

1793
01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:55.120
<v Speaker 1>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were no podcasts like yours.</v>

1794
01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:57.670
<v Speaker 1>It did not exist when I was in high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

1795
01:23:57.790 --> 01:23:59.440
<v Speaker 1>If it did exist when I was in high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

1796
01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.810
<v Speaker 1>me and my friends would a huddled around</v>
<v Speaker 1>candles.</v>

1797
01:24:02.150 --> 01:24:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would have sat around listening and </v>

1798
01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:08.390
<v Speaker 2>we would have talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think Dunkin's right?</v>

1799
01:24:08.391 --> 01:24:09.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad's a fucking asshole,</v>

1800
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:16.270
<v Speaker 2>he just wants me to suffer like and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll fucking regret it on his dying </v>

1801

<v Speaker 2>death bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but will I let him regretted?</v>

1802
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Fuck No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking my guitar and I'm fucking </v>

01:24:22.930 --> 01:24:26.171
<v Speaker 2>hitchhiked into Canada and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think you know that that exists </v>

1804
01:24:27.291 --> 01:24:29.890
<v Speaker 2>now in mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not</v>

1805
01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:31.450
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're doing it.</v>

1806
01:24:31.451 --> 01:24:36.451
<v Speaker 1>There's so many of our friends have </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast bill burn and Brian Cowen and </v>

1807
01:24:36.451 --> 01:24:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Ari Shaffir and Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a fucking epidemic.</v>

1808
01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:41.900
<v Speaker 1>And you want to talk about an epidemic </v>
<v Speaker 1>of entertainment.</v>

1809
01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:45.020
<v Speaker 1>It's podcasting is an epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1810
01:24:45.021 --> 01:24:47.230
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1811
01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:52.410
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what it's going to evolve into </v>

1812
01:24:52.410 --> 01:24:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's still in the early </v>

1813
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:56.800
<v Speaker 1>embryonic phases of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what it's going to be in 15 </v>

1814
01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:01.121
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it will be or how it will be </v>

1815
01:25:01.121 --> 01:25:01.121
<v Speaker 1>accepted or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what it will be.</v>

1816
01:25:01.121 --> 01:25:02.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's going to vary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like everything else varies.</v>

1817
01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:03.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1818
01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:04.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's books that are dog shit.</v>

1819
01:25:04.491 --> 01:25:07.160
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get a goddamn thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of him and his books that you read,</v>

1820
01:25:07.161 --> 01:25:12.161
<v Speaker 1>like the war of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just read a couple of passages and </v>

1821
01:25:12.161 --> 01:25:12.161
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

01:25:12.161 --> 01:25:13.310
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking guys nailing it,</v>

1823
01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:13.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1824
01:25:13.770 --> 01:25:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

1825
01:25:14.691 --> 01:25:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Like this is a real game changer.</v>

1826
01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:21.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy has given me the tools to </v>

1827
01:25:21.900 --> 01:25:22.220
<v Speaker 1>reapproach my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my way of looking at the very thing I do</v>

1828
01:25:22.221 --> 01:25:23.210
<v Speaker 1>for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1829
01:25:23.211 --> 01:25:24.530
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of nuts.</v>

1830
01:25:24.980 --> 01:25:25.650
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

1831
01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:29.150
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of variation when it comes</v>

1832
01:25:29.151 --> 01:25:34.151
<v Speaker 1>to podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the possibility that someone </v>

1833
01:25:34.151 --> 01:25:35.150
<v Speaker 1>could just express something and it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get there immediately.</v>

1834
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Think of it all the time and effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to put two,</v>

1835
01:25:37.371 --> 01:25:42.371
<v Speaker 1>creating a book like sex at dawn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and think about if you just decided to </v>

1836
01:25:42.371 --> 01:25:47.111
<v Speaker 1>break that discussion up into x amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of podcasts and just freely relay your </v>

1837
01:25:48.861 --> 01:25:51.830
<v Speaker 1>experiences on the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the information where you got it from.</v>

1838
01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Passionately talk about these cultures </v>
<v Speaker 1>where these people have these unique </v>

1839
01:25:57.130 --> 01:25:58.340
<v Speaker 1>experiences with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Passionately.</v>

1840
01:25:58.341 --> 01:26:03.341
<v Speaker 1>Talk about the roots of common </v>
<v Speaker 1>misconceptions about things like </v>

1841
01:26:03.341 --> 01:26:05.570
<v Speaker 1>promiscuity and a lot this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all missing in a flat word.</v>

1842
01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:06.710
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could get that,</v>

1843
01:26:06.711 --> 01:26:09.980
<v Speaker 1>you gather the pros and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of paint the.</v>

1844
01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:12.190
<v Speaker 1>But to hear a person say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1845
01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:14.960
<v Speaker 1>to hear you talk about your work is </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost more rewarding.</v>

1846
01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:16.570
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's.</v>

1847
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:20.430
<v Speaker 6>And it's very rewarding on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on my side is a writer because the thing</v>

1848
01:26:20.431 --> 01:26:25.431
<v Speaker 6>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not one of these people who always </v>

1849
01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:26.991
<v Speaker 6>wanted to be a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always had people telling me I should </v>

1850
01:26:26.991 --> 01:26:27.570
<v Speaker 6>be a writer because when I wrote </v>
<v Speaker 6>something it worked,</v>

1851
01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.730
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I never liked.</v>

1852
01:26:29.731 --> 01:26:34.731
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I still don't like writing and people </v>

1853
01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:34.731
<v Speaker 6>get really disappointed to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1854
01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:34.731
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1855
01:26:34.731 --> 01:26:38.720
<v Speaker 6>what's your process and my process.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just avoided it as long as possible </v>

1856
01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:38.720
<v Speaker 6>and then do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1857
01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:40.230
<v Speaker 6>that's my process.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hate it.</v>

1858
01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:45.620
<v Speaker 6>I really like public speaking and I like</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff like this because there's an </v>

1859
01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:45.620
<v Speaker 6>immediacy to it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1860
01:26:45.620 --> 01:26:50.520
<v Speaker 6>it's the difference between sitting in a</v>
<v Speaker 6>studio and making a record and doing </v>

1861
01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:50.570
<v Speaker 6>concerts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

1862
01:26:50.571 --> 01:26:55.571
<v Speaker 6>it's energy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're not terrified by public </v>

1863
01:26:55.571 --> 01:26:56.540
<v Speaker 6>speaking is none of us are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You guys know better than me.</v>

1864
01:26:56.541 --> 01:27:01.541
<v Speaker 6>It it fills you with energy to be on </v>
<v Speaker 6>stage and see people responding to what </v>

1865
01:27:01.541 --> 01:27:03.330
<v Speaker 6>you're saying as opposed to draining it </v>
<v Speaker 6>out of you.</v>

1866
01:27:03.331 --> 01:27:04.200
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Also,</v>

1867
01:27:04.201 --> 01:27:06.150
<v Speaker 6>I think that I can clearly see that</v>

1868
01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:08.800
<v Speaker 1>benefited greatly from all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations.</v>

1869
01:27:08.801 --> 01:27:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I know me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's expanded my thought.</v>

1870
01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:16.900
<v Speaker 6>It's an education 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It gives people a reason to take time </v>

1871
01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:19.300
<v Speaker 6>out of their day and talk with you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is so cool.</v>

1872
01:27:19.330 --> 01:27:19.930
<v Speaker 6>It's also</v>

1873
01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:25.240
<v Speaker 1>made me very enthusiastic about </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating with people and I think </v>

1874
01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.360
<v Speaker 1>the art of conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1875
01:27:26.361 --> 01:27:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I think we're so lost in the day to day </v>
<v Speaker 1>grind where people have to pretend to be</v>

1876
01:27:31.101 --> 01:27:33.050
<v Speaker 1>something they're not for the majority </v>
<v Speaker 1>of their day.</v>

1877
01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:36.560
<v Speaker 1>They have to be reserved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't make jokes,</v>

1878
01:27:36.561 --> 01:27:41.561
<v Speaker 1>you can't talk about anything that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really crazy or current commercial </v>

1879
01:27:41.561 --> 01:27:41.780
<v Speaker 1>because you have to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're there to work.</v>

1880
01:27:41.781 --> 01:27:46.130
<v Speaker 1>You're not there to be yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's all this suppression and then</v>

1881
01:27:46.131 --> 01:27:51.131
<v Speaker 1>when people get free of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you know how much time do they </v>

1882
01:27:51.131 --> 01:27:53.561
<v Speaker 1>really have to truly open up and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>more people you are around that are </v>

1883
01:27:54.351 --> 01:27:59.351
<v Speaker 1>exposing you to different thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I love about </v>

1884
01:27:59.351 --> 01:28:00.650
<v Speaker 1>talking to you as you and I often agree </v>
<v Speaker 1>on things,</v>

1885
01:28:00.651 --> 01:28:04.550
<v Speaker 1>but we also have wildly different </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives that we come at things from</v>

1886
01:28:04.670 --> 01:28:05.130
<v Speaker 1>and your.</v>

1887
01:28:05.190 --> 01:28:06.960
<v Speaker 1>You'll oftentimes come at something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1888
01:28:06.961 --> 01:28:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1889
01:28:07.890 --> 01:28:12.890
<v Speaker 1>I didn't fucking know I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're coming at it from such a </v>

1890
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:14.480
<v Speaker 1>weird place that I probably never would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have considered,</v>

1891
01:28:14.630 --> 01:28:19.630
<v Speaker 1>but because you're my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to consider that and then I get </v>

1892
01:28:19.630 --> 01:28:21.410
<v Speaker 1>enriched by this possibility and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you being my friend,</v>

1893
01:28:21.411 --> 01:28:26.411
<v Speaker 1>you will come up with another </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility and we all feed off of each </v>

1894
01:28:26.411 --> 01:28:30.071
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then other people listened to that </v>

1895
01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:30.071
<v Speaker 1>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1896
01:28:30.071 --> 01:28:33.161
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to Duncan trussell talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this thing and Christopher Ryan </v>

1897
01:28:33.161 --> 01:28:33.350
<v Speaker 1>said that this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then and then boom,</v>

1898
01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:36.320
<v Speaker 1>and that branches out and then it </v>
<v Speaker 1>spreads from there.</v>

1899
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:40.010
<v Speaker 1>The enhancement that you feel in having </v>
<v Speaker 1>these conversations is contagious.</v>

1900
01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:42.170
<v Speaker 1>It's contagious to other people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to it.</v>

1901
01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:44.250
<v Speaker 6>I met people in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in Maputo,</v>

1902
01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:47.350
<v Speaker 6>Mozambique who listened to Dunkin's </v>
<v Speaker 6>podcast.</v>

1903
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:53.190
<v Speaker 6>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 6>completely randomly,</v>

1904
01:28:53.191 --> 01:28:58.191
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sitting at a table in this wedding </v>

1905
01:28:58.191 --> 01:28:59.880
<v Speaker 6>and I said something about a podcast and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then someone at the table is like,</v>

1906
01:29:00.090 --> 01:29:02.140
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I listen to like,</v>

1907
01:29:02.190 --> 01:29:03.810
<v Speaker 6>who do you listen to it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

1908
01:29:03.811 --> 01:29:04.620
<v Speaker 6>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

1909
01:29:04.621 --> 01:29:06.840
<v Speaker 6>this Guy Duncan trussell,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he's in La.</v>

1910
01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.490
<v Speaker 6>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I heard of him.</v>

1911
01:29:08.491 --> 01:29:09.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1912
01:29:09.421 --> 01:29:14.421
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking bad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I got an email from someone saying a </v>

1913
01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:19.520
<v Speaker 6>fedex driver in Utah who listens to my </v>
<v Speaker 6>podcast when he's driving and I'm sure </v>

1914
01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.120
<v Speaker 6>yours as well since we're all sort of in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the same.</v>

1915
01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:26.540
<v Speaker 6>And a woman in Finland who listens to it</v>
<v Speaker 6>when she's commuting to work in the </v>

1916
01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:30.831
<v Speaker 6>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she got up and she wants to know she's </v>

1917
01:29:30.831 --> 01:29:31.980
<v Speaker 6>got to be hot and it's dark up there all</v>
<v Speaker 6>winter.</v>

1918
01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.200
<v Speaker 6>She wants a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She wants,</v>

1919
01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:38.870
<v Speaker 6>she wants to make sure we don't get.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's got to go to the bathroom again.</v>

1920
01:29:41.870 --> 01:29:46.870
<v Speaker 6>The if you just stop and think about the</v>
<v Speaker 6>amount of downloads and the amount of </v>

1921
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.870
<v Speaker 6>episodes,</v>

1922
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:48.510
<v Speaker 1>just throw it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what this podcast is?</v>

1923
01:29:48.511 --> 01:29:49.580
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we like?</v>

1924
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Four 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>400,</v>

1925
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:53.760
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>433rd podcast.</v>

1926
01:29:53.790 --> 01:29:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Each one of them is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority of them are at least two </v>

1927
01:29:58.790 --> 01:29:59.340
<v Speaker 1>hours long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are three.</v>

1928
01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:03.870
<v Speaker 1>The majority of my three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only a few that are like an hour</v>

1929
01:30:03.871 --> 01:30:08.871
<v Speaker 1>or more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just slightly more so that's a lot of </v>

1930
01:30:08.871 --> 01:30:11.451
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of fucking information </v>

1931
01:30:11.451 --> 01:30:11.451
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1932
01:30:11.451 --> 01:30:11.451
<v Speaker 6>Can I just say what we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 6>this.</v>

1933
01:30:11.451 --> 01:30:16.290
<v Speaker 6>It sounds like an ass kiss thing here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you have really kind listeners.</v>

1934
01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:21.780
<v Speaker 6>Every time I'm on your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get so many tweets and emails from </v>

1935
01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:24.940
<v Speaker 6>people and nobody's being a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure there are addicts out there,</v>

1936
01:30:24.941 --> 01:30:27.010
<v Speaker 6>but for some reason they don't bother </v>
<v Speaker 6>writing.</v>

1937
01:30:27.290 --> 01:30:28.250
<v Speaker 6>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Dicks.</v>

1938
01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:30.100
<v Speaker 6>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1939
01:30:30.150 --> 01:30:34.780
<v Speaker 6>I mean people are just so enthusiastic </v>
<v Speaker 6>and supportive and cool.</v>

1940
01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:38.050
<v Speaker 6>It's a really interesting self selected </v>
<v Speaker 6>community,</v>

1941
01:30:38.051 --> 01:30:41.630
<v Speaker 6>I guess because people who are dicks </v>
<v Speaker 6>probably wouldn't be attracted to this</v>

1942
01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:42.870
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1943
01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:48.140
<v Speaker 1>I think people resonate with like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imitator atmosphere to a great extent </v>

1944
01:30:49.620 --> 01:30:54.620
<v Speaker 1>and if you grow up in a terrible place </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a place that has weird tribal </v>

1945
01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:57.981
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we've seen it time and time </v>

1946
01:30:57.981 --> 01:30:57.981
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to Africa and like the tradition</v>

1947
01:30:57.981 --> 01:31:00.810
<v Speaker 1>of putting plates in your lips to </v>
<v Speaker 1>signify how many cows you get.</v>

1948
01:31:01.260 --> 01:31:05.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not a weird fucking things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do and you can get in a bad group</v>

1949
01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:11.030
<v Speaker 1>and you can get into bad pattern and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get into a bad groove that a lot of </v>

1950
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:14.040
<v Speaker 1>other people are also in and it's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to do and you see that in.</v>

1951
01:31:14.500 --> 01:31:19.500
<v Speaker 1>There's radio stations that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>followings where it's known that if you </v>

1952
01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:19.500
<v Speaker 1>go on stage with the opiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ego.</v>

1953
01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I love Opie and Anthony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was</v>

1954
01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:23.390
<v Speaker 6>no in amongst a lot of comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you get up there,</v>

1955
01:31:23.391 --> 01:31:24.590
<v Speaker 6>we're going to fucking torture you.</v>

1956
01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Like bill burr has a famous video of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my favorite radio show ever open</v>

1957
01:31:30.301 --> 01:31:31.800
<v Speaker 1>anthony show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not criticizing them.</v>

1958
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:37.070
<v Speaker 1>But there are a bunch of men talk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit and they're what they call the </v>

1959
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.590
<v Speaker 1>pests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the listeners,</v>

1960
01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:42.780
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking savages sap badges and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they booed dom irrera and after they </v>

1961
01:31:44.251 --> 01:31:47.670
<v Speaker 1>blew down the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Burr is a huge [inaudible] fan,</v>

1962
01:31:47.671 --> 01:31:52.671
<v Speaker 1>always has been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Bill went on after him and just tore </v>

1963
01:31:52.671 --> 01:31:53.940
<v Speaker 1>the whole city a new asshole just kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking shit about Philadelphia,</v>

1964
01:31:53.941 --> 01:31:58.941
<v Speaker 1>but they created that somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their intentions with their </v>

1965
01:31:58.941 --> 01:32:00.790
<v Speaker 1>broadcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they put out in their broadcast.</v>

1966
01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:05.290
<v Speaker 1>And I did not plan on this in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>

1967
01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:08.110
<v Speaker 1>This is just something that's happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of it.</v>

1968
01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:10.870
<v Speaker 1>The amount of positivity that's come out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

1969
01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:16.050
<v Speaker 1>the attitude of the people that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of embracing health and,</v>

1970
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:21.470
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and good thinking and being kind to </v>

1971
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:21.470
<v Speaker 1>people being of paramount importance.</v>

1972
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:22.600
<v Speaker 1>One of the most important things in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

1973
01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:25.660
<v Speaker 1>not get your shit together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not you be the fucking man,</v>

1974
01:32:25.661 --> 01:32:27.040
<v Speaker 1>not you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Successful.</v>

1975
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:29.920
<v Speaker 1>No number one most important thing is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be nice.</v>

1976
01:32:30.130 --> 01:32:33.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be kind until you can't be kind.</v>

1977
01:32:33.150 --> 01:32:34.600
<v Speaker 1>So you got to tell people to shut the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck up.</v>

1978
01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're killing me.</v>

1979
01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:39.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's be kind until you hit that point 90</v>

1980
01:32:39.490 --> 01:32:40.830
<v Speaker 1>yourself to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1981
01:32:40.960 --> 01:32:43.300
<v Speaker 1>and also be willing to do that same shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>to yourself.</v>

1982
01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:48.590
<v Speaker 1>You're willing to be like super </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective to super self analytical and </v>

1983
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:50.290
<v Speaker 1>be just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just try to get through this and realize</v>

1984
01:32:50.291 --> 01:32:52.150
<v Speaker 1>that if five people can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5 million can do it.</v>

1985
01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.910
<v Speaker 1>It's that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I always say like this room,</v>

1986
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:56.150
<v Speaker 1>here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

1987
01:32:56.200 --> 01:32:58.120
<v Speaker 1>I beaten it to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a good one.</v>

1988
01:32:58.540 --> 01:33:00.310
<v Speaker 1>If we were the only people on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

1989
01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:05.080
<v Speaker 1>if it was just us and we existed on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird island and everywhere else,</v>

1990
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:06.130
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look guys,</v>

1991
01:33:06.131 --> 01:33:08.290
<v Speaker 1>we got a lot of food here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're fine.</v>

1992
01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:11.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a vibrant ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has No predators.</v>

1993
01:33:11.530 --> 01:33:13.390
<v Speaker 1>We can live here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be okay.</v>

1994
01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:15.320
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you were fucking Duncan.</v>

1995
01:33:15.321 --> 01:33:17.990
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we found this weird sex shit.</v>

1996
01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:23.820
<v Speaker 5>Get that out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's got the beard is like,</v>

1997
01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:27.670
<v Speaker 5>where are the girls?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have to find girls.</v>

1998
01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:30.370
<v Speaker 5>I know as soon as he said like us guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>on an island,</v>

1999
01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:30.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm thinking</v>

2000
01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:39.100
<v Speaker 1>us friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were in any place where we were </v>

2001
01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:41.701
<v Speaker 1>forced to be together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would ultimately figure out a way to </v>

2002
01:33:41.701 --> 01:33:41.701
<v Speaker 1>work it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would suck if there weren't girls.</v>

2003
01:33:41.701 --> 01:33:45.040
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately there would be no wars.</v>

2004
01:33:45.041 --> 01:33:47.040
<v Speaker 1>What my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there will be,</v>

2005
01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:48.550
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't be a war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2006
01:33:48.551 --> 01:33:51.740
<v Speaker 1>you and I have net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've even the minor disagreements,</v>

2007
01:33:51.741 --> 01:33:55.090
<v Speaker 1>so we have ever had ever in our 10 plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>year friendship,</v>

2008
01:33:55.240 --> 01:34:00.240
<v Speaker 1>they've been cured off with a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentences back and forth instantly and </v>

2009
01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:03.040
<v Speaker 1>always super cool and always on like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2010

<v Speaker 1>hurt your feelings.</v>

2011
01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:08.200
<v Speaker 1>That's not what a friend does ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2012
01:34:08.201 --> 01:34:10.150
<v Speaker 1>if we lived on an island together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be the same thing.</v>

2013
01:34:10.830 --> 01:34:12.370
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden it'd be like,</v>

2030
01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:52.820
<v Speaker 6>nasty hobbs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ian,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dominating society.</v>

<v Speaker 6>if they break the kids glasses and it's </v>

2033
01:34:58.671 --> 01:34:58.671
<v Speaker 6>all and shaky</v>

2034
01:34:58.671 --> 01:34:59.300
<v Speaker 2>piggy,</v>

2036
01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:02.060
<v Speaker 2>Fuck him,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Those deliverance to burt reynolds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck them in deliverance.</v>

2038
01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:12.140
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A blind kid.</v>

2039
01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even worse,</v>

2040
01:35:14.690 --> 01:35:19.690
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these kids actually did get stranded on </v>

2041
01:35:19.690 --> 01:35:22.151
<v Speaker 2>an island somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the the basis of the </v>

2042
01:35:22.151 --> 01:35:24.701
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a historical event and they </v>

2043
01:35:24.701 --> 01:35:28.210
<v Speaker 2>cooperated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took care of each other and survived </v>

2044
01:35:28.210 --> 01:35:28.210
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2045
01:35:28.210 --> 01:35:31.040
<v Speaker 2>and there wasn't any of that nastiness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole hobbsy and idea.</v>

2046
01:35:31.041 --> 01:35:34.310
<v Speaker 2>We were talking earlier about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominant paradigm in the bullshit that,</v>

2047
01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:39.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>network tv was putting out for so long </v>

2048
01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:42.131
<v Speaker 2>that it's now getting subverted by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet and buy all these different </v>

2049
01:35:42.131 --> 01:35:43.700
<v Speaker 2>channels of information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

2050
01:35:43.701 --> 01:35:48.701
<v Speaker 2>one of the most pernicious ones is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of human nature being nasty in its </v>

2051
01:35:48.701 --> 01:35:50.410
<v Speaker 2>essence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Hobbs Ian view of.</v>

2052
01:35:50.411 --> 01:35:52.040
<v Speaker 2>I take it you're not a fan of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>walking dead.</v>

2053
01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:54.650
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just find it boring.</v>

2054
01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:57.410
<v Speaker 2>I watched the first season or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it was like,</v>

2055
01:35:57.411 --> 01:35:58.130
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2056
01:35:58.131 --> 01:36:03.131
<v Speaker 2>The heads of blow up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The classic scenario of people wind up </v>

2057
01:36:03.131 --> 01:36:07.601
<v Speaker 2>being their worst enemies around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Zombie seem pretty easy to deal with </v>

2058
01:36:07.601 --> 01:36:08.360
<v Speaker 2>after awhile because people that become </v>
<v Speaker 2>the real issue,</v>

2059
01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:09.920
<v Speaker 2>including,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2060
01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:12.390
<v Speaker 2>the men who want to choose the Alpha is </v>
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>

2061
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:13.770
<v Speaker 2>We'll see the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2062
01:36:13.771 --> 01:36:16.570
<v Speaker 2>the notion that we even have an Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2063
01:36:16.630 --> 01:36:19.850
<v Speaker 2>is more complicated than it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2064
01:36:19.851 --> 01:36:22.730
<v Speaker 2>we're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humans never organized themselves into a</v>

2065
01:36:22.731 --> 01:36:24.750
<v Speaker 2>wolf packs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not the way we live.</v>

2066
01:36:24.990 --> 01:36:29.990
<v Speaker 2>Know never did live that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fatty while he never seen me and my </v>

2067
01:36:31.101 --> 01:36:32.030
<v Speaker 2>boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we go out,</v>

2068
01:36:32.031 --> 01:36:34.160
<v Speaker 2>Chris Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wolf Pack,</v>

2069
01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:39.600
<v Speaker 2>we all went to move in together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We slap our chest three times all in </v>

2070
01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.060
<v Speaker 2>synchronous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

2071
01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll pack jackets as well.</v>

2072
01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Past my scattered gene.</v>

2073
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:48.130
<v Speaker 2>Letters over leather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2074
01:36:49.230 --> 01:36:50.870
<v Speaker 2>that's what they call us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call it the woolpack.</v>

2075
01:36:50.871 --> 01:36:54.860
<v Speaker 2>And could you basically deal basically </v>
<v Speaker 2>like lone wolves gathered together,</v>

2076
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:59.000
<v Speaker 2>gathered together a group of lone </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves,</v>

2077
01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:05.220
<v Speaker 2>gang up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2078
01:37:05.221 --> 01:37:05.750
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2079
01:37:05.780 --> 01:37:10.100
<v Speaker 2>We have to ultimately realized that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's we 100 percent need each other.</v>

2080
01:37:10.190 --> 01:37:14.300
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most important things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also 100 per cent need the people.</v>

2081
01:37:14.301 --> 01:37:19.301
<v Speaker 2>If you want to truly be happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need the people around you to like </v>

2082
01:37:19.301 --> 01:37:19.760
<v Speaker 2>you and you need to have them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to have a reason to like you,</v>

2083
01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:23.450
<v Speaker 2>like you have to be giving out as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>as you're taking away or more.</v>

2084
01:37:23.710 --> 01:37:28.710
<v Speaker 2>And if that doesn't see this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that what you just said is that the </v>

2085
01:37:28.710 --> 01:37:31.841
<v Speaker 2>basis of what I think is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest misunderstandings in human </v>

2086
01:37:31.841 --> 01:37:32.180
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2087
01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:37.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they use game theory to try to work out </v>

2088
01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:40.061
<v Speaker 2>how our ancestors lived in one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>assumptions is the freeloader </v>

2089
01:37:40.061 --> 01:37:42.230
<v Speaker 2>assumption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is that you can't possibly,</v>

2090
01:37:42.231 --> 01:37:47.231
<v Speaker 2>our ancestors couldn't possibly have </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived in a sharing kind of environment </v>

2091
01:37:47.231 --> 01:37:49.220
<v Speaker 2>economically because some people would </v>
<v Speaker 2>just take and take and take and not give</v>

2092
01:37:49.221 --> 01:37:50.360
<v Speaker 2>anything back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2093
01:37:50.630 --> 01:37:55.630
<v Speaker 2>And so that's a base assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then from that they justify </v>

2094
01:37:55.630 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 2>capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doggy dog</v>

2095
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.030
<v Speaker 4>economics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2096
01:37:57.031 --> 01:37:57.510
<v Speaker 4>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2097
01:37:57.511 --> 01:38:02.511
<v Speaker 4>it must have been that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the fact is shame is a hugely </v>

2098
01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:07.580
<v Speaker 4>motivating force and as you just said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are designed by nature to really care</v>

2099
01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:11.850
<v Speaker 4>whether the people around us love us or </v>
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>

2100
01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:13.980
<v Speaker 4>And if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it freaks us out.</v>

2101
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:18.000
<v Speaker 4>So people work always to give back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the group,</v>

2102
01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:19.920
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if you're not giving back to the</v>

2103
01:38:19.921 --> 01:38:21.990
<v Speaker 4>group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you worst case scenario,</v>

2104
01:38:21.991 --> 01:38:24.060
<v Speaker 4>you get banished by the group,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're dead,</v>

2105
01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:26.450
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is why they stayed at the party.</v>

2106
01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:31.500
<v Speaker 4>Your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that experiences rejection is in a </v>

2107
01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:31.500
<v Speaker 4>different part of the brain hurts worse </v>
<v Speaker 4>than anything.</v>

2108
01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:31.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2109
01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:37.400
<v Speaker 1>it does too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why kids are so cruel with </v>

2110
01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:37.400
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they reject each other,</v>

2111
01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:38.460
<v Speaker 1>when they're at play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not playing with you anymore.</v>

2112
01:38:39.170 --> 01:38:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're exercising that little muscle.</v>

2113
01:38:41.731 --> 01:38:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

2114
01:38:43.051 --> 01:38:43.980
<v Speaker 1>I can get someone to dance.</v>

2115
01:38:44.890 --> 01:38:45.980
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man Shit.</v>

2116
01:38:45.981 --> 01:38:50.981
<v Speaker 4>To them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is like the thing at this retreat </v>

2117
01:38:50.981 --> 01:38:50.981
<v Speaker 4>that they talked about that I really </v>
<v Speaker 4>love,</v>

2118
01:38:50.981 --> 01:38:50.981
<v Speaker 4>man is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

2119
01:38:50.981 --> 01:38:52.460
<v Speaker 4>So you're saying be kind to other </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

2120
01:38:52.630 --> 01:38:57.630
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the question is how can you be </v>

2121
01:38:57.630 --> 01:38:57.630
<v Speaker 4>authentically kind to the people around </v>
<v Speaker 4>you?</v>

2122
01:38:57.630 --> 01:39:01.450
<v Speaker 4>And the simple simple answer is you have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to love yourself first.</v>

2123
01:39:02.091 --> 01:39:05.990
<v Speaker 4>You can't reject yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't be the rejecting force because</v>

2124
01:39:05.991 --> 01:39:10.991
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times your personality is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>personality constructed by people who </v>

2125
01:39:10.991 --> 01:39:12.980
<v Speaker 4>rejected you from the moment you started</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking your parents.</v>

2126
01:39:12.981 --> 01:39:15.620
<v Speaker 4>It's not even you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're rejecting yourself.</v>

2127
01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:18.710
<v Speaker 4>The first thing is start loving </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

2128
01:39:18.740 --> 01:39:23.740
<v Speaker 4>Embrace yourself right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to make a big change and </v>

2129
01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:25.370
<v Speaker 4>that cause like if you want to really </v>
<v Speaker 4>change somebody's,</v>

2130
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:30.790
<v Speaker 4>love them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>love a person will get around unless </v>

2131
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.790
<v Speaker 4>they're super annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just avoid them.</v>

2132
01:39:31.420 --> 01:39:32.730
<v Speaker 4>Love everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't fix it.</v>

2133
01:39:33.090 --> 01:39:33.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2134
01:39:34.150 --> 01:39:35.310
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's you know,</v>

2135
01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:37.550
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Certain people are of course,</v>

2136
01:39:37.700 --> 01:39:41.390
<v Speaker 4>but in general,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to watch somebody change,</v>

2137
01:39:41.930 --> 01:39:46.930
<v Speaker 4>get around them and just like them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just beam love at them and watch how </v>

2138
01:39:46.930 --> 01:39:47.990
<v Speaker 4>they act.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because here's one thing that is certain</v>

2139
01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:52.610
<v Speaker 4>being mean to people does not make </v>
<v Speaker 4>people better because if it did,</v>

2140
01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:55.390
<v Speaker 4>we would live on a planet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other cool motherfuckers.</v>

2141
01:39:55.980 --> 01:40:00.980
<v Speaker 4>This planet would be filled with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sweetest people ever because we're also </v>

2142
01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:01.390
<v Speaker 4>cruel to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work.</v>

2143
01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:04.330
<v Speaker 4>That's very simplistic and here's why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why</v>

2144
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:08.330
<v Speaker 1>it is because it's not that everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>also mean to each other.</v>

2145
01:40:08.331 --> 01:40:09.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just that when we are mean to each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

2146
01:40:09.861 --> 01:40:14.861
<v Speaker 1>it hurts so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you stop and think about your </v>

2147
01:40:14.861 --> 01:40:14.861
<v Speaker 1>interactions with people on a daily </v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

2148
01:40:14.861 --> 01:40:19.450
<v Speaker 1>There's very few main ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the mall today and I wandered </v>

2149
01:40:19.450 --> 01:40:20.780
<v Speaker 1>through a couple of stores and I met a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people that said,</v>

2150
01:40:20.781 --> 01:40:22.520
<v Speaker 1>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met a bunch of people that were at the</v>

2151
01:40:22.521 --> 01:40:24.710
<v Speaker 1>fucking coffee beans stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

2152
01:40:24.711 --> 01:40:27.020
<v Speaker 1>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met a guy in the parking lot.</v>

2153
01:40:27.021 --> 01:40:27.800
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi.</v>

2154
01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:30.110
<v Speaker 1>There was very little negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>

2155
01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:31.080
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2156
01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:33.020
<v Speaker 1>but when?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it happens,</v>

2157
01:40:33.230 --> 01:40:38.230
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the real problem is when we </v>

2158
01:40:38.230 --> 01:40:41.441
<v Speaker 1>look at life today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is a huge issue with our view of </v>

2159
01:40:41.441 --> 01:40:45.200
<v Speaker 1>the world is based on seven fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion people and that's madness.</v>

2160
01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:47.470
<v Speaker 1>You can have the information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fears,</v>

2161
01:40:47.650 --> 01:40:52.650
<v Speaker 1>the tragedies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the events of 7 billion people inside </v>

2162
01:40:52.650 --> 01:40:53.800
<v Speaker 1>your fucking head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't that.</v>

2163
01:40:53.801 --> 01:40:58.801
<v Speaker 1>It's too God damn big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just think about the </v>

2164
01:40:58.801 --> 01:40:58.801
<v Speaker 1>infinite amount of living beings in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe itself?</v>

2165
01:40:58.801 --> 01:41:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Why not consider all the fucking mold </v>
<v Speaker 1>spores that are probably going to die </v>

2166
01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:04.960
<v Speaker 1>when someone sprayed lysol on them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go fucking hogwild and worry about</v>

2167
01:41:04.961 --> 01:41:06.190
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

2168
01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:11.340
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to get through your 24 hour </v>

2169
01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:11.560
<v Speaker 1>time period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know only of which you're awake.</v>

2170
01:41:11.561 --> 01:41:14.800
<v Speaker 1>16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to fucking prioritize.</v>

2171
01:41:14.830 --> 01:41:19.830
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't fucking prioritize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to have time to enjoy </v>

2172
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:23.551
<v Speaker 1>this experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not gonna have time to take it </v>

2173
01:41:23.551 --> 01:41:23.551
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be caught up in the wave of,</v>

2174
01:41:23.551 --> 01:41:25.630
<v Speaker 1>of momentum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of other people's ideas and you'll never</v>

2175
01:41:25.631 --> 01:41:26.560
<v Speaker 1>be able to catch yourself.</v>

2176
01:41:26.660 --> 01:41:31.220
<v Speaker 6>But rejecting someone takes energy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if I understand what you're saying,</v>

2177
01:41:31.310 --> 01:41:36.310
<v Speaker 6>called Verizon and change the number </v>
<v Speaker 6>that takes energy to,</v>

2178
01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:39.290
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how long have you been on </v>
<v Speaker 6>hold with verizon,</v>

2179
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:40.790
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2180
01:41:40.791 --> 01:41:42.380
<v Speaker 6>what you were describing is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2181
01:41:42.381 --> 01:41:44.810
<v Speaker 6>it's a psychotherapeutic thing where </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

2182
01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:47.860
<v Speaker 6>no matter who's sitting across the table</v>
<v Speaker 6>from you,</v>

2183
01:41:47.861 --> 01:41:50.540
<v Speaker 6>you have to accept them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're not accepting them,</v>

2184
01:41:50.541 --> 01:41:52.280
<v Speaker 6>you're never going to be able to help </v>
<v Speaker 6>them.</v>

2185
01:41:53.010 --> 01:41:58.010
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't mean you have to like them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>doesn't mean you have to not be annoyed </v>

2186
01:41:58.010 --> 01:41:58.190
<v Speaker 6>by them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it means you'll respect them.</v>

2187
01:41:58.191 --> 01:42:03.191
<v Speaker 6>You respect like whatever it is that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>annoying about them is something that's </v>

2188
01:42:03.291 --> 01:42:07.220
<v Speaker 6>resonating in you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Carl Jung said like every person who</v>

2189
01:42:07.221 --> 01:42:12.221
<v Speaker 6>irritates you is an opportunity to learn</v>
<v Speaker 6>something about yourself because you </v>

2190
01:42:12.221 --> 01:42:15.920
<v Speaker 6>know that person is annoying to you in a</v>
<v Speaker 6>special sort of way.</v>

2191
01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:21.130
<v Speaker 6>Often Times you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and so there's something about you </v>

2192
01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:21.130
<v Speaker 6>that's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>terrified of seeing that those words,</v>

2193
01:42:21.130 --> 01:42:26.020
<v Speaker 4>the implication of what you're saying is</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you embrace those qualities in </v>

2194
01:42:26.020 --> 01:42:28.820
<v Speaker 4>yourself that you can't even accept,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're casting them into the world,</v>

2195
01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:34.060
<v Speaker 4>then all of a sudden those people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>are so annoying to you stop being as </v>

2196
01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:37.451
<v Speaker 4>annoying because you're not seeing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of yourself you hate reflected on </v>

2197
01:42:37.451 --> 01:42:37.451
<v Speaker 4>the screen of them</v>

2198
01:42:37.451 --> 01:42:42.190
<v Speaker 6>possibly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and also possibly they feel accepted so </v>

2199
01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:42.560
<v Speaker 6>they don't need to keep doing that </v>
<v Speaker 6>bullshit to you.</v>

2200
01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:47.640
<v Speaker 4>It's an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do an experiment and here's the </v>

2201
01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:47.710
<v Speaker 4>great experiment because probably for </v>
<v Speaker 4>your entire life,</v>

2202
01:42:47.711 --> 01:42:51.520
<v Speaker 4>when you get around Douche bags,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you either aggressively attack them,</v>

2203
01:42:51.521 --> 01:42:56.521
<v Speaker 4>passive aggressively,</v>
<v Speaker 4>attack them or try to get out of their </v>

2204
01:42:56.521 --> 01:42:56.521
<v Speaker 4>presence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so do a little experiment.</v>

2205
01:42:56.521 --> 01:42:58.120
<v Speaker 4>The next time you get around a real </v>
<v Speaker 4>douche,</v>

2206
01:42:58.210 --> 01:43:03.210
<v Speaker 4>somebody who's like really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>annoying and the Douche temperature is </v>

2207
01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:06.070
<v Speaker 4>starting to turn up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to stay there forever,</v>

2208
01:43:06.370 --> 01:43:11.370
<v Speaker 4>but look at them and look at their face </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you'll see lines in their face and </v>

2209
01:43:12.101 --> 01:43:17.101
<v Speaker 4>if you look at those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll realize this douche bag has </v>

2210
01:43:17.101 --> 01:43:20.430
<v Speaker 4>suffered just like you have suffered </v>
<v Speaker 4>this douche bag,</v>

2211
01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:21.370
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>

2212
01:43:21.490 --> 01:43:26.490
<v Speaker 4>his suffered so much that they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>created a massive defense mechanism </v>

2213
01:43:26.490 --> 01:43:30.570
<v Speaker 4>called their personality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which makes everyone think they're a </v>

2214
01:43:30.570 --> 01:43:31.900
<v Speaker 4>douche bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The world they wander through is a world</v>

2215
01:43:31.901 --> 01:43:35.980
<v Speaker 4>of faces looking at them with either </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a anxiety,</v>

2216
01:43:35.981 --> 01:43:40.981
<v Speaker 4>sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sense of claustrophobia and not </v>

2217
01:43:40.981 --> 01:43:40.981
<v Speaker 4>wanting to be in their presence anymore.</v>

2218
01:43:40.981 --> 01:43:45.360
<v Speaker 4>They're 40 or 50.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not working that the reaction the </v>

2219
01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.901
<v Speaker 4>world is giving them isn't only making </v>
<v Speaker 4>them more and more and more of a Douche </v>

2220
01:43:49.901 --> 01:43:49.901
<v Speaker 4>bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is compassion.</v>

2221
01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:55.020
<v Speaker 4>You recognize that this has suffered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to stay in this way </v>

2222
01:43:55.020 --> 01:43:55.070
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tried it the other night at a bar with</v>

2223
01:43:55.071 --> 01:43:58.930
<v Speaker 4>somebody passive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hipster Buddhism,</v>

2224
01:43:59.010 --> 01:44:00.770
<v Speaker 4>ducking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It lasted,</v>

2225
01:44:00.771 --> 01:44:02.660
<v Speaker 4>it lasted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was able to do it for like,</v>

2226
01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.970
<v Speaker 4>because this is like a guy I would never</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever,</v>

2227
01:44:04.971 --> 01:44:06.890
<v Speaker 4>ever be around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody brought him.</v>

2228
01:44:06.891 --> 01:44:11.891
<v Speaker 4>He's like this like just lucky weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>dude and he's like being just a pure </v>

2229
01:44:11.891 --> 01:44:13.000
<v Speaker 4>defense mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dick.</v>

2230
01:44:13.010 --> 01:44:15.260
<v Speaker 4>I've just gotten back from this </v>
<v Speaker 4>meditation retreat.</v>

2231
01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:16.140
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alright,</v>

2232
01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:16.730
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>

2233
01:44:16.731 --> 01:44:21.731
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to find something in this </v>

2234
01:44:21.731 --> 01:44:23.591
<v Speaker 4>person that I can love that I can </v>
<v Speaker 4>connect to that I know that this person </v>

2235
01:44:23.591 --> 01:44:23.591
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

2236
01:44:23.591 --> 01:44:25.790
<v Speaker 4>is gotten this way because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows what.</v>

2237
01:44:26.090 --> 01:44:29.870
<v Speaker 4>So I open myself up much more than I </v>
<v Speaker 4>usually do in those situations.</v>

2238
01:44:29.871 --> 01:44:34.871
<v Speaker 4>I didn't go take a leak or I didn't just</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to some other part of the bar and </v>

2239
01:44:34.871 --> 01:44:34.871
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what he starts doing man,</v>

2240
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:38.180
<v Speaker 4>he starts to like after this like whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like weird dickie,</v>

2241
01:44:38.181 --> 01:44:43.181
<v Speaker 4>like Alpha male thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden he starts pulling out </v>

2242
01:44:43.181 --> 01:44:44.480
<v Speaker 4>his phone and he's showing me pictures </v>
<v Speaker 4>of his,</v>

2243
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:45.920
<v Speaker 4>of his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of his kids,</v>

2244
01:44:46.130 --> 01:44:47.810
<v Speaker 4>and it's like not an annoying thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2245
01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:52.940
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's faces now lighting up and he loves </v>

2246
01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:55.151
<v Speaker 4>his kids and he's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of a sudden there's just this one </v>

2247
01:44:55.151 --> 01:44:57.740
<v Speaker 4>moment where the Douche has fallen away </v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's a sweet person who loves his</v>

2248
01:44:57.741 --> 01:44:59.570
<v Speaker 4>kids do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should read Christmas movies.</v>

2249
01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:01.430
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2250
01:45:02.490 --> 01:45:03.360
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2251
01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:04.240
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2252
01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:05.600
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an observer.</v>

2253
01:45:05.601 --> 01:45:10.601
<v Speaker 4>If you know the observer effect and </v>
<v Speaker 4>quantum physics where they say the </v>

2254
01:45:10.601 --> 01:45:10.601
<v Speaker 4>observation effects the thing itself.</v>

2255
01:45:10.730 --> 01:45:12.290
<v Speaker 4>In that same way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you're,</v>

2256
01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:14.810
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you just start experimenting a little</v>

2257
01:45:14.811 --> 01:45:17.450
<v Speaker 4>bit with shining compassion out into the</v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

2258
01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:22.720
<v Speaker 4>then you might get things bouncing back </v>
<v Speaker 4>that aren't these douche bags that </v>

2259
01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:26.531
<v Speaker 4>you're so used to encountering and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't have to trick yourself into </v>

2260
01:45:26.531 --> 01:45:29.351
<v Speaker 4>thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be fucking Gandhi or Rom </v>

2261
01:45:29.351 --> 01:45:29.351
<v Speaker 4>dosser.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

2262
01:45:29.351 --> 01:45:32.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm always going to be in this state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just try to maintain the state for a </v>

2263
01:45:32.710 --> 01:45:32.750
<v Speaker 4>minute thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go back to being a Dick,</v>

2264
01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:38.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maintain the state for two minutes and </v>

2265
01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.211
<v Speaker 4>if you can't do it then start punishing </v>
<v Speaker 4>the person or being weird or like </v>

2266
01:45:40.211 --> 01:45:41.450
<v Speaker 4>talking shit to him or talking shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>about him,</v>

2267
01:45:41.660 --> 01:45:44.540
<v Speaker 4>but just for try two minutes and see </v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens.</v>

2268
01:45:44.690 --> 01:45:46.910
<v Speaker 4>The effects are going to really amaze </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2269
01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:52.180
<v Speaker 4>especially if your entire life you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>only been dealing with people in a </v>

2270
01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:52.250
<v Speaker 4>shitty way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had to revise my whole.</v>

2271
01:45:52.251 --> 01:45:53.990
<v Speaker 4>Cut The vampire out of your life thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2272
01:45:53.991 --> 01:45:55.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure if that's the right way to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do it.</v>

2273
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:57.710
<v Speaker 4>I think it's love the vampire in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart.</v>

2274
01:45:57.890 --> 01:45:58.730
<v Speaker 4>I've got to revise.</v>

2275
01:45:59.020 --> 01:46:02.020
<v Speaker 6>Album is there's not enough time and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>know the real problem.</v>

2276
01:46:02.021 --> 01:46:07.021
<v Speaker 6>The number one real problem is how the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck did they get that way in the first </v>

2277
01:46:07.021 --> 01:46:09.700
<v Speaker 6>place and that's people are being raised</v>
<v Speaker 6>by shitheads,</v>

2278
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:15.000
<v Speaker 6>so they're imprinting,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're copying the behavior of </v>

2279
01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:15.430
<v Speaker 6>failures.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like Duncan said it.</v>

2280
01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:18.640
<v Speaker 6>There's a deep rejection at the heart of</v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody like that.</v>

2281
01:46:18.650 --> 01:46:20.590
<v Speaker 6>I'm reminded of some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some people,</v>

2282
01:46:20.770 --> 01:46:25.540
<v Speaker 6>some women I know who were sexually </v>
<v Speaker 6>abused and then immediately put on a lot</v>

2283
01:46:25.541 --> 01:46:27.410
<v Speaker 6>of weight right after,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

2284
01:46:27.550 --> 01:46:28.900
<v Speaker 6>Protection,</v>
<v Speaker 6>risk protection,</v>

2285
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:32.620
<v Speaker 6>and it's also remove me from that whole </v>
<v Speaker 6>dynamic with men.</v>

2286
01:46:32.621 --> 01:46:34.600
<v Speaker 6>I got hurt in that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remove me from it.</v>

2287
01:46:34.601 --> 01:46:36.190
<v Speaker 6>Make me unattractive to them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2288
01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:41.460
<v Speaker 6>So the guy who was being a dick,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's being a dick in a way because he </v>

2289
01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:45.151
<v Speaker 6>can't stand to be rejected by you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he has to be never accepted yet.</v>

2290
01:46:46.691 --> 01:46:46.930
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2291
01:46:46.930 --> 01:46:49.830
<v Speaker 6>And just like negate the whole whole </v>
<v Speaker 6>issue.</v>

2292
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:51.930
<v Speaker 6>It's no fun man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you start,</v>

2293
01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:53.650
<v Speaker 6>when you compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you're,</v>

2294
01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:58.660
<v Speaker 6>if you get a kick out of like rejecting </v>
<v Speaker 6>people or if you get a kick out of like </v>

2295
01:46:58.660 --> 01:47:01.990
<v Speaker 6>creating a us and them paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it really is a uh,</v>

2296
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:04.710
<v Speaker 6>it's a problem because suddenly when you</v>
<v Speaker 6>like realize like,</v>

2297
01:47:04.711 --> 01:47:05.400
<v Speaker 6>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2298
01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:07.830
<v Speaker 6>this guy's just like me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2299
01:47:07.831 --> 01:47:09.780
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I had been in his situation,</v>

2300
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:12.120
<v Speaker 6>I might even been more of a dick then he</v>
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

2301
01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:13.740
<v Speaker 6>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just don't know.</v>

2302
01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:16.590
<v Speaker 6>And it's cooked into our society.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is the thing.</v>

2303
01:47:16.591 --> 01:47:21.591
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you guys both probably agree </v>

2304
01:47:21.591 --> 01:47:24.141
<v Speaker 6>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that we live in a deeply </v>

2305
01:47:24.141 --> 01:47:26.631
<v Speaker 6>pathological society and a healthy </v>
<v Speaker 6>person in the society is by definition </v>

2306
01:47:26.631 --> 01:47:27.790
<v Speaker 6>going to seem really strange,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2307
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:30.870
<v Speaker 6>because they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're not in sync with the society.</v>

2308
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:33.270
<v Speaker 6>Have you heard of the continuum concept </v>
<v Speaker 6>now?</v>

2309
01:47:33.510 --> 01:47:34.150
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2310
01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:39.220
<v Speaker 6>it's a book written by a woman who found</v>
<v Speaker 6>herself pretty randomly living with more</v>

2311
01:47:39.901 --> 01:47:44.901
<v Speaker 6>or less stone-age tribe in Venezuela and</v>
<v Speaker 6>she observed the way they raise children</v>

2312
01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:47.940
<v Speaker 6>and she wrote this book and her and her </v>
<v Speaker 6>thesis.</v>

2313
01:47:47.941 --> 01:47:49.800
<v Speaker 6>This was in the late sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 6>early seventies.</v>

2314
01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:53.460
<v Speaker 6>The thesis is essentially when a baby's </v>
<v Speaker 6>born in this society,</v>

2315
01:47:53.850 --> 01:47:58.850
<v Speaker 6>that baby is in physical contact with </v>
<v Speaker 6>his mother or another adult basically </v>

2316
01:47:58.850 --> 01:48:03.021
<v Speaker 6>constantly until he or she doesn't want </v>
<v Speaker 6>to be anymore and is off running around </v>

2317
01:48:03.021 --> 01:48:03.240
<v Speaker 6>with their friends,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2318
01:48:03.570 --> 01:48:05.610
<v Speaker 6>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whereas in our society,</v>

2319
01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:10.700
<v Speaker 6>up until the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 6>doctors were telling parents not to </v>

2320
01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:13.050
<v Speaker 6>touch their infants,</v>
<v Speaker 6>put the infant in the crib.</v>

2321
01:48:13.170 --> 01:48:15.450
<v Speaker 6>No matter how much it costs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do not touch it.</v>

2322
01:48:15.900 --> 01:48:18.990
<v Speaker 6>By caressing your child,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you create pathology.</v>

2323
01:48:18.991 --> 01:48:22.230
<v Speaker 6>You create sickness and illness and </v>
<v Speaker 6>weakness.</v>

2324
01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:25.860
<v Speaker 6>This was until the 1950 right.</v>

2325
01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:31.250
<v Speaker 6>Lots of lots of kids died.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was called hospital ism because the </v>

2326
01:48:31.250 --> 01:48:34.530
<v Speaker 6>problem is you had on the one side of </v>
<v Speaker 6>this sort of macho male asshole attitude</v>

2327
01:48:34.531 --> 01:48:38.550
<v Speaker 6>dominating medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no woman doctors and the nurses opinions</v>

2328
01:48:38.551 --> 01:48:43.551
<v Speaker 6>didn't count for anything because the </v>
<v Speaker 6>men knew best and on the other hand you </v>

2329
01:48:43.551 --> 01:48:46.581
<v Speaker 6>had the germ theory is I'm talking early</v>
<v Speaker 6>20th century now where it was,</v>

2330
01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:50.190
<v Speaker 6>it was understood that contagion was a </v>
<v Speaker 6>big problem.</v>

2331
01:48:50.370 --> 01:48:54.150
<v Speaker 6>So they started putting newborn infants </v>
<v Speaker 6>in these incubators,</v>

2332
01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:59.180
<v Speaker 6>these isolation tanks and they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 6>allowing the mothers to even pick them </v>

2333
01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:01.230
<v Speaker 6>up and touch them because they had no </v>
<v Speaker 6>way of testing for germs.</v>

2334
01:49:01.231 --> 01:49:02.220
<v Speaker 6>They just knew,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2335
01:49:02.221 --> 01:49:07.221
<v Speaker 6>germs were somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So all these kids are dying and the and </v>

2336
01:49:07.221 --> 01:49:11.061
<v Speaker 6>the nurses are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well of course you got to pick them up </v>

2337
01:49:11.061 --> 01:49:11.061
<v Speaker 6>there crying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look,</v>

2338
01:49:11.061 --> 01:49:12.210
<v Speaker 6>you know the women are resonating and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the doctors are saying no,</v>

2339
01:49:12.211 --> 01:49:13.080
<v Speaker 6>you can't touch them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2340
01:49:13.081 --> 01:49:13.410
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2341
01:49:13.411 --> 01:49:14.400
<v Speaker 6>no touching,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no touching.</v>

2342
01:49:14.730 --> 01:49:19.620
<v Speaker 6>And they were like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 6>25 percent death rate in the most modern</v>

2343
01:49:19.621 --> 01:49:24.621
<v Speaker 6>American hospitals that we're so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really fucked up.</v>

2344
01:49:27.450 --> 01:49:31.230
<v Speaker 6>And someone will be so confident to </v>
<v Speaker 6>avoid the natural instincts.</v>

2345
01:49:31.430 --> 01:49:32.160
<v Speaker 6>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2346
01:49:32.161 --> 01:49:33.900
<v Speaker 6>we override them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2347
01:49:33.901 --> 01:49:35.340
<v Speaker 6>A masturbation,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it'll kill you.</v>

2348
01:49:35.341 --> 01:49:37.500
<v Speaker 6>It'll make you blind.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'll make you crazy.</v>

2349
01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:39.240
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we will make.</v>

2350
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:42.720
<v Speaker 6>If you do it wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're coughing your eyes,</v>

2351
01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:47.800
<v Speaker 6>your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then into a tree</v>

2352
01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:54.740
<v Speaker 1>which is right up there on sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tying yourself to death as far as stupid</v>

2353
01:49:54.791 --> 01:49:55.950
<v Speaker 1>as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2354
01:49:55.951 --> 01:49:58.060
<v Speaker 1>That's texting while driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go off a cliff.</v>

2355
01:49:58.140 --> 01:49:59.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy,</v>

2356
01:49:59.291 --> 01:50:04.291
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like Paris Hilton's </v>
<v Speaker 1>veterinary or a plastic surgeon or </v>

2357
01:50:04.291 --> 01:50:05.080
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some famous plastic surgeon.</v>

2358
01:50:05.081 --> 01:50:09.670
<v Speaker 1>And he tweeted a second before he fell </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the side of a fucking cliff.</v>

2359
01:50:11.340 --> 01:50:14.430
<v Speaker 6>I really thing I just retweeted a thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>a few days ago.</v>

2360
01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:19.580
<v Speaker 6>Some some computer designer or somebody </v>
<v Speaker 6>who was working in the office tweeted A.</v>

2361
01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:23.460
<v Speaker 6>I've been on the job 30 hours feeling </v>
<v Speaker 6>great.</v>

2362
01:50:23.490 --> 01:50:24.240
<v Speaker 6>And then he died.</v>

2363
01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:26.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like at his desk,</v>

2364
01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:28.700
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2365
01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:31.230
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about a woman who went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2366
01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:31.450
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2367
01:50:31.451 --> 01:50:33.860
<v Speaker 1>It's another one I think you're thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>of going on right now.</v>

2368
01:50:33.861 --> 01:50:35.630
<v Speaker 1>She went to Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a PR woman.</v>

2369
01:50:35.750 --> 01:50:36.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

2370
01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just landed in and it got picked up </v>

2371
01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:42.400
<v Speaker 1>because she didn't know that the AIDS </v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

2372
01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:45.950
<v Speaker 1>She goes well off to South Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hope I don't get aids.</v>

2373
01:50:45.980 --> 01:50:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Just kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm white.</v>

2374
01:50:47.410 --> 01:50:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it was.</v>

2375
01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Probably on Xanax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably had a glass of wine.</v>

2376
01:50:53.630 --> 01:50:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know what the fuck she was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woke up to a national controversy.</v>

2377
01:50:57.770 --> 01:50:58.880
<v Speaker 1>She had apologized.</v>

2378
01:50:58.930 --> 01:51:03.010
<v Speaker 6>Father said he was ashamed over some guy</v>
<v Speaker 6>went to the airport to meet her and took</v>

2379
01:51:03.011 --> 01:51:06.190
<v Speaker 6>some pictures and then interviewed her </v>
<v Speaker 6>father while they were waiting I guess,</v>

2380
01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:08.710
<v Speaker 6>and the father was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't believe she said that.</v>

2381
01:51:08.711 --> 01:51:11.380
<v Speaker 6>He's South African.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Speaking of weird stuff.</v>

2382
01:51:11.381 --> 01:51:13.920
<v Speaker 6>What about the Steve Martin thing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you hear about this?</v>

2383
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:19.990
<v Speaker 6>What he tweeted?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Somebody wrote like he was doing a back </v>

2384
01:51:19.990 --> 01:51:23.701
<v Speaker 6>and forth with some of his followers on </v>
<v Speaker 6>twitter and somebody wrote a l like </v>

<v Speaker 6>wrote.</v>

2387
01:51:30.071 --> 01:51:31.840
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it depends if you're going to an African</v>

2388
01:51:31.841 --> 01:51:33.850
<v Speaker 6>American restaurant or an Italian </v>
<v Speaker 6>restaurant</v>

2389
01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:39.960
<v Speaker 1>and people got really offended by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He deleted the tweet and then when Cada </v>

<v Speaker 1>screenshot apologized and illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's not nothing.</v>

2392
01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:46.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's a</v>

01:51:46.970 --> 01:51:51.970
<v Speaker 6>have about saying there's a black </v>
<v Speaker 6>American vernacular that sounds </v>

2394
01:51:51.970 --> 01:51:53.550
<v Speaker 6>different than you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like how is that insulting to anybody?</v>

2395
01:51:53.710 --> 01:51:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this conversation with someone </v>

2396
01:51:58.710 --> 01:51:58.710
<v Speaker 1>where I was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2397
01:51:58.710 --> 01:51:59.950
<v Speaker 1>how you can listen to someone talk on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the phone and know if they're black.</v>

2398
01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:01.540
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2399
01:52:01.541 --> 01:52:02.230
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2400
01:52:02.231 --> 01:52:03.190
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

2401
01:52:03.370 --> 01:52:08.370
<v Speaker 1>You do know I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that there's anything </v>

2402
01:52:08.370 --> 01:52:11.041
<v Speaker 1>wrong with being black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can tell when you're talking to </v>

2403
01:52:11.041 --> 01:52:12.460
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tell if the guy's black.</v>

2404
01:52:12.490 --> 01:52:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you then let me.</v>

2405
01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:18.940
<v Speaker 6>I would argue that there are some people</v>
<v Speaker 6>who you can hear and know they're black.</v>

2406
01:52:19.150 --> 01:52:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Very common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that you can </v>

2407
01:52:24.150 --> 01:52:26.911
<v Speaker 1>listen to anyone and another black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of black people who </v>

2408
01:52:26.911 --> 01:52:26.911
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be able to tell.</v>

2409
01:52:26.911 --> 01:52:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see a of white people that can say,</v>

2410
01:52:29.100 --> 01:52:29.600
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2411
01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:35.280
<v Speaker 1>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is that quality that does </v>

2412
01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:35.280
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course there's nothing wrong with it.</v>

2413
01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Like the idea that that was she was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was looking at it like she wouldn't </v>

2414
01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:42.721
<v Speaker 1>touch it with a 10 foot pole because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was politically incorrect and it was a </v>

2415
01:52:42.721 --> 01:52:42.721
<v Speaker 1>dangerous thing to discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2416
01:52:42.721 --> 01:52:47.280
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it dangerous to say that black </v>

2417
01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:47.360
<v Speaker 1>people oftentimes have a different way </v>
<v Speaker 1>of talking?</v>

2418
01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:48.590
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2419
01:52:48.620 --> 01:52:53.620
<v Speaker 1>No one's saying bad or worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying that people that are </v>

2420
01:52:53.620 --> 01:52:55.040
<v Speaker 1>from the west coast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll have a different way of talking.</v>

2421
01:52:55.041 --> 01:52:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Then people that live in Minnesota or </v>
<v Speaker 1>then people that live in New York,</v>

2422
01:52:57.891 --> 01:52:59.720
<v Speaker 1>of course they did dialect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they do.</v>

2423
01:52:59.721 --> 01:53:02.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or it isn't like super intelligent.</v>

2424
01:53:02.691 --> 01:53:06.080
<v Speaker 1>People like fineman had a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronounced New York accent.</v>

2425
01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he?</v>

2426
01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:08.390
<v Speaker 1>And he was Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2427
01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Pronounced Jewish New York accent and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of the most brilliant physicists</v>

2428
01:53:13.011 --> 01:53:13.570
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2429
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean it doesn't mean anything,</v>

2430
01:53:14.950 --> 01:53:18.650
<v Speaker 4>but that's the thing in America now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything around around sex,</v>

2431
01:53:18.660 --> 01:53:21.450
<v Speaker 4>you and I talked about this last time or</v>
<v Speaker 4>or race is,</v>

2432
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:24.760
<v Speaker 4>is so explosive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It here's a comedian,</v>

2433
01:53:24.761 --> 01:53:25.750
<v Speaker 4>Steve Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>

2434
01:53:25.780 --> 01:53:28.990
<v Speaker 4>He's been in the trenches forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is he retracting that?</v>

2435
01:53:28.991 --> 01:53:29.750
<v Speaker 4>Why is he apollo</v>

2436
01:53:30.930 --> 01:53:35.930
<v Speaker 1>going to die?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's my new song.</v>

2437
01:53:38.440 --> 01:53:40.480
<v Speaker 1>While he's a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's really what it is.</v>

2438
01:53:40.481 --> 01:53:41.980
<v Speaker 1>He's a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want anybody's feelings,</v>

2439
01:53:41.981 --> 01:53:43.050
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was afraid of</v>

2440
01:53:43.180 --> 01:53:44.260
<v Speaker 4>offend them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>

2441
01:53:44.261 --> 01:53:46.240
<v Speaker 4>when people are offended over you </v>
<v Speaker 4>breathing,</v>

2442
01:53:46.270 --> 01:53:46.810
<v Speaker 4>fuck them.</v>

2443
01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:48.910
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's not A.</v>

2444
01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:52.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's a confrontational guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

2445
01:53:53.010 --> 01:53:54.380
<v Speaker 1>He's an interesting cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

2446
01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Steve Martin is a fascinating dude </v>
<v Speaker 1>because first of all he was unbelievably</v>

2447
01:53:59.221 --> 01:54:03.150
<v Speaker 1>hilarious and unbelievably innovative </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he first came out.</v>

2448
01:54:03.151 --> 01:54:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a unique cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole thing was very unique.</v>

2449
01:54:06.810 --> 01:54:08.640
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His Act was very unique.</v>

2450
01:54:08.641 --> 01:54:11.280
<v Speaker 1>It was really funny and silly and slap </v>
<v Speaker 1>sticky,</v>

2451
01:54:11.281 --> 01:54:14.440
<v Speaker 1>but he's a unique guy in the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>he got huge,</v>

2452
01:54:14.441 --> 01:54:19.441
<v Speaker 1>really successful and then didn't like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that people would laugh about </v>

2453
01:54:19.441 --> 01:54:21.420
<v Speaker 1>anything that he did and he didn't feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you had this real honest connection</v>

2454
01:54:21.421 --> 01:54:23.850
<v Speaker 1>with them anymore and like pulled away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from comedy,</v>

2455
01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:26.070
<v Speaker 1>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do comedy in clumps anymore.</v>

2456
01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:28.490
<v Speaker 4>Like the Beatles stopped touring because</v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody could.</v>

2457
01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:30.290
<v Speaker 4>They're screaming so loud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't hear the music.</v>

2458
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:35.770
<v Speaker 4>I went.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to this talk with Steve Martin </v>

2459
01:54:35.770 --> 01:54:36.910
<v Speaker 4>and Steve Martin was there with an </v>
<v Speaker 4>author and [inaudible].</v>

2460
01:54:36.911 --> 01:54:38.540
<v Speaker 4>You were saying he's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>confrontational.</v>

2461
01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:43.840
<v Speaker 4>This was like six years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's there at Steve Martin's there with </v>

2462
01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:47.051
<v Speaker 4>this author.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's clearly a big fan of this author </v>

2463
01:54:47.051 --> 01:54:49.040
<v Speaker 4>and somebody in the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The audience is getting to ask questions</v>

2464
01:54:49.070 --> 01:54:54.070
<v Speaker 4>and some asshole says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a question for the guy who isn't </v>

2465
01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:56.870
<v Speaker 4>Steve Martin and Steve Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember exactly what he said to</v>

2466
01:54:56.871 --> 01:55:00.500
<v Speaker 4>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was a brutal evisceration of this</v>

2467
01:55:00.501 --> 01:55:05.501
<v Speaker 4>guy for being a disrespectful asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you saw the color just rush out of </v>

2468
01:55:05.501 --> 01:55:06.510
<v Speaker 4>the guy's face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2470
01:55:07.610 --> 01:55:12.610
<v Speaker 4>he's just being rude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just by saying the guy who's not </v>

2471
01:55:12.610 --> 01:55:12.610
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not dot Martin,</v>

2474
01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:16.610
<v Speaker 4>He did it to defend his friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2475
01:55:16.611 --> 01:55:21.611
<v Speaker 4>And it was brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you still see that guy still a </v>

2476
01:55:21.611 --> 01:55:21.611
<v Speaker 4>comic man because it was like,</v>

2489
01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:52.890

01:56:28.501 --> 01:56:31.430
<v Speaker 2>Comedian branches spread their wings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do a woody allen movie.</v>

2507
01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Louis C,</v>

2508
01:56:32.371 --> 01:56:34.290
<v Speaker 2>k just did one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clay.</v>

2509
01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Andrew dice clay was in the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an article online about Andrew </v>

2510
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Dice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clay deserving.</v>

2511
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Then Oscar for that role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really good.</v>

2512
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:44.580
<v Speaker 2>I just saw that on the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked it,</v>

2513
01:56:44.581 --> 01:56:47.440
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't see a lot of drama there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2514
01:56:47.470 --> 01:56:52.350
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't playing an autistic person or </v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought it was very authentic.</v>

2515
01:56:52.590 --> 01:56:55.430
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was a really worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2516
01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:56.850
<v Speaker 2>he's a good actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2517
01:56:56.910 --> 01:56:59.310
<v Speaker 2>and it's surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Woody Allen,</v>

2518
01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:00.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize that.</v>

2519
01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:06.320
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you seen that preview for that </v>

2520
01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:06.320
<v Speaker 2>Werewolf movie coming out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

2521
01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:06.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2522
01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

2523
01:57:08.730 --> 01:57:11.640
<v Speaker 2>It's one movie Dunkin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an American Werewolf in London.</v>

2524
01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:14.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a God damn perfect movie of </v>
<v Speaker 2>preaching to the choir.</v>

2525
01:57:14.101 --> 01:57:19.101
<v Speaker 2>Everything since then sucks the fat that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one where he takes acid and turns </v>

2526
01:57:19.101 --> 01:57:23.391
<v Speaker 2>into a werewolf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I resented that as an acid had at </v>

2527
01:57:23.391 --> 01:57:24.900
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The preview or William hurt?</v>

2528
01:57:24.930 --> 01:57:25.200
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2529
01:57:25.201 --> 01:57:26.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about American Werewolf in </v>
<v Speaker 2>London.</v>

2530
01:57:26.761 --> 01:57:28.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got chomped.</v>

2531
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:30.740
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking of alternate.</v>

2532
01:57:31.130 --> 01:57:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

2533
01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:38.840
<v Speaker 2>That premise up so bad monkey turned </v>
<v Speaker 2>into some sort of monkey from taking </v>

2534
01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:39.930
<v Speaker 2>acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2535
01:57:39.931 --> 01:57:43.350
<v Speaker 2>he got into the sensory deprivation tank</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was based on living.</v>

2536
01:57:43.351 --> 01:57:45.290
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole idea.</v>

2537
01:57:46.130 --> 01:57:47.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible.</v>

2538
01:57:47.790 --> 01:57:52.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was great at the time and </v>

2539
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:52.790
<v Speaker 2>it was important to me because it got me</v>
<v Speaker 2>into isolation tanks,</v>

2540
01:57:52.790 --> 01:57:54.570
<v Speaker 2>but it's terrible if you try to watch it</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2541
01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:57.210
<v Speaker 2>but the best part is the schizophrenia </v>
<v Speaker 2>on acid saying,</v>

2542
01:57:57.240 --> 01:57:59.760
<v Speaker 2>I feel like my heart is being touched by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ.</v>

2543
01:58:00.750 --> 01:58:02.910
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a great line in that movie.</v>

2544
01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:04.500
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking for new wedges.</v>

2545
01:58:04.501 --> 01:58:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Saw the river's edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen that?</v>

2546
01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:07.920
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quintin.</v>

2547
01:58:08.130 --> 01:58:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Crispin Glover University.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it a long time ago.</v>

2548
01:58:12.030 --> 01:58:14.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a really strange movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy's too much for.</v>

2549
01:58:14.881 --> 01:58:17.250
<v Speaker 2>Very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like Dunkin.</v>

2550
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:22.430
<v Speaker 2>If he went completely off the ipad and </v>
<v Speaker 2>became a meth head and I need to start </v>

2551
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.590
<v Speaker 2>doing math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking love.</v>

2552
01:58:22.591 --> 01:58:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can be so crazy.</v>

2553
01:58:25.111 --> 01:58:27.750
<v Speaker 2>Like in his movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's so good at what he does.</v>

2554
01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:29.040
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who else is really good?</v>

2555
01:58:29.041 --> 01:58:31.680
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the cat's name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why everyone's a cat today.</v>

2556
01:58:31.890 --> 01:58:33.330
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the guy's name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was,</v>

2557
01:58:33.331 --> 01:58:35.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the bad guys and the x files.</v>

2558
01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:39.750
<v Speaker 2>He's at one weird dude that you'd never </v>
<v Speaker 2>know his name.</v>

2559
01:58:39.751 --> 01:58:41.360
<v Speaker 2>But when he's in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a movie like,</v>

2560
01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's</v>

2561
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:43.230
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

2562
01:58:43.231 --> 01:58:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

2563
01:58:43.881 --> 01:58:46.690
<v Speaker 1>there are several people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is that old dude?</v>

2564
01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Creepy old dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what this werewolf movie </v>

2565
01:58:52.771 --> 01:58:53.110
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2566
01:58:53.111 --> 01:58:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I can't find any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2567
01:58:54.430 --> 01:58:59.430
<v Speaker 1>things online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the trailer for </v>

2568
01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.430
<v Speaker 1>transcendence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2569
01:58:59.430 --> 01:59:00.370
<v Speaker 1>the trailer for transcendence looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting.</v>

2570
01:59:00.371 --> 01:59:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the japs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2571
01:59:03.971 --> 01:59:08.971
<v Speaker 1>it's essentially the idea of the full </v>
<v Speaker 1>ray Kurzweil vision being realized with </v>

2572
01:59:09.941 --> 01:59:14.941
<v Speaker 1>one guy being Johnny Depp playing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurzweil character gets killed by </v>

2573
01:59:14.941 --> 01:59:15.700
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as he's dying,</v>

2574
01:59:15.701 --> 01:59:17.980
<v Speaker 1>they download his consciousness into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

2575
01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.050
<v Speaker 1>You got to play it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>

2576
01:59:20.970 --> 01:59:25.970
<v Speaker 7>She,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Jesus Christ requires us to one of the </v>

2577
01:59:26.131 --> 01:59:28.350
<v Speaker 7>most fundamental secrets of the </v>
<v Speaker 7>universe.</v>

2578
01:59:32.580 --> 01:59:37.580
<v Speaker 7>Imagine that machine with a full range </v>
<v Speaker 7>of human emotions intense will be </v>

2579
01:59:39.231 --> 01:59:44.231
<v Speaker 7>greater than the collective intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 7>of every person in the history of the </v>

2580
01:59:45.921 --> 01:59:50.921
<v Speaker 7>world.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Some scientists refer to this as the </v>

2581
01:59:50.921 --> 01:59:54.311
<v Speaker 7>singularity.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I call it transcendence series of </v>

2582
01:59:58.141 --> 02:00:03.141
<v Speaker 7>attacks conducted by radical anti-tech </v>
<v Speaker 7>group known as rift labs all over the </v>

2583
02:00:03.601 --> 02:00:08.601
<v Speaker 7>country.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We lost decades of research and </v>

2584
02:00:08.601 --> 02:00:08.601
<v Speaker 7>development.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's radiation poisoning.</v>

2585
02:00:08.601 --> 02:00:12.840
<v Speaker 7>The bullet must've been laced with it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The effect is the reversible will's body</v>

2586
02:00:12.841 --> 02:00:17.841
<v Speaker 7>is dying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but his mind is a pattern of electrical </v>

2587
02:00:17.841 --> 02:00:18.240
<v Speaker 7>signals.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We can upload his consciousness.</v>

2588
02:00:18.510 --> 02:00:23.220
<v Speaker 7>We can save him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Assuming that this works,</v>

2589
02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:26.850
<v Speaker 7>if we missed anything,</v>
<v Speaker 7>thought childhood memory.</v>

2590
02:00:27.290 --> 02:00:28.770
<v Speaker 7>How well do you know who you're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 7>with?</v>

2591
02:00:38.170 --> 02:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>

2592
02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

2593
02:00:42.130 --> 02:00:45.710
<v Speaker 7>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Need to get me online.</v>

2594
02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:50.880
<v Speaker 7>I need more power,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe intelligent bait and be sent to </v>

2595
02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:50.880
<v Speaker 7>you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Shove it down.</v>

2596
02:00:52.750 --> 02:00:56.120
<v Speaker 7>Your friends crossed a line out the </v>
<v Speaker 7>danger.</v>

2597
02:00:59.270 --> 02:01:04.270
<v Speaker 7>So how do we fight it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Evolve?</v>

2598
02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:12.600
<v Speaker 7>Where's the machine?</v>

2599
02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Where are you going?</v>

2600
02:01:33.450 --> 02:01:33.890
<v Speaker 7>Wow.</v>

2601
02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:40.300
<v Speaker 1>That they could fuck that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be one of those movies where </v>

2602
02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:40.300
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>story in the.</v>

2606
02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:47.850
<v Speaker 3>That's what they do now.</v>

02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're doing in there?</v>

2623
02:02:34.630 --> 02:02:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Put that thing on for two minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to vomit.</v>

2624
02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:43.080
<v Speaker 3>Nausea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all my utopian ideas about the </v>

2625
02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:45.001
<v Speaker 3>occupants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really steroid corrected that they say </v>

2626
02:02:45.001 --> 02:02:45.040
<v Speaker 3>the new ones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's this,</v>

2627
02:02:45.070 --> 02:02:47.050
<v Speaker 3>there's this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like latency.</v>

2628
02:02:47.051 --> 02:02:52.051
<v Speaker 3>If there's 15 millisecond latency or </v>
<v Speaker 3>some kind of latency between when you </v>

2629
02:02:52.051 --> 02:02:56.101
<v Speaker 3>move your head and when it registers </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you've moved your head and it's in </v>

2630
02:02:56.101 --> 02:02:59.401
<v Speaker 3>milliseconds and under a certain amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently you don't get motion </v>

2631
02:02:59.401 --> 02:03:03.091
<v Speaker 3>sickness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but where my oculus rift is that right </v>

2632
02:03:03.091 --> 02:03:06.391
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I have a drunk friend over and </v>

2633
02:03:06.391 --> 02:03:06.391
<v Speaker 3>they put on that rift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just turned green.</v>

2634
02:03:06.420 --> 02:03:08.800
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

2635
02:03:08.830 --> 02:03:11.890
<v Speaker 3>So police could use it as a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As an alcohol test.</v>

2636
02:03:12.070 --> 02:03:14.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You x could use it if you.</v>

2637
02:03:14.171 --> 02:03:15.990
<v Speaker 3>If you're sick of using your finger to </v>
<v Speaker 3>vomit,</v>

2638
02:03:16.050 --> 02:03:20.110
<v Speaker 3>just put on the oculus rift and run </v>
<v Speaker 3>around half life for six minutes.</v>

2639
02:03:20.111 --> 02:03:21.820
<v Speaker 3>You spew dementia</v>

2640
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:26.030
<v Speaker 1>in films is reproducing American </v>
<v Speaker 1>Werewolf in London.</v>

2641
02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:28.460
<v Speaker 1>They're going to reboot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has the same story.</v>

2642
02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:29.510
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2643
02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:31.580
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To leave it alone.</v>

2644
02:03:31.820 --> 02:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just hope they don't go CGI and fuck </v>

2645
02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will.</v>

2646
02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>When?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When?</v>

2647
02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:38.870
<v Speaker 1>When did we make that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's some,</v>

2648
02:03:38.871 --> 02:03:43.871
<v Speaker 1>but it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That worked with amazing of the body </v>

2649
02:03:43.871 --> 02:03:46.601
<v Speaker 1>snatchers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when they remade Texas </v>

2650
02:03:46.601 --> 02:03:46.601
<v Speaker 1>chainsaw massacre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want me to call the police.</v>

2651
02:03:49.190 --> 02:03:52.310
<v Speaker 1>I watched the second invasion of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>body snatchers last night.</v>

2652
02:03:52.311 --> 02:03:55.310
<v Speaker 1>That Donald Sutherland one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the second one I believe.</v>

2653
02:03:55.330 --> 02:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>

2654
02:03:56.360 --> 02:03:57.980
<v Speaker 1>There's one from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

2655
02:03:58.010 --> 02:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Am I correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A black and white was an old black and </v>

2656
02:04:03.010 --> 02:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>white one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

2657
02:04:03.010 --> 02:04:06.581
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's true because I watched it </v>

2658
02:04:06.581 --> 02:04:06.581
<v Speaker 1>actually and it was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that I remember.</v>

2659
02:04:06.581 --> 02:04:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I've seen three of them.</v>

2660
02:04:07.010 --> 02:04:09.080
<v Speaker 1>There's a Jennifer Tilly won two are meg</v>
<v Speaker 1>tilly,</v>

2661
02:04:09.530 --> 02:04:11.450
<v Speaker 1>tilly one later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the uh,</v>

2662
02:04:11.451 --> 02:04:16.451
<v Speaker 1>the original one is really fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's like a lot like the </v>

2663
02:04:16.451 --> 02:04:19.850
<v Speaker 1>twilight zone movie in that it's a time </v>
<v Speaker 1>capsule you would not work today.</v>

2664
02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:24.880
<v Speaker 1>It would be a terrible piece of shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you wouldn't believe that they </v>

2665
02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:27.521
<v Speaker 1>could actually make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you watch it in the context of </v>

2666
02:04:27.521 --> 02:04:28.100
<v Speaker 1>it being from like 1951 or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it was,</v>

2667
02:04:28.370 --> 02:04:29.870
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2668
02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:30.320
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

2669
02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:31.610
<v Speaker 3>And ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2670
02:04:31.611 --> 02:04:35.300
<v Speaker 3>even if the effects are bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ideas are timeless,</v>

2671
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:38.280
<v Speaker 3>like old star trek episodes or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or twilight</v>

2672
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:40.170
<v Speaker 4>zone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of those ideas were just amazing.</v>

2673
02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they ran out of them though.</v>

2674
02:04:42.091 --> 02:04:44.400
<v Speaker 1>They used them all up on those fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2675
02:04:44.401 --> 02:04:46.910
<v Speaker 1>all those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hitchcock shows and all those,</v>

2676
02:04:46.930 --> 02:04:48.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

2677
02:04:49.100 --> 02:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>What are those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that one show that they had </v>

2678
02:04:54.100 --> 02:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>

2679
02:04:54.100 --> 02:04:54.610
<v Speaker 4>fuck night gallery?</v>

2680
02:04:56.380 --> 02:04:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2681
02:04:56.861 --> 02:04:58.010
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

2682
02:04:58.011 --> 02:05:00.430
<v Speaker 1>the twilight zone and then there was one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was like,</v>

2683
02:05:00.431 --> 02:05:02.450

<v Speaker 1>it</v>

2685
02:05:04.030 --> 02:05:06.550
<v Speaker 4>love American style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The love boat.</v>

2686
02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:12.000
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a similar thing to the </v>

2687
02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:12.000
<v Speaker 4>twilight zone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I can't remember what it is now.</v>

2688
02:05:12.070 --> 02:05:15.520
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was called night gallery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Might have tales from the crypt.</v>

2689
02:05:15.521 --> 02:05:16.120
<v Speaker 4>The outer limits.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The outer limits was another one.</v>

2693
02:05:20.650 --> 02:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>It was very similar along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2694
02:05:22.490 --> 02:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>those guys burned through so many ideas.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Like these glitter vampires,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sun doesn't even hurt him.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It just makes him like makes their.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Very rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a completely different thing.</v>

2711
02:06:08.350 --> 02:06:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was there with like rats that were </v>

2712
02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:13.350
<v Speaker 1>people that would hypnotize people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suck their blood out.</v>

2713
02:06:13.580 --> 02:06:18.580
<v Speaker 4>Ever since you told me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you pointed out the fact that in </v>

2714
02:06:18.580 --> 02:06:19.960
<v Speaker 4>twilight this vampire is hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>years old dating a high school.</v>

2715
02:06:20.020 --> 02:06:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

2716
02:06:22.180 --> 02:06:27.180
<v Speaker 1>The idea is ridiculous that he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all have to keep going to high </v>

2717
02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:27.940
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that he died when he was 17.</v>

2718
02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:30.580
<v Speaker 1>He so cute because he died when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>17.</v>

2719
02:06:30.581 --> 02:06:34.600
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be 17 for perpetuity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's preposterous.</v>

2720
02:06:34.630 --> 02:06:36.400
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why?</v>

2721
02:06:36.450 --> 02:06:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Why doesn't he just go to fucking high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school for the 100th year in a row?</v>

2722
02:06:40.450 --> 02:06:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Just keeps giving high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody notices the fact that this guy </v>

2723
02:06:45.450 --> 02:06:46.720
<v Speaker 1>just fucking hopping around the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to high school after high school,</v>

2724
02:06:46.721 --> 02:06:48.150
<v Speaker 1>showing in as the weird loner</v>

2725
02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:50.030
<v Speaker 4>that white skin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that does happen,</v>

2726
02:06:50.031 --> 02:06:50.570
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's that.</v>

2727
02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:53.450
<v Speaker 4>You heard the story about the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 4>would pose as a fourth grader.</v>

2728
02:06:53.451 --> 02:06:54.890
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

2729
02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:59.920
<v Speaker 4>he's like some kind of like a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>person or he's got some kind of aging </v>

2730
02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:00.620
<v Speaker 4>thing and you would enroll himself in </v>
<v Speaker 4>elementary schools.</v>

2731
02:07:00.621 --> 02:07:03.890
<v Speaker 4>Like there was this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was an adult who was in an elementary</v>

2732
02:07:03.891 --> 02:07:06.820
<v Speaker 4>school for like a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like mine.</v>

2733
02:07:06.850 --> 02:07:08.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember his name though,</v>

2734
02:07:08.661 --> 02:07:12.170
<v Speaker 4>but it was like he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would just pretend to be a kid,</v>

2735
02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:14.270
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so as an adult,</v>

2736
02:07:14.271 --> 02:07:14.700
<v Speaker 4>it's funny.</v>

2737
02:07:14.950 --> 02:07:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well when I was in New York there was a </v>

2738
02:07:19.950 --> 02:07:20.370
<v Speaker 1>girl who was on the Arsenio Hall show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2739
02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:25.390
<v Speaker 1>She was a stand up comic and we all knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>her as this young teenage girl from the </v>

2740
02:07:25.541 --> 02:07:29.740
<v Speaker 1>East village and she was like 14 or 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years old and she was going up and doing</v>

2741
02:07:29.780 --> 02:07:32.170
<v Speaker 1>standup and she was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2742
02:07:32.290 --> 02:07:35.080
<v Speaker 1>She was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an adult and it was weird.</v>

2743
02:07:35.260 --> 02:07:39.610
<v Speaker 1>It was weird watching because as far as </v>
<v Speaker 1>standup comics go,</v>

2744
02:07:39.670 --> 02:07:44.670
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like going to see Dunkin or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz or he wasn't like high level </v>

2745
02:07:44.670 --> 02:07:47.440
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was impressive for a 15 year old.</v>

2746
02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:52.640
<v Speaker 1>So she goes on the Arsenio Hall show and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking had phones light up and </v>

2747
02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:54.250
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to high school with this bitch.</v>

2748
02:07:54.251 --> 02:07:56.990
<v Speaker 1>She's fucking 30 like she's not in </v>
<v Speaker 1>heights.</v>

2749
02:07:57.290 --> 02:08:02.290
<v Speaker 1>She's not 14 the fuck out of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She graduated in 1986 and people start </v>

2750
02:08:02.531 --> 02:08:07.531
<v Speaker 1>going crazy and calling in and she gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she gets exposed.</v>

2751
02:08:09.460 --> 02:08:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Barry Katz client,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

2752
02:08:10.630 --> 02:08:13.080
<v Speaker 1>when she knew she'd get exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2753
02:08:13.150 --> 02:08:14.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she did.</v>

2754
02:08:14.891 --> 02:08:17.030
<v Speaker 1>I think she thought she'd get away with </v>
<v Speaker 1>it on TV.</v>

2755
02:08:17.090 --> 02:08:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if she changed her name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what she did,</v>

2756
02:08:19.720 --> 02:08:20.720
<v Speaker 1>but she went up there.</v>

2757
02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:22.840
<v Speaker 4>Don't worry though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2758
02:08:22.841 --> 02:08:24.020
<v Speaker 4>what a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2759
02:08:24.130 --> 02:08:26.890
<v Speaker 4>like 30 [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had a 15 year old kid.</v>

2760
02:08:27.030 --> 02:08:27.820
<v Speaker 4>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit like,</v>

2761
02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:30.880
<v Speaker 4>that's going to start happening more and</v>
<v Speaker 4>more with the age regression therapies.</v>

2762
02:08:30.881 --> 02:08:32.950
<v Speaker 4>They're going to have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's going to be like this.</v>

2763
02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:38.100
<v Speaker 4>Did you hear about that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing that keeps popping up about </v>

2764
02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:38.100
<v Speaker 4>the mice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you hear about this?</v>

2765
02:08:38.100 --> 02:08:39.010
<v Speaker 4>And they're going to start human trials </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a year.</v>

2766
02:08:39.460 --> 02:08:42.130
<v Speaker 4>It's some kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They figured out some way to reverse.</v>

2767
02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:44.650
<v Speaker 4>Apparently reverse the aging process in </v>
<v Speaker 4>mice.</v>

2768
02:08:44.890 --> 02:08:46.780
<v Speaker 4>They want to start human trials in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

2769
02:08:46.930 --> 02:08:49.030
<v Speaker 4>I love being around and scientists </v>
<v Speaker 4>because his both.</v>

2770
02:08:49.210 --> 02:08:53.460
<v Speaker 4>I know your bullshit fake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

2771
02:08:53.530 --> 02:08:54.340
<v Speaker 4>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2772
02:08:54.341 --> 02:08:55.780
<v Speaker 4>who knows really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2773
02:08:55.781 --> 02:08:58.240
<v Speaker 4>Where did you read this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>On the Internet?</v>

2774
02:08:58.660 --> 02:08:59.800
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's real.</v>

2775
02:08:59.801 --> 02:09:01.470
<v Speaker 4>I do think it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's an actual.</v>

2776
02:09:01.471 --> 02:09:02.870
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

2777
02:09:02.871 --> 02:09:04.570
<v Speaker 4>but every time I hear this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2778
02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:07.670
<v Speaker 4>ray Kurtzweil is going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really sorry.</v>

2779
02:09:07.671 --> 02:09:10.090
<v Speaker 4>And not because some guy shoots him with</v>
<v Speaker 4>a radioactive bullets,</v>

2780
02:09:10.210 --> 02:09:12.970
<v Speaker 1>researchers reverse aging process in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mice.</v>

2781
02:09:12.971 --> 02:09:15.850
<v Speaker 1>People could be next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is in the Huffington Post.</v>

2782
02:09:15.851 --> 02:09:17.890
<v Speaker 1>This is in a bunch of science science </v>
<v Speaker 1>journals.</v>

2783
02:09:18.190 --> 02:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>It's all over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the Mitochondria and it's </v>

2784
02:09:23.190 --> 02:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2785
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:25.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've figured out a way.</v>

2786
02:09:26.030 --> 02:09:31.030
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the age process we discovered is like a </v>

2787
02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:31.360
<v Speaker 1>married couple when they're young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they communicate well,</v>

2788
02:09:31.361 --> 02:09:33.850
<v Speaker 1>but over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in close quarters for many years,</v>

2789
02:09:33.851 --> 02:09:37.090
<v Speaker 1>communication breaks down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard University based investigator,</v>

2790
02:09:37.091 --> 02:09:39.640
<v Speaker 1>this is all like legit shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As with marriage,</v>

2791
02:09:39.641 --> 02:09:44.641
<v Speaker 1>the restoring of the lines of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication can nurse backs cells to </v>

2792
02:09:44.641 --> 02:09:45.580
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The communication breakdown is caused by</v>

2793
02:09:45.581 --> 02:09:48.490
<v Speaker 1>lower levels of the chemical called n a </v>
<v Speaker 1>d,</v>

2794
02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:51.010
<v Speaker 1>which decreases with age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prior to this study,</v>

2795
02:09:51.011 --> 02:09:56.011
<v Speaker 1>the only known ways of slowing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>decreased were to have a low calorie </v>

2796
02:09:56.011 --> 02:09:58.150
<v Speaker 1>diet and regular exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this study,</v>

2797
02:09:58.151 --> 02:10:03.151
<v Speaker 1>researchers used to compound that mimics</v>
<v Speaker 1>the benefits of diet and exercise on </v>

2798
02:10:03.151 --> 02:10:03.151
<v Speaker 1>mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

2799
02:10:03.151 --> 02:10:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Fell off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me a pill.</v>

2800
02:10:03.771 --> 02:10:06.010
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In two year old mice,</v>

2801
02:10:06.011 --> 02:10:09.970
<v Speaker 1>the compound helped reduce insulin </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance and inflammation,</v>

2802
02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:13.780
<v Speaker 1>making them nearly as healthy as mice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were just six months old.</v>

2803
02:10:14.110 --> 02:10:17.170
<v Speaker 1>It's something like a 60 year old being </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to a 20 year old</v>

2804
02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:22.980
<v Speaker 4>20 year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're about to be fucked because all </v>

2805
02:10:22.980 --> 02:10:23.890
<v Speaker 4>these 50 year olds are going to turn </v>
<v Speaker 4>into 20 year olds.</v>

2806
02:10:23.891 --> 02:10:26.350
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a mattress on a floor.</v>

2807
02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:31.120
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're sleeping on a mattress,</v>

2808
02:10:31.950 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 4>you're a d,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're now competing with people</v>

2809
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:36.110
<v Speaker 6>who should be dead and her health</v>

2810
02:10:36.770 --> 02:10:39.070
<v Speaker 1>and why does it have to be competition </v>
<v Speaker 1>and can we all just get along?</v>

2811
02:10:39.071 --> 02:10:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Can't we all just work together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

2812
02:10:40.311 --> 02:10:42.760
<v Speaker 1>This be the ultimate social utopia when </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no age,</v>

2813
02:10:42.890 --> 02:10:45.020
<v Speaker 6>you got to be ageism anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It'd be yourself.</v>

2814
02:10:45.021 --> 02:10:46.250
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because think about it.</v>

2815
02:10:46.251 --> 02:10:50.540
<v Speaker 6>The 50 year old women are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 6>like 20 year olds deck.</v>

2816
02:10:50.630 --> 02:10:53.540
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be in the game and they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>gonna have,</v>

2817
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:58.930
<v Speaker 6>they're gonna have all the experience of</v>
<v Speaker 6>having had kids and having live Loris </v>

2818
02:10:59.590 --> 02:11:00.960
<v Speaker 6>and they're not going to man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2819
02:11:01.130 --> 02:11:04.240
<v Speaker 6>Well no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but money and I find women,</v>

2820
02:11:04.650 --> 02:11:09.650
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>45 and over are a lot easier to deal </v>

2821
02:11:09.650 --> 02:11:13.271
<v Speaker 6>with a lot easier.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think they're just more </v>

2822
02:11:13.271 --> 02:11:13.271
<v Speaker 6>realistic?</v>
<v Speaker 6>More relaxed?</v>

2823
02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:16.340
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're not like living in that hallmark</v>

2824
02:11:16.341 --> 02:11:20.090
<v Speaker 6>bullshit world anymore of expected </v>
<v Speaker 6>standards that you're trying to say.</v>

2825
02:11:20.091 --> 02:11:22.660
<v Speaker 6>Chris Ryan there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they've got experience.</v>

2826
02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:25.140
<v Speaker 6>They lower their standards,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their,</v>

2827
02:11:25.160 --> 02:11:26.600
<v Speaker 6>they don't expect a lot from you.</v>

2828
02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:28.250
<v Speaker 1>They're not looking for six pack </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2829
02:11:28.670 --> 02:11:29.230
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2830
02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:30.710
<v Speaker 1>we just sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we just watch TV?</v>

2831
02:11:32.970 --> 02:11:35.160
<v Speaker 6>We just have a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'd have to walk.</v>

2832
02:11:38.100 --> 02:11:39.720
<v Speaker 6>I look forward to the future,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2833
02:11:39.721 --> 02:11:44.070
<v Speaker 6>I that I comments saw exciting to see </v>
<v Speaker 6>that kind of research star start popping</v>

2834
02:11:44.071 --> 02:11:46.000
<v Speaker 6>up because if that's popping up that you</v>
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

2835
02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:49.720
<v Speaker 1>six more things based on it that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to pop up and,</v>

2836
02:11:49.740 --> 02:11:51.560
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really cool thing.</v>

2837
02:11:51.650 --> 02:11:53.510
<v Speaker 1>They did say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

2838
02:11:53.511 --> 02:11:56.390
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said that the cost of the treatment</v>

2839
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:58.460
<v Speaker 1>course is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be insane,</v>

2840
02:11:58.510 --> 02:12:02.510
<v Speaker 1>like hundreds of thousands of dollars as</v>
<v Speaker 1>was when you bought a cell phone,</v>

2841
02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:05.720
<v Speaker 1>the first cell phone for thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars and now you can go to Bolivia.</v>

2842
02:12:05.721 --> 02:12:07.280
<v Speaker 1>In the middle of the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have cell phones.</v>

2843
02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:12.580
<v Speaker 1>There's also this artificial muscle that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've created that has 1000 times </v>

2844
02:12:12.951 --> 02:12:17.951
<v Speaker 1>human strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is another story that came out </v>

2845
02:12:17.951 --> 02:12:17.951
<v Speaker 1>today or yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather.</v>

2846
02:12:17.951 --> 02:12:22.451
<v Speaker 1>American scientists have developed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>robotic muscle 1000 times more powerful </v>

2847
02:12:22.451 --> 02:12:26.351
<v Speaker 1>than humans using a revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It using a revolutionary material that </v>

2848
02:12:26.351 --> 02:12:29.750
<v Speaker 1>fluidly cer changes its properties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>

2849
02:12:29.810 --> 02:12:34.810
<v Speaker 1>That means the invention gives vanadium </v>
<v Speaker 1>dioxide amazing superhero style powers.</v>

2850
02:12:36.610 --> 02:12:38.960
<v Speaker 1>It's most striking properties to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape,</v>

2851
02:12:39.410 --> 02:12:42.350
<v Speaker 1>shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and structure whenever differing amounts</v>

2852
02:12:42.351 --> 02:12:46.760
<v Speaker 1>of heat or applied to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are in for some really freaky shit in</v>

2853
02:12:46.761 --> 02:12:49.460
<v Speaker 1>the next couple of decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are going to get really,</v>

2854
02:12:49.461 --> 02:12:52.510
<v Speaker 1>really weird because no one saw this </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming years.</v>

2855
02:12:52.820 --> 02:12:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Things always getting really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always have been the weirdest times ever</v>

2856
02:12:57.410 --> 02:12:58.400
<v Speaker 1>are always right now.</v>

2857
02:12:59.890 --> 02:13:01.450
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I feel like a curmudgeon,</v>

2858
02:13:01.451 --> 02:13:04.000
<v Speaker 6>but.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you guys talking about reversing the</v>

2859
02:13:04.001 --> 02:13:06.430
<v Speaker 6>aging process and the super muscle and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2860
02:13:06.431 --> 02:13:09.220
<v Speaker 6>this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel like Mark Twain,</v>

2861
02:13:09.221 --> 02:13:14.221
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when they invented the radio and he's </v>

2862
02:13:14.221 --> 02:13:14.221
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh great,</v>

2863
02:13:14.221 --> 02:13:14.221
<v Speaker 6>we still don't have anything to say to </v>
<v Speaker 6>each other.</v>

2864
02:13:14.221 --> 02:13:14.221
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2865
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:16.810
<v Speaker 6>do we not know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2866
02:13:16.811 --> 02:13:18.670
<v Speaker 6>I'm talking about in his time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The point is,</v>

2867
02:13:18.671 --> 02:13:20.550
<v Speaker 6>sounds like you had a hangover when he </v>
<v Speaker 6>said Mark Twain,</v>

2868
02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:24.190
<v Speaker 6>I feel like we're going in the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 6>direction.</v>

2869
02:13:24.191 --> 02:13:27.700
<v Speaker 6>And so every time there's another carrot</v>
<v Speaker 6>dangling out there saying,</v>

2870
02:13:27.701 --> 02:13:29.590
<v Speaker 6>oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're eternal life.</v>

2871
02:13:29.620 --> 02:13:30.700
<v Speaker 6>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's this all.</v>

2872
02:13:30.701 --> 02:13:32.640
<v Speaker 6>You're going to a super hero.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

2873
02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:36.570
<v Speaker 6>it's like the casino guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're almost out of money in the casinos</v>

2874
02:13:36.571 --> 02:13:41.571
<v Speaker 6>guys saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well maybe if you just place a few more </v>

2875
02:13:41.571 --> 02:13:41.571
<v Speaker 6>beds,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2876
02:13:41.571 --> 02:13:41.571
<v Speaker 6>you'll win it all back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But again,</v>

2877
02:13:42.810 --> 02:13:45.680
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't always been the case though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody always thought that the.</v>

2878
02:13:45.810 --> 02:13:48.210
<v Speaker 1>You ever listened to a hunter s Thompson</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking in the 19 seventies.</v>

2879
02:13:48.260 --> 02:13:49.080
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

2880
02:13:49.081 --> 02:13:51.330
<v Speaker 1>It's almost over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking great demise were,</v>

2881
02:13:51.380 --> 02:13:53.280

<v Speaker 1>were skidding into the,</v>

2882
02:13:53.670 --> 02:13:56.820
<v Speaker 1>to the apocalypse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's felt that way was right.</v>

2883
02:13:57.150 --> 02:13:59.480
<v Speaker 1>But he was he still here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look what are we?</v>

<v Speaker 1>but shit shit is always weird</v>

2886
02:14:04.670 --> 02:14:05.560
<v Speaker 6>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cut It.</v>

2887
02:14:05.561 --> 02:14:10.561
<v Speaker 6>Three years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Chris Ryan's going to be 21 and I'll </v>

2888
02:14:10.561 --> 02:14:14.060
<v Speaker 6>shoot myself in the head and you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to be healthy every day.</v>

2889
02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:16.720
<v Speaker 6>Finally banging it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Twenty year old.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I mean you can like philosophically </v>

2894
02:14:29.130 --> 02:14:31.631
<v Speaker 6>break it down as much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If it's going to give me a pill that's </v>

2895
02:14:31.631 --> 02:14:31.631
<v Speaker 6>going to or not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the thing.</v>

2896
02:14:31.631 --> 02:14:34.280
<v Speaker 6>They're just going to tell you they will</v>
<v Speaker 6>to keep you in the game,</v>

2897

<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what about.</v>

2899
02:14:37.580 --> 02:14:40.280
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean you said like everything's always</v>

2900
02:14:40.281 --> 02:14:41.540
<v Speaker 6>about to end,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

2901
02:14:41.541 --> 02:14:45.290
<v Speaker 6>but on the alternatively everything's </v>
<v Speaker 6>always about to be great.</v>

2902
02:14:45.291 --> 02:14:50.291
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the thirties and forties they were </v>

2903
02:14:50.291 --> 02:14:50.291
<v Speaker 6>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2904
02:14:50.291 --> 02:14:50.390
<v Speaker 6>what are we gonna do with all our </v>
<v Speaker 6>leisure time?</v>

2905
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:55.390
<v Speaker 6>The technology is going to give us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to be working three hours a </v>

2906
02:14:55.390 --> 02:14:57.320
<v Speaker 6>week and have jet packs and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>have her food grow out of the table just</v>

2907
02:14:57.321 --> 02:15:00.230
<v Speaker 6>as we're ready to eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>None of that shit ever happens.</v>

2908
02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:05.260
<v Speaker 6>It never happens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're working more hours now than we </v>

2909
02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:05.260
<v Speaker 6>were then.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those standard of living,</v>

2910
02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:06.080
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're talking about hunter s Thompson in</v>

2911
02:15:06.081 --> 02:15:11.081
<v Speaker 6>the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The middle class family now has less </v>

2912
02:15:11.081 --> 02:15:11.620
<v Speaker 6>money than they had in 1970.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2913
02:15:11.630 --> 02:15:15.110
<v Speaker 6>At least they're not dying of </v>
<v Speaker 6>tuberculosis of a,</v>

2914
02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:20.120
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>insulin resistance and that over </v>

2915
02:15:20.120 --> 02:15:21.620
<v Speaker 6>coughing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like spraying blood into my kerchief and</v>

2916
02:15:21.621 --> 02:15:26.621
<v Speaker 6>watching everyone around me wigs are </v>
<v Speaker 6>coming.</v>

2917
02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:29.830
<v Speaker 6>You're really making a big,</v>
<v Speaker 6>big,</v>

2918
02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:33.160
<v Speaker 1>big leap because I don't think it's that</v>
<v Speaker 1>black and white.</v>

2919
02:15:33.161 --> 02:15:35.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that it really is worse.</v>

2920
02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's gotten way better.</v>

2921
02:15:38.381 --> 02:15:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I think for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2922
02:15:39.790 --> 02:15:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Quality of life is still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just too many people,</v>

2923
02:15:42.570 --> 02:15:47.570
<v Speaker 1>a finite amount of resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt economy beyond corrupt </v>

2924
02:15:47.570 --> 02:15:48.970
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those excel good games for x,</v>

2925
02:15:48.971 --> 02:15:50.710
<v Speaker 1>but what about all this stuff that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>said earlier?</v>

2926
02:15:50.711 --> 02:15:52.510
<v Speaker 1>What about all this stuff we said about </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication,</v>

2927
02:15:52.511 --> 02:15:55.480
<v Speaker 1>about the access to information being </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than it's ever been before.</v>

2928
02:15:55.750 --> 02:15:58.540
<v Speaker 1>I think if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more rosy today.</v>

2929
02:15:58.730 --> 02:16:02.740
<v Speaker 1>The view of society and the potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the future more rosy today than it's</v>

2930
02:16:02.741 --> 02:16:05.850
<v Speaker 1>ever been before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Syria thing is a perfect example.</v>

2931
02:16:06.310 --> 02:16:08.530
<v Speaker 1>This is the first time in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>recollection,</v>

2932
02:16:08.740 --> 02:16:11.470
<v Speaker 1>my recollection that the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2933
02:16:11.471 --> 02:16:16.471
<v Speaker 1>the populace stood up when there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposed military action and said fuck </v>

2934
02:16:16.471 --> 02:16:20.911
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a giant percentage of the </v>

2935
02:16:20.911 --> 02:16:21.760
<v Speaker 1>population was so alarmed that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>knuckleheads we were in,</v>

2936
02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:22.780
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey guys,</v>

2937
02:16:22.781 --> 02:16:26.530
<v Speaker 1>this is revolution type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go through with this,</v>

2938
02:16:26.531 --> 02:16:28.960
<v Speaker 1>this is your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the door of a revolution,</v>

2939
02:16:29.110 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 1>and here's the best</v>

2940
02:16:30.010 --> 02:16:31.690
<v Speaker 2>way to keep this revolution from </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

2941
02:16:31.930 --> 02:16:35.590
<v Speaker 2>Keep them calm and the best way to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>them comms and not go into another world</v>

2942
02:16:35.591 --> 02:16:40.591
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys are running to shell games </v>

2943
02:16:40.591 --> 02:16:42.271
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're sucking minerals out of </v>

2944
02:16:42.271 --> 02:16:42.271
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You sucking oil out of Iraq.</v>

2945
02:16:42.271 --> 02:16:44.290
<v Speaker 2>How would everybody just back the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>off and stop trying to invade everything</v>

2946
02:16:44.291 --> 02:16:49.030
<v Speaker 2>all at once and they did and that was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sign of progress.</v>

2947
02:16:49.031 --> 02:16:52.210
<v Speaker 2>I see that as a sign of like so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood has already been lost.</v>

2948
02:16:52.211 --> 02:16:56.050
<v Speaker 2>The body can't bleed anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once a half full guy exhaustion,</v>

2949
02:16:56.500 --> 02:16:59.920
<v Speaker 2>the country's exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broke and people are saying,</v>

2950
02:17:00.350 --> 02:17:01.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't do anymore.</v>

2951
02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:04.420
<v Speaker 2>We get the national guard doing seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>tours in Iraq.</v>

2952
02:17:04.421 --> 02:17:09.421
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the national guard never went anywhere </v>

2953
02:17:09.421 --> 02:17:09.850
<v Speaker 2>overseas until Bush and now we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>accepted that as normal.</v>

2954
02:17:09.851 --> 02:17:14.851
<v Speaker 2>We've got higher percentage of people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>prisons than any country in the world </v>

2955
02:17:14.851 --> 02:17:15.220
<v Speaker 2>than this country ever has before.</v>

2956
02:17:15.230 --> 02:17:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2957
02:17:15.900 --> 02:17:20.900
<v Speaker 2>it's like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think going back to my friend that I </v>

2958
02:17:20.900 --> 02:17:21.490
<v Speaker 2>was talking about earlier in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be a wash,</v>

2959
02:17:21.760 --> 02:17:22.780
<v Speaker 2>it might be the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2960
02:17:22.781 --> 02:17:24.340
<v Speaker 2>the Internet is really cool and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2961
02:17:24.550 --> 02:17:26.930
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prison industrial complex is,</v>

2962
02:17:26.940 --> 02:17:27.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

2963
02:17:27.971 --> 02:17:29.680
<v Speaker 2>it might be cool that we didn't get into</v>
<v Speaker 2>Syria,</v>

2964
02:17:29.681 --> 02:17:34.681
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand were blown up </v>
<v Speaker 2>wedding parties in Yemen from the sky </v>

2965
02:17:34.681 --> 02:17:35.830
<v Speaker 2>and nobody gives a shit because nobody's</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying on our side.</v>

2966
02:17:36.130 --> 02:17:38.710
<v Speaker 2>And you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like maybe it's a wash,</v>

2967
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:42.460
<v Speaker 2>but when people start telling me utopia </v>
<v Speaker 2>is right around the corner,</v>

2968
02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:45.580
<v Speaker 2>my bullshit detector start blinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>really rightly.</v>

2969
02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:49.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily take you Topia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but terminal life,</v>

2970
02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:51.970
<v Speaker 2>super muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2971
02:17:52.110 --> 02:17:54.420
<v Speaker 2>It's a sales pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2972
02:17:54.421 --> 02:17:57.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't agree for something that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna pay off,</v>

2973
02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:02.520
<v Speaker 2>but I don't agree because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you just look at what we </v>

2974
02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:02.520
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we already have superpowers.</v>

2975
02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:04.590
<v Speaker 2>You have God goddamn phone and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to and it answers anyways,</v>

2976
02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:09.660
<v Speaker 2>but are people happier?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are People really happier now than they </v>

2977
02:18:09.660 --> 02:18:09.660
<v Speaker 2>were 50 years ago?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some are,</v>

2978
02:18:09.660 --> 02:18:14.610
<v Speaker 2>some are happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some I don't think you could ever say </v>

2979
02:18:14.610 --> 02:18:17.071
<v Speaker 2>that are people happier because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to generalize about </v>

2980
02:18:17.071 --> 02:18:17.470
<v Speaker 2>just people overall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2981
02:18:17.471 --> 02:18:18.880
<v Speaker 2>what kind of people we talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2982
02:18:19.390 --> 02:18:21.910
<v Speaker 2>you have to take an aggregate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about people in America.</v>

2983
02:18:21.911 --> 02:18:24.130
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People in Nice neighborhoods,</v>

2984
02:18:24.131 --> 02:18:26.710
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about people in poverty </v>
<v Speaker 2>is in progress,</v>

2985
02:18:26.711 --> 02:18:31.711
<v Speaker 2>but if we're talking about progress for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the human race or human species than we </v>

2986
02:18:31.711 --> 02:18:35.671
<v Speaker 2>are talking about all people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to be talking about the </v>

2987
02:18:35.671 --> 02:18:35.671
<v Speaker 2>aggregate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2988
02:18:35.671 --> 02:18:37.360
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that what progress would be?</v>

2989
02:18:37.390 --> 02:18:37.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have.</v>

2990
02:18:38.170 --> 02:18:40.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have influence on your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your immediate environment.</v>

2991
02:18:40.991 --> 02:18:45.991
<v Speaker 2>You have influence on the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're allowed to reach outside your </v>

2992
02:18:45.991 --> 02:18:48.570
<v Speaker 2>immediate environment with technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once you start talking about the </v>

2993
02:18:48.570 --> 02:18:49.180
<v Speaker 2>entire world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're really responsible for that,</v>

2994
02:18:49.181 --> 02:18:51.970
<v Speaker 2>well then all societies have to break </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and we have to start from scratch.</v>

2995
02:18:52.030 --> 02:18:57.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying we're responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying that when people start </v>

2996
02:18:57.030 --> 02:18:57.030
<v Speaker 2>talking about how things are getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

2997
02:18:57.370 --> 02:19:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I think you need to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we need to do is understand,</v>

2998
02:19:00.581 --> 02:19:05.581
<v Speaker 2>define our terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean by better a and </v>

2999
02:19:05.581 --> 02:19:05.740
<v Speaker 2>secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by for us?</v>

3000
02:19:06.640 --> 02:19:08.410
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's better for me.</v>

3001
02:19:08.620 --> 02:19:13.240
<v Speaker 2>I can go on audible.com,</v>
<v Speaker 2>download an audio book of Jack Kornfield</v>

3002
02:19:13.241 --> 02:19:18.241
<v Speaker 2>talking about describing Buddhism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This super simple way that I've never </v>

3003
02:19:18.241 --> 02:19:18.241
<v Speaker 2>heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3004
02:19:18.241 --> 02:19:19.900
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wakes me up to this idea of like,</v>

3005
02:19:19.901 --> 02:19:20.590
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3006
02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:23.290
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to like if I don't love myself,</v>

3007
02:19:23.950 --> 02:19:27.350
<v Speaker 2>if I don't figure out a way to to to to </v>
<v Speaker 2>really embrace myself,</v>

3008
02:19:27.530 --> 02:19:28.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be</v>

3009
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:29.930
<v Speaker 3>a miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are going to be kind of unhappy.</v>

3010
02:19:30.140 --> 02:19:32.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be unhappy for the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 3>my life.</v>

3011
02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:37.600
<v Speaker 3>So are things are getting better because</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have access to information that can </v>

3012
02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:40.730
<v Speaker 3>improve our internal states and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>once you're happy,</v>

3013
02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:43.460
<v Speaker 3>all the innovation can be enjoyed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're.</v>

3014
02:19:43.470 --> 02:19:44.170
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you.</v>

3015
02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:49.180
<v Speaker 3>If so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying that the access to </v>

3016
02:19:49.180 --> 02:19:49.250
<v Speaker 3>information now is so much greater than </v>
<v Speaker 3>it ever was.</v>

3017
02:19:49.251 --> 02:19:52.760
<v Speaker 3>That if somebody really wants to plug in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and transform themselves,</v>

3018
02:19:52.761 --> 02:19:55.250
<v Speaker 3>they can and that's better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's better.</v>

3019
02:19:55.430 --> 02:19:57.740
<v Speaker 3>But another point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Buddhism,</v>

3020
02:19:57.741 --> 02:20:00.500
<v Speaker 3>there's an idea of something called </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental dissatisfaction,</v>

3021
02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:03.830
<v Speaker 3>which comes from being a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't matter what time you were</v>

3022
02:20:03.831 --> 02:20:06.320
<v Speaker 3>born into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter where you were born or</v>

3023
02:20:06.470 --> 02:20:08.810
<v Speaker 3>if you're born in a futuristic society </v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

3024
02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:12.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you never will age and flying android,</v>

3025
02:20:12.741 --> 02:20:17.741
<v Speaker 3>blowjob machines come down the moment </v>
<v Speaker 3>they detect any type of horniness from </v>

3026
02:20:17.741 --> 02:20:20.180
<v Speaker 3>your neural patterns and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and make you come.</v>

3027
02:20:20.390 --> 02:20:22.940
<v Speaker 3>You're still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't deal with your internal,</v>

3028
02:20:22.941 --> 02:20:24.190
<v Speaker 3>if you don't deal with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3029
02:20:24.191 --> 02:20:29.191
<v Speaker 3>the basic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental problem of being a human </v>

3030
02:20:29.191 --> 02:20:30.020
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that life is suffering.</v>

3031
02:20:30.170 --> 02:20:32.450
<v Speaker 3>If you don't deal with your attachment </v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

3032
02:20:32.451 --> 02:20:33.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

3033
02:20:33.350 --> 02:20:35.840
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to your ego and your identity,</v>

3034
02:20:35.930 --> 02:20:38.630
<v Speaker 3>you're going to suffer no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that doesn't change.</v>

3035
02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:41.390
<v Speaker 3>That's just part of being a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3036
02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:44.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think it's more interesting time,</v>

3037
02:20:44.450 --> 02:20:47.030
<v Speaker 3>better lotions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more interesting.</v>

3038
02:20:50.260 --> 02:20:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Cars go faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero to 60 times a down.</v>

3039
02:20:53.360 --> 02:20:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3040
02:20:54.770 --> 02:20:59.020
<v Speaker 1>I think the potential for expansion is </v>
<v Speaker 1>monstrous.</v>

3041
02:20:59.050 --> 02:21:03.010
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the the potential for </v>
<v Speaker 1>information to get to you,</v>

3042
02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:06.010
<v Speaker 1>the possibilities of it getting to or </v>
<v Speaker 1>greater than it's ever been before,</v>

3043
02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:10.780
<v Speaker 1>the access to knowledge is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And putting it all together and making a</v>

3044
02:21:10.781 --> 02:21:14.380
<v Speaker 1>package as a happy human being is always</v>
<v Speaker 1>a difficult pursuit.</v>

3045
02:21:14.590 --> 02:21:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Always will be even more complicated now</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's an increasing amount of </v>

3046
02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:22.450
<v Speaker 1>variables and it staggeringly increased </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of variable and you can only.</v>

3047
02:21:22.451 --> 02:21:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a bottleneck.</v>

3048
02:21:24.130 --> 02:21:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more information than ever </v>

3049
02:21:29.130 --> 02:21:31.051
<v Speaker 1>before and I completely agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your brain still has to processes </v>

3050
02:21:31.051 --> 02:21:34.680
<v Speaker 1>and they can only go a certain speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's where the shit like this </v>

3051
02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:35.330
<v Speaker 1>terminator star muscle comes in because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna,</v>

3052
02:21:35.460 --> 02:21:37.550
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna move into the neuro field,</v>

3053
02:21:37.810 --> 02:21:41.680
<v Speaker 1>they're going to implant muscles and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying they're able to create an</v>

3054
02:21:41.710 --> 02:21:46.400
<v Speaker 1>artificial style muscle that place your </v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles.</v>

3055
02:21:46.420 --> 02:21:47.700
<v Speaker 1>They're implying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3056
02:21:47.970 --> 02:21:52.970
<v Speaker 1>this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the very early stages of </v>

3057
02:21:52.970 --> 02:21:55.441
<v Speaker 1>anything that would apply to a robot or </v>
<v Speaker 1>to whatever the fuck they're going to </v>

3058
02:21:55.441 --> 02:21:58.141
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But essentially they're trying to mimic </v>

3059
02:21:58.141 --> 02:21:59.260
<v Speaker 1>what the possibilities of muscle tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3060
02:21:59.360 --> 02:22:04.360
<v Speaker 1>there's another one that I've done where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they combined spider silk with human </v>

3061
02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:06.430
<v Speaker 1>human skin to create some artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>bulletproof skin.</v>

3062
02:22:06.460 --> 02:22:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Spiderman today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just these.</v>

3063
02:22:10.060 --> 02:22:15.040
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating to watch people break </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the very structure of reality.</v>

3064
02:22:15.340 --> 02:22:18.940
<v Speaker 1>They're very compounds of the various </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of life,</v>

3065
02:22:19.240 --> 02:22:22.180
<v Speaker 1>whether it's flesh or bone or cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

3066
02:22:22.780 --> 02:22:25.770
<v Speaker 1>The brain itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've created artificial brain cells.</v>

3067
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:30.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are like literally miss </v>
<v Speaker 1>things or materializing and it's going </v>

3068
02:22:30.980 --> 02:22:35.130
<v Speaker 1>to be any credible puzzle that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to solve as far as our possibilities for</v>

3069
02:22:35.131 --> 02:22:40.131
<v Speaker 1>altering our environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But none of it matters if we're not </v>

3070
02:22:40.131 --> 02:22:42.910
<v Speaker 1>getting information about government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the inner workings of corporations</v>

3071
02:22:42.911 --> 02:22:44.430
<v Speaker 1>and because these are the people.</v>

3072
02:22:44.460 --> 02:22:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Those are the institutions that unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not getting more,</v>

3073
02:22:47.851 --> 02:22:50.340
<v Speaker 1>we're not our access to good information</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

3074
02:22:50.410 --> 02:22:55.410
<v Speaker 1>about what's really going on is </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed by the Internet because the </v>

3075
02:22:55.410 --> 02:22:59.391
<v Speaker 1>Internet has killed journalism sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't the real problem with all </v>

3076
02:22:59.391 --> 02:23:04.050
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's corporations that give </v>

3077
02:23:04.050 --> 02:23:05.310
<v Speaker 1>money to lobbyists that give money to </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians and influence isn't.</v>

3078
02:23:05.311 --> 02:23:08.190
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is that it's not clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>and obvious what's going on.</v>

3079
02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:12.210
<v Speaker 1>People are slowly starting to unveil all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these issues of corruption.</v>

3080
02:23:12.390 --> 02:23:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the boundaries between people in </v>

3081
02:23:17.390 --> 02:23:18.750
<v Speaker 1>information becomes smaller and smaller </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where there's no boundary.</v>

3082
02:23:18.910 --> 02:23:23.910
<v Speaker 1>If everyone's going to be accountable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be accountable for </v>

3083
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:23.910
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including corporations.</v>

3084
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Corporations are going to be accountable</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their actions.</v>

3085
02:23:25.940 --> 02:23:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Who's but who's going to do that work?</v>

3086
02:23:28.230 --> 02:23:33.230
<v Speaker 6>Who's going to go to the board meetings </v>
<v Speaker 6>and record who voted for what and where </v>

3087
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.290
<v Speaker 6>the money's going.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's journalism.</v>

3088
02:23:33.370 --> 02:23:35.130
<v Speaker 1>That's if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no money in journals.</v>

3089
02:23:35.131 --> 02:23:37.660
<v Speaker 1>If you live today in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the case.</v>

3090
02:23:37.930 --> 02:23:40.750
<v Speaker 1>I think the world where we live in in </v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

3091
02:23:40.751 --> 02:23:41.560
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>

3092
02:23:41.561 --> 02:23:43.720
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's gonna be no secrets.</v>

3093
02:23:43.870 --> 02:23:45.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be like the board has </v>
<v Speaker 1>to meet.</v>

3094
02:23:45.881 --> 02:23:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's going to know in the on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole planet what the corporation's been</v>

3095
02:23:49.721 --> 02:23:52.150
<v Speaker 1>up to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the ramifications of this,</v>

3096
02:23:52.330 --> 02:23:57.330
<v Speaker 1>who's profited from this directly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bradley Manning's are going to win </v>

3097
02:23:57.791 --> 02:24:01.870
<v Speaker 1>out over the NSA percent for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3098
02:24:03.420 --> 02:24:08.420
<v Speaker 6>Greenwald.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just listened to him on the way over </v>

3099
02:24:08.420 --> 02:24:08.420
<v Speaker 6>here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was listening to him,</v>

3100
02:24:08.420 --> 02:24:11.900
<v Speaker 6>he was talking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was at Marxism conference or </v>

3101
02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:15.351
<v Speaker 6>something and he was talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 6>he was on meet the press and how David </v>

3102
02:24:16.500 --> 02:24:21.500
<v Speaker 6>Gregory essentially called for him to be</v>
<v Speaker 6>arrested and put in prison for being a </v>

3103
02:24:22.231 --> 02:24:23.520
<v Speaker 6>journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Unbelievable.</v>

3104
02:24:23.521 --> 02:24:28.521
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and David Gregory himself is completely </v>

3105
02:24:28.521 --> 02:24:31.431
<v Speaker 6>complicit in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in selectively using the leaks that are </v>

3106
02:24:31.431 --> 02:24:32.550
<v Speaker 6>given to him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3107
02:24:32.551 --> 02:24:34.740
<v Speaker 6>Which is what he was accusing Greenwald </v>
<v Speaker 6>of having done,</v>

3108
02:24:34.741 --> 02:24:36.900
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>utilize a leak and writing your story.</v>

3109
02:24:37.140 --> 02:24:39.630
<v Speaker 6>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what David does every week,</v>

3110
02:24:39.900 --> 02:24:41.430
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>at some dinner party,</v>

3111
02:24:41.431 --> 02:24:44.790
<v Speaker 6>somebody mentioned something to him that</v>
<v Speaker 6>they want to be disseminated.</v>

3112
02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:49.990
<v Speaker 6>That's all those guys do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he described them as actors playing </v>

3113
02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:52.941
<v Speaker 6>journalists on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I mean going Greenwald's one of the </v>

3114
02:24:52.941 --> 02:24:52.941
<v Speaker 6>only ones out there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3115
02:24:52.941 --> 02:24:54.100
<v Speaker 6>Jeremy Scahill I</v>

3116
02:24:54.370 --> 02:24:55.870
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the Internet is destroyed.</v>

3117
02:24:55.871 --> 02:24:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Journalism journalism destroyed itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet has created real journalism</v>

3118
02:24:59.581 --> 02:25:04.581
<v Speaker 1>and the Internet has given birth to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally new style of journalism that's </v>

3119
02:25:04.581 --> 02:25:05.560
<v Speaker 1>not connected to the machine that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually viewer supported.</v>

3120
02:25:05.561 --> 02:25:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's shows like the young Turks </v>
<v Speaker 1>or podcasts or anything,</v>

3121
02:25:09.730 --> 02:25:14.730
<v Speaker 1>what you're getting is a viewer </v>
<v Speaker 1>supported experience where there's no </v>

3122
02:25:14.730 --> 02:25:18.301
<v Speaker 1>incentive to lie to you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The incentive is actually to tell the </v>

3123
02:25:18.301 --> 02:25:21.721
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These shifts are you can't ignore them </v>

3124
02:25:21.721 --> 02:25:25.750
<v Speaker 1>and there's this new access and this new</v>
<v Speaker 1>thirst for information.</v>

3125
02:25:25.751 --> 02:25:29.380
<v Speaker 1>It's very different than anything any </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture has ever experienced before.</v>

3126
02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:31.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you could take it lightly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think.</v>

3127
02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:37.680
<v Speaker 1>I think ultimately it spells progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it spells outrage and outrage </v>

3128
02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:39.820
<v Speaker 1>over corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once there's a balance,</v>

3129
02:25:39.821 --> 02:25:43.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a yin and a Yang when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to government and once there's a balance</v>

3130
02:25:43.121 --> 02:25:48.121
<v Speaker 1>in the corruption has been least forced </v>
<v Speaker 1>to relinquish its grasp.</v>

3131
02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Whether prosecuted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether people will go to have to go to </v>

3132
02:25:54.640 --> 02:25:54.700
<v Speaker 1>jail for the way they've been running </v>
<v Speaker 1>this society is debatable.</v>

3133
02:25:54.990 --> 02:25:59.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what the law used to be at a </v>

3134
02:25:59.990 --> 02:25:59.990
<v Speaker 1>certain point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3135
02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:00.490
<v Speaker 1>None of this torture guys are anywhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>near a jail,</v>

3136
02:26:00.520 --> 02:26:03.490
<v Speaker 1>but there's no debate that it's got all </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

3137
02:26:03.530 --> 02:26:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Whether whether it comes from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it comes from.</v>

3138
02:26:05.921 --> 02:26:10.390
<v Speaker 1>There was a recent story about how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug war is a complete and total fucking</v>

3139
02:26:10.391 --> 02:26:15.391
<v Speaker 1>joke based on the fact that these banks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been caught laundering money.</v>

3140
02:26:15.611 --> 02:26:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Did you read this in Florida?</v>
<v Speaker 1>UBC?</v>

3141
02:26:18.460 --> 02:26:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Billions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3142
02:26:20.081 --> 02:26:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

3143
02:26:21.170 --> 02:26:23.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll pull it up because it's such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy,</v>

3144
02:26:23.921 --> 02:26:25.930
<v Speaker 1>crazy story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you,</v>

3145
02:26:25.931 --> 02:26:27.490
<v Speaker 1>when you read it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

3146
02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:31.000
<v Speaker 1>it shows you that the idea of a drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

3147
02:26:31.001 --> 02:26:35.530
<v Speaker 1>of the fact that they're trying to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs from coming in nonsense.</v>

3148
02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:37.390
<v Speaker 1>They're just trying to arrest black </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

3149
02:26:37.540 --> 02:26:42.540
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to fill up jails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They trying to make it so that the </v>

3150
02:26:42.540 --> 02:26:45.781
<v Speaker 1>people who are in control of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution stay in control of the </v>

3151
02:26:45.781 --> 02:26:47.680
<v Speaker 1>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's madness.</v>

3152
02:26:49.090 --> 02:26:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3153
02:26:50.021 --> 02:26:55.021
<v Speaker 1>I always feel like I'm raining on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>parade when I talked to you two guys </v>

3154
02:26:55.021 --> 02:26:55.021
<v Speaker 1>because you're so hopeful for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

3155
02:26:55.021 --> 02:26:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I think you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3156
02:26:55.520 --> 02:26:57.010
<v Speaker 1>you've just seen more than we have.</v>

3157
02:26:59.820 --> 02:27:02.450
<v Speaker 3>You've been to more places to see me or </v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck and educated.</v>

3158
02:27:02.650 --> 02:27:04.170
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so great,</v>

3159
02:27:04.171 --> 02:27:06.090
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because like it's so you need that.</v>

3160
02:27:06.091 --> 02:27:08.010
<v Speaker 3>You need balance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good to have balance,</v>

3161
02:27:08.011 --> 02:27:09.360
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want an echo chamber,</v>

3162
02:27:09.361 --> 02:27:14.361
<v Speaker 3>you need somebody who's going to throw </v>
<v Speaker 3>out the facts and [inaudible] in that </v>

3163
02:27:14.361 --> 02:27:15.270
<v Speaker 3>process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you'll,</v>

3164
02:27:15.350 --> 02:27:16.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

3165
02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:20.700
<v Speaker 3>are we headed towards some utopian </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality or some Utopian future?</v>

3166
02:27:20.701 --> 02:27:22.950
<v Speaker 3>I'd say the odds of that are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>slim.</v>

3167
02:27:23.220 --> 02:27:24.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>

3168
02:27:24.841 --> 02:27:29.841
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as people are caught up in </v>

3169
02:27:29.841 --> 02:27:30.630
<v Speaker 3>themselves as an individual instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>recognizing they're part of a whole,</v>

3170
02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:33.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>regardless of any kind of innovation,</v>

3171
02:27:33.470 --> 02:27:35.850
<v Speaker 3>there's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's always going to create problems.</v>

3172
02:27:35.851 --> 02:27:40.851
<v Speaker 3>But I do think there's some beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>things on the horizon that are just </v>

3173
02:27:40.851 --> 02:27:40.851
<v Speaker 3>going to be wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

3174
02:27:40.851 --> 02:27:45.610
<v Speaker 3>throw the thing of these conversations </v>
<v Speaker 3>get complicated because anyone I'm </v>

3175
02:27:45.610 --> 02:27:47.040
<v Speaker 3>talking to always says something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3176
02:27:47.041 --> 02:27:49.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to have tuberculosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or there are good things on the horizon.</v>

3177
02:27:50.100 --> 02:27:52.560
<v Speaker 3>That's all true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I'm talking about right</v>

3178
02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:56.090
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the general trajectory of our species</v>

3179
02:27:56.091 --> 02:27:59.450
<v Speaker 1>trip through time going in a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction or a bad director?</v>

3180
02:27:59.470 --> 02:28:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you before anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3181
02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rolling stone article is a </v>

3182
02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:07.880
<v Speaker 1>outrageous SBC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>HSBC settlement proves that the drug war</v>

3183
02:28:07.881 --> 02:28:09.520
<v Speaker 1>is a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's by Matt Matt Taibbi.</v>

3184
02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:14.590
<v Speaker 1>He's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Best Thompson even better because </v>

3185
02:28:14.590 --> 02:28:15.510
<v Speaker 1>he's more prolific and he's not fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up on meth.</v>

3186
02:28:16.470 --> 02:28:17.570
<v Speaker 1>My title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3187
02:28:17.571 --> 02:28:20.570
<v Speaker 1>you gotta read my greatest journalists </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>

3188

<v Speaker 2>octopus squid.</v>

3190
02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:27.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I was gonna say is that in my world</v>

3191
02:28:27.891 --> 02:28:30.440
<v Speaker 2>it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're saying this society better,</v>

3192
02:28:30.500 --> 02:28:32.840
<v Speaker 2>well I only as applied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3193
02:28:32.841 --> 02:28:34.520
<v Speaker 2>but in my world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>

3194
02:28:34.990 --> 02:28:36.020
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at us.</v>

3195
02:28:36.130 --> 02:28:38.790
<v Speaker 2>We're three guys dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3196
02:28:38.810 --> 02:28:43.160
<v Speaker 2>with three beautiful muscular men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>magical white people were magical way.</v>

3197
02:28:43.161 --> 02:28:45.440
<v Speaker 2>People with no job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3198
02:28:45.441 --> 02:28:48.860
<v Speaker 2>None of us is punching a clock anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the people who are listening to</v>

3199
02:28:48.861 --> 02:28:51.710
<v Speaker 2>this or sitting in a cubicle somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're working 40,</v>

3200
02:28:51.711 --> 02:28:53.240
<v Speaker 2>50 hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get home,</v>

3201
02:28:53.241 --> 02:28:56.330
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have time to read Matt Taibbi</v>

3202
02:28:56.331 --> 02:29:01.331
<v Speaker 2>because they got to like change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>diapers and the kid and take the other </v>

3203
02:29:01.331 --> 02:29:02.780
<v Speaker 2>one to soccer and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay the alimony and it's like,</v>

3204
02:29:03.190 --> 02:29:07.610
<v Speaker 2>I think it's really important that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have.</v>

3205
02:29:07.880 --> 02:29:12.880
<v Speaker 2>We don't forget how incredibly fortunate</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are and what an amazing pinnacle we </v>

3206
02:29:13.521 --> 02:29:16.910
<v Speaker 2>happen to be standing on looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience that said,</v>

3207
02:29:17.090 --> 02:29:19.040
<v Speaker 2>you figured it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you figured it out.</v>

3208
02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:21.950
<v Speaker 2>I figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we are in our world.</v>

3209
02:29:22.010 --> 02:29:25.070
<v Speaker 2>The world is better today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we're just really lucky.</v>

3210
02:29:25.130 --> 02:29:26.020
<v Speaker 2>Or we're living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3211
02:29:26.021 --> 02:29:31.021
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what we figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't we embrace the simulation </v>

3212
02:29:31.021 --> 02:29:33.020
<v Speaker 2>theory that this simulation that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>all subscribed to.</v>

3213
02:29:33.260 --> 02:29:37.710
<v Speaker 2>We jumped into a really good simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have jobs and uh,</v>

3214
02:29:38.330 --> 02:29:41.290
<v Speaker 2>like the world is a Goddamn Hologram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been proven that.</v>

3215
02:29:41.330 --> 02:29:42.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was last week,</v>

3216
02:29:42.561 --> 02:29:43.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hologram.</v>

3217
02:29:43.551 --> 02:29:45.320
<v Speaker 2>The universe is a Hologram Dunkin.</v>

3218
02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:50.720
<v Speaker 3>Some is something at the retreat they </v>
<v Speaker 3>said that they were talking about this </v>

3219
02:29:50.720 --> 02:29:51.390
<v Speaker 3>thing broke you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved it.</v>

3220
02:29:51.790 --> 02:29:53.290
<v Speaker 3>Here's something they said I really </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3221
02:29:53.291 --> 02:29:58.291
<v Speaker 3>which is because it's this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're doing the starving African child </v>

3222
02:29:58.291 --> 02:30:01.261
<v Speaker 3>thing where it's like there's always </v>
<v Speaker 3>this starving African child to think </v>

3223
02:30:01.261 --> 02:30:01.860
<v Speaker 3>about when you're too happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is,</v>

3224
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:07.230
<v Speaker 3>if you really want to honor and respect </v>
<v Speaker 3>the suffering of the world and people </v>

3225
02:30:07.230 --> 02:30:11.941
<v Speaker 3>who are trapped in various predicaments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest thing you could do is not </v>

3226
02:30:11.941 --> 02:30:13.750
<v Speaker 3>feel guilty about your own happiness</v>

3227
02:30:14.380 --> 02:30:15.160
<v Speaker 2>ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit.</v>

3228
02:30:15.190 --> 02:30:18.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel guilty about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guilt to me.</v>

3229
02:30:18.970 --> 02:30:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>conception of how he should be and like </v>

3258
02:31:30.880 --> 02:31:32.430
<v Speaker 4>in this documentary there's a story </v>
<v Speaker 4>where he's onstage with some,</v>

<v Speaker 4>He's acting drunk and he's wasted.</v>

3262
02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:46.050
<v Speaker 4>And like after the talk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's in the hallway walking with some of</v>

<v Speaker 4>He was acting drunk.</v>

3266
02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:54.150
<v Speaker 4>He was doing this because he was fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>around with like,</v>

3267
02:31:54.180 --> 02:31:59.180
<v Speaker 4>he was trying to create a contrast </v>
<v Speaker 4>between this guy who apparently like </v>

3268
02:31:59.180 --> 02:32:00.510
<v Speaker 4>considered himself to be a very buttoned</v>
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>

3269
02:32:00.511 --> 02:32:03.750
<v Speaker 4>very spiritual spiritual man and him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just like,</v>

3270
02:32:03.751 --> 02:32:05.610
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can do whatever I want.</v>

3271
02:32:05.820 --> 02:32:10.820
<v Speaker 4>I can be whoever I want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to act like I'm holy or </v>

3272
02:32:10.820 --> 02:32:11.160
<v Speaker 4>sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3273
02:32:11.161 --> 02:32:13.260
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to act like a spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

3274
02:32:13.470 --> 02:32:18.470
<v Speaker 4>I can be a drunk guy who humps hippies </v>
<v Speaker 4>and still be a spiritual teacher and </v>

3275
02:32:18.631 --> 02:32:21.600
<v Speaker 4>still have something to offer the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a beautiful thing,</v>

3276
02:32:21.601 --> 02:32:21.870
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3277
02:32:21.910 --> 02:32:25.450
<v Speaker 1>It is a beautiful thing except that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be drunk.</v>

3278
02:32:25.840 --> 02:32:28.690
<v Speaker 1>I never side with the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be drunk.</v>

3279
02:32:29.020 --> 02:32:32.470
<v Speaker 1>I always suspect foul play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're pretending to be drunk.</v>

3280
02:32:32.471 --> 02:32:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Why would you pretend to be drunk or </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend to be anything else?</v>

3281
02:32:35.690 --> 02:32:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Why your documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever seen comics </v>

<v Speaker 1>pretend it's Tequila onstage now.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I can't defend it because attack is.</v>

3287
02:32:51.621 --> 02:32:52.460
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do.</v>

3288
02:32:52.461 --> 02:32:54.630
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't when he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he was one of the first.</v>

3289
02:32:54.860 --> 02:32:56.960
<v Speaker 4>He wasn't at the fucking Improv.</v>

3292
02:33:01.460 --> 02:33:02.680
<v Speaker 4>He was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was.</v>

<v Speaker 4>so I don't know why I'm getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>defensive.</v>

3296

3302
02:33:20.010 --> 02:33:21.770
<v Speaker 4>of not giving a shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is one of my pet theories.</v>

3303
02:33:21.771 --> 02:33:26.771
<v Speaker 4>Recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the only power we get that </v>

3304
02:33:26.771 --> 02:33:26.771
<v Speaker 4>that actually becomes stronger as we </v>
<v Speaker 4>age,</v>

3305
02:33:26.771 --> 02:33:29.460
<v Speaker 4>but how you guys not giving a shit if </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's pretending to be drunk.</v>

3306
02:33:29.460 --> 02:33:31.330
<v Speaker 4>He obviously gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I.</v>

3307
02:33:31.350 --> 02:33:33.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to say he had on show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3308
02:33:33.260 --> 02:33:36.200
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't give a shit about his </v>
<v Speaker 4>reputation as a spiritual guru,</v>

3309
02:33:36.230 --> 02:33:41.230
<v Speaker 4>so he's making a fool of himself </v>
<v Speaker 4>intentionally to demonstrate the fact </v>

3310
02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:42.410
<v Speaker 4>that he's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of these gurus,</v>

3311
02:33:42.411 --> 02:33:43.430
<v Speaker 4>that's what they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3312
02:33:43.431 --> 02:33:48.431
<v Speaker 4>That's part of what they do is they get </v>
<v Speaker 4>around people and they do some </v>

3313
02:33:48.431 --> 02:33:51.221
<v Speaker 4>incredibly untraditional,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird thing that doesn't seem to make </v>

3314
02:33:51.221 --> 02:33:54.581
<v Speaker 4>much sense or really like affects the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who watch them and it usually is </v>

3315
02:33:54.581 --> 02:33:57.620
<v Speaker 4>a way to like point out you're your own </v>
<v Speaker 4>like ego and you're where you're stuck.</v>

3316
02:33:57.830 --> 02:34:00.380
<v Speaker 4>That's the idea and you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a leap of faith.</v>

3317
02:34:00.381 --> 02:34:02.480
<v Speaker 4>Like was Chogyam Trungpa doing that on </v>
<v Speaker 4>purpose?</v>

3318
02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:07.520
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he was really drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you just wasn't having a good </v>

3319
02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:08.180
<v Speaker 4>night or maybe he wasn't doing it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he had a weird sense of humor.</v>

3320
02:34:08.390 --> 02:34:13.390
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But all you can say is this guy put out </v>

3321
02:34:13.390 --> 02:34:16.421
<v Speaker 4>some amazing fucking books that really </v>
<v Speaker 4>break down Tibetan Buddhism and also </v>

3322
02:34:16.421 --> 02:34:17.770
<v Speaker 4>like some of his disciples,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like children,</v>

3323
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:21.010
<v Speaker 4>they're amazing teachers and they asked </v>
<v Speaker 4>her about him,</v>

3324
02:34:21.270 --> 02:34:26.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did she think about him being a </v>

3325
02:34:26.270 --> 02:34:26.270
<v Speaker 4>boozer drinking and she's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what can I say?</v>

3326
02:34:26.470 --> 02:34:29.500
<v Speaker 4>He was a great teacher and he taught me </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Dharma.</v>

3327
02:34:29.501 --> 02:34:30.820
<v Speaker 4>He taught me Buddhism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like,</v>

3328
02:34:31.050 --> 02:34:32.620
<v Speaker 4>how can I judge?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3329
02:34:32.621 --> 02:34:34.810
<v Speaker 4>That's just what he was like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really cool,</v>

3330
02:34:34.811 --> 02:34:35.350
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

3331
02:34:35.590 --> 02:34:38.020
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in Tibet and Buddhism,</v>

3332
02:34:38.021 --> 02:34:43.021
<v Speaker 4>one of the progenitors of it was a t </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lopa was his name and this was a,</v>

3333
02:34:44.081 --> 02:34:49.081
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would go out and try to gather </v>

3334
02:34:49.081 --> 02:34:49.081
<v Speaker 4>information about Buddhism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this guy,</v>

3335
02:34:49.081 --> 02:34:50.290
<v Speaker 4>I think his name was Marva,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that right?</v>

3336
02:34:50.291 --> 02:34:52.890
<v Speaker 4>Mark Miller.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Miller Miller up.</v>

3337
02:34:52.930 --> 02:34:55.050
<v Speaker 4>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if there's very rapey.</v>

3338
02:34:55.120 --> 02:34:57.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you had EPA.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3339
02:34:57.230 --> 02:34:58.530
<v Speaker 4>Milarapa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reva.</v>

3340
02:34:58.750 --> 02:35:02.300
<v Speaker 4>He was like wandering to try to gather </v>
<v Speaker 4>information about Buddhism and uh,</v>

3341
02:35:02.620 --> 02:35:03.250
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3342
02:35:03.251 --> 02:35:05.590
<v Speaker 4>he kept asking who can teach me this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can give me,</v>

3343
02:35:05.591 --> 02:35:10.591
<v Speaker 4>you can really teach me about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so they told him where there's this </v>

3344
02:35:10.591 --> 02:35:10.591
<v Speaker 4>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he lopa in this fishing village,</v>

3345
02:35:10.591 --> 02:35:11.460
<v Speaker 4>you can go there and talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>

3346
02:35:11.461 --> 02:35:14.440
<v Speaker 4>he's an awakened being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he gets there and he like,</v>

3347
02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:19.920
<v Speaker 4>as people do you know if this st t dot </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lopa this enlightened being and they're </v>

3348
02:35:19.920 --> 02:35:22.900
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know that the filthy homeless guy who</v>

3349
02:35:22.901 --> 02:35:25.390
<v Speaker 4>lives down by the river and eats fish </v>
<v Speaker 4>scraps,</v>

3350
02:35:25.420 --> 02:35:30.420
<v Speaker 4>is that who you want to find any?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes to this guy and the guy </v>

3351
02:35:30.420 --> 02:35:32.950
<v Speaker 4>proceeds to torture him for years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>years and years,</v>

3352
02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:35.500
<v Speaker 4>and like finally at the end of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole process,</v>

3353
02:35:35.501 --> 02:35:40.501
<v Speaker 4>and there's all these stories about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>various means that this guy used to </v>

3354
02:35:40.501 --> 02:35:40.501
<v Speaker 4>teach him the final transmission.</v>

3355
02:35:40.501 --> 02:35:45.360
<v Speaker 4>He slapped him in the face with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Sandal and that was like the big </v>

3356
02:35:45.360 --> 02:35:48.781
<v Speaker 4>download that he got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so the whole point of it all this </v>

3357
02:35:48.781 --> 02:35:50.170
<v Speaker 4>mythology or half mythology or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>it is,</v>

3358
02:35:50.171 --> 02:35:55.171
<v Speaker 4>is that if you let your ego decide what </v>
<v Speaker 4>a teacher is going to look like,</v>

3359
02:35:55.960 --> 02:36:00.960
<v Speaker 4>then you are not going to see a real </v>
<v Speaker 4>teacher when they cross your path </v>

3360
02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:04.230
<v Speaker 4>because you've already decided they wear</v>
<v Speaker 4>robes or they don't wear robes or </v>

3361
02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:05.860
<v Speaker 4>they're in shape or they're not in shape</v>
<v Speaker 4>or they're this or they're that.</v>

3362
02:36:06.070 --> 02:36:11.070
<v Speaker 4>The moment you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've cut out so much in the world and </v>

3363
02:36:11.070 --> 02:36:15.841
<v Speaker 4>that's what's really cool about a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Buddhism and all these stories is that </v>

3364
02:36:15.841 --> 02:36:18.160
<v Speaker 4>quite often the teacher was never who </v>
<v Speaker 4>you expected it to be.</v>

3365
02:36:18.340 --> 02:36:22.210
<v Speaker 4>It was always a person who went way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>way against what you thought.</v>

3366
02:36:22.300 --> 02:36:27.300
<v Speaker 4>Somebody who was awake in might be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there's something really beautiful </v>

3367
02:36:27.300 --> 02:36:28.540
<v Speaker 4>about that because if you knew what </v>
<v Speaker 4>awakened beings look like,</v>

3368
02:36:28.660 --> 02:36:30.430
<v Speaker 4>then you would be awakened yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't you?</v>

3369
02:36:30.431 --> 02:36:35.431
<v Speaker 4>And you wouldn't really need anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you already have it all figured </v>

3370
02:36:35.431 --> 02:36:38.401
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So awakened being slapped in the face </v>

3371
02:36:38.401 --> 02:36:38.401
<v Speaker 4>with the Sandal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>awakened beings,</v>

3372
02:36:38.401 --> 02:36:42.190
<v Speaker 4>awakened beings apparently do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes to,</v>

3373
02:36:42.220 --> 02:36:46.330
<v Speaker 4>to wake up the other beings around them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the essence of a Koan.</v>

3374
02:36:46.331 --> 02:36:46.870
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All this.</v>

3375
02:36:47.380 --> 02:36:51.380
<v Speaker 4>What's the hand one answer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Slapping one sandal.</v>

3376
02:36:51.390 --> 02:36:52.370
<v Speaker 4>Slough it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

3377
02:36:53.050 --> 02:36:55.300
<v Speaker 6>you remind me of this German guy I met </v>
<v Speaker 6>in India,</v>

3378
02:36:55.380 --> 02:36:56.860
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>years ago.</v>

3379
02:36:57.340 --> 02:37:02.340
<v Speaker 6>I just met him in a cafe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just some guy had been living in India </v>

3380
02:37:02.340 --> 02:37:05.011
<v Speaker 6>for a long time and we were getting </v>
<v Speaker 6>drunk and he told me this story when he </v>

3381
02:37:05.011 --> 02:37:09.091
<v Speaker 6>was young and first arrived in India.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He found his teacher who didn't speak </v>

3382
02:37:09.761 --> 02:37:11.410
<v Speaker 6>any German or English.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3383
02:37:11.411 --> 02:37:14.030
<v Speaker 6>But he just saw this guy in Varanasi and</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was like,</v>

3384
02:37:14.040 --> 02:37:16.400
<v Speaker 6>that's the guy that's the guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to teach me.</v>

3385
02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:21.670
<v Speaker 6>And he started following this guy and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the guy for weeks and the guy was just </v>

3386
02:37:21.670 --> 02:37:22.010
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who are you?</v>

3387
02:37:22.011 --> 02:37:23.750
<v Speaker 6>Get away from me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why are you following me?</v>

3388
02:37:24.080 --> 02:37:26.180
<v Speaker 6>And he just followed this guy all </v>
<v Speaker 6>through India.</v>

3389
02:37:26.450 --> 02:37:31.450
<v Speaker 6>And then finally like he was washing his</v>
<v Speaker 6>robes and he fucked up the robe somehow </v>

3390
02:37:31.791 --> 02:37:36.791
<v Speaker 6>in the wash.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so then this guru had like weird </v>

3391
02:37:36.791 --> 02:37:36.791
<v Speaker 6>robes that weren't the right color.</v>

3392
02:37:36.791 --> 02:37:41.260
<v Speaker 6>And he then eventually he let this </v>
<v Speaker 6>German guy wear a robe and the German </v>

3393
02:37:41.271 --> 02:37:44.810
<v Speaker 6>guys sort of ingratiated just like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>stray dog won't leave you alone.</v>

3394
02:37:45.350 --> 02:37:47.900
<v Speaker 6>And he never understood what the guy was</v>
<v Speaker 6>saying.</v>

3395
02:37:47.901 --> 02:37:51.050
<v Speaker 6>He just felt there was something in his </v>
<v Speaker 6>eyes that would be transmitted to him if</v>

3396
02:37:51.051 --> 02:37:54.890
<v Speaker 6>he stuck with him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And eventually because the white guy was</v>

3397
02:37:54.891 --> 02:37:59.891
<v Speaker 6>following him all around,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this guru became really well known in </v>

3398
02:37:59.891 --> 02:38:00.230
<v Speaker 6>India.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

3399
02:38:00.590 --> 02:38:05.590
<v Speaker 6>And he started bringing the white guy up</v>
<v Speaker 6>next to him on the stage when he was </v>

3400
02:38:05.590 --> 02:38:09.671
<v Speaker 6>doing his teachings and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because everybody knew him is the guru </v>

3401
02:38:09.671 --> 02:38:09.920
<v Speaker 6>that the white dude follow it all </v>
<v Speaker 6>around.</v>

3402
02:38:10.430 --> 02:38:15.430
<v Speaker 6>And eventually as the German language </v>
<v Speaker 6>skills got better in Hindi or whatever </v>

3403
02:38:15.430 --> 02:38:16.550
<v Speaker 6>language the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the guy was speaking,</v>

3404
02:38:16.940 --> 02:38:21.940
<v Speaker 6>the German realized that this was </v>
<v Speaker 6>completely full of shit and he was just </v>

3405
02:38:21.940 --> 02:38:23.180
<v Speaker 6>like using him to car.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it,</v>

3406
02:38:23.390 --> 02:38:26.090
<v Speaker 6>it was what you were saying reminded me </v>
<v Speaker 6>of it.</v>

3407
02:38:26.091 --> 02:38:30.970
<v Speaker 6>This whole idea of like what a teacher </v>
<v Speaker 6>looks like and it's A.</v>

3408
02:38:31.420 --> 02:38:33.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea is it's like the teacher,</v>

3409
02:38:33.700 --> 02:38:37.120
<v Speaker 4>the idea is you already are inside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You already awake,</v>

3410
02:38:37.450 --> 02:38:38.220
<v Speaker 4>you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3411
02:38:38.230 --> 02:38:40.300
<v Speaker 4>you're caught up in your ego,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're attached to your ego,</v>

3412
02:38:40.301 --> 02:38:42.160
<v Speaker 4>you're already awake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so different people,</v>

3413
02:38:42.610 --> 02:38:45.160
<v Speaker 4>they need excuses to wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They need,</v>

3414
02:38:45.190 --> 02:38:47.370
<v Speaker 4>they need an excuse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they need some kind of things.</v>

3415
02:38:47.371 --> 02:38:52.371
<v Speaker 4>Some people need to wear robes or some </v>
<v Speaker 4>people need some kind of intense </v>

3416
02:38:52.371 --> 02:38:53.710
<v Speaker 4>meditation practice in some stories and </v>
<v Speaker 4>Buddhism,</v>

3417
02:38:53.711 --> 02:38:57.880
<v Speaker 4>somebody sees like a drop of a water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hit a puddle and suddenly they,</v>

3418
02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:00.100
<v Speaker 4>they gained the transmission and wake </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

3419
02:39:00.340 --> 02:39:02.200
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think Chogyam Trungpa,</v>

3420
02:39:02.201 --> 02:39:05.740
<v Speaker 4>he even said this whole process of </v>
<v Speaker 4>initiation is kind of ridiculous.</v>

3421
02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:10.920
<v Speaker 4>It's really more of a thing for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more of a thing because you need </v>

3422
02:39:10.920 --> 02:39:14.341
<v Speaker 4>the excuse to be a better person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is actually not to get too far off </v>

3423
02:39:14.341 --> 02:39:18.661
<v Speaker 4>track here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is in the brothers Karamazov </v>

3424
02:39:18.661 --> 02:39:18.661
<v Speaker 4>dust.</v>

3425
02:39:18.661 --> 02:39:19.000
<v Speaker 4>They ask.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He talks about Paul,</v>

3426
02:39:19.001 --> 02:39:21.610
<v Speaker 4>who is the basically the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3427
02:39:21.650 --> 02:39:24.730
<v Speaker 4>the father of Christianity who never </v>
<v Speaker 4>even met Jesus,</v>

3428
02:39:24.731 --> 02:39:29.731
<v Speaker 4>but he was like walking down the use of </v>
<v Speaker 4>persecute Christians and his name was </v>

3429
02:39:29.731 --> 02:39:34.111
<v Speaker 4>Saul and he was walking on the road to </v>
<v Speaker 4>Damascus and Jesus appears to him and </v>

3430
02:39:34.111 --> 02:39:34.750
<v Speaker 4>says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saul,</v>

3431
02:39:34.751 --> 02:39:36.490
<v Speaker 4>Saul,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do you persecute me?</v>

3432
02:39:36.730 --> 02:39:39.080
<v Speaker 4>And at that moment he like he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he changed.</v>

3433
02:39:39.100 --> 02:39:43.980
<v Speaker 4>He realizes that Jesus is love and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes like a disciple of Christ and he</v>

3434
02:39:43.981 --> 02:39:46.860
<v Speaker 4>changes and so Dostoevsky and is </v>
<v Speaker 4>awesome.</v>

3435
02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:48.760
<v Speaker 4>I say in the brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Karamazov says,</v>

3436
02:39:48.761 --> 02:39:53.761
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened there is Jesus like a </v>

3437
02:39:53.761 --> 02:39:56.551
<v Speaker 4>magical medicine being that like touched</v>
<v Speaker 4>him and there was some magical thing </v>

3438
02:39:56.551 --> 02:39:57.550
<v Speaker 4>that went through him were suddenly got </v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

3439
02:39:57.790 --> 02:40:02.790
<v Speaker 4>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then Jesus has nothing and humans are </v>

3440
02:40:02.790 --> 02:40:03.280
<v Speaker 4>just empty robotic things and there's no</v>
<v Speaker 4>freedom.</v>

3441
02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:08.460
<v Speaker 4>All you have to do is come in contact </v>
<v Speaker 4>with the right person and you're going </v>

3442
02:40:08.460 --> 02:40:09.070
<v Speaker 4>to get better again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Freedom's gone in that equation.</v>

3443
02:40:09.250 --> 02:40:14.250
<v Speaker 4>Or did saul need an excuse to stop being</v>
<v Speaker 4>an asshole and the excuse he used was </v>

3444
02:40:15.391 --> 02:40:20.391
<v Speaker 4>this hallucination of some magical being</v>
<v Speaker 4>that came to him and he let that be the </v>

3445
02:40:20.391 --> 02:40:23.520
<v Speaker 4>excuse that let him truly become a a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

3446
02:40:23.530 --> 02:40:28.530
<v Speaker 4>an awakened being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is why in so many different </v>

3447
02:40:28.530 --> 02:40:28.530
<v Speaker 4>religions and so many different </v>
<v Speaker 4>philosophies,</v>

3448
02:40:28.530 --> 02:40:33.441
<v Speaker 4>there's the process of initiation which </v>
<v Speaker 4>is like these series of things that you </v>

3449
02:40:33.441 --> 02:40:34.270
<v Speaker 4>go through to the martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3450
02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:37.810
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts are all the.</v>

3451
02:40:37.811 --> 02:40:40.480
<v Speaker 1>All the things you're saying are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>very beautiful,</v>

3452
02:40:40.690 --> 02:40:45.690
<v Speaker 1>but they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're so clearly a work of fiction </v>

3453
02:40:45.690 --> 02:40:46.480
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so clearly pros there.</v>

3454
02:40:46.481 --> 02:40:50.500
<v Speaker 1>So clearly a story like all the even </v>
<v Speaker 1>there like flavored.</v>

3455
02:40:50.501 --> 02:40:55.501
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's truth in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's truth delivered in the filter </v>

3456
02:40:55.501 --> 02:40:59.821
<v Speaker 1>of a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know about someone getting slapped </v>

3457
02:40:59.821 --> 02:41:00.730
<v Speaker 1>in the face of the Sandal and beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightened or someone seeing water hit.</v>

3458
02:41:01.040 --> 02:41:04.400
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make it untrue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3459
02:41:04.401 --> 02:41:05.470
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely not.</v>

3460
02:41:05.500 --> 02:41:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you consider the age of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>

3461
02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:09.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The age of these initial thoughts.</v>

3462
02:41:09.311 --> 02:41:14.311
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how old are the original stories that </v>

3463
02:41:14.311 --> 02:41:14.311
<v Speaker 1>goddamn ancient knows</v>

3464
02:41:14.311 --> 02:41:18.870
<v Speaker 4>mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that the essence of fiction to </v>

3465
02:41:18.870 --> 02:41:18.870
<v Speaker 4>convey a truth?</v>

3466
02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:23.960
<v Speaker 1>I find it fascinating because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that when these things were </v>

3467
02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:27.051
<v Speaker 1>originally conveyed and put down onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>some form of written language or what </v>

3468
02:41:27.051 --> 02:41:27.080
<v Speaker 1>have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the,</v>

3469
02:41:27.100 --> 02:41:30.720
<v Speaker 1>the actual stories still resonate </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the obvious fiction,</v>

3470
02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:36.200
<v Speaker 1>actual truths of what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still resonate through the obvious </v>

3471
02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:40.131
<v Speaker 1>fiction of the work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can tell me that a guy slapped </v>

3472
02:41:40.131 --> 02:41:40.230
<v Speaker 1>a guy with a Sandal and he achieved </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment.</v>

3473
02:41:40.260 --> 02:41:41.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3474
02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:41.610
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3475
02:41:41.640 --> 02:41:46.640
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you're saying behind it that </v>

3476
02:41:46.640 --> 02:41:48.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is exposing someone to</v>

3477
02:41:48.571 --> 02:41:53.571
<v Speaker 1>these various new passive thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes a simple thing like water </v>

3478
02:41:53.571 --> 02:41:58.340
<v Speaker 1>splashing into a pond but opens up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>doors of perception in a strange way </v>

3479
02:41:58.340 --> 02:42:03.140
<v Speaker 1>that allows this sort of exponentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing understanding of your reality</v>

3480
02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:06.510
<v Speaker 1>and then it is just one event that </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes this.</v>

3481
02:42:06.511 --> 02:42:08.550
<v Speaker 1>It is really a slap in the face of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sandal,</v>

3482
02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:10.380
<v Speaker 1>but it's still obviously fiction.</v>

3483
02:42:10.430 --> 02:42:15.430
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's what we were talking about </v>

3484
02:42:15.430 --> 02:42:15.430
<v Speaker 4>before we went on air placebo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

3485
02:42:15.430 --> 02:42:19.620
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that a placebo isn't an actual </v>

3486
02:42:19.620 --> 02:42:21.830
<v Speaker 4>drug doesn't mean it's less real if its </v>
<v Speaker 4>effects are tangible.</v>

3487
02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:22.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3488
02:42:22.371 --> 02:42:25.580
<v Speaker 4>but it's such a weird fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's just placebo.</v>

3489
02:42:25.581 --> 02:42:29.390
<v Speaker 4>I think you're talking about a container</v>
<v Speaker 4>to hold a certain type of energy.</v>

3490
02:42:29.450 --> 02:42:34.450
<v Speaker 4>That's what a placebo is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Placebo triggers yourself healing </v>

3491
02:42:34.450 --> 02:42:37.910
<v Speaker 4>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was always his religion.</v>

3492
02:42:38.160 --> 02:42:43.160
<v Speaker 4>Religion gives you a structure within </v>
<v Speaker 4>which to be the decent person you </v>

3493
02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:43.160
<v Speaker 4>already were.</v>

3494
02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one of the most ultimately </v>

3495
02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:48.400
<v Speaker 1>fascinating things about human beings is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the placebo effect.</v>

3496
02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:53.230
<v Speaker 1>The idea that there's a tangible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantifiable result that comes from a </v>

3497
02:42:53.241 --> 02:42:57.200
<v Speaker 1>certain type of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whether it's positive or negative or</v>

3498
02:42:57.201 --> 02:42:58.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or stress,</v>

3499
02:42:58.311 --> 02:43:02.930
<v Speaker 1>just stress like they've shown that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that live in big cities or people</v>

3500
02:43:02.931 --> 02:43:07.931
<v Speaker 1>that have high stress jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just much more likely to have a host of </v>

3501
02:43:07.931 --> 02:43:11.891
<v Speaker 1>different things go wrong with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>body because they're just fucking red </v>

3502
02:43:11.891 --> 02:43:11.891
<v Speaker 1>line and get all the</v>

3503
02:43:12.740 --> 02:43:14.770
<v Speaker 6>stressed devastating to your immune </v>
<v Speaker 6>system.</v>

3504
02:43:14.890 --> 02:43:19.360
<v Speaker 6>I spoke at a scientific conference once,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a psycho neuro immunology.</v>

3505
02:43:19.510 --> 02:43:21.460
<v Speaker 6>Do you know about that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's essentially the,</v>

3506
02:43:21.480 --> 02:43:26.480
<v Speaker 6>the measure of how our mental state or a</v>
<v Speaker 6>psychological state affects our immune </v>

3507
02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:30.010
<v Speaker 6>response.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And one of the guys who was onstage with</v>

3508
02:43:30.011 --> 02:43:32.470
<v Speaker 6>me is Robert Ader who just died </v>
<v Speaker 6>recently.</v>

3509
02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:36.460
<v Speaker 6>He's the first person to ever </v>
<v Speaker 6>demonstrate in a laboratory that,</v>

3510
02:43:36.820 --> 02:43:37.290
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

3511
02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:41.230
<v Speaker 6>if you stress out mice,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their immune system drops.</v>

3512
02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:43.570
<v Speaker 6>It was very interesting the way he did </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

3513
02:43:43.571 --> 02:43:47.500
<v Speaker 6>He gave them a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's that artificial sweetener?</v>

3514
02:43:47.950 --> 02:43:50.410
<v Speaker 6>Aspartame before Xylitol.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>

3515
02:43:50.411 --> 02:43:53.320
<v Speaker 6>before the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm Saccharin Saccharin.</v>

3516
02:43:53.321 --> 02:43:56.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he put Saccharin in the water and let</v>

3517
02:43:56.801 --> 02:44:00.100
<v Speaker 6>them drink the Saccharin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And as soon as they drank the Saccharin,</v>

3518
02:44:00.101 --> 02:44:04.480
<v Speaker 6>he shocked them and so he paired </v>
<v Speaker 6>saccharin with an electrical shock,</v>

3519
02:44:04.481 --> 02:44:05.800
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then,</v>

3520
02:44:05.801 --> 02:44:10.801
<v Speaker 6>and every time they were shocked,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're immune response dropped because </v>

3521
02:44:10.801 --> 02:44:13.561
<v Speaker 6>they were super stressed and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the release of toxic chemicals and all </v>

3522
02:44:13.561 --> 02:44:13.561
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

3523
02:44:13.561 --> 02:44:17.580
<v Speaker 6>And then later,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so he trained them to associate those </v>

3524
02:44:17.580 --> 02:44:20.431
<v Speaker 6>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then later he only gave them </v>

3525
02:44:20.431 --> 02:44:20.860
<v Speaker 6>Saccharin and noted that they had the </v>
<v Speaker 6>same response.</v>

3526
02:44:21.210 --> 02:44:25.730
<v Speaker 6>So the immune response had been trained.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ah,</v>

3527
02:44:25.850 --> 02:44:30.850
<v Speaker 6>that is fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so hard though to keep your head </v>

3528
02:44:30.850 --> 02:44:31.960
<v Speaker 6>about you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so hard to stay calm,</v>

3529
02:44:32.020 --> 02:44:34.810
<v Speaker 6>to just be cool and chill about things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then.</v>

3530
02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:36.470
<v Speaker 6>Sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but just a.</v>

3531
02:44:37.110 --> 02:44:42.110
<v Speaker 6>The really weird thing about this is the</v>
<v Speaker 6>next generation and the third generation</v>

3532
02:44:42.341 --> 02:44:45.880
<v Speaker 6>have the same response woe without ever </v>
<v Speaker 6>having.</v>

3533
02:44:45.881 --> 02:44:46.630
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

3534
02:44:47.020 --> 02:44:48.970
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well that makes sense.</v>

3535
02:44:48.971 --> 02:44:51.670
<v Speaker 6>It's like the same thing of the reason </v>
<v Speaker 6>why we have this fear of snakes.</v>

3536
02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:54.180
<v Speaker 6>There's a genetic memory that gets </v>
<v Speaker 6>passed down,</v>

3537
02:44:54.380 --> 02:44:56.620
<v Speaker 6>but see genessee,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is where it's really interesting.</v>

3538
02:44:56.621 --> 02:45:00.520
<v Speaker 6>This is considered epigenetics because </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not actually in the DNA,</v>

3539
02:45:00.521 --> 02:45:05.521
<v Speaker 6>but it somehow the DNA gets trained by </v>
<v Speaker 6>the experience and that's passed along,</v>

3540
02:45:06.670 --> 02:45:10.890
<v Speaker 6>but it's in the DNA gets in the dammit.</v>

3541
02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:12.610
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>

3542
02:45:12.611 --> 02:45:14.980
<v Speaker 6>that's the thing about DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've got all these genes,</v>

3543
02:45:15.310 --> 02:45:18.190
<v Speaker 6>but it's not if you just have the gene </v>
<v Speaker 6>for this or that.</v>

3544
02:45:18.191 --> 02:45:23.191
<v Speaker 6>It's if that gene is triggered.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So there are triggering mechanisms that </v>

3545
02:45:23.591 --> 02:45:25.840
<v Speaker 6>are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are more easily shifted.</v>

3546
02:45:25.870 --> 02:45:28.900
<v Speaker 6>Then the genetic content itself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's,</v>

3547
02:45:28.920 --> 02:45:30.910
<v Speaker 6>it's you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like there's a gun,</v>

3548
02:45:30.911 --> 02:45:33.700
<v Speaker 6>but that doesn't mean anyone gets shot </v>
<v Speaker 6>unless somebody pulls the trigger.</v>

3549
02:45:33.701 --> 02:45:36.550
<v Speaker 6>So the genes are all potentially there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but some get triggered,</v>

3550
02:45:36.551 --> 02:45:41.551
<v Speaker 6>some don't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so what seems to happen in this new </v>

3551
02:45:41.551 --> 02:45:45.061
<v Speaker 6>field of epigenetics is there they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>noticing that the experience of an </v>

3552
02:45:45.061 --> 02:45:48.961
<v Speaker 6>organism somehow affects the expression </v>
<v Speaker 6>of genes in subsequent generations.</v>

3553
02:45:49.030 --> 02:45:52.120
<v Speaker 6>Sheldrake's morphogenetic field </v>
<v Speaker 6>addresses this because I don't know that</v>

3554
02:45:52.121 --> 02:45:54.060
<v Speaker 6>he believed that it's a genetic </v>
<v Speaker 6>transmission,</v>

3555
02:45:54.070 --> 02:45:56.590
<v Speaker 6>but he believes that when a thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>starts,</v>

3556
02:45:56.591 --> 02:46:01.591
<v Speaker 6>a new behavior or learns a new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it creates this like a shift in the </v>

3557
02:46:01.591 --> 02:46:02.930
<v Speaker 6>morphic field,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some kind of,</v>

3558
02:46:04.030 --> 02:46:08.610
<v Speaker 6>some kind of field that exists outside </v>
<v Speaker 6>of like a life and they,</v>

3559
02:46:08.760 --> 02:46:09.440
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

3560
02:46:09.680 --> 02:46:09.980
<v Speaker 6>the</v>

3561
02:46:10.180 --> 02:46:15.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being like genetically like resonates </v>

3562
02:46:15.180 --> 02:46:18.551
<v Speaker 3>with that field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when there is some behavior </v>

3563
02:46:18.551 --> 02:46:21.191
<v Speaker 3>pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets sort of imprinted or it creates </v>

3564
02:46:21.191 --> 02:46:21.191
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the term,</v>

3565
02:46:21.191 --> 02:46:25.401
<v Speaker 3>he is like a Ronnell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have some psychedelic language for </v>

3566
02:46:25.401 --> 02:46:28.361
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a path in this morphic field that </v>

3567
02:46:28.361 --> 02:46:31.480
<v Speaker 3>then every other thing like it begins to</v>
<v Speaker 3>resonate with this shift that it's in </v>

3568
02:46:31.731 --> 02:46:32.720
<v Speaker 3>some invisible.</v>

3569
02:46:33.430 --> 02:46:35.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like a raindrop going down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>window.</v>

3570
02:46:35.181 --> 02:46:37.880
<v Speaker 2>You ever see how they form a path and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then the other ones go into the.</v>

3571
02:46:38.090 --> 02:46:38.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3572
02:46:38.751 --> 02:46:39.380
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3573
02:46:39.381 --> 02:46:40.760
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly right.</v>

3574
02:46:41.050 --> 02:46:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Way To put it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3575
02:46:42.060 --> 02:46:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You brought up earlier that I was </v>

3576
02:46:47.060 --> 02:46:47.060
<v Speaker 2>skeptical sheldrick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not skeptical sheldrick.</v>

3577
02:46:47.060 --> 02:46:51.221
<v Speaker 2>I'm just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not convinced that he's right </v>

3578
02:46:51.221 --> 02:46:51.440
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just open to it,</v>

3579
02:46:51.620 --> 02:46:56.620
<v Speaker 2>but I'm skeptical of it because I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to be true and usually stuff that I </v>

3580
02:46:56.620 --> 02:46:56.620
<v Speaker 2>want to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3581
02:46:56.620 --> 02:47:01.150
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he's ever proven anything </v>

3582
02:47:01.150 --> 02:47:01.150
<v Speaker 2>to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think his.</v>

3583
02:47:01.150 --> 02:47:02.930
<v Speaker 2>His studies on dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no masters or coming home.</v>

3584
02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:07.960
<v Speaker 2>How sketchy or those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they've been replicated </v>

3585
02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:07.960
<v Speaker 2>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3586
02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:10.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the same boat as Stanley who you </v>
<v Speaker 2>met and maybe Dunkin's.</v>

3587
02:47:10.900 --> 02:47:14.120
<v Speaker 2>Ketamine is an old friend of sheldrake's</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's where you are.</v>

3588
02:47:14.121 --> 02:47:15.500
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3589
02:47:15.501 --> 02:47:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's wrong,</v>

3590
02:47:16.701 --> 02:47:19.280
<v Speaker 2>but he hasn't proven anything until he </v>
<v Speaker 2>proves it.</v>

3591
02:47:19.281 --> 02:47:20.480
<v Speaker 2>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to say,</v>

3592
02:47:20.481 --> 02:47:21.780
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't keep writing that.</v>

3593
02:47:22.050 --> 02:47:23.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't keep saying that.</v>

3594
02:47:23.421 --> 02:47:24.830
<v Speaker 2>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fascinating theory,</v>

3595
02:47:24.831 --> 02:47:28.940
<v Speaker 2>but to say that you've actually proven </v>
<v Speaker 2>in studies not so much,</v>

3596
02:47:29.090 --> 02:47:30.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that would be something like,</v>

3597
02:47:30.981 --> 02:47:33.290
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have proven weird shit man.</v>

3598
02:47:33.320 --> 02:47:36.890
<v Speaker 2>They've proven that you can teach a rat </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to get through a maze in one part of</v>

3599
02:47:36.891 --> 02:47:41.891
<v Speaker 2>the world than a rat in another part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and get through that maze </v>

3600
02:47:41.891 --> 02:47:41.891
<v Speaker 2>quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That has been proven.</v>

3601
02:47:41.891 --> 02:47:42.700
<v Speaker 2>That's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

3602
02:47:42.740 --> 02:47:43.820
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Rupert sheldrake.</v>

3603
02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:49.640
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything that's bullshit that never </v>

3604
02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:50.120
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3605
02:47:51.070 --> 02:47:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my placements for people don't </v>

3606
02:47:56.070 --> 02:47:56.070
<v Speaker 2>know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 100th monkey was a,</v>

3607
02:47:56.070 --> 02:47:56.750
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were two islands.</v>

3608
02:47:56.751 --> 02:47:58.880
<v Speaker 2>There are a bunch of monkeys on the two </v>
<v Speaker 2>islands.</v>

3609
02:47:58.881 --> 02:48:03.881
<v Speaker 2>They had no contact with each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they couldn't swim across the </v>

3610
02:48:03.881 --> 02:48:03.881
<v Speaker 2>monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't swim by the way,</v>

3611
02:48:03.881 --> 02:48:08.680
<v Speaker 2>but even if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't have swum across the gulf </v>

3612
02:48:08.680 --> 02:48:10.010
<v Speaker 2>between the two islands and tourists </v>
<v Speaker 2>started going to one island,</v>

3613
02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:15.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were both islands and they </v>

3614
02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:15.770
<v Speaker 2>throw potatoes this in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

3615
02:48:15.771 --> 02:48:20.771
<v Speaker 2>and they threw potatoes and the monkeys </v>
<v Speaker 2>on one island learn to use the seawater </v>

3616
02:48:20.810 --> 02:48:23.270
<v Speaker 2>to wipe off the dirt off the potatoes.</v>

3617
02:48:23.750 --> 02:48:28.750
<v Speaker 2>And then that trend that sort of got </v>
<v Speaker 2>transmitted through all the different </v>

3618
02:48:28.750 --> 02:48:32.501
<v Speaker 2>monkeys on the island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when the hundredth monkey learned </v>

3619
02:48:32.501 --> 02:48:34.410
<v Speaker 2>that trick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly the monkeys on the other island</v>

3620
02:48:34.411 --> 02:48:35.870
<v Speaker 2>started doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's horseshit.</v>

3621
02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:37.070
<v Speaker 2>It jumped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not true.</v>

3622
02:48:37.230 --> 02:48:39.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says it online that it's bullshit.</v>

3623
02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Actually in wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also,</v>

3624
02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:42.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3625
02:48:42.750 --> 02:48:47.750
<v Speaker 2>what they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they basically broke down was that the </v>

3626
02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:48.350
<v Speaker 2>claim was that it was an observation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these Japanese scientists,</v>

3627
02:48:48.590 --> 02:48:53.590
<v Speaker 2>one of the primary factors and spreading</v>
<v Speaker 2>this claim was that many of the authors </v>

3628
02:48:53.590 --> 02:48:53.930
<v Speaker 2>quote secondary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tertiary,</v>

3629
02:48:53.931 --> 02:48:58.931
<v Speaker 2>or post tertiary sources who have </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves misrepresented the original </v>

3630
02:48:58.931 --> 02:49:03.491
<v Speaker 2>observations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's one of those things where it </v>

3631
02:49:03.491 --> 02:49:05.681
<v Speaker 2>just becomes this app,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how many times have you ever heard </v>

3632
02:49:05.681 --> 02:49:05.681
<v Speaker 2>people say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3633
02:49:05.681 --> 02:49:06.890
<v Speaker 2>there's killer's sperm that attack other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3634
02:49:07.380 --> 02:49:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Baker and bellis research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3635
02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:11.640
<v Speaker 2>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3636
02:49:11.790 --> 02:49:14.640
<v Speaker 2>There's no proof whatsoever that sperm </v>
<v Speaker 2>does anything other than sperm stuff.</v>

3637
02:49:14.670 --> 02:49:16.250
<v Speaker 2>I never heard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Firms aren't murderers,</v>

3638
02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:20.250
<v Speaker 2>sperm attack on other people's parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There has never been proven to be true,</v>

3639
02:49:20.370 --> 02:49:23.250
<v Speaker 2>but sperm wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I saw someone on like a science show</v>

3640
02:49:23.251 --> 02:49:25.770
<v Speaker 2>the other day quoting that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that very thing.</v>

3641
02:49:25.771 --> 02:49:27.360
<v Speaker 2>And people were fascinated like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3642
02:49:27.361 --> 02:49:28.140
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3643
02:49:28.141 --> 02:49:29.040
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is,</v>

3644
02:49:29.041 --> 02:49:34.041
<v Speaker 2>there is some differentiation in semen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first spurt of ejaculate is </v>

3645
02:49:34.291 --> 02:49:38.220
<v Speaker 2>different from the middle spurt and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last bird tastes better.</v>

3646
02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:40.920
<v Speaker 2>It's true where the tank comes to fruit </v>
<v Speaker 2>toast,</v>

3647
02:49:43.230 --> 02:49:47.510
<v Speaker 2>pineapple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3648
02:49:47.511 --> 02:49:49.500
<v Speaker 2>you were talking earlier about kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>other sperm,</v>

3649
02:49:49.501 --> 02:49:50.700
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3650
02:49:51.060 --> 02:49:52.210
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

3651
02:49:52.211 --> 02:49:57.211
<v Speaker 2>it's not that there are sperm that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing other sperm that's not the </v>

3652
02:49:57.211 --> 02:50:01.651
<v Speaker 2>killer sperm thing and the kamikaze </v>
<v Speaker 2>sperm and all the baker and bellis went </v>

3653
02:50:01.651 --> 02:50:04.580
<v Speaker 2>way too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact they split at that point and the</v>

3654
02:50:04.740 --> 02:50:08.910
<v Speaker 2>one of them stopped working with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other because the one kept saying,</v>

3655
02:50:08.911 --> 02:50:11.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack sperm and all this,</v>

3656
02:50:11.490 --> 02:50:16.490
<v Speaker 2>but it's true that the first part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack Hewlett has chemicals that kill </v>

3657
02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:22.040
<v Speaker 2>preexisting sperm and the last spurt of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ejaculate has chemicals that protect</v>

3658
02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:26.130
<v Speaker 2>your sperm from the next guy's first </v>
<v Speaker 2>spurt.</v>

3659
02:50:26.700 --> 02:50:31.700
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a train,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the first car on the train attacks </v>

3660
02:50:31.700 --> 02:50:35.931
<v Speaker 2>what's already there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last car protects what you're </v>

3661
02:50:35.931 --> 02:50:35.931
<v Speaker 2>putting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3662
02:50:35.931 --> 02:50:38.890
<v Speaker 2>So he just basically extrapolated way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually interesting.</v>

3663
02:50:38.910 --> 02:50:39.900
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3664
02:50:40.060 --> 02:50:44.640
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting is actually head of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>penis design to suction out other dudes.</v>

3665
02:50:44.641 --> 02:50:49.641
<v Speaker 2>Just the plunger that the helmet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole idea of the helmet is the </v>

3666
02:50:49.720 --> 02:50:54.720
<v Speaker 2>pushrod and pulls back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the other guys just squirts in your </v>

3667
02:50:54.720 --> 02:50:58.911
<v Speaker 2>own boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give 'em hell sending your own troop.</v>

3668
02:50:59.370 --> 02:51:00.480
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

3669
02:51:00.481 --> 02:51:05.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're obviously designed for multiple </v>

3670
02:51:05.481 --> 02:51:05.481
<v Speaker 2>meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's.</v>

3671
02:51:05.481 --> 02:51:05.481
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our testicle swell.</v>

3672
02:51:05.481 --> 02:51:06.960
<v Speaker 2>When there's women around that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>having sex with more than one.</v>

3673
02:51:06.970 --> 02:51:08.880
<v Speaker 2>The fact that they're outside our </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodies,</v>

3674
02:51:08.970 --> 02:51:13.970
<v Speaker 2>right about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's about keeping them cooler than </v>

3675
02:51:13.970 --> 02:51:14.220
<v Speaker 2>body temperature so that they can be out</v>
<v Speaker 2>rubbing them,</v>

3676
02:51:14.221 --> 02:51:19.221
<v Speaker 2>sucking them a lot of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be useless if they're inside your </v>

3677
02:51:19.471 --> 02:51:19.710
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

3678
02:51:19.710 --> 02:51:24.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a Yin and Yang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You take the possibility of getting </v>

3679
02:51:24.710 --> 02:51:26.991
<v Speaker 2>kicked in the balls and you bounce it </v>
<v Speaker 2>against someone's sucking your balls </v>

3680
02:51:26.991 --> 02:51:26.991
<v Speaker 2>with a jerk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You off.</v>

3681
02:51:27.570 --> 02:51:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Gorillas have their testicles inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>their body that's also have a little one</v>

3682
02:51:31.471 --> 02:51:32.880
<v Speaker 2>inch Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little one inch sticks.</v>

3683
02:51:32.881 --> 02:51:37.881
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking silly with Ted would not let me </v>

3684
02:51:37.881 --> 02:51:37.881
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did my ted talk.</v>

3685
02:51:38.470 --> 02:51:43.470
<v Speaker 2>They pulled that I've got in my talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've given all over the place.</v>

3686
02:51:43.531 --> 02:51:48.531
<v Speaker 2>There's the sort of last moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pivot of the whole talk is this </v>

3687
02:51:49.021 --> 02:51:54.021
<v Speaker 2>slide where I've been showing charts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>testicle size and penis design and all </v>

3688
02:51:54.021 --> 02:51:58.821
<v Speaker 2>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I get to this chart and it's </v>

3689
02:51:58.821 --> 02:51:58.821
<v Speaker 2>got and the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see in the upper left hand corner,</v>

3690
02:51:58.821 --> 02:52:03.441
<v Speaker 2>it's got a gorilla lying on his back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no balls and in the upper right </v>

3691
02:52:03.441 --> 02:52:08.361
<v Speaker 2>hand corner it's got a Banaba whose </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls are like bigger than chicken eggs </v>

3692
02:52:08.361 --> 02:52:12.630
<v Speaker 2>and in the middle it's got a friend of </v>
<v Speaker 2>mine in a hammock wearing a speedo and </v>

3693
02:52:12.630 --> 02:52:17.221
<v Speaker 2>it says gorilla Bonobo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italian and my friends completely cool </v>

3694
02:52:19.331 --> 02:52:24.331
<v Speaker 2>with me using the slide and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he saw I did it in Australia and he saw </v>

3695
02:52:24.331 --> 02:52:24.810
<v Speaker 2>it online and wrote to me.</v>

3696
02:52:24.810 --> 02:52:26.290
<v Speaker 2>It was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway.</v>

3697
02:52:26.590 --> 02:52:28.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I did Ted the last rehearsal,</v>

3698
02:52:28.511 --> 02:52:31.210
<v Speaker 2>the day before I go on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

3699
02:52:31.650 --> 02:52:33.880
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one slide.</v>

3700
02:52:34.150 --> 02:52:36.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a little creepy and they've already</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen it.</v>

3701
02:52:36.221 --> 02:52:37.960
<v Speaker 2>I've already done it in three </v>
<v Speaker 2>rehearsals.</v>

3702
02:52:37.961 --> 02:52:40.690
<v Speaker 2>They saw before they even invited me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

3703
02:52:40.691 --> 02:52:41.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3704
02:52:41.591 --> 02:52:42.940
<v Speaker 2>It goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an one.</v>

3705
02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:45.790
<v Speaker 2>One of the people said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid of Italians will be offended.</v>

3706
02:52:47.350 --> 02:52:51.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying Italians have big balls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not an insult.</v>

3707
02:52:51.100 --> 02:52:56.100
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italians think they're going to be </v>

3708
02:52:56.100 --> 02:52:56.100
<v Speaker 2>offended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I said.</v>

3709
02:52:56.100 --> 02:52:56.100
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever been to New York?</v>

3710
02:52:56.260 --> 02:53:00.490
<v Speaker 2>It's weirdly probably ride noisy </v>
<v Speaker 2>motorcycles.</v>

3711
02:53:01.130 --> 02:53:06.130
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So would they have like a little skull </v>

3712
02:53:06.130 --> 02:53:06.650
<v Speaker 2>cap on handlebars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hold up like this.</v>

3713
02:53:09.810 --> 02:53:10.750
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3714
02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:13.060
<v Speaker 2>what's the connection?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get that because they have tiny</v>

3715
02:53:13.061 --> 02:53:18.061
<v Speaker 2>dicks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy loud motorcycles to compensate or </v>

3716
02:53:18.790 --> 02:53:23.790
<v Speaker 2>they're expensive red sports cars or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they work out a lot.</v>

3717
02:53:26.260 --> 02:53:28.450
<v Speaker 2>One of the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well they definitely work out a lot.</v>

3718
02:53:28.451 --> 02:53:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of gorillas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3719
02:53:30.230 --> 02:53:35.230
<v Speaker 2>like they're working out animals ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the biggest muscled ones and </v>

3720
02:53:35.230 --> 02:53:35.630
<v Speaker 2>they also have the littlest Dick's </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3721
02:53:35.640 --> 02:53:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Any incidents?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

3722
02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ted,</v>

3723
02:53:40.830 --> 02:53:45.830
<v Speaker 1>I love the Ted talks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're endlessly educational </v>

3724
02:53:45.830 --> 02:53:49.401
<v Speaker 1>and fascinating and interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's because of the vast amount of </v>

3725
02:53:49.401 --> 02:53:52.200
<v Speaker 1>interesting people that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>collected as an organization.</v>

3726
02:53:52.560 --> 02:53:54.090
<v Speaker 1>I've heard a lot of weird shit about </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3727
02:53:54.300 --> 02:53:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Your thing is one,</v>

3728
02:53:56.050 --> 02:53:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Hong was there with the same thing</v>

3729
02:53:58.791 --> 02:54:02.610
<v Speaker 2>with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>part Graham Hancock horror story,</v>

3730
02:54:02.611 --> 02:54:07.611
<v Speaker 2>so they're not infallible and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>also probably growing at a fucking </v>

3731
02:54:07.611 --> 02:54:08.900
<v Speaker 2>staggering Sarah and Sarah Silverman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Silverman and other things.</v>

3732
02:54:09.050 --> 02:54:14.050
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I did that and they made me take </v>

3733
02:54:14.050 --> 02:54:14.050
<v Speaker 2>the slide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went back room to our backstage to the</v>

3734
02:54:14.050 --> 02:54:14.950
<v Speaker 2>technical guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3735
02:54:15.020 --> 02:54:16.400
<v Speaker 2>And one of the guys looked at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

3736
02:54:16.430 --> 02:54:20.920
<v Speaker 2>you're getting Silverman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick,</v>

3737
02:54:20.960 --> 02:54:23.210
<v Speaker 2>you got Silverman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

3738
02:54:23.680 --> 02:54:26.430
