00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.440
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.840
<v Speaker 2>but the beautiful thing about boxing is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that with everything wrong in the world,</v>

3
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.020
<v Speaker 2>and I hate to use this cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this terminology,</v>

4
00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:19.190
<v Speaker 2>but you know we'd live being unfair</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't like to use that</v>

5
00:00:19.191 --> 00:00:21.920
<v Speaker 2>because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because sometimes people nowadays,</v>

6
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.920
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's too many excuses out there.</v>

7
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.320
<v Speaker 2>There really are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's too many damn excuses.</v>

8
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.560
<v Speaker 2>You in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got a chance to do some where you</v>

9
00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:35.300
<v Speaker 2>don't have in other places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but having said that,</v>

10
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.790
<v Speaker 2>he can feel like life's not fair</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes.</v>

11
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly when you think about some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things we just talked about in a day</v>

12
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 2>that's gone now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not there no more,</v>

13
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:44.660
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

14
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Dave Lewis and all those kind of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Life wasn't fair that really they really</v>

15
00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:54.470
<v Speaker 2>had a right to use that say nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people have a white black,</v>

16
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 2>purple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a right to say that to</v>

17
00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:59.720
<v Speaker 2>the extent that they did back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to the extent.</v>

18
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

19
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 2>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really lose all the things wrong or</v>

20
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:04.160
<v Speaker 2>they're messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People still out there.</v>

21
00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:05.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

22
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.841
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

23
00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:09.920
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes it's too easy to use that.</v>

24
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.270
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too easy.</v>

25
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

26
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.490
<v Speaker 2>But there was a time when life too often</v>
<v Speaker 2>was unfair.</v>

27
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.620
<v Speaker 2>Ruthlessly unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really unfair.</v>

28
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Were ruthlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

29
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

30
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.530
<v Speaker 2>And when life was unfair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boxing was around to make it fair.</v>

31
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 2>And I'll tell you how</v>
<v Speaker 2>on one given night,</v>

32
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 2>if you worked hard enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you dream big enough,</v>

33
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.840
<v Speaker 2>if you were tough enough and you made</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself tough enough,</v>

34
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.390
<v Speaker 2>you sacrificed enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became polished and savvy enough and</v>

35
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 2>and technically</v>
<v Speaker 2>equipped to do things that you had.</v>

36
00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Speaker 2>And you learn those things and you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>work yourself to the ball.</v>

37
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 2>No matter where you came from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what part of the world,</v>

38
00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:08.690
<v Speaker 2>no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who your parents were,</v>

39
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.180
<v Speaker 2>no matter what your poverty level may</v>
<v Speaker 2>have been made,</v>

40
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:13.910
<v Speaker 2>not a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what you had,</v>

41
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.980
<v Speaker 2>what you didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter what people had told you,</v>

42
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.580
<v Speaker 2>didn't tell you</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that.</v>

43
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.070
<v Speaker 2>If you made yourself and took advantage</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that opportunity and get yourself</v>

44
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:33.071
<v Speaker 2>ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you already to behave like a champion.</v>

45
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
<v Speaker 2>You could get in that ring on one given</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and make the world fair and have</v>

46
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:47.601
<v Speaker 2>your hand lifted view called champion of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world that makes box and special</v>

47
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.810
<v Speaker 1>and it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in some ways there's a leveling</v>

48
00:02:52.811 --> 00:02:57.811
<v Speaker 1>of the playing field that a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologies present to some people where</v>

49
00:02:58.661 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

50
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a freak.</v>

51
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>You're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know this.</v>

52
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>There was some silly article on fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptance the other day and it was</v>

53
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>talking and then they got some proposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fine.</v>

54
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I accept people who drink except I've</v>

55
00:03:13.521 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>accept all kinds of unhealthy choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but listen,</v>

56
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>don't lie to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just don't lie about the physical</v>

57
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>reality of what you've done to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

58
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>If you reach 400 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>

59
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 1>that's not healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're saying it's healthy.</v>

60
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 1>You're saying it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

61
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:29.890
<v Speaker 1>you're just not dead yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you lost 200 pounds,</v>

62
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>you would feel wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be healthier.</v>

63
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Like if you smoke every day and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

64
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:35.471
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

65
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking is healthy.</v>

66
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.481
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

67
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>

68
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>your body is dealing with it.</v>

69
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Your body's processing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It won't be able to forever.</v>

70
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>That is exactly what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're morbidly obese and for you to</v>

71
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:53.221
<v Speaker 1>pretend any differently and to just go</v>
<v Speaker 1>on about this fat acceptance movement</v>

72
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 1>and you know the big beautiful this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and like,</v>

73
00:03:57.281 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're obese.</v>

74
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>You've eaten too much food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you see a fat guy,</v>

75
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>how come he doesn't get the same sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment?</v>

76
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Have you see a morbidly obese man and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his underwear?</v>

77
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 1>No one's saying he's beautiful because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's disgusting and he's fat and he's</v>

78
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 1>lazy and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's addicted to food.</v>

79
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 1>We all know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it's a woman were so inclined to</v>

80
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:20.390
<v Speaker 1>like accept just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

81
00:04:20.391 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll let her go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's fine.</v>

82
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>You're wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're beautiful.</v>

83
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.850
<v Speaker 1>You're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like can give her her space.</v>

84
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:32.851
<v Speaker 1>We treat them as if they're incapable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing the absolute reality of</v>

85
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:37.900
<v Speaker 1>their physical being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how you feel about mumble</v>

86
00:04:37.901 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Speaker 1>rap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mumble rap is one of the weirdest</v>

87
00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:40.530
<v Speaker 1>things</v>

88
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.363
<v Speaker 3>to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

89
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bizarre.</v>

90
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.750
<v Speaker 3>It's bizarre what is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

91
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I feel like I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be that dude who doesn't get it right.</v>

92
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.400
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't get it.</v>

93
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't get it either I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you start dealing with youth</v>

94
00:04:57.961 --> 00:05:01.860
<v Speaker 3>culture and when I was the age of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>mumble rap kids,</v>

95
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.470
<v Speaker 3>they were older heads saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

96
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.673
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

97
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.270
<v Speaker 3>the generation before roster,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cold crush brothers to the big daddy</v>

98
00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:10.650
<v Speaker 3>kane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they probably thought what we were</v>

99
00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:12.960
<v Speaker 3>doing was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is that what's happening?</v>

100
00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:14.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe everyone's like,</v>

101
00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:16.280
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like I,</v>

102
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.720
<v Speaker 3>it's to the point with me where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

103
00:05:18.721 --> 00:05:20.490
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that even a genre of rap?</v>

104
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.350
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I almost look at it.</v>

105
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.530
<v Speaker 3>I guess I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I don't have a problem with it</v>

106
00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:28.890
<v Speaker 3>because I don't process it as anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>close to what I do.</v>

107
00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.720
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like if you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

108
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:32.220
<v Speaker 3>what are you think about Edm?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

109
00:05:32.221 --> 00:05:32.671
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

110
00:05:32.671 --> 00:05:33.650
<v Speaker 3>August.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>

111
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.600
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even look at it like I can't</v>

112
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.030
<v Speaker 3>listen to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then let him hear big daddy Kane and</v>

113
00:05:39.031 --> 00:05:39.864
<v Speaker 3>think it's the same thing.</v>

114
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.940
<v Speaker 1>Kids listening to music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

115
00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:45.660
<v Speaker 1>If you were listening to something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you enjoyed,</v>

116
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.320
<v Speaker 1>one of the things you loved was good</v>
<v Speaker 1>lyrics of course,</v>

117
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.330
<v Speaker 1>and when you can understand what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

118
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also,</v>

119
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.530
<v Speaker 3>it's just so driven by phrase driven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

120
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the and over and over and over</v>

121
00:05:58.821 --> 00:05:59.541
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

122
00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's just because these</v>
<v Speaker 3>kids are doing my alley or whatever and</v>

123
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 3>they're just in the zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it drug culture?</v>

124
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 3>Because that's happened before Tuesday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

125
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 3>one thing creates the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like chicken or the egg.</v>

126
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 3>Are these kids doing molly and make</v>
<v Speaker 3>mumble rap or they don't mumble rap and</v>

127
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:15.220
<v Speaker 3>they eat molly and it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

128
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the sixties,</v>

129
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 3>you going back to the fifties and</v>
<v Speaker 3>beatniks and that scene and jazz and</v>

130
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 3>heroin and w w what created it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

131
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 3>That miles and Coltrane make some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those records because they were on</v>

132
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 3>heroin or vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's happened historically.</v>

133
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 3>Is this just a drug driven culture?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know because I'm detached,</v>

134
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm detaching that and I,</v>

135
00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.210
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

136
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm a kid who grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

137
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 3>listening to metal and stuff like that.</v>

138
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.760
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

139
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm not at a shortage for Oleson to</v>
<v Speaker 3>slayer.</v>

140
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 3>I'll just listen to slayer before I</v>
<v Speaker 3>listened to that.</v>

141
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:51.590
<v Speaker 3>If that's my only option,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I'll listen to slayer.</v>

142
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I listened to black flag,</v>

143
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.060
<v Speaker 3>I listen to minor threat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'll do,</v>

144
00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.530
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

145
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 3>whether I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however I feel about it becomes</v>

146
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:07.751
<v Speaker 3>irrelevant when you realize that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have so much good shit out there.</v>

147
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.730
<v Speaker 3>So I don't need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like with film,</v>

148
00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:13.590
<v Speaker 3>like I'm not worried about a bad movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just watched the dope movie.</v>

149
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.790
<v Speaker 3>There's so many movies thrown them away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

150
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.860
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

151
00:07:18.861 --> 00:07:23.861
<v Speaker 3>I was just listening to thin lizzy if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I don't feel like adjusting to that,</v>

152
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's other things that we might</v>

153
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:28.570
<v Speaker 3>not get because we're not doing what we</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to do.</v>

154
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.300
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I was a bar of the clubs five</v>
<v Speaker 3>nights a week and you weren't married</v>

155
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 3>with kids and we were hammered maybe a</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge,</v>

156
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.650
<v Speaker 3>different time and place yet</v>

157
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.670
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

158
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:42.360
<v Speaker 1>I am baffled by this carnivore diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

159
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 1>And baffled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm baffled by how many people are</v>

160
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:51.750
<v Speaker 1>cleaning to it as a panacea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm baffled by whether or not it's a</v>

161
00:07:51.751 --> 00:07:56.040
<v Speaker 1>physiological effect or whether there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a placebo effect going on.</v>

162
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.820
<v Speaker 1>I have a theory please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

163
00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.730
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

164
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.090
<v Speaker 4>my theory is that it mimics some of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>benefits of fasting,</v>

165
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.810
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but allows people to persist for longer</v>

166
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:08.400
<v Speaker 4>because it's providing some nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

167
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.310
<v Speaker 4>most,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look in the scientific</v>

168
00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:13.220
<v Speaker 4>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fasting is the cure all for everything.</v>

169
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you can look at any condition and</v>

170
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:18.770
<v Speaker 4>fasting is the cure time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>water fasting.</v>

171
00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 4>So you can do it for two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>

172
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:22.520
<v Speaker 4>four weeks from his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tried that for a year.</v>

173
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:25.760
<v Speaker 4>That will be the cure for life in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>case.</v>

174
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.570
<v Speaker 4>The longest example is a year of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Waterford.</v>

175
00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.760
<v Speaker 4>So most people are not at that last,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

176
00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:36.430
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was extremely obese of energy stores</v>

177
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.200
<v Speaker 4>this fat stores.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

178
00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:41.960
<v Speaker 4>So that's one thing about that was that</v>
<v Speaker 4>he actually his skin trank to right,</v>

179
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.920
<v Speaker 4>which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

180
00:08:42.921 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 4>Which doesn't usually happen with weight</v>
<v Speaker 4>loss.</v>

181
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:47.090
<v Speaker 4>So this is just a theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have nothing to.</v>

182
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any evidence,</v>

183
00:08:48.651 --> 00:08:52.520
<v Speaker 4>but we meet as absorbed very high up in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the digestive tract.</v>

184
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 4>And so when you only eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a low residue diet and there's</v>

185
00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:00.650
<v Speaker 4>nothing leftover to irritate or inflame</v>
<v Speaker 4>the gut.</v>

186
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.570
<v Speaker 4>My theory is a lot of people who are</v>
<v Speaker 4>benefiting from this have really</v>

187
00:09:03.571 --> 00:09:07.920
<v Speaker 4>disrupted gut microbiome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alessio Fasano has argued that leaky gut</v>

188
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 4>is kind of a preconditioned for</v>
<v Speaker 4>autoimmunity and this,</v>

189
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 4>the carnivore diet is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's essentially like a gut rast or a</v>

190
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:18.450
<v Speaker 4>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I don't doubt that people are</v>

191
00:09:18.451 --> 00:09:21.430
<v Speaker 4>benefiting from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The question is what is the long term</v>

192
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:22.503
<v Speaker 4>implication?</v>

193
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I,</v>

194
00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.760
<v Speaker 5>I'm not anti Quito,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not anti Vegan.</v>

195
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 5>I'm anti bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And one of the problems we have is</v>

196
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 5>nutrition is replacing religion for a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of people.</v>

197
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.780
<v Speaker 5>So you find something that you identify</v>
<v Speaker 5>with and then people start to try to say</v>

198
00:09:40.231 --> 00:09:43.260
<v Speaker 5>because they identify with that movement</v>
<v Speaker 5>or like for example,</v>

199
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:45.690
<v Speaker 5>vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they identify with many of them,</v>

200
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.130
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>protection of animals,</v>

201
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.860
<v Speaker 5>not my job to judge their ethics and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that sort of thing,</v>

202
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.150
<v Speaker 5>but then they kind of try to backtrack</v>
<v Speaker 5>to find the science to support them as</v>

203
00:09:54.151 --> 00:09:56.670
<v Speaker 5>well and they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they pick and choose.</v>

204
00:09:56.671 --> 00:09:58.440
<v Speaker 5>And this is guilty of all groups,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not just vegans.</v>

205
00:09:58.441 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 5>This is also a lot of key digital diet</v>
<v Speaker 5>cell.</v>

206
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:03.930
<v Speaker 5>It's a carnivore diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever have you.</v>

207
00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:07.590
<v Speaker 5>If it has the word diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're zealots out there who are going</v>

208
00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:10.200
<v Speaker 5>after it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I will stick up for.</v>

209
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.170
<v Speaker 5>I've stuck up at a scientific conference</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the Ketogenic Diet.</v>

210
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.353
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were,</v>

211
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.000
<v Speaker 5>we were having a round table about</v>
<v Speaker 5>something different and somebody said,</v>

212
00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:19.700
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we know that the key to genic diet in</v>

213
00:10:19.701 --> 00:10:21.630
<v Speaker 5>prayers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exercise performance and endurance</v>

214
00:10:21.631 --> 00:10:22.351
<v Speaker 5>athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I said,</v>

215
00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:25.200
<v Speaker 5>I don't think that's necessarily true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

216
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:25.920
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

217
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty ambivalent or ambiguous as</v>

218
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:32.040
<v Speaker 5>to whether or not it does.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems to be kind of individual.</v>

219
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:33.420
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but on the whole,</v>

220
00:10:33.421 --> 00:10:35.520
<v Speaker 5>on the average,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't seem to impair exercise</v>

221
00:10:35.521 --> 00:10:37.590
<v Speaker 5>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's kind of what you like,</v>

222
00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:40.220
<v Speaker 5>but when you have people who you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

223
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.490
<v Speaker 5>like a Gary Taubes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who says,</v>

224
00:10:41.491 --> 00:10:42.810
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>calories don't matter,</v>

225
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.290
<v Speaker 5>it's all carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that sort of thing,</v>

226
00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:48.240
<v Speaker 5>or the carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>insulin model of obesity.</v>

227
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the research is you're able to do a lot</v>

228
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:54.570
<v Speaker 5>of hand waving about insulin and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

229
00:10:54.571 --> 00:10:57.240
<v Speaker 5>where you burn so much fat when you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>on a high fat diet,</v>

230
00:10:57.241 --> 00:10:59.340
<v Speaker 5>which is true by the way you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you burn a lot of fat,</v>

231
00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:01.050
<v Speaker 5>but what they don't talk about is that</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

232
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.240
<v Speaker 5>it's overall fat balance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much fat you store versus how much</v>

233
00:11:06.241 --> 00:11:07.074
<v Speaker 5>fat you burn.</v>

234
00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.900
<v Speaker 5>And when you're on a high fat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you store a lot of fat,</v>

235
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.990
<v Speaker 5>you also burn a lot of fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The overall caloric balance is what</v>

236
00:11:12.991 --> 00:11:16.740
<v Speaker 5>determines whether or not you will have</v>
<v Speaker 5>net storage or net deposition.</v>

237
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.870
<v Speaker 5>This same thing for high carb diet as</v>
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

238
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:22.650
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this idea that with high insulin it just</v>

239
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.630
<v Speaker 5>completely shuts down all fat burning</v>
<v Speaker 5>everywhere.</v>

240
00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:26.490
<v Speaker 5>That's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

241
00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:28.800
<v Speaker 5>if you have high carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you will burn less fat,</v>

242
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.230
<v Speaker 5>but you're also storing less fat as</v>
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

243
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:34.380
<v Speaker 5>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the net caloric balance is going to be</v>

244
00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:38.790
<v Speaker 5>what determines how much you store</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you don't really store</v>

245
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:40.980
<v Speaker 5>carbohydrates as fat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For most people.</v>

246
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.180
<v Speaker 5>They did a study,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a overfeeding women where they overfed</v>

247
00:11:45.181 --> 00:11:49.140
<v Speaker 5>them 50 percent above their caloric</v>
<v Speaker 5>maintenance and they found that of 282</v>

248
00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:51.630
<v Speaker 5>grams of fat that they stored during the</v>
<v Speaker 5>day and adipose.</v>

249
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.800
<v Speaker 5>Only four grams came from carbohydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two hundred and 78 came from fat.</v>
