00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.790
<v Speaker 2>The mystique of that been sort of a road by the Internet.</v>

81
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 2>Like there was a thing the other day were Charlie Sheen was a having a Twitter</v>

00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 2>beef with his ex wife and it was,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>

84
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:08.184
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous.</v>

85
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 2>But it was the,</v>

86

<v Speaker 2>It's like it is just used to be the one that guy was a big star that they would</v>

90
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:22.101
<v Speaker 2>be sort of living up on a house and the behind these crazy games,</v>

00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:24.334
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

93
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Now you're on the Internet,</v>

94
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>you're literally in two minutes.</v>

95
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.740
<v Speaker 1>People are watching your show a,</v>

96
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>you know the show you're playing in France,</v>

97
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>they're watching it in La and you just got done with the show like two minutes</v>

98
00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

100
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>and then they get to read your Twitter page and see when I was getting a kid,</v>

101
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>it would literally be this much of an event.</v>

102
00:02:45.391 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>It would last all day.</v>

103
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>I'd go buy like Robin Trowers record,</v>

109
00:02:58.171 --> 00:02:59.004
<v Speaker 1>and over.</v>

110
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Now kids download 300 songs in 20 minutes before they go to school or in their</v>

111
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>iPod or whatever.</v>

112
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.073
<v Speaker 1>It's just not,</v>

113
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not as personal as it used to be.</v>

114
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

115
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>like it's more accessible,</v>

116
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>it's more accessible.</v>

117
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:16.474
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>

118

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

119
00:03:18.411 --> 00:03:18.551
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

120
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:19.680
<v Speaker 1>as Randy was in Conrad,</v>

121
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 1>the article with,</v>

122
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>David Grill or whatever from,</v>

124
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.523
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

125
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.690
<v Speaker 1>foo fighters.</v>

126
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

127
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.160
<v Speaker 1>If we fight around in,</v>

128
00:03:26.161 --> 00:03:30.520
<v Speaker 1>in Nirvana and he makes so much sense to me because I,</v>

129
00:03:30.521 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>I went through all these things that he's talking about,</v>

130
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>which is playing with guys that don't really play that good and we're jamming in</v>

131
00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 1>the garage and pissing off of my parents and you know,</v>

132
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 1>and just going through that and improving from there and just getting better,</v>

133
00:03:44.321 --> 00:03:44.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.341
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

135
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Instead of people just thrown together with the songs written by somebody else</v>

136
00:03:50.051 --> 00:03:50.651
<v Speaker 1>and all that,</v>

137
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:51.484
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

139
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.193
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

140
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 1>some of the human element has been,</v>

141
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 1>that's my only complaint and it's not really a complaint,</v>

142
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:01.144
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

143
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

144
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I just prefer that people play music in not machines.</v>

145
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

146
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>

147
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.271
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

148
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:10.361
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

149
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 2>there's also the experience of going to the record store and looking at the</v>

150
00:04:13.451 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 2>album art and take it home.</v>

151
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:16.234
<v Speaker 2>And I love that.</v>

152
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.620
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely something missing in my driving 200 miles or</v>

153
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.790
<v Speaker 1>150 miles to do a photo shoot when I'm going to be the size of an ant on,</v>

154
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.230
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

155
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:25.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.980
<v Speaker 1>microchip.</v>

157
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

158
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.373
<v Speaker 1>But or whatever.</v>

159
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.131
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

160
00:04:29.131 --> 00:04:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

161
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.630
<v Speaker 1>it's not really complaining.</v>

162
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.520
<v Speaker 1>My whole thing is I just want to get our music to the people the best way I can.</v>

163
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.750
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

164
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.340
<v Speaker 1>if you know your way around the Internet,</v>

165
00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:38.910
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

166
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:40.140
<v Speaker 1>you can get that done.</v>

167
00:04:40.141 --> 00:04:43.820
<v Speaker 1>And we just got done up to this big monster cruise and you know,</v>

168
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.860
<v Speaker 1>30 bands on this big ship and we went and played on an island and you know,</v>

169
00:04:48.961 --> 00:04:49.890
<v Speaker 1>it was like a,</v>

170
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:51.721
<v Speaker 1>it was great,</v>

171
00:04:51.721 --> 00:04:51.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:53.310
<v Speaker 1>so I'm,</v>

173
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm not bitter or anything.</v>

175
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I know things are different.</v>

176
00:04:56.521 --> 00:04:59.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a really difficult on major labels,</v>

177
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:00.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:05:00.061 --> 00:05:02.600
<v Speaker 1>because we can go,</v>

179
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.890
<v Speaker 2>what are our next Elma,</v>

180
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.270
<v Speaker 2>your house and your computer.</v>

181
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.003
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

182
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.500
<v Speaker 2>that puts a lot of power in the artist's hands though.</v>

183
00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:14.450
<v Speaker 2>And it also puts a lot of power in their ability to promote themselves.</v>

184
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.040
<v Speaker 2>All they need is the Internet now.</v>

185
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.611
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

186
00:05:16.611 --> 00:05:19.100
<v Speaker 2>And all of those other closed off avenue was like,</v>

187
00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:23.450
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about getting on the Ed Sullivan show was everything to a guy</v>

188
00:05:23.451 --> 00:05:24.440
<v Speaker 2>like Rodney Dangerfield.</v>

189
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.970
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't get on the Ed Sullivan show.</v>

190
00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:28.490
<v Speaker 2>You were fucked today for a comic,</v>

191
00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:29.324
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>

192
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.990
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

193
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.100
<v Speaker 2>you don't need that at all.</v>

194
00:05:31.101 --> 00:05:31.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

195
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.920
<v Speaker 2>my friends who have become famous from the Internet,</v>

196
00:05:33.921 --> 00:05:36.470
<v Speaker 2>like Joey Diaz and Ari's fear and Duncan Trussell,</v>

197
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.880
<v Speaker 2>they've only had the internet.</v>

198
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.350
<v Speaker 2>The Internet is all they ever need it.</v>

199
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.600
<v Speaker 2>But all they had a neat,</v>

200
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.070
<v Speaker 2>all they needed was talent and a an an avenue.</v>

201
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.150
<v Speaker 2>In my days I needed a staple gun and the posters and sunset boulevard to get</v>

202
00:05:49.491 --> 00:05:50.420
<v Speaker 2>people to come out.</v>

203
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 2>And then they had to see the poster sided by it.</v>

204
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

205
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.350
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>

206
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.300
<v Speaker 2>what comes by?</v>

207
00:05:56.301 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 2>And they put it ours.</v>

208
00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.311
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

209
00:05:58.311 --> 00:05:58.851
<v Speaker 2>say that again.</v>

210
00:05:58.851 --> 00:05:59.910
<v Speaker 2>It goes over,</v>

211
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 2>there's the wars of posters.</v>

212
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:02.950
<v Speaker 2>It's still awards.</v>

213
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

214
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.360
<v Speaker 2>there's the Internet wars now.</v>

215
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.721
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

216
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:05.961
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

217
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely a lot of that.</v>

218
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 2>There's still a lot of fucking morons out there when it comes to that kind of</v>

219
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:10.371
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

220
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:11.120
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

221
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.601
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

222
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:14.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it's definitely a better time as far as putting the power in the hands</v>

223
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:19.931
<v Speaker 2>of the artists and these people that are the normal cabal that we're controlling</v>

224
00:06:20.121 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 2>the music industry.</v>

225
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:21.470
<v Speaker 2>They've,</v>

226
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.850
<v Speaker 2>they've lost a lot of their power,</v>

227
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:23.290
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

228
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

229
00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:24.911
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

230
00:06:24.911 --> 00:06:29.530
<v Speaker 1>the difference now is we don't need millions of dollars to,</v>

231
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.660
<v Speaker 1>to record and,</v>

232
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.970
<v Speaker 1>and all that kind of promotion.</v>

233
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's why that they're,</v>

234
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.380
<v Speaker 1>the major labels are suffering a bit.</v>

235
00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:38.831
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

236
00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:39.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

237
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.690
<v Speaker 1>where the power comes in is we're no,</v>

238
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.910
<v Speaker 1>no longer are we just getting our little points,</v>

239
00:06:48.911 --> 00:06:49.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

240
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.411
<v Speaker 1>when they're taking,</v>

241
00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:50.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

242
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.310
<v Speaker 1>we make $1 million and the record company gets,</v>

243
00:06:54.311 --> 00:06:54.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

244
00:06:54.701 --> 00:06:57.640
<v Speaker 1>900 and whatever.</v>

245
00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:58.751
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

246
00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:02.440
<v Speaker 1>they throw our crumbs enough crumbs to where we don't like go away.</v>

247
00:07:02.441 --> 00:07:03.250
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

248
00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.650
<v Speaker 1>but people don't realize that for most folks they'd done,</v>

249
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.550
<v Speaker 1>they'd have no idea.</v>

250
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Like how bad the deals were at span.</v>

251
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Hailing sale was amazingly bad.</v>

252
00:07:11.741 --> 00:07:12.031
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

253
00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:14.140
<v Speaker 1>and they even speak about it on the Internet.</v>

254
00:07:14.141 --> 00:07:17.920
<v Speaker 1>You can go on and they're sit together and they were actually interviewing each</v>

255
00:07:17.921 --> 00:07:20.020
<v Speaker 1>other about the old days.</v>

256
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:20.231
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

257
00:07:20.231 --> 00:07:21.850
<v Speaker 1>people think we're the bitching rock stars,</v>

258
00:07:21.851 --> 00:07:22.330
<v Speaker 1>but we are,</v>

259
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.620
<v Speaker 1>we were literally broke there.</v>

260
00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.900
<v Speaker 1>They said that their checks per week,</v>

261
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:31.090
<v Speaker 1>this is during the first album where $88 and 83 cents or something.</v>

262
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

263
00:07:31.361 --> 00:07:33.440
<v Speaker 1>And they were selling millions of albums.</v>

264
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.721
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

265
00:07:34.721 --> 00:07:35.770
<v Speaker 1>here's the funny part.</v>

266
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

267
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.040
<v Speaker 1>they got off this tour and,</v>

268
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.370
<v Speaker 1>and the record company says you owe is $2 million.</v>

269
00:07:42.371 --> 00:07:42.761
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

270
00:07:42.761 --> 00:07:43.121
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

271
00:07:43.121 --> 00:07:44.140
<v Speaker 1>let me get this straight.</v>

272
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.210
<v Speaker 1>So if we do 10 tours and sell 20 million records,</v>

273
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.150
<v Speaker 1>we're going to owe you $20 million.</v>

274
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:54.303
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

275
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.910
<v Speaker 1>It's just from all the loans and that,</v>

276
00:07:56.911 --> 00:07:57.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

277
00:07:57.221 --> 00:07:58.600
<v Speaker 1>the first coming out of the gate.</v>

278
00:07:58.601 --> 00:07:59.434
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

279
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:03.280
<v Speaker 1>well it's also just a corrupt system that has too much power.</v>

280
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.121
<v Speaker 1>It's corrupt.</v>

281
00:08:04.121 --> 00:08:09.010
<v Speaker 1>And you know that being the artist when you don't have your own representation</v>

282
00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:09.271
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

283
00:08:09.271 --> 00:08:10.390
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

284
00:08:10.391 --> 00:08:14.250
<v Speaker 1>you just want to do anything to break out of this club scene.</v>

285
00:08:14.251 --> 00:08:14.531
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

286
00:08:14.531 --> 00:08:18.460
<v Speaker 1>you want to be a big ban on big tours and so you,</v>

287
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:19.840
<v Speaker 1>they take bad deals.</v>

288
00:08:19.841 --> 00:08:20.171
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

289
00:08:20.171 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>

290
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.670
<v Speaker 1>a lot of bands have done that.</v>

291
00:08:21.671 --> 00:08:21.941
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

292
00:08:21.941 --> 00:08:24.880
<v Speaker 1>they've done successful with their album sales,</v>

293
00:08:24.881 --> 00:08:27.310
<v Speaker 1>but their business side of is really horrid.</v>

294
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

295
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:28.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

296
00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:32.530
<v Speaker 2>That's also the difference between a business person and an artist.</v>

297
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.890
<v Speaker 2>Like a lot of artists are impulsive and they're just not that good at things</v>

298
00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:36.401
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

299
00:08:36.401 --> 00:08:37.540
<v Speaker 2>They're not that good at business.</v>

300
00:08:37.541 --> 00:08:38.410
<v Speaker 2>And I'm one of them,</v>

301
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:39.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

302
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.580
<v Speaker 1>our deal wasn't great either and uh,</v>

303
00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.460
<v Speaker 1>but we've kind of made up for that.</v>

304
00:08:44.461 --> 00:08:46.350
<v Speaker 1>We was in our whole career,</v>

305
00:08:46.351 --> 00:08:48.060
<v Speaker 1>but at the beginning it wasn't that great,</v>

306
00:08:48.061 --> 00:08:48.460
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

307
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:48.641
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

308
00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:49.090
<v Speaker 2>it sounded,</v>

309
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:49.871
<v Speaker 2>it always starts off.</v>

310
00:08:49.871 --> 00:08:50.471
<v Speaker 2>Nobody ever says,</v>

311
00:08:50.471 --> 00:08:50.591
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

312
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:52.420
<v Speaker 2>we've got an awesome deal right out of that gate.</v>

313
00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:55.750
<v Speaker 2>And we're very fortunate to have an ethical record right now,</v>

314
00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 2>which is you talking about the fucking scoundrels that signed you,</v>

315
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:58.501
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

316
00:08:58.501 --> 00:08:58.771
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

317
00:08:58.771 --> 00:08:59.604
<v Speaker 2>that's also,</v>

318
00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Speaker 2>you think about a music company.</v>

319
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 2>How many people did they sign?</v>

320
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:02.971
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>

321
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:03.151
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

322
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:05.790
<v Speaker 2>they might sign 101 of them might become great white.</v>

323
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

324
00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:06.850
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

325
00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:11.290
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of failure involved on their end to prognostication doesn't always</v>

326
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 2>come down.</v>

327
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 2>That's what they call their write offs.</v>

328
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:14.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

329
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.061
<v Speaker 2>the write up dance,</v>

330
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:15.894
<v Speaker 2>but yeah.</v>

331
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

332
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:18.270
<v Speaker 2>But for a band that successful,</v>

333
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:18.990
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

334
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:19.381
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

335
00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:20.490
<v Speaker 2>the reality behind it.</v>

336
00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever read that piece that Courtney love wrote on the,</v>

337
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:23.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

338
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 2>the music business?</v>

339
00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 2>She wrote a pretty incredible piece about explaining the expenses and how much</v>

340
00:09:29.011 --> 00:09:33.030
<v Speaker 2>it actually costs and what an artist actually gets paid and how much the studio</v>

341
00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:33.600
<v Speaker 2>gets paid.</v>

342
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

343
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.530
<v Speaker 2>And how they go about saying how much things are worth</v>

344
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:38.991
<v Speaker 1>then read the piece.</v>

345
00:09:38.991 --> 00:09:42.020
<v Speaker 1>But I'm glad she wrote something like that because it was school,</v>

346
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.610
<v Speaker 1>the audience and you know,</v>

347
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:44.081
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

348
00:09:44.081 --> 00:09:44.490
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty,</v>

349
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:45.560
<v Speaker 2>that's not their business.</v>

350
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Pretty incredible stuff getting,</v>

351
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:47.571
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

352
00:09:47.571 --> 00:09:47.691
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

353
00:09:47.691 --> 00:09:48.560
<v Speaker 2>there's a little bit of that,</v>

354
00:09:48.561 --> 00:09:51.330
<v Speaker 2>but it's also some of their business</v>

355
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.450
<v Speaker 1>people will understand that,</v>

356
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

357
00:09:54.111 --> 00:09:56.450
<v Speaker 1>we work really hard and we're not just walking around,</v>

358
00:09:56.451 --> 00:09:56.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

359
00:09:56.861 --> 00:09:58.800
<v Speaker 1>a Zillion zillionaires are we good</v>

360
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.570
<v Speaker 2>bummed out when the whole Napster thing came along and people started</v>

361
00:10:01.571 --> 00:10:05.590
<v Speaker 2>downloading MP three s and it just almost immediately sort of took the wind out</v>

362
00:10:05.591 --> 00:10:07.270
<v Speaker 2>of the sails of a records.</v>

363
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.043
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

364
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:09.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

365
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I was bummed out even before that a little bit.</v>

366
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.300
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

367
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.151
<v Speaker 1>I know me,</v>

368
00:10:16.151 --> 00:10:20.830
<v Speaker 1>like I were talking about earlier that I'm a fan of music and I like to support</v>

369
00:10:20.831 --> 00:10:21.350
<v Speaker 1>the artist.</v>

370
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:22.660
<v Speaker 1>I go out and buy their albums.</v>

371
00:10:22.661 --> 00:10:23.041
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

372
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

373
00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.820
<v Speaker 1>I want the artwork,</v>

374
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.440
<v Speaker 1>I want to know who wrote the songs.</v>

375
00:10:26.441 --> 00:10:29.320
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to know where they recorded this album.</v>

376
00:10:29.321 --> 00:10:29.471
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

377
00:10:29.471 --> 00:10:30.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

378
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.020
<v Speaker 1>I just think that's part of it.</v>

379
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:36.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's what makes the world go round in music is to support the artists.</v>

380
00:10:36.701 --> 00:10:40.300
<v Speaker 1>So I go out and buy a Zz top CD and you know,</v>

381
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.340
<v Speaker 1>when somebody comes up and go,</v>

382
00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:42.791
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

383
00:10:42.791 --> 00:10:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I just got you to a new album.</v>

384
00:10:43.961 --> 00:10:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I copied it from my friend.</v>

386
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:47.261
<v Speaker 1>well thanks.</v>

387
00:10:47.261 --> 00:10:47.561
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

388
00:10:47.561 --> 00:10:51.130

389
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.070
<v Speaker 1>or hopefully he'll go see alive,</v>

390
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:53.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

391
00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.820
<v Speaker 1>go see a live or whatever.</v>

392
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.690
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

393
00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:56.523
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

394
00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:57.783
<v Speaker 1>I dunno man.</v>

395
00:10:59.170 --> 00:10:59.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

396
00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.613
<v Speaker 2>it is what,</v>

397
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to say that that for it is what it is,</v>

398
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.250
<v Speaker 2>but it is what it is.</v>

399
00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:04.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

400
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.420
<v Speaker 2>we were changing.</v>

401
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:06.980
<v Speaker 2>The world is changing around us.</v>

402
00:11:06.981 --> 00:11:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Technology is forcing us to change and we have to adapt.</v>

403
00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.350
<v Speaker 2>But the most important thing is you're still creating,</v>

404
00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.520
<v Speaker 2>you're still doing what you love.</v>

405
00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:14.354
<v Speaker 2>You're still doing what he's doing.</v>

406
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.440
<v Speaker 2>And then the commerce aspect of it has to morph and as to morph to accommodate</v>

407
00:11:18.441 --> 00:11:20.150
<v Speaker 2>this new environment that we live in.</v>

408
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.730
<v Speaker 2>But the environment is so beneficial in so many other ways.</v>

409
00:11:22.731 --> 00:11:23.420
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

410
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.530
<v Speaker 2>it just is what it is.</v>

411
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:24.801
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

412
00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:25.880
<v Speaker 2>It has to change.</v>

413
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.830
<v Speaker 2>There's no way you're not going to have the world change when something like the</v>

414
00:11:30.831 --> 00:11:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Internet comes along.</v>

415
00:11:31.671 --> 00:11:33.140
<v Speaker 2>So all these other way,</v>

416
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.220
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

417
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:38.020
<v Speaker 2>I think the benefits way outweigh the negatives and am I right?</v>

418
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

419
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.200
