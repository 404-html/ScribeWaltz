1
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.513
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>

3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Tony Hinchcliffe lives in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian Redman is in the house.</v>

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Dun Dun Dun done Dun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've been talking about turning</v>

5
00:00:19.211 --> 00:00:21.180
<v Speaker 2>your come off with a light switch as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

6
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like a little switch that's in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>inner leg or something like that.</v>

7
00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:29.050
<v Speaker 2>And if you want to make a baby it turns</v>
<v Speaker 2>on your income or your sperm.</v>

8
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.900
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a sperm switch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they made it look like a light</v>

9
00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:34.960
<v Speaker 2>switch instead of having it like some</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird button.</v>

10
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.760
<v Speaker 2>Put it up on the screen again please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so it's in between your legs.</v>

11
00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Like what if you're jogging this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go on and off and on and off.</v>

12
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

13
00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:45.280
<v Speaker 2>It is a light switch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

14
00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 2>This isn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dare you.</v>

15
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Why am I seeing that guy's Dick?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huge.</v>

16
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Why is he big?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He semi.</v>

17
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

18
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.340
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they're showing us is,</v>

19
00:00:57.341 --> 00:00:58.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we hear this?</v>

20
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.770
<v Speaker 2>Is it okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're here is combined with seminars</v>

21
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.100
<v Speaker 2>like India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>

22
00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:05.350
<v Speaker 2>I love this guy's accent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please start from the beginning because</v>

23
00:01:05.351 --> 00:01:07.960
<v Speaker 2>it makes it even better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He speaks in the slightly broken English</v>

24
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.350
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andy Richter,</v>

25
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.100
<v Speaker 3>during his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to begin the medical approval</v>

26
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:17.360
<v Speaker 3>procedure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human males testicles produce</v>

27
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:19.610
<v Speaker 3>millions of sperm cells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyday.</v>

28
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.420
<v Speaker 3>These cells flow through the spermatic</v>
<v Speaker 3>ducts and then combined with seminar</v>

29
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.263
<v Speaker 3>related.</v>

30
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 2>It would be so disappointed if he saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>what his technology was being used for.</v>

31
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.150
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Edison invented Dick Switches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>switches,</v>

32
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.620
<v Speaker 2>power on and off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's why is it more humorous?</v>

33
00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:43.780
<v Speaker 2>Because this gentleman has an accent</v>
<v Speaker 2>mate.</v>

34
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.320
<v Speaker 2>Why would they spend so much time making</v>
<v Speaker 2>the texture of the balls and the Deq</v>

35
00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:50.020
<v Speaker 2>that realistic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they want you to know they're</v>

36
00:01:50.021 --> 00:01:53.680
<v Speaker 2>not playing games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is insane.</v>

37
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.820
<v Speaker 2>You can feel the switch and you can flip</v>
<v Speaker 2>it back and forth.</v>

38
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.110
<v Speaker 2>That is so fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what are the odds that a girl who</v>

39
00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 2>wants a baby is not going to reach back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and click that switch right while you</v>

40
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while she's rubbing your balls and when</v>

41
00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.670
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There would be the perfect time to hit</v>

42
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:11.110
<v Speaker 2>the switch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you really wanted to make a baby,</v>

43
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.880
<v Speaker 2>like let them release the hounds and</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever there'd be comes still on the</v>

44
00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:16.601
<v Speaker 2>tube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

45
00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:18.970
<v Speaker 2>like they ended the tube like hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good question.</v>

46
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is a,</v>

47
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.023
<v Speaker 2>that's an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

48
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't it like stay inside your decal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't all come out one blast and</v>

49
00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:28.030
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it can come out in the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>blast.</v>

50
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what do I know?</v>

51
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.690
<v Speaker 2>If it's fake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's craziness.</v>

52
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand if you got an</v>

53
00:02:33.371 --> 00:02:35.110
<v Speaker 2>operation to get all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it in,</v>

54
00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:37.030
<v Speaker 2>just get a vasectomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make a decision.</v>

55
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 2>Stand by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

56
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 2>It seems like in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

57
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.410
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

58
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.130
<v Speaker 2>these type of things are becoming more</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more attractive to us.</v>

59
00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Like an instant solution to like</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that we got going wrong.</v>

60
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to come up with a new</v>

61
00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:51.490
<v Speaker 2>retinas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These retinas,</v>

62
00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:53.580
<v Speaker 2>they're artificial retinas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put them in your eyes and you could</v>

63
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.570
<v Speaker 2>see 2100 or 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

64
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

65
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.520
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not good.</v>

66
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 2>Like 2100 and be terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

67
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>45,</v>

68
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.020
<v Speaker 2>20 slash 20 is normal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

69
00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.091
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>40,</v>

70
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

71
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:06.140
<v Speaker 2>that's worse too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

72
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's twice.</v>

73
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

74
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's always been like low</v>

75
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 2>numbers are really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like pilots would say I have 20 slash 15</v>

76
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 2>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See an eagle attack assignment from a</v>

77
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.180
<v Speaker 2>mile away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know like people were always like</v>

78
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 2>super proud of their vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really good vision.</v>

79
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Like whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

80
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 2>You see clearly so lower would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

81
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Like four slash 20 would be the best for</v>
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>

82
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 2>No it's too high on one side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's perfect on one side.</v>

83
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 2>Write 20th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 slash 20 slash 20.</v>

84
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck does that even stand for?</v>

85
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we should know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you see at 20 feet,</v>

86
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 2>the first 20 is what normal person sees</v>
<v Speaker 2>at 20 feet and then what you see at 20</v>

87
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 2>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see if you have 2100,</v>

88
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 2>you see what a normal person sees at 200</v>
<v Speaker 2>feet or 20 feet because your vision</v>

89
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 2>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

90
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:53.470
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

91
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.500
<v Speaker 2>That actually totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to drag.</v>

92
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

93
00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:00.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have good,</v>

94
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.550
<v Speaker 2>perfect vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Tony,</v>

95
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.790
<v Speaker 2>my vision is unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

96
00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I can read anything from like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like insane.</v>

97
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.360
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fun.</v>

98
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.400
<v Speaker 2>Have you always had that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He should probably be really good at</v>

99
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 2>something like darts or something like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

100
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

101
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 2>I would think that something along those</v>
<v Speaker 2>lines where you.</v>

102
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like super precise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you're throwing up,</v>

103
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't play darts,</v>

104
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 2>but I would imagine that it's probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty fun with all that pressure to get</v>

105
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 2>a bowl side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems kind of silly.</v>

106
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 2>He's throwing a metal stick at a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those dudes seem to be having a good</v>

107
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a hell of a shot.</v>

108
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Is a natural with a dartboard with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with an actual gun,</v>

109
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 2>with like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

110
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:46.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just shot,</v>

111
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.850
<v Speaker 2>like discuss one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

112
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 2>What do they come?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pigeons.</v>

113
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Pigeons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clay pigeon.</v>

114
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 2>And I was like 13 or 14 and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>clipping him and I remember this group</v>

115
00:04:56.021 --> 00:05:01.021
<v Speaker 2>of old guys were standing behind my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom's boyfriend that took me just like,</v>

116
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrible with the shotgun.</v>

117
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 2>I did Bert Kreischer show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had one of those clay shoot off</v>

118
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit like one.</v>

119
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 2>How do you get good at a shotgun now you</v>
<v Speaker 2>just practice.</v>

120
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.350
<v Speaker 2>You just have to understand how you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>orientating the um,</v>

121
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.800
<v Speaker 2>the site on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little more tricky than like a</v>

122
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:25.801
<v Speaker 2>hunting rifle or the site is magnified</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a shotgun for the most part,</v>

123
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 2>unless it has a scope on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the times they don't,</v>

124
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.850
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're using the barrel of the gun to</v>

125
00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:32.890
<v Speaker 2>line up where the bullets are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

126
00:05:32.891 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 2>But any variation upward down by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightest amount results in a big</v>

127
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 2>deviation of the intended path of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>weapon.</v>

128
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.140
<v Speaker 2>So like if you're trying to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 2>straight and your,</v>

129
00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:44.220
<v Speaker 2>your thing is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

130
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 2>lets kind of add them but not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll go over his head.</v>

131
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.950
<v Speaker 2>So you have to line up this little thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the front which is like a little</v>

132
00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:55.730
<v Speaker 2>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a nub and,</v>

133
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 2>and then the thing in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing in the back is</v>

134
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 4>the you and you're looking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to align the two of them</v>

135
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's like this little v and you're</v>

136
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 4>trying to put this pin in between the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Little v and hold it there as you</v>

137
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:08.400
<v Speaker 4>squeeze the trigger and don't flinch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>

138
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot involved in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes practice.</v>

139
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 4>But once you get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like anything else like archery or</v>

140
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 4>bowling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

141
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 4>once you understand the technique behind</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

142
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 4>then it's just a matter of drilling it</v>
<v Speaker 4>over and over again.</v>

143
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 4>Like you ever seen a really good bowler?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Ari's friend Tommy.</v>

144
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.980
<v Speaker 4>What is that guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tommy Tolo.</v>

145
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.210
<v Speaker 4>And whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is this?</v>

146
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.220
<v Speaker 4>He gave me a damage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He gave me a uh,</v>

147
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.460
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I already,</v>

148
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.440
<v Speaker 4>you'll find it right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

149
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gave me a really good dude.</v>

150
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 4>Whoever that guy is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ballerina,</v>

151
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

152
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.450
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

153
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.260
<v Speaker 4>Tommy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>

154
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.640
<v Speaker 4>We'll figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let him figure it out.</v>

155
00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:41.474
<v Speaker 4>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll,</v>

156
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.950
<v Speaker 4>we'll talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

157
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Speaker 4>if he taught you how to bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you watch him bowl,</v>

158
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 4>like those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they throw like that curve ball where it</v>

159
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:52.590
<v Speaker 4>comes spinning and it smashes into</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>

160
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.050
<v Speaker 4>like had an angle and they can do it</v>
<v Speaker 4>consistently over and over and over and</v>

161
00:06:57.051 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 4>over again until the point where they'll</v>
<v Speaker 4>bowl like pretty close to perfect games</v>

162
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:05.450
<v Speaker 4>a lot where they'll get like real close</v>
<v Speaker 4>to making eight,</v>

163
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:06.950
<v Speaker 4>nine strikes in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>

164
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.540
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When a guy like you were,</v>

165
00:07:09.541 --> 00:07:11.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how you boil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bullet shit,</v>

166
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.290
<v Speaker 4>I just shut that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally dilutes.</v>

167
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.700
<v Speaker 4>Tommy dilutes great guy by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Super fucking Nice Guy.</v>

168
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.660
<v Speaker 4>He's hung out with us a couple of times</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's a pro bowler.</v>

169
00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.930
<v Speaker 4>So if that guy taught you how to bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he could teach you the technique,</v>

170
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 4>then it would just be a matter of you</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanting to keep working at it.</v>

171
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.520
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's archery or that's darts or</v>

172
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:35.354
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

173
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.970
<v Speaker 4>it's just a matter of someone showing</v>
<v Speaker 4>you how to do it.</v>

174
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 4>You figured it out what's best for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then numbers.</v>

175
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 4>That's what that's why people don't like</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get good at shit.</v>

176
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:48.080
<v Speaker 4>The numbers involved or nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to be a professional golfer,</v>

177
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.600
<v Speaker 4>do you know what kind of numbers you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to put in?</v>

178
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.760
<v Speaker 4>Good Lord all the practice and all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking knock and then he like,</v>

179
00:07:55.761 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this isn't gonna work out.</v>

180
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.540
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you say it's not gonna work out,</v>

181
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:02.300
<v Speaker 4>but I guess it's not going to work out</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it fucking worked out for tiger</v>

182
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 4>woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking worked out for Jack Nicholas.</v>

183
00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 4>How come it fucking worked out for them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they got nutty because someone</v>

184
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.750
<v Speaker 4>taught them the technique.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They started to compete and then they</v>

185
00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:12.820
<v Speaker 4>got nutty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

186
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.360
<v Speaker 4>You just got to decide whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to get nutty and getting that.</v>

187
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.870
<v Speaker 4>He's not the best idea in the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>

188
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.810
<v Speaker 4>A lot of those guys want to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>hitting the rocks.</v>

189
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.020
<v Speaker 4>They never stopped at the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just fucking keep that cast going.</v>

190
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.740
<v Speaker 4>It's like stand up in a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

191
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.820
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything that represents you,</v>

192
00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you focus on it and the more you focus</v>

193
00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:38.420
<v Speaker 4>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the better it gets at it and if you</v>

194
00:08:38.421 --> 00:08:40.040
<v Speaker 4>don't focus on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't get better.</v>

195
00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:41.240
<v Speaker 4>And if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>

196
00:08:41.241 --> 00:08:44.210
<v Speaker 4>And it's a matter of how much do you</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to focus on where you can enjoy the</v>

197
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:45.430
<v Speaker 4>rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

198
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.150
<v Speaker 4>what percentage of your life does it</v>
<v Speaker 4>become?</v>

199
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 4>It always amazes me that people that get</v>
<v Speaker 4>like so great at video games.</v>

200
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.030
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you never.</v>

201
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.960

<v Speaker 4>The dude who was the old</v>

202

<v Speaker 2>manager at the comedy store.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Was He booking talent?</v>

205
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he was doing that for</v>
<v Speaker 2>awhile.</v>

206
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he was doing that for awhile</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>

207
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 2>Really good magic.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was addicted to that.</v>

209
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 2>He was addicted to Everquest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe at first.</v>

210
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The magic.</v>

211
00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:18.030
<v Speaker 2>The gathering is a card game though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

212
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 2>It's also a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's video again to.</v>

213
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure he was a everquest</v>
<v Speaker 2>junkie.</v>

214
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Bad Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like bad.</v>

215
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.870
<v Speaker 2>And he would come to the comedy store</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'd be depressed,</v>

216
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.860
<v Speaker 2>like he would get out of his house when</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could and when he could,</v>

217
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.470
<v Speaker 2>he would come out and hang out with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with us in the real world.</v>

218
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.940
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were in the back bar and it was just</v>

<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was tired and he looked pale.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

232
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.620
<v Speaker 2>you make money in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you may collect gold coins.</v>

233
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:19.530
<v Speaker 2>He combined magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Said I worked by saying that,</v>

234
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:19.951
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

235
00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:20.500
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

236
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.700
<v Speaker 2>You level up the more he played,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was like king of kings,</v>

237
00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had like a crazy player and</v>

238
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:26.680
<v Speaker 2>everything like king of King.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

239
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.010
<v Speaker 2>when you get really good right in</v>
<v Speaker 2>everquest,</v>

240
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 2>like the higher you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you can fuck people up.</v>

241
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:32.770
<v Speaker 2>He could do whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

242
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.460
<v Speaker 2>You just become like invincible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

243
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.870
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're on that shit 24 hours a day</v>

244
00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:38.580
<v Speaker 2>for 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one fuck with you.</v>

245
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.670
<v Speaker 2>They just can't fuck with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that how world of warcraft death?</v>

246
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.050
<v Speaker 2>They're encouraging addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so obvious.</v>

247
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:47.830
<v Speaker 2>It's so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're there.</v>

248
00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.970
<v Speaker 2>They're very clever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is a money vampire.</v>

249
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:55.130
<v Speaker 2>I figured out a really entertaining</v>
<v Speaker 2>money vampire just sucks it out of</v>

250
00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 2>south park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did one on it and it's just like</v>

251
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.350
<v Speaker 2>unbelievably hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what's interesting?</v>

252
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:06.360
<v Speaker 2>The concept that you can get better at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it the more time you put in it because</v>

253
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:09.540
<v Speaker 2>you get more stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a really weird concept</v>

254
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:13.650
<v Speaker 2>because that's not how it is in any</v>
<v Speaker 2>other game and in any other game.</v>

255
00:11:13.651 --> 00:11:15.780
<v Speaker 2>What's cool about playing quake?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

256
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.990
<v Speaker 2>I hate to harp on quick all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I used to love playing it,</v>

257
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that you both start out like she,</v>

258
00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.370
<v Speaker 2>you guys were going to have a death</v>
<v Speaker 2>match.</v>

259
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:26.430
<v Speaker 2>He was both start out with 150 life</v>
<v Speaker 2>points,</v>

260
00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.460
<v Speaker 2>the same amount of access to weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

261
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:32.940
<v Speaker 2>you have like a little pistol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have a little blaster and then</v>

262
00:11:32.941 --> 00:11:35.220
<v Speaker 2>you run around the map to try to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the other weapons are.</v>

263
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.800
<v Speaker 2>So you have to know the map,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to know where the weapons are</v>

264
00:11:37.801 --> 00:11:41.940
<v Speaker 2>and when they spawn because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they spawn in increments like every 15,</v>

265
00:11:41.941 --> 00:11:43.590
<v Speaker 2>20 seconds or something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it is,</v>

266
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.620
<v Speaker 2>maybe a minute for some weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe some weapons spun differently.</v>

267
00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:51.621
<v Speaker 2>So these guys had programs in their code</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it would alert them when,</v>

268
00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rocket launcher was about spawn.</v>

269
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Speaker 2>So they had it timed into their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their code.</v>

270
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.510
<v Speaker 2>So they would receive little messages up</v>
<v Speaker 2>on their screen that would let them know</v>

271
00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 2>that rocket launchers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're about to spawn.</v>

272
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Speaker 2>So they'd run to get to the rocket</v>
<v Speaker 2>launch because he who gets a rocket</v>

273
00:12:06.551 --> 00:12:10.750
<v Speaker 2>launcher first most likely wins a death</v>
<v Speaker 2>match because these guys know the maps</v>

274
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:12.380
<v Speaker 2>and they start blasting each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then they,</v>

275
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:14.840
<v Speaker 2>everybody starts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even everybody starts even it's.</v>

276
00:12:14.841 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 2>So that's what's exciting about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a mad scramble if you got to a</v>

277
00:12:17.741 --> 00:12:22.741
<v Speaker 2>point where you could just fog people up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and turn their cities into dust and</v>

278
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:26.440
<v Speaker 2>bring down fire and brimstone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's too much.</v>

279
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.570
<v Speaker 2>And we get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's got to be even more your</v>

280
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.900
<v Speaker 2>games bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just got a giant addiction thing.</v>

281
00:12:31.901 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got an addiction pyramid scheme</v>

282
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:35.020
<v Speaker 2>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

283
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.870
<v Speaker 2>And you're talking to yourself in third</v>
<v Speaker 2>person as if it wasn't you that did all</v>

284
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:38.723
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

285
00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Well sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm thinking about Robert because</v>

286
00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:47.971
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about the game of everquest</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is way more addictive element,</v>

287
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:54.850
<v Speaker 2>like the element of the long you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more power you have and the more you</v>

288
00:12:54.851 --> 00:12:57.430
<v Speaker 2>can accomplish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more dragons you can slay and what</v>

289
00:12:57.431 --> 00:13:00.920
<v Speaker 2>have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I was into was a these crazy</v>

290
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.840
<v Speaker 2>one-on-one death matches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were so fun and I,</v>

291
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.440
<v Speaker 2>I was never good at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

292
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.070
<v Speaker 2>I used to get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it wasn't a matter of like me being</v>

293
00:13:09.071 --> 00:13:11.260
<v Speaker 2>successful at quake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the opposite.</v>

294
00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Like I could never catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be able to beat dudes who were</v>

295
00:13:15.281 --> 00:13:19.510
<v Speaker 2>clueless if some dude was clueless and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got into one of those maps with me,</v>

296
00:13:19.511 --> 00:13:21.910
<v Speaker 2>I could fuck them up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of the time I got fucked up.</v>

297
00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:26.020
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time you're getting fucked</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with these young kids were so good.</v>

298
00:13:26.021 --> 00:13:28.140
<v Speaker 2>They're fucking hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eye Coordination is like,</v>

299
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:32.740
<v Speaker 2>it's designed through the game because</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they were a bit hesitant were</v>

300
00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:35.470
<v Speaker 2>children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're using a mouse and keyboard as</v>

301
00:13:35.471 --> 00:13:39.730
<v Speaker 2>their little brains were forming</v>
<v Speaker 2>connections with their fingertips.</v>

302
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.340
<v Speaker 2>A lot of what it involved moving a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouse.</v>

303
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.270
<v Speaker 5>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

304
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.091
<v Speaker 5>Does he?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

305
00:13:45.091 --> 00:13:48.890
<v Speaker 5>He's like on one of those like halo or</v>
<v Speaker 5>something like that.</v>

306
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:50.900
<v Speaker 5>What's one of those popular one?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Halos.</v>

307
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.880
<v Speaker 5>Popular Halo is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it might be,</v>

308
00:13:53.881 --> 00:13:55.210
<v Speaker 5>but he plays.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's A.</v>

309
00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.530
<v Speaker 5>I always think that that's like so crazy</v>
<v Speaker 5>to think that Obama is.</v>

310
00:13:58.531 --> 00:14:02.070
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it's just chill and just</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting a lit up by like some seven year</v>

311
00:14:02.071 --> 00:14:04.020
<v Speaker 5>old kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

312
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Obama please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Titanfall tight xbox one.</v>

313
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.030
<v Speaker 2>It's similar to call of duty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

314
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:15.730
<v Speaker 2>So is it a war game?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're like running around and you</v>

315
00:14:15.731 --> 00:14:20.320
<v Speaker 2>can jump in a big machines Mac or in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>game like transformers,</v>

316
00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.120
<v Speaker 2>robotech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

317
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.670

318
00:14:24.671 --> 00:14:27.400

<v Speaker 2>Isn't that amazing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hides his accident so.</v>

322
00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always weird.</v>

323
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:40.540
<v Speaker 2>One of those guys talks in a regular</v>
<v Speaker 2>accent.</v>

324
00:14:40.541 --> 00:14:41.510
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like did you ever watch homeland?</v>

327
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.410
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy named brody who's in</v>
<v Speaker 2>homeland and he plays the dude who was</v>

328
00:14:47.411 --> 00:14:50.860
<v Speaker 2>kidnapped and tortured by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorists.</v>

329
00:14:50.861 --> 00:14:52.330
<v Speaker 2>Then comes back to America and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

330
00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.720
<v Speaker 2>kind of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

331
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.690
<v Speaker 2>he's like acting as a pawn for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorist is like,</v>

332
00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.930
<v Speaker 2>it's very far fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he sounds like a,</v>

333
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.710
<v Speaker 2>like a regular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a southern American,</v>

334
00:15:03.711 --> 00:15:07.040
<v Speaker 2>like a Texan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a slight Texas accent on the show.</v>

335
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.000
<v Speaker 2>And then in real life he talks with like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this crazy English accent and you hear</v>

336
00:15:11.001 --> 00:15:13.100
<v Speaker 2>him talk and you can't believe it's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this guy named Ben Mendelsohn</v>

346
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:48.190
<v Speaker 5>who is a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's one of those guys that's just so</v>

347
00:15:48.191 --> 00:15:51.190
<v Speaker 5>compelling to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like his face is always moving.</v>

348
00:15:51.191 --> 00:15:56.191
<v Speaker 5>He plays like a bad guy in everything</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I watched like six or seven of his</v>

349
00:15:57.461 --> 00:15:59.950
<v Speaker 5>movies going back and they're all</v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing.</v>

350
00:15:59.951 --> 00:16:03.340
<v Speaker 5>It's one of these like real actors and</v>
<v Speaker 5>then I found out that he's just</v>

351
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:07.810
<v Speaker 5>Australian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but complete Australian dude,</v>

352
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.490
<v Speaker 5>total Australian accent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was my favorite American actor up</v>

353
00:16:12.491 --> 00:16:14.110
<v Speaker 5>until I found out he's from Australia.</v>

354
00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.460
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of killer actors from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

355
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.530
<v Speaker 2>Russell Crowe's from Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

356
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:19.463
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

357
00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.910

359
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.980

<v Speaker 2>Mel Gibson.</v>

360
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.490
<v Speaker 2>Australian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

361
00:16:27.491 --> 00:16:29.310
<v Speaker 2>How many of those guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's Tom Hardy?</v>

362
00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:31.020
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>English.</v>

363
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Tom Hardy's a bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

364
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.880
<v Speaker 2>Just so many of them from over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>

365
00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:40.030
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes I don't even realize I was</v>
<v Speaker 5>watching a Tom Hardy movie until the end</v>

366
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.710
<v Speaker 5>of the movie and his name comes up and</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

367
00:16:41.711 --> 00:16:43.630
<v Speaker 5>who was Tom Hart?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

368
00:16:43.631 --> 00:16:45.310
<v Speaker 5>He was the main character the whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

369
00:16:45.311 --> 00:16:47.260
<v Speaker 5>Like he has some.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's another one.</v>

370
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.760
<v Speaker 5>One of the only other guides.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's funny,</v>

371
00:16:48.761 --> 00:16:52.060
<v Speaker 5>bring him up because he's another one</v>
<v Speaker 5>where I literally will look up their</v>

372
00:16:52.061 --> 00:16:54.850
<v Speaker 5>name in Vr because you can.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some of these guys,</v>

373
00:16:54.851 --> 00:16:59.110
<v Speaker 5>you can actually read the scripts and</v>
<v Speaker 5>pick the things that they want to do.</v>

374
00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can at this point,</v>

375
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

376
00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:01.761
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

377
00:17:01.761 --> 00:17:05.030
<v Speaker 2>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy can act his ass off.</v>

378
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.500
<v Speaker 5>It's sometimes he's like a ripped</v>
<v Speaker 5>monster,</v>

379
00:17:07.501 --> 00:17:11.070
<v Speaker 5>like in Mad Max and then sometimes he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>built like me in these movies and it's</v>

380
00:17:11.071 --> 00:17:13.130
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the hell like he,</v>

381
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.740
<v Speaker 5>he's one of those guys that cuts weight</v>
<v Speaker 5>and puts it on and really gets into</v>

382
00:17:16.741 --> 00:17:18.060
<v Speaker 5>character.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He plays a,</v>

383
00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:20.310
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember the name of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but one of these things,</v>

384
00:17:20.311 --> 00:17:22.020
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a twin,</v>

385
00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.110
<v Speaker 5>so he's playing the two lead characters</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he's,</v>

386
00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.290
<v Speaker 5>it's him and his twin the entire time</v>

387
00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:28.101
<v Speaker 2>playing the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

388
00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:30.580
<v Speaker 2>the Kray brothers right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that movie?</v>

389
00:17:30.581 --> 00:17:35.581
<v Speaker 2>The craze that was out a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was basically on the same brothers,</v>

390
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.800
<v Speaker 2>two brothers who were into organized</v>
<v Speaker 2>crime in England.</v>

391
00:17:38.801 --> 00:17:41.080
<v Speaker 2>They're legendary and he's playing both</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them.</v>

392
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.940
<v Speaker 2>The last time they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they had two actual twins in the</v>

393
00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:48.970
<v Speaker 2>last version of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is probably they had to,</v>

394
00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 2>for whatever actors they could get that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're twins.</v>

395
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.440
<v Speaker 5>Tom Hardy's one of these guys that I</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't even know about until my</v>

396
00:17:55.441 --> 00:18:00.120
<v Speaker 5>girlfriend who's like a huge movie buff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kept showing me movies like,</v>

397
00:18:00.121 --> 00:18:02.340
<v Speaker 5>and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she would always talk about like how hot</v>

398
00:18:02.341 --> 00:18:04.080
<v Speaker 5>he is and this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and she's just like,</v>

399
00:18:04.081 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 5>this guy's fucking amazing and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're just making me watch these Tom</v>

400
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.420
<v Speaker 5>Hardy movies because you have a crush on</v>
<v Speaker 5>him.</v>

401
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.690
<v Speaker 5>And sure enough,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this fucker won me over like big time.</v>

402
00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:13.860
<v Speaker 5>That's really no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's good.</v>

403
00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:14.700
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So where you're like,</v>

404
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.230
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

405
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.820
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking great man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck it.</v>

406
00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:18.060
<v Speaker 5>Fuck</v>

407
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:23.060
<v Speaker 2>my girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many guys do you think have ever</v>

408
00:18:23.761 --> 00:18:26.640
<v Speaker 2>played themselves in a movie like side</v>
<v Speaker 2>by side?</v>

409
00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Like twins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

410
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:29.780
<v Speaker 2>So you're playing like,</v>

411
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.330
<v Speaker 5>what I want to know is does he get paid</v>
<v Speaker 5>double for that?</v>

412
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:36.170
<v Speaker 2>Is that all done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That only seems fair,</v>

413
00:18:36.171 --> 00:18:36.711
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

414
00:18:36.711 --> 00:18:39.230
<v Speaker 2>he's got to be getting a shitload of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money for this because that's half of</v>

415
00:18:39.231 --> 00:18:41.810
<v Speaker 2>the movie is seeing if they can pull</v>
<v Speaker 2>that off.</v>

416
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.130
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you're dealing with</v>

417
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:46.570
<v Speaker 6>Agi.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're combining somehow or another.</v>

418
00:18:46.571 --> 00:18:49.380
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how they're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would imagine what they can do now,</v>

419
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:54.430
<v Speaker 6>this is just my guess is that you can</v>
<v Speaker 6>get a guy like you and you and Brian</v>

420
00:18:55.241 --> 00:18:59.140
<v Speaker 6>could have like a tussle and as long as</v>
<v Speaker 6>you wear the same size,</v>

421
00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.980
<v Speaker 6>you could superimpose his features on</v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

422
00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.110
<v Speaker 6>There's a way they could do that with</v>
<v Speaker 6>CGI.</v>

423
00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.360
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's interesting is that if the camera</v>

424
00:19:07.361 --> 00:19:11.470
<v Speaker 5>was locked off than up until,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure this movie,</v>

425
00:19:11.471 --> 00:19:13.390
<v Speaker 5>it's not locked off on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that mean?</v>

426
00:19:13.391 --> 00:19:18.391
<v Speaker 5>Locked off completely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not moving stabilized then it was always</v>

427
00:19:19.811 --> 00:19:21.820
<v Speaker 5>easier to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

428
00:19:21.821 --> 00:19:23.710
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the CGI type of things where you can put</v>

429
00:19:23.711 --> 00:19:27.550
<v Speaker 5>somebody into things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but this is like a real movie with real</v>

430
00:19:27.551 --> 00:19:28.380
<v Speaker 5>dialogue.</v>

431
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.150
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they're doing it all with</v>

432
00:19:30.151 --> 00:19:31.170
<v Speaker 6>computers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

433
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.981
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>

434
00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:35.190
<v Speaker 6>I think that if.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But he's got to act both sides of it.</v>

435
00:19:35.191 --> 00:19:37.050
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he's got to somehow or another act</v>

436
00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:39.690
<v Speaker 6>both sides of it and he has to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

437
00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:42.360
<v Speaker 6>I'm only assuming he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's physically in contact with someone.</v>

438
00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:46.200
<v Speaker 6>They would have to somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 6>get him to act out those scenes and</v>

439
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:48.860
<v Speaker 6>replace his face on the other person's</v>
<v Speaker 6>body or something.</v>

440
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:49.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just did like,</v>

441
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.990
<v Speaker 2>if they're doing a tussle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just doing the thing where like,</v>

442
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the back of the head and then</v>

443
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:54.800
<v Speaker 2>they just flip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

444
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.640
<v Speaker 2>when they're wrong around where it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a smaller,</v>

445
00:19:56.641 --> 00:19:58.860
<v Speaker 2>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creepy version of them that I did it</v>

446
00:19:58.861 --> 00:20:01.650
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Pepsi Spice Commercial where I just</v>

447
00:20:01.651 --> 00:20:05.190
<v Speaker 2>pretty much recorded the same two things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then just split right down the</v>

448
00:20:05.191 --> 00:20:05.911
<v Speaker 2>middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

449
00:20:05.911 --> 00:20:09.120
<v Speaker 2>I forgot about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was like 15 years ago I did this.</v>

450
00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are hilarious myself.</v>

451
00:20:11.431 --> 00:20:14.210
<v Speaker 2>This looks exactly like the commercial</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

452
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.430
<v Speaker 2>Tom was talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is hilarious.</v>

453
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.440
<v Speaker 2>I forgot about that this morning and it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

454
00:20:19.441 --> 00:20:22.110
<v Speaker 2>I even put that in the Coffee Cup and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I grabbed the coffee cup.</v>

455
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.880
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

456
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.390
<v Speaker 2>That's actually cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

457
00:20:27.391 --> 00:20:29.430
<v Speaker 2>That was one of your finest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>finest hours.</v>

458
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.190
<v Speaker 2>The Pepsi Spice Days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I did that on paintbrush,</v>

459
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:38.520
<v Speaker 2>but what would you do if you had to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a confrontation?</v>

460
00:20:38.521 --> 00:20:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Does he have a confrontation with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>brother?</v>

461
00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming he does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

462
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.620
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing that I would think</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the issue.</v>

463
00:20:45.621 --> 00:20:47.890
<v Speaker 2>It was like you fighting with you</v>

464
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.370
<v Speaker 7>because that'd be really hard to mesh</v>
<v Speaker 7>together,</v>

465
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.150
<v Speaker 7>but otherwise if it's just you in a</v>
<v Speaker 7>separate scene,</v>

466
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.990
<v Speaker 7>are you in a scene with two of you?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is You just have to do the scene twice?</v>

467
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:00.640
<v Speaker 7>It's still.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They have to combine it.</v>

468
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:05.930
<v Speaker 7>If you have to do one and then probably</v>
<v Speaker 7>they play back your thing when you're</v>

469
00:21:07.121 --> 00:21:09.030
<v Speaker 7>talking to it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Put shut.</v>

470
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.220
<v Speaker 7>God.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You ever seen Bronson?</v>

471
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.630
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Amazing.</v>

472

473
00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.493
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I saw that.</v>

474
00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.350
<v Speaker 7>He was really good in that he's giving</v>
<v Speaker 7>everything.</v>

475
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.100
<v Speaker 7>He's just one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He just knows how to just knows how to</v>

476
00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:22.110
<v Speaker 7>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

477
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.550
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a weird type of um,</v>

478
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:31.090
<v Speaker 7>like a respect we have for people also</v>
<v Speaker 7>that come from other countries.</v>

479
00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:37.300
<v Speaker 7>Mean Americans love Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but we also hold people from other</v>

480
00:21:37.331 --> 00:21:38.950
<v Speaker 7>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Have you have an English accent?</v>

481
00:21:38.951 --> 00:21:40.300
<v Speaker 7>Will cut.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You all lost.</v>

482
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.480
<v Speaker 7>My God,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we love slack.</v>

483
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.140
<v Speaker 7>No</v>
<v Speaker 7>major raise.</v>

484
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:50.590
<v Speaker 7>It's everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everybody everywhere.</v>

485
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.530
<v Speaker 7>There's British accents everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 7>everywhere,</v>

486
00:21:53.531 --> 00:21:57.130
<v Speaker 7>every show.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because I only watch normal TV when I'm</v>

487
00:21:57.131 --> 00:22:00.010
<v Speaker 7>at a hotel and I've been doing the road</v>
<v Speaker 7>a lot lately,</v>

488
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:05.170
<v Speaker 7>so I've been stuck watching commercials</v>
<v Speaker 7>for the first time anyway.</v>

489
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.880
<v Speaker 7>Every I watched world problems.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I watched this James Corden or whatever</v>

490
00:22:11.351 --> 00:22:12.700
<v Speaker 7>they've been.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

491
00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.550
<v Speaker 7>he was in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's the guy that just took over for</v>

492
00:22:15.551 --> 00:22:16.940
<v Speaker 7>Craig Ferguson.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

493
00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:20.350
<v Speaker 7>what's also had an accent.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Everybody has an accent now on</v>

494
00:22:20.351 --> 00:22:21.450
<v Speaker 7>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Don't you think?</v>

495
00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Speaker 7>Craig Ferguson was good though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I liked Craig Ferguson.</v>

496
00:22:23.861 --> 00:22:25.270
<v Speaker 7>He was really good.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Totally good.</v>

497
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.800
<v Speaker 7>He brought a different element when it</v>
<v Speaker 7>was the Brittany spears thing when that</v>

498
00:22:29.801 --> 00:22:32.560
<v Speaker 7>Brittany spears thing was going on and</v>
<v Speaker 7>she was shaving her head and he was</v>

499
00:22:32.561 --> 00:22:33.670
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>why aren't we doing this?</v>

500
00:22:33.671 --> 00:22:36.670
<v Speaker 7>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why would we like attack this girl?</v>

501
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.700
<v Speaker 7>And I think in a lot of ways like his,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like sort of reasonable approach to</v>

502
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:45.730
<v Speaker 7>addressing the subject instead of like</v>
<v Speaker 7>cracking jokes about it when it was like</v>

503
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.600
<v Speaker 7>she was shaving her head and just like</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're,</v>

504
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.010
<v Speaker 7>you're looking at a person that's having</v>
<v Speaker 7>some,</v>

505
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.950
<v Speaker 7>some serious stress and mental problems</v>
<v Speaker 7>probably.</v>

506
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.680
<v Speaker 7>And all we're doing is just piling onto</v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

507
00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:01.030
<v Speaker 7>And he made this like really reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 7>measured plea and I remember thinking</v>

508
00:23:01.031 --> 00:23:01.571
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wow,</v>

509
00:23:01.571 --> 00:23:04.070
<v Speaker 7>that was a genuine thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like that wasn't a,</v>

510
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:09.570
<v Speaker 7>that didn't seem like some of fake</v>
<v Speaker 7>pumped up pr move to try to get people</v>

511
00:23:12.761 --> 00:23:15.520
<v Speaker 7>to view him a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It seemed very genuine.</v>

512
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.430
<v Speaker 7>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>unfortunately Brittany spears wasn't</v>

513
00:23:18.431 --> 00:23:21.650
<v Speaker 7>watching Craig Ferguson messages never</v>
<v Speaker 7>got throats.</v>

514
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:23.290
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people did leave her alone.</v>

515
00:23:23.291 --> 00:23:26.230
<v Speaker 7>They kind of leave her alone now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But she was obviously having some sort</v>

516
00:23:26.231 --> 00:23:27.390
<v Speaker 7>of a breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

517
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.100
<v Speaker 7>she was something going on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was,</v>

518
00:23:29.101 --> 00:23:31.600
<v Speaker 7>she was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I don't know if anybody could ever</v>

519
00:23:31.601 --> 00:23:36.601
<v Speaker 7>be expected to respond well to the kind</v>
<v Speaker 7>of stress that someone in her position</v>

520
00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:39.490
<v Speaker 7>and doors.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She's like some stupid,</v>

521
00:23:39.491 --> 00:23:43.720
<v Speaker 7>crazy superstar,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a beyonce type character or Jamesy</v>

522
00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.130
<v Speaker 7>like that of stress.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Level's</v>

523
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.700
<v Speaker 8>got to be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 8>She's calmed down a lot.</v>

524
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:51.980
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>She does that thing in Vegas now.</v>

<v Speaker 8>I was supposed to start mine with him.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was going to be my cohost and then I</v>

571
00:25:54.331 --> 00:25:57.810
<v Speaker 8>decided not to have a cohort.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's that the last time he also really</v>

572
00:25:57.811 --> 00:25:58.260
<v Speaker 8>busy.</v>

<v Speaker 7>It's not like you have 52 different</v>

574
00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:03.180
<v Speaker 7>things you have to do all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You could do another podcast once a week</v>

575
00:26:03.181 --> 00:26:04.060
<v Speaker 7>with him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Sharp.</v>

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:17.880
<v Speaker 7>Such a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He just loves joke writing so much does</v>

579
00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.640
<v Speaker 7>and so when these guys come in with a</v>
<v Speaker 7>premise or whatever,</v>

580
00:26:20.641 --> 00:26:21.520
<v Speaker 7>he'll just go,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 7>heard that premise and punchline,</v>

584
00:26:27.060 --> 00:26:30.390
<v Speaker 7>but it's all restructured.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He just repeats it back because he has</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's a normal guy.</v>

600
00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:13.840
<v Speaker 2>The only one I ever seen Chris Mcguire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stomach reference like that might be the</v>

601
00:27:14.391 --> 00:27:18.000
<v Speaker 2>most difficult to put your head around</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you don't know Chris Mcguire,</v>

602
00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:19.160
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup comedian.</v>

604
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.750
<v Speaker 2>It's normal stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looks like a normal guy.</v>

605
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:29.390
<v Speaker 2>If he's standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's stupid to be sure that that was</v>

00:27:29.391 --> 00:27:31.760
<v Speaker 2>his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you had like if you saw joey</v>

611
00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.960
<v Speaker 2>If you saw silhouette and someone said</v>

<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

617
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:52.440
<v Speaker 2>I wish he'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me see.</v>

618
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's um,</v>

619
00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:55.480
<v Speaker 2>he's a great guy to Christopher Dwyer,</v>

620
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.750
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Greg Fitzsimmons and I started out like</v>

621
00:27:57.751 --> 00:27:59.880
<v Speaker 4>within a week of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy.</v>

622
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.040
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting.</v>

623
00:28:02.041 --> 00:28:05.520
<v Speaker 4>All these years later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have that same thing with a few guys</v>

624
00:28:05.521 --> 00:28:08.850
<v Speaker 4>and it's amazing because there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely like a special bond that</v>

625
00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:09.740
<v Speaker 4>happens when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

626
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.670
<v Speaker 4>this started around the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

627
00:28:11.671 --> 00:28:12.810
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You hadn't,</v>

628
00:28:12.811 --> 00:28:17.370
<v Speaker 4>you'd known each other through the whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>process of being fucking horrible,</v>

629
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:21.770
<v Speaker 4>totally incompetent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just starry eyed for the,</v>

630
00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:25.650
<v Speaker 4>the idea of being a comic and chasing</v>
<v Speaker 4>these dreams together and there's</v>

631
00:28:25.651 --> 00:28:28.950
<v Speaker 4>nothing more fun than when you see one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of those guys doing something cool,</v>

632
00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.740
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's cool to see in comics do</v>

633
00:28:31.741 --> 00:28:34.350
<v Speaker 4>something cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we all been talking about this at</v>

634
00:28:34.351 --> 00:28:38.310
<v Speaker 4>the store lately that this is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>things about this generation and this,</v>

635
00:28:38.311 --> 00:28:40.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this era as it were,</v>

636
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.170
<v Speaker 4>is that a good thing to say this era of</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy,</v>

637
00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:47.280
<v Speaker 4>but this time is that people like comics</v>
<v Speaker 4>are real supportive of each other and I</v>

638
00:28:47.281 --> 00:28:50.940
<v Speaker 4>don't think that ever existed before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There wasn't like a bunch of comics</v>

639
00:28:50.941 --> 00:28:54.510
<v Speaker 4>promoting each other on shows like the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way people are now.</v>

640
00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.630
<v Speaker 4>It didn't really exist before because</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were so few spots.</v>

641
00:28:57.631 --> 00:28:59.610
<v Speaker 4>Like if you got on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had a coveted,</v>

642
00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:00.720
<v Speaker 4>you had it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is mine,</v>

643
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:05.520
<v Speaker 4>it was like this famine mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now that a lot of what we're doing</v>

644
00:29:05.521 --> 00:29:08.240
<v Speaker 4>is internet driven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's your Netflix special</v>

645
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:11.590
<v Speaker 2>which comes out this Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>January eight,</v>

646
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:13.580
<v Speaker 2>18th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>January,</v>

647
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.423
<v Speaker 2>fifth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15th,</v>

648
00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.400
<v Speaker 4>one shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's available this Friday.</v>

649
00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:22.580
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's stuff like that which is</v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet based in which is almost all of</v>

650
00:29:22.581 --> 00:29:24.320
<v Speaker 4>the fucking specials that you're hearing</v>
<v Speaker 4>about now,</v>

651
00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:29.180
<v Speaker 4>are these Internet based specials and</v>
<v Speaker 4>television shows that are Internet</v>

652
00:29:29.181 --> 00:29:30.740
<v Speaker 4>based.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean Netflix is just.</v>

653
00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.900
<v Speaker 4>They have so much fucking programming</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

654
00:29:32.901 --> 00:29:36.710
<v Speaker 4>There's so many different things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can watch that are Internet based,</v>

655
00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:41.080
<v Speaker 4>but I think comics have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like most of us have gotten to podcast a</v>

656
00:29:41.081 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 4>giant amount of</v>

657
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.790
<v Speaker 6>us and he realized like this is way more</v>
<v Speaker 6>fun and way easier to do than a</v>

658
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:49.870
<v Speaker 6>television show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And through that everybody says you</v>

659
00:29:49.871 --> 00:29:51.130
<v Speaker 6>should do it too and you should do it</v>
<v Speaker 6>too.</v>

660
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:55.360
<v Speaker 6>And they all do it together and he</v>
<v Speaker 6>developed this weird network and this is</v>

661
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.560
<v Speaker 6>like a network of supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think when we all see someone who's</v>

662
00:29:59.561 --> 00:30:01.180
<v Speaker 6>doing really good,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

663
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:02.830
<v Speaker 6>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's interesting.</v>

664
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.450
<v Speaker 6>It's interesting to watch like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ooh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>that a lot of people like.</v>

675
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:29.090
<v Speaker 6>It's like trying to find the right</v>
<v Speaker 6>vehicle for it.</v>

<v Speaker 6>it's something that you can pursue and</v>

693
00:31:09.011 --> 00:31:11.800
<v Speaker 6>like you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to talk to this interesting</v>

694
00:31:11.801 --> 00:31:14.050
<v Speaker 6>person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to talk to this cool guy,</v>

695
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.930
<v Speaker 6>like maybe I can get him on my podcast</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then all of a sudden you get them</v>

696
00:31:16.931 --> 00:31:19.660
<v Speaker 6>and you're sitting there talking to this</v>
<v Speaker 6>person and as a Pir,</v>

697
00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:22.750
<v Speaker 6>as a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if you're allowed to pursue your</v>

698
00:31:22.751 --> 00:31:26.530
<v Speaker 6>interests like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very enriching and I think what the</v>

699
00:31:26.531 --> 00:31:29.620
<v Speaker 6>audience gets out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's such a fucking pompous word,</v>

700
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:30.850
<v Speaker 6>but that is what it's like.</v>

701
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:33.280
<v Speaker 6>It's like enriching and what the</v>
<v Speaker 6>audience gets out of it.</v>

702
00:31:33.281 --> 00:31:38.170
<v Speaker 6>It's like they get to go on this like</v>
<v Speaker 6>really cool adventure with you and some</v>

703
00:31:38.171 --> 00:31:41.410
<v Speaker 6>of the best aspects of the adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like having conversations with these</v>

704
00:31:41.411 --> 00:31:44.470
<v Speaker 6>cool and funny and interesting people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They get to be in on them.</v>

705
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.210
<v Speaker 6>They get to sit there and be a part of</v>
<v Speaker 6>like your little adventure through</v>

706
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:53.110
<v Speaker 6>choosing your interests and so that's</v>
<v Speaker 6>what I think everybody should have every</v>

707
00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:57.250
<v Speaker 6>like comic who has any interest in</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatsoever should have a podcast because</v>

708
00:31:57.251 --> 00:32:00.340
<v Speaker 6>you get to see them go down there a</v>
<v Speaker 6>little.</v>

709
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.100
<v Speaker 6>The adventure of their interests,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

710
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.860
<v Speaker 6>like if you listen to bill birth</v>
<v Speaker 6>podcast,</v>

711
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.060
<v Speaker 6>like I don't pay attention to football,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so the only part I can't listen to it</v>

712
00:32:08.061 --> 00:32:10.270
<v Speaker 6>when he started talking about football</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they should've done this and the</v>

713
00:32:10.271 --> 00:32:13.210
<v Speaker 6>defense was that I'd done because he's a</v>
<v Speaker 6>football fanatic,</v>

714
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:18.420
<v Speaker 6>but the rest of it is just bill talking</v>
<v Speaker 6>about how he's living his life and how</v>

715
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:20.560
<v Speaker 6>he's going through his life.</v>

716
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.820
<v Speaker 6>And it's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really interesting to follow</v>

717
00:32:24.821 --> 00:32:29.400
<v Speaker 6>someone follow their interests.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Follow like what make,</v>

718
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:30.910
<v Speaker 6>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's curious to them.</v>

719
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.240
<v Speaker 6>Like when you don't have any other</v>
<v Speaker 6>agenda like in your agenda isn't man</v>

720
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.510
<v Speaker 6>what we need to get good ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're going to need to get some people</v>

721
00:32:37.511 --> 00:32:39.950
<v Speaker 6>in here that are doing some things that</v>
<v Speaker 6>people are aware of.</v>

722
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.740
<v Speaker 6>Which is how you think of like every</v>
<v Speaker 6>other talk show,</v>

723
00:32:42.741 --> 00:32:45.890
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They all become almost generic in a way</v>

724
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:50.270
<v Speaker 6>because even like letterman who was like</v>
<v Speaker 6>fiercely independent and very smart and</v>

725
00:32:50.271 --> 00:32:54.770
<v Speaker 6>just overly critical of like shitty</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff and a smart guy like didn't like</v>

726
00:32:54.771 --> 00:32:56.780
<v Speaker 6>his own stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Half the time he would do his own show</v>

727
00:32:56.781 --> 00:32:58.070
<v Speaker 6>and it would be brilliant and he'd be</v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

728
00:32:58.071 --> 00:33:01.040
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hate myself that he was crazy like</v>

729
00:33:01.041 --> 00:33:01.461
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

730
00:33:01.461 --> 00:33:04.100
<v Speaker 6>That was like the thing about Letterman,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but who would he have on his show?</v>

731
00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:07.580
<v Speaker 6>He's like regular people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man who sell on a fucking movie,</v>

732
00:33:07.581 --> 00:33:09.800
<v Speaker 6>who selling a song,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who selling to this,</v>

733
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.440
<v Speaker 6>who's got a TV show and it does the same</v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

734
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:17.030
<v Speaker 6>And so David have humorous or a</v>
<v Speaker 6>conversation with these people and say</v>

735
00:33:17.031 --> 00:33:19.460
<v Speaker 6>funny stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the bottom line is that's not who he</v>

736
00:33:19.461 --> 00:33:21.920
<v Speaker 6>chooses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's not what he wants to do.</v>

737
00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:22.701
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If he,</v>

738
00:33:22.701 --> 00:33:25.010
<v Speaker 6>if you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all cost aside,</v>

739
00:33:25.011 --> 00:33:28.130
<v Speaker 6>all consideration of ratings aside,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who would you want to talk to Dave?</v>

740
00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.030
<v Speaker 6>Then you would get a chance to see,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the way the system is set up,</v>

741
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:36.020
<v Speaker 6>even though it's a fantastic system,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it works out and you get something</v>

742
00:33:36.021 --> 00:33:38.900
<v Speaker 6>like the Jimmy Fallon tonight show,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which I think is excellent,</v>

743
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.180
<v Speaker 6>I think Jimmy Fallon's the best tonight</v>
<v Speaker 6>show guy ever.</v>

744
00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.360
<v Speaker 6>I have a showcase for it tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think he's the best.</v>

745
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.153
<v Speaker 6>He's fucking great.</v>

746
00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:49.890
<v Speaker 5>I can't talk about anything that I've</v>
<v Speaker 5>been working on and that's what's funny</v>

747
00:33:49.891 --> 00:33:51.180
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have this brand new,</v>

748
00:33:51.181 --> 00:33:54.900
<v Speaker 5>a 15 minute chunk that I'm just in love</v>
<v Speaker 5>with right now,</v>

749
00:33:54.901 --> 00:33:58.530
<v Speaker 5>like it's just expanding and breathing</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm talking about crazy,</v>

750
00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:02.280
<v Speaker 5>crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I thought I was thinking about it on</v>

751
00:34:02.281 --> 00:34:03.780
<v Speaker 5>the way here because I just got the</v>
<v Speaker 5>call.</v>

752
00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:04.800
<v Speaker 5>My manager is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

753
00:34:04.801 --> 00:34:07.230
<v Speaker 5>are you available to do a tonight show</v>
<v Speaker 5>showcase tonight?</v>

754
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:08.580
<v Speaker 5>And I'm literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

755
00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.480
<v Speaker 5>heck yeah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah blah.</v>

756
00:34:09.481 --> 00:34:12.030
<v Speaker 5>And I'd get off the phone and I start</v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking about everything I've been</v>

757
00:34:12.031 --> 00:34:15.090
<v Speaker 5>working out and I know for a fact I</v>
<v Speaker 5>can't do any of it.</v>

758
00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.260
<v Speaker 5>Not a single bit.</v>

759
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.870
<v Speaker 2>That sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

760
00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:19.760
<v Speaker 2>You get these new weapons.</v>

761
00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.210
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they're right there and I know I</v>

762
00:34:22.211 --> 00:34:24.850
<v Speaker 5>would kill harder than anybody else on</v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

763
00:34:24.851 --> 00:34:27.700
<v Speaker 5>I don't even know who's on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just know like how I feel about my</v>

764
00:34:27.701 --> 00:34:31.000
<v Speaker 5>material right now is like I'm in like</v>
<v Speaker 5>championship mode.</v>

765
00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.880
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with this new stuff though,</v>

766
00:34:33.881 --> 00:34:37.360
<v Speaker 5>that's what's crazy is I'm going to have</v>
<v Speaker 5>to really figure out and fanangle</v>

767
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:39.890
<v Speaker 2>thank [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well let's look at it this way.</v>

768
00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:42.860
<v Speaker 2>But think of the tonight show with no</v>
<v Speaker 2>censorship.</v>

769
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.830
<v Speaker 2>Think of the tonight show on Netflix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lead with that show.</v>

770
00:34:45.831 --> 00:34:48.470
<v Speaker 2>But totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How good would that show be if someone</v>

771
00:34:48.471 --> 00:34:53.000
<v Speaker 2>like Jamie Foxx could go on and sit next</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the couch and say whatever the fuck</v>

772
00:34:53.001 --> 00:34:54.230
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

773
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.980
<v Speaker 2>someone like Mike Tyson swearing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know some.</v>

774
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Why don't I go with two black people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love your Jamie Foxx.</v>

775
00:34:59.781 --> 00:35:01.190
<v Speaker 2>Love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>

776
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:06.380
<v Speaker 2>I think Jamie Foxx is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you heard his interview with Tim</v>

777
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:06.770
<v Speaker 2>Ferriss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>

778
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:08.570
<v Speaker 2>you would look at him in a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

779
00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Like I've always thought he's insanely</v>
<v Speaker 2>talented.</v>

780
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:14.330
<v Speaker 2>I like the fact that he could play Ray</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charles and then he played that.</v>

781
00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm the guy with mental illness that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a homeless guy who was a musician and</v>

782
00:35:18.141 --> 00:35:22.040
<v Speaker 2>the Robert Downey jr movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he can act his fucking ass</v>

783
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:26.230
<v Speaker 5>and he's singing in Django unchained.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

784
00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:27.123
<v Speaker 5>unbelievable.</v>

785
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:28.240
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

786
00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:31.140
<v Speaker 2>you listened to his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he talks to tim first,</v>

787
00:35:31.141 --> 00:35:33.600
<v Speaker 2>you kind of get an understanding of why</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the way he is.</v>

788
00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.240
<v Speaker 2>Just a bad motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a super talented,</v>

789
00:35:36.241 --> 00:35:38.100
<v Speaker 2>super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super sharp thinking.</v>

790
00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.690
<v Speaker 7>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Interesting.</v>

791
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.110
<v Speaker 7>I love that guys like that exist.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

792
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:44.010
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>do,</v>

793
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.200
<v Speaker 7>you don't necessarily want to do what</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're doing,</v>

794
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:50.160
<v Speaker 7>but just knowing that there's people</v>
<v Speaker 7>like that that exists,</v>

795
00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:51.150
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>wow,</v>

<v Speaker 7>fucking super high level with a lot of</v>

798
00:35:57.841 --> 00:36:00.480
<v Speaker 7>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like Jamie Foxx can sing his ass off.</v>

799
00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:02.190
<v Speaker 7>Like he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he's a really good,</v>

800
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:05.430
<v Speaker 7>totally insane.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like he could have,</v>

801
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.280
<v Speaker 7>he could just do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he could do any one of those careers</v>

802
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:09.960
<v Speaker 7>regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I know it's interesting,</v>

803
00:36:09.961 --> 00:36:11.490
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's interesting.</v>

804
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:13.320
<v Speaker 7>He,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how much standup he does</v>

805
00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:14.740
<v Speaker 7>anymore though.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

<v Speaker 7>ridiculous it is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know?</v>

867
00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:03.430
<v Speaker 7>You just don't think they realize that</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's you're in the middle of this piece</v>

868
00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.940
<v Speaker 7>and this piece is a lot of places that</v>
<v Speaker 7>it has to go to.</v>

869
00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:09.940
<v Speaker 7>You have to go left and you have to go</v>
<v Speaker 7>right and you have to trick them a</v>

870
00:39:09.941 --> 00:39:13.900
<v Speaker 7>little bit and then you bring it home at</v>
<v Speaker 7>the end and this woman is like in the</v>

871
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.170
<v Speaker 7>middle of this thing screaming out and</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's interesting because I'm,</v>

872
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:20.350
<v Speaker 7>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and I've tried here and there with jokes</v>

873
00:39:20.351 --> 00:39:21.111
<v Speaker 7>over,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

874
00:39:21.111 --> 00:39:25.900
<v Speaker 7>the eight years of doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm never really a a political guy,</v>

875
00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:29.230
<v Speaker 7>but with this new election thing that</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm doing right now,</v>

876
00:39:29.231 --> 00:39:33.820
<v Speaker 7>I feel really good about it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but it's amazing how the different</v>

877
00:39:33.821 --> 00:39:38.821
<v Speaker 7>reactions that you get around the</v>
<v Speaker 7>country doing this dust is a charged</v>

878
00:39:39.581 --> 00:39:40.414
<v Speaker 7>subject.</v>

879
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:45.600
<v Speaker 7>It's a charged subject in a weird time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is probably the weirdest selection</v>

880
00:39:46.151 --> 00:39:50.830
<v Speaker 7>ever because this is the only election I</v>
<v Speaker 7>can ever remember where there's only one</v>

881
00:39:50.831 --> 00:39:54.400
<v Speaker 7>candidate that his supporters are really</v>
<v Speaker 7>fucking excited about them.</v>

882
00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:57.640
<v Speaker 7>And then there's a bunch of other people</v>
<v Speaker 7>that you're like,</v>

883
00:39:57.641 --> 00:39:58.900
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

884
00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:02.020
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean like Bernie Sanders seems like a</v>

885
00:40:02.021 --> 00:40:03.460
<v Speaker 7>really Nice Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

886
00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:05.410

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.011
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

888
00:40:06.011 --> 00:40:11.011
<v Speaker 7>maybe he's the best of all the choices</v>
<v Speaker 7>available except for people make money.</v>

889
00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:15.730
<v Speaker 7>I'd love it if you got in.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd love it if he just interesting won</v>

890
00:40:15.731 --> 00:40:17.170
<v Speaker 7>the election.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was just like,</v>

891
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:19.090
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was just fucking with you guys the</v>

892
00:40:19.091 --> 00:40:19.924
<v Speaker 7>whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm a,</v>

893
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.720
<v Speaker 7>I'm an old white man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Go fuck yourselves.</v>

894
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.650
<v Speaker 7>Back to the old system,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

895
00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.560
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think he would survive.</v>

896
00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:28.210
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he already looks like he's done a few</v>

897
00:40:28.211 --> 00:40:29.650
<v Speaker 7>terms,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>

898
00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:30.483
<v Speaker 7>Like does,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

899
00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:33.070
<v Speaker 7>All these other presidents go in there</v>
<v Speaker 7>looking good,</v>

900
00:40:33.071 --> 00:40:35.560
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dark brown hair and then they all come</v>

901
00:40:35.561 --> 00:40:37.480
<v Speaker 7>out looking like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

902
00:40:37.481 --> 00:40:39.640
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what's his name?</v>

903
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.550
<v Speaker 7>But not who we're talking about Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look at Obama.</v>

904
00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:43.160
<v Speaker 7>We,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've,</v>

905
00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:47.230
<v Speaker 7>we've shown side by side images of him</v>
<v Speaker 7>from 2009 to 2015.</v>

906
00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:50.530
<v Speaker 7>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He looks like he's aged like 20 plus</v>

907
00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:51.364
<v Speaker 7>years.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

908
00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:53.290
<v Speaker 7>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's hard job,</v>

909
00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.420
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think anybody can do it.</v>

910
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.380
<v Speaker 7>I think at one point in time we're going</v>
<v Speaker 7>to realize that the idea that we keep</v>

911
00:40:59.381 --> 00:41:03.910
<v Speaker 7>clinging to have a single guy that's in</v>
<v Speaker 7>charge of the whole country is stupid.</v>

912
00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:07.930
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like why would you have one person be in</v>

913
00:41:07.931 --> 00:41:10.600
<v Speaker 7>charge of anything?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why don't have like a giant,</v>

914
00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:15.720
<v Speaker 7>gigantic team of people and why not have</v>
<v Speaker 7>the influence of the public a daily</v>

915
00:41:16.151 --> 00:41:19.720
<v Speaker 7>basis be tuned into this gigantic group</v>
<v Speaker 7>of people with,</v>

916
00:41:19.721 --> 00:41:24.721
<v Speaker 7>of course reasonable filters for</v>
<v Speaker 7>hysterics when something crazy happens</v>

917
00:41:25.601 --> 00:41:27.570
<v Speaker 7>and all of a sudden people want to nuke,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

918
00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.610
<v Speaker 7>some country or something like that</v>
<v Speaker 7>system to change.</v>

919
00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 7>What's amazing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think that we would have to have</v>

920
00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:39.110
<v Speaker 5>basically a trump as a president for</v>
<v Speaker 5>people to really have a discussion over</v>

921
00:41:39.111 --> 00:41:41.420
<v Speaker 5>four years about how things have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>change because of,</v>

922
00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:44.690
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it depends on how he does at the same</v>

923
00:41:44.691 --> 00:41:45.730
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

924
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:49.460
<v Speaker 5>there's some of the things he says like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I actually can,</v>

925
00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.840
<v Speaker 5>like the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

926
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:54.170
<v Speaker 5>I was just walking out of a hotel and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the news was on the TV and it says,</v>

927
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.110
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trump says that Germany terrorist</v>

928
00:41:57.111 --> 00:41:59.360
<v Speaker 5>attacks or because they let those people</v>
<v Speaker 5>in.</v>

929
00:41:59.970 --> 00:42:02.360
<v Speaker 5>That's all that I saw at first.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

930
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.160
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what an idiotic thing to say.</v>

931
00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.510
<v Speaker 5>And then I thought about it and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

932
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:07.130
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they did let what,</v>

933
00:42:07.131 --> 00:42:09.920
<v Speaker 5>like a million people in or something</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>

934
00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:10.720
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

935
00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:12.790
<v Speaker 6>there's a real issue in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

936
00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:17.850
<v Speaker 6>and the mayor of Cologne,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is in this insane move was telling</v>

937
00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:25.150
<v Speaker 6>women how they should behave around</v>
<v Speaker 6>these men and that they should stay</v>

938
00:42:25.151 --> 00:42:29.290
<v Speaker 6>within arm's length.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking crazy.</v>

939
00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:32.260
<v Speaker 6>It's victim blaming.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean they're resorting to victim</v>

940
00:42:32.261 --> 00:42:36.610
<v Speaker 6>blaming to try to take focus away from</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fact that what they've done is</v>

941
00:42:36.611 --> 00:42:39.670
<v Speaker 6>they've led in a bunch of people from</v>
<v Speaker 6>another culture who behave differently.</v>

942
00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:43.720
<v Speaker 6>It's maybe not their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maybe let's look at it this way.</v>

943
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:46.780
<v Speaker 6>This is the way they lived in their</v>
<v Speaker 6>other country.</v>

944
00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.530
<v Speaker 6>They're coming into your country.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going to behave the way they've</v>

945
00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:53.050
<v Speaker 6>behaved all 37 years of their life</v>
<v Speaker 6>because that's what they do,</v>

946
00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:56.830
<v Speaker 6>and so now you have to deal with that in</v>
<v Speaker 6>your culture and the way to deal with is</v>

947
00:42:56.831 --> 00:43:00.970
<v Speaker 6>not to say women should fucking stay</v>
<v Speaker 6>arms length away from these people is to</v>

948
00:43:00.971 --> 00:43:03.760
<v Speaker 6>educate these people about the rules of</v>
<v Speaker 6>this place.</v>

949
00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:07.030
<v Speaker 6>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't just sexually assault women.</v>

950
00:43:07.031 --> 00:43:09.280
<v Speaker 6>They're going to get drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Girls could dress however the fuck they</v>

951
00:43:09.281 --> 00:43:12.280
<v Speaker 6>want and you can't tell those girls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Now you're on your own.</v>

952
00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:14.410
<v Speaker 6>You just have to stay arms length away</v>
<v Speaker 6>from somebody.</v>

953
00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:17.440
<v Speaker 6>You can't because everybody's so scared</v>
<v Speaker 6>of being racist.</v>

954
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.650
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's so scared of being</v>
<v Speaker 6>Islamophobic that they don't want to</v>

955
00:43:20.651 --> 00:43:25.510
<v Speaker 6>point out the forget about ideologies or</v>
<v Speaker 6>forget about skin color,</v>

956
00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:27.910
<v Speaker 6>people of origin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have some people that are doing</v>

957
00:43:27.911 --> 00:43:31.300
<v Speaker 6>something that's not good to some people</v>
<v Speaker 6>that haven't had these things done to</v>

958
00:43:31.301 --> 00:43:33.670
<v Speaker 6>them like this before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to figure out what to do.</v>

959
00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:37.300
<v Speaker 6>You got you let in a different culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not,</v>

960
00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:39.220
<v Speaker 6>it's not their fault,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it is.</v>

961
00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:40.720
<v Speaker 6>It is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>

962
00:43:40.721 --> 00:43:41.381
<v Speaker 6>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

963
00:43:41.381 --> 00:43:43.900
<v Speaker 6>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't deny that it exists.</v>

964
00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:45.250
<v Speaker 6>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it is a thing,</v>

965
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:48.670
<v Speaker 6>and there's a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

966
00:43:48.671 --> 00:43:53.671
<v Speaker 6>that were pointing to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're pointing to letting people like</v>

967
00:43:54.551 --> 00:43:55.950
<v Speaker 6>that in this country and they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

968
00:43:55.951 --> 00:43:57.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what are we going to do?</v>

969
00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.860
<v Speaker 6>What are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have Syrian refugees coming to America?</v>

970
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:03.070
<v Speaker 6>I was just gonna invite a million Syrian</v>
<v Speaker 6>refugees in America.</v>

971
00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:06.910
<v Speaker 6>And if you look at the history of</v>
<v Speaker 6>America,</v>

972
00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.310
<v Speaker 6>that's what people have always done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We've always led in.</v>

973
00:44:09.311 --> 00:44:10.960
<v Speaker 6>People from other countries are trying</v>
<v Speaker 6>to get away.</v>

974
00:44:10.961 --> 00:44:12.400
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's how this country got founded.</v>

975
00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.470
<v Speaker 6>So ideally we'd all want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

976
00:44:14.471 --> 00:44:17.800
<v Speaker 6>these are the people that are running</v>
<v Speaker 6>away from the people that are doing</v>

977
00:44:17.801 --> 00:44:20.620
<v Speaker 6>terrible things to them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you're going to get some shitheads</v>

978
00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:22.210
<v Speaker 6>who definitely going to get some</v>
<v Speaker 6>shitheads.</v>

979
00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:24.370
<v Speaker 6>So how do you deal with that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a good question.</v>

980
00:44:24.371 --> 00:44:25.840
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that's a question for one</v>
<v Speaker 6>person.</v>

981
00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:27.820
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even in one person at a cabinet and when</v>

982
00:44:27.821 --> 00:44:31.980
<v Speaker 6>one person has veto power and what man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there</v>

983
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.750
<v Speaker 4>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking team of phds and Super Smart</v>

984
00:44:36.751 --> 00:44:41.610
<v Speaker 4>motherfuckers with who get evaluated on</v>
<v Speaker 4>a regular basis for ego problems,</v>

985
00:44:41.611 --> 00:44:43.410
<v Speaker 4>alcoholism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of the above.</v>

986
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:44.244
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should have,</v>

987
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:48.420
<v Speaker 4>if you're testing mixed martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighter to see if they're on steroids,</v>

988
00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:50.940
<v Speaker 4>you should be testing congressmen and</v>
<v Speaker 4>senators.</v>

989
00:44:50.941 --> 00:44:52.850
<v Speaker 4>See if they're fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

990

992
00:44:56.281 --> 00:44:57.770

<v Speaker 4>It's affecting your judgment.</v>

<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1004
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.020
<v Speaker 4>Congressmen and Senators and</v>
<v Speaker 4>representatives.</v>

1005
00:45:31.021 --> 00:45:33.990
<v Speaker 4>State representatives is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>representative government.</v>

1006
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:38.070
<v Speaker 4>It's all a pot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weird popularity contests like Arnold</v>

1007
00:45:38.070 --> 00:45:40.800
<v Speaker 4>Schwarzenegger was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The governor like that doesn't make any</v>

1008
00:45:40.801 --> 00:45:41.910
<v Speaker 4>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it does.</v>

1009
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:46.830
<v Speaker 4>He's a fiscal conservative guy who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>open minded in a sense of like socially</v>

1010
00:45:46.831 --> 00:45:51.831
<v Speaker 4>open minded like as in terms of how he</v>
<v Speaker 4>views a gay people and and even</v>

1011
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:57.150
<v Speaker 4>recreational drug use and things along</v>
<v Speaker 4>those lines is a very open minded almost</v>

1012
00:45:57.151 --> 00:46:00.060
<v Speaker 4>like with a libertarian bent but a</v>
<v Speaker 4>Republican,</v>

1013
00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:03.120
<v Speaker 4>so it actually wasn't a bad choice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't do a great job,</v>

1014
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:06.080
<v Speaker 4>but guess what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're dealing with a bunch a shit,</v>

1015
00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.690
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of red tape and bullshit and if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you ever hear him describe his time in</v>

1016
00:46:09.691 --> 00:46:11.940
<v Speaker 4>office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty interesting stuff like you</v>

1017
00:46:11.941 --> 00:46:14.220
<v Speaker 4>don't realize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think from the outside like some like</v>

1018
00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:19.360
<v Speaker 4>Uri have zero political aspirations or</v>
<v Speaker 4>motivations or once you get in man,</v>

1019
00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:26.570
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with this insane system</v>
<v Speaker 4>of like how things get done and how</v>

1020
00:46:28.111 --> 00:46:32.940
<v Speaker 4>people will filibuster and people will</v>
<v Speaker 4>block this because it'll anger their</v>

1021
00:46:32.941 --> 00:46:36.720
<v Speaker 4>constituents because these people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>paying for that and these people are</v>

1022
00:46:36.721 --> 00:46:39.390
<v Speaker 4>paying you to make sure that this</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't pass through because that'll get</v>

1023
00:46:39.391 --> 00:46:40.710
<v Speaker 4>that through watch house of cards.</v>

1024
00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:41.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just started.</v>

1025
00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.890
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my favorite thing.</v>

1026
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how accurate it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if it's even fucking 10 percent,</v>

1027
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:50.760
<v Speaker 4>we're doing fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ten percent.</v>

1028
00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.030
<v Speaker 4>It's a great show though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kevin Spacey is a bad motherfucker.</v>

1029
00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:57.000
<v Speaker 4>I love it when he looks at the camera</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just starts talking.</v>

1030
00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.520
<v Speaker 4>He's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a different guy in this.</v>

1031
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.540
<v Speaker 4>He's a different guy in the show with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>very distinct accent and you buy it.</v>

1032
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.060
<v Speaker 4>You're not going like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's Kevin Spacey,</v>

1033
00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.080
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

1034
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.600
<v Speaker 4>He just becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That person becomes another person.</v>

1035
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:12.300
<v Speaker 4>Frank Underwood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going on with that shirt?</v>

1036
00:47:12.301 --> 00:47:13.320
<v Speaker 4>Brian?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>

1037
00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:14.780
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1038
00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:17.020
<v Speaker 4>the security guard shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>

1039
00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:21.060
<v Speaker 4>Thrift stores.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny when I wear it because I went</v>

1040
00:47:21.061 --> 00:47:23.670
<v Speaker 4>to starbucks and Mexicans gave me double</v>
<v Speaker 4>looks real quick.</v>

1041
00:47:23.671 --> 00:47:27.090
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty funny how rude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so racist,</v>

1042
00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:28.980
<v Speaker 4>but it happened twice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Today.</v>

1043
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:29.913
<v Speaker 4>Happened twice</v>

1044
00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:34.000
<v Speaker 2>when.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is it that they chose a blue color</v>

1045
00:47:34.001 --> 00:47:37.120
<v Speaker 2>with like a dark blue pocket thing for</v>
<v Speaker 2>security.</v>

1046
00:47:37.121 --> 00:47:40.660
<v Speaker 2>That's universal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like he got his badge ripped</v>

1047
00:47:40.661 --> 00:47:44.320
<v Speaker 2>off of them and because it's maybe did</v>
<v Speaker 2>it himself when he quit.</v>

1048
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.370
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1049
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:48.550
<v Speaker 2>that's what you want to do when you quit</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sheriff's department.</v>

1050
00:47:48.551 --> 00:47:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pull that star off and you throw it on</v>

1051
00:47:50.561 --> 00:47:51.580
<v Speaker 2>the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done.</v>

1052
00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:54.160
<v Speaker 2>You've watched making a murderer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1053
00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.350
<v Speaker 2>I have not watched waking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1054
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:57.340
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep hearing that.</v>

1055
00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched soaked in bleach.</v>

1056
00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:00.980
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1057
00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:01.933
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drop it.</v>

1058
00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:03.640
<v Speaker 2>You think about that soaked in bleach.</v>

1059
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot in that movie,</v>

1060
00:48:08.351 --> 00:48:10.790
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the movie that alleges that</v>

1061
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Courtney Love was involved in some way</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Kurt cobain's death.</v>

1062
00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.630
<v Speaker 2>Too Long of a movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1063
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.900
<v Speaker 2>it's too long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you watch the other movie and then</v>

1064
00:48:19.901 --> 00:48:21.910
<v Speaker 2>watch that movie each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moving to the,</v>

1065
00:48:21.911 --> 00:48:24.910
<v Speaker 2>the official one with his daughter made</v>
<v Speaker 2>Francis.</v>

1066
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:26.410
<v Speaker 2>What is it called again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Montage.</v>

1067
00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.630
<v Speaker 2>Montage of heck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the HBO one.</v>

1068
00:48:28.631 --> 00:48:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1069
00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:29.830
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1070
00:48:29.830 --> 00:48:34.150
<v Speaker 2>that seems more like closer to what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think really happened,</v>

1071
00:48:34.151 --> 00:48:37.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even see that drugs and it</v>

1072
00:48:37.181 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 2>doesn't make it look like he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>murdering.</v>

1073
00:48:39.071 --> 00:48:41.290
<v Speaker 2>It just looks like he wanted to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>himself the whole time.</v>

1074
00:48:41.291 --> 00:48:43.570
<v Speaker 2>And he put it in his lyrics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote about it.</v>

1075
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:44.550
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

1076
00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:46.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like it was going to happen.</v>

1077
00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:51.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what that movie made it</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem more like it's so hard to decipher</v>

1078
00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.950
<v Speaker 2>when someone's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they were,</v>

1079
00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:57.220
<v Speaker 2>what they actually thought and what they</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually were like.</v>

1080
00:48:57.530 --> 00:49:01.090
<v Speaker 2>Because when you put it through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>filter of what we know about how we</v>

1081
00:49:01.091 --> 00:49:04.300
<v Speaker 2>describe other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be off about something or how</v>

1082
00:49:04.301 --> 00:49:09.190
<v Speaker 2>people describe the past and they try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>idealize certain aspects of it.</v>

1083
00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Like if it was made by his daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't alive when he was doing that.</v>

1084
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.570
<v Speaker 2>So she's getting it from other people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who were there who,</v>

1085
00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's getting it from her own,</v>

1086
00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:22.750
<v Speaker 2>his own journalistic music and</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalism has a whole movies and it has</v>

1087
00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:25.240
<v Speaker 2>everything in it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty much,</v>

1088
00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:30.600
<v Speaker 2>I believe that montage of heck is like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary about Kurt cobain and soaked</v>

1089
00:49:31.151 --> 00:49:36.151
<v Speaker 2>in bleach is a documentary about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>possibility of Courtney and I'll tell</v>

1090
00:49:36.341 --> 00:49:38.350
<v Speaker 2>you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that no matter what happened,</v>

1091
00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:42.310
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievable how bad the Seattle</v>
<v Speaker 2>Police Department dropped the ball on</v>

1092
00:49:42.311 --> 00:49:46.150
<v Speaker 2>that to walk in on some guy just killed</v>
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>

1093
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:49.360
<v Speaker 2>That's worth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God only knows what I mean.</v>

1094
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:50.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know if they say during</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1095
00:49:50.951 --> 00:49:54.130
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his collection has to be worth at least</v>

1096
00:49:54.131 --> 00:49:56.380
<v Speaker 2>$100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollars or something crazy.</v>

1097
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:57.263
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a.</v>

1098
00:49:57.610 --> 00:49:59.320
<v Speaker 2>A bad police department.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1099
00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:03.100
<v Speaker 2>It was just what it was is a high</v>
<v Speaker 2>profile case in a bad police department,</v>

1100
00:50:03.101 --> 00:50:06.640
<v Speaker 2>but now imagine that they had probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>been running that police department in a</v>

1101
00:50:06.641 --> 00:50:11.110
<v Speaker 2>shitty way for as long as that guy had</v>
<v Speaker 2>been running it because as long as</v>

1102
00:50:11.111 --> 00:50:14.620
<v Speaker 2>you're a regular person that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the public's eye paying attention</v>

1103
00:50:14.621 --> 00:50:16.900
<v Speaker 2>to the case with extreme scrutiny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1104
00:50:16.901 --> 00:50:18.520
<v Speaker 2>this was in 1994,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1105
00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today it would be a different animal</v>

1106
00:50:21.131 --> 00:50:23.140
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be in social media and it would</v>

1107
00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:24.760
<v Speaker 2>blow up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it'd be gigantic.</v>

1108
00:50:24.761 --> 00:50:27.470
<v Speaker 2>It'd be way more scrutiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but back then they can kind of</v>

1109
00:50:27.471 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 2>consolidate</v>

1110
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.740
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They can compartmentalize everything and</v>

1111
00:50:30.741 --> 00:50:33.950
<v Speaker 6>they just shifted the whole thing up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They did their fucking.</v>

1112
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:36.500
<v Speaker 6>Their accounts different from the first</v>
<v Speaker 6>responders accounts,</v>

1113
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:40.160
<v Speaker 6>their description of the room deferred.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's so much of it that was off.</v>

1114
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:41.900
<v Speaker 6>It was that they are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're terrible,</v>

1115
00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:44.990
<v Speaker 6>and it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they had never done a high profile case,</v>

1116
00:50:44.991 --> 00:50:48.350
<v Speaker 6>so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're terrible police work hadn't been</v>

1117
00:50:48.351 --> 00:50:51.440
<v Speaker 6>revealed to anybody that wasn't like the</v>
<v Speaker 6>victim of it.</v>

1118
00:50:51.510 --> 00:50:52.281
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>someone who who.</v>

1119
00:50:52.281 --> 00:50:54.740
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm assuming that if they fucked up this</v>

1120
00:50:54.741 --> 00:50:56.030
<v Speaker 6>case,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he probably fucked up other ones as</v>

1121
00:50:56.031 --> 00:50:56.240
<v Speaker 6>well.</v>

1122
00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:58.100
<v Speaker 8>You're going to shit yourself when you</v>
<v Speaker 8>watch this show,</v>

<v Speaker 8>It's unbelievable.</v>

1130
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:15.700
<v Speaker 6>Amen.</v>

<v Speaker 6>mean you're a bad person.</v>

<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of cops that are fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>awesome,</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's a job that they think is very</v>

<v Speaker 6>beneficial to our society and they do it</v>
<v Speaker 6>the best they can and those people are</v>

1142
00:51:44.651 --> 00:51:46.810
<v Speaker 6>important.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some guy just stomped a kitten to death</v>

1148
00:51:57.611 --> 00:51:59.890
<v Speaker 6>on a youtube video.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I hate people.</v>

1149
00:51:59.891 --> 00:52:00.760
<v Speaker 6>I hate people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't.</v>

1150
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:02.590
<v Speaker 6>I fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to talk to anybody anymore.</v>

1151
00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:05.920
<v Speaker 6>That's ridiculous because most of us</v>
<v Speaker 6>would never do that and I think that's</v>

1152
00:52:05.921 --> 00:52:08.860
<v Speaker 6>the same thing with cops.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of fucking cops and</v>

1153
00:52:08.861 --> 00:52:11.420
<v Speaker 6>they're dealing with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 6>interactions every day,</v>

1154
00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:13.900
<v Speaker 6>every day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all day long.</v>

1155
00:52:13.901 --> 00:52:15.760
<v Speaker 6>You're dealing with people stealing</v>
<v Speaker 6>things,</v>

1156
00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.810
<v Speaker 6>people doing things to people and people</v>
<v Speaker 6>who might do things to you and they're</v>

1157
00:52:19.811 --> 00:52:22.330
<v Speaker 6>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're just overwhelmed with stress all</v>

1158
00:52:22.331 --> 00:52:22.960
<v Speaker 6>the time.</v>

1159
00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:25.290
<v Speaker 5>Especially now that the media is coming</v>
<v Speaker 5>hard.</v>

1160
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:29.320
<v Speaker 5>God Bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just spent a couple of days on a top</v>

1161
00:52:29.321 --> 00:52:32.240
<v Speaker 5>secret project,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but with cops and uh,</v>

1162
00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:35.380
<v Speaker 5>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I learned so much.</v>

1163
00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:38.830
<v Speaker 5>You learn a lot immediately about the</v>
<v Speaker 5>current perception,</v>

1164
00:52:38.831 --> 00:52:39.610
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1165
00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:41.100
<v Speaker 5>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1166
00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:44.800
<v Speaker 5>defensive and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's incredible to watch.</v>

1167
00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:47.500
<v Speaker 5>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it got me more into like I've been</v>

1168
00:52:47.501 --> 00:52:50.440
<v Speaker 5>watching a lot of these police shootings</v>
<v Speaker 5>and things.</v>

1169
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:52.690
<v Speaker 5>There's not many where,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1170
00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:56.620
<v Speaker 5>if you're going for a gun or if you have</v>
<v Speaker 5>your hand in your pocket and they're</v>

1171
00:52:56.621 --> 00:52:58.510
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take your hand out of your pocket,</v>

1172
00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:00.820
<v Speaker 5>you have to take your hand out of your</v>
<v Speaker 5>pocket.</v>

1173
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:03.160
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have any sympathy for anyone who</v>

1174
00:53:03.161 --> 00:53:04.720
<v Speaker 5>doesn't do that immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I get it.</v>

1175
00:53:04.721 --> 00:53:08.500
<v Speaker 5>There's like mental health issues and</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff and I think that's the exception</v>

1176
00:53:08.501 --> 00:53:09.660
<v Speaker 5>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And yeah,</v>

1177
00:53:09.661 --> 00:53:11.380
<v Speaker 5>sometimes it's totally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you said,</v>

1178
00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:14.290
<v Speaker 5>incident to incident,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the media really,</v>

1179
00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.990
<v Speaker 5>really messed up the cops.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

1180
00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.010
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's on edge with them right now.</v>

1181
00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:22.290
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how can you see the media mess them up</v>

1182
00:53:22.291 --> 00:53:26.340
<v Speaker 6>when there's all these videos of cops</v>
<v Speaker 6>shooting people for no doing terrible</v>

1183
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.420
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like planting evidence that God throws</v>

1184
00:53:28.421 --> 00:53:31.680
<v Speaker 4>the Taser down when he shoots that guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's running away from them.</v>

1185
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:36.710
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of really hardcore video</v>
<v Speaker 4>evidence of cops doing terrible things.</v>

1186
00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:39.240
<v Speaker 4>I think they just have to look at it in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a balanced perspective.</v>

1187
00:53:39.241 --> 00:53:41.520
<v Speaker 4>The media is not doing anything wrong by</v>
<v Speaker 4>reporting these things.</v>

1188
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:45.000
<v Speaker 4>They're making those cops accountable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think what we have to be really</v>

1189
00:53:45.001 --> 00:53:47.430
<v Speaker 4>careful as blaming all cops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly,</v>

1190
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:51.330
<v Speaker 4>and that's where it's fun to fats were</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the media makes it a little bit</v>

1191
00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:55.800
<v Speaker 4>blander than just the specific guy that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they use the word police instead of</v>

1192
00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:57.090
<v Speaker 4>officer Blah Blah Blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1193
00:53:57.091 --> 00:53:57.980
<v Speaker 4>how about this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you.</v>

1194
00:53:57.981 --> 00:54:01.710
<v Speaker 4>If you saw something and you saw a cop</v>
<v Speaker 4>like on a youtube video,</v>

1195
00:54:01.711 --> 00:54:04.350
<v Speaker 4>do something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You did something terrible.</v>

1196
00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:06.630
<v Speaker 4>When you see another cop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy,</v>

1197
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:09.690
<v Speaker 4>you're not in the same city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't even know this guy.</v>

1198
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:11.850
<v Speaker 4>This guy is just a person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>

1199
00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:15.420
<v Speaker 4>You don't make him responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that some guy did in North</v>

1200
00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:18.120
<v Speaker 4>Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but kind of people do kind of.</v>

1201
00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:21.420
<v Speaker 4>People do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go and watch some youtube video</v>

1202
00:54:21.421 --> 00:54:24.660
<v Speaker 4>of some cop doing some horrible shit and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Oakland subway and then all the</v>

1203
00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:28.110
<v Speaker 4>sudden you're in downtown La and some</v>
<v Speaker 4>cop looks at you funny like fucking pig,</v>

1204
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:30.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you hate that guy because of</v>

1205
00:54:30.451 --> 00:54:33.870
<v Speaker 4>something that someone else did that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>in his organization that he most likely</v>

1206
00:54:33.871 --> 00:54:36.510
<v Speaker 4>has never met in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if we did that with people.</v>

1207
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:40.950
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if some person did something</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up in New York and you're down in</v>

1208
00:54:40.951 --> 00:54:43.130
<v Speaker 4>Florida and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking piece of shit and this guy's</v>

1209
00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:44.160
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>

1210
00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:45.180
<v Speaker 4>I know what you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1211
00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:47.560
<v Speaker 4>You're a fucking person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a regular dude.</v>

1212
00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:48.300
<v Speaker 4>The deq and you.</v>

1213
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:50.640
<v Speaker 4>I know what that guy did in New York and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just like him.</v>

1214
00:54:50.650 --> 00:54:52.520
<v Speaker 4>Like was one cop told me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1215
00:54:52.521 --> 00:54:56.490
<v Speaker 4>like a kid ran up to him the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he's walking down a sidewalk or</v>

1216
00:54:56.510 --> 00:55:00.840
<v Speaker 4>Sarah or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>donut shop or somewhere and a little kid</v>

1217
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:02.810
<v Speaker 4>walks up and is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1218
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.950
<v Speaker 4>hi Mr. Officer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a little like,</v>

1219
00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three or four year old and some lady</v>

1220
00:55:08.221 --> 00:55:11.550
<v Speaker 4>walks over and she's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she grabs her little boy and it's like,</v>

1221
00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:15.070
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you stay away from these murders like</v>

1222
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:20.090
<v Speaker 4>that and had an in depth talk with this</v>
<v Speaker 4>police officer and it's like not only is</v>

1223
00:55:22.711 --> 00:55:25.170
<v Speaker 4>that terrible that they're being called</v>
<v Speaker 4>a murder,</v>

1224
00:55:25.171 --> 00:55:29.970
<v Speaker 4>but imagine the feeling of knowing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the next generation and that's</v>

1225
00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:31.950
<v Speaker 4>the type of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1226
00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:35.220
<v Speaker 4>things that they're being taught about</v>
<v Speaker 4>police officers right now.</v>

1227
00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:37.800
<v Speaker 4>I think that there's two ways I look at</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1228
00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:41.880
<v Speaker 4>I think in one way I look at it that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>police are necessary and we need police</v>

1229
00:55:41.881 --> 00:55:44.970
<v Speaker 4>because we have too much crime and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>have too much violence and it's just,</v>

1230
00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:50.160
<v Speaker 4>it's the way it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there are shield that protects</v>

1231
00:55:50.161 --> 00:55:54.270
<v Speaker 4>us from bad people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but another part of me looks at it and</v>

1232
00:55:54.271 --> 00:55:59.271
<v Speaker 4>says that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the dynamic of a person in control with</v>

1233
00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:04.580
<v Speaker 4>ultimate lethal power and then everyone</v>
<v Speaker 4>else around them is a bad dynamic.</v>

1234
00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:08.220
<v Speaker 4>It's not an.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the dynamic in and of itself can</v>

1235
00:56:08.221 --> 00:56:12.600
<v Speaker 4>create conflict because there's always</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be resistance to this idea of</v>

1236
00:56:12.601 --> 00:56:17.601
<v Speaker 4>someone who lives amongst you who has</v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimate power over you and who.</v>

1237
00:56:18.151 --> 00:56:22.710
<v Speaker 4>If the chips go down the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might shoot you and kill you and</v>

1238
00:56:22.711 --> 00:56:23.710
<v Speaker 4>they can away with that</v>

1239
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:27.130
<v Speaker 6>and they could say you attack them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or you were reaching for something they</v>

1240
00:56:27.131 --> 00:56:30.190
<v Speaker 6>thought was a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who knows what kind of personal vendetta</v>

1241
00:56:30.210 --> 00:56:33.600
<v Speaker 6>that they might have against you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who knows what kind of stress that they</v>

1242
00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:35.110
<v Speaker 6>might have been under when they pulled</v>
<v Speaker 6>the trigger,</v>

1243
00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:38.800
<v Speaker 6>but they could do to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're allowed to have a gun on them</v>

1244
00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.600
<v Speaker 6>and you you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even.</v>

1245
00:56:40.601 --> 00:56:42.880
<v Speaker 6>If you're a guy who's never done</v>
<v Speaker 6>anything wrong and you're walking</v>

1246
00:56:42.881 --> 00:56:44.440
<v Speaker 6>around,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to feel weird around cops</v>

1247
00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:46.960
<v Speaker 6>like you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll maybe you respect them</v>

1248
00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:48.310
<v Speaker 6>intellectually.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll say,</v>

1249
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:50.620
<v Speaker 6>thank you for your service.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I appreciate everything you guys are</v>

1250
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:51.670
<v Speaker 6>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stay safe,</v>

1251
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.750
<v Speaker 6>but in the back of your head you fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>know that if things got ugly,</v>

1252
00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:59.110
<v Speaker 6>they could shoot you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if somehow or another you got in an</v>

1253
00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:00.930
<v Speaker 6>altercation with them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1254
00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:03.460
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go towards them and you're in</v>

1255
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:06.160
<v Speaker 6>somehow or another way threatening or</v>
<v Speaker 6>physical,</v>

1256
00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.680
<v Speaker 6>they'll gun you down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know the gun,</v>

1257
00:57:08.681 --> 00:57:10.650
<v Speaker 6>your dog down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If your dog starts running at them at</v>

1258
00:57:10.651 --> 00:57:13.300
<v Speaker 6>barking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we've seen videos of that adrenaline</v>

01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:33.980
<v Speaker 4>which is an added element in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does something,</v>

1488
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:36.610
<v Speaker 5>it opens up your capillaries in your</v>
<v Speaker 5>lungs,</v>

1489
01:07:36.611 --> 01:07:38.770
<v Speaker 5>that the tea more thc gets in your</v>
<v Speaker 5>blood.</v>

1490
01:07:38.771 --> 01:07:38.930
<v Speaker 5>It</v>

1491
01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:41.420
<v Speaker 4>also has an effect of its own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1492
01:07:41.421 --> 01:07:45.380
<v Speaker 4>the nicotine in the tobacco leaf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has an effect of its own and it's</v>

1493
01:07:45.381 --> 01:07:49.130
<v Speaker 4>also unusual in the fact that that</v>
<v Speaker 4>tobacco leaf is generally not inhaled</v>

1494
01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.520
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you smoke tobacco a cigar,</v>

1495
01:07:52.521 --> 01:07:56.780
<v Speaker 4>you puff it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you don't take the big deep inhaling</v>

1496
01:07:57.350 --> 01:08:01.310
<v Speaker 4>like long filling breaths that you do</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you smoke weed.</v>

1497
01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:04.580
<v Speaker 4>So if you smoke a blunt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really kind of the only time you're</v>

1498
01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:07.430
<v Speaker 4>breathing that smoke in and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>serious irritant,</v>

1499
01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:11.320
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's real unhealthy for you to</v>

1500
01:08:11.330 --> 01:08:14.570
<v Speaker 4>smoke those tobacco leaves all the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

1501
01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:17.080
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you can't do that every day.</v>

1502
01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:20.550
<v Speaker 4>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why the Geno's little that</v>

1503
01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:25.190
<v Speaker 4>electronic cigarette blind that tastes</v>
<v Speaker 4>great and you don't have to get the</v>

1504
01:08:25.191 --> 01:08:26.450
<v Speaker 4>nicotine part of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1505

<v Speaker 4>Geno's the shit at La speed weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows what he's doing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He got pulled down from instagram was</v>

1507
01:08:31.521 --> 01:08:35.570

<v Speaker 4>account or suspended as account or</v>

1508
01:08:35.571 --> 01:08:39.910

<v Speaker 4>We all do well.</v>

1513
01:08:51.391 --> 01:08:52.790
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's wrong with weed?</v>

<v Speaker 5>instagram by making a promo that's like</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's to.</v>

1524
01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.010
<v Speaker 4>It's just a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're a company.</v>

1525
01:09:17.011 --> 01:09:18.510
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to fucking make some</v>
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>

1526
01:09:18.511 --> 01:09:20.880
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is it though that twitter,</v>

1527
01:09:20.881 --> 01:09:23.790
<v Speaker 4>you're allowed to see both holes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but instagram you can't even see</v>

1528
01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:24.840
<v Speaker 4>nipples,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1529
01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:29.880
<v Speaker 4>like twitter because of the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see all that stuff.</v>

1530
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:33.690
<v Speaker 4>There's like a more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe more of a limit in as far as her</v>

1531
01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:38.130
<v Speaker 4>kind of as they'll get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas maybe instagram because they've</v>

1532
01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.300
<v Speaker 4>been proactive in censoring people's</v>
<v Speaker 4>material,</v>

1533
01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:45.090
<v Speaker 4>censoring the images and stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're allowed to put up,</v>

1534
01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:46.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe there'll be an.</v>

1535
01:09:46.950 --> 01:09:49.260
<v Speaker 4>They could sell more of those sponsored</v>
<v Speaker 4>instagram ads.</v>

1536
01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:51.300
<v Speaker 4>That way they have a lot of those</v>
<v Speaker 4>sponsored ads.</v>

1537
01:09:51.301 --> 01:09:52.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see them all the time now in your</v>

1538
01:09:52.711 --> 01:09:55.260
<v Speaker 4>feed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can have a problem with it.</v>

1539
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:58.230
<v Speaker 4>You get shipped potholes on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do whatever you want onto think</v>

1540
01:09:58.410 --> 01:10:02.640
<v Speaker 4>sponsored ads on instagram are probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>the least offensive ads ever because</v>

1541
01:10:02.641 --> 01:10:05.850
<v Speaker 4>they take a fucking half of a second to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go through.</v>

1542
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:08.190
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas in the ad on TV is the most</v>

1543
01:10:08.191 --> 01:10:10.680
<v Speaker 4>offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're watching the walking dead and</v>

1544
01:10:10.681 --> 01:10:14.350
<v Speaker 4>they're about to get jack by zombies and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it fucking fades to black and it's,</v>

1545
01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:18.120
<v Speaker 4>don't you want your car to shine light</v>
<v Speaker 4>new</v>

1546
01:10:21.570 --> 01:10:26.570
<v Speaker 4>believeable fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fuckers have ruined the entire mood</v>

1547
01:10:26.671 --> 01:10:31.440
<v Speaker 4>of this awesome show to sell me a some</v>
<v Speaker 4>wax or whatever the fuck yourself.</v>

1548
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:34.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The artist took time to set a tone and</v>

1549
01:10:34.410 --> 01:10:36.990
<v Speaker 4>feel so much better if you watch it on</v>
<v Speaker 4>itunes.</v>

1550
01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:40.840
<v Speaker 5>Crazy to me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I remember when we were making the</v>

1551
01:10:40.841 --> 01:10:41.460
<v Speaker 5>show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1552
01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:43.980
<v Speaker 5>that burn a couple of years ago on</v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy central,</v>

1553
01:10:43.981 --> 01:10:48.130
<v Speaker 5>Jeff Ross show and I wrote and produced</v>
<v Speaker 5>it and uh,</v>

1554
01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:49.370
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've,</v>

1555
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:51.840
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was the only show that I ever watched</v>

1556
01:10:51.841 --> 01:10:56.220
<v Speaker 5>on tv because I was always doing standup</v>
<v Speaker 5>and stuff and I didn't even have a TV,</v>

1557
01:10:56.221 --> 01:10:58.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's back like this is like four or</v>

1558
01:10:58.081 --> 01:11:00.410
<v Speaker 5>five years ago anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1559
01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:05.250
<v Speaker 5>but every after every day going into</v>
<v Speaker 5>every commercial break during this</v>

1560
01:11:05.251 --> 01:11:09.210
<v Speaker 5>comedy show that's at 10:30 at night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was always a life alert commercial,</v>

1561
01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:11.980
<v Speaker 5>like straight into like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've fallen and I'm,</v>

1562
01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:13.800
<v Speaker 5>I need help.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm here.</v>

1563
01:11:13.801 --> 01:11:16.710
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like who's going to save your grandma if</v>

1564
01:11:16.711 --> 01:11:18.480
<v Speaker 5>you don't have life alert?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>

1565
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:21.750
<v Speaker 5>then it's like now back to your comedy</v>
<v Speaker 5>experience.</v>

1566
01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.360
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the worst type of stuff.</v>

1567
01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.830
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we all know that from doing standup or</v>

1568
01:11:27.831 --> 01:11:29.480
<v Speaker 6>from going to the movies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't.</v>

1569
01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:32.300
<v Speaker 6>If a movie got interrupted every 15</v>
<v Speaker 6>minutes for commercial,</v>

1570
01:11:32.301 --> 01:11:35.150
<v Speaker 6>you know how fucking pissed you would be</v>
<v Speaker 6>at the end of that movie.</v>

1571
01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:40.100
<v Speaker 6>The problem with network television is</v>
<v Speaker 6>the model they're using where you</v>

1572
01:11:40.101 --> 01:11:42.950
<v Speaker 6>interrupt shows and show these</v>
<v Speaker 6>commercials.</v>

1573
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:45.920
<v Speaker 6>It sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It sucks and you're stuck with it.</v>

1574
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:50.720
<v Speaker 6>You got to figure out a whole new way to</v>
<v Speaker 6>show ads because people are done.</v>

1575
01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:52.730
<v Speaker 6>And so the idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1576
01:11:52.731 --> 01:11:55.640
<v Speaker 6>we'll just make ads more interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll just make ads more creative.</v>

1577
01:11:55.641 --> 01:11:58.790
<v Speaker 6>And they did that to a certain extent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they still suck.</v>

1578
01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.610
<v Speaker 6>Nobody wants to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He did.</v>

1579
01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:04.250
<v Speaker 6>Even if it's the most awesome ad ever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's interrupting whether or not fucking</v>

1580
01:12:04.251 --> 01:12:05.900
<v Speaker 6>Rick is going to get jacked by the</v>
<v Speaker 6>zombies.</v>

1581
01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:07.550
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1582
01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.520
<v Speaker 6>And that's their cable that's even more</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucked up.</v>

1583
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:13.070
<v Speaker 6>He's like AMC and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1584
01:12:13.350 --> 01:12:17.210
<v Speaker 6>the independent film channel,</v>
<v Speaker 6>IFC and all these different channels or</v>

1585
01:12:17.211 --> 01:12:18.860
<v Speaker 6>cable,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can do whatever they want,</v>

1586
01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:23.450
<v Speaker 6>like they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they have to censor themselves to ensure</v>

1587
01:12:23.451 --> 01:12:27.890
<v Speaker 6>that they get the right ads.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they self sensor just to get ads.</v>

1588
01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.530
<v Speaker 6>It's not like the ABC,</v>
<v Speaker 6>CBS,</v>

1589
01:12:30.531 --> 01:12:33.410
<v Speaker 6>NBC,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those are governed by the FCC.</v>

1590
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:36.890
<v Speaker 6>And so when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you're on television,</v>

1591
01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.500
<v Speaker 6>you're not allowed to swear.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not allowed to.</v>

1592
01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.970
<v Speaker 6>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a law,</v>

1593
01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:44.660
<v Speaker 6>but on cable there's no fucking laws.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why they say shit.</v>

1594
01:12:44.661 --> 01:12:49.610
<v Speaker 6>Now Llc c asshole leads a lot of shows.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They get real close to st fuck you.</v>

1595
01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:53.780
<v Speaker 6>But they don't really say fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But they get real close and it's because</v>

1596
01:12:53.781 --> 01:12:55.550
<v Speaker 6>they're on cable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The only reason why they don't do</v>

1597
01:12:55.551 --> 01:12:58.790
<v Speaker 6>everything full nudity do ever do they</v>
<v Speaker 6>want is ads.</v>

1598
01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:01.670
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why hbo gets away with just going</v>

1599
01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:06.920
<v Speaker 6>buck wild no ads,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but to try getting people to pay for</v>

1600
01:13:06.921 --> 01:13:09.590
<v Speaker 6>shit today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if they don't produce things like</v>

1601
01:13:09.591 --> 01:13:13.160
<v Speaker 6>game of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they don't have like specials like</v>

1602
01:13:13.161 --> 01:13:15.680
<v Speaker 6>Whitney Cummings special.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't have like a lot of original</v>

1603
01:13:15.681 --> 01:13:17.930
<v Speaker 6>content,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Amy Schumer's last special,</v>

1604
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:21.200
<v Speaker 6>a lot of original content where people</v>
<v Speaker 6>are going to seek it out specifically,</v>

1605
01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:24.920
<v Speaker 6>but big time fights whenever they have a</v>
<v Speaker 6>big time fights on Hbo.</v>

1606
01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:28.370
<v Speaker 6>If it's not that it's hard getting</v>
<v Speaker 6>people to pay today.</v>

1607
01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:29.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1608
01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:30.670
<v Speaker 5>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1609
01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:35.700
<v Speaker 5>but at the same time it sort of isn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I feel like it's hard for like the</v>

1610
01:13:36.641 --> 01:13:39.610
<v Speaker 5>middle of the country I think is making</v>
<v Speaker 5>the transition now,</v>

1611
01:13:39.611 --> 01:13:44.611
<v Speaker 5>but Netflix is up to over $75 million</v>
<v Speaker 5>subscribers or something like that.</v>

1612
01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:49.810
<v Speaker 5>It's going up by millions and HBO is I</v>
<v Speaker 5>think at like 25 million households</v>

1613
01:13:52.151 --> 01:13:54.940
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's nuts.</v>

1614
01:13:55.160 --> 01:13:58.930
<v Speaker 5>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I personally I run completely off of.</v>

1615
01:13:58.931 --> 01:14:03.490
<v Speaker 5>I have netflix and I have hbo go and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is yet like if there's a sporting</v>

1616
01:14:03.491 --> 01:14:06.100
<v Speaker 5>event on the TV then I have to go to a</v>
<v Speaker 5>local,</v>

1617
01:14:06.101 --> 01:14:09.100
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bar or something or restaurant to check</v>

1618
01:14:09.101 --> 01:14:11.080
<v Speaker 5>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just how I roll.</v>

1619
01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:13.750
<v Speaker 2>You just don't want cable or satellite</v>
<v Speaker 2>or anything like that,</v>

1620
01:14:13.751 --> 01:14:14.584
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young.</v>

1621
01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:17.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't ever use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that might come on,</v>

1622
01:14:17.291 --> 01:14:20.770
<v Speaker 2>it's like a college football game or the</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC or something like that.</v>

1623
01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:22.960
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you got the UFC pass now like I,</v>

1624
01:14:22.961 --> 01:14:25.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean I cut the cable bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't looked back at all,</v>

1625
01:14:25.571 --> 01:14:27.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Hulu plus.</v>

1626
01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.830
<v Speaker 2>And you have the UFC app where it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1627
01:14:29.831 --> 01:14:32.140
<v Speaker 2>that's all you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people go in that direction.</v>

1628
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:34.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they think the future is.</v>

1629
01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:36.040
<v Speaker 2>They think the future is not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>television,</v>

1630
01:14:36.340 --> 01:14:41.340
<v Speaker 2>especially now that TV's hookup to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hcmi cables that hookup to computers</v>

1631
01:14:41.891 --> 01:14:44.440
<v Speaker 2>right away and a lot of tvs and not</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting online,</v>

1632
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:47.110
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of tvs out of the box of</v>
<v Speaker 2>online ability.</v>

1633
01:14:47.290 --> 01:14:48.970
<v Speaker 2>And so they act as a small computer.</v>

1634
01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:52.570
<v Speaker 2>So you'll just be able to go straight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like my tv by itself.</v>

1635
01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:56.380
<v Speaker 2>Go straight to youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can go to youtube like what the fuck?</v>

1636
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:59.830
<v Speaker 2>Like you through Itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do everything.</v>

1637
01:14:59.831 --> 01:15:01.900
<v Speaker 2>Itunes connect you to Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apple,</v>

1638
01:15:01.901 --> 01:15:04.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apple TV connects you to Netflix.</v>

1639
01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:06.640
<v Speaker 2>Did you get the new one yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell you that's worth the upgrade.</v>

1640
01:15:06.641 --> 01:15:11.080
<v Speaker 2>It's one of my favorite things ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just being able to go a Steve Martin and</v>

1641
01:15:11.081 --> 01:15:13.780
<v Speaker 2>it pulls up every single Steve Martin</v>
<v Speaker 2>who they talked to him.</v>

1642
01:15:13.781 --> 01:15:14.614
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just tell it,</v>

1643
01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:18.350
<v Speaker 2>so you're like a walking dead and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you click on walking down.</v>

1644
01:15:18.351 --> 01:15:22.240
<v Speaker 2>It says available on Hulu or itunes or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Netflix and it just takes you right</v>

1645
01:15:22.241 --> 01:15:23.630
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So googling.</v>

1646
01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what puff daddy as barns worth.</v>

1647
01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Do something walking dead worth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does he?</v>

1648
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:32.920
<v Speaker 2>Does he have to massage his feet at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end of a long day?</v>

1649
01:15:33.010 --> 01:15:36.010
<v Speaker 2>I totally get the lotion but okay.</v>

1650
01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:37.570
<v Speaker 2>But if it's barnes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>words choice,</v>

1651
01:15:37.710 --> 01:15:40.690
<v Speaker 2>particularly save barnes worth was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>living in Columbus News,</v>

1652
01:15:40.691 --> 01:15:43.380
<v Speaker 2>working at a tire factory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was just like.</v>

1653
01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:45.520
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden this guy came</v>
<v Speaker 2>into town and go,</v>

1654
01:15:45.521 --> 01:15:47.200
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been looking for a guy to carry my</v>

1655
01:15:47.201 --> 01:15:48.970
<v Speaker 2>umbrella.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll pay you a million dollars a year.</v>

1656
01:15:49.530 --> 01:15:52.090
<v Speaker 2>You've got to go with me to Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>France and all over the world,</v>

1657
01:15:52.091 --> 01:15:56.050
<v Speaker 2>but you'd be with me 24 hours a day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are at my beck and call and you must</v>

1658
01:15:56.051 --> 01:15:58.570
<v Speaker 2>massage my feet the end of every night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

1659
01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.380
<v Speaker 2>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a millionaire and I don't work at a</v>

1660
01:16:00.381 --> 01:16:03.400
<v Speaker 2>tire factory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinky in.</v>

1661
01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:04.640
<v Speaker 2>I think he's out.</v>

1662
01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in him.</v>

1663
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:10.640
<v Speaker 2>He's asking for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1664
01:16:11.590 --> 01:16:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I just don't understand why you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a girl.</v>

1665
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:17.280
<v Speaker 2>But because he would probably start</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking her and she would interfere in</v>

1666
01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:19.330
<v Speaker 2>his business and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if she was hot,</v>

1667
01:16:19.331 --> 01:16:21.430
<v Speaker 2>especially in they're around each other</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

1668
01:16:21.900 --> 01:16:24.400
<v Speaker 2>At a certain point in time she started</v>
<v Speaker 2>complaining about not getting a new</v>

1669
01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:25.590
<v Speaker 2>deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1670
01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.411
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys.</v>

1671
01:16:26.411 --> 01:16:28.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1672
01:16:28.180 --> 01:16:29.800
<v Speaker 2>it's just not allowed to talk and have</v>
<v Speaker 2>sex with me.</v>

1673
01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:33.080
<v Speaker 2>You're going to talk to these girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1674
01:16:33.090 --> 01:16:34.810
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're finding an acumen that you want,</v>

1675
01:16:34.811 --> 01:16:37.120
<v Speaker 2>you'd want as a robot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1676
01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.580
<v Speaker 2>you want a replicant like blade runner</v>
<v Speaker 2>style,</v>

1677
01:16:39.610 --> 01:16:41.740
<v Speaker 2>which we're going to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to happen.</v>

1678
01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:45.600
<v Speaker 2>It's 20 years away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're 20 years away from going over</v>

1679
01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:47.050
<v Speaker 2>someone's house and they have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>replicant.</v>

1680
01:16:47.610 --> 01:16:50.560
<v Speaker 2>You're going to go over your buddy's</v>
<v Speaker 2>house and he's going to have a Chinese</v>

1681
01:16:50.561 --> 01:16:54.140
<v Speaker 2>lady with giant ridiculous tits and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>waste.</v>

1682
01:16:54.141 --> 01:16:58.240
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't seem to be possible for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>size of her tits and ass that's out of</v>

1683
01:16:58.241 --> 01:17:01.270
<v Speaker 2>this world and she's going to be cleaned</v>
<v Speaker 2>it up and you're not going to be sure if</v>

1684
01:17:01.271 --> 01:17:04.930
<v Speaker 2>she's really not going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1685
01:17:05.230 --> 01:17:07.150
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a person?</v>

1686
01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:10.160
<v Speaker 2>Is this a person or is that a replicant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he'll pull you into</v>

1687
01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.140
<v Speaker 4>the fucking kitchen and they'll explain</v>
<v Speaker 4>it to you.</v>

1688
01:17:12.710 --> 01:17:15.460
<v Speaker 5>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think when we get close to that,</v>

1689
01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:19.670
<v Speaker 5>that they're going to first just let</v>
<v Speaker 5>them out into the world and try to fool</v>

1690
01:17:19.671 --> 01:17:22.190
<v Speaker 5>everybody to see if they can do it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a Beta test?</v>

1691
01:17:22.260 --> 01:17:23.460
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're too expensive,</v>

1692
01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.540
<v Speaker 4>but they're tracking them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like hardcore.</v>

1693
01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:26.670
<v Speaker 4>I think we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1694
01:17:26.730 --> 01:17:28.470
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we'll know when they develop</v>

1695
01:17:28.471 --> 01:17:31.290
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they get one to the point where</v>

1696
01:17:31.291 --> 01:17:34.530
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like a person we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>know and it's going to be terrifying</v>

1697
01:17:35.130 --> 01:17:39.900
<v Speaker 4>when they sit that one down on</v>
<v Speaker 4>television and we have a robot that</v>

1698
01:17:39.901 --> 01:17:43.140
<v Speaker 4>adjusts his clothes and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what would you like to know?</v>

1699
01:17:43.230 --> 01:17:45.630
<v Speaker 4>You're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

1700
01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:49.720
<v Speaker 4>what have we done?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what the fuck have we done and how</v>

1701
01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:51.660
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do we know about what this thing</v>

1702
01:17:51.661 --> 01:17:54.330
<v Speaker 4>has done to protect itself?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do we know about what this thing</v>

1703
01:17:54.331 --> 01:17:57.630
<v Speaker 4>has done to ensure that the idea is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has,</v>

1704
01:17:57.631 --> 01:18:01.290
<v Speaker 4>will continue and in some other form and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most important question,</v>

1705
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:03.720
<v Speaker 4>how do you fuck it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1706
01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:06.930
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna be able to fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you would a normal woman if they're</v>

1707
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:08.610
<v Speaker 4>going to be able to have artificial</v>
<v Speaker 4>skin.</v>

1708
01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:11.670
<v Speaker 4>They have artificial skin that they've</v>
<v Speaker 4>already developed.</v>

1709
01:18:12.210 --> 01:18:15.690
<v Speaker 4>So they've been able to develop skin in</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1710
01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.360
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

1711
01:18:17.410 --> 01:18:21.270
<v Speaker 4>like some sort of an experiment where</v>
<v Speaker 4>they recreated a woman's bladder,</v>

1712
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:24.210
<v Speaker 4>they use stem cells and they recreated</v>
<v Speaker 4>her bladder.</v>

1713
01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:28.620
<v Speaker 4>They created a new bladder and then they</v>
<v Speaker 4>put it back into her body and it acts as</v>

1714
01:18:28.621 --> 01:18:30.600
<v Speaker 4>a functioning bladder like they're going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1715
01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:33.210
<v Speaker 4>they're going to be able to develop</v>
<v Speaker 4>artificial skin.</v>

1716
01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:37.220
<v Speaker 5>So when these are lab created skin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when these robots that you can fuck</v>

1717
01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:42.140
<v Speaker 5>become like easily accessible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how much longer until women go extinct.</v>

1718
01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:47.610
<v Speaker 4>How much longer until you go over your</v>
<v Speaker 4>ex's house.</v>

1719
01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:51.660
<v Speaker 4>Your ex is like 60 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's dressed like the wife on three's</v>

1735
01:19:40.911 --> 01:19:42.530
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Punch.</v>

1738
01:19:48.471 --> 01:19:51.920
<v Speaker 5>comment out of it or if it would just</v>
<v Speaker 5>reuse the comfort tiers later?</v>

<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it was that advanced where it is</v>

<v Speaker 5>Please put it in my palm.</v>

1744
01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:11.430
<v Speaker 4>Oversensitive people right now will be</v>
<v Speaker 4>tuning in and going,</v>

1745
01:20:11.431 --> 01:20:15.090
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe Tony Hinchcliffe is</v>

1746
01:20:15.091 --> 01:20:19.920
<v Speaker 4>saying that women would go extinct if</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone made a perfect artificial woman</v>

1747
01:20:19.921 --> 01:20:22.500
<v Speaker 4>that did everything that a man wants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No nagging.</v>

1748
01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:26.850
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you want the nagging right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want a real woman because all women</v>

1749
01:20:26.851 --> 01:20:31.851
<v Speaker 4>don't have a mute button badge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Mute and clean.</v>

1750
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:34.680
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be back in a couple hours by bed.</v>

1751
01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.900
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about all the negative aspects of</v>

1752
01:20:36.901 --> 01:20:37.590
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1753
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:41.070
<v Speaker 4>Jealousy and anger and that lady fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're homicidal.</v>

1754
01:20:41.071 --> 01:20:43.140
<v Speaker 4>Rage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smashing into that dude's car and then</v>

1755
01:20:43.141 --> 01:20:45.990
<v Speaker 4>break those windows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about all this negative aspects of</v>

1756
01:20:45.991 --> 01:20:47.100
<v Speaker 4>being a person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1757
01:20:47.101 --> 01:20:50.190
<v Speaker 4>think of all the positive aspects of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>great things people can do when they're</v>

1758
01:20:50.191 --> 01:20:53.160
<v Speaker 4>wonderful and they're nice and</v>
<v Speaker 4>supportive and loving and friendly and</v>

1759
01:20:53.161 --> 01:20:56.700
<v Speaker 4>caressing and affectionate and just get</v>
<v Speaker 4>rid of the bad stuff and then you have</v>

1760
01:20:56.701 --> 01:20:57.540
<v Speaker 4>this perfect person.</v>

1761
01:20:57.570 --> 01:21:01.070
<v Speaker 4>Maybe Barnes worth is a robot and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>just don't know anybody.</v>

1762
01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:03.990
<v Speaker 4>Maybe P diddy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just a man of the possible that</v>

1763
01:21:03.991 --> 01:21:07.820
<v Speaker 4>there's something super shady about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy that holds an umbrella for a living.</v>

1764
01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:10.500
<v Speaker 4>They've always existed though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1765
01:21:10.501 --> 01:21:13.710
<v Speaker 4>that's the Butler and fucking Batman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He never wants to kick ass.</v>

1766
01:21:13.740 --> 01:21:14.820
<v Speaker 4>He never is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

1767
01:21:14.821 --> 01:21:16.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm tired of this bullshit,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Once you have some dude who stands there</v>

1814
01:23:34.991 --> 01:23:37.570
<v Speaker 7>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like a night in front of a castle with</v>

<v Speaker 5>that I saw him,</v>

1938
01:29:16.561 --> 01:29:19.620
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was hosting that night and they were</v>

1939
01:29:19.621 --> 01:29:22.980
<v Speaker 5>making like some little promo video for</v>
<v Speaker 5>the comedy store and it was the first</v>

1940
01:29:22.981 --> 01:29:26.780
<v Speaker 5>time that I ever saw him on stage and I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1941
01:29:26.910 --> 01:29:29.310
<v Speaker 5>they asked me to interview,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1942
01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:32.400
<v Speaker 5>just walk around and explain how potluck</v>
<v Speaker 5>works because they wanted to make a</v>

1943
01:29:32.401 --> 01:29:33.750
<v Speaker 5>little two minute video for the comedy.</v>

1944
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:35.460
<v Speaker 5>So I think it's still on their website</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually.</v>

1945
01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:39.440
<v Speaker 5>And I talked to him and I met him that</v>
<v Speaker 5>night and he goes,</v>

1946
01:29:39.540 --> 01:29:40.650
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you do for work?</v>

1947
01:29:40.651 --> 01:29:44.150
<v Speaker 5>He has,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a manager at a Mcdonald's a like an</v>

1948
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:48.480
<v Speaker 5>hour outside of La San.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that something like you have such an</v>

1949
01:29:48.481 --> 01:29:53.481
<v Speaker 5>interesting look and you sound so funny</v>
<v Speaker 5>that if you get good at this you are</v>

1950
01:29:54.271 --> 01:29:59.271
<v Speaker 5>going to be on fucking stoppable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm starting to see this fucking</v>

1951
01:30:00.241 --> 01:30:03.120
<v Speaker 5>like when the car starts to turn over</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's like,</v>

1952
01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:04.830
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

1953
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:07.710
<v Speaker 5>there's a fucking engine in here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm seeing it every Monday.</v>

1954
01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:10.290
<v Speaker 5>And like I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there's nothing more fun than</v>

1955
01:30:10.291 --> 01:30:12.570
<v Speaker 5>watching people that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that like,</v>

1956
01:30:12.571 --> 01:30:15.960
<v Speaker 5>you're in you root for just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>start ripping it.</v>

1957
01:30:16.410 --> 01:30:18.450
<v Speaker 5>And he's doing it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so cool.</v>

1958
01:30:18.451 --> 01:30:21.030
<v Speaker 5>Especially since he has such a defined</v>
<v Speaker 5>style.</v>

1959
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:22.230
<v Speaker 5>Like he literally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1960
01:30:22.231 --> 01:30:24.480
<v Speaker 5>they say it takes 10 years to find your</v>
<v Speaker 5>voice,</v>

1961
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:27.840
<v Speaker 5>but he has his voice like literally it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>going to.</v>

1962
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:30.150
<v Speaker 5>It is as long as he keeps doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And why?</v>

1963
01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:32.400
<v Speaker 5>No speech therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't think so.</v>

1964
01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:32.850
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>

1965
01:30:32.850 --> 01:30:34.680
<v Speaker 5>Oh no way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I say you fix that.</v>

1966
01:30:34.681 --> 01:30:36.180
<v Speaker 5>You're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at that.</v>

1967
01:30:36.181 --> 01:30:39.060
<v Speaker 5>This was like literally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think his first time at the comedy</v>

1968
01:30:39.061 --> 01:30:42.210
<v Speaker 5>store and he's bombing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it's probably really quick.</v>

1969
01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:42.870
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's,</v>

1970
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:45.300
<v Speaker 5>we don't want to watch them bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no reason.</v>

1971
01:30:45.330 --> 01:30:49.230
<v Speaker 5>There's no reason to watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But this was his first time and I go,</v>

1972
01:30:49.231 --> 01:30:51.060

1974
01:30:52.670 --> 01:30:53.820
<v Speaker 5>we worked with the store.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1975
01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:55.590
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's worked there for and he's been the</v>

<v Speaker 5>producer of kill Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this guy fucking hustles and he</v>

<v Speaker 5>He's gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1979
01:31:03.031 --> 01:31:06.030

1980
01:31:06.031 --> 01:31:09.030
<v Speaker 5>because like he used to like start</v>
<v Speaker 5>arguments with people and just talk</v>

1981
01:31:09.031 --> 01:31:10.290
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

<v Speaker 5>like so many others where you get to</v>

1983
01:31:12.661 --> 01:31:17.540

<v Speaker 5>Some for some people doing standup</v>

1984
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:19.890
<v Speaker 5>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden you're in a social</v>

1985

<v Speaker 5>setting for the first time ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1986
01:31:22.141 --> 01:31:22.974

<v Speaker 5>it can be,</v>

1987
01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.560
<v Speaker 5>it can be a real bad scene.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1988
01:31:25.561 --> 01:31:27.540
<v Speaker 5>when you're struggling and you're young</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you,</v>

1989
01:31:27.541 --> 01:31:28.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>like over a year.</v>

1992
01:31:34.861 --> 01:31:38.850
<v Speaker 5>He lived in his car one time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian Moses on the way to the ice house.</v>

1993
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:40.560
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had to pee.</v>

1994
01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:44.190
<v Speaker 5>I was in the car for that and it was the</v>
<v Speaker 5>most unbelievable thing ever.</v>

1995
01:31:44.191 --> 01:31:48.390
<v Speaker 5>So Josh is driving in the car that he</v>
<v Speaker 5>sleeps in his house.</v>

1996
01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:50.700
<v Speaker 5>We're going to the ice house for one of</v>
<v Speaker 5>these Friday night shows.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm sitting shotgun and our good pal</v>
<v Speaker 5>Brian Moses host a roast battle is</v>

1998

<v Speaker 5>as soon as we're.</v>

<v Speaker 10>It's like we're almost.</v>
<v Speaker 10>There were like five minutes away.</v>

2000
01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:04.930
<v Speaker 10>It's like a 25 minute drive,</v>
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

2001
01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.900
<v Speaker 10>All of a sudden Moses is like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>Oh fuck man,</v>

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:22.680
<v Speaker 10>And they were like this out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Moses doesn't mind me telling this</v>

2007
01:32:25.690 --> 01:32:26.770
<v Speaker 10>story.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It's funny.</v>

<v Speaker 10>you're cool.</v>

2010
01:32:30.821 --> 01:32:32.780
<v Speaker 10>You can handle this.</v>
<v Speaker 10>But.</v>

2011
01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:35.430
<v Speaker 10>And what?</v>
<v Speaker 10>But what's unbelievable about this story</v>

2012
01:32:35.431 --> 01:32:39.790
<v Speaker 10>is who cares that he peed himself?</v>
<v Speaker 10>What are the odds that a guy peed</v>

2013
01:32:39.791 --> 01:32:43.960
<v Speaker 10>himself that never pays himself ever?</v>
<v Speaker 10>What are the odds that he peed himself</v>

2014
01:32:44.110 --> 01:32:46.740
<v Speaker 10>in the back seat of where this kid's</v>
<v Speaker 10>sleep?</v>

2015
01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:49.990
<v Speaker 10>Now he has to.</v>
<v Speaker 10>No matter where he's staying,</v>

2016
01:32:49.991 --> 01:32:52.650
<v Speaker 10>has to put his feet on that end of the</v>
<v Speaker 10>backseat.</v>

2017
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:57.510
<v Speaker 10>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 10>by the way,</v>

2018
01:32:58.770 --> 01:33:01.230
<v Speaker 10>just giving a few minutes of warning.</v>
<v Speaker 10>We get a gun</v>

2019
01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:05.560
<v Speaker 10>so quick.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Whoever,</v>

2020
01:33:05.890 --> 01:33:09.010
<v Speaker 10>God,</v>
<v Speaker 10>how great this story really was on the</v>

2021
01:33:09.010 --> 01:33:09.340
<v Speaker 10>Ice House,</v>
<v Speaker 10>right?</v>

2022
01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.670
<v Speaker 10>Because they came right to the ice house</v>
<v Speaker 10>and then Brian just says,</v>

2023
01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:13.210
<v Speaker 10>I just had to go.</v>
<v Speaker 10>It just came out of nowhere.</v>

2024
01:33:13.211 --> 01:33:16.720
<v Speaker 10>I just had to go and you could tell it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Even he as it was happening,</v>

2025
01:33:16.721 --> 01:33:17.440
<v Speaker 10>like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 10>yeah,</v>

2026
01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:20.350
<v Speaker 10>this never happens.</v>
<v Speaker 10>I don't know what the fuck's going on.</v>

2027
01:33:20.660 --> 01:33:21.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

2028
01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:23.120
<v Speaker 4>It happens when people pooped</v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

2029
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:25.400
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That deck almost makes more sense.</v>

2030
01:33:25.401 --> 01:33:27.020
<v Speaker 4>Like sometimes people get diarrhea and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

2031
01:33:27.021 --> 01:33:29.570
<v Speaker 4>oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I remember just a couple of weeks</v>

2032
01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:31.310
<v Speaker 4>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I barely made it to the toilet.</v>

2033
01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:36.170
<v Speaker 4>I had these insane pains in my lower</v>
<v Speaker 4>stomach and I was climbing.</v>

2034
01:33:36.171 --> 01:33:38.060
<v Speaker 4>I was going upstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I started to have them,</v>

2035
01:33:38.061 --> 01:33:39.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

2036
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:44.350
<v Speaker 4>this is like a real battle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was squeezing right now.</v>

2037
01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:46.400
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't talk to anybody in my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't talk,</v>

2038
01:33:46.401 --> 01:33:47.234
<v Speaker 4>can't talk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

2039
01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:51.920
<v Speaker 4>and I had to push past my kids and get</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the toilet and I shut the door.</v>

2040
01:33:51.921 --> 01:33:52.581
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Daddy's got to go.</v>

2041
01:33:52.581 --> 01:33:54.740
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be right out in the Mr. asking me</v>

2042
01:33:54.741 --> 01:33:56.510
<v Speaker 4>questions and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I sit down.</v>

2043
01:33:56.511 --> 01:34:00.440
<v Speaker 4>I had a lock that door because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>start working the knob five year old</v>

2044
01:34:00.441 --> 01:34:02.020
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>give a fuck if you have to go to that.</v>

2045
01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:03.590
<v Speaker 4>This isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't register with them.</v>

2046
01:34:03.591 --> 01:34:05.180
<v Speaker 4>Like Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've talked to you about some stuff like</v>

2047
01:34:05.181 --> 01:34:06.014
<v Speaker 4>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>

2048
01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:10.220
<v Speaker 4>And just were</v>
<v Speaker 4>rushed out of me like a hoard of</v>

2049

<v Speaker 4>Tony to meet now has a different diet.</v>

2054
01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:32.930
<v Speaker 4>I've been eating meat for a few weeks</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I am pumped about it.</v>

2055
01:34:32.931 --> 01:34:36.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm excited about it at a whole chicken</v>

<v Speaker 4>What pushed you over the top?</v>

2060
01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:48.470
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>besides the mocking of everyone around</v>

2061
01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:50.253
<v Speaker 4>it was</v>

2062
01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:55.360
<v Speaker 10>I wanted to have friends again.</v>
<v Speaker 10>My Dad,</v>

2063
01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:00.260
<v Speaker 5>I haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't get to go back to youngstown</v>

2064
01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:02.780
<v Speaker 5>where I'm from for a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've just been,</v>

2068
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:09.290
<v Speaker 5>I went into my dad's restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He owns a great Italian restaurant where</v>

2069
01:35:09.291 --> 01:35:12.380
<v Speaker 5>I'm from in Youngstown and a cable to</v>

01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:19.170
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've talked about other stuff about in</v>

2072
01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:20.330
<v Speaker 5>another podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Applebee's.</v>

2077
01:35:27.591 --> 01:35:31.040

2078
01:35:31.041 --> 01:35:32.120
<v Speaker 5>he.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm going back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to make something like that.</v>

2081
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:36.650
<v Speaker 5>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2082

2084
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:42.770
<v Speaker 5>And the look he gave me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it was like,</v>

2085

<v Speaker 5>I could see it was like emperor</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2089
01:35:54.501 --> 01:35:58.460
<v Speaker 5>he stopped and looked at me confused and</v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of turned his head like a dog.</v>

2090
01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:01.220
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>My Dad's like a complete perfect hybrid</v>

2093
01:36:07.671 --> 01:36:12.650
<v Speaker 5>of Sebastian and dice.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's my dad fleet hybrid of those two</v>

2094
01:36:12.651 --> 01:36:13.880
<v Speaker 5>guys.</v>

2096
01:36:18.150 --> 01:36:20.940

<v Speaker 7>he waited until we got back in the day.</v>

2097
01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:21.660
<v Speaker 7>Got Back.</v>

2098
01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:24.990
<v Speaker 5>Well nobody out of all the years out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything it's been,</v>

2099
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:26.790
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like five or six years of</v>

2100
01:36:26.791 --> 01:36:28.230
<v Speaker 5>vegetarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>veganism.</v>

2101
01:36:28.231 --> 01:36:31.680
<v Speaker 5>But I eat fish so it's like pescatarian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't eat dairy so it's weird.</v>

2102
01:36:32.010 --> 01:36:34.830
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody's busted my balls more about it</v>

2103
01:36:34.831 --> 01:36:38.520
<v Speaker 5>than Brian Red band here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And our very good friend Pete,</v>

2104
01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:41.160
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because I hang out with them all the</v>

2105
01:36:41.161 --> 01:36:44.370
<v Speaker 5>time and so something happened but blah</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah.</v>

2106
01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:47.430
<v Speaker 5>And I just sorta like after the few days</v>
<v Speaker 5>of being back and being like,</v>

2107
01:36:47.431 --> 01:36:51.390
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how good my dad's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean the seafood pasta that he made</v>

2108
01:36:51.391 --> 01:36:54.900
<v Speaker 5>for me was the most mind bending seafood</v>
<v Speaker 5>pasta I've ever had in my life.</v>

2109
01:36:54.901 --> 01:36:58.100
<v Speaker 5>But there was something about the look</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he gave me in which it's like,</v>

2110
01:36:58.110 --> 01:36:59.850
<v Speaker 5>do you have any idea what you're missing</v>
<v Speaker 5>out on?</v>

2111
01:36:59.851 --> 01:37:02.000
<v Speaker 5>You fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll make you the seafood.</v>

2112
01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:04.130
<v Speaker 7>Positive face looks fuller.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2113
01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:05.900
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>His body looks forward to.</v>

2114
01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:09.480
<v Speaker 7>It looks like you've,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you've stopped this growth stunt.</v>

2115
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:14.190
<v Speaker 7>Like you had to maybe like a bend in a</v>
<v Speaker 7>garden hose and just opened it up and</v>

2116
01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:16.450
<v Speaker 7>niosh time you seen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But lately.</v>

2117
01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:19.770
<v Speaker 7>But he's got a new boy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You got a little bit you to show me your</v>

2118
01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:23.450
<v Speaker 7>book.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You do seem like.</v>

2119
01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:26.330
<v Speaker 7>Are you really standing up to show your</v>
<v Speaker 7>but don't listen to him.</v>

2120
01:37:26.670 --> 01:37:30.930
<v Speaker 7>Was looking to see if I had a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I wasn't showing you.</v>

2121
01:37:30.931 --> 01:37:33.090
<v Speaker 7>I was looking to see if I have.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Could you check?</v>

2122
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:35.730
<v Speaker 7>How can you be sure?</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a terrible angle that there's no</v>

2123
01:37:35.731 --> 01:37:40.500
<v Speaker 7>way to be sure to see that little poof.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You lifting weights or something?</v>

2124
01:37:40.530 --> 01:37:44.110
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Squats now know squat.</v>

2125
01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:46.730
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just have a couple of dumbbells.</v>

2126
01:37:46.731 --> 01:37:49.870
<v Speaker 5>I just work shoulders and press and</v>
<v Speaker 5>curl.</v>

2127
01:37:49.870 --> 01:37:50.000
<v Speaker 5>You should</v>

2128
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.250
<v Speaker 7>go to a trainer.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2129
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:55.040
<v Speaker 7>I should be a funny show.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You and Brian Losing weight and gaining</v>

2130
01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 7>weight both</v>

2131
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.990
<v Speaker 4>of you together and then now and call it</v>
<v Speaker 4>in and out.</v>

2132
01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:01.750
<v Speaker 4>What's creating every team should do</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2133
01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:07.230
<v Speaker 4>It helps muscles recover and it helps</v>
<v Speaker 4>them grow and it helps them retain water</v>

2134
01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:09.300
<v Speaker 4>in some people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you take too much of it,</v>

2135
01:38:09.301 --> 01:38:11.590
<v Speaker 4>it gives you kind of like a puffy look</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause you,</v>

2136
01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:13.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will retain a little bit more water</v>

2137
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:16.440
<v Speaker 4>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not allowed to talk out of school,</v>

2138
01:38:16.441 --> 01:38:18.450
<v Speaker 4>but it's a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely been shown to be</v>

2139
01:38:18.451 --> 01:38:20.620
<v Speaker 4>beneficial for gaining muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2140
01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:23.280
<v Speaker 4>And it's also something that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>measure.</v>

2141
01:38:23.281 --> 01:38:26.570
<v Speaker 4>If you are overtrained you can have</v>
<v Speaker 4>cree,</v>

2142
01:38:26.850 --> 01:38:29.490
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called creatinine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a little bit of a different</v>

2143
01:38:29.491 --> 01:38:30.510
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a,</v>

2144
01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:33.000
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's something that shows the damage of</v>

2145
01:38:33.001 --> 01:38:35.430
<v Speaker 4>your muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like if you're like grossly</v>

2146
01:38:35.431 --> 01:38:37.650
<v Speaker 4>overtrained,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might have really high levels of</v>

2147
01:38:37.651 --> 01:38:40.530
<v Speaker 4>this stuff and then like I know if a guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a guy,</v>

2148
01:38:40.531 --> 01:38:42.810
<v Speaker 4>I think it was pulled out of a fight</v>
<v Speaker 4>because of it,</v>

2149
01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:47.160
<v Speaker 4>like they tested him and he tested</v>
<v Speaker 4>really high for this Korea to stuff.</v>

2150
01:38:48.250 --> 01:38:51.600
<v Speaker 4>I want to say tim can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's harder for me to remember,</v>

2151
01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:54.990
<v Speaker 4>but there's another organization outside</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the UFC a long time ago.</v>

2152
01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:57.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that.</v>

2153
01:38:57.790 --> 01:39:02.790
<v Speaker 4>But a creatine works illegal to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's your energy like five hour energy</v>

2154
01:39:04.111 --> 01:39:07.650
<v Speaker 4>before doing your work for you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I know I'm so paranoid with my</v>

2155
01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:10.110
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] this thing like tracks your</v>
<v Speaker 4>heartbeat all times.</v>

2156
01:39:10.111 --> 01:39:11.970
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well the milligrams caffeine,</v>

2157
01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:15.630
<v Speaker 4>if you look at a five hour energy drink,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's only a little bit over 200</v>

2158
01:39:15.631 --> 01:39:17.610
<v Speaker 4>milligrams caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's vitamin B 12,</v>

2159
01:39:17.611 --> 01:39:19.500
<v Speaker 4>which is healthy for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get some uh,</v>

2160
01:39:19.770 --> 01:39:21.750
<v Speaker 4>some stimulation from that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of vitamin B,</v>

2161
01:39:21.751 --> 01:39:24.090
<v Speaker 4>12 about a vitamin B,</v>
<v Speaker 4>12 is water soluble.</v>

2162
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:26.160
<v Speaker 4>It goes right out of your system and in</v>
<v Speaker 4>and out.</v>

2164
01:39:29.491 --> 01:39:31.320
<v Speaker 4>period of time to have any negative</v>
<v Speaker 4>effects.</v>

2165
01:39:31.530 --> 01:39:36.370
<v Speaker 4>So like using it as a stimulant or a</v>
<v Speaker 4>potential energy source like that in a</v>

2166
01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:38.360
<v Speaker 4>five hour energy drinks fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not bad for you.</v>

2167
01:39:38.361 --> 01:39:40.020
<v Speaker 4>The only thing with the five hour</v>
<v Speaker 4>energies,</v>

2275
01:44:37.601 --> 01:44:38.381
<v Speaker 4>little bit of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2276
01:44:38.381 --> 01:44:41.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to watch this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like having a great time having all this</v>

2277
01:44:41.981 --> 01:44:45.400
<v Speaker 4>talent and then turn into a junkie and</v>
<v Speaker 4>fall apart and an alcoholic.</v>

2278
01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:47.710
<v Speaker 4>It just makes me sad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2279
01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:49.300
<v Speaker 5>it's depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2280
01:44:49.301 --> 01:44:52.820
<v Speaker 5>the main thing is that she had</v>
<v Speaker 5>dysmorphia and she was totally believe</v>

2281
01:44:52.821 --> 01:44:55.630
<v Speaker 5>that the entire time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's probably basically what sorta</v>

2282
01:44:55.631 --> 01:44:58.420
<v Speaker 5>killed there is like her body was just</v>
<v Speaker 5>uncomplete shut down.</v>

2283
01:44:58.421 --> 01:44:59.710
<v Speaker 5>When you get to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

01:44:59.711 --> 01:45:02.990
<v Speaker 5>her face started swelling up like</v>

2285
01:45:02.991 --> 01:45:06.540

<v Speaker 5>And towards the end she had bulimia.</v>

2286
01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:09.010
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she had it the whole time and it was</v>

2287
01:45:09.011 --> 01:45:11.110
<v Speaker 5>like a huge part of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was always.</v>

2288
01:45:11.111 --> 01:45:13.180
<v Speaker 5>She would always just throw up</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything that she had,</v>

<v Speaker 7>well heroin has some sort of connection</v>

2372
01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:43.860
<v Speaker 7>to like this deep moody pain that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 7>of blues singers and a lot of jazz</v>

01:49:44.291 --> 01:49:48.360
<v Speaker 7>musicians and a lot of a lot of and roll</v>
<v Speaker 7>stars figured</v>

2374
01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:53.360
<v Speaker 6>out a way to tap into and find some</v>
<v Speaker 6>resource of creativity in that realm is</v>

2375
01:49:53.891 --> 01:49:56.380
<v Speaker 6>just so destructive to your body while</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're there.</v>

2376
01:49:56.410 --> 01:49:57.850
<v Speaker 6>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so devastating.</v>

2377
01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:00.610
<v Speaker 6>The fact that you're a junkie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not taking care of your health,</v>

2378
01:50:00.611 --> 01:50:04.000
<v Speaker 6>and it's not even necessarily even</v>
<v Speaker 6>primarily the effects of heroin,</v>

2379
01:50:04.001 --> 01:50:06.700
<v Speaker 6>but the side effects of the lifestyle of</v>
<v Speaker 6>being a junkie,</v>

2380
01:50:06.701 --> 01:50:09.470
<v Speaker 6>that the lack of sleep and the terrible</v>
<v Speaker 6>life and the,</v>

2381
01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:13.150
<v Speaker 6>the terrible food and just the chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2382
01:50:13.151 --> 01:50:15.600
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what cripples them all,</v>

2383
01:50:15.650 --> 01:50:17.980
<v Speaker 6>crushes them all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's people that are like functional</v>

2384
01:50:17.981 --> 01:50:21.790
<v Speaker 6>junkies that exist for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They can live for a long time.</v>

2385
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.240
<v Speaker 6>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's like even being an alcoholic,</v>

2386
01:50:25.241 --> 01:50:28.990
<v Speaker 6>it's not just the alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's also the lifestyle that you live</v>

2387
01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:31.000
<v Speaker 6>this unhealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>lack of sleep,</v>

2388
01:50:31.001 --> 01:50:32.740
<v Speaker 6>lack of recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2389
01:50:32.741 --> 01:50:35.200

<v Speaker 6>It's not just the alcohol,</v>

2390
01:50:35.201 --> 01:50:38.580

<v Speaker 6>Those decisions to drink that much booze</v>

<v Speaker 6>Drink that much booze and also eat like</v>

2398
01:50:51.261 --> 01:50:56.020
<v Speaker 6>an incredibly nutrient rich organic diet</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you got to go to Erewhon and get</v>

2399
01:50:56.021 --> 01:50:57.450
<v Speaker 6>fucking salad bar.</v>

2400
01:50:57.500 --> 01:50:59.410
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to do that or a drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2401
01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:03.700
<v Speaker 6>I think it all goes bad and I think with</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lot of these junkies they just give in</v>

2402
01:51:03.710 --> 01:51:08.680
<v Speaker 6>to the fucking sound that given to the</v>
<v Speaker 6>siren to given to the song of that beast</v>

2403
01:51:08.710 --> 01:51:10.530
<v Speaker 6>to takes it into its veins.</v>

2404
01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:17.880
<v Speaker 5>Then you sing a song like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's another thing with amy is like,</v>

2405
01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:22.971
<v Speaker 5>you also see that she had this amazing</v>
<v Speaker 5>voice to her whole growing up and she</v>

2406
01:51:23.221 --> 01:51:26.100
<v Speaker 5>wanted to be a musician and she was</v>
<v Speaker 5>doing good and she was doing good and</v>

2407
01:51:26.101 --> 01:51:27.090
<v Speaker 5>good and good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>

2408
01:51:27.091 --> 01:51:30.900
<v Speaker 5>And then she,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then she started heroin and then it's</v>

2409
01:51:30.901 --> 01:51:32.550
<v Speaker 5>like immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2410
01:51:32.551 --> 01:51:34.320
<v Speaker 5>even the documentary shows and it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2411
01:51:34.321 --> 01:51:35.760
<v Speaker 5>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she started doing heroin.</v>

2412
01:51:35.761 --> 01:51:39.810
<v Speaker 5>All of a sudden it goes from these tiny</v>
<v Speaker 5>little jazz clubs to like amphitheaters</v>

2413
01:51:39.811 --> 01:51:41.190
<v Speaker 5>to hold new songs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2414
01:51:41.191 --> 01:51:42.670
<v Speaker 5>Rehab the album,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2415
01:51:42.690 --> 01:51:47.430
<v Speaker 5>back back to black or back in black,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is just all hits like out of this</v>

2416
01:51:47.431 --> 01:51:50.700
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it made me wonder.</v>

2417
01:51:50.701 --> 01:51:51.570
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

2418
01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:56.040
<v Speaker 5>I just wish there was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a like some kind of a,</v>

2419
01:51:57.060 --> 01:52:00.720
<v Speaker 5>what's the word?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like fake system or a prototype or</v>

2420
01:52:00.721 --> 01:52:01.830
<v Speaker 5>something that you could try.</v>

2421
01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:04.940
<v Speaker 5>That would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what would I write if I was on heroin?</v>

2422
01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:09.660
<v Speaker 5>You get to peak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We shouldn't try to open up the present.</v>

2423
01:52:09.690 --> 01:52:13.440
<v Speaker 5>We should all get together like a</v>
<v Speaker 5>professional issue in any drugs with you</v>

2424
01:52:16.090 --> 01:52:19.630
<v Speaker 5>do some heroin ride the white snake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever broken pot with you is probably</v>

2425
01:52:20.130 --> 01:52:24.360
<v Speaker 5>45 percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why would anybody want to do heroin with</v>

2426
01:52:24.361 --> 01:52:27.120
<v Speaker 5>you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what do you understand?</v>

2427
01:52:27.450 --> 01:52:31.200
<v Speaker 5>I always love that you never come to any</v>
<v Speaker 5>of those mushroom trips with us either.</v>

2428
01:52:31.201 --> 01:52:34.470
<v Speaker 5>Like it makes me think like you know</v>
<v Speaker 5>something about yourself that you don't</v>

2429
01:52:34.471 --> 01:52:35.460
<v Speaker 5>want to solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2430
01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:36.360
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

2431
01:52:36.980 --> 01:52:39.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I'm on mushrooms and stuff I,</v>

2432
01:52:39.051 --> 01:52:42.900
<v Speaker 5>I like hanging out and not being a</v>
<v Speaker 5>retard and not having like a bunch of</v>

2433
01:52:42.901 --> 01:52:46.070
<v Speaker 5>people around me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I like I like just know one</v>

2434
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:47.000
<v Speaker 7>other person,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2435
01:52:47.001 --> 01:52:49.610
<v Speaker 7>either a girlfriend or like a best</v>
<v Speaker 7>friend.</v>

2436
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:54.170
<v Speaker 7>I don't need 20 people getting in like</v>
<v Speaker 7>20 different things that could go wrong.</v>

2437
01:52:54.230 --> 01:52:55.100
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>not only that,</v>

2438
01:52:55.220 --> 01:52:57.380
<v Speaker 7>at least one of them's going to have a</v>
<v Speaker 7>problem.</v>

2439
01:52:57.540 --> 01:53:00.740
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Every time you have a group of six or</v>

2440
01:53:00.741 --> 01:53:03.680
<v Speaker 7>more people that are doing mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 7>one person freaks out.</v>

2441
01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:06.260
<v Speaker 7>They always freak out,</v>
<v Speaker 7>become your problem if you don't watch</v>

2442
01:53:06.261 --> 01:53:06.741
<v Speaker 7>out,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I like being quiet.</v>

2444
01:53:08.350 --> 01:53:11.780
<v Speaker 7>Not just fold them your problem,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but there's some people that when you're</v>

2445
01:53:11.781 --> 01:53:14.810
<v Speaker 7>on trips with them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they want to dedicate the trip to their</v>

2446
01:53:14.811 --> 01:53:17.060
<v Speaker 7>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They want to dedicate your trip to their</v>

2447
01:53:17.061 --> 01:53:18.830
<v Speaker 7>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They want your trip to be about their</v>

2448
01:53:18.831 --> 01:53:19.371
<v Speaker 7>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Dude,</v>

2449
01:53:19.371 --> 01:53:21.200
<v Speaker 7>I'm seeing this and do this as</v>
<v Speaker 7>happening.</v>

2450
01:53:21.410 --> 01:53:22.310
<v Speaker 7>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm feeling this like,</v>

2451
01:53:22.311 --> 01:53:24.050
<v Speaker 7>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm over here doing my own thing,</v>

2452
01:53:24.051 --> 01:53:26.810
<v Speaker 7>man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't want to constantly be involved</v>

2453
01:53:26.811 --> 01:53:29.660
<v Speaker 7>in your reporting of your trip while I'm</v>
<v Speaker 7>tripping.</v>

2454
01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:31.850
<v Speaker 7>So like if you have too many people</v>
<v Speaker 7>together,</v>

2455
01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:34.100
<v Speaker 7>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you gotta have you gotta trip with</v>

2456
01:53:34.101 --> 01:53:35.360
<v Speaker 7>someone who knows how to shut the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 7>up.</v>

2457
01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:36.830
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a big part.</v>

2458
01:53:36.831 --> 01:53:40.310
<v Speaker 7>And that's what's incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is that that always blows my mind is</v>

2459
01:53:40.311 --> 01:53:43.220
<v Speaker 7>that's how it ends up happening when we</v>
<v Speaker 7>take our little,</v>

2460
01:53:43.221 --> 01:53:47.060
<v Speaker 7>like the holiday that are shipped,</v>
<v Speaker 7>fear started streaming fest.</v>

2461
01:53:47.061 --> 01:53:50.840
<v Speaker 7>So once a year we go out there in the</v>
<v Speaker 7>middle of the beautiful desert.</v>

2462
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:53.540
<v Speaker 7>You wait until the moon set its</v>
<v Speaker 7>brightest of the year,</v>

2463
01:53:53.541 --> 01:53:57.650
<v Speaker 7>the supermen.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's always incredible how quiet and</v>

2464
01:53:57.740 --> 01:54:00.830
<v Speaker 7>beautiful it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All these guys like six slash seven,</v>

2465
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:02.960
<v Speaker 7>I guess it's normally like five,</v>
<v Speaker 7>six,</v>

2466
01:54:02.961 --> 01:54:06.380
<v Speaker 7>seven comedians that spend every other</v>
<v Speaker 7>night talking,</v>

2467
01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:08.990
<v Speaker 7>just you see them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We all end up scattering.</v>

2468
01:54:08.991 --> 01:54:12.140
<v Speaker 7>It's not like we're sitting by a</v>
<v Speaker 7>campfire or anything and you see little</v>

2469
01:54:12.141 --> 01:54:14.060
<v Speaker 7>story outlines of like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

2470
01:54:14.061 --> 01:54:16.640
<v Speaker 7>that's Ryan Mervis over there just</v>
<v Speaker 7>standing there and you.</v>

2471
01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:19.160
<v Speaker 7>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's amazing how quiet that beautiful</v>

2472
01:54:19.161 --> 01:54:24.161
<v Speaker 7>desert can be with these personalities.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You almost feel like the power of it a</v>

2473
01:54:24.891 --> 01:54:28.260
<v Speaker 7>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a potent psychedelic drug man.</v>

2474
01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:32.180
<v Speaker 7>And if you use the right intention,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you have the right ideas going into</v>

2475
01:54:32.181 --> 01:54:33.140
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and if you can handle it,</v>

2476
01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:35.690
<v Speaker 7>you can get some wild thoughts out of</v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

2477
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:39.500
<v Speaker 7>They're very beneficial and people will</v>
<v Speaker 7>dismiss people like,</v>

2478
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:40.940
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people that have done it.</v>

2479
01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:41.930
<v Speaker 7>They'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2480
01:54:42.050 --> 01:54:43.550
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't even like what he does.</v>

2481
01:54:43.630 --> 01:54:45.320
<v Speaker 7>He's done mushrooms and why would I do</v>
<v Speaker 7>it?</v>

2482
01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:49.700
<v Speaker 7>It ain't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not disputable.</v>

2483
01:54:49.730 --> 01:54:52.310
<v Speaker 7>Like the experience is not disputable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's powerful.</v>

2484
01:54:52.380 --> 01:54:55.310
<v Speaker 7>It's undeniably powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It might not be for you.</v>

2485
01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:57.110
<v Speaker 7>I don't know you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It cares.</v>

2486
01:54:57.111 --> 01:54:59.510
<v Speaker 7>People have depression cures,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people of addiction,</v>

2487
01:54:59.630 --> 01:55:01.130
<v Speaker 7>cures,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people of cigarette addiction,</v>

2488
01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:02.060
<v Speaker 7>cures,</v>
<v Speaker 7>people of Alcohol,</v>

2489
01:55:02.061 --> 01:55:03.300
<v Speaker 7>addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 7>curious people.</v>

2490
01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:05.510
<v Speaker 7>It's give.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It gives you a chance to look at</v>

2491
01:55:05.511 --> 01:55:09.080
<v Speaker 7>yourself in a way that you probably</v>
<v Speaker 7>would never be able to get to without</v>

2492
01:55:09.081 --> 01:55:10.820
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and it'll give it to you for a short</v>

2493
01:55:10.821 --> 01:55:14.030
<v Speaker 7>window to get to see yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You get to see live.</v>

2494
01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:17.930
<v Speaker 7>You get to see intention.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You just see the past.</v>

2495
01:55:17.931 --> 01:55:21.290
<v Speaker 7>You get to see the present.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You get to see it all combined together</v>

2496
01:55:21.291 --> 01:55:24.620
<v Speaker 7>and some strange light of this other</v>
<v Speaker 7>worldly intelligence.</v>

2497
01:55:24.621 --> 01:55:29.621
<v Speaker 7>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like overwhelmingly powerful new thought</v>

2498
01:55:29.660 --> 01:55:33.830
<v Speaker 7>process that's going on in your head or</v>
<v Speaker 7>just overwhelmed and you're seeing</v>

2499
01:55:33.831 --> 01:55:37.520
<v Speaker 7>things and the visualizations when you</v>
<v Speaker 7>close your eyes are spectacular.</v>

2500
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:40.550
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>somehow or another it's illegal.</v>

2501
01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 7>Insane as the best part about</v>

2502
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:45.180
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so stupid.</v>

2503
01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:47.160
<v Speaker 6>It's the stupidest thing to have illegal</v>
<v Speaker 6>ever.</v>

2504
01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:48.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like this.</v>

2505
01:55:48.301 --> 01:55:50.380
<v Speaker 6>The one thing that makes people better,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like we,</v>

2506
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:52.920
<v Speaker 6>we know it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it's John Hopkins University did</v>

2507
01:55:52.921 --> 01:55:55.080
<v Speaker 6>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They did a thing on people that are</v>

2508
01:55:55.081 --> 01:55:57.540
<v Speaker 6>dying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People that have had.</v>

2509
01:55:58.620 --> 01:56:00.300
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>actually it was a personality that was a</v>

2510
01:56:00.301 --> 01:56:02.700
<v Speaker 6>different one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They did one on people that are dying.</v>

2511
01:56:02.940 --> 01:56:07.940
<v Speaker 6>They gave them a silicide ben and</v>
<v Speaker 6>significantly alleviated their stress</v>

2512
01:56:08.221 --> 01:56:11.670
<v Speaker 6>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then they did another one on people</v>

2513
01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:16.230
<v Speaker 6>that John Hopkins one was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they had these people do a psychedelic</v>

2514
01:56:16.231 --> 01:56:18.540
<v Speaker 6>experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>psychedelic experience.</v>

2515
01:56:18.541 --> 01:56:22.230
<v Speaker 6>And then like over a decade later,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were still saying that the quality</v>

2516
01:56:22.231 --> 01:56:24.540
<v Speaker 6>of their life significantly changed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>After that experience.</v>

2517
01:56:25.050 --> 01:56:27.590
<v Speaker 6>A lot of them were saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of benefits.</v>

2518
01:56:27.610 --> 01:56:30.000
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of these different things</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they made illegal in 1970.</v>

2519
01:56:30.001 --> 01:56:31.410
<v Speaker 6>We just got to face up to the facts.</v>

2520
01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:34.050
<v Speaker 6>We've got fucked by the same people that</v>
<v Speaker 6>had Nixon in power,</v>

2521
01:56:34.380 --> 01:56:38.040
<v Speaker 6>Lyndon Johnson and those types of people</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we shouldn't be held prisoner these</v>

2522
01:56:38.041 --> 01:56:39.570
<v Speaker 6>old ways of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Totally.</v>

2523
01:56:39.571 --> 01:56:42.000
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think that law enforcement and</v>

2524
01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:43.070
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2525
01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:45.870
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people that control laws and</v>
<v Speaker 6>have laws in place,</v>

2526
01:56:45.871 --> 01:56:49.140
<v Speaker 6>they're very reluctant to give up a law</v>
<v Speaker 6>or to admit that all the arrests that</v>

2527
01:56:49.141 --> 01:56:53.640
<v Speaker 6>they made were unjust because it opens</v>
<v Speaker 6>up this giant bow backs of,</v>

2528
01:56:53.670 --> 01:56:54.600
<v Speaker 6>of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2529
01:56:54.601 --> 01:56:58.080
<v Speaker 6>like looking at all these people that</v>
<v Speaker 6>are in jail for nonviolent drug crimes.</v>

2530
01:56:58.081 --> 01:57:00.900
<v Speaker 6>Now those drugs are legal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck do you do with all those</v>

2531
01:57:00.901 --> 01:57:03.030
<v Speaker 6>people in jail?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2532
01:57:03.050 --> 01:57:04.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>

2533
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:05.783
<v Speaker 6>Once Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

2534
01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:08.100
<v Speaker 6>they're letting people out there letting</v>
<v Speaker 6>people,</v>

2535
01:57:08.101 --> 01:57:10.890
<v Speaker 6>people that were in for pot and people</v>
<v Speaker 6>that were selling pot,</v>

2536
01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:12.900
<v Speaker 6>they're dropping their cases</v>

2537
01:57:13.570 --> 01:57:15.320
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those things too where,</v>

2538
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:16.780
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's crazy is like,</v>

2539
01:57:17.570 --> 01:57:19.220
<v Speaker 5>I guess you haven't seen making a</v>
<v Speaker 5>murder,</v>

2540
01:57:19.221 --> 01:57:21.350
<v Speaker 5>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know the premise though,</v>

2541
01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:23.240
<v Speaker 5>but the pain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the premise is that like,</v>

2542
01:57:23.241 --> 01:57:26.570
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was in prison for all those years,</v>

2543
01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:29.390
<v Speaker 5>so maybe he did do this and if he did do</v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2544
01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:32.770
<v Speaker 5>he did it because he learned these bad</v>
<v Speaker 5>ways in prison.</v>

2545
01:57:32.771 --> 01:57:35.420
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which brings it back to the jug people</v>

2546
01:57:35.421 --> 01:57:36.920
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like they might go in,</v>

2547
01:57:36.921 --> 01:57:41.540
<v Speaker 5>be in a pot dealer and come out being a</v>
<v Speaker 5>rapist murderer because they jerked off</v>

2548
01:57:41.541 --> 01:57:44.660
<v Speaker 5>for months to their bunk mates fantasy</v>
<v Speaker 5>that he told them,</v>

2549
01:57:44.661 --> 01:57:47.270
<v Speaker 5>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I tied this bitch up and it was the most</v>

2550
01:57:47.271 --> 01:57:48.530
<v Speaker 5>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2551
01:57:48.531 --> 01:57:49.370
<v Speaker 5>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

2552
01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:52.310
<v Speaker 5>that sounds interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they get out and just start doing</v>

2553
01:57:52.311 --> 01:57:53.144
<v Speaker 5>crazy stuff like that.</v>

2554
01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:54.310
<v Speaker 6>That.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2555
01:57:54.770 --> 01:57:55.340
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

2556
01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:56.770
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2557
01:57:56.860 --> 01:57:58.140
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2558
01:57:58.170 --> 01:58:01.400
<v Speaker 5>that's the recidivism rate of these</v>
<v Speaker 5>presences.</v>

2559
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:04.920
<v Speaker 5>Insane because.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I did all this research on it when</v>

2560
01:58:04.921 --> 01:58:08.520
<v Speaker 5>Jeff Ross did his prison special for</v>
<v Speaker 5>comedy central.</v>

2561
01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:10.620
<v Speaker 5>I learned all about this stuff.</v>

2562
01:58:10.940 --> 01:58:12.830
<v Speaker 6>Jeff had a really powerful thing about</v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2563
01:58:12.860 --> 01:58:13.840
<v Speaker 6>that he.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He didn't like,</v>

2564
01:58:14.030 --> 01:58:17.090
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't an interview or what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tweeted it,</v>

2565
01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:20.600
<v Speaker 6>I forget what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he was talking about like what he</v>

2566
01:58:20.601 --> 01:58:24.110
<v Speaker 6>learned about the prison system and how</v>
<v Speaker 6>hopeless it is for the people that get</v>

2567
01:58:24.111 --> 01:58:27.410
<v Speaker 6>stuck inside of it and then you hear</v>
<v Speaker 6>about things like that guy in</v>

2568
01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:31.160
<v Speaker 6>Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that judge that was sending these kids</v>

2569
01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:34.880
<v Speaker 6>to a juvenile detention setting these</v>
<v Speaker 6>kids up the river for like nothing</v>

2570
01:58:35.090 --> 01:58:38.300
<v Speaker 6>because he was getting paid for it now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>God that he's in jail now,</v>

2571
01:58:38.570 --> 01:58:41.330
<v Speaker 6>but he was selling children to</v>
<v Speaker 6>prisoners,</v>

2572
01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:43.060
<v Speaker 6>to prisons,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to private prisons.</v>

2573
01:58:43.090 --> 01:58:44.110
<v Speaker 6>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what he was doing.</v>

2574
01:58:44.380 --> 01:58:45.520
<v Speaker 6>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a scam.</v>

2575
01:58:45.521 --> 01:58:48.700
<v Speaker 6>He was being paid off to continue to</v>
<v Speaker 6>supply them with prisoners.</v>

2576
01:58:48.970 --> 01:58:52.330
<v Speaker 6>So he was taking these kids and just</v>
<v Speaker 6>ruining their lives.</v>

2577
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:54.340
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like ruined countless people's lives.</v>

2578
01:58:54.341 --> 01:58:57.400
<v Speaker 6>Took people for minor offenses that</v>
<v Speaker 6>should have never done time.</v>

2579
01:58:57.401 --> 01:59:01.810
<v Speaker 6>They just kids and just locked him up</v>
<v Speaker 6>and fucked him over and then he kept</v>

2580
01:59:01.811 --> 01:59:04.390
<v Speaker 6>them trapped and imagine how terrified</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd be your 15,</v>

2581
01:59:04.391 --> 01:59:07.570
<v Speaker 6>16 year old kid and you do some normal</v>
<v Speaker 6>kid shit and all sudden you get</v>

2582
01:59:07.571 --> 01:59:11.230
<v Speaker 6>railroaded through this justice system</v>
<v Speaker 6>and this guy who corrupt sends you to a</v>

2583
01:59:11.231 --> 01:59:14.050
<v Speaker 6>detention to get you away from your</v>
<v Speaker 6>parents and all of a sudden you're</v>

2585
01:59:17.471 --> 01:59:18.490
<v Speaker 6>legit criminals.</v>

2586
01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:22.480
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's like insane.</v>

2587
01:59:23.340 --> 01:59:24.880
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't mean that all judges are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

2588
01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:25.773
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>

2589
01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:27.130
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't mean all judges would do</v>
<v Speaker 7>that,</v>

2590
01:59:27.131 --> 01:59:30.010
<v Speaker 7>but fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Universal soldier was shit.</v>

2617
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:53.610
<v Speaker 7>That was a good movie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2618
02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:54.880
<v Speaker 7>it turned them into.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's right.</v>

2619
02:00:54.940 --> 02:00:56.260
<v Speaker 7>That's exactly what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Look,</v>

2620
02:00:56.261 --> 02:00:59.650
<v Speaker 7>that's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's probably possible before they</v>

2621
02:00:59.651 --> 02:01:01.240
<v Speaker 7>even figured out how to do the robot</v>
<v Speaker 7>thing.</v>

2622
02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:03.370
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I probably figured out how to program</v>

2623
02:01:03.371 --> 02:01:04.860
<v Speaker 7>people's minds.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

2624
02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:09.130
<v Speaker 7>No Man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just a matter of time,</v>

2625
02:01:09.850 --> 02:01:11.050
<v Speaker 7>you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2626
02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:14.290
<v Speaker 7>It seems like Schunk glove and dum,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dum,</v>

2627
02:01:15.610 --> 02:01:16.091
<v Speaker 7>dum,</v>
<v Speaker 7>dum,</v>

2628
02:01:16.091 --> 02:01:19.690
<v Speaker 7>dum.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We got laser design.</v>

2629
02:01:19.790 --> 02:01:23.680
<v Speaker 7>It must be serious.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It was so hilarious.</v>

2630
02:01:24.930 --> 02:01:26.920
<v Speaker 7>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah.</v>

2631
02:01:27.520 --> 02:01:30.580
<v Speaker 7>Tiny Lester in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's hilarious.</v>

2632
02:01:31.690 --> 02:01:34.750
<v Speaker 7>Those movies were fun.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I roasted tiny list are at that same</v>

2633
02:01:34.751 --> 02:01:36.340
<v Speaker 7>roast with a.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That screech.</v>

2634
02:01:36.341 --> 02:01:38.110
<v Speaker 7>Was that what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Let me ask you this.</v>

2635
02:01:38.170 --> 02:01:39.500
<v Speaker 7>If someone came along.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2636
02:01:39.501 --> 02:01:40.190
<v Speaker 7>Like what if somebody</v>

2637
02:01:40.190 --> 02:01:44.120
<v Speaker 2>was in a motorcycle accident and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were essentially brain dead and some</v>

2638
02:01:44.121 --> 02:01:49.121
<v Speaker 2>doctors came along and said that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the ability to turn this guy into a</v>

2639
02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:53.040
<v Speaker 2>soldier robot and you can go fight for</v>
<v Speaker 2>his country like your,</v>

2640
02:01:53.041 --> 02:01:53.751
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2641
02:01:53.751 --> 02:01:55.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brother's Dad,</v>

2642
02:01:55.071 --> 02:01:56.520
<v Speaker 2>Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

2643
02:01:56.780 --> 02:01:59.720
<v Speaker 2>we can keep them alive and have them go</v>
<v Speaker 2>defend his country.</v>

2644
02:02:00.140 --> 02:02:01.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to send them over to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan.</v>

2645
02:02:02.860 --> 02:02:03.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2646
02:02:03.630 --> 02:02:05.480
<v Speaker 2>might as well better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't buried,</v>

2647
02:02:05.481 --> 02:02:06.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think so?</v>

2648
02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that what deadpool does?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deadpool comic isn't think I love.</v>

2649
02:02:11.590 --> 02:02:13.820
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't he have like a super powers or</v>

2650
02:02:13.821 --> 02:02:15.560
<v Speaker 2>some shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They gave him some sort of bad ass</v>

2651
02:02:15.590 --> 02:02:18.020
<v Speaker 2>powers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was going to die or he's given</v>

2652
02:02:18.021 --> 02:02:19.160
<v Speaker 2>terminal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2653
02:02:19.161 --> 02:02:21.050
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a comic book that I was never</v>

2654
02:02:21.051 --> 02:02:23.180
<v Speaker 2>aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when this one comes out,</v>

2655
02:02:23.210 --> 02:02:26.120
<v Speaker 2>I am completely out of my element.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about.</v>

2656
02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:27.500
<v Speaker 2>That was a marvel though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2657
02:02:27.501 --> 02:02:29.990
<v Speaker 2>It was a marvel comic arguing for it</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

2658
02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.490
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't dress well.</v>

2659
02:02:31.491 --> 02:02:33.200
<v Speaker 2>This is a movie that almost didn't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>made,</v>

2660
02:02:33.390 --> 02:02:35.990
<v Speaker 2>but then they made a really cool like</v>
<v Speaker 2>trailer.</v>

2661
02:02:35.991 --> 02:02:39.740
<v Speaker 2>Someone made a fun trailer and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest for it picked up.</v>

2662
02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:42.980
<v Speaker 2>So they decided to make the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the movie?</v>

2663
02:02:43.290 --> 02:02:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Deadpool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made this fake Valentine's Day.</v>

2664
02:02:46.890 --> 02:02:50.450
<v Speaker 2>Tried to trick some people a true love</v>
<v Speaker 2>never dies.</v>

2665
02:02:50.451 --> 02:02:51.284
<v Speaker 2>Valentine's Day.</v>

2666
02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:58.670
<v Speaker 2>Romcom style posters and Ryan Mental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just taking full advantage.</v>

2667
02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:01.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be interesting.</v>

2668
02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:05.600
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's gonna come a time where they can</v>

2669
02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:11.500
<v Speaker 2>sort of re reanimate a human body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put an artificial brain and it might be</v>

2670
02:03:13.071 --> 02:03:15.470
<v Speaker 2>the first thing they do before they go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to artificial intelligence.</v>

2671
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Take some dude because his head blown</v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

2672
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:19.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like that dead dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hard.</v>

2673
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:21.760
<v Speaker 2>It's still hanging on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

2674
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:24.000
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not thought out yet or not.</v>

2675
02:03:24.001 --> 02:03:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not thickened up.</v>

2676
02:03:26.780 --> 02:03:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just keep it going to slap some</v>

2677
02:03:28.821 --> 02:03:30.360
<v Speaker 2>robot head on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Screw it down</v>

2678
02:03:33.340 --> 02:03:35.420
<v Speaker 2>like robocop style,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a pit crew.</v>

2679
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:42.800
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it funny how like Robocop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you watch that movie back in the</v>

2680
02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:45.050
<v Speaker 2>day it was like this is so never going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to happen.</v>

2681
02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:46.730
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but today you're like,</v>

2682
02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:50.360
<v Speaker 2>well I bet they could probably do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2683
02:03:50.361 --> 02:03:54.740
<v Speaker 2>but we're probably pretty close to being</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to come up with some artificial</v>

2684
02:03:54.741 --> 02:03:58.940
<v Speaker 2>limbs that are more strong and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamic and they just have to have some</v>

2685
02:03:58.941 --> 02:04:01.970
<v Speaker 2>sort of a power source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is robocop.</v>

2686
02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a dope outfit to the new robocop.</v>

2687
02:04:05.580 --> 02:04:07.910
<v Speaker 2>I never saw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't really into the new outfit that</v>

2688
02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:10.190
<v Speaker 2>you just didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the new one.</v>

2689
02:04:11.390 --> 02:04:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Did you watch the new one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2690
02:04:12.711 --> 02:04:14.390
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that is the new one.</v>

2691
02:04:14.391 --> 02:04:15.920
<v Speaker 2>I met that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2692
02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See why?</v>

2693
02:04:17.271 --> 02:04:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Why does he have his hands covered?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna Chop your hands off,</v>

2694
02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:22.820
<v Speaker 2>which we've got to have your hands</v>
<v Speaker 2>covered.</v>

2695
02:04:22.850 --> 02:04:24.470
<v Speaker 2>How come you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your mouth isn't covered either.</v>

2696
02:04:24.510 --> 02:04:27.020
<v Speaker 2>Shoot you right in the mouth one</v>
<v Speaker 2>identified the weak spots.</v>

2697
02:04:27.330 --> 02:04:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to have an exposed mouth</v>

2698
02:04:29.601 --> 02:04:31.040
<v Speaker 2>hole one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2699
02:04:31.190 --> 02:04:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Why would you ever have your exposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth?</v>

2700
02:04:33.670 --> 02:04:36.920
<v Speaker 2>He's got his whole face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His whole faith is ready to be shot</v>

2701
02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:38.400
<v Speaker 2>because I'm assuming</v>

2702
02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:39.690
<v Speaker 7>there's a brain back there,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

<v Speaker 7>I'm gonna shoot the right to your</v>

2705
02:04:43.351 --> 02:04:45.390
<v Speaker 7>eyeballs in your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So stupid.</v>

2707
02:04:47.941 --> 02:04:49.110
<v Speaker 7>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why would you have that?</v>

2708
02:04:49.111 --> 02:04:51.840
<v Speaker 7>When everything else is protected,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't project.</v>

2709
02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:53.820
<v Speaker 7>You'll have some sort of a speaker on</v>
<v Speaker 7>the outside.</v>

2710
02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:58.340
<v Speaker 7>There's so many veins and important</v>
<v Speaker 7>arteries that run around equity or how's</v>

2711
02:04:58.341 --> 02:05:00.620
<v Speaker 7>it gonna eat with no teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's gonna get shot in the face with a</v>

<v Speaker 7>Canon in Detroit to do,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2713
02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:05.700
<v Speaker 7>it seems like the best place to put it</v>
<v Speaker 7>today.</v>

2714
02:05:05.701 --> 02:05:06.181
<v Speaker 7>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2715
02:05:06.181 --> 02:05:08.400
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No one seems to have seen this movie.</v>

2716
02:05:08.401 --> 02:05:09.840
<v Speaker 7>It must have been a robo flop.</v>

2717
02:05:12.970 --> 02:05:17.140
<v Speaker 10>He out.</v>
<v Speaker 10>He had it.</v>

2718
02:05:17.141 --> 02:05:19.900
<v Speaker 10>He delivered it.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You were stunned and now you're</v>

2719
02:05:19.901 --> 02:05:20.734
<v Speaker 10>defensive.</v>

2720
02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:23.780
<v Speaker 7>True.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I actually went and saw the movie and I</v>

2721
02:05:23.781 --> 02:05:26.260
<v Speaker 7>eat a lot of popcorn during it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was a Robo slop.</v>

2722
02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:27.230
<v Speaker 10>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 7>will know and you'll be doing all new</v>

<v Speaker 7>You did this a few months back,</v>

<v Speaker 7>like how many months?</v>
<v Speaker 7>March.</v>

2750
02:06:52.590 --> 02:06:54.890
<v Speaker 7>March.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So it's almost a year.</v>

2751
02:06:54.920 --> 02:06:55.910
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So,</v>

2752
02:06:55.911 --> 02:06:58.400
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and in that time you've got a whole new</v>

2753
02:06:58.400 --> 02:06:59.233
<v Speaker 7>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Uh,</v>

2754
02:06:59.590 --> 02:07:01.820
<v Speaker 7>I have a new,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

2755
02:07:01.821 --> 02:07:04.550
<v Speaker 7>30,</v>
<v Speaker 7>35,</v>

2756
02:07:04.551 --> 02:07:06.230
<v Speaker 7>somewhere in there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's ever changing.</v>

2757
02:07:06.231 --> 02:07:08.210
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sometimes I've been realizing lately.</v>

2758
02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:09.080
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2759
02:07:09.370 --> 02:07:11.330
<v Speaker 7>it's wibbly wobbly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you about your,</v>

2760
02:07:11.340 --> 02:07:15.950
<v Speaker 7>bounced some of it out and started going</v>
<v Speaker 7>all knew as soon as I taped it.</v>

2761
02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:18.690
<v Speaker 7>A lot of guys I guess like start when</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2762
02:07:18.890 --> 02:07:19.723
<v Speaker 7>when it comes out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2763
02:07:19.770 --> 02:07:20.890
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But like I,</v>

2764
02:07:21.380 --> 02:07:23.920
<v Speaker 7>I was ready to move on anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well you already,</v>

2765
02:07:23.921 --> 02:07:24.810
<v Speaker 7>you knew,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

2766
02:07:24.860 --> 02:07:27.350
<v Speaker 7>also the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you were going to try to get this on and</v>

2767
02:07:27.351 --> 02:07:29.090
<v Speaker 7>you get ahead of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

2768
02:07:29.180 --> 02:07:30.980
<v Speaker 7>Going out of the bat knew.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2769
02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:34.520
<v Speaker 7>I just did the fighter and the kid and</v>
<v Speaker 7>it actually came up that like they're</v>

2770
02:07:34.521 --> 02:07:35.030
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2771
02:07:35.030 --> 02:07:36.130
<v Speaker 7>are you doing all new stuff</v>

2772
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:37.330
<v Speaker 5>now?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I talked about how,</v>

2773
02:07:37.670 --> 02:07:39.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>working with you being,</v>

2774
02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:42.850
<v Speaker 5>you're one of the few guys in the whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>game that also,</v>

2775
02:07:42.851 --> 02:07:46.060
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like generates not also you're one of</v>

2776
02:07:46.120 --> 02:07:50.330
<v Speaker 5>the few comedians that has like a new</v>
<v Speaker 5>hour a year or you know,</v>

2777
02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:55.320
<v Speaker 5>and so like working with you even though</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've never said to me personally like</v>

2778
02:07:55.330 --> 02:08:00.220
<v Speaker 5>you need to write more material.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it naturally I think rubs off that,</v>

2779
02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:03.020
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>were you got to just keep going and plow</v>

2780
02:08:03.021 --> 02:08:04.190
<v Speaker 5>and like if um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>

2781
02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:08.170
<v Speaker 5>if you can do it with an hour and a half</v>
<v Speaker 5>or two hours after my half hour than I</v>

2782
02:08:08.171 --> 02:08:10.060
<v Speaker 5>should be doing it with my half hour,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2783
02:08:10.061 --> 02:08:11.440
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it helps a little.</v>

2784
02:08:11.460 --> 02:08:14.490
<v Speaker 6>When you do a longer sets,</v>
<v Speaker 6>longer sets on the weekends helps,</v>

2785
02:08:14.580 --> 02:08:16.920
<v Speaker 6>you know what.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But anytime you can get it in a half</v>

2786
02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:18.390
<v Speaker 6>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you can get in a half an hour set,</v>

2787
02:08:18.690 --> 02:08:20.910
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the real problem with La is if you're</v>

2788
02:08:20.911 --> 02:08:23.100
<v Speaker 6>going to do a spot in La,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you probably going to get 15 minutes.</v>

2789
02:08:23.130 --> 02:08:25.080
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when you get those 15 minutes spots,</v>

2790
02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:29.700
<v Speaker 6>most likely you'll have room for one or</v>
<v Speaker 6>two new ideas and you'll have,</v>

2791
02:08:29.730 --> 02:08:31.580
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I always try to balance it out if I'm</v>

2792
02:08:31.590 --> 02:08:33.670
<v Speaker 6>doing new stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>unless I did like I did stand up on a</v>

2793
02:08:33.671 --> 02:08:37.020
<v Speaker 6>spot last night,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is obviously all adlibbed and that</v>

2794
02:08:37.021 --> 02:08:39.350
<v Speaker 6>was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But when you do new stuff you've got to</v>

2795
02:08:39.351 --> 02:08:40.650
<v Speaker 6>kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2796
02:08:40.690 --> 02:08:43.260
<v Speaker 6>it's hard to decide like when to start</v>
<v Speaker 6>the new stuff.</v>

2797
02:08:43.261 --> 02:08:46.200
<v Speaker 6>Do you open with the new stuff or do you</v>
<v Speaker 6>open with something established?</v>

2798
02:08:46.201 --> 02:08:48.420
<v Speaker 6>Get the ball rolling and then introduced</v>
<v Speaker 6>the new stuff.</v>

2799
02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:51.320
<v Speaker 6>You don't have a lot of time to fuck</v>
<v Speaker 6>around and like 15 minutes set.</v>

2800
02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:52.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I also,</v>

2801
02:08:52.621 --> 02:08:55.460
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to bounce in and out once in a</v>

2802
02:08:55.461 --> 02:08:57.660
<v Speaker 5>while of crowd work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2803
02:08:57.661 --> 02:09:01.510
<v Speaker 5>and him improvising stuff onstage and</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2804
02:09:02.610 --> 02:09:07.140
<v Speaker 5>said that's also mixed into things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's also part of the reason why I</v>

2805
02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:12.200
<v Speaker 5>shot this in one shot because I just</v>
<v Speaker 5>went with my gut and I'm like,</v>

2806
02:09:12.661 --> 02:09:16.830
<v Speaker 5>if things go off the track,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's normally when I shine is like</v>

2807
02:09:16.831 --> 02:09:18.510
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see like sometimes when we do our</v>

2808
02:09:18.511 --> 02:09:21.960
<v Speaker 5>shows that those big theaters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I'll do a thing where our roast</v>

2809
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:23.220
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a group of people,</v>

2810
02:09:23.221 --> 02:09:25.680
<v Speaker 5>if they come in late and I warned the</v>
<v Speaker 5>crowd in the beginning.</v>

2811
02:09:25.681 --> 02:09:27.570
<v Speaker 5>Like if somebody comes in late I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 5>to light them up,</v>

2812
02:09:27.571 --> 02:09:28.650
<v Speaker 5>our little secret.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2813
02:09:28.651 --> 02:09:30.900
<v Speaker 5>And the place just loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I love that,</v>

2814
02:09:30.901 --> 02:09:32.430
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just improvising in the moment.</v>

2815
02:09:32.431 --> 02:09:35.460
<v Speaker 5>I love that pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love that feeling of like,</v>

2816
02:09:35.461 --> 02:09:39.000
<v Speaker 5>you know like being a quarterback and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you feel like that line backer coming,</v>

2817
02:09:39.001 --> 02:09:40.530
<v Speaker 5>but you still have to get rid of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>ball.</v>

2818
02:09:40.530 --> 02:09:44.850
<v Speaker 5>You have to just stay calm and deliver.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think part of the reason why I did</v>

2819
02:09:44.851 --> 02:09:47.760
<v Speaker 5>it all in one shot is because I knew</v>
<v Speaker 5>that if something,</v>

2820
02:09:47.761 --> 02:09:51.510
<v Speaker 5>which it didn't at all and I didn't end</v>
<v Speaker 5>up doing any crowd work and I sort of</v>

2821
02:09:51.511 --> 02:09:54.240
<v Speaker 5>was half planning,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I was on the towing the line right</v>

2822
02:09:54.241 --> 02:09:55.650
<v Speaker 5>before I went on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2823
02:09:56.190 --> 02:09:57.850
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2824
02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:03.120
<v Speaker 5>anything can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I knew that I only had one show which is</v>

2825
02:10:03.121 --> 02:10:07.740
<v Speaker 5>rare in itself when shooting a special</v>
<v Speaker 5>to only have one show in one audience</v>

2826
02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:11.730
<v Speaker 5>and one camera and I was ready to do</v>
<v Speaker 5>crowd work,</v>

2827
02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:15.960
<v Speaker 5>but I just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll see in like the first 15 seconds</v>

2828
02:10:15.961 --> 02:10:17.130
<v Speaker 5>I just sorta like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2829
02:10:17.550 --> 02:10:20.790
<v Speaker 5>just saying hello.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I go right into material.</v>

2830
02:10:21.330 --> 02:10:23.770
<v Speaker 6>You get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you wouldn't do it like a regular show,</v>

2831
02:10:23.771 --> 02:10:24.210
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2832
02:10:24.210 --> 02:10:26.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ended up just doing material and it</v>

2833
02:10:26.610 --> 02:10:29.360
<v Speaker 5>sort of stayed on track.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a part where uh,</v>

2834
02:10:29.410 --> 02:10:30.870
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I dunno like 35,</v>

2835
02:10:30.871 --> 02:10:33.710
<v Speaker 5>40 minutes in or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My throat goes dry,</v>

2836
02:10:33.711 --> 02:10:36.500
<v Speaker 5>which like never happens.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But like I was like sorta like,</v>

2837
02:10:36.530 --> 02:10:39.290
<v Speaker 5>choked up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I take a sip of my water that's</v>

2838
02:10:39.291 --> 02:10:41.660
<v Speaker 5>sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you'll most comedians do a.</v>

2839
02:10:41.770 --> 02:10:44.780
<v Speaker 5>most comedians take a sip of their drink</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they're getting a huge applause</v>

2840
02:10:44.781 --> 02:10:47.000
<v Speaker 5>break.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a special special.</v>

2841
02:10:47.630 --> 02:10:49.810
<v Speaker 5>Then they just giggled because they all</v>
<v Speaker 5>know that,</v>

2842
02:10:49.850 --> 02:10:50.730
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta take a leak.</v>

2843
02:10:50.731 --> 02:10:52.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm so sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've been holding this in for awhile</v>

2844
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:54.950
<v Speaker 4>for some strange reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Brian talked to him real quick.</v>

2845
02:10:55.830 --> 02:10:56.630
<v Speaker 5>Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2846
02:10:56.630 --> 02:10:58.880
<v Speaker 5>Normally you bust my balls when I have</v>
<v Speaker 5>to pay</v>

2847
02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:05.720
<v Speaker 5>Brian White.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2848
02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:08.560
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was cool that they're doing the one</v>

2849
02:11:08.561 --> 02:11:09.351
<v Speaker 5>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you,</v>

2850
02:11:09.351 --> 02:11:11.690
<v Speaker 5>after it was done,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did you think like,</v>

2851
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:14.000
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish I would have done that different</v>

2852
02:11:14.001 --> 02:11:16.100
<v Speaker 5>or this different?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was there anything that you kind of wish</v>

2853
02:11:16.130 --> 02:11:17.960
<v Speaker 5>now looking at it that you did</v>
<v Speaker 5>different?</v>

2854
02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:20.870
<v Speaker 5>Other if you had the chance?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course.</v>

2855
02:11:20.871 --> 02:11:22.280
<v Speaker 5>I mean naturally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2856
02:11:22.281 --> 02:11:25.330
<v Speaker 5>after doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's always like,</v>

2857
02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:28.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things that change are different.</v>

2858
02:11:28.760 --> 02:11:31.070
<v Speaker 5>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I close with,</v>

2859
02:11:31.190 --> 02:11:34.580
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even in March I had a different version</v>

2860
02:11:34.610 --> 02:11:39.610
<v Speaker 5>of the cosby thing that I do now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it totally different joke entirely.</v>

2861
02:11:40.190 --> 02:11:41.990
<v Speaker 5>You were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bill Cosby's innocent.</v>

2862
02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:44.560
<v Speaker 5>I know it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2863
02:11:44.630 --> 02:11:49.010
<v Speaker 5>sort of it was because now in my cosby</v>
<v Speaker 5>joke now has everything to do with how</v>

2864
02:11:49.011 --> 02:11:53.770
<v Speaker 5>he admitted to giving girls Quaye lutes</v>
<v Speaker 5>and rape them and the cosby joke that's</v>

2865
02:11:53.780 --> 02:11:54.710
<v Speaker 5>on one shot.</v>

2866
02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:59.510
<v Speaker 5>It just covers the fact that like</v>
<v Speaker 5>basically it's all these little white</v>

2867
02:11:59.511 --> 02:12:03.890
<v Speaker 5>girls that hooked up with a rich black</v>
<v Speaker 5>man for the first time and they just</v>

2868
02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:06.920
<v Speaker 5>felt dizzy because his dick was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

2869
02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:09.950
<v Speaker 5>So I just ruined the ending.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that A.</v>

2870
02:12:09.951 --> 02:12:12.500
<v Speaker 5>is that a real curl?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you show the camera,</v>

2871
02:12:12.510 --> 02:12:17.030
<v Speaker 5>your curly hair with this one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks like it's like a tightly curled</v>

2872
02:12:17.610 --> 02:12:20.770
<v Speaker 5>up in.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes if you have a bow now it's</v>

2873
02:12:20.780 --> 02:12:25.190
<v Speaker 5>just my curly Italian hair sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember when I had long hair.</v>

2874
02:12:25.250 --> 02:12:26.083
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's right.</v>

2875
02:12:26.110 --> 02:12:28.520
<v Speaker 5>He's going to from my apologies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All good.</v>

2876
02:12:28.610 --> 02:12:29.990
<v Speaker 5>That was a close one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2877
02:12:30.260 --> 02:12:32.570
<v Speaker 5>it was interfering with my ability to</v>
<v Speaker 5>form conversation.</v>

2878
02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:33.853
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

2879
02:12:34.780 --> 02:12:36.380
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe he's Brian Moses Story.</v>

2880
02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:40.580
<v Speaker 5>Turn it planted the seed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe just let it go.</v>

2881
02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:42.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not a good idea.</v>

2882
02:12:42.660 --> 02:12:44.680
<v Speaker 5>Imagine if we come in here and it smells</v>
<v Speaker 5>like piss everyday.</v>

2883
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:47.730
<v Speaker 5>ASPARAGUS piss.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

2884
02:12:47.810 --> 02:12:49.070
<v Speaker 5>Have you repeat herself?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2885
02:12:49.071 --> 02:12:49.970
<v Speaker 5>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2886
02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:52.940
<v Speaker 5>Who hasn't?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean and then had to wear your pants</v>

2887
02:12:52.941 --> 02:12:53.810
<v Speaker 5>for a long period</v>

2888
02:12:53.870 --> 02:12:58.700
<v Speaker 4>car once in a like a mountain dew bottle</v>
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>

2889
02:12:58.710 --> 02:13:00.690
<v Speaker 4>Like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had like some sort of a soda bottle</v>

2890
02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:04.240
<v Speaker 5>got pissed all over my Fiat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really hard to do because you don't</v>

2891
02:13:04.241 --> 02:13:09.241
<v Speaker 5>realize that you need to have enough</v>
<v Speaker 5>extra air around it or else it just</v>

2892
02:13:09.761 --> 02:13:13.150
<v Speaker 5>sprays back at you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've done that three bottles.</v>

2893
02:13:13.151 --> 02:13:14.410
<v Speaker 5>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Gatorade's good.</v>

2894
02:13:14.411 --> 02:13:15.460
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very girthy,</v>

2895
02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:17.073
<v Speaker 5>gatorades.</v>

2896
02:13:17.370 --> 02:13:20.730
<v Speaker 4>Other ones you have to also use two</v>
<v Speaker 4>hands because you want to hold your Dick</v>

2897
02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:23.550
<v Speaker 4>over the hole and you want to hold the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bottle and you can't do that while</v>

2898
02:13:23.551 --> 02:13:27.180
<v Speaker 4>you're driving so you're trying to like</v>
<v Speaker 4>get your Dick in between your two</v>

2899
02:13:27.181 --> 02:13:32.181
<v Speaker 4>fingers and then use your ring finger</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're to kind of hold the bottle</v>

2900
02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:36.720
<v Speaker 4>while you're squeezing your dick through</v>
<v Speaker 4>and don't put your balls in either,</v>

2901
02:13:36.721 --> 02:13:38.340
<v Speaker 4>just to keep those out when you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2902
02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:39.580
<v Speaker 4>There's no reason to put your policy in</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2903
02:13:39.630 --> 02:13:42.540
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you Brian can actually falls into a</v>

2904
02:13:43.750 --> 02:13:46.650
<v Speaker 4>bottle of mountain dew unless you have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>moonshine jug and your truck.</v>

2905
02:13:46.930 --> 02:13:50.460
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if that's how you died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You hit a bump in the moonshine jar,</v>

2906
02:13:50.461 --> 02:13:53.040
<v Speaker 4>broke and cut a vital artery under your</v>
<v Speaker 4>cock because you turn to</v>

2907
02:13:54.530 --> 02:13:56.720
<v Speaker 5>the mountain dews a dangerous bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The pen,</v>

2908
02:13:56.721 --> 02:13:59.680
<v Speaker 5>because it's green,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you may have forgotten that,</v>

2909
02:13:59.681 --> 02:14:00.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2910
02:14:00.551 --> 02:14:01.340
<v Speaker 5>you peed in it.</v>

2911
02:14:01.340 --> 02:14:02.330
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be.</v>

2912
02:14:02.340 --> 02:14:03.650
<v Speaker 4>You're just one of those fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weirdos.</v>

2913
02:14:03.651 --> 02:14:05.430
<v Speaker 4>It picks up bottles on the floor of</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

2914
02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:08.870
<v Speaker 4>your car and just start drinking warm</v>
<v Speaker 4>liquid and you can fuck up.</v>

2915
02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:11.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to know this guy who would take a</v>

2916
02:14:11.691 --> 02:14:14.990
<v Speaker 4>mountain dew bottle of mountain dew or</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ginger Ale and he,</v>

2917
02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:18.380
<v Speaker 4>one of those green plastic bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would fill it up with booze and he</v>

2918
02:14:18.381 --> 02:14:20.750
<v Speaker 4>would drink it all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like a serious,</v>

2919
02:14:20.751 --> 02:14:24.680
<v Speaker 4>serious alcoholic that I worked with on</v>
<v Speaker 4>this construction site when I was a kid.</v>

2920
02:14:25.130 --> 02:14:25.911
<v Speaker 4>It was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2921
02:14:25.911 --> 02:14:28.220
<v Speaker 4>He would just drink all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It scared me,</v>

2922
02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:31.760
<v Speaker 4>scare me watching him because this guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>who just drink this stuff all day and it</v>

2923
02:14:31.761 --> 02:14:34.940
<v Speaker 4>was only going a day or two into the job</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I realized that it was booze,</v>

2924
02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:38.840
<v Speaker 4>talking to people that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would drink malt liquor and just all</v>

2925
02:14:38.841 --> 02:14:39.830
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all day,</v>

2926
02:14:39.831 --> 02:14:40.870
<v Speaker 4>just drink a fucking.</v>

2927
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:43.370
<v Speaker 4>And he lived in this house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The house had no electricity,</v>

2928
02:14:43.750 --> 02:14:45.320
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the windows were out,</v>

2929
02:14:45.550 --> 02:14:47.720
<v Speaker 4>like we were working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were renovating this house and he</v>

2930
02:14:47.721 --> 02:14:51.410
<v Speaker 4>lived in it while we were renovating it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was real weird and he was like a</v>

2931
02:14:51.411 --> 02:14:53.630
<v Speaker 4>construction guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He worked,</v>

2932
02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:57.380
<v Speaker 4>he worked with the guy who owned the</v>
<v Speaker 4>construction company that was renovating</v>

2933
02:14:57.381 --> 02:15:00.650
<v Speaker 4>the House and I'm pretty sure as hard as</v>
<v Speaker 4>foggy to remember because I was a</v>

2934
02:15:00.651 --> 02:15:02.480
<v Speaker 4>teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm pretty sure the guy who was</v>

2935
02:15:02.481 --> 02:15:04.940
<v Speaker 4>renovating the house also owned it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just like fixing it up.</v>

2936
02:15:05.150 --> 02:15:08.930
<v Speaker 4>And so this guy was living in it at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time when it was like gutted out,</v>

2937
02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:13.140
<v Speaker 4>just raw wood and no insulation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some windows are missing and just don't.</v>

2938
02:15:13.310 --> 02:15:17.870
<v Speaker 4>Some of the floor was missing and Scott</v>
<v Speaker 4>would just get wasted all day,</v>

2939
02:15:17.871 --> 02:15:22.871
<v Speaker 4>just drink and shake hands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would shake any on hammer and nails and</v>

2940
02:15:23.001 --> 02:15:26.770
<v Speaker 4>shit and his hands are shaking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>carrying things out and it's just,</v>

2941
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:30.680
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was just deep in the web of</v>

2942
02:15:30.681 --> 02:15:31.760
<v Speaker 4>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2943
02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:34.520
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see anybody like that when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're young because you grew up in a</v>

2944
02:15:34.521 --> 02:15:35.390
<v Speaker 4>rough neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2945
02:15:35.850 --> 02:15:36.720
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2946
02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:39.120
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm actually very close to somebody who,</v>

2947
02:15:39.270 --> 02:15:41.930
<v Speaker 5>who am I?</v>
<v Speaker 5>My oldest brother uh,</v>

2948
02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:47.720
<v Speaker 5>became a slowly over time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a big alcoholic and he's been a three</v>

2949
02:15:48.211 --> 02:15:51.960
<v Speaker 5>months sober now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a miracle.</v>

2950
02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:56.100
<v Speaker 5>Like it's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And because it seemed like he was never</v>

2951
02:15:56.101 --> 02:16:01.101
<v Speaker 5>going to stop and when he stopped</v>
<v Speaker 5>drinking he was shaking so</v>

2952
02:16:01.861 --> 02:16:05.220
<v Speaker 5>uncontrollably that he had to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He couldn't even walk.</v>

2953
02:16:05.730 --> 02:16:08.160
<v Speaker 5>He would just fall down and he's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>strong guy.</v>

2954
02:16:08.161 --> 02:16:11.880
<v Speaker 5>This is a guy who like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember going to Venice beach with</v>

2955
02:16:11.881 --> 02:16:15.330
<v Speaker 5>them when I came and visited,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just to check this place out when I was</v>

2956
02:16:15.331 --> 02:16:16.890
<v Speaker 5>18 to visit our other brother.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>

2957
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:19.140
<v Speaker 5>me and my other,</v>
<v Speaker 5>me and my brother came out to visit our</v>

2958
02:16:19.141 --> 02:16:23.250
<v Speaker 5>brother that lived here and they played</v>
<v Speaker 5>basketball on Venice beach and they were</v>

2959
02:16:23.251 --> 02:16:26.910
<v Speaker 5>just balling all over everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he's an amazing athlete and this</v>

2960
02:16:26.911 --> 02:16:28.680
<v Speaker 5>and that and what he was doing that he</v>
<v Speaker 5>was drinking.</v>

2961
02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but even still on that,</v>

2962
02:16:30.071 --> 02:16:32.230
<v Speaker 5>he was drinking at night.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not during the,</v>

2963
02:16:32.310 --> 02:16:33.190
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2964
02:16:33.220 --> 02:16:34.600
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they were drinking during the day too.</v>

2965
02:16:34.601 --> 02:16:37.570
<v Speaker 5>It was so much booze that his body was</v>
<v Speaker 5>just completely hooked on it.</v>

2966
02:16:37.630 --> 02:16:42.630
<v Speaker 5>Totally Day every single day and night</v>
<v Speaker 5>because he was a professional bartender</v>

2967
02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:44.440
<v Speaker 5>and in Columbus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Columbus,</v>

2968
02:16:44.441 --> 02:16:49.160
<v Speaker 5>Ohio even has a big drinking culture,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like huge drinking culture park.</v>

2969
02:16:49.180 --> 02:16:51.710
<v Speaker 5>Europe does huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

2970
02:16:51.790 --> 02:16:55.210
<v Speaker 5>he was like at the helm of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like the head bartender at all the</v>

2971
02:16:55.211 --> 02:17:00.211
<v Speaker 5>best places in Columbus over the past 20</v>
<v Speaker 5>years or whatever and that even Columbus</v>

2972
02:17:01.181 --> 02:17:03.340
<v Speaker 5>as a culture for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But also I don't think a lot of people</v>

2973
02:17:03.341 --> 02:17:05.860
<v Speaker 5>know that the restaurant industry has a</v>
<v Speaker 5>real,</v>

2974
02:17:05.861 --> 02:17:07.360
<v Speaker 5>real,</v>
<v Speaker 5>real culture for it.</v>

2975
02:17:07.450 --> 02:17:11.680
<v Speaker 5>Everybody that works in fine dining</v>
<v Speaker 5>restaurants goes out and gets shit faced</v>

2976
02:17:11.681 --> 02:17:12.700
<v Speaker 5>every year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like 80,</v>

2977
02:17:12.701 --> 02:17:16.240
<v Speaker 5>90 percent of the people because you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>taking care of people all the time.</v>

2978
02:17:16.660 --> 02:17:18.250
<v Speaker 5>You need to get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need to.</v>

2979
02:17:18.251 --> 02:17:20.800
<v Speaker 5>You need to go get treated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They walk in shot beer,</v>

2980
02:17:20.801 --> 02:17:23.440
<v Speaker 5>shot beer and then starting with</v>
<v Speaker 5>restaurant workers.</v>

2981
02:17:23.441 --> 02:17:24.130
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huge,</v>

2982
02:17:24.130 --> 02:17:25.600
<v Speaker 5>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jeff's waitresses,</v>

2983
02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:29.200
<v Speaker 5>bartenders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>huge culture of it and I'm sure Barnes</v>

2984
02:17:29.201 --> 02:17:30.850
<v Speaker 5>worth has to get liquored up once in a</v>
<v Speaker 5>while.</v>

2985
02:17:30.851 --> 02:17:32.380
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Barnes worth probably does.</v>

2986
02:17:32.381 --> 02:17:36.580
<v Speaker 5>Estrogen locks the door and just takes</v>
<v Speaker 5>extra shots,</v>

2987
02:17:37.870 --> 02:17:39.460
<v Speaker 5>drinks it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

2988
02:17:39.461 --> 02:17:40.360
<v Speaker 5>to watch my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2989
02:17:40.361 --> 02:17:43.540
<v Speaker 5>physically powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A brother will not watch,</v>

2990
02:17:43.541 --> 02:17:46.300
<v Speaker 5>but I heard about it because he's in</v>
<v Speaker 5>Columbus and I'm here,</v>

2991
02:17:46.301 --> 02:17:48.310
<v Speaker 5>but those dark.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But luckily he's.</v>

2992
02:17:48.430 --> 02:17:50.860
<v Speaker 5>He's doing really good three months</v>
<v Speaker 5>sober,</v>

2993
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:53.770
<v Speaker 5>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you would've told me three months ago</v>

2994
02:17:53.771 --> 02:17:55.530
<v Speaker 5>that he had actually stopped drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2995
02:17:55.531 --> 02:17:57.190
<v Speaker 5>I've gotTa said that's very hard to do.</v>

2996
02:17:57.250 --> 02:18:00.790
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if mushrooms were legal and if</v>
<v Speaker 6>they had real treatment centers,</v>

2997
02:18:00.820 --> 02:18:03.550
<v Speaker 6>how many people would be curative</v>
<v Speaker 6>diseases like that.</v>

2998
02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:05.710
<v Speaker 6>I want to say diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 6>addictions like that.</v>

2999
02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:07.790
<v Speaker 6>How many people would be cured of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3000
02:18:08.170 --> 02:18:11.410
<v Speaker 6>a lot of different things that they've</v>
<v Speaker 6>been struggling with psychologically,</v>

3001
02:18:11.530 --> 02:18:14.440
<v Speaker 6>if they could use Ibogaine here in</v>
<v Speaker 6>America,</v>

3002
02:18:14.470 --> 02:18:18.280
<v Speaker 6>which is super effective in Mexico and a</v>
<v Speaker 6>lot of other countries where it's legal,</v>

3003
02:18:18.281 --> 02:18:20.410
<v Speaker 6>where they use it for treatment for</v>
<v Speaker 6>addictive diseases.</v>

3004
02:18:20.530 --> 02:18:24.970
<v Speaker 6>It's supposed to be incredible for</v>
<v Speaker 6>kicking people off of pills and opiates</v>

3005
02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:28.720
<v Speaker 6>re literally reprograms your addictive</v>
<v Speaker 6>tendencies in your system.</v>

3006
02:18:28.721 --> 02:18:31.660
<v Speaker 6>Somehow with molly,</v>
<v Speaker 6>molly,</v>

3007
02:18:32.050 --> 02:18:34.900
<v Speaker 6>molly related,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they said that too about ptsd for</v>

3008
02:18:34.901 --> 02:18:36.850
<v Speaker 6>soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That molly's giant for that</v>

3009
02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:40.010
<v Speaker 5>the government paid for tests on</v>
<v Speaker 5>psilocybin.</v>

3010
02:18:40.011 --> 02:18:44.900
<v Speaker 5>It like Carnegie or Harvard or Cornell</v>
<v Speaker 5>or some stuff and they kept finding that</v>

3011
02:18:44.901 --> 02:18:49.901
<v Speaker 5>it cured chronic depression on people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that like they had given up and just</v>

3012
02:18:49.911 --> 02:18:51.020
<v Speaker 5>said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's for life.</v>

3013
02:18:51.021 --> 02:18:53.220
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be depressed for life</v>
<v Speaker 5>programs.</v>

3014
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:58.050
<v Speaker 5>Totally see why I'm reprograms your</v>
<v Speaker 5>brain apps.</v>

3015
02:18:58.070 --> 02:19:01.040
<v Speaker 5>It's like a shower for your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when everything's just too</v>

3016
02:19:01.041 --> 02:19:04.220
<v Speaker 5>cluttered and dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the only real analogy that I think</v>

3017
02:19:04.250 --> 02:19:06.740
<v Speaker 5>is effective for mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a brain shower.</v>

3018
02:19:07.390 --> 02:19:11.750
<v Speaker 5>It did this thing that I absolutely love</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I found out about a couple of years</v>

3019
02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:14.990
<v Speaker 5>ago called Neti Pot,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know about that run warm water</v>

3020
02:19:14.991 --> 02:19:18.650
<v Speaker 5>through your nasal passage and it's the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same thing like I think to myself every</v>

3021
02:19:18.651 --> 02:19:20.750
<v Speaker 5>time I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like I can't believe people don't know</v>

3022
02:19:20.751 --> 02:19:22.670
<v Speaker 5>about this because you know the squeeze</v>
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>

3023
02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:23.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what I have.</v>

3024
02:19:24.220 --> 02:19:26.000
<v Speaker 5>That's what I have for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Blasted up there.</v>

3025
02:19:26.030 --> 02:19:27.800
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd be was crazy.</v>

3026
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:31.700
<v Speaker 4>I remember I used to use that when I had</v>
<v Speaker 4>my nose operation when I had my nose</v>

3027
02:19:31.701 --> 02:19:34.730
<v Speaker 4>chewed open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a really bad scar tissue inside my</v>

3028
02:19:34.731 --> 02:19:38.320
<v Speaker 4>nose and I had a deviated septum and a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of the scar tissue was like a.</v>

3029
02:19:38.450 --> 02:19:41.750
<v Speaker 4>It comes calcified because if you've</v>
<v Speaker 4>been hitting the nose a few times,</v>

3030
02:19:41.751 --> 02:19:44.600
<v Speaker 4>if it bleeds inside your nose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like cauliflower ear,</v>

3031
02:19:44.690 --> 02:19:47.110
<v Speaker 4>but inside your nose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a cutaway.</v>

3032
02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:51.140
<v Speaker 4>All this different tissue and open up</v>
<v Speaker 4>this passage and then to clean it,</v>

3033
02:19:51.141 --> 02:19:54.020
<v Speaker 4>I used to use a waterpik so it squirt</v>
<v Speaker 4>the water,</v>

3034
02:19:54.021 --> 02:19:57.710
<v Speaker 4>pick up one nostril and it'd be pouring</v>
<v Speaker 4>out the other nostril and I would blow</v>

3035
02:19:57.711 --> 02:20:02.390
<v Speaker 4>out these fucking titanic boogers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They looked like they were from another</v>

3036
02:20:02.391 --> 02:20:04.520
<v Speaker 4>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were giant and covered in blood</v>

3037
02:20:04.730 --> 02:20:07.490
<v Speaker 4>and they were like the size of a thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they would come out and I would</v>

3038
02:20:07.491 --> 02:20:08.324
<v Speaker 4>treasure them.</v>

3039
02:20:08.510 --> 02:20:10.250
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want everybody to see this.</v>

3040
02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:14.170
<v Speaker 4>It was like at your Dick pic back in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>day I showed.</v>

3041
02:20:14.990 --> 02:20:17.830
<v Speaker 4>I opened up the Napkin Forum,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did Tom's cigar and he went</v>

3042
02:20:20.980 --> 02:20:22.820
<v Speaker 4>over in the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll never forget it.</v>

3043
02:20:23.180 --> 02:20:23.841
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

3044
02:20:23.841 --> 02:20:26.330
<v Speaker 4>I just fucking blew the most insane</v>
<v Speaker 4>booger out of my nose.</v>

3045
02:20:26.331 --> 02:20:27.051
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you want to see it?</v>

3046
02:20:27.051 --> 02:20:27.760
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>AH,</v>

3047
02:20:27.760 --> 02:20:31.930
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll open it up and it's like this.</v>

3048
02:20:32.060 --> 02:20:35.660
<v Speaker 4>It's like rubber cement glue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like as you pull the page on the side</v>

3049
02:20:35.661 --> 02:20:39.560
<v Speaker 4>that the Burger was so big that it just</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't seem like it come out of a human.</v>

3050
02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:44.640
<v Speaker 4>Didn't make any sense and he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately have.</v>

3051
02:20:45.521 --> 02:20:47.060
<v Speaker 4>You have to get that done though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>folks,</v>

3052
02:20:47.061 --> 02:20:49.400
<v Speaker 4>if you find a good doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know some people have had bad</v>

3053
02:20:49.401 --> 02:20:52.310
<v Speaker 4>experiences with a doctor that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>really know what they're doing.</v>

3054
02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:56.540
<v Speaker 4>That was a life changer for me to get my</v>
<v Speaker 4>nose cleaned up so I could breathe</v>

3055
02:20:57.440 --> 02:20:58.580
<v Speaker 5>in Neti pot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3056
02:20:58.610 --> 02:20:59.040
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3057
02:20:59.040 --> 02:21:01.200
<v Speaker 5>you got to do it right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gotta make sure you put the packet</v>

3058
02:21:01.201 --> 02:21:03.390
<v Speaker 5>in and use distilled water and warm it</v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

3059
02:21:03.391 --> 02:21:05.310
<v Speaker 5>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of those things too where when</v>

3060
02:21:05.311 --> 02:21:06.360
<v Speaker 5>I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

3061
02:21:06.420 --> 02:21:08.340
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tonight's going to be a good night.</v>

3062
02:21:08.420 --> 02:21:09.570
<v Speaker 4>It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a broken nose,</v>

3063
02:21:09.571 --> 02:21:11.860
<v Speaker 4>that's still not going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If someone did,</v>

3064
02:21:11.880 --> 02:21:15.030
<v Speaker 4>you need to get that operation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have a deviated septum so you</v>

3065
02:21:15.031 --> 02:21:17.640
<v Speaker 4>can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really can't like do yoga correctly</v>

3066
02:21:17.730 --> 02:21:21.360
<v Speaker 4>without breathing in through your nose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It kept me from doing yoga a lot because</v>

3067
02:21:21.361 --> 02:21:22.720
<v Speaker 4>they would always tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to breathe that.</v>

3068
02:21:22.721 --> 02:21:23.400
<v Speaker 4>He knows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3069
02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:25.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't have one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't.</v>

3070
02:21:25.091 --> 02:21:27.960
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could smell a few things,</v>

3071
02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:31.830
<v Speaker 4>but it's just jacked in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so Neti pots wouldn't have worked.</v>

3072
02:21:31.890 --> 02:21:33.300
<v Speaker 4>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just wouldn't have worked,</v>

3073
02:21:33.450 --> 02:21:35.190
<v Speaker 4>but now that it's clean works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

3074
02:21:35.450 --> 02:21:38.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so salt water to pour those little salt</v>

3075
02:21:38.761 --> 02:21:42.150
<v Speaker 4>packets in the water and shake it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's my favorite fucking thing.</v>

3076
02:21:42.210 --> 02:21:44.760
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever find yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you bend over to tie your shoes</v>

3077
02:21:44.761 --> 02:21:47.610
<v Speaker 4>like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an hour later and some water leaks out</v>

3078
02:21:47.611 --> 02:21:50.970
<v Speaker 4>of your nose a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where the fuck was that water hide in</v>

3079
02:21:50.971 --> 02:21:54.330
<v Speaker 4>the corner of a hole in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe store in water.</v>

3080
02:21:54.630 --> 02:21:56.520
<v Speaker 4>Like I bent over to tie my shoes and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

3081
02:21:56.521 --> 02:21:58.200
<v Speaker 4>what is this drip drip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drip,</v>

3082
02:21:58.201 --> 02:21:58.561
<v Speaker 4>drip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drip,</v>

3083
02:21:58.561 --> 02:21:58.921
<v Speaker 4>drip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drip.</v>

3084
02:21:58.921 --> 02:21:59.260
<v Speaker 4>Drip</v>

3085
02:21:59.260 --> 02:22:02.190
<v Speaker 5>happened to me during that set,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like just one little drop,</v>

3086
02:22:02.191 --> 02:22:03.870
<v Speaker 5>but that's that last night when that</v>
<v Speaker 5>ladies like,</v>

3087
02:22:03.871 --> 02:22:04.620
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3088
02:22:04.620 --> 02:22:07.980
<v Speaker 5>you're never going to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It came out of nowhere like bloop and</v>

3089
02:22:07.981 --> 02:22:08.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You get it gives grab someone like that</v>

3091
02:22:11.161 --> 02:22:14.070
<v Speaker 4>and take them out of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't interrupt the show like that.</v>

3092
02:22:14.071 --> 02:22:17.060
<v Speaker 4>That's so stupid because that's one</v>
<v Speaker 4>person that the Irvine Improv,</v>

3093
02:22:17.100 --> 02:22:21.120
<v Speaker 4>500 people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's one person deciding that in 500</v>

3094
02:22:21.121 --> 02:22:24.240
<v Speaker 4>people that I'm sure a giant percentage</v>
<v Speaker 4>of more laughing because I know the bits</v>

3095
02:22:24.241 --> 02:22:25.074
<v Speaker 4>hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That's why like people were booing her</v>

3097
02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:32.650
<v Speaker 4>before I even said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's your problem lady like it was</v>

3098
02:22:32.690 --> 02:22:36.420
<v Speaker 4>just can't have to deal with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just people don't get it because they</v>

3099
02:22:36.421 --> 02:22:37.860
<v Speaker 4>look at you and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's just talking,</v>

3100
02:22:37.940 --> 02:22:38.761
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>

3101
02:22:38.761 --> 02:22:40.620
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to make people in this room</v>

3102
02:22:40.621 --> 02:22:41.850
<v Speaker 4>vote for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3103
02:22:41.851 --> 02:22:44.460
<v Speaker 4>no lady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're the only one that's not realizing</v>

3104
02:22:44.461 --> 02:22:46.320
<v Speaker 4>that you're at a professional show right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

3105
02:22:46.600 --> 02:22:47.520
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only that,</v>

3106
02:22:47.730 --> 02:22:50.970
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how weak is your candidate.</v>

3107
02:22:51.090 --> 02:22:53.200
<v Speaker 4>A comedian could talk you out of it and</v>
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>

3108
02:22:54.210 --> 02:22:57.570
<v Speaker 4>fuck these poor people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bernie Sanders is an old loser.</v>

3109
02:22:57.910 --> 02:23:01.170
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think trump really wants to be</v>

3110
02:23:01.171 --> 02:23:03.990
<v Speaker 4>president because it seems like he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be.</v>

3111
02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:06.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not bullshitting people like you're</v>

3112
02:23:06.841 --> 02:23:07.770
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're wrong.</v>

3113
02:23:08.910 --> 02:23:11.400
<v Speaker 4>He is way out ahead on the republican</v>
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>

3114
02:23:11.500 --> 02:23:13.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and more people are willing to vote</v>

3115
02:23:13.381 --> 02:23:15.480
<v Speaker 4>Republican now than before Obama was in</v>
<v Speaker 4>office.</v>

3116
02:23:15.481 --> 02:23:18.390
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that have</v>
<v Speaker 4>strengthened the resolve against</v>

3117
02:23:18.391 --> 02:23:22.110
<v Speaker 4>liberals and against the left and</v>
<v Speaker 4>against the Democratic Party.</v>

3118
02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:23.910
<v Speaker 4>It's highly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he just.</v>

3119
02:23:24.330 --> 02:23:26.790
<v Speaker 4>If he just changes his tune on a few</v>
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>

3120
02:23:27.900 --> 02:23:30.150
<v Speaker 4>he could get me know if he needs to</v>
<v Speaker 4>change his tune.</v>

3121
02:23:30.180 --> 02:23:34.410
<v Speaker 4>He's saying stuff that I think a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are thinking.</v>

3122
02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:37.140
<v Speaker 4>That's one of my alien bugger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

3123
02:23:37.770 --> 02:23:40.890
<v Speaker 4>that's a bugger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a bugger isn't it?</v>

3124
02:23:40.891 --> 02:23:42.780
<v Speaker 4>Looked like a cockroach nest or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

3125
02:23:43.380 --> 02:23:46.320
<v Speaker 4>So look at my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Looks like one of the planets from Star</v>

3126
02:23:46.320 --> 02:23:50.090
<v Speaker 4>Wars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at my hand here to wean the thing</v>

3127
02:23:50.110 --> 02:23:54.450
<v Speaker 4>that you can get a good because that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>the kind of a inflated picture,</v>

3128
02:23:54.540 --> 02:23:56.150
<v Speaker 4>but you could see how big that was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like that,</v>

3129
02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:59.710
<v Speaker 4>but that is a real booger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That and that was a little dry like it</v>

3130
02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:02.100
<v Speaker 4>when it came out like maybe a minute or</v>
<v Speaker 4>two before that.</v>

3131
02:24:02.101 --> 02:24:07.101
<v Speaker 4>It was a little larger that when you had</v>
<v Speaker 4>that crazy shit the other day and you're</v>

3132
02:24:07.381 --> 02:24:09.270
<v Speaker 4>like pushing your kids out of your way</v>
<v Speaker 4>and everything,</v>

3133
02:24:09.271 --> 02:24:10.940
<v Speaker 4>do you remember what you ate or what</v>
<v Speaker 4>causes?</v>

3134
02:24:12.020 --> 02:24:14.730
<v Speaker 4>My God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the one that made Tommy gag</v>

3135
02:24:16.740 --> 02:24:19.740
<v Speaker 4>because that's the one that made Tommy</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gaggs God.</v>

3136
02:24:19.890 --> 02:24:24.570
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took a photo of it in the bathroom.</v>

3137
02:24:24.571 --> 02:24:28.920
<v Speaker 4>Then I put it in a Napkin and I brought</v>
<v Speaker 4>it out to them that weren't really.</v>

3138
02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:32.190
<v Speaker 4>Is that something else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did you ask?</v>

3139
02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:34.590
<v Speaker 4>What did you just ask?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What made that crazy shit that you're</v>

3140
02:24:34.591 --> 02:24:36.500
<v Speaker 4>talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oil.</v>

3141
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:41.870
<v Speaker 4>Pretty sure I had too much mct oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you put too much mct oil in a kale</v>

3142
02:24:42.271 --> 02:24:43.950
<v Speaker 4>shake or a protein shake or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

3143
02:24:43.980 --> 02:24:45.630
<v Speaker 4>Occasionally there's like a tipping</v>
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>

3144
02:24:45.870 --> 02:24:48.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't know like how many cups is like</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should probably figure out like what's</v>

3145
02:24:48.731 --> 02:24:53.040
<v Speaker 4>a beneficial dose instead of just adding</v>
<v Speaker 4>cap foals and I might have added an</v>

3146
02:24:53.041 --> 02:24:57.690
<v Speaker 4>extra cap full and I might have drinking</v>
<v Speaker 4>much more than I usually drank and a</v>

3147
02:24:57.691 --> 02:25:02.540
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was the fucking click,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sear snapped and the fuck.</v>

3148
02:25:02.610 --> 02:25:06.840
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's funny,</v>

3149
02:25:06.841 --> 02:25:08.940
<v Speaker 4>Max,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have five year olds,</v>

3150
02:25:08.941 --> 02:25:11.850
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to hear nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't say the house is on fire,</v>

3151
02:25:11.851 --> 02:25:13.890
<v Speaker 4>but Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't find my toy.</v>

3152
02:25:14.030 --> 02:25:16.740
<v Speaker 4>Like whatever they're dealing with is</v>
<v Speaker 4>like so critically important.</v>

3153
02:25:16.741 --> 02:25:17.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to get it.</v>

3154
02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:19.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to shit on you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many shit.</v>

3155
02:25:19.231 --> 02:25:21.810
<v Speaker 4>I knew your faces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where my ass is.</v>

3156
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:22.663
<v Speaker 4>You've got to get out of.</v>

3157
02:25:25.370 --> 02:25:28.320
<v Speaker 5>Can't stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I was with all my bike,</v>

3158
02:25:28.350 --> 02:25:31.740
<v Speaker 5>my bike.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was tightening up a massive crowds</v>

3159
02:25:32.070 --> 02:25:35.290
<v Speaker 5>squat you've ever done in your life</v>
<v Speaker 5>counts for this moment.</v>

3160
02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:37.960
<v Speaker 5>The cramps when I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh no,</v>

3161
02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:40.630
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if we're going to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was that moment where I was like,</v>

3162
02:25:40.631 --> 02:25:42.340
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to shit at least a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my pants.</v>

3163
02:25:42.490 --> 02:25:46.220
<v Speaker 5>Maybe we'll just let the prisoners out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A few hostages out.</v>

3164
02:25:46.221 --> 02:25:48.220
<v Speaker 5>And then we renegotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once I get to the bathroom,</v>

3165
02:25:48.970 --> 02:25:52.720
<v Speaker 4>I managed to keep it together just right</v>
<v Speaker 4>to that point where I was born.</v>

3166
02:25:53.500 --> 02:25:53.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3167
02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:57.210
<v Speaker 5>Can you just hear Mike Goldberg's voice?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's all over.</v>

3168
02:25:58.720 --> 02:25:59.960
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mct oil though.</v>

3169
02:25:59.961 --> 02:26:02.120
<v Speaker 4>We'll make you shit yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3170
02:26:02.180 --> 02:26:04.010
<v Speaker 4>you have to be careful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have too much of it.</v>

3171
02:26:04.100 --> 02:26:07.100
<v Speaker 4>It will definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just lives up the old pipes and just</v>

3172
02:26:07.130 --> 02:26:10.130
<v Speaker 4>releases the hounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's probably a good thing because</v>

3173
02:26:10.131 --> 02:26:12.640
<v Speaker 4>once it goes through like a blast out</v>
<v Speaker 4>boy feel.</v>

3174
02:26:13.080 --> 02:26:17.580
<v Speaker 5>I've been taking healthier poops than</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever lately with this new meat in flux.</v>

3175
02:26:17.581 --> 02:26:22.400
<v Speaker 5>My body is just loving it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're so solid that every time now,</v>

3176
02:26:22.401 --> 02:26:24.490
<v Speaker 5>every time I take a poop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know when the.</v>

3177
02:26:24.670 --> 02:26:28.460
<v Speaker 5>When you get the splash back to I'm at.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm at $100.</v>

3178
02:26:28.670 --> 02:26:32.030
<v Speaker 5>I get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm at 100 percent slash back now.</v>

3179
02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:34.610
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever gone back?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever had your Bible Open up</v>

3180
02:26:34.611 --> 02:26:36.760
<v Speaker 5>enough?</v>

<v Speaker 4>I think there's a place in Burbank</v>

3224
02:28:19.151 --> 02:28:20.470
<v Speaker 4>called pecan yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the same,</v>

3225

<v Speaker 4>these pitchforks with meat on them.</v>

3229
02:28:28.821 --> 02:28:30.950
<v Speaker 4>These skewers with meat on them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>slice it off.</v>

3230
02:28:31.010 --> 02:28:32.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it in front of an open fire.</v>

3235
02:28:44.620 --> 02:28:48.320
<v Speaker 4>Now they slowly cook it so good.</v>

3237
02:28:50.751 --> 02:28:52.640
<v Speaker 4>plate and then they go back to cooking</v>
<v Speaker 4>it again.</v>

3238
02:28:52.970 --> 02:28:56.900
<v Speaker 4>Like they based it again with their</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever they have that it's like a salt</v>

3239
02:28:56.901 --> 02:29:01.250
<v Speaker 4>and some sort of an oil to it and bred</v>

<v Speaker 5>He was there that night.</v>

3368
02:34:24.901 --> 02:34:25.750
<v Speaker 5>In fact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3369
02:34:25.810 --> 02:34:28.410
<v Speaker 5>fun fact about that is if you noticed</v>
<v Speaker 5>when we saw the trailer,</v>

3370
02:34:28.411 --> 02:34:30.330
<v Speaker 5>there was one guy that's sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 5>walked off.</v>

3371
02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:31.950
<v Speaker 5>That's Shawn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which I think is so cool.</v>

3372
02:34:31.951 --> 02:34:34.020
<v Speaker 5>It's like a perfect little tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tiny,</v>

3373
02:34:34.021 --> 02:34:36.330
<v Speaker 5>tiny cameo you have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'd have to really pause it at the</v>

3374
02:34:36.331 --> 02:34:39.330
<v Speaker 5>right moment to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he was so responsible for it</v>

3375
02:34:39.331 --> 02:34:40.730
<v Speaker 5>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

3376
02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:41.700
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what was the question?</v>

3377
02:34:41.700 --> 02:34:43.240
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Being comfortable with the ice houses</v>

3378
02:34:43.260 --> 02:34:46.140
<v Speaker 5>with the two weeks notice that I had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I literally,</v>

3379
02:34:46.141 --> 02:34:51.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even kidding or exaggerating in</v>
<v Speaker 5>my dreams at night was envisioning it</v>

3380
02:34:51.001 --> 02:34:51.910
<v Speaker 5>and I'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3381
02:34:51.980 --> 02:34:54.740
<v Speaker 5>it would be a nightmare or a great dream</v>
<v Speaker 5>depending on.</v>

3382
02:34:55.250 --> 02:34:58.200
<v Speaker 5>But I was like picturing it and during</v>
<v Speaker 5>the day I was picturing it and where I</v>

3383
02:34:58.201 --> 02:35:00.930
<v Speaker 5>wanted the steady cam to be because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3384
02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:02.790
<v Speaker 5>Ben Wolfensohn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my really good friend,</v>

3385
02:35:02.791 --> 02:35:07.791
<v Speaker 5>amazing director directed the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a Ari Shaffir special and uh,</v>

3386
02:35:08.220 --> 02:35:10.980
<v Speaker 5>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>trip tank on comedy central.</v>

3387
02:35:12.060 --> 02:35:12.893
<v Speaker 5>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3388
02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:15.840
<v Speaker 5>this was my idea of shooting it all in</v>
<v Speaker 5>one shot.</v>

3389
02:35:15.890 --> 02:35:18.440
<v Speaker 4>It's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a great way to also to capitalize</v>

3390
02:35:18.441 --> 02:35:19.310
<v Speaker 4>on that small club.</v>

3391
02:35:20.190 --> 02:35:20.731
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3392
02:35:20.731 --> 02:35:23.970
<v Speaker 5>I knew I had to do something special</v>
<v Speaker 5>that really stand out,</v>

3393
02:35:24.030 --> 02:35:25.620
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I don't have,</v>

3394
02:35:25.700 --> 02:35:28.050
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tv fame or anything like that.</v>

3395
02:35:28.051 --> 02:35:29.320
<v Speaker 5>That's so many,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3396
02:35:29.500 --> 02:35:31.140
<v Speaker 5>networks and everything</v>

3397
02:35:31.180 --> 02:35:34.420
<v Speaker 4>looks for anything that anybody's going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to view it based on the fact that you</v>

3398
02:35:34.421 --> 02:35:36.030
<v Speaker 4>shot in one shot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

3399
02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:39.380
<v Speaker 5>more people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's why they got it.</v>

3400
02:35:39.410 --> 02:35:40.730
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

02:35:57.801 --> 02:36:01.820
<v Speaker 4>comedians that have heat behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another thing that I'm so honored</v>

3412
02:36:01.880 --> 02:36:03.230
<v Speaker 4>to be up there with Sigur.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3413
02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:06.710
<v Speaker 4>you know who joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's came out two weeks ago and is</v>

3414
02:36:06.711 --> 02:36:08.810
<v Speaker 4>amazing and everything about it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing.</v>

3415
02:36:08.930 --> 02:36:12.080
<v Speaker 4>This whole fucking national persona</v>
<v Speaker 4>changed.</v>

3416
02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:14.090
<v Speaker 4>Like people really became aware of who</v>
<v Speaker 4>barry.</v>

3417
02:36:14.290 --> 02:36:17.750
<v Speaker 4>His paper was always like peeking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was always like ramping up,</v>

3418
02:36:17.751 --> 02:36:19.070
<v Speaker 4>becoming more and more famous every</v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

3419
02:36:19.071 --> 02:36:22.670
<v Speaker 4>But once his netflix special came out</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was probably his best special to</v>

3420
02:36:22.671 --> 02:36:25.820
<v Speaker 4>date,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just smashed it and then became a guy</v>

3421
02:36:25.821 --> 02:36:27.500
<v Speaker 4>who sold out Madison Square Garden and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3422
02:36:27.530 --> 02:36:29.330
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that easily can happen to you.</v>

3423
02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:32.180
<v Speaker 4>It could happen as a girl to cigars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>New special is even better than his</v>

3424
02:36:32.181 --> 02:36:34.370
<v Speaker 4>other one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking smashing it right now.</v>

<v Speaker 5>where like that can happen.</v>

3428

<v Speaker 4>the best ones we ever did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was fucking hilarious.</v>

02:38:18.580 --> 02:38:20.260
<v Speaker 5>He really is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And He,</v>

3469
02:38:20.320 --> 02:38:21.910
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's just the best.</v>

3470

<v Speaker 5>me some cool advice and just is a great,</v>

3471
02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:28.890
<v Speaker 5>great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he and I,</v>

3472
02:38:28.930 --> 02:38:31.990
<v Speaker 5>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this netflix thing is also like a</v>

3473
02:38:31.991 --> 02:38:34.130
<v Speaker 5>different path.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

3474
02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:36.580
<v Speaker 5>it's unchartered territory and he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>helping me out.</v>

3475
02:38:36.581 --> 02:38:40.060
<v Speaker 5>Being like a cool big brother that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>awesome to me is this whole thing</v>

3476
02:38:40.270 --> 02:38:41.560
<v Speaker 5>happens and unfolds.</v>

3477
02:38:42.020 --> 02:38:44.780
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't be luckier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were so lucky that something like</v>

3478
02:38:44.781 --> 02:38:48.350
<v Speaker 4>Netflix exists because if you do a</v>
<v Speaker 4>special on anything else,</v>

3479
02:38:48.351 --> 02:38:51.540
<v Speaker 4>like say if you do an HBO special,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they aerate whenever they aerate.</v>

3480
02:38:52.030 --> 02:38:53.750
<v Speaker 4>They might hear at once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might have it twice,</v>

3481
02:38:53.751 --> 02:38:56.630
<v Speaker 4>they might erode a few other times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might air it randomly 3:00 in the</v>

3482
02:38:56.631 --> 02:39:00.770
<v Speaker 4>morning on some special night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But with Netflix it's always there.</v>

3483
02:39:00.771 --> 02:39:03.020
<v Speaker 4>You just press start,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just press play.</v>

3484
02:39:03.260 --> 02:39:04.190
<v Speaker 4>That's the secret.</v>

3485
02:39:04.230 --> 02:39:09.230
<v Speaker 5>That's everything with their amazing</v>
<v Speaker 5>algorithms that people that would like</v>

3486
02:39:09.361 --> 02:39:11.280
<v Speaker 5>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are going to get a shot at it.</v>

3487
02:39:11.281 --> 02:39:14.460
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody has a different screen when</v>

3488
02:39:14.461 --> 02:39:17.880
<v Speaker 5>they turn theirs on based on what they</v>
<v Speaker 5>watched and if they liked it and if they</v>

3489
02:39:17.881 --> 02:39:19.740
<v Speaker 5>rated it and even if you don't rate</v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

3490
02:39:19.741 --> 02:39:23.280
<v Speaker 5>it's still knows you that their</v>
<v Speaker 5>algorithm is like world world,</v>

3491
02:39:23.281 --> 02:39:25.200
<v Speaker 5>world class.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really interesting.</v>

3492
02:39:25.201 --> 02:39:30.201
<v Speaker 5>So the more that people would like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the closer you're going to get to their</v>

3493
02:39:30.780 --> 02:39:31.830
<v Speaker 5>front page.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So</v>

3494
02:39:31.890 --> 02:39:32.723
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

3495
02:39:33.150 --> 02:39:36.300
<v Speaker 8>I didn't know there's the ratings on</v>
<v Speaker 8>Netflix movies,</v>

3496
02:39:36.510 --> 02:39:38.400
<v Speaker 8>like if it says like four stars or</v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever,</v>

3497
02:39:38.580 --> 02:39:40.190
<v Speaker 8>that's not actually the rating or the</v>
<v Speaker 8>mood.</v>

3498
02:39:40.191 --> 02:39:42.750
<v Speaker 8>It's what they think you would say the</v>
<v Speaker 8>rating is.</v>

3499
02:39:42.900 --> 02:39:43.521
<v Speaker 8>So like.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

3500
02:39:43.521 --> 02:39:45.480
<v Speaker 8>so like there was one movie I watched</v>
<v Speaker 8>the other day and I was like,</v>

3501
02:39:45.540 --> 02:39:47.970
<v Speaker 8>how has it half a star?</v>
<v Speaker 8>That movie sucks so bad,</v>

3502
02:39:47.971 --> 02:39:50.040
<v Speaker 8>but it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it has a half a star and I was like,</v>

3503
02:39:50.070 --> 02:39:51.060
<v Speaker 8>oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's.</v>

3504
02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:54.470
<v Speaker 8>If you look at somebody else's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it'd be like three stars and we'll.</v>

3505
02:39:54.590 --> 02:39:55.530
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I didn't know that.</v>

3506
02:39:55.710 --> 02:39:57.450
<v Speaker 8>That's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's really bizarre.</v>

3507
02:39:57.480 --> 02:40:00.750
<v Speaker 8>That doesn't seem like that doesn't seem</v>
<v Speaker 8>kosher.</v>

3508
02:40:01.230 --> 02:40:02.220
<v Speaker 8>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right.</v>

3509
02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:02.580
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3510
02:40:02.580 --> 02:40:04.610
<v Speaker 4>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A star system should be kind of like</v>

3511
02:40:04.611 --> 02:40:06.650
<v Speaker 4>what people think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they'd want it to get that to</v>

3512
02:40:06.651 --> 02:40:11.651
<v Speaker 4>avoid like a disgruntled person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like giving it like a really bad reviews</v>

3513
02:40:12.021 --> 02:40:14.430
<v Speaker 4>under a bunch of different fake names or</v>
<v Speaker 4>the opposite,</v>

3514
02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:17.010
<v Speaker 4>like maybe a company that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we've,</v>

3515
02:40:17.140 --> 02:40:20.760
<v Speaker 4>there's been that before where someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>put out an independent film and then</v>

3516
02:40:20.761 --> 02:40:25.620
<v Speaker 4>someone hacked into the itunes comments</v>
<v Speaker 4>section and it's all just overwhelmingly</v>

3517
02:40:25.621 --> 02:40:28.920
<v Speaker 4>positive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like fake reviews of this terrible</v>

3518
02:40:28.921 --> 02:40:30.900
<v Speaker 4>fucking movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then someone in the comments,</v>

3519
02:40:30.901 --> 02:40:33.140
<v Speaker 4>we'll post.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are paid reviews.</v>

3520
02:40:33.141 --> 02:40:35.430
<v Speaker 4>Like this is not real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This movie's fucking terrible.</v>

3521
02:40:35.460 --> 02:40:36.293
<v Speaker 4>I've seen them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3522
02:40:36.370 --> 02:40:38.030
<v Speaker 4>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So maybe that's what Netflix,</v>

3523
02:40:38.050 --> 02:40:41.820
<v Speaker 4>trying to avoid rotten tomatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty guilty of that in general,</v>

3524
02:40:41.821 --> 02:40:44.770
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like there's some hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3525
02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:46.890
<v Speaker 4>it's hard when you've got a comment</v>
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>

3526
02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:48.120
<v Speaker 4>people don't hack it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3527
02:40:48.121 --> 02:40:50.340
<v Speaker 4>people like they've hacked itunes</v>
<v Speaker 4>ratings,</v>

3528
02:40:50.341 --> 02:40:54.000
<v Speaker 4>they figured out how to get higher</v>
<v Speaker 4>ratings and pretend they have more</v>

3529
02:40:54.001 --> 02:40:57.870
<v Speaker 4>downloads or have like multiple</v>
<v Speaker 4>different services that are like,</v>

3530
02:40:57.871 --> 02:41:01.330
<v Speaker 4>download your shit just to like juice up</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ratings and,</v>

3531
02:41:01.331 --> 02:41:06.331
<v Speaker 4>and add comments and like the algorithms</v>
<v Speaker 4>that someone like itunes has like easy</v>

3532
02:41:06.871 --> 02:41:09.510
<v Speaker 4>to manipulate because they're based on</v>
<v Speaker 4>downloads,</v>

3533
02:41:09.750 --> 02:41:12.930
<v Speaker 4>they're based on comments and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>based on New People.</v>

3534
02:41:13.020 --> 02:41:16.560
<v Speaker 4>So if you just have a bunch of new</v>
<v Speaker 4>people sign up and then they leave a</v>

3535
02:41:16.561 --> 02:41:20.190
<v Speaker 4>comment and they download it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll jump you up in the rankings.</v>

3536
02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:23.880
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of interesting how they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I guess you can only sign up for</v>

3537
02:41:23.881 --> 02:41:25.670
<v Speaker 4>itunes so many times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3538
02:41:25.980 --> 02:41:27.850
<v Speaker 4>So that's probably how they avoid it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3539
02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:30.900
<v Speaker 4>And it has your public name on their</v>
<v Speaker 4>side.</v>

3540
02:41:30.950 --> 02:41:33.660
<v Speaker 4>It's like even if you lose your account,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to be like,</v>

3541
02:41:33.960 --> 02:41:36.090
<v Speaker 4>this sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then have your real name on there.</v>

3542
02:41:36.150 --> 02:41:37.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3543
02:41:37.470 --> 02:41:39.270
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe itunes is the right way,</v>

3544
02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:42.570
<v Speaker 4>but it seems like the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3545
02:41:42.571 --> 02:41:45.930
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's anything like</v>

3546
02:41:46.140 --> 02:41:50.100
<v Speaker 4>Netflix might have a point there though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in your circle of people that you</v>

3547
02:41:50.101 --> 02:41:52.830

3548
02:41:52.831 --> 02:41:57.270
<v Speaker 4>wise versus in the circle of like 70</v>
<v Speaker 4>year old people that live in nursing</v>
