00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>that's what a real friend does right where you go,</v>

3
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

4
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.040
<v Speaker 1>I gotta actually reassess them.</v>

5
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6
00:00:06.441 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I love Michael Schirmer's quote,</v>

7
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Veuve read,</v>

8
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.720
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

11
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing myself a great disjustice injustice,</v>

12
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>but bring up Michael Shermer right now because I'll be a rape apologist because</v>

13
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know about this.</v>

14
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:20.501
<v Speaker 1>He was accused of,</v>

15
00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:20.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.640
<v Speaker 1>of doing something improper,</v>

17
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>improper meaning getting a girl drunk and having sex with her crazy that people</v>

18
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:29.820
<v Speaker 1>are calling that a lot of people are calling that rape now.</v>

19
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:30.654
<v Speaker 1>You never done that.</v>

20
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that happened.</v>

21
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened.</v>

22
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>You're drunk.</v>

23
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.960
<v Speaker 1>My point is I just needed to address,</v>

24
00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:36.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>just to put it out there.</v>

27
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>But the quote that is that he has is that a lot of people that are very smart,</v>

28
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>believed dump things because they can explain them and they can argue them very</v>

29
00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

30
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>And so they think they're doing well and winning in the argument.</v>

31
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>So that may be their point.</v>

32
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:52.104
<v Speaker 1>Makes Sense.</v>

33
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.110
<v Speaker 1>But it really becomes like a sort of circular ego argument.</v>

34
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Sounds,</v>

35
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.741
<v Speaker 2>sounds good.</v>

36
00:00:56.741 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 2>They've got a good sounding argument to be talked to like Michael Murphy and uh,</v>

37
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.870
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

38
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.340
<v Speaker 2>he's very eloquent.</v>

39
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

40
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.380
<v Speaker 2>It used to base a bit less eloquent.</v>

41
00:01:05.381 --> 00:01:05.860
<v Speaker 2>Now it's,</v>

42
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.693
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

43
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.670
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

44
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.560
<v Speaker 2>he's very convincing.</v>

45
00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:12.280
<v Speaker 2>He's very personable person and you can easily get sucked into things like that.</v>

46
00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:14.520
<v Speaker 2>And then you start repeating the same arguments yourself.</v>

47
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

48
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.830
<v Speaker 2>And you're convincing yourself because if you're an outgoing person,</v>

49
00:01:17.831 --> 00:01:19.060
<v Speaker 2>you're eloquent to yourself.</v>

50
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

51
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:24.590
<v Speaker 1>it's also in being a smart person and most of us are at least somewhat</v>

52
00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:26.300
<v Speaker 1>competitive that we want to be.</v>

53
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

54
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.750
<v Speaker 1>And it's what you were talking about earlier about certain skeptics being</v>

55
00:01:29.751 --> 00:01:33.110
<v Speaker 1>aggressive and they use skepticism as a game.</v>

56
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.720
<v Speaker 1>It Chow tallying up a social score.</v>

57
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

58
00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:40.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean it becomes a debate in the old fashioned sense of a debate where it's</v>

59
00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:41.800
<v Speaker 2>like one person has to argue this,</v>

60
00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:45.400
<v Speaker 2>the other person argues the opposite thing and then they fight it out and the</v>

61
00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:46.480
<v Speaker 2>best debater winds,</v>

62
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.440
<v Speaker 2>it becomes about debating rather than about finding what is true and what is not</v>

63
00:01:50.441 --> 00:01:51.274
<v Speaker 2>true.</v>

64
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:52.321
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

66
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>that is a real problem with being able to,</v>

67
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>to put it all aside and actually like look at what the fuck is really going on.</v>

68
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 2>They end up saying things that are wrong because the too hasty to come up with</v>

69
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 2>an explanation for things.</v>

70
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 2>So they'll end up like,</v>

71
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:02:09.151 --> 00:02:09.740
<v Speaker 2>just saying,</v>

73
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

74
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:10.410
<v Speaker 2>oh that's,</v>

75
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

76
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.620
<v Speaker 2>that's not a chem trail,</v>

77
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 2>that's a smoke from the planes just because it's the first thing that comes into</v>

78
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:19.560
<v Speaker 2>their head because the debunkers and they think that if they can think of</v>

79
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

80
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 2>they got that thing where they think they are intelligent and they are somewhat</v>

81
00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 2>intelligent,</v>

82
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 2>but people fool themselves as to how intelligent they actually are.</v>

83
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.190
<v Speaker 1>So even in debunkers can you caught their own deceit?</v>

84
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.970
<v Speaker 2>Very.</v>

85
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.820
<v Speaker 2>It's very annoying from my perspective as well because I get people coming onto</v>

86
00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:35.920
<v Speaker 2>my site and then they try to debunk things,</v>

87
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.950
<v Speaker 2>but they're,</v>

88
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.200
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

89
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.730
<v Speaker 2>they say things that are wrong scientifically wrong,</v>

90
00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:42.250
<v Speaker 2>and then you have to end up like correcting the debunkers as well.</v>

91
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.153
<v Speaker 1>Will that ever ends?</v>

92
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Conti debunkers fully agree.</v>

93
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.760
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of content goes quite a few,</v>

94
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

95
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:51.623
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

96
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.520
<v Speaker 1>It's easily today.</v>

97
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.720
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to be when you're also frustrated with your own vision of the world</v>

98
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>and then when someone comes along saying they have documented proof,</v>

99
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:03.650
<v Speaker 1>the loch ness monster is real and you're like the fuck you do shit shithead.</v>

100
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.103
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>

101
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

102
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.401
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say,</v>

103
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:06.870
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>

104

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

110
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>They don't have evidence.</v>

111
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>They have windows tetanus testimony.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I had somebody do a fake pregnancy with me once.</v>

168
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Remember that shit stupid.</v>

169
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Just so I would give her money.</v>

170
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

171
00:05:13.061 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of these positive pregnancy tests,</v>

172
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 1>things where they're advertising these things and whether asking for them to</v>

173
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 1>just kind of weird,</v>

174
00:05:22.841 --> 00:05:23.674
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

175
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.280

<v Speaker 1>How much is that?</v>

177
00:05:30.981 --> 00:05:31.581
<v Speaker 1>Twenty $5.</v>

178
00:05:31.581 --> 00:05:32.414
<v Speaker 1>It's a smell.</v>

179
00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.360
<v Speaker 1>20 five bucks just to smell some random chicks pis.</v>

180
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.620
<v Speaker 1>If you're a real freak,</v>

181
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.730
<v Speaker 1>you might go for it.</v>

182
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.540
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there's a.</v>

183
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.330
<v Speaker 1>You could sell that for 25 bucks here.</v>

184
00:05:44.331 --> 00:05:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Send me a rag and I'll pee on it.</v>

185
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.110
<v Speaker 1>I saw outside the realm of possibility.</v>

186
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.690
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy though.</v>

187
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.070
<v Speaker 1>Manipulation.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Just some like that's their,</v>

189
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 1>their relationship is just a constant battle like that.</v>

190
00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.400
<v Speaker 1>So it's gotta be a weird way to enter into a lifelong commitment for fake</v>

191
00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:10.330
<v Speaker 1>pregnancy test.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

193
00:06:10.901 --> 00:06:11.890
<v Speaker 1>what if it all works out?</v>

194
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Happy you got married and one day you're sitting around.</v>

195
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.851
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

196
00:06:15.851 --> 00:06:16.031
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>

197
00:06:16.031 --> 00:06:17.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say something really funny.</v>

198
00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Remember when I had that,</v>

199
00:06:19.451 --> 00:06:20.284
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

200
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.250
<v Speaker 1>that miscarriage,</v>

201
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:22.840
<v Speaker 1>I was never really pregnant.</v>

202
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I was fake.</v>

203
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I needed,</v>

204
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.350
<v Speaker 1>I knew you'd be happy eventually.</v>

205
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.240
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

206
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.103
<v Speaker 1>I was right.</v>

207
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Here we are 60 years later.</v>

208
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.880
<v Speaker 1>The guys like,</v>

209
00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

210
00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

211
00:06:37.181 --> 00:06:37.421
<v Speaker 1>Honey.</v>

212
00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:38.320
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

213
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.770
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be the responsibility of being the one who could possibly get</v>

214
00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:42.251
<v Speaker 1>pregnant.</v>

215
00:06:42.251 --> 00:06:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Boy does that fucking changed the game.</v>

216
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.010
<v Speaker 1>That's why they say that one of the biggest changes in behavior for human beings</v>

217
00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:52.180
<v Speaker 1>was when birth control was invented because then for the first time women had</v>

218
00:06:52.181 --> 00:06:57.181
<v Speaker 1>some sort of control over their own ability to get pregnant or get pregnant,</v>

219
00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.320
<v Speaker 1>their own contraception.</v>

220
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.690
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have to count on,</v>

221
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I got to wear a rubber.</v>

222
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.070
<v Speaker 1>That guy doesn't want to wear a rubber.</v>

223
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise I got to get like an Iud or diaphragm.</v>

224
00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Those things fucking slip out.</v>

225
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you have a funder is tremendous.</v>

226
00:07:10.211 --> 00:07:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Waterfall of loads slamming into that thing.</v>

227
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.460
<v Speaker 1>They can't take a good shot.</v>

228
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:16.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

229
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:17.043
<v Speaker 1>they're good,</v>

230
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.730
<v Speaker 1>they're good for like the average load,</v>

231
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.150
<v Speaker 1>but you get like a wilt chamberlain load and they're just fine.</v>

232
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.993
<v Speaker 1>Swear around.</v>

233
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Flows that sucker sideways like one of those big revolving doors and Indiana</v>

234
00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Jones,</v>

235
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:29.673
<v Speaker 1>that's what it does.</v>

236
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.530
<v Speaker 1>The load headset and opens it up.</v>

237
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.860
<v Speaker 1>That was a big change apparently for women.</v>

238
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 1>So I'm asking,</v>

239
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.521
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

240
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:08.030
<v Speaker 1>itunes or recording to server the fuck outta here.</v>

241
00:08:08.031 --> 00:08:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Server.</v>
