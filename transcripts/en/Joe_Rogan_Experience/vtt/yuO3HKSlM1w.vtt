1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.560
Don't talk shit now.
Oh,
perfect.

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.873
No,

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.090
even bring fucking wine we brought back.

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.310
We have two bottles already,
but you'll probably tell me they suck,

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.250
which you brought us.
Have a sit down and people can hear you.
Well,

6
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.430
that's devious podcast where Steve,

7
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.720
Steve,
there's no nothing.

8
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:27.570
You could really shake it in there like it's less strong than sugar.

9
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:30.910
I think they watered it down or something.
Damn it.
This down.

10
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.770
Lock this bitch Michael Johnson versus [inaudible] data you show.

11
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.590
I think that's a good fight.

12
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.480
Johnson lenses really is a fucking monster.

13
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.550
He is.
He's an end on the ground.
But you know what?

14
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:48.270
So as Johnson not on the ground,
he's not,
but he good luck getting them there.

15
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.310
Why?
Look at watch son calling the underdog.
[inaudible].
What's his name?

16
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.520
Does he work?
Guinea wrestle over eight years and nobody's really good.

17
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.800
These world class on the ground,
it's pronounced that.
Yes.
Dot.
Who was,

18
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.160
how's he going to get them there?
Michael.
John [inaudible] hard to take down.
Oh,

19
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:09.750
and his standup spelling and Johnson's wait.
Oh wait,
what are you saying bro?

20
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:13.170
It happened.
Neil was really good.
But you're underestimating Johnson stand.

21
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.033
So Johnson,
Stan,

22
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.800
I don't think you could say one guy's better than in that situation.
If any way.

23
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.790
I kind of leaned towards Johnson in the stand up a little bit.

24
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.470
Should we do a taste?
Not me,
but didn't,
didn't he get stopped by um,
Dela Rouge?

25
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.700
No.
By Neil Darr.
You wish,
didn't he get stopped by uh,
Ramsey?
Najam?

26
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.750
No,
no,
no.
He knocked him out cold.
He knocked ranzie engine.
Mount Hood.

27
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.330
Ramsey Nugen beat.
That's really good.

28
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.380
Ramsey beat somebody that was really grandpa.
He's off and on.
Great Guy.
Oh,

29
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:44.730
he's a great guy.
He got her Ramsey got Rah Rah.
Fuck.
Holy Fuck.

30
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.960
I cannot put enough Steve in this goddamn coffee.

31
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.780
I call it Steve Callan.
Hey Bud.
Hey Steve.
What's up brother?
No,

32
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.120
he beat Benito dairy.
It too.
I'm right.
He knocked him out.
Ramsey did.
Yes.
Yes.

33
00:01:57.121 --> 00:02:01.380
Ramsey Nid gym in a UFC fight night.
No.

34
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.670
Versus Nelson.
It took place in,
uh,
in Abu Dhabi.
That's the one I'll be dominant.

35
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:09.720
Yeah,
dude,
I'm telling you.
Ramsey,
look Ramsey.
He's had some tough losses,

36
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:13.710
but he's a bad motherfucker.
He's a tough dude.
Tough dude.
And he works hard.

37
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:17.400
She'll relax too on that guy was a piece that he was wrestling with.
I mean,

38
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.040
you're saying his last fight
and your Holbrook,

39
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.520
he got robbed.
I got robbed.
It's just bad fucking judging dude.

40
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:30.360
Really bad judging.
There's so much bad judging.

41
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.460
But you know that Holbrook Kid's tough kid too.
That was a lot of fun.

42
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.450
But Ramsey tagged him.
Ramsey did way more work.
I thought I just,

43
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.620
I just didn't think it was a really big frame for 55 like you look at them up

44
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:48.090
close,
tall,
long Ramsay.
Yes.
Yeah.
He's a really young guy.

45
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.670
He's just a tough dude and a smart dude.

46
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.210
I just really liked them and I really liked that Holbrook kit to,
no disrespect.

47
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:57.480
I thought that Holbrook is a bad motherfucker.
Good wrestler.
Real tough kid.

48
00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:00.420
And he took,
he took some good shots to Eddie.

49
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.630
Are we going to bet on any of the fights tonight?
My mom get,

50
00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.950
you want to bet the sheriff?

51
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.060
Oh,
I need this tank top.
Let's not talk over people.
I'm sorry.
I got excited.

52
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.660
Shit in the middle of negotiating some Dolla dolla bills here was that they were

53
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:18.250
negotiating it.
Sorry Buddy.
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:20.920
I got excited about in the show who's never heard one of these podcasts before.

55
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:24.070
You're like,
what the fuck kind of podcast is this?
What's a fight companion?

56
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.640
If you just started downloading podcasts,

57
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.390
what's happening right now is the UFC is on TV,

58
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.610
on Fox sports one we watched the card,
we get fucked up,
we talk over each other.

59
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.050
We talked nonsense.

60
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.470
We make a lot of ludicrous statements that get blown up in the MMA media.

61
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.520
We write three or four articles for them,

62
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.270
three or four articles for these journalists,
and we have a good time.

63
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.910
They're just all in state and I like this and go,
go.

64
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.500
And so we'll let you know if there's,
um,
w when the fight starts,

65
00:03:56.501 --> 00:04:00.130
we'll let you know at the moment it starts because if you're trying to watch it

66
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:04.930
live,
we're like five or maybe more seconds behind you.
How many seconds,

67
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:06.220
Jamie?
Like 10 maybe.

68
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.130
We got to watch it when they do this because of the Internet.

69
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.920
There's a really quick call.
Joey's colon.
We're on,

70
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.150
we're on air right now in the flight campaign.
What's up?

71
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.063
Yo,
Joe,

72
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.060
what's up brother?
How you doing?
Hey,
we're doing a podcast.

73
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.000
Let's just do this podcast and Jesus Christ.
Listen to it.
So nothing

74
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.300
red wine.
All right.
Um,
so when the fight starts,

75
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:46.300
we'll let you guys know at the moment it starts,
we'll say ready now,

76
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.710
and if you can like just pause your DVR and sync it up with that.
There's no,

77
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.300
there's no good way to do this.

78
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.840
The only way to do this really as if like you watch it afterwards and you're

79
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:59.050
watching it on the Dvr and you've got the laptop there and you sync it up.

80
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.190
Otherwise just be sipping on a 2010 Ganti sound level.

81
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.810
We're not ahead of you,
so we're not going to notice some shit and go,
oh shit.

82
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.690
And then you go,
when's it coming?
When's it coming?
That would suck.

83
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.110
That would suck.
But it's all good.
These,

84
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:16.900
I discovered these never going eat regular pistachios again.

85
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.620
They're already shelled.
Ooh,
it makes pistachio seemed like nonsense.

86
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.521
That's a brilliant,

87
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:24.790
it seems to me the fad these days because I found Starbucks the same ways.

88
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.170
Unwrapped starburst on route on rap guys.
Huh?

89
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.360
How do they keep them from Stillman to each other?
Candy boy over there.

90
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.830
What'd you say?
How do we keep them from sticking to each other?

91
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.590
Put Talcum powder on them.
They kind of stick together.
I'm like an idea.

92
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.950
There's a reason those wrappers around that they're not as tasty.

93
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:45.800
I feel like the rapper kind of seals the for reals.

94
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.060
That's sacred time with this one guys.
Somebody that makes sense.

95
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.350
So what does this wine you?
Um,
you were kind of sewer.
I got ourselves,

96
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:57.950
I got us a beautiful county at 2010 county.
Um,
and a

97
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.330
<v 1>casteller.
The Ama Sanlorenzo don't know what that means,
but it's a,</v>

98
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:06.500
it's an earthy piece of work here.
There you go.
Now,
now the differences,

99
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.810
you're going to get some earth and your wine.
You're going to get some,

100
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.420
some leather and some please don't make me hate you.
I'm sorry.
Don't do

101
00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.690
Ray Borg and a boy.
How do you say this gentleman's name?

102
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.720
G.

103
00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:25.540
A.
N.
G.
Change Gene.
Mr. Herrera.
We'll call Mr. Herrera.
Beautiful Body boards.

104
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.800
A bad mother fucker though,
and really good on the ground.

105
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:31.280
This should be a lot of fun.
That guy's got a great body on him.
Shred it.

106
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:34.610
You have to be there fighting.
One 55 or 45 six 45 smaller.

107
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:39.290
I think that's that 40 fiber.
It's a bad son.
Yeah,
that's not good.

108
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:43.610
That's true.
That's danger.
No one's like,
it's 45 hours out of shape.
It's a job.

109
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.180
Trump triggered the love handles 45 to 55 or so.

110
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.580
It will look a little on the body fat side.

111
00:06:49.581 --> 00:06:52.950
Really thought out the way it's too big for you personally.

112
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.650
I mean my dude,
these guys are one year in my pocket.

113
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.960
You are in my pocket.
What the fuck are you talking to?
Light in the ass.

114
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.470
I'm very happy with Bravo's hair and two man.
Good man.
It's a beautiful,

115
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.300
beautiful man.
He's a beautiful young man.
Thank you.
Rob Was a bit of 45 song.

116
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.030
That's young.
They don't look at Man,

117
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.050
he doesn't look for great beard dot an hour ago.
So yeah,

118
00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:20.580
he doesn't look 45 at all.
Not at all.
Thank you.

119
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.110
Every bit of 28 really 20 2032 33 dude,

120
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.123
they're trying to fuck you

121
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.750
would come up.
We're going to this party.

122
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:37.220
You should come with us to be just the two of us did think that you can just be

123
00:07:37.221 --> 00:07:38.670
friends with guys.
Have you seen this?

124
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.610
You've seen the moon like 10 and 11 on the beach.

125
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.230
[inaudible] Sushi restaurant at the top of Laci.

126
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.500
Anika Marina.
We'll figure it out,
man.

127
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.110
You're done like one section four 57 on the clock right now.
Yeah.

128
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.800
So uh,
here we go.
First fight of the night,

129
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:04.580
450450450 right there.
Bam.

130
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.460
So sync that bitch up.
Oh,
I mean,

131
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:11.000
I'm just going to start on board with a big takedown.

132
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.860
Terrible Wrestling Borg is strong as fuck man.

133
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.250
Every fight.
I know you guys.
You let me know what you think,

134
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:23.360
but their trunks drive me fucking nuts.
White and black and black and white.
Hey,

135
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:28.070
how about we switch it up?
Why not red and blue?
The corners red.
It's confusing.

136
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.710
They had a whole warehouse of shit.
Daddy get rid of it.

137
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:33.110
And that's the first stuff that we're going to,
cause they have to supply them.

138
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.180
How cool is it for the UFC?

139
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:39.740
Reebok steps in and they give them all this cash and it doesn't cost them

140
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:40.880
anything.
They're like,
they give,

141
00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:45.440
they give them cash and they get to dress their fighters.
Did you see that?

142
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:49.310
The Reebok Guy Interview Joe.
He was,
he,

143
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:51.200
I think he's the president or he has something to do.

144
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.950
He's like the head of some thing with Reebok that deals with the UFC.

145
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.070
He said your ass

146
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.650
<v 2>is next in line.
It'd be wearing Reebok.
What does that mean?</v>

147
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.610
It means that he basically said they rushed to get things done cause they,

148
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.640
they said,
you know,
how come some fighters names are misspelled?
You know,
there's,

149
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.340
and he goes,
listen,
there's over 500 guys.
What do you expect?

150
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.950
Will for sure spell people's names right and have everyone on there.

151
00:09:10.951 --> 00:09:14.370
That's what I expect.
And then he goes,
you know,
we didn't think far enough ahead.

152
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:18.540
We just want to get this out so we didn't think about the ring card girls or Joe

153
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.840
Rogan.
That doesn't matter.
I don't have a contract with them.
Well,

154
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:24.680
you'd be wearing pumps.
My man.
It's just the way it is.
Welcome.

155
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.020
I'm going to wear what I feel like wearing.
We better like pumps.

156
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:29.010
Then they give you money.

157
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.660
You don't have to do some sort of a deal with Reebok.

158
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.360
I'm not going to wear their stuff for free.
I'm just not.

159
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.030
It just doesn't make any sense to me and I'm not a fighter.

160
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:41.610
I'm not in the same situation where you get paid for it and I would have to

161
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:44.460
decide whether or not I would want to do that.
I just,

162
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:48.150
that's the problematic aspect of this meant there's many,

163
00:09:48.151 --> 00:09:51.210
but that's one of the big ones.
But if they offer you a contract and are like,

164
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:54.660
hey,
we need you to wear these UFC Reebok pumps for every show.

165
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.690
You know what I like doing?
I like Chuck's me too,
but where am all the time?

166
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.910
Fuck yes.
If con Congress wants to come with some cash comments,
you,
you know why?

167
00:10:02.911 --> 00:10:05.900
Because these are what I like.
I wear these all the time.
It's is all are aware.

168
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.920
There's been amazing Jujitsu going on man.

169
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.370
And we're talking about rema occasionally I'll wear Nike.
Yeah.

170
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.940
And I would wear Reebok it for their cool sneakers.

171
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.560
I don't have like a brand that I love him.
Oh ooh.

172
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:23.550
Both of these guys are really good on the ground.
Both are really good man.

173
00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:27.300
We're seeing a high level Jujitsu match right here.
Seriously.
These guys are off.

174
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.460
Yeah.
Yeah.

175
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:33.090
A lot of Jujitsu and thrown in with punches and shit too.
And I don't know any,

176
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.300
I don't know either of these guys Jake shields here at speaking in which,

177
00:10:36.301 --> 00:10:39.560
cause he's going for this Kimora did you see the Jake shields per Horace fun?

178
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.910
How fuck was at is IAA times and stuff like that as Paul Harvey's the most

179
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:46.660
dangerous guy in the world,
I think.
Sorry,

180
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.280
he's scared he's going to poke in the eye and rip your fucking arm off.

181
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:53.850
But he's also taken stuff to some crazy different primal level,
you know,

182
00:10:53.851 --> 00:10:57.210
like the eye poking and the then the holding the submission.

183
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.530
Even after all he's been through,

184
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.030
he's been kicked out of the UFC for it and he's still holds submission.
No,

185
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:05.400
they warned them in the back.
That's why he got banned.

186
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:10.060
Because in the back they go,
listen,
if you get a submission,
do not hang onto it.

187
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.320
We're not giving you another warning.
This is it.
What's this motherfucker do?

188
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:16.080
Yeah,
hang onto it.
Jake shells was just owning.

189
00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:18.780
I'm just controlling them on the ground.
And he started poking him in the eye,

190
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:22.830
you know,
it was just really fun and really messed his eyes out.
And by the way,

191
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.970
his eyes,
his eyes look really bad.
He's just a scary dude,
man.

192
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:31.140
But he did catch that submission.
He legitimately thought Jay Clean,

193
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.810
legitimately products.
So the end of the fight is not in dispute.

194
00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:38.130
But how did he get,
couldn't see,
couldn't see in round three he could not see.

195
00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:40.520
He was like,
I can't see in the corner.
They asked the Torque,

196
00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:43.440
wanted to call the fight and he goes,
don't call it.
He couldn't see.

197
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:45.850
He was right there.
They was fighting.
It blurs.
Yep.

198
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.890
Jake shields is one of the best passers and carry it.

199
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.980
He's one of the best pastors in the

200
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.430
<v 0>whole game,
if not the best,
if not the best.</v>

201
00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:01.810
He's awesome at passing any pass who's a Marpol haulers.
His guard a few times.

202
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:07.110
And that itself was impressive because Pars is Jujitsu all the way around is top

203
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:09.880
notch.
She's not just good at leg locks.
He's good.
He's got,

204
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.770
he doesn't have any holes in his head.
He's world class.

205
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:12.790
He's world class everywhere.

206
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.580
And the one thing that I was really impressed with his,
his,
his side control,

207
00:12:16.581 --> 00:12:21.340
the escapes,
his guard recovery,
if you watched that,
it was beautiful,

208
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.100
the way he dismounted and the way he,
uh,
cause uh,

209
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.730
Jake shields was passing his shit.
It wasn't easy,
but he ruins all that.

210
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:33.730
He ruins all that being a fucking moron.
This what I'm saying.

211
00:12:33.731 --> 00:12:35.970
Look at this triangle temps.
Yeah,
that's what I'm saying is like,

212
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.730
it's very primal.
When he's fighting.
It's like it's animal Shim.

213
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:44.760
Did shoulder did it get tore off?
Rotate a simple image.

214
00:12:44.761 --> 00:12:49.100
Yeah,
there's damage in his shoulder and his eyes were all jack.

215
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:54.040
What about mark is guy,
he's just not good.

216
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.630
Oh God.
It just looked in,
has been saying it for years.

217
00:12:56.631 --> 00:12:59.500
So he's the worst referee in the business.
I don't know if he's the worst,

218
00:12:59.501 --> 00:13:03.370
but he's made some fucking chambers.
He made a big air and a Frank Mir,

219
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.700
Brock Lesnar fight this one of the big ones because Brock Lesnar was completely

220
00:13:06.701 --> 00:13:11.530
locked up in a submission and he took too fucking long.
There was tap,
tap,

221
00:13:11.531 --> 00:13:15.160
tap and then he's moving in.
He doesn't train and if he doesn't train,

222
00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:18.160
he's never been tapped.
It doesn't tap especially to a legacy.
No idea man.

223
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.810
He doesn't know how close you are to give your shit to destroy.

224
00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.550
That's what big John McCarthy was saying.
He trains every day too and he goes,

225
00:13:24.551 --> 00:13:26.250
I train and keep her the kids.
Yeah,

226
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.090
cause I was trying to keep up so I know what's going on.

227
00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:31.420
A lot of these guys don't train until it got to be in the wrong place too.

228
00:13:31.421 --> 00:13:33.790
You don't tap the guys back.
Hey guys,

229
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:36.130
get it fully lock Kimora you get in between them.

230
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.940
You let him know without any question.
Don touching his back is not the,

231
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.460
it's not the fight happening on his band.
No.

232
00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.770
Paul Horez is a fucking gorilla,
right?
He's,
he's destroying.

233
00:13:47.771 --> 00:13:49.030
He's in the middle of ganking.

234
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:52.360
He's in the middle of winning and he feels stumping,
touching his back.

235
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:55.840
He doesn't know what the fuck it is.
Right.
I mean it's almost not his fault.

236
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.210
He knew that Jake shields was tapping for sure,

237
00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:03.370
but Marilla Bustamante who was his coach lost almost lost a Matt Lindland tapped

238
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:04.860
him and then had a tap and get the,

239
00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:06.580
I shouldn't say almost walk cause he dominated the fight,

240
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:10.600
but he got fucked because he tapped Matt Lindland caught Linden in an arm bar.

241
00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.190
Lindland Seti Tabs,

242
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:17.260
but then let go and then he caught him in a guillotine and a tall,
you know what?

243
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:22.180
You can't blame that on Mazda Gotti,
man.
That was who?
Some Marple horses craze.

244
00:14:22.181 --> 00:14:24.550
It's both.
It's a combination of,
it's crazy.
It's both.

245
00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.520
I can guarantee you if John McCarthy was referee in that match would have been

246
00:14:27.521 --> 00:14:28.354
different hunting.

247
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:33.280
He was bold and he got somebody else probably would have taken a point away from

248
00:14:33.281 --> 00:14:37.290
that.
That blade.
Nice century.
As what herb dean.
Yes.
We were shouted her dean,

249
00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.780
and he's gouging his eyes and she shields kept going and his eyes were

250
00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:44.500
[inaudible].
He said,
he said,
I'll take care of it.
And Jack said,
no,
you won't.
No,

251
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:47.500
you,
you're not doing anything.
Do you not say no,
I'll take care of it.

252
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.910
What does that mean?
You're gonna talk to him?

253
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.130
He's going to smile at you and Pokemon the eyes.
That was one thing.

254
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.490
That was one thing for sure.
Maybe Masa Gotti fucked up really bad there,

255
00:14:55.491 --> 00:15:00.030
but if you watched that Kamora that was in transition.
It's so nasty.

256
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.590
So it was a huge transition from the bottom to the top.

257
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.500
And then he switches and uh,

258
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.620
there's just no way he could have got there in time.

259
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.860
I think the pat on the back was like,
this is the quickest I can get here.
Not,

260
00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:15.620
I'm going to bypass trying to stop him and go around and try it.

261
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:20.330
He was just not in position to get teen rate board.

262
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.260
That's nasty to his,
his legs locked up.
It looks like it's overkill.

263
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.220
It's an amazing the legs you have to do.

264
00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:34.220
All you have to do is get out of that fucking mount,
get those legs separated.

265
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:35.570
That mounted one too.

266
00:15:35.571 --> 00:15:38.660
When they're doing like a guard from the top when they crossed her legs like

267
00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:41.620
that.
God Damn,
that's Nas Joey Benevidez style,

268
00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:46.370
which was no one Benevidez like right there with a mounted guillotine.

269
00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:50.110
When Benevidez tap Tim,
who was it?
Who the fuck was it?
10 means,
yeah,
no,
no,
no.

270
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.740
Not saying names.
Him to tap with his feet.
His,

271
00:15:54.741 --> 00:15:57.350
both his arms were trapped and getting guillotine bolt.

272
00:15:57.351 --> 00:16:00.960
Design to trap and he's slapping with his feet.
Feet.

273
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.780
Benevidez got a nasty one.
These guys have very good shit.

274
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.870
So let me tell you about being in Brazil,

275
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.050
watching Ronda Rousey walk out into the arena.

276
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.590
We've got 16,000 people.
Originally they were trying to,
like,

277
00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:17.570
there were chanting over her fucking song,

278
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:21.490
like she's going out there with their song and they're going,
Ooh,
Ooh,

279
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.490
well then you're gonna die.

280
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:25.000
You're gonna die song that they always saying been there.

281
00:16:25.001 --> 00:16:29.710
Then people are like touching her as she's walking in one slash [inaudible] and

282
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.800
stuff like slapping at their truck.
They have to reach really far,

283
00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:35.180
so they're trying to touch her,

284
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.710
you know that she's not close enough with them to just,
you know,

285
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:39.800
know exactly how to reach her.

286
00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:42.380
So they're trying to reach like a white guy jumping up,

287
00:16:42.381 --> 00:16:45.410
trying to touch a basketball rim.
Like you can't really do it delicately.

288
00:16:45.411 --> 00:16:49.580
You've got to know passive way to do it.
Best to try to touch it.
But dude,

289
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.210
she walks forward with his fucking stare of death.

290
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:57.620
Like she didn't give a fuck about anybody else.
All that stuff was just nonsense.

291
00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.620
Total tunnel vision and why it was happening.
I was like,
what?

292
00:17:00.621 --> 00:17:03.560
We're seeing some crazy history shit here.

293
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:07.530
Like there's something about her right now where she's kind of transcended the

294
00:17:07.531 --> 00:17:12.380
sport in some crazy way.
You're emotional,
dude.
I almost cried,
cried,

295
00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.320
cried when I was interviewing her because I felt like,
I felt like,
you know,

296
00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:17.540
when you,
I would say that if you could tell your kids,

297
00:17:17.541 --> 00:17:22.380
like I was there when Muhammad Ali beat Sonny Liston.
Did you say though,

298
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.740
I was there when Mike Tyson,

299
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:26.960
when Mike Tyson beat Trevor Berbick and won the title,

300
00:17:26.961 --> 00:17:29.120
the youngest heavy weight ever.
I was there.
You know,
if you could say that like,

301
00:17:29.121 --> 00:17:31.340
wow,
like don,
my rare always talks about Michael Spinks.

302
00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:34.400
He was there from Mike Tyson,
Michael Spanx.
He goes,
John,
I was in the audience.

303
00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:37.480
I saw him in the eyes.
This is like,
it was a historic event.
You know,

304
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.550
the only differences is when you say those names,
and I'm not hating on Rhonda,

305
00:17:40.551 --> 00:17:42.890
but when you know,
when you say like Evander Holyfield Tyson,

306
00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:45.320
I was there from [inaudible] son.
He listened.
I was there for that.

307
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.730
I was there for Rhonda Verse Pitch Kaleah no Sir.

308
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.810
It was the best chick in Brazil at one 35 they come.
No,
she's not.
Well,
why?

309
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.940
There's PR.
There's Brazilians and rank higher than her.
No,
no,
no.

310
00:17:59.941 --> 00:18:04.400
She's ranked number eight.
No,
but Eddie said the best.
Listen,
listen,

311
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.930
she can't make the weight yet,
but that's a different story.

312
00:18:06.931 --> 00:18:09.030
And she just recently got signed with the UFC.

313
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:12.420
This is Rhonda is first time in Brazil.
You know it's a first time in Brazil.

314
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.420
It's that when Rhonda came to Brazil,
that's what he's talking about.

315
00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:20.550
And it could have been fucking,
you know what's different?
I think it's different.

316
00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:24.240
Listen,
it doesn't have to be equal.
I'm not saying that.
What I'm saying is it is,

317
00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:27.640
it is without a doubt and historic event.
Fortunately she fights for sure.

318
00:18:27.641 --> 00:18:32.310
5 million Instagram followers in a fucking day.
How many?
1.5 million.

319
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:36.360
That's this paper view is going to be bigger than UFC one 89 it's gonna be

320
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.660
Connor Mcgregor floods.
She's by far the biggest star.
There's all,

321
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:44.070
and he's means all over the internet saying don't be a do nothing bitch.

322
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.280
Cause that's what she said.
She said,
I'm not doing nothing.

323
00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.540
Bitch sits around waiting for some millionaire to fucker.

324
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:53.510
And like everybody was like,
Holy Shit.
She's just gang.
She,
she,
she,
she's not,

325
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.350
she's,
she's like a walking example of feminism.
Like meritocracy.
Like she's,

326
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.740
she does it.
She doesn't talk.
He's cheating.

327
00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:06.240
Does judged on a curve now.
She walked out when she knocked her out,

328
00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:11.430
she kaos her and then she goes,
don't cry and then walks away from her.

329
00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.170
And social shifts struts around the rest.

330
00:19:15.171 --> 00:19:18.850
She's a different demeanor on a pen.
Dot.
No,
no,
no.

331
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:24.210
She's strutting around the octagon and the audience has to give it up.

332
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.930
They have to cheer for her district and now,

333
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.200
and now you didn't give us Misha take three.
But in Brazil,

334
00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:34.860
captain negative here in Brazil,
even in Brazil,

335
00:19:34.861 --> 00:19:37.760
they're cheering for her at the wins.
They were booing.
Batchko hey,

336
00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:40.560
in Brazil and the way she is by far the biggest store,

337
00:19:40.561 --> 00:19:44.610
it's not like she's transcended Sally like Conor Mcgregor Flying Irish people

338
00:19:44.611 --> 00:19:46.650
over.
This is actual Brazilians.

339
00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:50.290
This is actual Brazilians booing one of their own country when,

340
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.420
which is unheard of until it,
she's loud and nationalistic country.
I think she's,

341
00:19:54.421 --> 00:19:55.670
she's undeniable and she's,

342
00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.390
there's a human example here of triumph over all odds in a way.
Like,
you know,

343
00:20:00.391 --> 00:20:04.530
just to be a woman and in such a short period of time to be the biggest draw

344
00:20:04.531 --> 00:20:08.580
where I was in,
uh,
I was in a with,
how was I?
Um,
I was in,

345
00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.070
I was doing stand up in Dallas and I was in this bar.

346
00:20:11.071 --> 00:20:13.800
It was just packed and the minute she walked out and he starts beating,

347
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.180
everybody went crazy.

348
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.480
If you told me that a woman could garner that kind of a attention as a fighter,

349
00:20:18.481 --> 00:20:20.450
I would have been,
I would have told you two years,
three years old.

350
00:20:20.451 --> 00:20:23.520
She's just not like anybody we've ever seen before.
When you say a woman fighter,

351
00:20:23.521 --> 00:20:27.690
you're judging on the women fight or that you've seen the girls that were really

352
00:20:27.691 --> 00:20:29.760
good as like boxers,
like you know,

353
00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:33.860
Christy Martin was kind of fun to watch and Laila Ali was fun to watch to see a

354
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:37.770
Riker and Gina Carano.
It's fun to watch.
This is another level.

355
00:20:37.771 --> 00:20:41.600
This is some Nice Tyson shit.
She's the female version of Mike Tyson juice.

356
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.490
Pickles are fucking terrifies you to get in there with her.
Did you think?

357
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.100
Did you think that she would dispatch Correia that that easily?
I mean,

358
00:20:48.101 --> 00:20:51.410
I thought she would submit her right before she would rag doll or and maybe beat

359
00:20:51.411 --> 00:20:53.250
are facing with elbows.
That's what I was thinking.

360
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.470
I think if they find a hundred times that fight goes like that 100 times.

361
00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.890
It's no competition.
Here's where the fuck she wants to.
That girl.

362
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.980
She does whatever she wants standing.
She does whatever she wants on the ground.

363
00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:06.010
You'll see one,
one lot of honey.
Look at that.
Oh my God.
Look,

364
00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:10.270
a raid board's head is squealing blood.
Look at that.
It's flying out of them.

365
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:14.380
That is crazy dude.
That is like a broken faucet there.

366
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:18.970
Stopping it because of the blood gets on his eye.
What is,
yeah,
it's on his cheek,

367
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:21.700
but he's thinking it's above the eyebrow.
Blood is pumping.

368
00:21:21.701 --> 00:21:24.790
It looks like this is done on his cheek.
It's hard to tell.
It's hard to tell.

369
00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:28.210
Can you tell?
It's like the slitter that I,
Huh?
Yeah.
Oh,
it is on the island.
Oh,

370
00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:32.010
it looks like more.
Yeah,
it's the eye.
It's like at the slit.
Anyway.

371
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.120
They shouldn't have stopped that.
He's in a really good bullshit,

372
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.760
but they better put them back in that position.
That's where it does.
Oh yeah.

373
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:40.990
Okay.
That's good.
Think about it.

374
00:21:40.991 --> 00:21:44.290
Think about what you're saying about Rhonda right now and how this is such a

375
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:49.410
like a historical time and what Callan sand and then even the fact that uh,

376
00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:55.060
uh,
Brendan is like saying like,
well she's not really getting any competition.

377
00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.040
Put all that together and then you look at Cyborg,
you know what I mean?

378
00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:04.510
For the level sideboards,
nowhere near Rhonda is level.
Yeah.
It's in the CFL.

379
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:09.730
Cyborg Cyborg is known as a fighter.

380
00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:15.100
Yes.
Cause if Ron does not face it,
if we're,

381
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:18.040
if we're going to see if we're going to make fun of Rhonda is competition.

382
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.730
I'm not making fun of for Rhonda Competition.
You are.
Yeah.

383
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.720
And I'm saying Ron's competitions,
nothing.
She's,

384
00:22:22.721 --> 00:22:25.180
that's how much better she is then those girls,
and it's not Ron,
it's faults.

385
00:22:25.181 --> 00:22:28.720
Not the UFC.
His fault.
It's the state of the female fights right now.
It's just,

386
00:22:28.721 --> 00:22:31.690
that's what it is,
is so new and Ron side fucking bad ass.

387
00:22:31.691 --> 00:22:34.810
Did you know what I mean?
Is the best we have ever done?
We won't see another,

388
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.130
but Syep sideboards,
she's just not in the same realm as Rhonda.
Well,

389
00:22:39.131 --> 00:22:41.860
this is because she doesn't get any fights.
I mean,

390
00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:44.590
she's fighting these girls popularity wise,

391
00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:48.630
everything across the board to,
do you know,
if she had a it,

392
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.540
she should have kickboxing bout with this chick Joe.

393
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.050
Her name was Jay Jay.
Oh,
I know how you say it.
Yeah,
she's

394
00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.080
the one she lost.
She lost.

395
00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:02.710
She fought like one of the best female kickboxers on the fucking planet.

396
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:05.800
A chick that can't get a fight.
Nobody wants a fighter in bars is back.

397
00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:07.750
She fought us here.
The distance she went,

398
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:09.360
she went the distance with her and this was,

399
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.760
which is not our sport because she's an MMA fighter is a big difference.

400
00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:15.670
Especially with the big gloves on the fight.
You know,
it's just not the same.

401
00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:17.530
She can't take people down.
She can't,
you know,

402
00:23:17.531 --> 00:23:20.440
there's a lot of things you can't do,
but that chick,
she,

403
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.900
she got in there with one of the best in the fucking world.

404
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:27.490
She's trying to fight people,
but there's all the allegations of steroids.

405
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.750
She's failed fast.
Yeah.
If there's no allegation test one test.
Yeah.

406
00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:37.090
Physically.
No,
you're right.
Absolutely.
Look,
I'm not,
I'm a Chris Cyborg Fan.

407
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.470
Let me just say that right now.
As a a fight analyst or a fight fan,

408
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.950
she's fun to watch,
man.
I mean,
I don't know if it's fan.
I mean I,

409
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.050
it's striking and it,
her Jujitsu.
Oh,
she's taught class.

410
00:23:48.051 --> 00:23:51.740
I mean as far as she's a brown belt level on the pill and she's really good.

411
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.090
She's not as good as Rhonda on the ground.
No,
no.
Just close fucking way bigger.

412
00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.150
She hits wait,
looks like she hits like a Mack truck.
Any woman like,

413
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:04.480
and that's unforgiving.
Right.
So if she,
I'll get her to one 35 gallon.

414
00:24:04.481 --> 00:24:05.330
The sear here like that.

415
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:07.850
Well that's the thing that Robin black had a really good point.

416
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.240
Robin black was one of the best fight analysts out there and good dude.

417
00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:14.360
I had him on the podcast.
Very,
very knowledgeable and a huge fan of the sport.

418
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:18.920
He's like,
it's bullshit.
All she has to do is eat less and run.
Everybody does it.

419
00:24:18.921 --> 00:24:22.040
You want to lose weight?
You can lose weight.
Fucking 50 cent did it for a movie.

420
00:24:22.041 --> 00:24:25.640
He lost like a hundred pounds.
Look at fucking Matthew mcconaughey.
Exactly.

421
00:24:25.641 --> 00:24:28.850
Matching mechanic.
He could get eight people can do it.
You get it.
You can do it.

422
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:32.290
People.
What about a homeboy with fucking Batman?
What's his name?

423
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.200
Chris and Christian Bale.
Christian Bale you,

424
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:39.850
but can you fight it that way anyway to fight even better if you don't ever cut,

425
00:24:40.251 --> 00:24:41.084
wait,
how about that?

426
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.780
How about you let her fight at one 70 that's what she walks around that,
right?

427
00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.550
No,
it's bullshit.
There's a reason why you have to cut weight.

428
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.430
You have to cut weight because they're trying to figure out some way we can both

429
00:24:49.431 --> 00:24:53.940
agree on even terms.
I don't think she has any heavier than one 35 pound,

430
00:24:53.941 --> 00:24:57.740
24 or five pounds.
Any athlete.
If,
if,
if Dana called me up right now,
it was like,

431
00:24:57.741 --> 00:24:58.580
hey Brandon,
listen,

432
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.030
we need you to get 20 to five and you can fight the champ at one 85.

433
00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.440
I'm going to try my fucking best to make that fight.
I'm sure it's fucking,

434
00:25:05.441 --> 00:25:08.810
I'm like,
no,
no,
no.
We got to do at one 90 note,
whatever they want,

435
00:25:08.811 --> 00:25:12.350
I'm going to do,
especially when I'm Cyborg,
I want to become relevant.

436
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:16.700
I have to make,
talking about Blues Cyborg,
that's common.

437
00:25:16.701 --> 00:25:20.430
She was walking around.
She goes about one 75 she did.
Well,
here's the thing.

438
00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.780
A lot of that is a lot of weight and it's very unusual.
Lot of weight.
But here's,

439
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:26.810
here's the other thing,
not the norm.
One of the things about,
about steroids,

440
00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.180
and this is not saying that she's on it,
I'm not making any allegations,

441
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:34.330
but one of the things about the people that compete on them is that they find it

442
00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:38.840
very addictive and it's not just a matter of the fact that it allows you to
heal.

443
00:25:38.841 --> 00:25:41.560
It's not just a matter of fact that it gives you,
you know,
this,
uh,

444
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:44.120
this ability to train harder.
But it also,

445
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:47.910
there's a confidence thing where you know,
you're on this shit,
you know,

446
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.760
and they all talk about it.
They all talk about it.

447
00:25:49.761 --> 00:25:52.610
Like when I was on it and I was fighting,
I felt invincible,

448
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.550
especially in the female stars from a female's body.

449
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.420
It's going to change some things,
bone structure and attitude.
The way she fights.

450
00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:03.890
She fights like an angry dude.
Yes,
she malls.
So you take that away.
And again,

451
00:26:03.891 --> 00:26:05.690
I'm not saying she's on testosterone,
she's,

452
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:09.110
she's failed a testosterone test before.
If you look at the two factors,

453
00:26:09.111 --> 00:26:13.540
the fact that she's failed a test before and the way that she looks her flesh,

454
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.660
the way you still look when she was in Strikeforce and she fought Gina.
Okay.

455
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:22.160
All that nonsense aside.
I think it's worth when we know we know about the sport,

456
00:26:22.161 --> 00:26:25.460
it's worth considering the possible.
I agree.
Right.
That's fair.
That's fair.

457
00:26:25.461 --> 00:26:29.420
As far as you can guess,
that said,
she's just bigger,
she's way bigger.

458
00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:32.930
And this idea that Rhonda has to move up.
Like she actually she doesn't.

459
00:26:32.931 --> 00:26:34.880
Why would Rhonda move up?
Why does she have to do anything?

460
00:26:34.881 --> 00:26:38.440
She's the champ cause to the common folk to the common fan.
Yeah.

461
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.110
No one knows who this is.
A cyborg is,

462
00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.410
this is not a matter of her not being able to do it.

463
00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.010
It's a matter of her not taking any

464
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.820
<v 2>of the steps to attempt to do it.
Like if you really want to do it,</v>

465
00:26:47.821 --> 00:26:51.090
what you do is you make that weight.
You hire Mike Dolce,

466
00:26:51.091 --> 00:26:54.390
you make that weight and you put up a fucking video of you making that last
hair.

467
00:26:54.391 --> 00:26:58.980
I'm waiting,
making in one 35 see,
I can do it Rhonda.
Let's do this bitch.

468
00:26:58.981 --> 00:27:03.670
I want my title.
Boom.
Biggest fight ever.
Ever,
ever,

469
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:08.280
ever,
ever.
What do you think would happen?
Shit.
Back at jre one,
whatever.

470
00:27:08.281 --> 00:27:12.270
When Rhonda was on Joe Rogan Show I before the UFC even had chicks.

471
00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:13.573
You know what I thought?

472
00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.820
What freaked me out is when Cyborg FOBT,

473
00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:21.660
Gina Carano and strike force.
I worked for the UFC for eight years.

474
00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.820
You're used to the crowd and what it sounds like.

475
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:28.590
I never heard a crowd like that ever in all the hundreds of shows I've been to.

476
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.160
That sounded like a Beatles concert when Gina Carano came out.

477
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:35.880
It sounded like it was a Britney Spears concert cause she's,
and I thought,
wow,

478
00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.770
multiply that times a hundred yes.

479
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:41.810
Rhonda in Brazil screaming like Justin Bieber was on stage.

480
00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:47.430
It was like Elvis was there.
I think Rhonda Beats Cyborg even at one 45 really?

481
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.770
But I don't think Ron has any reason to why I'm the chase,

482
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:57.010
I guess fight of all time.
That's the biggest
danger.

483
00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.120
Upper Rhonda.
It's a dangerous fight,

484
00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:03.540
but that's what the public doesn't know who Cyborg is,
so they don't give a fuck.

485
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:07.080
Listen,
if the blood cyborg fought,
if signed right now in the UFC,

486
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.230
how long would it take for them to blow that the fuck up?

487
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.380
And everybody knows who Cyborg is and they'll take a while.
Oh,

488
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.310
it will take fucking one week.
No better.
Let me ask you the line.

489
00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:18.630
Let's look at this rationally.

490
00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.810
Let's say would say we know for sure because we don't know anything for sure.

491
00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.630
Right.
But let's say we know for sure the Rhonda is not juicing.

492
00:28:24.631 --> 00:28:27.630
She's not doing anything guaranteed.
Okay.
I believe you,

493
00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:29.700
but let's say we know for sure.
Okay.

494
00:28:29.701 --> 00:28:34.650
And let's say we also know for sure that Cyborg might be on something and she

495
00:28:34.651 --> 00:28:37.800
might be on something to make one 45 then are you okay with it?

496
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:38.471
Are you okay with it?

497
00:28:38.471 --> 00:28:41.910
If they both fight at one 45 and one person is naturally bigger and might be on

498
00:28:41.911 --> 00:28:42.744
something

499
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:48.300
where they fight one [inaudible] this is my question.
Do you have any,

500
00:28:48.301 --> 00:28:51.720
do you have a different opinion about this with women than you do with men?

501
00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.590
Not really.
Here's the thing with Chris Weidman.
Here's a perfect example.

502
00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.080
Chris Weidman's dominant champ,
just like Rhonda,

503
00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.690
if he was going to fight Vitara and we knew that [inaudible] tour might be on

504
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:03.770
TRT,
I still wouldn't have a problem with it.
And I don't think why?

505
00:29:03.771 --> 00:29:06.150
Why would we have a problem with it either?
I think Weidman would be like,

506
00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:07.410
I'm going to still three isn't that what,

507
00:29:07.411 --> 00:29:10.660
that's the reason I wouldn't have promise that because someone's already big

508
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:13.740
trouble.
It's already got a bigger frame and I'll test the point.

509
00:29:13.741 --> 00:29:16.850
It's a different,
it's a different,
it's a completely different,
that's the car.

510
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:22.440
Just be tourists.
Brisbane's means I end a fucking the next level.

511
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:26.490
You will never be the same.
Rock Anderson one round.
Tko Dan Henderson.

512
00:29:26.491 --> 00:29:27.330
Look at all these dudes.

513
00:29:27.331 --> 00:29:31.110
He was let seven zero six and we're just Keown dude's take them off
testosterone.

514
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.990
What the fuck was that?
His body doesn't look the same.

515
00:29:33.991 --> 00:29:37.670
He doesn't perform the ceremony clothes.
It's like going from a variety of civic.

516
00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:41.680
So that's the question is like if she's capable of doing something,

517
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:46.090
she's capable of doing something that's not natural to stay at one 45 or to get

518
00:29:46.091 --> 00:29:49.750
up higher than one 45 and the one seventies then then what?

519
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.280
How do you feel about the fight then?

520
00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.890
Cause then because we different fight and then what's the UFC do?

521
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:59.280
Let's say the ULC let's say they do do that fine and Cyborg knocks rundown.

522
00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:03.280
Yeah.
Knocks her out.
Dead.
Dead.
Yeah.
And then what?
Then what do we do?

523
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:04.840
It's a beautiful thing.
It makes everything

524
00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.930
better.
No.
Does she lose it?

525
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:13.390
What if she loses then Cyborg test the sport even more interesting.
No,

526
00:30:13.391 --> 00:30:15.730
it doesn't cause then we don't have our star.

527
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:19.530
We don't have anyone crossing over into pop culture.
Ronners a plain sentence,

528
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:22.810
all extra shit.
We
don't need that shit.

529
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.350
You don't mind if someone is on the shit and they knock somebody out like that

530
00:30:26.351 --> 00:30:29.350
and then you find out that the reason why she got knocked out like that is

531
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.620
because the other person was,
I do.
I think it's cheating.
This is the thing.

532
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:35.470
This is what my,
the sexist in me is sexist in me.

533
00:30:35.471 --> 00:30:38.530
I have more of an issue with it for some reason with women.
Well maybe because

534
00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.530
what I'm saying,
I'm not even comfortable with my,
my opinions on it.

535
00:30:44.531 --> 00:30:45.041
Like I'm like,

536
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:49.510
why do I have a different opinion if it's women and the woman was on something.

537
00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:54.730
I agree.
When me and Rhonda w pardon me,
Rhonda,
we're hanging out.

538
00:30:54.731 --> 00:30:58.930
I would tell her in less cyborg agrees grease to the strict testing.

539
00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.880
You are not fighting her.
There's no way.
I haven't talked to him forever,

540
00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:07.450
but um,
you know what I'm saying?
When I was with her and I still care about it.

541
00:31:07.451 --> 00:31:10.450
But the thing is is there's no way you're taking this fighting.

542
00:31:10.451 --> 00:31:13.360
It's fucking the Brazilian Drago with if she's on shit,

543
00:31:13.361 --> 00:31:14.470
unless she's going to come.

544
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:19.420
Especially she's going to enlist Ivana ten five there's no way at one 45 she's

545
00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:21.280
just a way bigger human.
It's dangerous.

546
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:25.900
What would you guys said before it just lose the Goddamn motherfucking away.

547
00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:32.470
It's a fucking journeys yet for her to get what the fuck is going on.

548
00:31:32.471 --> 00:31:35.530
Just lose the Goddamn way of all time.

549
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:40.650
The fuck you doing sideboard in a way of getting down to 35 would cancel out in

550
00:31:40.751 --> 00:31:44.020
some ways.
The Tet,
the idea of testosterone in terms of,

551
00:31:44.021 --> 00:31:47.110
I think it'd be hard to do it.
It'd be hard to do it when you've,

552
00:31:47.111 --> 00:31:49.030
when you've lost literally 45 pounds.

553
00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.910
She would also have to guarantee that she actually made the weight cause another

554
00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.560
sneaky fucked up thing that people do is they just don't make the weight.

555
00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:00.370
Like Julio Cesar Chavez Jr and his last fight they contracted,

556
00:32:00.371 --> 00:32:03.540
the first five were supposed to have one 68 then they moved to one 70 and he

557
00:32:03.541 --> 00:32:08.380
didn't even make one guy drives me fucking it'd be not one 70.8 came in.

558
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.740
He was out of shape,
didn't fight well fought like through you.

559
00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.470
Just a few punches per round but it was way bigger,

560
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:19.220
way bigger and the guy would land 30 shots and he would lay into and wobbled a

561
00:32:19.221 --> 00:32:23.950
guy and you can do that one the round with just a few body shots.
It was,

562
00:32:23.951 --> 00:32:28.180
it was like literally like a disgusting punches getting close and swing with

563
00:32:28.181 --> 00:32:30.610
club and bill look like you and me in the ring.
Swear to God,

564
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.450
Julio shop a junior is was a big dude and it was tiny guy.

565
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:35.830
That's like run and Cyborg.

566
00:32:35.831 --> 00:32:39.010
If they didn't agree to one 35 you'd have some shit on your hands.
Man,

567
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.100
that's not going to be good

568
00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.620
<v 0>at one 35 it's going to happen.</v>

569
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.770
And imagine the fucking audience,

570
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:50.540
every nice grandma and your girlfriends,

571
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.400
everybody's going to watch that shit.

572
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:57.190
He the whole fucking world in Africa and Latin America.
No,

573
00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:02.480
you don't know the regular person has no fucking idea who cyborg is.
No idea.

574
00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:03.453
But here's a map

575
00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.890
move is Misha Tate versus Cyborg is Berlin 40 this is per night fighting

576
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.250
gigantic fight
right now.

577
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:17.330
I'm going to meet you.
You never had to do that.

578
00:33:17.331 --> 00:33:20.260
I'm not a Tucker is going to be the toughest fight that you should take.

579
00:33:20.261 --> 00:33:20.991
It has ever happened.

580
00:33:20.991 --> 00:33:23.900
And cyborg the toughest fight rather the Cyborg has ever had.

581
00:33:23.901 --> 00:33:27.080
Really Kate would be.
Why is that gangster

582
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:29.860
gangster.
It's tough.
It's funny.

583
00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.840
I'll tell you the only girl that's taken Ronda Rousey into the third round,
but,

584
00:33:32.841 --> 00:33:36.860
but,
but,
and she's destroying your Cyborg hits all due respect to each tape.

585
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:40.100
I believe Cyborg hits a whole lot harder than they should.

586
00:33:40.101 --> 00:33:43.460
Tape does at 45 I think you're right.
But I tell you right now,

587
00:33:43.461 --> 00:33:46.100
she's got five girls.
I would feel with all due respect,

588
00:33:46.101 --> 00:33:47.660
I would favor me should take over.

589
00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:51.800
Gina Carano Cyborg and Gina Carano was a very competitive fight.

590
00:33:51.801 --> 00:33:53.180
That's the thing that people don't remember about.

591
00:33:53.181 --> 00:33:56.660
That was forever Corrado mounted her.
You're right.
She's better now,
I'm sure.

592
00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.360
But Gina Carano MMA,
she was still fucking girls up back.

593
00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:02.360
Fucking still fucking girl.
She was Gina Kolata mounted her.

594
00:34:02.361 --> 00:34:07.190
Shelly scrambled on the ground and it was some controls situation at one 40 I

595
00:34:07.191 --> 00:34:11.870
think Mitch states and give Cyborg some Fritz Shit.
Get lit up.
Nope.

596
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:12.410
And that,

597
00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:16.160
and then if they do it at one 35 and she fights where the one 35 it doesn't get

598
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:17.970
past the two minute mark for sure.

599
00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.510
I'm going to be able to pick cyborg down a wrestling wrestling's not that good.

600
00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.400
It's hard to take down.
Cybex hard to take down and she hits hard.
I think me,

601
00:34:24.410 --> 00:34:27.770
she'll get lit up.
I love me shit.
But cyborg would be too much.

602
00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:33.100
One Misha one the scrambles against Sarah McMahon.
Ceric man's an Olympic medal.

603
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:35.900
She's about to fight right now,
but she beat Sarah McMahon now.

604
00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:40.610
You know what's fascinating about this whole class for guys are talking about

605
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.830
passionately about women fighters

606
00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:48.140
because with Rhonda,
Rhonda fight up there,

607
00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.180
Holly,
Holly Holm,
Holly Holly Hall is not ready yet.

608
00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:59.780
That's the fight that I want to see a fight.
That's the next one I'd want to see.

609
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:03.910
And you know who's really tough
man,
she just beat,

610
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:08.300
she was on Invicta.
She's like an old school fight who was really good.

611
00:35:08.301 --> 00:35:12.920
She just beat a new mic.
Irene,
I'll Donna.
Ooh.
She said,
fuck the fuck.

612
00:35:12.921 --> 00:35:14.090
I think if you're Ameesha,

613
00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.570
if you're Misha and you came in a different lifetime and there was no Rhonda,

614
00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:20.150
she's,
she's just killing shit.
You know what I'm saying?
She's the best.

615
00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:24.230
She's as good as she is because Rhonda is so God damn good that the aspiration

616
00:35:24.231 --> 00:35:25.400
like the,
the,
the inspiration,

617
00:35:25.401 --> 00:35:29.810
the top of the mountain is so high that everybody else,
their vibration comes up.

618
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.330
She's like the Michael Jordan.
Everyone's trying to pursue that.
She's,

619
00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.950
there's something about her man.
She's got this crazy aura championship.

620
00:35:37.951 --> 00:35:42.240
Rhonda Dude,
when I,
I really did almost crying when I was interviewing her.

621
00:35:42.241 --> 00:35:46.710
I just,
it was the,
the moment was so powerful and plus no one,
her story,
no one,

622
00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:51.240
her story with her dad and the whole thing about this girl,
she,
I mean,

623
00:35:51.241 --> 00:35:53.640
whether or not that's actually what she was trying to say,
what she's saying,

624
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:57.180
she hopes rotted,
doesn't kill herself.
But Ron,
his dad did kill himself.

625
00:35:57.181 --> 00:35:57.900
So that was like,

626
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:02.850
it's part of her story and she had all this extra motivation seeing her there

627
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.610
and having daughters too.
And just this is all like so much going on and get it

628
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.620
goddamn emotional.
She's so powerful.
I think.

629
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:16.050
I think what's really important too about the steroid debate and just as we're

630
00:36:16.051 --> 00:36:18.570
talking about whether or not,
you know,

631
00:36:18.571 --> 00:36:22.650
w if whenever we get excited about a fight,
we always assume,

632
00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.320
or we'd like to assume that they're in,

633
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.180
in many ways there's an equal playing field.
They're kind of starting,

634
00:36:27.181 --> 00:36:30.330
even though they may be genetically different and stuff,
right.
You want it,

635
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:35.280
you want to believe that nobody's actually doing underhanded things.

636
00:36:35.281 --> 00:36:38.820
That clearly gives you an advantage before you even get into the ring.
Right?
Yes.

637
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.080
And that's,
that's,
I think that's the heart of,
of real competition.

638
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.030
That's what makes it so much fun.
That's,

639
00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.120
that's the sport way too long to think like that.
Brian,

640
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:51.300
you've been around way too.
My professor,
I'm just saying that's what we,

641
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.030
that's what we,
as I say,
like as a culture,

642
00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:58.290
we want a level playing field and still when we think about Chris Weidman and

643
00:36:58.291 --> 00:36:59.340
Luke Rockhold,
we,

644
00:36:59.341 --> 00:37:02.450
all of us are really excited about that fight cause we don't know if I have or

645
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:05.640
we don't know what it'll happen and we wouldn't want to think our Luke was doing

646
00:37:05.641 --> 00:37:05.971
a,
you know,

647
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:10.320
something or that somebody was doing something underhanded to get an advantage

648
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:12.180
before they even stepped in the ring.
That's all.
I guess.

649
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:18.230
Meanwhile Ronda Rousey's and some crazy commercial said that's nuts man.

650
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:21.150
But the thing is this isn't anything manufacturer.

651
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:25.110
That's what's crazy is this is really her.
She really is that bad ass.

652
00:37:25.111 --> 00:37:29.700
Like her technique is spectacular.
This isn't like look,
with all due respect,

653
00:37:29.701 --> 00:37:33.570
like Paige vanzant is tough as fuck and she's really cute and she has good

654
00:37:33.571 --> 00:37:35.280
scrambles.
But when you see her,

655
00:37:35.281 --> 00:37:38.220
you see a young fighter that is learning how to fight.
It has a long ways to go,

656
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:41.940
long ways to go.
When you see Rhonda launching bitches through the air,

657
00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:47.160
when she's dropping down on Misha Tate,
after a highlight,
real fucking hip toss,

658
00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:52.460
boons drop drops and some next level tech.

659
00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:57.660
Have you ever taught well as this aura,
this epic person on a podcast?

660
00:37:57.661 --> 00:38:01.170
Have you ever talked about an MMA fighter longer than we've talked about Ron bed

661
00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.920
a day?
Well,
because there's so much controversy,
man.
I don't know.

662
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.710
Right with guys,
there's not too much controversy.
Right?

663
00:38:07.711 --> 00:38:10.950
It's pretty cut black and white.
With Ron,
it's not black.
And here's the deal man.

664
00:38:10.951 --> 00:38:13.080
I think the UFC should have more women's weight classes.

665
00:38:13.081 --> 00:38:15.550
I think they should have a one 45 and there's not nothing bro.

666
00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:18.690
I think if they did have a one in fort you built build it and they will come and

667
00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.140
build it and they will call it about two 25 he's a heavyweight.
Just don't.

668
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:23.070
That's true that too,

669
00:38:23.071 --> 00:38:26.970
but I don't think you should have like you don't have to have that many fights.

670
00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:29.640
Like if you have a woman like Cyborg and he,

671
00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:33.030
she's at Invicta and she has these fights in there every now and again.

672
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:36.070
They're not that often.
And when she's fighting,
she's fighting girls that are way

673
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.890
<v 1>lower level than her.
Why not have those fights in the UFC?</v>

674
00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.200
Why not have everybody aspired?

675
00:38:40.201 --> 00:38:42.790
Cause that's exactly what you had in the strawweight division until you're on

676
00:38:42.791 --> 00:38:46.990
jet check stepped up and became this monster at one 15 just smashing.

677
00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:50.920
Everybody will do it to do do ultimate 45 for females.

678
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:54.280
I think the answer every female at one 45 fuck exactly it.

679
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:56.840
That's how been and given us the same old dudes and all that.

680
00:38:56.850 --> 00:39:01.300
Do have one 45 just all house 16 one 45 the answer might be that they're just

681
00:39:01.301 --> 00:39:03.690
too many fighters to begin with.
In UFC,
no,
there's,

682
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.680
there's so many cards they should,

683
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:10.150
they should find out what Gabby Garcia can cut down to and then focus.

684
00:39:10.151 --> 00:39:13.360
Hold the vision on her and she's done a bed.
She,
she's fucking,

685
00:39:13.930 --> 00:39:17.830
she's so shredded.
Ready?
She's 200 plus pounds.

686
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:22.450
She over 200 pounds even shut it.
Yup.
She's six years.

687
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:27.380
She's pretty,
she's six.
She's six foot three bosses.

688
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:31.530
Four.
I follow her on Instagram.
She could be I think six,
three Spanish.

689
00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:36.400
I was in the elevator with there in China for Abu Dhabi and I looked up my holy

690
00:39:36.401 --> 00:39:38.260
shit.
I thought I was standing next to Brock Lesnar.

691
00:39:38.261 --> 00:39:43.261
I would ask her to carry me in a photo or ask you to carry me like a baby.

692
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.260
Me Too.
She know what she only opponent.
She's gonna find heroin bar like,

693
00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.470
cause there's,
you know what?
There she is right there.
That's 200 pounds.

694
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.760
She lost a lot of weight.
She has,
but she's,
she lost

695
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:58.720
because you know America got millions and millions and millions of fat bitches.

696
00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.120
Why don't they just throw a

697
00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:13.360
bunch of fat bitches?
Gabby's just shredded.
Just fuck it up.

698
00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:17.410
She's 105 and Oh,
you don't want to run it.

699
00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.260
Drug tests on her and either either,

700
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:24.040
maybe that surgery that she had made a weakened or chin too,

701
00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:28.150
like she used to have.
Yeah,
she had blood.
She had [inaudible].
It looks like,

702
00:40:28.151 --> 00:40:32.770
at least that's the rumor.
What does it say?
I'm not trying,
I'm not lying,
nor his.

703
00:40:32.771 --> 00:40:36.400
Tito UFC called my manager last time to see if I would fight Rhonda at one 35

704
00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:39.310
December 5th hey Tito.
Hey sideboard.

705
00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:42.970
How about you take a lesson in business one on one and if you'll see if the UFC

706
00:40:42.971 --> 00:40:46.150
ask you that,
you don't fucking blurt it out and tell the world till it's done.

707
00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:49.300
Because now Dana came out and was like,
no,
I never said that.
Did he?
Yes.

708
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:55.540
Bring it up.
So either way you're not getting,
it's not,
she's not supposed to do.

709
00:40:55.541 --> 00:40:58.840
You're not supposed to do.
That's the number one.
As soon as the ULC says,
hey,

710
00:40:58.841 --> 00:41:02.370
we're thinking about you fighting whoever,
please don't say anything right now.

711
00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:06.660
Let's be honest.
Right now the girl that buff natural,

712
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:10.210
naturally traumatic,
more been wrestling since she was a kid.

713
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.500
Brian's been doing judo sentence as possible.

714
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:16.600
When I put my hand on Sarah McMahon.
It's like Gleason t bow.
Wow.

715
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:20.020
She's just possible.
Wow.
I don't know.
I'm not an endocrinologist.

716
00:41:20.021 --> 00:41:21.970
They've been doing it with most girls would like to me

717
00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:27.700
that Jesus.
Okay,
let's watch.

718
00:41:27.701 --> 00:41:31.480
This shit is weird that you have women ring girls when women are fighting.

719
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.100
I think shop big brown.
You need to strip down dude.
I'll

720
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:37.060
<v 2>do it man.
That I'll fucking do it.</v>

721
00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.860
I wear Reebok speedo.
Did you,

722
00:41:39.861 --> 00:41:43.460
are you bullshit me about Reebok saying that I have to wear their shit?
Ah,
no.

723
00:41:43.461 --> 00:41:44.910
In the interview that said,
uh,
we,

724
00:41:44.911 --> 00:41:48.500
we rush this out to get the fighters done and then they said,
you know,

725
00:41:48.501 --> 00:41:51.250
next we didn't even think about Joe Rogan or the ring card girl.

726
00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:53.720
That's another thing.
Just like you were saying about Cyborg,

727
00:41:53.721 --> 00:41:57.530
not talking about that.
They shouldn't talk about that,
you know,
don't like,

728
00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:00.920
they'll see the whole thing super sloppy because people,
they're like,

729
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.560
we know we're taking a lot of criticism on the outfit,
stuff like that,

730
00:42:03.561 --> 00:42:06.920
but they spell people's names wrong.
I know she's stuffing Sara McMann.

731
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:11.600
She's stuffing her.
Look at her man.
Has his bad ass.
Damn.
She Brazilian?
Yeah.

732
00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:15.510
Wow.
Oh,
she just slept.
She released it wrinkled.

733
00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:19.940
But basically what the Reebok Guy said is,
you know,
we rushed to get this done,

734
00:42:19.941 --> 00:42:21.680
so we've made some mistakes,
but we're learning.

735
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:24.740
Why are you trying to scare up Joe?
It doesn't matter.
I'm not at all.

736
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.670
You can't really scare Joe.
Listen man,
he's different because the,
you know,

737
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:29.810
Reebok can say,
hey Joe,

738
00:42:29.811 --> 00:42:31.940
jump and he's not going do that with just not do the wins.

739
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:34.250
It wouldn't be that hard.
You know?
I would go and watch,

740
00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:39.251
I watched the see a Jo watched the Rhonda a weigh ins from the audience because

741
00:42:40.071 --> 00:42:43.640
they had a Brazilian guy that was injured.
Did you do it?
Not so good.
Oh,
he needs,

742
00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:47.570
he needs work on his enthusiasm.
You know,
Joe Rogan is fine.
I don't know.

743
00:42:47.571 --> 00:42:50.620
I don't understand the language,
you know,
speaking.
Wow.
This extra man,

744
00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.870
just trying to get her back,
take it back and lose the position.
Is this,

745
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:57.500
you know Sarah mcavity?
I'll tell you what's going on the bottom.
What's her name?

746
00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:00.480
Amanda Nunez.
Tough girl.
She stopped,

747
00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:05.320
but we only test them and then you watch Rhonda.
It's like Bro,
Lebron verse,

748
00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:08.660
I'll fucking pickup game in the park.
It's not called Raman versus me.

749
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:13.370
Lebron was going to play.
He's got,

750
00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:16.910
these girls are strong and fast.

751
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:22.640
You know Lebron had a big part in that.
Amy Schumer trainwreck can be seen it.

752
00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:23.450
Yeah,
I love it.

753
00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:27.690
The first 45 minutes I was screaming and it was amazing.

754
00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:31.400
Smoothies are great for 45 [inaudible] the best,

755
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:35.330
but then you know when when you get really Raunchy,

756
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:40.130
oh she get her in the eye.
She had the,

757
00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:44.160
I'm dude,
she caught it with a bomb.
Damn.
She's a pretty big underdog,
too.

758
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:47.590
Tough tennis.
They're all tough as this tough dude.
She is.

759
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.750
So Sarah was an underdog.
Sarah's not good on the bottom.

760
00:43:50.751 --> 00:43:53.450
No series was the favorite.
I thought.
Well she probably,
yeah,

761
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:54.740
because she Olympic medals,

762
00:43:54.741 --> 00:43:57.680
but she's not very good at the bottom and I noticed that in the Meesha fights.

763
00:43:57.681 --> 00:43:59.810
That's a good bag for a long time.
That's a professional.

764
00:43:59.811 --> 00:44:03.590
She's getting fucked up bro.
Name names Bressler who's really good on the bottom.

765
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:07.670
It's,
that's the problem.
Dominant.
Yeah.
They're so used to being on top.

766
00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.380
They spend all their time dominate.
Sarah's moving

767
00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.890
taps to it.
She's good.

768
00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:19.160
She's going to tap

769
00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:26.890
into the drafts.
A bad pitch right there.
Amanda.
She makes a shit

770
00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:32.010
to look at that.
She battled her while she

771
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.700
<v 1>just said she was the girl to be Rhonda.
Wow.
Dan Dear Meryl says,</v>

772
00:44:35.701 --> 00:44:36.940
I got a whole new respect for that.

773
00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:40.710
I can't say she's the girl to be Rhonda because she just got ground out by

774
00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:45.260
Meesha Tate.
Oh,
she's American top team.
Powerful Amanda.
Good flour

775
00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:50.190
groundwork,
right.
The love that she did.
This hopped over the fence.
Fuck it.

776
00:44:50.191 --> 00:44:54.300
Mike Brown.
Good for her.
She's wicked.
She's wicked man.
That's one 35 huh?

777
00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:57.930
Then when she got a new star,
great.
Got a new star right there.

778
00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:02.390
One 35 but she was a wrestler so she was striking.

779
00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:07.220
That bitch fucked up.
[inaudible] McMahon hits hard for longer,

780
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:11.220
right?
That he should take to fill up.
She's going to beat Ronda.

781
00:45:11.221 --> 00:45:14.880
I'm saying I wouldn't want to watch that shit.
I want to watch.

782
00:45:14.881 --> 00:45:17.250
See are getting fucked us this,
watch this.
Watch this.
Watch this.

783
00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:24.570
Oh Damn.
Look at this.
Damn.
She,
Sarah McMahon broke me.

784
00:45:24.571 --> 00:45:29.170
She's orbital your yeah,
her.
I was fucked up from that.
She hits hard,
man.
First.

785
00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.250
Manda battered or dude,
dude,
you know what I don't want to see happen,

786
00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:35.210
Paige vynanse fight.
Uh,
Yolana No.
Yes.

787
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:39.530
Paige is so damn hot.
So auto is just tall.

788
00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:44.320
I would love to see,
I would love to say,
Hey,
you know what?

789
00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:46.770
[inaudible] is a fucking hustler.

790
00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:51.600
She might be able to pull it off,
but you know what?
I put all my money on Joanna.

791
00:45:51.601 --> 00:45:52.920
I'll never bet against her.
I,

792
00:45:52.921 --> 00:45:55.860
but the bottom line is I would love that fight was coming on right now.

793
00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:58.980
If you just get paid Transat Joanna,
I can't say,
like I said,

794
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:02.710
you'd freak the fuck out of fights.
It's not competitive.

795
00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:06.150
You wouldn't really care for the fight.
No,

796
00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.870
because I don't see his face get destroyed.

797
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:10.680
Have you ever seen another female fighter?

798
00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:15.270
I've never seen another female destroy a girl's face.

799
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:19.620
Like you wanted it to Pandiya effort.
That's the beautiful part of the game.

800
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:24.140
That's why we love the game.
I know when it's a bad ass.
Come on as a funnel,

801
00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.810
as a fighter.
Paige vanzant trying to beat up everybody.
Who did you,

802
00:46:27.811 --> 00:46:31.690
she just smashed a,
who did she beat?
She'd be at least Herrick

803
00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:38.190
upper.
Yeah.
She beat the shit out.
Where you sat.
That was different.
It was Derek.

804
00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.490
Is that pretty,
is that what you're saying?
No,
I didn't say that.

805
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:45.810
I think Johan that go on is a monster and she's going to throw elbows at pages

806
00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:50.010
dying piece face.
I agree with Brendan.

807
00:46:50.011 --> 00:46:51.190
100% of that.
All right.

808
00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:53.430
I just think you would shouldn't fight someone if you're now ready.

809
00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:57.120
And I think she's really learning him in May when you want as a six time world

810
00:46:57.121 --> 00:46:59.690
moy.
Moitai cause she's just not,
she's going to have the experience you,

811
00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:04.620
it's going to take down defense is fuck you a page like for fights and then,

812
00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.920
and then give her,
give her hers.
I have to be hard.

813
00:47:07.921 --> 00:47:12.921
Donk who is Ben Saunders striking coach now I hung out with them at the Chicago

814
00:47:13.051 --> 00:47:14.920
show and we hung out.
He,
he mentioned that,
um,

815
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.230
Joanna was going and training with the Dutch guys at his gym free gears forever.

816
00:47:19.231 --> 00:47:23.820
They knew that she was going to be a stuff because she's this little girl from

817
00:47:23.821 --> 00:47:28.230
Poland training with all these giant monsters.
He said there was nobody her size.

818
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:32.230
She was in sparring with big dudes.
I'm like,
she's just,
she's just crazy.

819
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:34.960
And they knew,
man,
if she keeps it up,
they knew she would be.

820
00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.180
She wanted me over in that opinion of fight.
I was like,

821
00:47:37.181 --> 00:47:42.181
holy balls are seen a female lightspeed Har Har Donk say.

822
00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:47.380
That's why I'm saying Pena.
She's the best striker like period period in MMA.

823
00:47:47.381 --> 00:47:50.740
It's arguable.
I said that today and I did some UFC said that town shit today.

824
00:47:50.741 --> 00:47:53.820
I'm like,
she might be the best technical striker and all of them.

825
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:56.130
The Combo and trying to take down trends.

826
00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:00.690
You take her striking and our comp or take down the fence.
God Damn it.

827
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.040
She's terrible.
She's going to be very hard to beat.
Hey,

828
00:48:03.041 --> 00:48:05.230
she might not know you don't have a good story.

829
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:09.940
Is Jus Julianna Pena First Ronda Rousey.
Yeah.
That's a good story.

830
00:48:09.941 --> 00:48:10.420
Yes.

831
00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:14.350
Eventually she can get started because she was on the ultimate fighter with her.

832
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:17.560
You know,
she's Meisha Tate's training partner.

833
00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:22.630
She doesn't like Rhonda and you know what she is mentally as strong as is.

834
00:48:22.631 --> 00:48:26.400
You gotta be to go against someone.
Ronda,
she's very,
she's,
I'm telling you,

835
00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:30.970
I'm very impressed as Amanda Nunez and she's no joke.
No joke.
Are you kidding?

836
00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:35.710
Mcmahon's back to the drawing board and draws.
Good Lord.
Is she ever,
that's,

837
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:40.090
she has a rough story to every girl is going to be going over each other so much

838
00:48:40.091 --> 00:48:43.030
hair boys.
She has a rough story.
She rough story.
Yeah.
Her,

839
00:48:43.031 --> 00:48:45.580
I think her brother died or something like that and high school.

840
00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:49.330
That's why she started wrestling and some shit sucks.
Nunez crack too,
man.

841
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:52.290
Everybody want to thank,
I prepare their half.
It's fine.

842
00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:59.420
They're all getting better.
Madigan a bear.
I'm getting better now in the UFC.

843
00:48:59.421 --> 00:49:01.090

Thank Eh.
Brian Callin for exact thing.

846
00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:16.470
Here's my big inspiration is my pleasure for me to watch him so much so I wish

847
00:49:16.471 --> 00:49:20.640
he was here and to kiss him just one time.
His Lips.

848
00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:25.380

but a beautiful eyes.

849
00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:31.480
What would,

854
00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.260

855
00:49:58.261 --> 00:50:02.560

Flag

856
00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:07.860
things anybody's ever said.

857
00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:13.650
It's got that black hole while I did the podcast the day after,
right?

858
00:50:13.651 --> 00:50:17.490
Wasn't it the next day?
The next day,

859
00:50:17.491 --> 00:50:20.970
He's just so brilliant.
He called,

He's just,

860
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.740
he's just like the funniest fucking guy ever.

861
00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:25.890
He was on the podcast when we were talking about suicide.
It was fucked up.

862
00:50:25.891 --> 00:50:28.100
We're talking about knowing people died

863
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.120
<v 0>and I talked about this girl that I used to,
Dave that died and I said,
Joe,</v>

864
00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:33.830
do you know anybody that ever that ever,

865
00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:36.620
did you ever like date a girl and that she wound up killing himself?
He goes,

866
00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:40.670
They showed up.
They showed up.
You get my fucking,
he goes,

867
00:50:40.671 --> 00:50:42.080
I had chlamydia for seven years.

868
00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:45.900
He's going to fucking infesting digging your mouth.

869
00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.490
Funniest thing anyone's ever said in the podcast ever.

870
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:58.360
I can't breathe.
Tears are rolling down my face.
This is the,
as a pause.
He goes,

871
00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:59.700
no,
they shouldn't

872
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:08.770
talk about Ronda being some phenomenon.
MMA.
What about Joe?

873
00:51:08.771 --> 00:51:13.220
He fucking Diaz being a phenomenon,
man.
This followers are so,

874
00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:18.680
he's got some followers that would die for him and just super loose.
Periscope.

875
00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:22.640
He periscopes every morning and he smokes a bowl and periscope and he's got like

876
00:51:22.641 --> 00:51:25.850
2000 people watching him smoke weed every morning is the best comedian ever.

877
00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:29.600
Yeah,
I've seen them over ever.
I've seen them all.
I've seen everybody I seen,

878
00:51:29.601 --> 00:51:34.490
I've seen live.
I saw Kennison so I saw Hixon his prime.

879

880

I saw Rodney Dangerfield in his prime.
I saw these guys in his prime.

881
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:43.220
I think Joey's better than all of them.

882
00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:46.070
I think he's the funniest guy that's ever lived.
He's the crazy,

883
00:51:46.071 --> 00:51:49.330
I don't want to give up the bit because this new bill Cosby bit,

He's 100% of the times.

906
00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:08.390
If someone texts you something you're like,

907
00:53:08.391 --> 00:53:11.330
what is that mean is the only guy I talked to on the phone?

908
00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:17.930
Occasionally.
Occasionally,
but generally it's all texting.

909
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.600
You're than effect talk.
I talked to you occasionally.

910
00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:24.380
I talked to Brian on a fairly regular basis and I talked to you fairly regularly

911
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:25.880
and and that's it.

912
00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:29.640
They can junk and Dunkin and Ari and Ari case talked to Joey every day,

913
00:53:29.641 --> 00:53:31.620
sometimes two or three times a day to Ari.

914
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:35.270
Ari mumble so bad I can't talk to him on the phone.
I have to buy

915
00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.930
those.
Those grounds were fucking New York City,

916
00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:43.980
whatever cause he's still in the yard.
Yeah man.
Dude.

917
00:53:43.981 --> 00:53:48.870
Ari is bawling completely out of control.
His podcast is killing it.

918
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:52.560
It's always like top 15 top 20 on iTunes in the comedy section,

919
00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:57.060
selling out everywhere.
It goes on tour internationally for like a month.

920
00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:01.080
He's doing a month,
like in Australia doing a month in Scotland.

921
00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:02.760
Putrid his does whatever he wants.

922
00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:06.360
Has has an apartment in New York City that he's got somebody else at least is
it.

923
00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.590
While he's not there,
he has like a laptop.
He has my old couch.
Oh,
he sold it.

924
00:54:10.591 --> 00:54:14.440
He's not materialistic at all.
Like he's the most unmet materialistic guy,

925
00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.010
but he's got money for years now.

926
00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:20.720
He's just the saving it world away all his money because he doesn't spend that.

927
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:24.630
He's so frugal because I was trying to get her to buy a nice car.
I was like,

928
00:54:24.631 --> 00:54:24.931
dude,

929
00:54:24.931 --> 00:54:29.550
treat yourself to like a nice BMW three series here who come and try my car.

930
00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:32.670
I'll let you borrow my car for a few days of fruit will over here.

931
00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:36.470
Just give me the best.
He's always giving best.
She more like,

932
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:40.660
Joe's always been that way.
I think it works.
I don't like that.
You know what,
I,

933
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:43.420
I have the exact same way.
Me and Joe are a lot.
We,

934
00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:46.320
we have cars that have trash everywhere.

935
00:54:46.321 --> 00:54:51.180
Our office is a fucking disaster and I don't like to think about money.

936
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.270
I go like the day I went to cheesecake factory,
me and my wife and my son,

937
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:57.180
$40 check.
I tipped him $15

938
00:54:58.890 --> 00:55:03.050
$10 sorry.
Yeah.

939
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:05.100
Yeah.

940
00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:10.100
I'd leave a stone cold 50th I was going to say it on the spot 40 we were in

941
00:55:10.831 --> 00:55:13.710
Seattle and Joe,
check this out.
We're at the airport and see,

942
00:55:13.711 --> 00:55:17.850
I don't want me and Joe and we get coffee.
I just get a coffee and Joe goes,

943
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:18.881
he put a put,

944
00:55:18.881 --> 00:55:22.460
it gives the guy money and then I see him put something in a jar and he just get

945
00:55:22.461 --> 00:55:23.790
out of here and I really don't.

946
00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:28.410
I look and it's a hundred dollar bill on the tip jar,
and I go,
the fuck.
He goes,

947
00:55:28.411 --> 00:55:31.140
yeah,
I call that a love bomb.
Then I get the fuck out of there.

948
00:55:32.890 --> 00:55:33.760
He was so aggressive.

949
00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:37.080
I put $100 until I get the fuck out of there before they even know what the fuck

950
00:55:37.081 --> 00:55:41.810
happened.
Like aggressive.
I was like,
take it easy,
man.
[inaudible]

951
00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:46.590
guy who you don't want credit for it.
You don't want to see like,
Hey,

952
00:55:46.591 --> 00:55:49.760
Matt was office.
Give me 100 bucks.
You don't even want to get doing.

953
00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:50.723
Get out of it.
Yeah.

954
00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:54.200
Get out of there and know that when you're over by gate 22 this guy's going to

955
00:55:54.201 --> 00:55:58.260
have a good feeling.
It was too.
I love you for that.
You don't feel it,

956
00:55:58.261 --> 00:56:00.750
but they feel it.
If you can make someone feel happy like that,

957
00:56:00.751 --> 00:56:01.920
but it doesn't bother you at all.

958
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:05.730
Whether or not you have an extra 20 or an extra 50 or a hundred I don't know.

959
00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:06.040
I don't,

960
00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.970
it doesn't mean cal or talking about that real killer Tom about this the other

961
00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:11.280
day,
like if,
if someone needs money,
I just give it to them.

962
00:56:11.281 --> 00:56:14.850
I don't give a fuck me.
I stopped loaning people money a long time ago,

963
00:56:14.851 --> 00:56:17.430
but I've given it give it to you.
I don't expect anything back.

964
00:56:17.431 --> 00:56:19.080
But because if I expect to get it back,

965
00:56:19.081 --> 00:56:21.810
then we're going to have prompts and then there becomes this weird kind of

966
00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:24.010
dynamic between us.
So if I just give it to

967
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:26.560
<v 2>people and then whatever,
man.
Yeah,</v>

968
00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:29.410
I've had a few friends see what happens to red wine.
You just keep drinking it.

969
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:33.990
I mean,
I'm doing good.
I'm not Joe Rogan,
scrooge McDuck rich,
but I knew,

970
00:56:33.991 --> 00:56:37.100
all right,
you guys are on your way.
That podcasts is goddamn gigantic.

971
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:40.210
I see those shirts all the time.
I see the sex,

972
00:56:40.211 --> 00:56:43.520
drugs and podcasting shirt the most.
For some reason I see that bitch everywhere.

973
00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:48.330
Look that sexy motherfucker.
A lot of this is a good God damn fight.

974
00:56:48.830 --> 00:56:52.660
Great fight.
Who else is that?
Is that our Arlovski and Frank Mir on this one too?

975
00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:54.630
Dotson and mighty mouse.
Yes.

976
00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:58.330
A Lawsky and Frank Mir on that car because it sucks cause these are two of the

977
00:56:58.331 --> 00:56:59.380
most talented guys in the UFC.

978
00:56:59.381 --> 00:57:03.100
Mighty mouse might be the most talented in the world by far in the UFC,

979
00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:06.490
but it's not.
These two can't carry a pen,
a paper view.
They just can't.

980
00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:09.670
You know what it is,
man.
I really think that it's going to take some time,

981
00:57:09.671 --> 00:57:12.550
but I think that mighty mouse,
he's such a good guy.

982
00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.340
He's so well spoken and Dotson is the same thing.

983
00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:17.980
Dodson is just spectacularly fucking talented.

984
00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:20.290
He's just gonna take a while before people realize it.

985
00:57:20.291 --> 00:57:23.920
But I talk about it as enthusiastically as I physically can.

986
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:26.770
I know I'm very,
I'm very high on this fight.

987
00:57:26.771 --> 00:57:30.430
I can't wait for this fight like some Russian destroyer to come in and make it

988
00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:34.170
happen.
[inaudible] the fuck he got popped for ped.

989
00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.100
She tested hot EPO.

990
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:40.600
He was on EPO and mighty mouse still ran a train on it for five rounds.

991
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:44.650
Chinese guy comes in with like some serious [inaudible] you need a ride.

992
00:57:44.651 --> 00:57:45.484
You know what I'm saying?

993
00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:51.460
Julie outfit brothers going at it at the flyweight.
We need it.
It's tough,
man.

994
00:57:51.461 --> 00:57:54.950
It's a tough sell Brazilian of we see a Brazilian.
That would be interesting.

995
00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:57.040
More Small Brazilians killing the game.

996
00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:00.560
A little tiny Brazilian who's killing everybody was like,
that'd be dope.
Yeah.

997
00:58:00.561 --> 00:58:04.460
You said something very controversial recently that the MNA media picked up on

998
00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:09.640
surprise.
You said that the Brazilians are,
they have a four p four part diet.

999
00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:14.850
You're like Jujitsu's wrestling steroids and the other one God,

1000
00:58:14.981 --> 00:58:19.420
you guys saying you got heat for that guy to get death threats.
There's one guy,

1001
00:58:19.421 --> 00:58:22.090
he's like,
fuck you mother fucker.
You fucking fuck mother.
Fuck.

1002
00:58:22.091 --> 00:58:26.260
He was buck 50 times.
I was like,
I get death threats now.
I got a legit point,
man.

1003
00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:31.110
What you got to look?
You know,
I've heard Matt accusations behind the scenes.

1004
00:58:31.111 --> 00:58:34.960
It's like mad accusations and I can't talk about it cause it's not responsible,

1005
00:58:34.961 --> 00:58:39.550
but it's that old thing from the fucking CNC music factory song.

1006
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:43.710
Things that make you go,
yes.
No,

1007
00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:47.770
I just don't throw these bombs out without having information behind it.

1008
00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:50.110
But again,
there's certain stuff I can't talk to about.

1009
00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.820
So I throw out these bombs and I get the people just talking shit to me.
Like,

1010
00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:55.880
Nigga,
I didn't just make this shit up.
That's idiots.

1011
00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:59.980
There's stuff I can't talk about it.
You're coming from a place of knowledge.

1012
00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:03.500
Some due to works in a tire shop was talking shit.
Yes.

1013
00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:08.110
There's never strapped on a cup.
Yeah.
If anybody's allowed to talk about it,

1014
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:12.470
you know,
this is a big fight for me,
man.
I really am into this fight,
this,

1015
00:59:12.790 --> 00:59:17.530
this last fucking Goddamn fast.
He's ridiculous.
And not only that,

1016
00:59:17.531 --> 00:59:21.650
John got to Knox,
mother fucker's dead.
We got him,
he knocked out Tj Dillashaw.

1017
00:59:21.651 --> 00:59:22.130
Look at this.

1018
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:25.490
<v 1>Look at that.
Come on son.
Who the fuck naps guys out?
I agree.</v>

1019
00:59:25.491 --> 00:59:29.610
Why wait that he's so powerful.
Ma,
me and him is my second fight.
Ever.

1020
00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:30.710
Look at him.
Listen to this.

1021
00:59:30.711 --> 00:59:34.700
My second fight ever in Washington and I have my headphones on and John Dodson.

1022
00:59:34.701 --> 00:59:36.770
I in the same locker room because Greg Jackson was corners.

1023
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:38.630
It was by far my biggest fight at the time.

1024
00:59:38.631 --> 00:59:42.800
Only second fight ever and I was fighting this Olympic wrestler.

1025
00:59:42.801 --> 00:59:47.660
Johnny Curtis and I have my headphones in and I'm so nervous.
I'm like,
fuck man,

1026
00:59:47.661 --> 00:59:48.411
this wrestler man,

1027
00:59:48.411 --> 00:59:52.220
he's got to dry hump the fuck out of me and I'm getting ready to walk out and

1028
00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:54.860
I'm listening to Rihanna in my headphones.

1029
00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:58.010
I forget which one was like more of an uptempo.
Cheers.

1030
00:59:59.570 --> 01:00:03.800
Tim Johnson's mustache.
Before we go any
closer,

1031
01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:06.860
Kudos to you.
Pseudo continued continued,

1032
01:00:06.861 --> 01:00:09.950
so I'm walking up for this big fight in John Dodson goes,
hey,

1033
01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:13.360
we don't know each other very well at all.
He goes,
hey,
hey,
listen to Rihanna men.

1034
01:00:13.361 --> 01:00:18.050
I went,
yeah.
He goes,
fuck,
that's lame.
I went,
oh,
I don't know.
Oh,
thanks man.

1035
01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:21.500
And they just kept walking.
I'll never forget that and then fucked as lazy.

1036
01:00:21.501 --> 01:00:24.550
I was like,
fuck,
that's lame.
That's fun.
Literally as I'm walking,
well,

1037
01:00:24.551 --> 01:00:27.440
he's been beyond the guns,
so he's a silly yes dude.
He's silly.

1038
01:00:27.441 --> 01:00:30.190
He's working at buffalo wild wings at the time.
Wow.

1039
01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:33.500
Both their mustache off this guy.
Usually it's a pedophile thing.

1040
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:36.100
He's an ass it off and we'll show handsome.

1041
01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:38.200
You're Charlotte's a bad motherfucker too.
He's a team.

1042
01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:41.990
Take down big boys with Hendrix.
One Hendrix,
Tyron Woodley fight.
Ooh,

1043
01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:44.930
that's interesting.
That's a great fat.
It is.
Look at that.

1044
01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.570
Goddamn Tim Johnson Mustache.
You know what?

1045
01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.200
Real soon that that's going to be popular amongst high high school kids.
I agree.

1046
01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:55.550
100% mustaches.
Oh,
I'll be the first one here with that bullshit mustache.

1047
01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:58.820
Just fucking,
this doesn't look good on you sir.
Well,
you don't know.
Slowly.

1048
01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:02.100
So once it goes down,
it goes down.
I've seen it go on,

1049
01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:05.720
like saying that it's going to come back.
It doesn't come in.
That place does.

1050
01:01:05.721 --> 01:01:08.930
He could.
You could work on that.
I figured out a way to,
it comes in,

1051
01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:10.000
it comes into my contest.

1052
01:01:11.050 --> 01:01:14.330
I know what's going to happen is it's going to come and it's going to be
popular.

1053
01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:17.030
Everyone's going to have one does Tom Selleck mustaches.

1054
01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:20.330
Then it's going to get played out too and it's going to be gross and then the

1055
01:01:20.331 --> 01:01:23.180
new young kids are going to look at you when you're older.

1056
01:01:23.181 --> 01:01:27.240
What that mustache and right back when he looks at how an overgrowing musketeer

1057
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:29.790
everything when it comes to style and fashion.

1058
01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.740
Cause at one point the Burt Reynolds a child molester mustache.

1059
01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:36.080
What you fucking know?
They kind of came in.

1060
01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:39.080
They came back for a little while and then they fade it back out.

1061
01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:44.230
Look at beards are so in.
Who would ever know they're coming back?

1062
01:01:44.231 --> 01:01:45.240
We had the numbers would look cool.

1063
01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:49.190
Beards are going away now though because beards are like a fucking tramp stamp

1064
01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:53.150
like everyone.
So everyone has one.
Beards are pretty strong.

1065
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:57.590
I'm telling you they're not man.
It's on its way.
Yeah.
The Way Joe is,

1066
01:01:57.591 --> 01:02:01.630
where his is what's in right now.
I'm a trend setter.
Bitch.
I've been doing this.

1067
01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:04.260
It's called being read Gq every week,

1068
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:10.880
five o'clock so yeah.
Oh my God.
I'm going to rule that shit.
Yeah.
What about me?

1069
01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:13.940
What she was doing five o'clock before.
It was cool because I was lazy.

1070
01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.890
I'm not going style.
That's what I just said,

1071
01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:19.450
which is just said that that's called being lazy.
Oh really?

1072
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:21.540
You didn't even listen.
Oh my God.

1073
01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:26.690
I'm ripping off your subconsciously repeated punchlines.
It's seconds later.

1074
01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:29.510
It's an echo.

1075
01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:35.220
The beard and skinny jeans is like a tribal fricking band.
Tattoo.

1076
01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:38.700
Cardigans went away.
They were in for a while.
Guys.

1077
01:02:38.701 --> 01:02:42.360
We're trying to look lame on purpose rolled up.
Pants seem to be in.

1078
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:46.320
A lot of guys are rolling up the bottom.
Oh,
she's not mad at that.

1079
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:49.710
I got to turn you on.
Turn you on to these fucking jeans.

1080
01:02:49.711 --> 01:02:53.200
They're called barbell jeans.
I just started wearing shit was tight to wait.

1081
01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:55.350
What are they mother fuckers,
dude,

1082
01:02:55.351 --> 01:02:58.980
these are out there made out of like the stretchy.
Oh,
and then they bounce back.

1083
01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:03.420
I sweat pants.
No restriction.
Stretchy Jean.
Totally.

1084
01:03:03.421 --> 01:03:05.310
100% has been wearing them for a while now,

1085
01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.280
but do the loose a good stretchy jeans street.

1086
01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:12.060
Good for turning side six guys for guys.
What?
You get jumped by Ninjas?

1087
01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:14.650
Don't worry about it man.
Like for real,

1088
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:17.640
for the most comfortable jeans I've ever worn by.
When did

1089
01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:24.310
tramp stamps get uh,
like a gross on a dude.
What year on

1090
01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:34.090
your memory is?
No,

1091
01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:36.173
no.

1092
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:40.980
I wish it could be your lower back arch your back like your lips and let me see

1093
01:03:40.981 --> 01:03:41.830
what's going on.

1094
01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:46.350
Nothing.

1095
01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:50.130
I'm just checking that he had a back cause you defended the shit on his cock.

1096
01:03:50.131 --> 01:03:52.230
Sick from doing the guard.
No.

1097
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:56.730
One point it wasn't not cool.
It was probably was never.

1098
01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:01.410
But at one point nobody had never cool bro.
No.
For males,

1099
01:04:01.411 --> 01:04:06.300
it's always been
telling me the first dude that got a tramp stamp,

1100
01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:09.400
people thought he was gang.
He came to his daddy's buddies.
My cat.

1101
01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:13.290
That's a bad idea,
bro.
If you're a Tommy right away,
right away,

1102
01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:17.190
right away was never cool.
Now if a girl has it,
I I see a girl with that.

1103
01:04:17.191 --> 01:04:20.190
I'm like,
Yo,
do you have good pants now?
My Dad sucks.
Cool,
let's talk.

1104
01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:24.630
I do those kinds of guys,
but for a girl even,

1105
01:04:24.631 --> 01:04:28.520
it's kind of not cool right now.
Well now it's a little slutty.

1106
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:33.530
Girls.
Girls still get no Sam.
No,

1107
01:04:33.930 --> 01:04:38.730
I don't even get them.
Listen,
if they hit the risk at an all time low ribs,

1108
01:04:38.731 --> 01:04:41.070
right?
I think if we saw a graph of the tramp stamp,

1109
01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.670
you see 1993 the fucking pink and then Bam,

1110
01:04:44.671 --> 01:04:48.340
that's run by 2015 that's it's fucking screwed.

1111
01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:51.390
Where do you get them?
It's true.
There's not as many,

1112
01:04:51.391 --> 01:04:54.900
but if a girl has something artistic back,
they're like really good work.

1113
01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:59.250
It's like to,
the tribal stuff's Kinda like,
um,
why are you doing that back there?

1114
01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:01.640
But every now and then you'll see something that looks really good.

1115
01:05:01.641 --> 01:05:05.310
He's like a Yakuza Tattoo.
That is so rare.

1116
01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:08.580
I don't give a shit if a girl has a tramp stamp.

1117
01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.820
If she's who gives a fuck if she should started a website,

1118
01:05:12.010 --> 01:05:15.780
still good tramp stamps.com I'm sure it's out cook is though.
It is.
Now.

1119
01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.140
Let's see if really good Trump's,

1120
01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:22.570
<v 2>I don't care if you imagine a guy,
a hot chick,</v>

1121
01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:25.750
she's cool.
She's making you laugh and then you turn around,
you know she has,

1122
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.870
and then you're like,
oh no,
I'm fucking,
I'm out of this bitch.
Oh No,
no.

1123
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:32.950
It's what guys,
really good.
Tramp stamp.com does not exist.

1124
01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:36.910
Anyone listening get booked it.
Hey,
hey,

1125
01:05:36.911 --> 01:05:41.260
this heavyweight fights that probably not going to lie because they're both

1126
01:05:41.261 --> 01:05:44.390
wrestlers knocked out.
Let's see what this fire,

1127
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:47.990
you have a trip that she's pretty much,
no.

1128
01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:51.090
Did you see the new Brazilian ring card girl?
Which one?

1129
01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.170
New One.
Tim Johnson and Jared Rochelle.
Yeah.

1130
01:05:56.171 --> 01:05:57.900
Well there was a bunch of really pretty ones,
man,

1131
01:05:57.901 --> 01:06:02.500
for this new one I just saw the other day,
I almost fell on my seat.
Tim Johnson.

1132
01:06:02.530 --> 01:06:04.210
Jared Rochelle,
Tim Johnson's one.

1133
01:06:04.211 --> 01:06:09.040
It looks like Bronson from that Australian movie.
English movie.
Was it English?

1134
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:13.630
English,
yeah.
Big Fat Guy.
Tom Hardy was the actor,
right?
Correct.

1135
01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:19.030
English.
It was like a couple of big white guys.
Big,

1136
01:06:19.031 --> 01:06:23.080
big was big.
Fucking giant white.
Lot of flesh flying around.
Right now.

1137
01:06:23.330 --> 01:06:24.220
Lot of stakes,

1138
01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:27.700
like this is a different stakes when you're fucking dealing with a 230 pound man

1139
01:06:27.701 --> 01:06:30.850
punched near Right Brennan.
Yeah.
Jab will rock your world.

1140
01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.980
You were talking about that about the two 25 divisions.

1141
01:06:32.981 --> 01:06:34.390
You've got a good point man.
I think that's,

1142
01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:39.090
that's exactly the right weight to I think 25 minutes because he's talking
about,

1143
01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.210
you know,
if,
if I weigh in at,
you know,

1144
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:45.940
I've waited and as light as to two 31 to 32 and then I finally guys to 65

1145
01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:49.840
basically 35 pounds,
30 pounds heavier.
That's insane.

1146
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:51.510
And you would get a lot of those guys cut and wait.

1147
01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:54.490
Then you would get a lot of guys,

1148
01:06:54.491 --> 01:06:57.520
I mean we have guys that have cut to get to two 65 right?

1149
01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:02.560
Oh well Tim Silvia [inaudible] so Paul Laley,
he just lost,
right?

1150
01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:05.740
He had to cut the two to 65 I was there when Tom,

1151
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:07.570
Derek Palae when Tim Silvia was,

1152
01:07:07.571 --> 01:07:12.571
I was most muscular best when it was like when he beat Rico and like those those

1153
01:07:12.611 --> 01:07:15.370
days.
Tim Silvia was giant and he was look at that guy.

1154
01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:18.650
He used to cut way to get to two 65 a lot of people sleep on Tim.
Sylvia,

1155
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:21.550
I'll tell you what the t the Tim Silvia that beat beaker Rodriguez,

1156
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:23.510
he was a monster.
One of the best heavyweights,

1157
01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:26.870
especially at a time would be one of the hardest heavyweight subbies show

1158
01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:32.960
eight something crazy like that.
Crazy.
Take down a fence.
Great.
Stand up.

1159
01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:37.780
That motherfucker was bad that Kim Sylvia and Sylvia and get enough credit hamus

1160
01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:39.880
fuck super game breaks his arm.

1161
01:07:39.881 --> 01:07:41.240
He's trying to punch them in the other name and no.

1162
01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:45.100
Do you remember the Nigga verified?
Yes.
I don't know Carolyn guilty.

1163
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:49.250
How cause he reversed it.
He bade them into it and reverse guillotine and pay it.

1164
01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.310
Hell called backpack.
Backtrack.

1165
01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.420
How was it when the went up from half guard and he let him get up and then got

1166
01:07:54.421 --> 01:07:59.260
on him.
How did he get to half guard?
I Fall Garden.
Did he pull half guard?

1167
01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:03.100
Pulled Garden?
He got hit.
He got tagged to get hurt.
He pulled guard?
No,

1168
01:08:03.101 --> 01:08:04.720
he just,

1169
01:08:04.721 --> 01:08:08.760
when fresh shitty single and then he panko sweats.

1170
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:13.540
She got on top right top half and then Guillotine de [inaudible] the kitchen

1171
01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:15.550
couldn't take him down.
Didn't anybody

1172
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:18.800
<v 1>didn't tell you was fucking them up standing so,</v>

1173
01:08:18.801 --> 01:08:21.530
and he couldn't take him down and he was like,
I'm losing this motherfucker.

1174
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:24.530
I can't take them down.
So what did he do?
What he needed?

1175
01:08:24.531 --> 01:08:25.840
He said I got to pull fucked to his back.

1176
01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.190
He wasn't guard by going with a fake takedown,

1177
01:08:28.230 --> 01:08:32.420
like a shitty single and then came and then he just swept him.

1178
01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:35.810
He outsmarted them and then baited him into sit up,

1179
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:38.770
grab the neck and choked him out too.
There's just like went right through.

1180
01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:42.530
He had to pull guard to get that fucking doubt.
God Damn tough is no guarantee.

1181
01:08:42.531 --> 01:08:46.580
You see the fight with Stephan struve.
I wanted to jump out of my TV and be like,

1182
01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:51.200
can someone please stop this man tough.
He's too tough for his own good.

1183
01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:55.490
He was getting way too tough.
Destroyed his body was getting just smashed.

1184
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:59.480
My face felt that made.
That made me feel sick.
Speaking of great heavyweights,

1185
01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:03.800
fade or talk with the UFC,
why they just stop this,

1186
01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:06.360
why they separated them.
The shows happened.

1187
01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:08.370
What do you think you just give them for doing right away and say,

1188
01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:11.960
fuck the world.
Fuck the world.
We're going to do it.
Fuck you guys.

1189
01:09:11.961 --> 01:09:15.050
Shut the fuck up.
Let's do it.
Have to be so aggressive.
Yeah.

1190
01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:16.010
It wasn't easy breath.

1191
01:09:16.810 --> 01:09:21.810
There's going to be the solid brother should have to earn his word at the top.

1192
01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:24.710
It's fade or no,
no one's really gonna say that.

1193
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:28.210
I had a guy call people complaining.
Oh,
no matter what you guys signed,

1194
01:09:28.570 --> 01:09:32.610
I lost a big foot row.
Rochelle.

1195
01:09:32.650 --> 01:09:35.610
Just trying to get the full amount Armour shirt.
Let go of these heavily out man.

1196
01:09:35.611 --> 01:09:38.710
He said full mount.
Oh yeah,
he is know for sure.
Like dumb.

1197
01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:42.230
He doesn't know what he's doing.
He has no,
he didn't go von flue choke.
Yup.

1198
01:09:42.610 --> 01:09:46.030
Jump over to the other side with both feet right here.
He's going fun for him.

1199
01:09:46.510 --> 01:09:51.500
He's got an arm triangle has been flu or Kamora go to the other side.

1200
01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:57.980
This side's von flue let go,
let go,
but he still saw,

1201
01:09:58.410 --> 01:10:01.130
I had a Fox reporter call me.
He's like,
Yo,

1202
01:10:01.131 --> 01:10:03.610
I want you to get your thoughts to fight and fade or like there's,

1203
01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:06.400
you got no interview man.
There's,
there's no thoughts.

1204
01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:08.360
I don't even deserve to fight that guy.

1205
01:10:08.361 --> 01:10:10.970
You just know you're a loose cannon and he'll say,
don't want to say some.

1206
01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:12.920
They know his drop some bombs,

1207
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:16.130
not when it comes to fade or though I was just like,
I got nothing for him,
man.

1208
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:19.010
I went disrespect that guy like that.
He's a fight for the title.

1209
01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:23.240
I think he goes right to them.
If they wanted you to find them.
If they said,
hey,

1210
01:10:23.241 --> 01:10:26.480
we need,
let's get fade or in here,
we'll introduce them up and yeah,

1211
01:10:26.481 --> 01:10:30.200
we'll get him Brendan shop.
You wouldn't do it.
I probably would for Fader,

1212
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:31.250
but then not going to do that.

1213
01:10:31.251 --> 01:10:35.840
They're going to get that he needs to go right to fade or
you never know.

1214
01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:40.580
You never know.
Shot with some good sides.
It doesn't make sense,
man.
I personally,

1215
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:45.110
I'll give them right to her doom.
Alaska's.
Yeah.
Let's not give him any,

1216
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:49.040
let's just go right to what he wants to rematch.
The story is the rematch.

1217
01:10:49.041 --> 01:10:51.560
That's the story.
Let me ask you this about these shorts.

1218
01:10:51.561 --> 01:10:55.600
Are you allowed to wear regular shorts or a tight shorts?

1219
01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:58.580
You Pick Reebok makes bowl.
Don't you think they should just go with only tight?

1220
01:10:58.581 --> 01:11:00.640
So the,
the grabbing them is no longer an issue.
No,

1221
01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:02.420
because some guys are self conscious about and they don't want,

1222
01:11:02.421 --> 01:11:04.610
they don't feel comfortable in tights.
So you're gonna force me.

1223
01:11:04.611 --> 01:11:09.020
We were fucking tight around or were
grabbing shorts.
It's not a promise,

1224
01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:13.280
not a game changer.
Problem.
Problem.
Oh it does come up occasionally.
Yeah.

1225
01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:13.980
But it's not like

1226
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.560
<v 2>holy shit.
These guys could grab him.
Show up.
Right?
Yeah.</v>

1227
01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:21.690
I feel like it's like 75 it's 1% or one 10th of 1% of clinch situations.

1228
01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:26.820
You can avoid that.
True.
I'm not trying to see fucking not a problem.

1229
01:11:26.821 --> 01:11:30.400
This dude with the mustache and some tights though it's bad for marketing

1230
01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:32.420
umbrella is Rochelle.

1231
01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:38.040
He's just so goddamn big.
They look like tights.
I like that American flag.

1232
01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:41.670
Just chest pull a chair.
It's an interesting,

1233
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:47.310
he's American.
Underneath his skin.
I got hard of American called America,

1234
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:51.270
not like this fucking guy from Australia that used to be in prison was that to

1235
01:11:51.271 --> 01:11:55.350
fight down that guy,
it looks like a moon looking Australian.

1236
01:11:55.351 --> 01:11:59.700
Prisoner body.
Oh Man.
As he could in his body is

1237
01:12:01.570 --> 01:12:04.930
it's got to relax.
Relax.

1238
01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:08.100
Not just a big guy fucking you,
but feeling his gut,

1239
01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:16.860
his gut wrap around the sides of your ass.
Fuck Chris,
touch your shirt.

1240
01:12:16.861 --> 01:12:18.720
And that went through my mind thought,
if I lose this guy,

1241
01:12:18.721 --> 01:12:21.120
he's the worst body I've ever seen.
How dare you?

1242
01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:26.600
How dare you just gotta be a God that God is.

1243
01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:29.610
All they have to do is just not eat the same foods.
You know what I mean?

1244
01:12:29.790 --> 01:12:32.940
That's the thing.
Oh,
we've kind of rocked him.
Oh,
the standard American diet.

1245
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:37.560
I mean these guys are big giant dudes.
But listen,
it's real simple.
Calories in,

1246
01:12:37.561 --> 01:12:40.050
calories out,
100% of your body's got.

1247
01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:41.670
If you're carrying around that much body fat,

1248
01:12:41.671 --> 01:12:44.070
you're taking in too many calories and the wrong kind of calendar,

1249
01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.610
which is still to 25 but is there a benefit?

1250
01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:51.060
Is there a benefit to carrying a little body fat like these guys are,

1251
01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:54.690
if you don't have a weight limit and maybe you're not as big as say a big foot

1252
01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:59.700
silhouette,
a little black boy,
Tony's just,
he said,
fuck it.
Fuck it.

1253
01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:04.860
A Tam for what Talary stitching looks but forget about looks.

1254
01:13:05.550 --> 01:13:08.070
Is there any benefit to having this extra weight?

1255
01:13:08.071 --> 01:13:09.960
Like especially if you're on top,
they'll know.

1256
01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:13.740
What about that much of a gifts rather unsightly,

1257
01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:18.780
unsightly difference.
I think it's rather than I ever had a backpack,

1258
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:22.020
you ever take your backpack off and he's just your laptop in it and some other

1259
01:13:22.021 --> 01:13:24.150
bullshit get off and you're like,
Ooh,
that's like,

1260
01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.770
that's like 10 pounds fighting me.

1261
01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:30.720
These guys might have like two or three fucking backpacks on all the time.

1262
01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:33.660
They just,
you're used to it.
And if they got rid of that shit,

1263
01:13:33.661 --> 01:13:37.860
they would move a lot better.
Yeah.
I mean,
it's not a cool,
that's a good analogy.

1264
01:13:37.861 --> 01:13:41.070
I never looked at it.
That's a great analogy.
Fucking good.

1265
01:13:41.071 --> 01:13:42.950
When you take a letter back back up and be like,

1266
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:46.920
holy fuck t shirt off and feel way better.
Yeah,
Dude,
look,

1267
01:13:46.921 --> 01:13:48.060
I've worn backpacks,

1268
01:13:48.061 --> 01:13:51.620
but when Rinella and I were hunting Brian and we were backpacks and carried

1269
01:13:51.621 --> 01:13:55.620
rifles for miles and miles,
it's annoying when you could take that stupid,

1270
01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:59.430
I don't know how much is a rifle way.
If you're like a feather,
25 30 pounds.

1271
01:13:59.431 --> 01:14:03.390
I don't know.
Yeah,
it was my rifles.
Pretty heavy to heavy rainfall.
When you,

1272
01:14:03.391 --> 01:14:06.390
when you take that rifle off and you set it down,
you know you're,

1273
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:11.170
you feel lighter.
Yeah,
but I think it weighs about 15 pounds,
right?
A rifle.
Well,

1274
01:14:11.171 --> 01:14:12.070
it's probably at least

1275
01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:17.680
<v 0>15 let's say 15 minutes of really heavy.
Right?
You're,
you're ready for that.</v>

1276
01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:21.330
I bet your rifles 20 it easily 20 pounds,
but either way,
the bottom line is,

1277
01:14:21.331 --> 01:14:23.380
is awkward and you're carrying all that weight around.

1278
01:14:23.381 --> 01:14:25.150
You've got fat around your legs,

1279
01:14:25.151 --> 01:14:28.270
that that impedes your legs from moving as quick as they should for sure.

1280
01:14:28.271 --> 01:14:29.770
Especially like kicks and stuff.

1281
01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:33.160
Could you imagine if you had to throw kicks and you had like five pairs of pants

1282
01:14:33.161 --> 01:14:35.860
on how good they mentoring that would be the,
well,
first of all,

1283
01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:39.120
and this is the way that Johnson dude,
that Belize not helping me,

1284
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.360
the way that Johnson Dude looks training for eight weeks now.

1285
01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:47.720
Think about when he says fucking retired.
So

1286
01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:52.570
I know this guy's in good shape,
shape.

1287
01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.500
He's in the middle of the second round still kickin once he retires,

1288
01:14:56.501 --> 01:15:01.090
it's the off to the races or didn't Bahar say that about Jake shields at Jake

1289
01:15:01.091 --> 01:15:05.470
shields was greased and he says about everyone and we thought that about Nate

1290
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:09.180
Marquardt but in a cool story,
they weren't Marquardt put rubber pants on.

1291
01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:13.810
He got a real good sweat before he went out the exact reason it was going to

1292
01:15:13.811 --> 01:15:17.520
come out.
They're sweaty.
Yup,
Yup.
With shave your legs and all that shit.

1293
01:15:17.710 --> 01:15:22.600
Not what happens in the forest now where we were suspended and they took away

1294
01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:25.960
his title.
They stripped him of his tied well deserved.
Well,

1295
01:15:25.961 --> 01:15:28.800
I think they're going to bring them.
I mean,
if they get rid of them.
Ooh,

1296
01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.390
Rah shot looking for that.
I had norm.
I think if they get rid of him,

1297
01:15:31.391 --> 01:15:35.110
he goes to Beltour.
I think Bella toward being crazy.
I agree.
For sure.

1298
01:15:35.111 --> 01:15:38.680
Crazy to not take him.
He's got so much controversy behind him.
The bad.

1299
01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:42.340
Everybody's afraid of them.
Let me just get them some IOWASCA therapy.

1300
01:15:42.341 --> 01:15:45.270
Take them out to the fucking jungle.
Give him a straw dog.

1301
01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:48.070
Give him a fucking coconut with a straw in it and it

1302
01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:53.080
goes,
hey,
I need,
he goes,
he goes,
I need you to do me a favor.
You need a what?

1303
01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:55.810
Paul Harry's ass.
I ain't whooping his ass.
No,
I'm scared of that.

1304
01:15:55.811 --> 01:15:58.450
My phone touches everyone else.
I'll give you steal.
I'll give you,

1305
01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:03.040
I'll give you ankle,
steel,
ankle girdles and goggles.

1306
01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:07.840
Will it make your organization look bad if you signed him?
Well,

1307
01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:10.800
the public turn against that organization when they start petitioning.

1308
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:15.610
Don't give a fuck.
That can share mucking Kimbo slice of Americano,

1309
01:16:15.611 --> 01:16:19.870
looking at 10 different looking at Texas Shit.
Lefthand stop defending.

1310
01:16:20.020 --> 01:16:24.490
It's thinking it's happened.
He look at that hand has thinking,
yeah,

1311
01:16:24.491 --> 01:16:26.470
but this is okay up here.
Up here is okay.

1312
01:16:27.790 --> 01:16:31.450
It's really when you get it down into your body that it's just,
you have no free.

1313
01:16:31.451 --> 01:16:33.780
That is he not know.
Oh there you go.

1314
01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:37.480
Sometimes guys just don't know about just sucking it up next to the guy's room

1315
01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:39.580
or he's exhausted.
That's possible.

1316
01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:42.730
But they're focused on the arm that's being attacked and said again using the

1317
01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:45.490
other one to escape.
That's the way out.
Well the guy on the bottom.
Yeah,

1318
01:16:45.491 --> 01:16:48.340
but the guy in the Bob,
the guy that's up,
once you have that double wrist lock,

1319
01:16:48.341 --> 01:16:51.250
you gotta concentrate everything on getting the fucking elbow to his side.

1320
01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:54.820
That's everything.
Getting the elbows to the side changes.
Yeah,

1321
01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:58.720
we'll bring it down.
I think he was going for the Americana.
Right,
so he's good.

1322
01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.000
If he brings it down towards the rib cage,

1323
01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:03.340
the amount of movement that you could tolerate,

1324
01:17:03.341 --> 01:17:08.020
so small range up here,
you could use so much range up there.

1325
01:17:08.021 --> 01:17:10.490
A guy can do right.
If a guy has really strong

1326
01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:13.880
<v 2>like some allosaur ovary,
motherfucker can get you up here and it'll hurt.</v>

1327
01:17:13.881 --> 01:17:15.920
You'll just tap just cause you know it's going to get ripped apart anyway.

1328
01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:20.150
But anybody can get you down here like once that thing gets down to your ribs.

1329
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:23.540
Boy though the tolerance of the shoulder joint movement,

1330
01:17:23.541 --> 01:17:26.310
the powerful Rhonda in another commercial.
Jesus.
That's her.

1331
01:17:26.370 --> 01:17:30.650
That's her fourth one.
I think.
What's,

1332
01:17:30.651 --> 01:17:33.590
what's overrated?
Well,
what the fuck's up with over and over him.

1333
01:17:33.591 --> 01:17:37.290
Junior dos Santos.
I just call it today.
I did a countdown thing for today.
What?

1334
01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:40.160
That's official.
I don't know,
but I just leaked it.
Sorry,

1335
01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.470
going down.
Oops.
When's that going down?

1336
01:17:45.471 --> 01:17:47.630
Sometimes I do things that don't ever take place.

1337
01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:51.710
Those were with a bunch of fights that I have John countdown shows for that have

1338
01:17:51.711 --> 01:17:54.740
never taken place.
I did two theoretical fights today.

1339
01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:57.230
I did two theoretical fights.
It may or may not happen,

1340
01:17:57.231 --> 01:18:00.220
but they haven't been signed.
That might've been one of them,
I forget.

1341
01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:03.950
And the other one was Cyborg.
No,
I didn't do that,

1342
01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:07.250
but I've done some before with the fights never took place or you know,

1343
01:18:07.251 --> 01:18:10.250
along the way it falls out.
Something falls out.
People get injured.

1344
01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:12.110
I think they've been fighting,

1345
01:18:12.111 --> 01:18:13.850
they've been trying for this fight for a long time.

1346
01:18:13.851 --> 01:18:17.930
But what's going on right now is that junior is coming back from surgery and

1347
01:18:17.931 --> 01:18:20.420
there had been the same at those cane fights.
Man,
I'm a big junior fan,

1348
01:18:20.421 --> 01:18:23.700
but he's never been the same.
That steep a fight that he barely won.
Yeah,

1349
01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.940
he's just,
no,
you can't go that many rounds.

1350
01:18:25.941 --> 01:18:29.390
You don't have so many rounds of career,
man.
It sucks.
It's 100% true.

1351
01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:33.410
There's no way anybody can avoid it.
It's just the way of the game.

1352
01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:37.190
And we've seen it too many times.
There's no one who gets out of it without,

1353
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:40.640
I mean even Mark Hunt,
when Steve Bay beat the shit out of Mark Hunt,

1354
01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:42.680
that was like,
you could see,

1355
01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:45.870
you could see that this is a different mark on this is this is a Mark Hunt

1356
01:18:45.871 --> 01:18:50.060
that's like at the end of the line.
Well,
I was talking to toffees.
He is,

1357
01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.900
I was talking to my buddy,
Cody is tough.

1358
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:56.580
My Buddy Cody goes to Vegas to have his brain research by some cleaning.
They're,

1359
01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:56.810
and they're,

1360
01:18:56.810 --> 01:19:01.310
they're using fighters and they're doing a lifetime test where you go every year

1361
01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:02.750
and they do five years,
10 years.

1362
01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:06.290
And Cody went back to her is five years until he did it five years ago.

1363
01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:11.000
And they said,
when you get knocked out,
it affects,
it depends on your,
on you,

1364
01:19:11.001 --> 01:19:14.780
on your brain.
It can affect certain parts.
For some people it's the way they act,

1365
01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:19.250
the way they think.
For a lot of people it's their motor motor skills.

1366
01:19:19.251 --> 01:19:21.620
It just depends from a lot of people if their speech.

1367
01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:26.510
So he was saying it's just a pans on the basis of the way your brain's design.

1368
01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:30.950
And he was telling,
uh,
Cody that there are certain fights and he was,

1369
01:19:30.951 --> 01:19:33.440
he's having Cody go through all this fight history and he goes,

1370
01:19:33.441 --> 01:19:37.040
there's certain fights where for whatever reason you took one punch and you will

1371
01:19:37.041 --> 01:19:39.440
never be the same at the hand.
Doesn't matter what you do,

1372
01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:43.310
but you will never be the same kinds of facts and certain parts of the brain

1373
01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:45.990
that will never ever be the same again.
Yeah.
We,

1374
01:19:46.230 --> 01:19:50.390
I had a bummer cure from mixed martial arts.com on the podcast and he was

1375
01:19:50.391 --> 01:19:55.100
talking to me about this guy that we knew that they told him he could never get

1376
01:19:55.101 --> 01:19:58.220
hit in the head again.
They're like,
don't ever get hit in the head again because,

1377
01:19:58.280 --> 01:19:59.113
because um,

1378
01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:04.040
of what she's been interest just crack too many times or one time too many or

1379
01:20:04.041 --> 01:20:07.040
you know,
you can get head kicked,
especially if you get head.
Yeah,
me hit,

1380
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.040
it's so hard and

1381
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.830
<v 0>nasty,
mean code time timeout with our original team.
You know,</v>

1382
01:20:10.831 --> 01:20:13.080
I'm not gonna mention names,
but we're going through it.
I'm like,
Bro,

1383
01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:16.890
who's doing well now?
Who's the same mentally that we can talk to?

1384
01:20:17.010 --> 01:20:19.890
There's not many men,
there's just not many guys are this.

1385
01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:23.130
And we had a ridiculous team.
If you're watching a guy like sailor Anthony,

1386
01:20:23.131 --> 01:20:24.960
Pettis,
Anthony Patterson,
and knocked out,

1387
01:20:24.961 --> 01:20:28.890
show on with that nasty head or knocked out Serone with that body kick.

1388
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:32.190
How many times can you let Anthony Pettis kick you before you never the same

1389
01:20:32.191 --> 01:20:35.250
again.
There's a certain amount of numbers you can get hit with.

1390
01:20:35.251 --> 01:20:38.680
That guy hits you so fucking fast and hard.
And when he hits guys,
they,

1391
01:20:38.710 --> 01:20:42.720
they slump,
they blam and then they slump.
Like Lozano.

1392
01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:45.810
Lozano is tough as fuck.
He watched that head kick and you go,
Geez,

1393
01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:50.460
the I quantified.
Yeah,
Joe.
It's like,
you know,
it's tough man.

1394
01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:54.450
But the thing that people forget,
you're only going to get those crazy hits.

1395
01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:57.870
The body doesn't know whether you're doing an training or you're doing it for

1396
01:20:57.871 --> 01:21:00.990
money.
He does not know if it counts for the EOC or in training.

1397
01:21:00.991 --> 01:21:05.130
What did you see the glory of Joseph Valtellina relinquish his title for?

1398
01:21:05.131 --> 01:21:07.950
Because of course can post concussion syndrome.
I didn't see that.

1399
01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:12.510
[inaudible] is the,
was the glove champ bad?
Not Super Bad.

1400
01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:15.450
Right up there with Nikki Holt's can.
They had a great fight and it's,

1401
01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:18.030
Nikki stopped him in the last round.
Nikki was winning the fight,

1402
01:21:18.031 --> 01:21:21.120
but it was a good fight and mark the ball and he's another guy that he fought.

1403
01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:24.480
He had kicked a bond,
knocked him down.
I mean,
he's fucking very,

1404
01:21:24.481 --> 01:21:27.030
very high level and he goes,
you know what,
I gotta stop.

1405
01:21:27.090 --> 01:21:30.090
I gotta stop and take some time off.
So he did commentary in this last card.

1406
01:21:30.490 --> 01:21:33.300
This is just a,
it's a reality that everybody wants to avoid.

1407
01:21:33.301 --> 01:21:35.970
It's a part of this because it's,
it's everything you do,

1408
01:21:35.971 --> 01:21:37.530
you throw your whole heart and soul into it.

1409
01:21:37.531 --> 01:21:41.070
It just doesn't seem fair that everything you love and everything that makes you

1410
01:21:41.071 --> 01:21:44.190
who you are and gives you your identity is also stealing your mind.

1411
01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:46.410
But that's why people respect fighters.
You know?

1412
01:21:46.411 --> 01:21:48.990
That's why we look up the fighters and that's why fighters are lot of peoples'

1413
01:21:48.991 --> 01:21:52.470
heroes.
But there's a price.
Well I taught.
So combat sports,

1414
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:55.050
there are two parts of your body that are not made for combat sports.

1415
01:21:55.051 --> 01:21:57.280
No matter what your knees and your head,
you know,

1416
01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:01.470
I thought you're going to say your Dick and your boss and your boss Dick in your

1417
01:22:01.471 --> 01:22:06.180
brain.
It's a bath to contact the back is worse because they can fix the knees.

1418
01:22:06.230 --> 01:22:09.960
If they can do some pretty good fixing as the nannies,
they can basically fix it,

1419
01:22:09.961 --> 01:22:14.280
fix everything except your brain when it's science these days almost there's

1420
01:22:14.281 --> 01:22:17.110
some backstory is really not an issue cause a bad point.

1421
01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:22.050
Always the first to go though,
aren't you?
Now your brain for sure.

1422
01:22:22.051 --> 01:22:24.750
It goes before everything is well,
your knees Kango early,

1423
01:22:24.751 --> 01:22:27.450
but they can fix them and make them better than they were before.

1424
01:22:27.451 --> 01:22:30.150
As long as you don't have too much meniscus.
Cartilage damage.

1425
01:22:30.330 --> 01:22:32.100
And now even then I lead,

1426
01:22:32.101 --> 01:22:35.580
they're generating the regenerating cartilage with these stem cell tree.
Crazy.

1427
01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:38.970
Yeah.
And this is like what we have now.
What's it gonna be like five years.

1428
01:22:38.971 --> 01:22:39.780
And I agree.

1429
01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:43.080
They all said they have a scanned percentage though of Devede scaffolding now

1430
01:22:43.081 --> 01:22:47.430
that they allows them to regrow a meniscus.
I want her to have to take a cadaver.

1431
01:22:47.460 --> 01:22:52.460
I think it's an artificial meniscus.
It's something that they create.
It's like a,

1432
01:22:52.470 --> 01:22:56.970
I think it's like they take the,
Oh shit this,
this fight is getting crazy.

1433
01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:00.690
Johnson just hit Rochelle with a bottle of a right hand.

1434
01:23:00.691 --> 01:23:01.830
Now he's got them down on the ground.

1435
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:06.040
I wonder what percentage of NFL football players have had a knee surgery.

1436
01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:11.200
<v 2>Knee surgery.
Yeah,
I mean a ton.
It's 90% they're getting hit in the knees though.</v>

1437
01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:15.100
Well they took away chop blocking.
Like you can't tack out the knees.

1438
01:23:15.101 --> 01:23:18.850
There's no chop looking.
There's certain rules they put in but you know scramble.

1439
01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.780
Crazy shit happens.

1440
01:23:19.781 --> 01:23:22.150
Just like sometimes guys don't mean to punch the guy in the back of the head.

1441
01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:25.750
Shit ass crazy shit happens.
And that happens in football too.

1442
01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:28.840
Well and then it fell analogous is running fucking 30 yards runs of four,

1443
01:23:28.841 --> 01:23:31.930
three and the 40 quiet,
quiet,

1444
01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:34.090
gnarly as fuck.

1445
01:23:34.091 --> 01:23:38.400
So not so crazy to think of how fucking powerful these guys are and love it.

1446
01:23:39.130 --> 01:23:42.670
It's insane.
It's insane.
I couldn't stop staring at Alden Smith.

1447
01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:46.000
He was in just a pair of shorts looking at the,
um,

1448
01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:48.610
the other we're talking about on a TV last night.

1449
01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:52.220
Is that the guy you were talking about?
Um,
the guy who got his super athlete.

1450
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:57.160
You got cut by the point.
I know she got in,
had a science night,
is released him,

1451
01:23:57.161 --> 01:23:58.660
but I can't talk about it,

1452
01:23:58.661 --> 01:24:02.080
but I have some shit that I know because I talked to Tarik.
He said coach.
Yeah.

1453
01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:06.850
And uh,
you'll see he's okay.
He's fine.
I love that guy.
It's a bummer.

1454
01:24:06.910 --> 01:24:10.400
I love that guy.
Oh Jesus.
Look at this fucking Taco one.

1455
01:24:10.450 --> 01:24:13.000
I didn't watch close enough.
I didn't watch close enough for you there.
Anytime.

1456
01:24:13.001 --> 01:24:15.790
A heavyweight fight the decision.
No one's a fan,
believe me.
Oh,

1457
01:24:15.791 --> 01:24:20.680
that was wild fight,
man.
That was a wildfire definition.
Wilds different.
But yeah,

1458
01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:22.080
that was kind of fun to watch.
Yeah.

1459
01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:27.070
I want say while it's not going to grade this,
my God,
just say it's not wild.

1460
01:24:27.370 --> 01:24:31.620
Gentlemen.
Have their bout his name rather is being rather,
I'm judgmental,

1461
01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:35.830
judgmental and eat.
Eating for sure.

1462
01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:40.950
Yep.
We tried to do this.
Where'd you get the punches and Chris?

1463
01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:47.020
Yeah,
we can hear that shit loud in class dude.
Yeah these are,

1464
01:24:47.021 --> 01:24:49.840
these are good microphone.
So this isn't your set up.

1465
01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:55.210
These are real microphones.
This is all high tech Shit.
Yup.

1466
01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:58.900
Can still hear this microphones that we can get.
There'll be even more more.

1467
01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:02.020
They'll catch me even more.
The atmosphere,
the room in this.

1468
01:25:02.150 --> 01:25:05.110
But I think this is the right,
this is my favorite studio man.
I've ever been.

1469
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:08.890
I love this studio.
Let me too,
I've got to replace this bitch in the new spot.

1470
01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:13.550
I was Tony because Tony guys a little bit off here cause we're renegotiating a

1471
01:25:13.551 --> 01:25:17.650
contract with Fox and that the,
you know the heads of Fox,
the suits,

1472
01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:20.770
they hate the kid in big brown that they love our numbers.

1473
01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:24.270
So you know they were working.
No they hate you and you're paranoid.
You know,

1474
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:28.270
they don't know that well but they listen to it cause like what's going on?

1475
01:25:28.271 --> 01:25:31.300
We're getting all these comments and the me and Brian talking about Dick Jokes

1476
01:25:31.301 --> 01:25:36.170
and chicken and chicken,
right.
Corporate.
And that's not very corporate out.

1477
01:25:36.171 --> 01:25:38.730
We tell him what they tell him.
He goes,

1478
01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:43.440
is there any way you guys can talk less about ticks?
Is there way?

1479
01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:47.590
No.
No.
Probably not.
Probably not.

1480
01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:51.130
We're too young to do that.
I'm 40.
Well here's the thing man,

1481
01:25:51.131 --> 01:25:54.040
once they start asking you,
it's just never going to stop.
No,
no.

1482
01:25:54.041 --> 01:25:56.650
That was the term though.
Cause we came to an agreement and they go,

1483
01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:58.660
we're gonna let you keep doing your thing cause you have great numbers.

1484
01:25:58.870 --> 01:26:01.600
You guys do that and now we're,
now we're going to do,

1485
01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:06.140
we just signed this deal to do a digital shows of Brian and myself.

1486
01:26:06.141 --> 01:26:10.370
Like Robin big.
What's Robin big?
Uh,
but basically like,

1487
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:14.570
um,
how would you describe Robin Big Jamie,
what is it?
It's a,

1488
01:26:14.571 --> 01:26:17.020
it's a reality show,
but like that you,

1489
01:26:17.021 --> 01:26:20.170
you do stupid stuff like Brian and I are going to attempt naked and afraid when

1490
01:26:20.171 --> 01:26:22.580
we go.
Go fucking out in the woods button.
Aka you do this.

1491
01:26:22.581 --> 01:26:23.780
Why didn't you guys talk to me first?

1492
01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:32.420
It's an extension of the podcast is two or three minutes.
Sketchy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1493
01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:36.600
Like sketching naked and afraid for two or three minutes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Brendon,

1494
01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:40.330
how to be an actor.
Your podcast numbers are undeniable.
No they can't,

1495
01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:43.960
but you're getting 50 cents a fucking gas.
All these different people,

1496
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:46.670
you guessed.
It's undeniable.
So once that happens,

1497
01:26:46.671 --> 01:26:48.470
there's really nothing they can do.
They fucked up.

1498
01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:50.590
It's like what happened when the Internet,
they would,

1499
01:26:50.630 --> 01:26:54.140
the government I'm sure would not like everyone have access to all the

1500
01:26:54.141 --> 01:26:57.620
information in the world,
but the door's open.

1501
01:26:57.621 --> 01:27:00.560
There's nothing they could do about it.
Now.
Once it gets open like that,

1502
01:27:00.710 --> 01:27:03.830
that's what it is.
They were there.
Yeah.
They were cool about it.

1503
01:27:03.831 --> 01:27:06.890
They're just like,
hey man,
is there,
what is the kings of Leon?
Is that a band?

1504
01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:10.100
David done shit in a wild though.
Things are rough in Nashville.

1505
01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:14.810
That's if that's the star there.
That's it.
It's all,
it's there.
That's it.

1506
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:18.970
No Big Brown.
None.
The audience and the smiling,
no one's invited.
Big Round fight.

1507
01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.640
Invited the big browns on that house.

1508
01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:26.060
Their latest album has a really good song called wait for me.
Yeah,

1509
01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:29.600
most of the album.
Not that really into,
not my cup of tea from me.

1510
01:27:29.670 --> 01:27:32.810
I'm worried if I shut the UFC event there and put me in the nose bleeds and be

1511
01:27:32.811 --> 01:27:35.480
like,
you got to wear all this Reebok.
Lucky for you.

1512
01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:40.280
You know somebody would tickets.
Oh Vince,
same pru.

1513
01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:43.370
They're not going to do that to you man.
It wouldn't put you in a Lowe's.

1514
01:27:43.371 --> 01:27:47.360
Please listen,
you're an ally and an asset for the UFC.
You're a huge UFC fan.

1515
01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:49.460
It's just huge fan.
But someone like Fox,

1516
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:51.950
they're going to have a problem with what you're doing because it's so

1517
01:27:51.951 --> 01:27:54.170
unconventional.
And if you say something ridiculous,

1518
01:27:54.171 --> 01:27:55.550
they're the ones who are going to get blamed for it.

1519
01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:58.220
Who let these fucking guys get on the Fox network.

1520
01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:01.000
That's also why our numbers are so big.
Cause cause,

1521
01:28:01.050 --> 01:28:04.010
cause I don't sugarcoat things and I realize I'm gonna get in trouble.

1522
01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.500
This is why I told you you guys shouldn't be on anybody's network.

1523
01:28:06.530 --> 01:28:09.410
I know you've always said that you don't want to send a Fox,
don't censor us.

1524
01:28:09.411 --> 01:28:12.620
And they're like,
cool,
keep doing your thing.
As soon as your numbers drop,

1525
01:28:12.650 --> 01:28:15.950
we're gonna kill you and you shouldn't have a contract with anybody.

1526
01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:17.180
There's no need.

1527
01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:21.530
There's no need for anybody to have anything in writing that connects you and

1528
01:28:21.531 --> 01:28:23.240
them to what you guys are doing.
Well,

1529
01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:26.990
you guys are doing is you guys for just no need.
Like it's not,

1530
01:28:26.991 --> 01:28:30.050
you're not gaining anything by being affiliated with someone.
In fact,

1531
01:28:30.051 --> 01:28:32.180
you're losing money.
You're losing money,

1532
01:28:32.181 --> 01:28:35.480
you're losing control and you're losing your mind because you're having to have

1533
01:28:35.481 --> 01:28:37.700
these conversations with.
They tell you not to talk about Dick.

1534
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.970
You shouldn't be connected to anybody.
It should be only you.

1535
01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:45.770
This is 2015 you don't need that Rhonda Commercial.
Another one.

1536
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:49.970
Unstoppable.
She's beyond Bruce Lee's.
Come on.

1537
01:28:49.971 --> 01:28:53.180
Ticketless Bruce Lee never got this big.
Oh,
real quick.
If he didn't die,

1538
01:28:53.181 --> 01:28:57.840
but they wouldn't be doing commercial.
Fuck Bruce Lee about that.

1539
01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:01.380
Sure.
What?
Joe Rogan,
Eddie Bravo.
Brian said he could beat up Bruce Lee.

1540
01:29:01.381 --> 01:29:04.350
I believe I could beat him in a fight.
He's dead.
See I'm being serious.

1541
01:29:04.670 --> 01:29:09.540
Well you weighed 35 pounds and you're at least one 40.
Hey man,
70 bro.

1542
01:29:11.850 --> 01:29:15.990
There's also the possibility that you were some sort of a taekwondo fighter.

1543
01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:19.920
Yeah,
man.
That's why I'm buying a shirt.
So I don't know.

1544
01:29:20.760 --> 01:29:23.190
I don't like the way you just implied that maybe I wasn't.

1545
01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:25.200
By the way you said that,
because he took a sip of wine in a very,

1546
01:29:25.201 --> 01:29:29.270
I'm so glad there's at least one video of me knocking somebody out on line one.

1547
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:29.911
Thank you.

1548
01:29:29.911 --> 01:29:33.510
I'm like something so many fought some something cause otherwise it sounds like

1549
01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:34.613
there weren't,

1550
01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:39.410
<v 1>oh hey mom has them.
She'll,</v>

1551
01:29:39.411 --> 01:29:42.880
she'll send me to say that.
Cause I used to ask him for

1552
01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:46.310
the longest time,
I was like,
Shit.

1553
01:29:47.660 --> 01:29:52.160
But I experienced his turning side of cake,
like firsthand.

1554
01:29:52.500 --> 01:29:53.930
Uh,
we'd be in his garage and he'd be,

1555
01:29:54.140 --> 01:29:58.250
he'd be kip murdering the bathroom and I didn't know if that was normal.

1556
01:29:58.430 --> 01:30:00.960
I'm like,
is that normal?
Normal?

1557
01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:07.370
So this is what happened.
I'd go to,
uh,
back to Jujitsu school.

1558
01:30:07.371 --> 01:30:10.880
And that was one bag.
It was a Jujitsu John Jackman Machado Academy.

1559
01:30:10.881 --> 01:30:14.240
There's one kicking bag that's heavy on the bottom.

1560
01:30:14.241 --> 01:30:17.150
It's not even hanging from the ceiling.
And,
uh,
and,

1561
01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:21.590
and in Jujitsu there's always karate,
black belt,
taekwondo,

1562
01:30:21.591 --> 01:30:23.390
black belt in Jujitsu.
It's very,

1563
01:30:23.391 --> 01:30:27.050
very common that these black belts from the striking discipline's a traditional

1564
01:30:27.051 --> 01:30:30.410
martial arts or are taking Jujitsu.
So I didn't know if he was like,

1565
01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:36.420
it was normal.
So I would have a guy who kicked the bag,
a black belt,
and I,

1566
01:30:36.421 --> 01:30:39.200
and I said,
throw it turning sidekick.
Let me see what it feels like,

1567
01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:40.820
or it looks like.
And then he throw it.

1568
01:30:40.821 --> 01:30:44.510
Then Joe would come and fucking throw it and everybody would just stand back and

1569
01:30:44.511 --> 01:30:49.180
say,
dude,
he's 40 shows tap and 48 years old,
no one in the back.

1570
01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:53.960
No one else kicked the bed at first to be trying to fuck me.
I go,
okay.

1571
01:30:53.961 --> 01:30:58.000
So it's real.
And then I would get,
I would get into that.
I,
I would,
uh,

1572
01:30:58.010 --> 01:31:01.270
there was one time he went to go get his car and talked about this.

1573
01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:08.600
Okay,
well we didn't talk about this March and I grabbed that cards.

1574
01:31:08.601 --> 01:31:11.210
Amazing.
By the way,
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
I that cards amazing.

1575
01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:14.150
Anthony Johnson.
Jim Man.
Ooh.

1576
01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:16.350
<v 2>When asleep son page.</v>

1577
01:31:16.650 --> 01:31:21.060
I said girl verse Alex Chan mean we were seeing with the [inaudible] me and Joe

1578
01:31:21.061 --> 01:31:24.340
and mark they'll go out to and delegate out to is saying that he,
I,

1579
01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:27.770
you may laugh,
but I spent a long time kicking and I spent a long time.

1580
01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:29.790
I'm really good guys who could kick really hard.

1581
01:31:29.970 --> 01:31:33.120
I've never seen anybody kicked the way he does.

1582
01:31:33.570 --> 01:31:36.300
That's where it says 48 years old and marked in the [inaudible].
I said,

1583
01:31:36.301 --> 01:31:40.810
I can't hold pads because my forearms,
I couldn't sign.

1584
01:31:40.811 --> 01:31:42.060
It was trying to sign checks.
He goes,

1585
01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:46.650
my hands were shaking too much after holding fucking pads for you as you were

1586
01:31:46.651 --> 01:31:49.650
kicking him.
I,
when I saw that Instagram personally I,

1587
01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:54.680
I've spent a long time around good kickers and trying to kick really well

1588
01:31:54.691 --> 01:31:57.410
myself.
I've never seen him in a kick like that.
I never said this dudes,

1589
01:31:57.411 --> 01:32:00.280
you kick whiter than me.
We should watch videos of Melvin Manhoef Columbine.

1590
01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:03.070
<v 0>But you're not that far behind,
Bro.
You're really not.</v>

1591
01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:08.490
You're not that far behind all I it anybody that holds pads for him and it's

1592
01:32:09.170 --> 01:32:13.910
crazy.
He's,
everyone says the same thing.
Holy Goddamn shitty.
Yet he's got,

1593
01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:18.970
it's every strike.
It isn't just the turning psyche.
It's every goddamn strike.

1594
01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:22.090
It's just leg stuff.
I just grew up doing it,
man.

1595
01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:26.770
Taekwondo gives you this weird weird,
I it for a long time.

1596
01:32:26.771 --> 01:32:30.990
I don't have that.
Well,
I have a loose like a snap to my hips.
They,
they,
they,

1597
01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:32.320
I don't tighten them up.

1598
01:32:32.350 --> 01:32:37.030
It's all loosened to the end and then in the end you're digging in [inaudible]

1599
01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:41.470
we have the pick shit.
Fucking love me some vehicles,
man.

1600
01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:44.800
I thought it was one podcast where we just went balls deep in these pickles.

1601
01:32:44.801 --> 01:32:46.180
That's those Grillo's pickles though.

1602
01:32:46.181 --> 01:32:49.890
These are like regular fucking store bought.
Pickles are really good.

1603
01:32:50.050 --> 01:32:54.010
They're okay,
but Grillo's this shit.
Okay.
Those are the shit.

1604
01:32:54.250 --> 01:32:58.860
I think if more guys did yoga,
I think yoga would help your cakey yoga.

1605
01:32:58.870 --> 01:33:02.190
Yoga is the shit dude.
And I think stretch,

1606
01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:06.010
stretching and flexibility like Eddie Bravo's guard is like the one of the most

1607
01:33:06.011 --> 01:33:08.110
preposterous guards you can get caught in.

1608
01:33:08.111 --> 01:33:11.530
It's just his leg dexterity is ridiculous.
It's so unusual.

1609
01:33:11.650 --> 01:33:15.250
And a lot of that is because of his flexibility is flexibility.
It's crazy.

1610
01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:17.620
And I see guys,
it's cranes.

1611
01:33:17.621 --> 01:33:21.520
Duty is not an always says stop,
please stop.

1612
01:33:21.521 --> 01:33:22.690
Because you're way more flexible.

1613
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:26.500
You way more flexible in certain ways than me and I'm very flex in illusion.

1614
01:33:26.530 --> 01:33:27.363
No it's not.

1615
01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:32.710
But I've seen people trying to emulate what he does.

1616
01:33:32.711 --> 01:33:34.780
But you don't have the flexibility.
Yeah,
they did can't.

1617
01:33:34.810 --> 01:33:35.650
They don't have the dexterity.

1618
01:33:35.651 --> 01:33:38.350
You don't have flexibility and it makes such a giant difference.

1619
01:33:38.470 --> 01:33:40.300
It's those numbers that you get in.

1620
01:33:40.301 --> 01:33:42.970
It's just those numbers in the idea of what you're trying to do.

1621
01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:46.510
And then there's all the physical shit cause some people are just born with

1622
01:33:46.511 --> 01:33:50.500
different bones.
Yeah,
they just built,
some people are born like Hydra Gracie,

1623
01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:52.180
these long ass fucking arms.

1624
01:33:52.181 --> 01:33:56.470
They can just cinch Darcy's in from anywhere long triangles that can get both of

1625
01:33:56.471 --> 01:33:58.600
your fucking arms trapped in like an a dead orchard.

1626
01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:03.040
They can do things with your body if you have these long bodies that you can't

1627
01:34:03.041 --> 01:34:05.020
do.
But then there's these Paul Horace bodies.

1628
01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:07.960
Plus you've got this goddamn gorilla.
I'm lucky.
Strike that guy.

1629
01:34:07.961 --> 01:34:12.040
I feel like I'm you.
That's what it's like.
I stand next to him.

1630
01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:18.490
<v 1>Dark Guy.
Yeah.</v>

1631
01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:21.260
I have a beautiful expressive Balis feel like a Clod.

1632
01:34:21.261 --> 01:34:25.610
Always feel like an extra y.
I see a big ass fucking arm over there.

1633
01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:31.820
You're looking at that arm?
No,
seriously.
I'm Brian.
You should lift right.

1634
01:34:32.330 --> 01:34:35.960
Here's the body of hermits.
A frog.
Hey Bro.
Hey Bro.

1635
01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:41.370
What are you talking about?
Jeans

1636
01:34:46.230 --> 01:34:51.050
flex for sure.
Show him the guys.
I'm relaxing my shit right now.

1637
01:34:51.051 --> 01:34:54.960
I'm relaxed.
His Shins.
He Kermit the frog.
My legs are way bigger than that.

1638
01:34:54.961 --> 01:34:59.920
So funny
the frog.
So Ronnie,

1639
01:35:04.710 --> 01:35:08.650
what size?
All the way down.
All their Kermit the frog here.

1640
01:35:10.980 --> 01:35:12.690
Good.
Currently fraud.
That's not

1641
01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:18.640
a bad shot too.
That was actually her

1642
01:35:23.310 --> 01:35:24.143
arms.

1643
01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.630
Just like cripes to stream pipe cleaners.

1644
01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:32.660
So silly and funny.

1645
01:35:35.490 --> 01:35:37.820
He's like the perfect reference that is like,

1646
01:35:37.821 --> 01:35:42.090
seriously are you going to make fun of a dude's arm curry curve into frogs are

1647
01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:53.060
currently
take offense.
I'm pissed now.

1648
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.100
Thank you brother.
Thank you man.
Jesus Christ.

1649
01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:01.360
Fucking Instagram posts that you and I both posted you.

1650
01:36:01.361 --> 01:36:04.430
You posted a caption with it.
There's a dude who suck in.

1651
01:36:04.431 --> 01:36:08.990
Then I sent that to my brother Eddie Bravo.

1652
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:11.960
Probably the best captured on his Eddie Brown says,

1653
01:36:11.961 --> 01:36:14.480
when you partied and Rodman has the last rock

1654
01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:24.480
go king.

1655
01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:28.570
The reason why it came up to me it was because the guy has Kermit the frog
buddy.

1656
01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:31.580
We were talking about how this guy's like so meek.

1657
01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:34.940
He's probably like only like three feet tall and he's just like used to being

1658
01:36:34.941 --> 01:36:35.774
humiliated,

1659
01:36:37.010 --> 01:36:41.780
suck their toes and Camp God has aren't women.
Dude.

1660
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:44.570
Come on man,
dude,

1661
01:36:46.330 --> 01:36:51.250
and this dude is just deep throating these toes.
I sent it to you.

1662
01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:55.340
Then I found it that judge Joseph [inaudible].
Everyone did.

1663
01:36:55.341 --> 01:36:58.270
That's probably how Dennis Rodman's feet actually

1664
01:36:59.970 --> 01:37:04.480
bravo on Instagram is not you.
He's now the reality

1665
01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:11.060
following someone named Lindsey Sturge.
I don't know on Instagram,

1666
01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:15.710
I dunno.
There's someone named Lindsey on sex crimes and must be an Eddie Bravo.

1667
01:37:15.711 --> 01:37:20.711
Thank God she took my shit so I had to do that douchey thing by saying the real

1668
01:37:21.730 --> 01:37:26.660
raw as I feel really do.
She won't take your shit.
I thought that I originally,

1669
01:37:26.661 --> 01:37:31.430
I just thought that's what you're supposed to do.
If like
this is

1670
01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:35.240
real fucking fun.

1671
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:42.103
Somebody told me,

1672
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:49.550
somebody told me once that if a girl has a second toe that's bigger than the big

1673
01:37:49.551 --> 01:37:53.360
toe,
that she's undoubtedly free no matter what she tells you.

1674
01:37:53.570 --> 01:37:56.070
She could tell you she goes to church.
The a freak like

1675
01:37:56.970 --> 01:37:59.880
<v 0>girl.
That's not across fight.
Not a girl's foot.</v>

1676
01:37:59.881 --> 01:38:02.490
You right in that it might be a girl split.
I don't think so.

1677
01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:06.210
It might be like so what's that of time possible?
No,
no.

1678
01:38:06.370 --> 01:38:10.860
Gallium Gabrielle Reece who shake go chicken.
Okay,
here we go.
Rebecca Lobos,

1679
01:38:11.340 --> 01:38:13.940
Derek Brunson.
Sam Alvin is a good God damn about Sam.

1680
01:38:14.190 --> 01:38:19.190
Sam Ma Alvey on the ultimate fighter season 14 I was a guest coach on there and

1681
01:38:19.951 --> 01:38:21.210
he drove me fucking nuts.

1682
01:38:21.211 --> 01:38:25.300
I didn't think would make you shit because he quit nonstop all the time.
Quiz.

1683
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:29.710
Yeah.
And they already quit sparring and seems to be going rafting.

1684
01:38:29.730 --> 01:38:32.400
He just stopped and then be like,
oh I'm hurt and would sit out all the time.

1685
01:38:32.401 --> 01:38:36.030
Nervous man.
Oh Shit.
He's a tough fight.

1686
01:38:36.090 --> 01:38:39.060
Brunson has really good kicks,
man.
He uh,

1687
01:38:39.090 --> 01:38:42.450
caught Yoel Romero with a switch kick to the head and that's when I realized

1688
01:38:42.451 --> 01:38:44.130
like,
what a freak you,
oh,
we're marrow is.

1689
01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:48.870
Cause Yoel Romero took it right on the neck and just stunned them for a second

1690
01:38:48.871 --> 01:38:51.900
and then just went right back to his normal.
Have a fight coming up.

1691
01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:54.810
Did he sign anything?
I do not know.
That's a good question.

1692
01:38:55.830 --> 01:38:59.900
I think he's hoping he's wide breaking his threat in many ways.
Eol No,

1693
01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:01.860
I think Rockhold is,
I think it's the greatest fight.

1694
01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:03.360
Middleweight his career out of your mind.
It's,

1695
01:39:03.540 --> 01:39:08.060
well he's not out of his mind for sure.
It's a good fight,
Brian.
No,

1696
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:10.140
you're wrong.
They're both in their prime.

1697
01:39:10.141 --> 01:39:12.720
Could have easily been monsters in the crime.

1698
01:39:12.780 --> 01:39:16.680
You gotta tell me how you watch him go through Leo Machida.

1699
01:39:16.681 --> 01:39:20.280
Like fucking hot butter and you don't want to see Rockhold fight.

1700
01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:24.840
What to guess why I thought I actually thought let me cheat a one that last

1701
01:39:24.841 --> 01:39:28.020
round or at least was awesome.
You got the wrong fight.
You have the wrong fight.

1702
01:39:28.050 --> 01:39:31.610
Fuck you.
Talking called destroy.
Not talking about machinery.

1703
01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:36.600
It either way lost either way.
Lost that.
Well Machida and Weidman,
handsome,

1704
01:39:36.601 --> 01:39:38.430
great exchanges and there was one exchange,

1705
01:39:38.431 --> 01:39:41.660
particularly when Machida poured it on,
but Whiteman,

1706
01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:45.090
why Miss Really fucking durable.
There was no,
his legs never went.
Yes,

1707
01:39:45.091 --> 01:39:48.090
he got tagged with some shots,
but it was never like,
oh my God,
he's gone.

1708
01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:51.930
He's gone out.
It wasn't like he,
he's a beast.
I what I'm trying to say is I,

1709
01:39:52.380 --> 01:39:55.940
I think that y'all Romero is a bigger threat to why man,

1710
01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.490
his cardio is going to be an issue.
Well,

1711
01:39:58.491 --> 01:40:00.060
his cardio is definitely going to be an issue,

1712
01:40:00.061 --> 01:40:02.640
but I don't think he's a bigger threat.
I think he's a huge threat.

1713
01:40:02.820 --> 01:40:04.290
I think they're both huge threats.

1714
01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:09.110
It's like different [inaudible] going off different threats.
Tough.

1715
01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:12.020
He's not.
He's just swinging for the fences.
All these 900 now.

1716
01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:15.870
I'll be better close his mouth though,
but see,
this is one way you should relax.

1717
01:40:15.871 --> 01:40:20.670
Relax.
You got wobbled relaxed,
but he can move better than this.
It guys relaxed.

1718
01:40:20.671 --> 01:40:20.881
Yeah,

1719
01:40:20.881 --> 01:40:25.881
for she was relaxed here and not just fucking teeing off with 100% he's wasting

1720
01:40:25.951 --> 01:40:30.360
energy.
I agree.
If he was more fishing,
more shots for Roche.

1721
01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:33.180
This is what I want to see though.
I want to see guys like this,

1722
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:37.810
but for him as a fighter,
he could do better.
He stopped it.
Stopped.
It stopped.

1723
01:40:37.950 --> 01:40:42.420
That was good.
Yeah.
That's a good stoppage.
I love that for him as I am too,

1724
01:40:42.421 --> 01:40:46.290
but if he just took it down a notch with the wildness and was more accurate

1725
01:40:46.291 --> 01:40:50.220
control or compose more control,
that's expense.
It is experience.
We've all,

1726
01:40:50.221 --> 01:40:52.800
we've all been in that situation where especially if you're angry at somebody

1727
01:40:52.801 --> 01:40:54.100
and you yourself chasing them

1728
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:58.210
<v 2>emotion,
you bring an emotional brushes.
We have enough smart guys like that.</v>

1729
01:40:58.270 --> 01:41:00.580
Let me every now and then can I get like God,

1730
01:41:00.581 --> 01:41:03.420
it's going to go out there or not.

1731
01:41:03.620 --> 01:41:06.210
You're getting that until you get the higher levels.
I want to see that.

1732
01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:08.560
I want to see him develop to the highest skill level possible.

1733
01:41:08.561 --> 01:41:09.291
I think Derrick Brooks,

1734
01:41:09.291 --> 01:41:12.550
it's a bad enough that's hurting guy and like say being controlled and then

1735
01:41:12.551 --> 01:41:13.810
timing it for the exact time.

1736
01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:18.350
We can't have one fucker that goes out there and throws bombs and I'm not

1737
01:41:18.370 --> 01:41:21.940
looking for unique individuals that you know don't reach their potential.

1738
01:41:21.941 --> 01:41:23.980
We're looking for everybody to be as good as they fight.

1739
01:41:23.981 --> 01:41:28.981
Like this should be 50 50 should be trying like it shouldn't go five and ten

1740
01:41:29.110 --> 01:41:30.430
eight years.
Here's a perfect example.

1741
01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:34.330
You want to get Jay check when she had Jessica Pinay hurt in the same type of

1742
01:41:34.331 --> 01:41:39.240
situation.
She didn't do this.
Okay.
Everything.
She did look crisp and controlled.

1743
01:41:39.241 --> 01:41:43.090
How can was way more devastating?
Love fighters was more devastated,

1744
01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:44.260
but they can't all be like,
dad,

1745
01:41:44.261 --> 01:41:48.040
can we have crazy motherfuckers like this every now and then gets a higher level

1746
01:41:48.041 --> 01:41:50.830
where this doesn't work.
Just,
he just needs to get better.
That's all it is.

1747
01:41:50.831 --> 01:41:54.190
He's really good,
really good to take him away from me,

1748
01:41:54.191 --> 01:41:58.390
but it's not even a matter of fact that he can't perform the punches and kicks

1749
01:41:58.391 --> 01:42:00.340
correctly because obviously he can.

1750
01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:02.920
It's just a matter of composure while executing.

1751
01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:05.530
Like I've guaranteed if you got Derek Brunson and you were like,

1752
01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:08.950
if Anthony hard doc was working pads with him and you've got to see him throw

1753
01:42:08.951 --> 01:42:09.950
some combinations,
he would.

1754
01:42:09.951 --> 01:42:14.190
It look smooth as butter instead of while he's just fighting emotionally there.

1755
01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:17.740
I've been there man.
And he broke the dude.
He did it.
I mean he really did do it.

1756
01:42:17.741 --> 01:42:19.090
He broke up and he beat him down.

1757
01:42:19.091 --> 01:42:21.340
You're going to get to a certain level and it happened with me when I thought

1758
01:42:21.341 --> 01:42:21.861
Ben Rothwell,

1759
01:42:21.861 --> 01:42:26.861
I threw a spinning back elbow rocked them and I rushed in like just like he was

1760
01:42:26.921 --> 01:42:31.720
doing and Rotha went,
oh,
cool story.
He hurt through a class,
torque fights over.

1761
01:42:33.130 --> 01:42:37.500
If I had been more controlled,
smart,
calculated.
You want me to start?

1762
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:41.640
Laski did actually with a,
with Travis Brown.
Yeah.
He kind of fight smart.

1763
01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:45.730
He kind of kept waiting,
caught the cop bad,
got caught hard.

1764
01:42:45.890 --> 01:42:48.550
He got her lost keys also,
you know,
he's got a former world champions,

1765
01:42:48.551 --> 01:42:52.010
a lot of experiences.
A lot of guys,
when we get rocked like that,
especially,

1766
01:42:52.050 --> 01:42:54.790
you know you will,
you want to get in and get it.
You're like,
oh,
he's hurt.

1767
01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:57.280
I'm going to jump on them.
Right?
That's one of the guys most dangerous.

1768
01:42:57.281 --> 01:43:01.000
Let's get this.
Carl's Jr is selling a beef burger with no steroids.

1769
01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:06.010
That's what it said.
It said,
no snow.
Carl's Jr sign Ronda Rousey.
Damn.

1770
01:43:06.700 --> 01:43:09.040
Who didn't.
Right?

1771
01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:12.220
Rhonda Rousey is going to be so God damn rich when she retires.

1772
01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:15.880
It's going to be preposterous as she's already pretty rich.

1773
01:43:16.060 --> 01:43:17.140
She's already pretty rich,

1774
01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:19.780
but the amount of Richie's going to be shitting me like Oprah rich.

1775
01:43:20.330 --> 01:43:22.060
She's not a materialistic person at all.

1776
01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:24.520
It doesn't mean what if you guys got back together again?

1777
01:43:25.290 --> 01:43:27.280
It might be a good move for you,
right?

1778
01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:34.860
[inaudible]
I give it.

1779
01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:38.860
I did her a favor,
man.
I'm not the guy for the job.
I'm just not man.

1780
01:43:39.250 --> 01:43:43.420
Not Man enough or woman there.
I'm too much.
I'm too much.

1781
01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:46.900
I'm too Miami.
Yes,
she needs,
she needs the guy who's going to take a back seat.

1782
01:43:46.901 --> 01:43:51.160
That's not me.
She also needs a guy who's gonna say yes ma'am.
Yes ma'am.
Really?

1783
01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:53.840
Well.
She's surrounded by it.
You know,
she's so successful.

1784
01:43:53.841 --> 01:43:57.770
She's surrounded by people that wore spur and go,
yes,
yes,
that's a great idea.

1785
01:43:58.070 --> 01:44:01.550
But when I went,
I don't think that's a good idea.
Now I'm a hater.
No,
no,
no,
no.

1786
01:44:01.610 --> 01:44:05.180
I have.
I have no financial gain from you.
I don't want,

1787
01:44:05.210 --> 01:44:07.730
I don't need anything from him.
I've learned everything myself.

1788
01:44:07.760 --> 01:44:10.760
I don't think we should have this conversation.
I got a respect for her.

1789
01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:14.020
She can't defend herself.
Started me.
You got me on it already.

1790
01:44:16.410 --> 01:44:19.530
Start Trumpster the time you said get back.
Apologize.

1791
01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:23.750
I'll respect to respect to too,
and you know what?

1792
01:44:23.751 --> 01:44:27.380
We've been talking nothing but good shit about his tone.
I think all of us,

1793
01:44:27.650 --> 01:44:30.440
I think that I fucked that.
We've talked about this before.

1794
01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:35.390
You kind of have to be out of your mind to be as good as shoes you have to be.

1795
01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:38.810
You know?
And I think that she would probably admit it as quickly as anybody.

1796
01:44:39.050 --> 01:44:41.390
And I think that in that position that she's in,

1797
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:44.600
when you are that powerful and that strong and this shuts a show,

1798
01:44:44.630 --> 01:44:47.890
such a shining star man,
this,

1799
01:44:48.090 --> 01:44:50.990
the finding a guide to match that with you,

1800
01:44:50.991 --> 01:44:54.440
like finding a guy that you know that you mesh with perfectly,

1801
01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:57.200
it's going to be bullied,
struggle.
That's the balance,
right?

1802
01:44:57.201 --> 01:45:00.080
Like people who are that great to me.
Tough.
And your personal life,
man.

1803
01:45:00.290 --> 01:45:03.350
What do I always say?
I wish I was more bat shit crazy.

1804
01:45:03.351 --> 01:45:06.740
I'd be a way better fighter fucking God.
You know?
Nice.

1805
01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:10.390
If I weren't so nice and friendly and creative,
I'd be a way better fire.

1806
01:45:10.391 --> 01:45:13.430
And then the opposite like Bobby Lee,
you know,

1807
01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:17.410
it's very hard for him to find a woman that can,

1808
01:45:17.650 --> 01:45:21.650
can control him and dominate him correctly.
Who?
Bobby Lee.

1809
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:26.540
Because Lee is the opposite.
Bobby's like this like really small,

1810
01:45:26.541 --> 01:45:29.120
feeble guy who's afraid of everything.

1811
01:45:29.210 --> 01:45:32.060
So he's got to find the right woman for that situation.

1812
01:45:32.490 --> 01:45:35.630
It might be a match for most women.
It doesn't jam up.
You know what I'm saying?

1813
01:45:35.631 --> 01:45:37.700
Yeah.
Yes.
Yeah.
Most women want to be like,
yeah,

1814
01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:39.950
taking care of like throw me against the wall.

1815
01:45:39.951 --> 01:45:44.780
Bobby Lee's I told me against the wall.
You know what I'm saying?
But he's funny.

1816
01:45:44.781 --> 01:45:47.780
So this is funny.
Helps out man.
Try to find

1817
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:53.750
the right person for the job.
That really,
that's really what's up.
You know.

1818
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:57.140
And the funny shit is like Jay Leno and I were having this conversation about it

1819
01:45:57.141 --> 01:46:01.520
named namedrop watch it.
Uh,
we were talking about this guy that showed up.

1820
01:46:01.521 --> 01:46:05.990
It is a studio once and just started asking questions about some actress and

1821
01:46:05.991 --> 01:46:08.690
said,
do you think I could meet her?
Because if I've met her,

1822
01:46:08.691 --> 01:46:12.140
I'm pretty sure that she would know that,
uh,
that I'm the one and he's like,

1823
01:46:12.141 --> 01:46:14.500
Jesus Christ.
Like,
cause you,

1824
01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:19.160
you imagine being a famous woman,
have a bunch of dummies out there.

1825
01:46:19.161 --> 01:46:23.970
The thing they got to you that they could be the one and then they just go,
I go,

1826
01:46:23.980 --> 01:46:25.850
just go to [inaudible] Rhonda.

1827
01:46:25.851 --> 01:46:30.340
She has all these keyboard warriors jacket off to her all the time it got.

1828
01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:33.140
If I could just get in front of her man,
I'm the guy for the job.

1829
01:46:33.141 --> 01:46:36.920
Just smell her ass.
Enjoy that.
Like is just drink or bath water man.

1830
01:46:36.950 --> 01:46:41.270
I would fucking,
oh shit.
Peniel dairy.
Newish.

1831
01:46:41.271 --> 01:46:44.160
Michael Shannon's the bell on the slide down.
Do you want to bet on it?

1832
01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:48.950
I like both.
These guys I would never bet against.
I would never ask you to bet.

1833
01:46:48.951 --> 01:46:51.840
I'm excited about this fight,
but if you pick one,
I'll pick the other.

1834
01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:56.130
I got della Rouche.
Okay.
And he's under Doug [inaudible].
It's not Delaware.

1835
01:47:00.120 --> 01:47:03.270
No,
no fuck up.
Name from time to time.

1836
01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:05.920
Most certainly don't want to bet against Ben Neil dairy,

1837
01:47:05.921 --> 01:47:09.420
which cause I'm a big fan,
but then we're just,
just for the fun of things.

1838
01:47:09.421 --> 01:47:14.250
Favor of just sport and fun or dinner.
You want bet dinner.
Okay,
thanks brother.

1839
01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:16.630
I'm taking the under dog dog.

1840
01:47:18.210 --> 01:47:20.650
I think he's a very skilled fighter.
I liked the way you fight too.

1841
01:47:20.651 --> 01:47:24.440
I also like would Hofeld cord Darrow's done,
man.
I was cornering.
Uh,

1842
01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:27.270
Brian [inaudible] the kid who's tearing up in the UFC right now.

1843
01:47:27.460 --> 01:47:30.560
I was caught him on a low level show in La and dare you,

1844
01:47:30.570 --> 01:47:33.890
she was in the back warming up cause he was the main event and I was watching

1845
01:47:33.891 --> 01:47:36.920
him hit mitts and I was like,
Holy Fuck,
really?

1846
01:47:37.110 --> 01:47:40.980
Who is that guy in TCD was like,
oh that guy's the next big thing.

1847
01:47:41.220 --> 01:47:44.310
So I went and talked to him.
I saw his fight and I'm like,
dude,
what's your deal?

1848
01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:47.580
It's like,
man,
I'm just,
I'm just trying to get better,
blah blah blah.
I'm like,
Oh,

1849
01:47:47.581 --> 01:47:49.590
what's your background?
And he starts telling me like,

1850
01:47:49.650 --> 01:47:52.380
Jujitsu is my passion and he's this worldclass Jujitsu guy.

1851
01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:55.260
But I saw him just wrecked some dude on the feet.
I was like,

1852
01:47:55.261 --> 01:47:58.650
you're good at Jitsu.
He goes,
yeah man,
it's my thing.
I was like,
holy fuck.

1853
01:47:58.651 --> 01:48:00.750
He's very good at you.
Just see his fight with Jim Miller.

1854
01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:03.280
Phenomenally dominate Jim Miller and dominates

1855
01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:06.710
<v 3>ground man
dominates him.</v>

1856
01:48:09.050 --> 01:48:10.100
Crazy shit man.

1857
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:15.530
<v 2>Crazy man.
It's crazy.
Dominate genes.
Crazy ground.
Your fucking pretty good.</v>

1858
01:48:19.850 --> 01:48:22.160
Yeah.
Jim Miller is tough as fuck man.

1859
01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:24.440
They don't get any tougher and he's a black belt in judo.

1860
01:48:24.441 --> 01:48:29.070
He submitted that Brazilian world world champ nearby Armbar.
Yeah,
yesterday.

1861
01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:34.130
Jim Miller is one of the noise.
Yes.
Yeah.
He's a,
he's elite,

1862
01:48:34.230 --> 01:48:35.180
very elite on the ground.

1863
01:48:35.181 --> 01:48:38.810
He also submitted a Charles Olivera and I'm in a leg lock.
He's elite.

1864
01:48:39.140 --> 01:48:41.990
He's one of those guys that are always watched fight and I always appreciate his

1865
01:48:41.991 --> 01:48:44.360
fights is fantastic,
but I'm always like,
man,

1866
01:48:44.361 --> 01:48:47.240
how many more of these it's got to have in them.
It's a bummer,
right?
Yeah.

1867
01:48:47.241 --> 01:48:51.910
Because that style is just so taxing.
Miller was just fucking super aggressive.

1868
01:48:51.911 --> 01:48:54.840
Again,
speaking of that style,
we had a buddy,
I won't mention names,

1869
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:57.950
fight in the UFC and his style was kind of like that Leonard Garcia style,

1870
01:48:58.570 --> 01:49:01.160
and I talked to him on the phone and could not understand them,

1871
01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:05.450
literally cannot understand them and I go,
what are you doing these days,
man?

1872
01:49:05.770 --> 01:49:06.603
I'm just,
I'm just

1873
01:49:08.170 --> 01:49:11.540
to teach in a little box and then I'm working at this school.

1874
01:49:11.690 --> 01:49:13.520
Did you know Shane Mosley's fighting soon?

1875
01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:18.650
Shane Mosley is fighting Ricardo [inaudible].
That's such a bummer.

1876
01:49:18.651 --> 01:49:22.530
Have you ever met Mosley?
Know what?
I've seen him talk hunch drunk.

1877
01:49:22.531 --> 01:49:23.660
So I just punched trunk.

1878
01:49:23.661 --> 01:49:27.530
But how about the fact that his body seems to have deteriorated like he shrank

1879
01:49:27.740 --> 01:49:31.610
his buck is muscle definition has done.
He was on.
Um,
there was,
uh,

1880
01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:35.660
one of those shows that white wine get that fucking shit up with that white
shit.

1881
01:49:35.661 --> 01:49:39.440
Where's the Red Gun?
I'm a man,
Bro.
I'm gonna drink.
I mean,
if it's all we have,

1882
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:43.660
hey,
what's up with the red right there?
Whoa.
Don't put that Angel Piss in here.

1883
01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:48.913
Hey Jill.

1884
01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:58.090
That's hilarious.
That's hilarious.
I'm not red dog.
All right man.

1885
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.740
I'm a fan of this.
Wait,
well does that guy fucking dude,
two men.

1886
01:50:05.741 --> 01:50:09.970
But Neil diary should a smart feed.
Very calculated.
Waking on the ground.

1887
01:50:09.971 --> 01:50:14.200
Man looks at his ground game.
Nasty fucking submissions.
Michael Johnson.

1888
01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:19.090
Michael Johnson has been sparring on a regular basis with Nikki holds skin.

1889
01:50:19.091 --> 01:50:20.950
Nikki holes can retrain it with a black ceiling.
It's,

1890
01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:23.380
there are some great videos that I'm going to war.

1891
01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:25.880
They'd been sparring exclusively down there.
Jesus,

1892
01:50:26.190 --> 01:50:29.470
Nikki holds gives also been working out with his ducks to kickboxing coach.

1893
01:50:29.471 --> 01:50:33.880
The kickboxing coach for a whole skin is showing them combinations that they use

1894
01:50:33.881 --> 01:50:36.190
trouble cause he's getting the faculty to pick it up like that.

1895
01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:39.790
He's picking it up.
His sparring sessions had been fucking legendary down.

1896
01:50:39.791 --> 01:50:42.400
They were the whole skin hope of it.
Well no,

1897
01:50:42.401 --> 01:50:43.410
there's some videos of him getting it.

1898
01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:46.110
There's one of them and get rocked holes can caught him with a left hook

1899
01:50:53.610 --> 01:50:56.500
already.
It might be a good tee shirt.

1900
01:50:58.260 --> 01:51:02.740
That's a great sign.
The kid,
you were the girl with the frog clean flippers.

1901
01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:06.850
I always be as miss piggy.
I always thought that Dutch kickboxing,

1902
01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:08.260
like the Anthony Hardonk style,

1903
01:51:08.290 --> 01:51:11.470
I always thought that was the Dutcher's version of [inaudible] Thai.

1904
01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:15.940
But hanging out with Anthony,
he's telling me he's giving me the history and has,

1905
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:19.620
it's really has nothing to do with them.
Wait Times more karate,
karate base.

1906
01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:21.190
It's karate base.

1907
01:51:21.191 --> 01:51:25.270
But they did incorporate some of the Thai techniques and they definitely did

1908
01:51:25.271 --> 01:51:30.050
incorporate like,
but they,
they use is more like a showed aecon or um,
uh,

1909
01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:33.550
not show to conduct Kojo rule.
You're like one of those hard styles.

1910
01:51:33.670 --> 01:51:36.710
He said the main difference is the footwork and we tie,

1911
01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:41.650
he kind of just plod forward.
There's no footwork in with,
with,
with what they do.

1912
01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:45.850
It's like Mecina there's a lot of footwork and out and you just don't stand

1913
01:51:45.851 --> 01:51:49.480
there and take shots.
Yeah.
They also have this fucking hardstyle man.

1914
01:51:49.481 --> 01:51:54.380
It's a hard style.
There's the Holland style of kickboxing.
They had some,
some,

1915
01:51:54.410 --> 01:51:56.590
some innovations of their own too.
Like you know,

1916
01:51:56.591 --> 01:52:00.190
that combination that everybody calls the Duchy that left hook to the body and

1917
01:52:00.191 --> 01:52:01.600
the right leg kick behind it.

1918
01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:05.320
That's something that's like really classic to more Thai.
But,

1919
01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:08.110
but the Dutch really took it to another level.

1920
01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:13.060
They throw like boxing style combinations that the,
uh,
the,
the,

1921
01:52:13.110 --> 01:52:16.060
the Thai guys didn't.
And then when,
um,
uh,

1922
01:52:16.210 --> 01:52:20.290
Ramon Dekkers went over there and fought the ties,
he is a beast.
Oh my God.

1923
01:52:20.291 --> 01:52:23.650
He was fun to watch monster.
And he fought the ties at their weight.

1924
01:52:23.710 --> 01:52:25.450
It wasn't like Cayman or lot.

1925
01:52:25.470 --> 01:52:29.020
These other guys who were like bigger guys from Holland are huge.
You know,

1926
01:52:29.021 --> 01:52:32.720
the average height of a gynecologist,
six feet tall and a woman.

1927
01:52:35.110 --> 01:52:38.530
The both Overeems or from
Peter Wirtz.

1928
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:43.750
Anthony said he said that a low level boxer can beat a low level Dutch kickboxer

1929
01:52:46.670 --> 01:52:47.300
but uh,

1930
01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:52.300
an elite Dutch kickboxer will always beat an elite boxing cause they will never

1931
01:52:52.371 --> 01:52:54.950
withstand the leg.
Dutch,
he's right

1932
01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:58.790
at the head.
We know how to count.

1933
01:52:58.791 --> 01:53:03.040
But especially especially with boxing gloves on,
especially with boxes.
No,

1934
01:53:03.041 --> 01:53:06.090
I agree.
I just gets way trickier when you have little gloves.
Right.

1935
01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:07.530
That's why you see Joe Schilling got knocked.

1936
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:11.260
The stances difference gloves sneak through for sure.

1937
01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:13.940
Working on take downs.

1938
01:53:13.970 --> 01:53:16.790
We were talking about the difference between boxing and the Dutch style

1939
01:53:16.791 --> 01:53:19.940
kickboxing.
He was,
he really was talking about boxing.

1940
01:53:19.941 --> 01:53:22.310
Like it was primitive.

1941
01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:25.640
Like there's so many things that you do wrong and boxing that when the legs are

1942
01:53:25.650 --> 01:53:26.690
involved,
we'll get,

1943
01:53:27.130 --> 01:53:30.620
and Joe Schilling got knocked out and Gloria meant in Beltour but uh,

1944
01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:35.630
a great kick boxer fighting a guy was a karate guy was a fucking tough karate

1945
01:53:35.631 --> 01:53:38.620
guy though.
This stuff,
dude,
I can't get enough of boxing now.

1946
01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:41.470
I watch every fucking boxing match.
Did you see,

1947
01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:46.130
did you say yes lord.
He's damn,

1948
01:53:46.150 --> 01:53:50.420
he's based man.
He hits so hard.
He's a monster and it's so fucking hot.

1949
01:53:50.421 --> 01:53:54.670
Or You have the time or you're single.
No,
I have a girl there.

1950
01:53:54.671 --> 01:53:56.210
They're huge on Saturday nights though.

1951
01:53:57.570 --> 01:53:59.870
Bitches now time for the fucking,

1952
01:53:59.871 --> 01:54:03.350
you have fee and you're such a UFC x but you know,
every goddamn fight of,

1953
01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:07.810
you know,
record a minute.
Holy Shit.
It's all so much fights twice every week.

1954
01:54:07.811 --> 01:54:08.644
It just depends.

1955
01:54:09.130 --> 01:54:11.720
Most fight to watch important ones you watch twice important ones.
Yeah.

1956
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:16.640
So Kovalev is Kovalev is just such a smooth box.
Sam Fight.

1957
01:54:16.641 --> 01:54:18.880
Andre Ward.
I think that'd be,
that's a phenomenal fight.

1958
01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:23.000
Andre Ward need to do something.
I mean,
he's recovering from shoulder surgery.

1959
01:54:23.001 --> 01:54:25.870
He is,
but he just fought.
He just slapped me versus time.
Yeah,

1960
01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:30.090
they brought him up.
I Dunno.

1961
01:54:31.010 --> 01:54:32.390
I feel like Andre Ward,

1962
01:54:33.690 --> 01:54:36.940
I think he's the best fighter right now is his very soul.
Good man.

1963
01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:39.860
When you do with a cover that that'd be a really white,
such a good fight.

1964
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:44.120
He's black,
but he's a gold medal stand and his dad was white.
His father,

1965
01:54:44.130 --> 01:54:48.140
his mother was black.
He said half a hundred word.
Yeah,
he's so,
he's so good,
man.

1966
01:54:49.070 --> 01:54:53.330
Yeah.
Cool.
Cause an Alpha an owl boxes on ESPN.
NBC.

1967
01:54:53.540 --> 01:54:56.810
It's so dope,
man.
Really?
Yes.
Wow.

1968
01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:59.720
I'd really like to see that fight that,
that'd be ridiculous.

1969
01:54:59.721 --> 01:55:02.090
A lot of really good fights in boxing right now.

1970
01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:05.630
You know the middleweight division,
it's heat can add a Canelo Alvarez,

1971
01:55:05.631 --> 01:55:10.390
Gennady Golovkin and Alvarez is going fight 'em Cody's face.

1972
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:12.040
Cody,
Miguel,
Cotto Thurman.

1973
01:55:12.750 --> 01:55:17.720
God Damn Garcia.
Like a girl right now.

1974
01:55:17.860 --> 01:55:22.330
Bought boxes with a lot of lists.
Like what the fuck?
I love boxing.

1975
01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:26.570
It's fun.
It's fun to watch.
Yeah.
Kickboxing is more fun to me.

1976
01:55:26.930 --> 01:55:30.200
I'm a big fan of lion fight,
man.
I love what I love.
When I fight.

1977
01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:36.000
Where do you see that tie on access,
TV,

real moy time.
Fifth time bomb man.

1978
01:55:36.030 --> 01:55:40.940
Tim time mom to do cheese.
Now she gets into MMA.
It's going to be trouble man.

1979
01:55:40.941 --> 01:55:44.100
With her stand up.
Oh yeah,
our standups now.
She's kind of talked a little

1980
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:48.020
<v 1>shit to Yolanda.
She has.
I'm a festive time basic.</v>

1981
01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:52.120
She said she thought her standup was basic tip time bond.
Yeah.

1982
01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:58.110
She's a cutie too man too.
I saw he admits and blackouts and I was like,

1983
01:55:58.140 --> 01:56:02.320
good Lord.
She's legit.
You know what?

1984
01:56:02.350 --> 01:56:03.450
I'm looking forward to you man.

1985
01:56:03.510 --> 01:56:06.930
I'm looking forward to some of these small two girls getting into MMA.

1986
01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:11.850
Like Jujitsu world champions.
Hira.
Yeah,
Kiera fighting.
He's traveling on.
She is.

1987
01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:16.120
If she got to,
she would be fighting one 15 she got in there.
Oh my God.

1988
01:56:16.650 --> 01:56:20.870
She's like five seven one 15 I think she weighs Kira.
Kira,
Gracie,

1989
01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:23.850
Gracie too.
She had a baby too.
She's 10

1990
01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:30.380
and 10 10 and she will straight Armbar your Dick Bryan strangle,

1991
01:56:33.151 --> 01:56:36.810
hundred percent she will arm,
Barnes,
shuck and faith.
Yeah,
man.
She's,
I mean,

1992
01:56:36.811 --> 01:56:41.050
she's know Bruce Lee,
but fight,
I love cheese.

1993
01:56:41.290 --> 01:56:43.380
Oversleep,
man.
You'd have your hands full.

1994
01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:49.230
Michael Johnson getting done.
Fuck yet is this is a great fighter.
You do.

1995
01:56:49.231 --> 01:56:53.850
We have a bet on the main event.
OSB.
You're,
you're really,
damn,

1996
01:56:53.851 --> 01:56:56.630
I've OSPI too,
but I'll bet I'll bet off.
Taste.
No Way.

1997
01:56:56.720 --> 01:56:59.430
I'll take lower just for the bet.
How much,
what do you want?

1998
01:57:02.380 --> 01:57:06.090
Something to Glover's a tough fight for hell.
Yeah,
it's a tough fight.

1999
01:57:06.290 --> 01:57:09.390
They think it's,
but if the glow over before he fought Jon Jones,

2000
01:57:09.570 --> 01:57:13.130
do you think Glover has had too many tough fights?
There's tough.
It'll date.

2001
01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:17.910
Find my boy.
Not just hasn't been training,
right.
He's doing something wrong.

2002
01:57:18.330 --> 01:57:21.870
Eddie.
Eddie can't really bet on this because Osp is his boy.

2003
01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:26.580
So this is one of those the favorite.
Yeah,
but Eddie,
Eddie camp,
he can't,

2004
01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:31.590
you know,
she's so hot here,
but even if he wasn't

2005
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:38.100
he,
he's very good at the twister and he's a,
well,

2006
01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:40.830
he's not going to twist her 10th planet clover.

2007
01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:43.620
He's not going to tech twist twister,
glow over.
That ain't happening.

2008
01:57:45.930 --> 01:57:48.000
Trust me.
This

2009
01:57:49.930 --> 01:57:54.740
is phenomenal.
Athlete,
man.
He's,
that's great.
Yeah.
Okay,

2010
01:57:54.741 --> 01:57:58.320
here we go,
and he is,
Jujitsu is very dangerous.
Let's bet on it then.

2011
01:57:59.170 --> 01:58:03.410
Oh my God,
you guys are getting 500 500 deal too.

2012
01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:08.040
I love it cause you find the last band.
They covered it.

2013
01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:08.970
Even honey,

2014
01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:19.290
that's the best way.
Just keep doing it back and forth and just keep a tab on.

2015
01:58:19.291 --> 01:58:22.350
We got get paid.
We'll keep a tab going

2016
01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:27.270
dark.
It gets dark and we have to have a meeting and shame

2017
01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:30.233
me man.

2018
01:58:33.690 --> 01:58:36.840
It's 30,000 with just gimme five right now and shut the fuck up.

2019
01:58:42.430 --> 01:58:43.630
Instead of me giving you five,

2020
01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:46.840
I'll bet you five on the next [inaudible] when we call it.
If

2021
01:58:48.650 --> 01:58:51.580
you lose and fuck you lose a thumb

2022
01:58:55.670 --> 01:58:59.010
back room back there.
I'll bet you a thumb.
Michael Johnson,
here we go.

2023
01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:02.410
Now let me ask you,
this wears dirty was from were originally.
Do we know?

2024
01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:03.910
I used to know,

2025
01:59:03.911 --> 01:59:07.090
I can't remember right somewhere and like or by genre or something.

2026
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:13.420
Her book sex.
It's from the steps somewhere.
This is the best fight on the car,

2027
01:59:13.970 --> 01:59:18.760
I think would be good to get rebounds on girl.
Now she's a dear.
Lovely.

2028
01:59:19.640 --> 01:59:23.490
I want to kick her out of bed for crackers.
Which one?
That ring card girl.

2029
01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:27.730
Her name Christine is kindness.
This guy reminds me of that.
Very nice ladies.

2030
01:59:27.731 --> 01:59:31.420
[inaudible] garden was Sassy kind of thing.
He's Kinda,
he's Kinda relaxed.

2031
01:59:31.421 --> 01:59:36.040
So what happened with dairy?
You Shit,
I need to watch that fight with SLAs.

2032
01:59:36.130 --> 01:59:39.370
Loss,
right?
In Ramsey.
Yeah,
me too.
I had no idea.

2033
01:59:40.090 --> 01:59:42.310
But that's just shows too.
Anybody can get caught.

2034
01:59:42.580 --> 01:59:46.000
Anybody can get caught in any given time.
You Zig when you should've zagged.

2035
01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:49.630
He has competence now though.
You know he's ripped off a couple big wins.

2036
01:59:49.660 --> 01:59:51.040
So as Michael Johnson confidence,

2037
01:59:51.041 --> 01:59:54.370
fuck dude does a good job of keeping his chin tucked.

2038
01:59:54.860 --> 01:59:57.880
He doesn't keep his hands up high,
but he keeps his chin tucking pretty good.

2039
01:59:58.870 --> 02:00:02.350
See how it is from our end.
Thank you Jamie.
Powerful young Jamie.

2040
02:00:02.590 --> 02:00:04.240
But she always keeping his chin tucked here.

2041
02:00:04.270 --> 02:00:09.070
But I bet you he is a Syrian from uh,
from Iran.
Why do I know that?

2042
02:00:09.071 --> 02:00:09.881
Did you know that?
You know,

2043
02:00:09.881 --> 02:00:14.830
I know that she made because he's a Christian and so if he's a Christian in

2044
02:00:14.831 --> 02:00:18.640
Iran,
he's probably an Assyrian,
powerful knowledge of the world.

2045
02:00:18.641 --> 02:00:20.950
Brian won't drop some World Shit on,
you know,
man,

2046
02:00:21.540 --> 02:00:24.000
I don't want to have it when I guessed all their nationalities.
That's it.

2047
02:00:24.010 --> 02:00:26.380
That was amazing.
Main a coffee shop.
No one spoke English.

2048
02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:30.190
You start saying you're from Afghanistan,
you're from Belarus,

2049
02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:31.570
you're from Croatia.
And I was like,

2050
02:00:31.571 --> 02:00:33.730
this was on drugs and all the girls started clapping.

2051
02:00:33.770 --> 02:00:36.350
And I go in here from Turkey through to see that HQ group.

2052
02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:40.780
I ran the fuck's wrong with you.
Come on brother.
You know I got the guns.
I got no

2053
02:00:42.490 --> 02:00:45.410
knowledge.
I'm fucking getting pumped right now.

2054
02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:52.740
Last time we'd rather,
I'm still hiring.
Nope.
Okay.

2055
02:00:52.741 --> 02:00:56.020
Right here.
I'm good.
That was very,
I went to a different planet.

2056
02:00:56.050 --> 02:00:58.510
That was a great answer.
I'm not,
I'm not a seasoned leader.

2057
02:00:58.570 --> 02:01:03.340
You see that Hbo special about Iran where uh,
you can die if you're gay,

2058
02:01:03.341 --> 02:01:06.340
but if you have a sex change to let you live.
Yes.
I didn't see that.

2059
02:01:07.370 --> 02:01:10.930
So all these,
all these gators,
you're supposed to take advantage of science.

2060
02:01:10.931 --> 02:01:13.650
Science has never been something that was,

2061
02:01:13.690 --> 02:01:16.570
I had a problem with you going to take advantage of.
Yeah,
but what did you say?

2062
02:01:16.571 --> 02:01:19.460
They're trying to kill you if you're gay.
Oh,
that sounds very science

2063
02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:25.350
behind that.
By the,
by the way,
there's a bunch of transvestites.

2064
02:01:25.351 --> 02:01:27.190
I just wished there were like,
dude,

2065
02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:31.270
it's a shitload of Caitlyn Jenner.

2066
02:01:32.580 --> 02:01:37.260
Like they're not pretty.
It was either that or die.
No,
it's it actually though.

2067
02:01:37.261 --> 02:01:39.980
Or Jay leaves or not believe it or not,
they

2068
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:40.700
<v 2>say that,</v>

2069
02:01:40.700 --> 02:01:45.410
but there are gay communities in Iran and places and like anywhere else,

2070
02:01:45.411 --> 02:01:47.480
they're kind of left alone.
What's going on here?

2071
02:01:47.490 --> 02:01:51.560
There's a commercial that's going on while the show fight is going on for a

2072
02:01:51.561 --> 02:01:54.380
movie.
They just showed a commercial in the corner movie,

2073
02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:58.250
like full videos and shit.
You know how much they had to pay for that shit.

2074
02:01:58.550 --> 02:02:02.720
I don't,
I've never done crazy VIP treatment.
I am not.

2075
02:02:02.721 --> 02:02:05.540
I'm not understanding of that.
Yeah.
I'm not appreciating that.

2076
02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:08.110
Especially these two.
This is not just fighters.

2077
02:02:08.230 --> 02:02:12.500
It's not just words like Monday night football,
mark it on the bottom,

2078
02:02:13.130 --> 02:02:17.680
which is just show naked chicks.
Just going to distract too.

2079
02:02:17.690 --> 02:02:20.240
What if the renewals by Reebok

2080
02:02:22.820 --> 02:02:26.900
whole,
yeah,
just a girl naked,

2081
02:02:26.901 --> 02:02:29.400
throwing a monster energy drink down or positive.

2082
02:02:31.470 --> 02:02:34.370
Oh Jesus.
This chasm.
No joke.

2083
02:02:34.770 --> 02:02:38.090
He you're running your parents a little bill Hicks.
Bit about that.

2084
02:02:38.091 --> 02:02:40.370
Bill Hicks got a great joke about advertisers.

2085
02:02:40.371 --> 02:02:41.540
If they could do what they wanted to do,

2086
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:45.770
you just see a girl and you'd focus on her and he would go down to her pussy

2087
02:02:45.771 --> 02:02:48.830
lips.
You'd see she's spreading her fingers,

2088
02:02:49.100 --> 02:02:53.150
spreading her pussy and looking you in the eye and it just says drink coke

2089
02:02:54.650 --> 02:02:59.210
or drink coke.
Yeah,
snickers.
That great bit.

2090
02:02:59.211 --> 02:03:02.060
It's so true.
If they get do it,
that would totally work.

2091
02:03:02.170 --> 02:03:04.120
Maybe we turned a lot of women off from coke.

2092
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:06.230
Think if you could do whatever you want,

2093
02:03:06.231 --> 02:03:08.640
there's no fricking repercussions called prince assigned.

2094
02:03:08.670 --> 02:03:11.090
You're doing right now on the Internet son.
This is true.

2095
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:15.300
That's why Fox is panicking that can't control big brown.
He said

2096
02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:18.030
nobody can get into it.

2097
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:23.140
They might pull some JFK shit and the UFC might just snap me out.
Listen,
my,

2098
02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:26.630
they're not straight left.

2099
02:03:26.631 --> 02:03:30.500
Beautiful timing by Johnson.
Damn.
I missed it.
That was pretty,

2100
02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:31.730
oh man.

2101
02:03:31.731 --> 02:03:36.731
He's teeing them up to my mom since today's been spiraling.

2102
02:03:37.810 --> 02:03:38.643
Hold skin.

2103
02:03:41.090 --> 02:03:43.030
He's a fucking animal now.

2104
02:03:43.070 --> 02:03:45.850
Darrio field probably sales like there's something going on.

2105
02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:49.580
It's like he's hitting the dice.
Told toe,
caught him,
caught him with a nice them.

2106
02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:53.720
Try to tell.
Sure.
Mix up the takedowns though.
Huh?
There'll be so flat footed,

2107
02:03:53.721 --> 02:03:57.000
right?
Yeah,
but he thinks she just wants to stand with them.
Ooh.
Yikes.

2108
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.351
Excuse he's,

2109
02:03:57.351 --> 02:04:01.280
I think he's so fucking confident in standup from spar with Holt skin.

2110
02:04:01.580 --> 02:04:05.570
Look at this man.
I think as a,
as good an athlete as he is,

2111
02:04:05.571 --> 02:04:07.910
he's picking it up at a very high rate.
I agree.

2112
02:04:07.911 --> 02:04:11.390
He's got really good training down there in Florida,
Henry,

2113
02:04:11.391 --> 02:04:15.200
who have just so fucking clever as a kickboxing coach.
Where's he down?

2114
02:04:15.230 --> 02:04:20.150
Tonsil black.
We'll kick.
I'm sure he will.

2115
02:04:20.151 --> 02:04:23.510
We might see bowser.
Holy Shit.
Right?

2116
02:04:23.690 --> 02:04:26.960
Instant Barboza holy goddamn chefs we owned all.
That's great.

2117
02:04:26.961 --> 02:04:29.810
But you know what's the scariest thing?
His switch kick is so,
so fast.

2118
02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:34.910
Remember how fast
it was?
Good.

2119
02:04:34.911 --> 02:04:39.900
Yeah,
totally.
Filters filter is really good.
Serious.

2120
02:04:39.901 --> 02:04:41.610
We'll kick serious karate.

2121
02:04:41.611 --> 02:04:46.320
Traditional martial arts telling us with death behind it.
Super complicated.

2122
02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:50.700
He's tough as shit.
When when he does switch kick and he caught him in the ribs,

2123
02:04:51.030 --> 02:04:55.980
his his side was a lobster red.
I mean it was so,

2124
02:04:56.070 --> 02:04:59.340
it was the duck.
A hematoma almost didn't,
didn't miss a beat.

2125
02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:00.600
He was protecting it a little bit,

2126
02:05:00.601 --> 02:05:03.990
but it took a lot of shots of the legs that cut down his movement and see,

2127
02:05:04.010 --> 02:05:07.140
especially in the third row melting off who's very labored in his movement

2128
02:05:07.141 --> 02:05:11.160
because of those kicks.
It slowed.
It slowed him down,
but he is tough as fuck.

2129
02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:15.810
It's in Barboza.
Holy fucking shit.

2130
02:05:16.150 --> 02:05:20.280
That guy muscles on home.
He might be the best kicker in the UFC.

2131
02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:22.410
He's scared.
Might be the best character.

2132
02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:26.310
Last guy you want to [inaudible] guys with leg kicks.

2133
02:05:26.610 --> 02:05:28.680
He stuck two different guys.
Anthony,

2134
02:05:28.681 --> 02:05:32.400
hard Dong said Pedis is up there.
Panacea,

2135
02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:37.200
but it's a scarier Donald's.
Ronnie has the best case.

2136
02:05:37.201 --> 02:05:38.570
He thinks hard to answer.

2137
02:05:38.580 --> 02:05:42.000
That motherfucker tend to top out of mother fucking for sure.
Dossiers.

2138
02:05:42.040 --> 02:05:46.320
Donald's his game as anybody that's ever lived.
He's amazing game is anybody.

2139
02:05:46.890 --> 02:05:49.080
He's so much fun to hang around with too.
I love that guy.

2140
02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:51.153
<v 3>I love him.</v>

2141
02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:54.330
<v 2>Two,
this is a good fight,
but Daria,</v>

2142
02:05:54.340 --> 02:05:56.290
she's got to figure out how to get this fucking fight to the ground.

2143
02:05:56.320 --> 02:05:58.450
It's hard because right now,
oh,

2144
02:05:58.451 --> 02:06:03.290
look at this dairy who she's coming after him now though.
Pressing Daria.

2145
02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:04.330
She's not stupid.

2146
02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:09.010
It's just that I feel like the level of sparring that Johnson's been getting

2147
02:06:09.011 --> 02:06:12.130
such a high level,
it's gonna be hard to take that dude.
Damn man.

2148
02:06:12.670 --> 02:06:16.330
You're going to take him.
It's going to be impossible.
Yeah,
he's so quick.

2149
02:06:16.331 --> 02:06:19.360
It sprawl so good.
I mean he rested in college,
right?

2150
02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:22.270
You know there's good wrestler too.

2151
02:06:24.580 --> 02:06:27.160
When he first started fighting in the UFC and the ultimate fighter showed a lot

2152
02:06:27.161 --> 02:06:29.920
of wrestling talents.
This is bigger than him.
He looks bigger,

2153
02:06:29.921 --> 02:06:33.970
but it doesn't seem to,
he's a long guy,
you know,
but Johnson's thick.

2154
02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:36.850
Oh damn diary.
She's no joke.
These guys.

2155
02:06:36.851 --> 02:06:41.310
Johnson has like a nice snap to his punches.
He does.
Like,
he's like,
he's,

2156
02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:44.670
he's popping in at the end.
No speed man.
But,

2157
02:06:44.740 --> 02:06:47.380
and this is the second round is when you start to see these guys slowed down

2158
02:06:47.381 --> 02:06:51.850
quite a bit.
You know,
it's a moral good footwork,
Jonathan.

2159
02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:52.693
Fuck yeah.

2160
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:58.030
Looking at like Tj Dillashaw except these not switching to oh,

2161
02:06:58.251 --> 02:07:01.760
but don't use tried for the fucking neither do nobody looks as good as Tj right

2162
02:07:01.761 --> 02:07:05.210
now.
God Damn Tj look good.
And that human looks so good.

2163
02:07:05.211 --> 02:07:09.890
Him and Dominic next or what?
Uh,
it depends on where Dominic is that health wise,

2164
02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:14.780
you know,
that's the money.
That's the fight.
But he obviously doesn't want to,

2165
02:07:14.810 --> 02:07:18.650
um,
to come back too soon.
I mean,
he's already done that a couple of times.

2166
02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:22.370
Blown himself out,
fucked his knees up.
And it's just the whole thing.

2167
02:07:22.371 --> 02:07:27.200
It's just such a disaster.
I think Tj even said he'd go up to 45 and fight Conor.

2168
02:07:27.290 --> 02:07:29.720
Yes,
he did.
Yeah.
But the phenomenal

2169
02:07:32.150 --> 02:07:36.010
team,
that would be [inaudible].
That's what he wants.
If Dominic

2170
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:39.500
<v 0>can't go,
he wants to Connor.
Oh Shit.
Wow.</v>

2171
02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:43.960
Don't be crazy to t John Connor though.

2172
02:07:44.020 --> 02:07:48.810
He's a lot smaller little dude.
But you know what is luck?
Good luck kid.

2173
02:07:48.811 --> 02:07:51.580
And Him and his Jujitsu.
Jujitsu is very good.

2174
02:07:51.730 --> 02:07:54.250
I remember back in the day when he was first coming up,
Tj,
I'm like,

2175
02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:58.390
that little wrestler has,
he understands that you get to right away.
He's,
he's,

2176
02:07:58.630 --> 02:08:01.840
he's young in this game and a lot of wrestlers that takes them years to figure

2177
02:08:01.841 --> 02:08:03.550
out.
You got to fall in love with the kids too.

2178
02:08:03.860 --> 02:08:07.000
That's such a high stakes gamble though to fight or garlic Connor because Connor

2179
02:08:07.001 --> 02:08:10.690
could knock them out like Connor's and shots and Connor's not slow,

2180
02:08:11.500 --> 02:08:13.390
not slow with his hands.
You know.

2181
02:08:13.391 --> 02:08:18.391
So like when TJ fought Barao Barao the first fight,

2182
02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:21.070
he got caught off guard and Tj cracked him.

2183
02:08:21.071 --> 02:08:24.430
Nobody expected Tj to be as good as he was.
And after that first round,

2184
02:08:24.431 --> 02:08:27.400
that dude was on autopilot and Tj just beat the brakes off of him like a

2185
02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:28.780
punching bag.
Just beat his ass.

2186
02:08:28.930 --> 02:08:32.350
But the second fight you could see Barao was not the same human being.

2187
02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:37.380
He's not the same human being.
He just,
he's not shell shocked.

2188
02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:42.310
It could have been extreme loss of confidence is you also have to deal with post

2189
02:08:42.311 --> 02:08:46.810
concussion syndrome because that first fight,
he took a fucking beat down.

2190
02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:51.100
He took a beating from the first round to the fifth round and especially that

2191
02:08:51.101 --> 02:08:55.420
last combination when Ti,
when Tj head kicked him,
come on son.
You're that.

2192
02:08:55.550 --> 02:08:59.080
That's terrifying.
Terrifying Shit.
No,
you're right.
So you've got that.

2193
02:08:59.110 --> 02:09:00.310
You've got the recovery of that.

2194
02:09:00.311 --> 02:09:03.280
We all know someone who's had a fight like that and never really totally

2195
02:09:03.281 --> 02:09:04.090
recovered.

2196
02:09:04.090 --> 02:09:07.930
So you got that and then you got confidence loss because he was this monster who

2197
02:09:07.931 --> 02:09:11.200
hadn't been beaten in nine years and just was running through.

2198
02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:14.740
People find a way to feed everybody.
Does it take to get over?

2199
02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:18.460
Like your last fight,
you retired,
you got beat down,
you got your title taken,

2200
02:09:18.461 --> 02:09:20.920
you never come back.
You're obviously,

2201
02:09:20.921 --> 02:09:23.110
you're going to be sad from that like like the next day,

2202
02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:24.880
two days later and a week later.

2203
02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:30.040
When does it get to a point where that fight doesn't matter the fact that you're

2204
02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:35.080
a boxing icon or MMA legend,
you're beyond that last fight.

2205
02:09:35.140 --> 02:09:38.990
Like how long does that take you asking the wrong guy cause cause I'm not,

2206
02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:41.680
I'm not a legend.
You know some guys look,

2207
02:09:41.681 --> 02:09:45.430
no guys ever gone from the ultimate fighter and become as good as Tj did as

2208
02:09:45.431 --> 02:09:46.330
quick as Tj did.

2209
02:09:46.690 --> 02:09:50.800
Tj is like a real freak and he's also a sponge and he's like,

2210
02:09:51.010 --> 02:09:55.120
he's a super nice guy with,
even though Tj is like ultra competitive,
right?

2211
02:09:55.150 --> 02:09:59.530
Obviously he's wicked competitive.
He's,
he doesn't have a big ego.
It's weird.

2212
02:09:59.770 --> 02:10:02.920
He's like super hard,
hard.
He works hard.
He doesn't have any,

2213
02:10:02.950 --> 02:10:04.390
he doesn't have any road bumps.

2214
02:10:04.391 --> 02:10:07.810
You know what personality road bumps in some fighters in hand to keep them from

2215
02:10:07.811 --> 02:10:10.290
learning.
What's a Bummer Joe?
What is the,

2216
02:10:10.330 --> 02:10:15.130
the the kind of the almost want to say the trash truck between Alpha male and

2217
02:10:15.131 --> 02:10:19.780
Dwayne.
Now Mike Chapman has goes,
we fucking made Duane Ludwig.
It's true.

2218
02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:22.660
It's true.
No,
they didn't know.
Listen,
they did.

2219
02:10:22.780 --> 02:10:27.070
He needed the disciples and he found super athletes that were willing to listen

2220
02:10:27.220 --> 02:10:29.140
and it showed what he's capable of,

2221
02:10:29.260 --> 02:10:31.960
but also what made him is how good he is at it.

2222
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:36.410
He's one of the best striking coaches I've ever seen for sure and his

2223
02:10:36.411 --> 02:10:39.950
relationship with Tj and the progress to Tj is made cement that you,

2224
02:10:39.951 --> 02:10:43.850
but you also consider Hockfield Cordaro.
You consider a Duke Roufus.

2225
02:10:43.970 --> 02:10:47.000
You could sit there for us as a hobby.
You consider Mike Winkeljohn.

2226
02:10:47.150 --> 02:10:50.480
There's a lot of really good striking coaches.
It's really,

2227
02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:53.490
a lot of it is dependent upon their students.
Don't think you can say the name,

2228
02:10:53.650 --> 02:10:58.490
but,
but Dwayne found a great stable of studs.

2229
02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:03.590
That's like every athlete or every trainer's Drey.
It's a collaborative marriage.

2230
02:11:03.591 --> 02:11:08.000
It's a symbiotic relationship
taking.

2231
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:10.310
Nobody should be taking credit for anybody,

2232
02:11:10.311 --> 02:11:15.200
I think necessarily of team Alpha male.
I'll see.
Dwayne and I are very close.

2233
02:11:15.230 --> 02:11:16.640
I'm trying to solve this.
I'm like,
come on.

2234
02:11:16.641 --> 02:11:19.700
I'm very close with both of those guys.
I'm very close with Tj.

2235
02:11:19.701 --> 02:11:23.200
I'm very close with Danny.
I love Chad Mendez.
I love your writing too.

2236
02:11:23.201 --> 02:11:26.060
I love all of that.
Dwayne too and I,
you know on it,

2237
02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:29.060
this is like not really talked about very much.
We,

2238
02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:31.640
we had one point in time thought about buying their gym,

2239
02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:35.150
thought about setting up and on it,
Jim through them and we,

2240
02:11:35.151 --> 02:11:38.330
we had considered doing it but we knew that they were having some disputes with

2241
02:11:38.331 --> 02:11:42.170
Dwayne and they were trying to sort it out but we were talking about going into

2242
02:11:42.171 --> 02:11:44.930
some sort of an a on it partnership with them because we sponsor a lot of those

2243
02:11:44.931 --> 02:11:49.730
guys now cam and even language.
You want to start making some more on it.

2244
02:11:49.731 --> 02:11:53.280
Jim's and having an audit.
Mma Gym was an idea that we bounced.

2245
02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:58.190
We bounced around a few times and I think that when you have a stable full guys

2246
02:11:58.191 --> 02:12:01.400
like Chad Mendez,
Lance Palmer,
Tj Dillashaw,

2247
02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:06.410
[inaudible],
Ryan motherfucking Faber,
I mean Jesus,

2248
02:12:06.411 --> 02:12:09.680
God damn on stairs,
these guys are savages.

2249
02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:14.000
And if you get a guy who's as nuts as Duane is,
Dwayne is fucking nuts.

2250
02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:17.810
What about training and about like the fanatical approach that he takes to

2251
02:12:17.811 --> 02:12:21.590
training guys?
He's obsessed.
He's like a true mad scientist.

2252
02:12:21.591 --> 02:12:25.360
I mean hate the day TJ fought Barao.
He and I had lunch and he's,
I,

2253
02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:28.050
there was like five or six other people,
they were all laughing,
joking around,

2254
02:12:28.070 --> 02:12:30.410
can't wait for the fight today.
And Dwayne is sitting there,
it's like,

2255
02:12:30.411 --> 02:12:32.450
what are you gonna do?
Is gonna pick the left and the whole deal about,

2256
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:34.760
well you see broad does these flat foot flat through,

2257
02:12:34.761 --> 02:12:36.590
the guy's never going to be gone.
Like TJ.
He goes,

2258
02:12:36.591 --> 02:12:39.500
cause you just going to set up these angles and like he went out and did exactly

2259
02:12:39.501 --> 02:12:40.400
what Duane said he was gonna do.

2260
02:12:40.401 --> 02:12:44.730
But Duane had this maniacal fanatical thing he say is like,
it's like,
uh,
uh,

2261
02:12:44.750 --> 02:12:49.010
Tj says tapestry.
He's like,
I don't think Tj,

2262
02:12:49.070 --> 02:12:50.620
I don't think those guys would be where the APP,

2263
02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:53.600
Dwayne exact Duane wouldn't be where he's at without them.

2264
02:12:53.630 --> 02:12:56.210
But Danny like Danny Castillo has gotten a lot better.

2265
02:12:56.211 --> 02:12:57.650
You see Danny Castillo in his last fight.

2266
02:12:57.651 --> 02:13:01.850
He's thrown all these head kicks his foot or it looks amazing and he's learning

2267
02:13:01.851 --> 02:13:05.540
from t Janie's learned from Dwayne to it's like well cause he's in Denver with

2268
02:13:05.541 --> 02:13:09.260
yes,
exactly.
But that's the point is that like it was just too bad.

2269
02:13:09.261 --> 02:13:13.070
Those guys couldn't work it out because that is like literally the dream

2270
02:13:13.071 --> 02:13:17.200
relationship.
But they need a mediary even Kamins out now Martin,
Kevin leaving.

2271
02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:19.250
But you might just be tired of training.
No,
he no,

2272
02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:21.630
he said his family doesn't want to be in tech man.
Him.

2273
02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:24.710
That's what he said in the interview.
So now they're looking for other coaches.

2274
02:13:24.711 --> 02:13:27.710
They ask,
I think Kenny Florian he get for and considered it apparently.

2275
02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:28.321
But he considered,

2276
02:13:28.321 --> 02:13:30.950
but I don't think you can do it because all his obligations here,

2277
02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:32.070
media and stuff like that.

2278
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:34.220
<v 2>But can you,
it'd be great.
It would be great.</v>

2279
02:13:34.230 --> 02:13:36.260
He's a phenomenal coach and salary smart.

2280
02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:39.990
Very smart guys are actually taking shots to the head and there they don't seem

2281
02:13:39.991 --> 02:13:42.310
to be faced all.
I don't know what's going on.
It's nice.

2282
02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:44.940
We watched fight and you watched it did take a lot of Tylenol.
Dude.

2283
02:13:45.030 --> 02:13:49.660
That's the deal.
Yeah.
Martin Katherine was the head coach,
had MMA.
He replaced,

2284
02:13:50.580 --> 02:13:54.450
he ran,
he's going,
he's leaving out to campaigns are really tech.
Ooh,

2285
02:13:54.480 --> 02:13:55.313
nice uppercut.

2286
02:13:55.770 --> 02:14:00.480
Michael Johnson has been hit four times and he just keeps coming forward.

2287
02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:03.660
It was a great fight.
I guess we'll have to go over watching it.
We're on it.

2288
02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:05.910
We're not talking shit.
Right.
It's a good fight.

2289
02:14:05.940 --> 02:14:07.680
That's a problem with these God damn fucking paintings.

2290
02:14:07.681 --> 02:14:11.280
We miss amazing fights because the company's too good.
That's a fun.
Now,

2291
02:14:11.670 --> 02:14:13.650
by the way,
right during this right now is winning this round.

2292
02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:17.510
He's tagged him five times.
He's tagged Michael Johnson five times.

2293
02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:21.780
I pay the only round though.
Yeah,
well.
Oh goodness.
He keeps hitting him,

2294
02:14:22.770 --> 02:14:25.710
but it's really not fairly.
[inaudible] Johnson is slowed down at Johnson.

2295
02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:27.740
Slow down and I get a chance.
You know,

2296
02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:32.100
who knows how hard a time he has making one 55 a lot of these dudes have a hard

2297
02:14:32.101 --> 02:14:33.700
time making that wait,
man.
Yeah.

2298
02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:37.590
You see Diego Sanchez dropped to 45 crazy.

2299
02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:41.670
How crazy is okay flight in Ricardo Lamas,
right?
So Mexico.

2300
02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:44.790
So crazy.
Phenomenal fight and no,
let me ask you this.

2301
02:14:44.791 --> 02:14:49.100
What do you think about Rockhold dropping down to one 85 now with the lack of
IV.

2302
02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:52.710
So they take away your ivy when that starts in October,
right?
Right.

2303
02:14:52.711 --> 02:14:57.310
What are they fighting?
Why did I think they were fighting after that?

2304
02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:03.360
I thought they were fighting in September.
Am I wrong?
You might be right.
No.
Oh,

2305
02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:08.070
oh,
beautiful.
Left hand.
Where is it in September?
Where's it taking place?

2306
02:15:08.430 --> 02:15:10.350
You're right,
because you're right,

2307
02:15:10.351 --> 02:15:14.570
because in g Jamille find out for us either way,
but either way.

2308
02:15:14.770 --> 02:15:17.970
Rockhold the fucking dare you show the huge 80 fiber.

2309
02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:22.290
He's big and those Ivs,
I mean they got to have a man,
but do they,

2310
02:15:22.291 --> 02:15:25.650
because Joe Silva was trying to tell me that there's doctors that say it's

2311
02:15:25.651 --> 02:15:30.000
actually more effective to orally rehydrate.
You just have to do it correctly.

2312
02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:33.870
Come on.
Sing this true Joe.
Because in,
in,

2313
02:15:34.170 --> 02:15:38.530
in hospitals they rehydrate you with Ivs.
Right,
right,
right.
But maybe the,

2314
02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:42.210
you have to regulate and ensure that you get the right amount of fluid at the

2315
02:15:42.211 --> 02:15:43.044
right time.

2316
02:15:43.170 --> 02:15:46.110
And maybe there's a method to rehydrate and a lot of the time when you just

2317
02:15:46.111 --> 02:15:48.600
drink,
obviously you'd have talked to scientists,

2318
02:15:48.630 --> 02:15:51.240
but when you drink just water rehydrate,

2319
02:15:51.241 --> 02:15:54.610
it strips the electrolytes and actually doesn't rehydrate you if you use the Ip,

2320
02:15:54.630 --> 02:15:58.410
goes straight to the bloodstream to rejuvenate those Allison,
I would thought,

2321
02:15:58.530 --> 02:16:01.470
but I'm obviously not medically qualified to talk about it,

2322
02:16:01.471 --> 02:16:05.760
but one thing that Jeff Novitsky told me is that they do it because people can

2323
02:16:05.761 --> 02:16:08.670
use ivs to mask steroids.
Who's Jeff?

2324
02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:11.160
Jeff to Wicki is the guy that busted Lance Armstrong.

2325
02:16:11.161 --> 02:16:13.380
He's the guy that's the new USA drug dude.

2326
02:16:13.410 --> 02:16:16.890
Well plus doping and Joe Sullivan,

2327
02:16:16.891 --> 02:16:21.220
the guy who works for the UFC said Ivs are bad.
Well,
no,
they didn't say that,

2328
02:16:21.630 --> 02:16:25.330
but he said you should use,
but he didn't say that it was more effective.
He's,

2329
02:16:25.370 --> 02:16:28.950
he doesn't,
he doesn't engage.
There's no Wicki guys.
Very impressive.
Okay.

2330
02:16:29.110 --> 02:16:30.160
He doesn't engage

2331
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:35.110
<v 0>in propaganda,
doesn't engage in hyperbole.
He's very logical and very calm.</v>

2332
02:16:35.111 --> 02:16:35.980
Very Fair.

2333
02:16:36.160 --> 02:16:39.310
I had a really good conversation with them and he's doing the podcast soon

2334
02:16:40.150 --> 02:16:41.620
because I need to,
you know,

2335
02:16:41.621 --> 02:16:45.520
I need to ask him a million questions about how these guys do things and how the

2336
02:16:45.521 --> 02:16:49.060
cyclists got away with it.
And we were talking about the Tour de France.

2337
02:16:49.061 --> 02:16:49.894
I was a good fight.

2338
02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:54.220
We were talking about the Tour de France and how this guy who was at the leader,

2339
02:16:54.221 --> 02:16:55.750
he goes,
he's got to be doing something.

2340
02:16:55.751 --> 02:16:58.990
He's breaking all the records at the juicers we're,
we're making.
He's like,

2341
02:16:58.991 --> 02:17:03.040
this guy is setting new record times and somehow or another he's testing clean.

2342
02:17:03.340 --> 02:17:06.820
And he said,
you know,
who knows what they're doing.
But the thing is they have,

2343
02:17:06.940 --> 02:17:10.960
they have steroids that they're developing testosterone that's not based on

2344
02:17:10.961 --> 02:17:13.720
plants.
Okay.
Because testosterone now though,
somehow or another,

2345
02:17:13.721 --> 02:17:16.730
they grow it with yams.
Wow.
Yeah.
It's crazy.
It's insane.

2346
02:17:16.980 --> 02:17:19.720
And there's somehow or another they can test and they can find that it's

2347
02:17:19.721 --> 02:17:23.650
[inaudible] and dodginess that it's exogenous.
Yes.
That's the word.

2348
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:26.050
They can't do that if it's animal stuff.

2349
02:17:26.051 --> 02:17:29.140
So they're figuring out a way to get testosterone for animals.

2350
02:17:29.530 --> 02:17:31.120
They're getting animal testosterone,

2351
02:17:31.121 --> 02:17:34.090
they're injecting it cause it mimics human bio identical.

2352
02:17:34.540 --> 02:17:36.400
It's bio identical and the can't figure out how to test it.

2353
02:17:36.401 --> 02:17:37.960
So if guys are doing that,

2354
02:17:38.170 --> 02:17:41.350
then it doesn't even look like they're on testosterone on a podcast can be so

2355
02:17:41.351 --> 02:17:44.380
dope.
Dude.
He's telling me crazy shit.

2356
02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:48.400
Tell me crazy shit about gene doping.
About the next level.
We,

2357
02:17:48.420 --> 02:17:51.130
you know I talked about what this with Rhonda Patrick on the podcast recently.

2358
02:17:51.131 --> 02:17:53.980
The next level it will by what you guys have to have her on.
Yeah,

2359
02:17:53.981 --> 02:17:57.460
we're going to have a real,
she'll blow your fucking listen to on your task her.

2360
02:17:57.490 --> 02:18:00.850
This is what you do cause for the fighter and the kid asked her to just study

2361
02:18:00.851 --> 02:18:05.080
steroids and what steroids you could hide and what steroids would do,

2362
02:18:05.081 --> 02:18:08.230
what and why you would take certain things where the benefits of it.
She'll look,

2363
02:18:08.231 --> 02:18:12.220
look through the research on it and come on your show and blow your fucking mind

2364
02:18:12.480 --> 02:18:16.210
below.
Really.
She's the smartest person I've ever talked to.
Whatever.
Yeah.

2365
02:18:16.211 --> 02:18:18.310
When I get her on the podcast,
just wind her up.

2366
02:18:18.370 --> 02:18:21.460
I just give her a subject like the last thing was cold shock protein.

2367
02:18:21.461 --> 02:18:25.900
She was talking about cryotherapy and the positive results of a sauna and that

2368
02:18:25.901 --> 02:18:30.100
sauna people had 40% less mortality across the board,

2369
02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:34.640
40% reduction in mortality,
whether it's cancer,
drugs,
a heart attack,

2370
02:18:36.460 --> 02:18:41.320
[inaudible] for longevity.
That's what she was saying.

2371
02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:44.680
There's something about heating your body up to 170 degrees.

2372
02:18:44.681 --> 02:18:48.580
You put it in that 170 degree environment for as long as the gins or something.

2373
02:18:48.581 --> 02:18:50.650
No,
it creates heat shock proteins.

2374
02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:53.950
She went into this big thing about heat shock proteins that are only create a

2375
02:18:53.951 --> 02:18:58.950
heat shock proteins and from cryotherapy,
very similar cold shock proteins.
Dude,

2376
02:18:58.951 --> 02:19:01.480
you've got to listen to the podcast because it's literally,
it's not even me.

2377
02:19:01.510 --> 02:19:02.343
It's like I would,

2378
02:19:02.500 --> 02:19:06.430
I would lob a ball at her and then I'd sit back for 20 minutes while she just

2379
02:19:06.431 --> 02:19:09.540
goes off and you've got to take notes.
You got to write shit down.
Damn,

2380
02:19:09.541 --> 02:19:13.120
she's a monster.
So getting your body at a certain temperature,
yes,

2381
02:19:13.450 --> 02:19:15.700
you relief triggers a compensatory response.

2382
02:19:15.730 --> 02:19:19.390
That compensatory response is called either heat shock proteins are cold shock

2383
02:19:19.391 --> 02:19:23.740
proteins and neoprene Efrin,
uh,
which is,
uh,
something that,
um,

2384
02:19:23.890 --> 02:19:28.050
it has an effect on mood and Nia.
How's it,
what's the word?
Net.

2385
02:19:28.060 --> 02:19:30.490
<v 2>Neff.
Richard Neal.
Knepper tramp.
What happened here?</v>

2386
02:19:30.580 --> 02:19:32.870
Fuck is that word that she is,
but anyway,
whatever it is,

2387
02:19:32.871 --> 02:19:36.680
it regulates I'm moody or your dairy.
Schwann.
Wow.

2388
02:19:36.990 --> 02:19:39.290
I didn't mean to cut you off Joe.
Sorry.
No worries.

2389
02:19:39.291 --> 02:19:41.000
Look at Michael Johnson's furious,
man.

2390
02:19:41.510 --> 02:19:43.520
I think Johnson definitely won that fight by the way.
We,

2391
02:19:43.550 --> 02:19:46.730
I do not think I was paying attention.
I was just enough.

2392
02:19:46.731 --> 02:19:49.890
You owe me dinner though,
and I found out that I shall like Daria,

2393
02:19:49.990 --> 02:19:54.590
she was actually robbed norepinephrine or epinephrine.
Thank you very much.
Sir.

2394
02:19:55.110 --> 02:19:58.030
Defined hasn't been booked yet either.
Oh,
it hasn't.
Which fight?
Which one?

2395
02:19:58.050 --> 02:20:02.600
White Man.
Black Hole.
They have to have a venue rumor that maybe December 5th,

2396
02:20:02.601 --> 02:20:04.700
but not officially yet.
Oh,
you know what?

2397
02:20:04.701 --> 02:20:07.580
I bet it's the big one because they're trying to do a big one December 5th.

2398
02:20:07.581 --> 02:20:08.900
That's what knucklehead shouldn't the shot.

2399
02:20:08.970 --> 02:20:13.070
She kept her mouth shut about the UFC calling in Dallas.
Yeah,

2400
02:20:13.071 --> 02:20:14.330
that's what they're saying.
They're saying,
listen,

2401
02:20:14.350 --> 02:20:18.740
you make one 35 if you may one 35 in Dallas,
December 5th let's do this.

2402
02:20:19.010 --> 02:20:22.190
But they got to,
she's going to have to get on the scale before they ever,

2403
02:20:22.220 --> 02:20:25.970
she's going to have to wait before bond is doing movies and shit so it has to

2404
02:20:25.971 --> 02:20:29.270
work for Rhonda Schedule II.
Well it's going to be December 5th if that,

2405
02:20:29.271 --> 02:20:32.000
if it's the big funds like rocky too.
This is what they're trying to do.

2406
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:36.470
December 5th they're trying to do a gigantic arena in Dallas,

2407
02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:40.880
that huge football stadium and if they do cowboy stadium it is going to be the

2408
02:20:40.881 --> 02:20:43.460
motherfucker evolve motherfucker cards dude.

2409
02:20:43.490 --> 02:20:46.160
It's going to be like McGregor versus Aldo.

2410
02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:51.280
Rhonda versus Cyborg and if they signed fade or versus for doom and that's also

2411
02:20:51.561 --> 02:20:56.561
on the card and I also saw verse Holy Shit over and will be versus dos Santos

2412
02:20:59.270 --> 02:21:02.480
most likely you think they'll ever do a super bowl,
the card like that.

2413
02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:03.770
That would be the big card.

2414
02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:08.800
That would be the cross to do like and then Yolanda versus Claudia once a year.

2415
02:21:09.081 --> 02:21:14.040
Right?
Once a year.
If you have a supercar goddamn year.
Gimme a supercard.

2416
02:21:14.780 --> 02:21:18.060
Well,
there are apparently planning UFC 200 for now.

2417
02:21:18.770 --> 02:21:22.430
They're already advertising you.
Yeah,
there's half Al Cordero.
Great Guy.

2418
02:21:22.550 --> 02:21:26.230
Awesome coach just,
but it was so beautiful dude.
Always late.

2419
02:21:26.540 --> 02:21:30.970
Beautiful smile and just a warm friendly guide is true.
Loves a students.

2420
02:21:31.340 --> 02:21:34.790
Great Guy.
So they're already showing these teaser trailers would UFC 200,

2421
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:38.420
which is next July.
So they're planning it.
Here's a fucking stud.

2422
02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:40.430
Matt Hughes and Stoller.

2423
02:21:40.740 --> 02:21:45.740
Robbie Lawler healed up like partners like Wolverine Wolverine.

2424
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:48.910
You can't even tell him he was split open.
So awesome.

2425
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:53.380
Too rough looking at UFC two hunters can be fucked dude.
How about,
um,

2426
02:21:53.440 --> 02:21:57.800
they're going to do Robbie Lawler versus Carlos Condit.
Brian County was called,

2427
02:21:57.801 --> 02:22:00.620
I can't wait for that.
How about this fight right here?

2428
02:22:00.650 --> 02:22:05.650
Max Hot Maxa versus a Olivera Max Holloway's a bad motherfucker did this going

2429
02:22:06.111 --> 02:22:10.340
on right now.
Connor,
this is coming up.
I called this one today too.
I did a um,

2430
02:22:11.090 --> 02:22:14.270
uh,
what else count on shells for this Max Holloway impressed though.

2431
02:22:14.271 --> 02:22:17.410
Fuck out of me.
Versus can you do those countdown shows?
Joe here,
I,

2432
02:22:17.470 --> 02:22:21.230
two of them near this area.
Gotcha.
Hernia,

2433
02:22:22.660 --> 02:22:26.640
California.
Well,
I didn't know if you have to go to like a UFC studio or what?
No,

2434
02:22:26.641 --> 02:22:28.830
we go to a sound studio.
Gotcha.
Yeah,
just a place.

2435
02:22:28.860 --> 02:22:32.190
There's a hundred of those spots in place.
Have you ever done those?
I do.

2436
02:22:32.430 --> 02:22:35.790
I do one for a video game too,
man.
I've been doing the video game again.

2437
02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:40.090
I did one for them for the top five greatest fights of all time and I went to a

2438
02:22:40.150 --> 02:22:43.890
unbreakable gym and just like,
oh,
that's cool.
Yeah.
Eric Sylville.
Rick Story.

2439
02:22:43.890 --> 02:22:48.200
Holy Shit.
That's a great fight.
Max Holloway and Charles Oliveira.

2440
02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:51.690
I fucking love that.
Jay Berkman to fun find boys.
What date is that?

2441
02:22:51.691 --> 02:22:54.930
August 23rd and we doing this or what?
It's a sudden day.

2442
02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:58.630
That sounds like a good day to do a fucking fight companion.
Who's here?

2443
02:22:59.430 --> 02:23:03.630
Who's here?
Hell yeah,
man.
I'm here.
We're going to on it and next week.

2444
02:23:03.631 --> 02:23:07.380
But that's it.
Then we go to Costa Rica next week.
It's a Sunday.

2445
02:23:07.381 --> 02:23:12.381
I like her next month on the 23rd which doing or not doing them 100% not doing

2446
02:23:12.391 --> 02:23:15.130
it.
No.
That's a fight.
That's a fight night.
Joe Says,
nut,

2447
02:23:16.420 --> 02:23:19.350
that's Brian Stann do.
It's going to come to w one day.

2448
02:23:19.351 --> 02:23:20.280
This is going to be too fun.

2449
02:23:20.580 --> 02:23:23.760
It's going to be like fight companion is going to be more fun than actually

2450
02:23:23.761 --> 02:23:26.280
being there at the fights.
Dude,
when I text you guys,

2451
02:23:26.330 --> 02:23:29.180
and especially when I take you,
I'm like,
Bro,
fight campaign for this.
You're like,

2452
02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:32.280
I'm out of town.
I'm like,
oh,
I know,
but it makes it sad.

2453
02:23:32.340 --> 02:23:35.760
When you said the other day and I said,
fuck yeah,
and you said fuck yeah,

2454
02:23:35.761 --> 02:23:40.380
so it makes my week.
He texted me FICA,

2455
02:23:40.381 --> 02:23:42.250
padded.
I go,
fuck yeah,
Shit.

2456
02:23:42.270 --> 02:23:44.970
The stars are aligning and then Callen cal tech's fee.

2457
02:23:44.971 --> 02:23:48.000
We're all texting each other.
The gang is back.

2458
02:23:49.710 --> 02:23:53.160
Ladies and gentlemen,
when we did think of painting without you,
it felt weird,

2459
02:23:53.161 --> 02:23:55.800
man.
How about Bobby girlfriend stole the show,

2460
02:23:56.270 --> 02:24:00.660
drop some knowledge shit.
She knew a lot more than I did.
Shut down,

2461
02:24:01.410 --> 02:24:04.260
shut down
totally body.

2462
02:24:04.380 --> 02:24:07.590
She was on the Filipino national swimming teams.

2463
02:24:08.910 --> 02:24:10.390
You're saying?
Yes.

2464
02:24:10.410 --> 02:24:13.920
If you have a woman as dominant as Ronda a man,

2465
02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:17.250
you're going to have to be some sort of an odd balance.

2466
02:24:18.180 --> 02:24:20.880
Man is submissive and small as Bobby Lee.

2467
02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:23.550
You're going to have to have a woman that takes up the slack.

2468
02:24:23.610 --> 02:24:27.600
I guess Wanda needs like a fucking Thor.
Just,
yeah,
just

2469
02:24:29.390 --> 02:24:31.320
like she's not going to go for Brock Lesnar.

2470
02:24:32.690 --> 02:24:37.250
Todd Duffy that's been in a lab like to toss artificial.

2471
02:24:37.490 --> 02:24:40.080
She's so Richie's and have some dude artificially created.

2472
02:24:40.270 --> 02:24:42.960
But like you were the one of the ones that said that Todd Duffy,

2473
02:24:42.961 --> 02:24:45.240
he's like insanely physically talented.
Right?

2474
02:24:45.330 --> 02:24:49.540
One of the bet might be the best I've ever seen in the gym.
Really mentally,

2475
02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:51.870
mentally.
It's just,
he struggles.

2476
02:24:51.910 --> 02:24:55.380
He's lost a few times by knockout and that's not even men's heavyweight can just

2477
02:24:55.381 --> 02:24:57.810
get cracked.
But if you see him move,

2478
02:24:58.020 --> 02:25:02.220
he's got an extremely impressive way of movement.

2479
02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:05.160
Like there's like,
this is a hard to describe,

2480
02:25:05.161 --> 02:25:08.070
but when you see guys fight so many times,

2481
02:25:08.071 --> 02:25:10.470
you see like thousands of thousands of fights up close.

2482
02:25:10.620 --> 02:25:15.620
One of the things you notice is if someone's sloppy in their movement,

2483
02:25:15.660 --> 02:25:17.250
if they're sloppy in their movement,

2484
02:25:17.251 --> 02:25:19.980
that they're probably sloppy in their thinking and they're probably sloppy

2485
02:25:19.981 --> 02:25:22.410
somehow in their preparation and it might just be a little bit,

2486
02:25:22.530 --> 02:25:23.890
but that little might be

2487
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:24.701
<v 0>they get,</v>

2488
02:25:24.701 --> 02:25:28.600
they pull back and then they relax and then they get back up and then they go
in.

2489
02:25:28.810 --> 02:25:33.220
Whereas some some,
some guys have this like super efficient movement.

2490
02:25:33.221 --> 02:25:37.840
Like Anderson Anderson in his prime had this super efficient movement.

2491
02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:39.910
There was no slop in anything he did.

2492
02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:43.720
So when Anderson moved in on you and when he uncorked Shit on you,

2493
02:25:43.721 --> 02:25:46.510
it was just shooting.
It was just coming in out of nowhere,

2494
02:25:46.630 --> 02:25:48.580
which was half the magic of what he did.

2495
02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:52.720
He said there was fractions in milliseconds of things that were missing and his

2496
02:25:52.721 --> 02:25:55.780
movement that were available in other people's things you couldn't read,

2497
02:25:56.020 --> 02:25:57.430
couldn't read and he would do shit.

2498
02:25:57.431 --> 02:26:00.490
Like he was setting you up for stuff and you didn't know like when he find

2499
02:26:00.491 --> 02:26:03.600
kicked veto in the face three setting,
he was setting them up for,

2500
02:26:03.700 --> 02:26:05.260
he just saw the tours movement.

2501
02:26:05.260 --> 02:26:08.800
He saw how it's going in saying yeah and it comes out of nowhere and next thing

2502
02:26:08.801 --> 02:26:12.490
you know it's the ball of the foot to your chin.
That's there's,
there's some,

2503
02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:15.910
some guys don't recognize that unless you train that way,

2504
02:26:16.150 --> 02:26:17.950
unless you have this very,

2505
02:26:18.130 --> 02:26:22.720
very like a miserly approach to movement.
Like all that extra shit,

2506
02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:27.160
all this slicey where the hand drops or it comes with everything has to be

2507
02:26:27.161 --> 02:26:30.610
locked.
Like you watched Yolanda,
you want to inject check when she moves in,

2508
02:26:30.730 --> 02:26:35.170
that pitch is like locked down in lethal.
Everything is super efficient.

2509
02:26:35.350 --> 02:26:36.760
Like when you see her moving in,

2510
02:26:36.910 --> 02:26:40.450
everything is just locked into position and when the techniques come off its

2511
02:26:42.300 --> 02:26:45.310
way Duffy's that weight training,
that's what I'm saying.

2512
02:26:45.311 --> 02:26:50.170
This is why I think he has a,
uh,
the mental games not there for him.

2513
02:26:50.171 --> 02:26:53.020
Because when I saw him fight Frank Mir,
I'm like,
what the fuck are you doing?

2514
02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:55.840
Why are you running with your chin down,
throwing bombs?

2515
02:26:55.930 --> 02:27:00.180
He got excited if we'll side with that.
But that's everything.
You're right.

2516
02:27:00.640 --> 02:27:03.740
He's,
he's,
so,
I'm telling you,
man in the gym and I,

2517
02:27:03.850 --> 02:27:08.020
he went to Ak and I asked Daniel Cormier,
my calc gets Todd Duffy goes,
Bro,

2518
02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:12.430
that guy's a fucking monster and went right.
But for whatever reason,

2519
02:27:12.431 --> 02:27:14.110
it's just not translating.
So,
and this is,

2520
02:27:14.111 --> 02:27:16.240
this is a good way to tell if a guy's mentally strong,

2521
02:27:16.330 --> 02:27:18.460
and I'm not saying Todd's nut,
but there's an issue.

2522
02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:20.980
Look at the guys he's beat and then look,

2523
02:27:20.981 --> 02:27:24.100
when he fights someone who doesn't back down,
he's not scared of your body,

2524
02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:28.030
who's not scared of your previous records.
When you fight a vet who's like,

2525
02:27:28.090 --> 02:27:32.430
what you did?
What?
I'm not going to get knocked down by a single pump.
Well,

2526
02:27:32.431 --> 02:27:35.470
you know,
that's when you can tell the guy's record his defense.

2527
02:27:35.470 --> 02:27:37.810
He's had a long time off the UFC.

2528
02:27:37.811 --> 02:27:41.560
He went through a lot of health issues and I think he's getting back on track

2529
02:27:41.740 --> 02:27:44.500
and I think he doesn't have a lot of recent experience.

2530
02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:47.710
I mean he's got that one Anthony Hamilton fight where he knocked him out.

2531
02:27:47.711 --> 02:27:50.670
He looks spectacular in that fight.
And how many other fights is he has to it?

2532
02:27:50.680 --> 02:27:53.500
I think that's it.
I think that these back,
it's just that one.
Yeah.

2533
02:27:53.501 --> 02:27:55.840
That was his first fight back case with them before that.

2534
02:27:55.930 --> 02:28:00.310
But the lack of experience,
like he's his recent experience like for sure,
but,

2535
02:28:00.311 --> 02:28:04.240
but,
but think about,
so he's,
you know,
you look at the guy,
he's,
he's beat,

2536
02:28:04.300 --> 02:28:06.430
you know,
he really hasn't been any big names.
Right.

2537
02:28:06.431 --> 02:28:08.320
But he hasn't fought any big names either.

2538
02:28:08.350 --> 02:28:11.650
He's the only fun style holster when he was in fraud.
Allister,

2539
02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:14.310
when Alister was on,
they

2540
02:28:18.370 --> 02:28:22.200
don't pull in lava out of the fucking right.

2541
02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:27.110
<v 1>Out of insight right into his
duty.</v>

2542
02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:30.780
Have you ever seen that surfer bro?
Even real human,
you know,

2543
02:28:30.781 --> 02:28:34.280
like silver surface services running over does a video,

2544
02:28:35.860 --> 02:28:39.970
the video of you looking at him as he's weighing in and you're just like,
ah.

2545
02:28:40.010 --> 02:28:44.180
That was when he fought Brock.
Oh my guy to 65 that was before they,

2546
02:28:44.240 --> 02:28:46.820
they all they did was urine tests back.
That's the only,

2547
02:28:46.850 --> 02:28:50.630
that's the only fight I've ever seen where when he weighed in I thought we're

2548
02:28:50.631 --> 02:28:54.180
all fucked.
Yeah,
we're calling dye wash up.
I should just retire right now.

2549
02:28:55.160 --> 02:28:56.390
You have to fight those guys.

2550
02:28:56.391 --> 02:28:59.610
Alistair Overeem the whole medicine cabinet and said,
have at it.
Sorry.

2551
02:29:01.920 --> 02:29:05.510
The most terrifying guy of all time.
He would never lose.
Yeah.

2552
02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:08.180
At his best when he was,
whatever he was on,

2553
02:29:08.181 --> 02:29:11.660
if he was on anything or now we know he got caught,
but who knows where.
That was

2554
02:29:14.330 --> 02:29:18.710
nice.
I liked the guy,
but my point being when he was that guy,

2555
02:29:18.711 --> 02:29:23.010
when he fought in k one like that,
when he was just jack to the fucking tidbits,

2556
02:29:23.020 --> 02:29:24.880
strict test,
he was a monster.
He had,

2557
02:29:24.881 --> 02:29:27.770
they made sure you were Ontario several days they test you and not enough.

2558
02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:30.260
He was a monster.
He's a monster.

2559
02:29:30.261 --> 02:29:34.820
I think that him at that level when he's at that level would be super hard to

2560
02:29:34.821 --> 02:29:35.270
beat.

2561
02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:39.080
But it's like when you get used to competing like that and you get used to being

2562
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:41.000
at that level and then you're no longer anymore,

2563
02:29:41.001 --> 02:29:44.790
then the mental game kicks in for sure.
Hey Man,
don't look at him.
Look at

2564
02:29:46.370 --> 02:29:51.360
that photo.
He went first and Mister Olympia looking at that
body,

2565
02:29:51.490 --> 02:29:54.440
look at his arms.
You know he used to find that two or five.

2566
02:29:54.570 --> 02:29:57.850
I know I didn't say it to a five but I remember

2567
02:29:59.750 --> 02:30:04.310
the crazy thing is he said it was from horsemeat horseman and everyone and some

2568
02:30:04.311 --> 02:30:06.590
people find it.
Some people I was like what?

2569
02:30:07.250 --> 02:30:10.250
And then you pay your horse meat.
He's an answer to.

2570
02:30:10.251 --> 02:30:13.250
He never lets me look like Kermit the frog.
It's really crazy.

2571
02:30:13.251 --> 02:30:14.750
He's not even pumped up there.

2572
02:30:15.230 --> 02:30:18.350
See that's a guy who was just flacid and flexing.

2573
02:30:18.590 --> 02:30:21.620
Like when you lift weights it so thing like if you see a photo of someone and

2574
02:30:21.621 --> 02:30:22.490
they look giant,

2575
02:30:22.610 --> 02:30:25.540
they might've just lift weights and the arms literally get like twice.

2576
02:30:26.450 --> 02:30:28.080
You get pumped up and chill in there.

2577
02:30:28.160 --> 02:30:33.160
He's just relaxing in his underwear on a scale in [inaudible] Lesnar kicked

2578
02:30:33.471 --> 02:30:35.270
right in the fucking liver was like,
oh fuck.

2579
02:30:35.300 --> 02:30:38.550
This guy kicked right where he has served.
Yes.
I mean that's purpose.

2580
02:30:38.730 --> 02:30:43.430
The guy had 12 inches of his colon removed and then he fought a year later we

2581
02:30:43.431 --> 02:30:46.630
got 500 on this.
Right.
We've got five Honda man.
You think he's going to lose?

2582
02:30:47.570 --> 02:30:50.480
I think he's going to,
no,
I think osps get a win.

2583
02:30:50.720 --> 02:30:54.860
But just for the fun of this show,
I got clover take,
but for the record,

2584
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:58.100
but I want to,
I wanna uh,
know that,

2585
02:30:58.101 --> 02:31:01.650
that that's how you can take global,
global,

2586
02:31:01.730 --> 02:31:03.440
I think global is going to win by submission.

2587
02:31:03.670 --> 02:31:05.740
Some it's going to really hurt your feelings change over.

2588
02:31:05.800 --> 02:31:08.980
It's going to block and knock them out.
Glover's wanting to hurt.

2589
02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:12.980
I just want to go over as a very composed,

2590
02:31:13.130 --> 02:31:16.850
when constant Prue knocked out Pat Cummins,
he woke me up.

2591
02:31:16.880 --> 02:31:20.120
My eyes won't be knocked out.
The

2592
02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:23.580
<v 0>nice apricots think his back foot.
I think he's talented as fuck.</v>

2593
02:31:23.581 --> 02:31:26.310
I've always loved what he's doing is he's getting better.

2594
02:31:26.311 --> 02:31:29.160
He's getting more and more skillful in the way he knock out Shogun with that

2595
02:31:29.161 --> 02:31:32.970
beautiful step aside.
Left hook confidence is a big thing.
He likes twist.

2596
02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:34.050
That was spectacular.

2597
02:31:35.820 --> 02:31:40.450
He's got all these victories by knockout and he's like the twist.
Who?

2598
02:31:40.920 --> 02:31:45.870
Dobby guy.
I think he's the only guy in history in MMA.

2599
02:31:45.930 --> 02:31:48.790
He got someone in the truck and got him on a calf crank.
He's,

2600
02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:52.980
he's always in the truck.
Go scars on his arm.
I'm going to say some omega.

2601
02:31:53.990 --> 02:31:58.800
They burned them.
That would make you like,
wouldn't that create some texture?

2602
02:31:59.250 --> 02:32:03.330
Wouldn't that make it difficult like for you to slip out of stuff?
Like if you,

2603
02:32:03.331 --> 02:32:06.420
if you decide if someone was so gangster,
they discard a scar.

2604
02:32:06.990 --> 02:32:11.040
All their arms from their wrist all the way up to the top of their shoulder so

2605
02:32:11.041 --> 02:32:13.950
they have a more textured skin so I can get a chokes.

2606
02:32:14.400 --> 02:32:17.570
So he couldn't slip out of good teams and slept dedication,
bro.

2607
02:32:17.590 --> 02:32:22.590
Somebody found out if someone found out that there was a way of creating scarf

2608
02:32:22.651 --> 02:32:27.210
vacation than made a textured surface.
It and scars don't sweat the same way.

2609
02:32:27.250 --> 02:32:30.390
A restrict skin swells burn their skin like dark man.

2610
02:32:30.620 --> 02:32:35.280
So many did that a long process and created like a super textured skin.

2611
02:32:35.610 --> 02:32:39.490
All of their products Friday Kruger Bro.
Like Freddy

2612
02:32:41.200 --> 02:32:44.760
does that well think about,
hey do do a lot of scarification.
Yeah and Africa,

2613
02:32:44.761 --> 02:32:45.860
they actually date,
they try,

2614
02:32:45.870 --> 02:32:49.050
they scratch their backs and sometimes they die and go into shock and all that,

2615
02:32:49.051 --> 02:32:52.560
but they,
they'll scan our entire back to look like a crocodile.
Yeah,

2616
02:32:52.561 --> 02:32:57.360
I've seen that.
I think by far the better athlete.

2617
02:32:57.361 --> 02:33:01.650
I just think Glover has more experience and dude,
when I trained with Glover,

2618
02:33:01.680 --> 02:33:04.350
his wrestling and grappling,
he,
he hasn't showed it much,

2619
02:33:04.351 --> 02:33:08.760
but he's a fucking nightmare.
Well his,
his top game is heavy.

2620
02:33:08.761 --> 02:33:11.010
When he got Kyle Kingsbury in the ground,
you could see like,
Ooh,

2621
02:33:11.011 --> 02:33:14.580
that's a heavy top game.
His arm chairs,
I'm like a sweater,

2622
02:33:14.620 --> 02:33:18.180
Joe Sweat coming in and [inaudible] Chuck Liddell.
Right.

2623
02:33:18.181 --> 02:33:20.940
But also you gotta think those six years he was out of the UFC,

2624
02:33:20.941 --> 02:33:24.900
we're six years of his prime.
When he was chuckling.
Dell's main training partner,

2625
02:33:24.901 --> 02:33:29.040
but he's high on them.
We stopped.
Uh,
he was the first guy to,
um,

2626
02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:32.790
uh,
what the fuck is his name?
It looks like the Predator,
the crazy dreadlocks.

2627
02:33:33.420 --> 02:33:36.630
So could you,
he was the first guy that knocked out,
so yep.
He knocked out.

2628
02:33:36.631 --> 02:33:40.260
So could you and the WAAC or was the WEC or palace?

2629
02:33:42.130 --> 02:33:46.710
It was WC.
WC.
And uh,
that was the first time I saw Glover.
Fine.
I was like,
Whoa,

2630
02:33:46.711 --> 02:33:49.700
this dude,
he's gangster.
There's so much hype on them though.

2631
02:33:49.710 --> 02:33:53.010
From everyone though.
Yeah,
but you gotta think,
man.
He's like,
what?

2632
02:33:53.011 --> 02:33:56.880
37 38 now how old is he?
36 Jamie.

2633
02:33:57.720 --> 02:34:00.690
Find out how old the Glover is all man.
Reality.
It's fucking,
man.

2634
02:34:00.720 --> 02:34:03.300
The reality is if he's not doing anything,

2635
02:34:03.630 --> 02:34:06.990
if you get to this stage in boxing,
if you get to this stage,

2636
02:34:06.991 --> 02:34:09.150
like back in the day when no one was taking anything,
right,

2637
02:34:09.151 --> 02:34:12.760
like the Marvin Hagler era,
we assume nobody was taking anything.
It's hope,

2638
02:34:12.870 --> 02:34:16.590
but guy got to be like 36 it's a fucking end of the road over over.

2639
02:34:16.650 --> 02:34:18.080
All dogs go to heaven.
Yeah,
sober.

2640
02:34:18.350 --> 02:34:21.670
<v 2>All Tom's going to have the line of the night.</v>

2641
02:34:22.150 --> 02:34:24.550
It's over and it's true.
All dogs got it.

2642
02:34:24.551 --> 02:34:27.430
Is it was the line of the night earlier was,
yeah,

2643
02:34:28.810 --> 02:34:32.680
there was another one before that team
now,
but there's even,

2644
02:34:32.681 --> 02:34:35.590
there's another one too.
I don't really know.
Why don't you just stand up?

2645
02:34:36.310 --> 02:34:39.910
Come on dude.
You can do it.
Believe me,
if you could do it on this podcast,

2646
02:34:39.911 --> 02:34:43.180
you can do it on stage.
You would love it.
I agree.
You 100% could do it.

2647
02:34:43.330 --> 02:34:44.170
This is what you should do.

2648
02:34:44.230 --> 02:34:46.690
I just want to do it and hang out with you guys at night anytime.

2649
02:34:47.570 --> 02:34:51.820
I just want to recently,
I know.
How am I going to start writing and just,

2650
02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:54.790
I will go over some stuff and just get up and that's what you guys,

2651
02:34:54.880 --> 02:34:56.530
here's what you do.
This is your move ready.

2652
02:34:56.770 --> 02:35:00.850
You go on the road with Brian and Brian brings you up and you do like five

2653
02:35:00.851 --> 02:35:04.240
minutes.
That's it.
He tells a story for five minutes.
Even if it bombs,

2654
02:35:04.241 --> 02:35:07.510
you laugh and then you bring him back and then you know everything's groovy

2655
02:35:07.511 --> 02:35:10.780
cause he's just no expectations.
He's sick.
I mean I'm not scared.

2656
02:35:11.090 --> 02:35:12.480
I just don't want to disrespect.

2657
02:35:13.270 --> 02:35:16.540
Disrespect like saying I don't want to try Jujitsu cause I don't want to

2658
02:35:16.541 --> 02:35:19.930
disrespect you Jitsu.
Everything else.
Everybody sucks at first.

2659
02:35:20.180 --> 02:35:22.780
And you'll be funny because you're funny.
You're ready.
Great Dude.

2660
02:35:22.781 --> 02:35:24.870
You could do it 100% I'm down right now.

2661
02:35:25.140 --> 02:35:29.290
Keyboard warriors all across America goal you guys,
you're fucking ridiculous.

2662
02:35:29.291 --> 02:35:30.520
He's not funny.

2663
02:35:30.521 --> 02:35:35.020
He's a fucking share screen and everyone's not funny.

2664
02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:38.060
You're not funny.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

2665
02:35:38.890 --> 02:35:43.210
Stop trying to get everybody to do comedy.
Stop telling everybody.
Do a podcast.

2666
02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:47.110
It worked.
Look,
they got guys worked at Ted.
The podcast is stellar.

2667
02:35:47.620 --> 02:35:49.970
Let's start down.
The biggest thing to start doing,

2668
02:35:49.990 --> 02:35:52.120
I want to get you after five minutes,
you're gonna come on the road with me.

2669
02:35:53.650 --> 02:35:56.950
You can do it easy.
By the way,
just tell,
start by telling a story.
Giant,

2670
02:35:56.951 --> 02:36:01.120
crazy live show.
If he did that,
it'd be nuts.
He's 35 then we got our live show,

2671
02:36:01.121 --> 02:36:05.980
by the way.
October 1st Bram,
Bram prom tickets just went on sale.

2672
02:36:05.981 --> 02:36:09.160
First live show.
Just went on sale shoots.
Oh,

2673
02:36:09.161 --> 02:36:12.670
I'm going to be at the Cop Theater September 4th in Vegas with Ian Edwards and

2674
02:36:12.671 --> 02:36:16.340
Greg Fitzsimmons.
Ooh,
we just had Greg gun.
He's a funny dude.
He's,

2675
02:36:16.350 --> 02:36:19.030
he said you gotta let roommates and then of course I went,

2676
02:36:19.060 --> 02:36:21.490
you ever seen his dick?
And he went,
no I didn't.
I went,

2677
02:36:21.491 --> 02:36:23.620
you were roommates know checked out his dick.
Yeah,

2678
02:36:23.680 --> 02:36:26.250
I hear Greg's got a piece on him though.
I,
that's the rumor.

2679
02:36:26.290 --> 02:36:30.650
I just have a little Dick.
It's not little.
Well,
no,
he said it's like winning.

2680
02:36:30.900 --> 02:36:34.210
I'm just,
well he's a little guy.
You don't have to throw you off.
Yeah.

2681
02:36:34.211 --> 02:36:37.470
If that was like three off and Rothwell wouldn't look so big.
There you go.
Oh,

2682
02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:38.390
you're going to be here next week.

2683
02:36:38.770 --> 02:36:43.030
Ben Looks like his music or just saying he shoots gimme a hug the other day.

2684
02:36:43.031 --> 02:36:46.960
I was like,
he's so big,
so big and hairy.
It wasn't like fighting that dude.

2685
02:36:48.330 --> 02:36:50.230
I was so cocky.
I thought I was going to smoke them.

2686
02:36:50.231 --> 02:36:55.231
I thought was spinning elbow landed because I never trained before.

2687
02:36:55.421 --> 02:36:56.410
I saw John do it.
I was like,
Oh,

2688
02:36:56.411 --> 02:37:00.220
I'm going to do that against Rothwell never trained it.
Landed,
wobbled him.

2689
02:37:00.430 --> 02:37:04.000
Guess what?
The last words before I went in the cage cage,
my coaches know me.

2690
02:37:04.001 --> 02:37:06.610
They go,
listen,
you have better cardio.
Better technique.

2691
02:37:06.820 --> 02:37:09.130
Let's drag this in the third round.
Yeah.
Cool.

2692
02:37:09.220 --> 02:37:14.100
When in spin an elbow nuts knocked out.
I like this

2693
02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:24.530
<v 1>bad idea.
Here we go.
Open.
Same proof.
Find out a Knoxville,
Tennessee bitches.</v>

2694
02:37:25.010 --> 02:37:30.010
I think it's crazy that Bruce buffer does all this amazing passionate shit and

2695
02:37:30.531 --> 02:37:32.930
they never show it on TV.
I love watching it.

2696
02:37:32.931 --> 02:37:34.850
It's one of my favorite things to water show it.

2697
02:37:34.970 --> 02:37:39.740
They was cut to that like a crowd shot might be one of my favorite Americans.

2698
02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:44.720
Terrorist Swift said it best.
Haters.
Gonna hate hate.
That's a nice song.

2699
02:37:45.020 --> 02:37:45.853
It's true.

2700
02:37:46.940 --> 02:37:50.660
Those lyrics notice for Bruce.

2701
02:37:50.661 --> 02:37:53.810
Buffer is going off right now.
He's listened to it.
Can we hear it Jamie?

2702
02:37:53.870 --> 02:37:55.800
He's going off.
We just don't see them.

2703
02:37:56.510 --> 02:38:01.280
What's basically over here?
Here we go.

2704
02:38:01.820 --> 02:38:06.500
Here we go.
Keep it cranking.
Did he jumps and spins right here?
Watch.

2705
02:38:07.180 --> 02:38:11.690
Look at it.
Yeah.
They pulled back on them.
They hold back.

2706
02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:15.530
You got a little dish.
Why hate on Bruce?
I don't know.
Here's the,

2707
02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:18.560
they're going to do the best ref in the game right there.

2708
02:38:18.980 --> 02:38:22.400
Give him the reach around,
right?
That big boys got to set a tits on him.

2709
02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:23.990
He's just some big fighters right here.

2710
02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:28.220
I liked the big John's doing this and the two married a good referee here.

2711
02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:33.230
I wonder why Bruce doesn't just give big John to Mike.
So you take the mic.

2712
02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:37.920
Hey hear.
Hear me out.
Hear me out here.
Why not?
What?
OSP,
right.
Uh,

2713
02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:42.770
USA Glover.
Brazil.
Why not have the trunks if you're going to do them like that,

2714
02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:44.810
they have this name,
but to make it different,

2715
02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:49.770
why not have the trunks a yellow and green and black and then have osps really

2716
02:38:49.780 --> 02:38:54.710
say killer.
It's a bad idea,
bro.
His wrestling is fucking good.

2717
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:58.970
OSB early,
early.
It's tough to take down.
Trust me.
Super tough.
Take down.

2718
02:38:59.090 --> 02:38:59.901
As the rounds go on,

2719
02:38:59.901 --> 02:39:04.190
it gets easier and easier as clover took him right to Osp off his back.
No Bueno.

2720
02:39:04.460 --> 02:39:06.850
No Bueno.
Just took him right down,
right and a half card.

2721
02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:10.100
That was him to pay you right now too.
That was impressive.

2722
02:39:10.130 --> 02:39:14.180
I can pay you next time a year.
It's kind of fun.
He's a beast on the ground,
man.

2723
02:39:14.210 --> 02:39:17.930
Super Beast on top.
So dangerous on top.
He's got such good control.

2724
02:39:17.950 --> 02:39:20.930
You know what LSPs worst thing is?
Oh,
look at all that great control.

2725
02:39:21.020 --> 02:39:24.360
All so great little ground and pounds.
You'd osps hips.

2726
02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:30.350
You're right though.
No,
you're right.
No,
but he look,
Osp got out of there,
man.

2727
02:39:30.351 --> 02:39:34.640
For sure.
Oh,
low rates.
Osps hips,
manners from football.

2728
02:39:34.730 --> 02:39:39.590
Someone doesn't have a diamond cup.
Diamond MMA cups.
Gotta have a Diamond Cup.

2729
02:39:39.980 --> 02:39:41.350
Took one right to the jewels.

2730
02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:45.200
Just like a diamond shaped piss whole took one to the Asai Berries.

2731
02:39:46.540 --> 02:39:50.040
That's never fun.
Especially my trying to grind to get help.
Okay.

2732
02:39:50.060 --> 02:39:54.010
Right now he lied because it just takes way longer than no.
Sometimes.
No.

2733
02:39:54.020 --> 02:39:56.560
Sometimes there's pressure,
man.
You don't need five minutes for no,

2734
02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:01.420
but there's pressure.
The fans are like,
come on is obviously levels of healing.

2735
02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:06.370
We're going to size of his ass.
I'm like Jesus.
Oh,

2736
02:40:08.020 --> 02:40:10.890
Oh,
you rock them my money right now.
Oh my God.

2737
02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:17.540
Look at this.
Opens has got ahold of,
look at this bull shit.
You pay me?

2738
02:40:17.550 --> 02:40:22.020
No.
Oh,
Hammer fist.
Did he pay me now?
200 bucks.
No Sir.
200 bucks.

2739
02:40:22.021 --> 02:40:24.810
Just give it to me.
No Sir.
Oh,
look at his elbow.

2740
02:40:24.980 --> 02:40:29.760
I'll wait then to open st proves a monster.
Super Athletic Monster.

2741
02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:34.760
Oh,
he's funny.
He's super fucked up.
Oh,
speeds about to win.
Go over.

2742
02:40:34.761 --> 02:40:36.150
It's very good in these situations.

2743
02:40:36.151 --> 02:40:39.760
So it's how he knocked out Ryan Bader to the body,
man.
Oh,

2744
02:40:41.730 --> 02:40:46.020
look at this.
When you go straight to mouth.
Kidding me.

2745
02:40:46.070 --> 02:40:50.340
Robos,
lovers,
ground game.
Ah,
crazy fight.
Hey,

2746
02:40:50.341 --> 02:40:53.370
he's going to roll cause there he goes.
He's,
he gives back but he's high.

2747
02:40:53.371 --> 02:40:58.230
He's high on the back man.
He's signed the back.
Oh Jesus.

2748
02:40:58.231 --> 02:41:02.790
Good control.
But you kidding me,
right?
He likes that arm triangle.
Oh boy.

2749
02:41:03.030 --> 02:41:05.900
Whoo.
There's going to explore that a damn ground game.

2750
02:41:06.500 --> 02:41:10.880
Explain a lot of time on Friday.
Bravo loyalty.
He will.
I hear you dude.

2751
02:41:10.881 --> 02:41:13.980
But you gotta be impressive.
Go over here.
No,
you're not impressed.

2752
02:41:14.490 --> 02:41:18.270
Hey yes,
do it.
This is wicked.
And plus he was tested here.

2753
02:41:18.450 --> 02:41:23.450
I love omits his left kick man that left to the and got him taken down as it

2754
02:41:23.880 --> 02:41:26.790
did.
But the one before is what started off that combination.

2755
02:41:26.791 --> 02:41:29.100
Raise clover hurt for sure.
You can't just do this.

2756
02:41:29.420 --> 02:41:33.550
He's going to roll this back and get out.
Louise too high.
He's got to stand up.

2757
02:41:34.540 --> 02:41:39.510
Stand up.
Stand up.
Cool.
Little critical moment here.
Right?

2758
02:41:40.030 --> 02:41:44.860
But man,
what you do here,
she's doing right now hand fighting stance.

2759
02:41:44.890 --> 02:41:48.840
Cause here's one hook in Stan and hand fight and he was trying to create that

2760
02:41:48.841 --> 02:41:53.760
opening.
Try and create that.
Ow.
Oh ow.
Oh,

2761
02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:57.770
oh shit.
He got up.
He's about to get taken down.

2762
02:41:57.771 --> 02:42:00.960
That was crucial cause he was like a movie,
right?
Yeah.
But I'll tell you what.

2763
02:42:00.961 --> 02:42:03.780
Orphans landed some fucking hard shots while he's trying to take him down

2764
02:42:03.781 --> 02:42:06.920
earlier.
They ain't no picnic standing up with him.
Fuck No.

2765
02:42:07.020 --> 02:42:10.890
You separate that left kick to the body and to the head.
Oh,
on the feet.

2766
02:42:10.920 --> 02:42:11.850
OSPS better.

2767
02:42:12.330 --> 02:42:16.510
I think he's dangerous as fuck cause fuzzing kicks.

2768
02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:18.840
All clover does is he's like a boxer.

2769
02:42:18.870 --> 02:42:21.570
He's like a really good rampage who can grapple is what I think.

2770
02:42:21.571 --> 02:42:24.960
Well it's also woven ties.
Those two big knockouts over shogun.
He's calming.

2771
02:42:25.180 --> 02:42:29.700
Take down.
Wrestling is ridiculous.
Tony.
It's so funny or good.

2772
02:42:30.450 --> 02:42:34.020
Ah,
he's a,
he's a beast.
Look it over.
It's looking for the fucking Paul Harris.

2773
02:42:34.021 --> 02:42:36.720
That's what we're going to call it from now on.
It's not the Camorra anymore.

2774
02:42:36.721 --> 02:42:39.320
It's the Paul Harris in the morning to recover too.

2775
02:42:40.230 --> 02:42:44.740
He is the amount of to write to mount.

2776
02:42:44.900 --> 02:42:49.160
Damn,
I'm Ken.
This is exhausting for over in saint pro super cost.

2777
02:42:49.161 --> 02:42:51.750
Especially if you're not a grappler.
We wind up in guard here.

2778
02:42:55.910 --> 02:43:00.030
Some serious ass up game where they say approve loves the Von Flowers.
Yeah,

2779
02:43:00.060 --> 02:43:04.770
he does to do it.
Yup.
It's over.

2780
02:43:04.830 --> 02:43:07.530
He might get the von flue here and we might go,
shit,

2781
02:43:11.230 --> 02:43:13.750
what was going out?
He's going,
he's going out.

2782
02:43:13.810 --> 02:43:16.510
It's sometimes sometimes the gloves duck.
No.
Globish smart.

2783
02:43:16.511 --> 02:43:18.700
He's turning away from it.
Wow.

2784
02:43:18.701 --> 02:43:23.310
This is close to the to do.
Those are two good grappler,

2785
02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:25.960
dude.
Look at this man.
He stuck.

2786
02:43:26.140 --> 02:43:29.320
I jumped into top half gold lock down and let the guy get on top of me and I

2787
02:43:29.321 --> 02:43:31.840
finished one of my back.
It's easier from the border.
You do.

2788
02:43:31.841 --> 02:43:34.030
Eddie had jumped in the top half.
They take it.

2789
02:43:34.031 --> 02:43:37.150
I locked down their legs in advance.
Let them roll on top of me.

2790
02:43:37.151 --> 02:43:38.980
And it's easier from the back with the lock that,

2791
02:43:38.981 --> 02:43:43.470
so this position right here on flu lockdown.
Yep.

2792
02:43:45.370 --> 02:43:49.480
Oh Man.
Proofs.
Kickers.

2793
02:43:50.100 --> 02:43:53.500
Kidding me.
Are you kidding me?
Kick please kick.
His kicks are awesome.

2794
02:43:53.520 --> 02:43:57.930
Oh look at that.
That's a bad idea.
That's a horrible idea against,

2795
02:43:57.970 --> 02:44:00.580
he's such an athlete,
like the way he moves.

2796
02:44:00.700 --> 02:44:03.340
He's got so much fucking horsepower behind him.
He does.

2797
02:44:03.550 --> 02:44:08.470
He does in his ass.
[inaudible] ass.
That's a Kim Kardashian ass.
Look at it.

2798
02:44:08.500 --> 02:44:13.170
Maybe after she goes to Brazil for critters.
Got To shit or on them for sure.
Hey,

2799
02:44:14.550 --> 02:44:17.800
critters kind of shit.
So No,
you mind.
Oh,

2800
02:44:17.801 --> 02:44:22.570
you did kind of a bitch.
Sorry.
I'm going to have to ask you to,

2801
02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:27.700
who is this?
Some dude who runs fast and now five signs.
He's an actor.

2802
02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:32.230
The MONTEL Williams.
Isn't it
some Zombie movie?

2803
02:44:32.231 --> 02:44:33.760
Is this the day of the dead or some shit?

2804
02:44:34.300 --> 02:44:37.600
Is this the new walking dead one or Montel Williams is not what this is.

2805
02:44:38.370 --> 02:44:42.910
You know there's a new walking dead.
Rose is he called it of the dead.
I Dunno.

2806
02:44:42.970 --> 02:44:45.010
Like switch it up though.
Well,

2807
02:44:45.011 --> 02:44:48.240
the idea is to keep it as close as possible because it's the same same writers

2808
02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:50.360
sit a walk and have like a chain of them.
Gotcha.

2809
02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:53.980
It's something super close like run of the dead or jog of the dead.

2810
02:44:54.010 --> 02:44:57.520
It's smart man,
because everybody who loves that show,
he can't get enough of it.

2811
02:44:57.521 --> 02:45:01.000
I can't get enough of that shit.
First two seasons.
Good walking daily.

2812
02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:05.110
I need a shell.
So fun.
I love it.
Let me ask you this though.
Rogan,

2813
02:45:05.290 --> 02:45:09.220
let me ask you this into here.
What the new one takes place here in la?
Yeah.

2814
02:45:09.250 --> 02:45:11.710
Well the old one took place in Atlanta.
There's no blacks,

2815
02:45:11.711 --> 02:45:14.320
zombies and walking dead.
It's in Atlanta,

2816
02:45:14.321 --> 02:45:16.770
so they pale up the pill up with little shit.

2817
02:45:16.780 --> 02:45:19.960
They do pay a lot of it Belloc ones actually,
but it would be,

2818
02:45:19.961 --> 02:45:21.990
there'd be a lot more dead.
Right?

2819
02:45:26.050 --> 02:45:28.330
Real problem.
That is a big strong man.

2820
02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:32.710
Get that Shit you played for Tennessee volunteers.
Is that kick to the body?

2821
02:45:32.711 --> 02:45:36.820
His kicks are nasty man.
Power behind them.
Ouch.

2822
02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:39.490
And he's another guy that just gets more and more efficient.

2823
02:45:39.491 --> 02:45:43.300
He loves that upper cut to,
he gets more and more fish off,
but by the way,

2824
02:45:43.301 --> 02:45:47.740
there is a hell of a box overs.
More technical intros.
Real short chest.

2825
02:45:47.770 --> 02:45:50.920
There's that first or second again,
kid,
you got a good point.

2826
02:45:50.921 --> 02:45:54.610
But look or events say no.
Back to his feet.
Come out of cardio.

2827
02:45:54.611 --> 02:45:58.570
Left's gonna come down to cardio cars or knock.

2828
02:45:59.450 --> 02:46:02.980
He's never been in dangerous rounds like championship Brown clover clover's

2829
02:46:02.981 --> 02:46:05.830
never been knocked out.
Right.
We'll go over,
starting to slow down or excuse me,

2830
02:46:05.831 --> 02:46:08.650
Osp.
Starting to slow down a little bit here and we're at four minutes.

2831
02:46:08.720 --> 02:46:13.410
She looked at the clock.
A lot of muscle feed,
oxygen,
muscle feed,
oxygen to,
well,

2832
02:46:13.411 --> 02:46:17.090
he's just body.
She's gotta be aware of what he's doing because he's exploding.

2833
02:46:17.091 --> 02:46:21.350
He's not as mechanical efficiency.
Better box.
He keeps looking better cock.

2834
02:46:21.380 --> 02:46:23.980
That's a bad sign,
man.
Well,
you know what?
Clovers,

2835
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:25.370
just wasting less time movement,

2836
02:46:25.371 --> 02:46:29.390
but the movement that Osp does so much pop behind it.

2837
02:46:29.630 --> 02:46:32.740
You can only do that for so long though.
No matter how athletic you are.
Yep.

2838
02:46:32.780 --> 02:46:36.960
That's again,
getting,
taking skin.
He's going for a run and clover,

2839
02:46:36.970 --> 02:46:41.780
so strong.
Same smile.
Smile.
He smiles is my son.
He's like,

2840
02:46:41.781 --> 02:46:45.950
I'm winning and you know what?
He's wearing his ass.
He's a better fighter.

2841
02:46:46.040 --> 02:46:48.290
Eddie Bravo.
Any brought you want to check the cash?

2842
02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:49.790
You want to check her calendar right now?

2843
02:46:50.150 --> 02:46:52.390
I'll give you 200 right now to get out of,

2844
02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:56.590
we call it 200 200 cash cash right now.

2845
02:46:57.270 --> 02:47:01.520
Take your
shit deal.
Take the money.

2846
02:47:02.170 --> 02:47:04.270
Sure he should wait a minute.
Come on in the fight.
Still gone.

2847
02:47:06.220 --> 02:47:09.900
Make the deal right now with cash,
money,
cash out.

2848
02:47:11.850 --> 02:47:14.990
Then he cut his losses and only time we ever really caught damage.

2849
02:47:14.991 --> 02:47:18.470
Control your own foot off,
but you still got your life.
Well,

2850
02:47:18.471 --> 02:47:20.780
you don't want to get fuck cardio.
Fight with OSP.

2851
02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:24.350
He's not going to win that one being that explosive.
Yeah,
I didn't look good.

2852
02:47:24.351 --> 02:47:28.200
It's the second round.
It doesn't look good.
So I got,
I think I made out.
Yeah,

2853
02:47:28.220 --> 02:47:32.780
you're just can kind of chillax down here and take a little break Ipu and just

2854
02:47:32.781 --> 02:47:37.190
defend himself.
Well telling you when you're eating elbows.
That's true.

2855
02:47:37.390 --> 02:47:41.970
To share our elbows.
It's very tough to do.
You know what?

2856
02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:48.830
Just
come back later.
Let's,

2857
02:47:48.831 --> 02:47:52.720
uh,
let's go back your,

2858
02:47:54.290 --> 02:47:54.741
how about this?

2859
02:47:54.741 --> 02:47:57.200
How about you make an alternative bet since you're going to let him out,

2860
02:47:58.820 --> 02:48:01.850
$73.
How about you?
How about you bet,

2861
02:48:01.851 --> 02:48:06.560
whether or not OSP makes it past five is he getting make it past the fifth?
No,

2862
02:48:06.561 --> 02:48:08.900
I'm just going to get finished.
He's going to get say right now,

2863
02:48:08.901 --> 02:48:12.800
not a shy double or nothing and got a shot at not a shot.
He goes back.

2864
02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:15.470
I'll take anybody's bad shot.
He laughs too.

2865
02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:17.270
I'll bet at two grade he doesn't make it.

2866
02:48:17.330 --> 02:48:20.480
I say it doesn't last till around three he just is too type much.

2867
02:48:20.481 --> 02:48:25.100
Do you want to bet and we can,
we can then and go back to the original one.

2868
02:48:25.101 --> 02:48:29.600
If I feel,
oh he's coming back.
You have a right to refusal,

2869
02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:34.430
but I'm going to give you the option.
We'll just,
we'll just add it to the next.

2870
02:48:34.830 --> 02:48:39.620
It's coming back.
I'll go.
We we and all this shit.
I will see go back,

2871
02:48:40.100 --> 02:48:44.450
but right now we're good.
I think.
I think Osp,

2872
02:48:44.550 --> 02:48:49.160
a Tko a third round gets Tko.
Okay,

2873
02:48:49.161 --> 02:48:52.710
Brian,
is that what you think too?
Fuck.
Yeah.
Who wants to know?

2874
02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:55.620
Wants to give me a good bet that it goes the full five shot.

2875
02:48:55.710 --> 02:48:58.820
I bet you anything wrong really?
Can you give me 10 to one?

2876
02:48:59.360 --> 02:49:02.400
I sometimes fights 10 to one.
All right.

2877
02:49:02.450 --> 02:49:06.260
10 to $100 oh no.
I don't want to bet that much.

2878
02:49:06.380 --> 02:49:09.290
A hundred dollar dollar two and 10 I'm looking to maximize,

2879
02:49:09.300 --> 02:49:10.830
but front's gone for an electric chair

2880
02:49:12.970 --> 02:49:17.970
of Veggie tend to win a hundred.
I'm not taking the money anyway,

2881
02:49:17.971 --> 02:49:20.160
but Glover's beating his ass though.
That's for fuck shore.

2882
02:49:20.820 --> 02:49:22.170
He's hitting them with some serious ground.

2883
02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:27.130
I'm always cutting them up with that elbow
is not making it.
No.

2884
02:49:27.310 --> 02:49:31.500
30 minutes over.
This is the glow over the beat.
Ryan Bader,

2885
02:49:31.501 --> 02:49:34.680
this is the glow over that was making his run at the title.
He's a beast.

2886
02:49:34.890 --> 02:49:36.660
People slept on him a little bit in this fight.

2887
02:49:36.690 --> 02:49:41.360
His grappling fees getting over in saint proves the underdog.
It was Friday,

2888
02:49:41.361 --> 02:49:45.180
correct?
No,
he's the favorite.
Oh my God.
Well,

2889
02:49:46.770 --> 02:49:49.410
I would've thought there'd be even money.
Quite honest.
It was almost even.

2890
02:49:49.411 --> 02:49:54.330
It was like plus one oh five
mm.
No,
no,
no,

2891
02:49:54.331 --> 02:49:57.510
no.
He's gonna get taken down easy and get his ass.

2892
02:49:58.340 --> 02:50:01.990
He's so tired.
They're both so tired.
You know,
like Glover said,
he said,
uh,

2893
02:50:02.020 --> 02:50:03.510
in the Phil Davis fight in Brazil.

2894
02:50:03.511 --> 02:50:05.880
He just didn't cut the weight right and he was exhausted.

2895
02:50:05.881 --> 02:50:09.510
So he just got fucking grappled for five rounds was also a lot of people felt

2896
02:50:09.511 --> 02:50:11.690
like,
you know,
he didn't go to American top team for that fight.

2897
02:50:11.691 --> 02:50:16.190
He stayed in Connecticut and train in his garage.
He did too.

2898
02:50:16.210 --> 02:50:20.010
I thought that kick back.
Oh.
Oh Shit.

2899
02:50:20.820 --> 02:50:25.620
Oh Shit.
Clovers.
Tired as fuck.
Oh Shit.
Oh Shit.
Son.

2900
02:50:27.910 --> 02:50:32.570
Want to go back
back?

2901
02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:40.810
Thank God Eddie Bravo didn't pay out back.
We're fighting back.
I'm eating.

2902
02:50:41.640 --> 02:50:43.230
You know what?
We're back.

2903
02:50:43.500 --> 02:50:46.660
I lost faith and I must shamed of that boy.

2904
02:50:47.340 --> 02:50:50.880
I am ashamed when you lose,
you look into my eyes and I give it back to you.

2905
02:50:50.881 --> 02:50:52.830
Look at my eyes.
I give you strap ashamed of that,

2906
02:50:53.070 --> 02:50:57.060
but I feel now he's coming back and he's going to take this and you're gonna to

2907
02:50:57.070 --> 02:51:00.870
me mind after seeing that and explain to you both,
you got one complaint.

2908
02:51:00.900 --> 02:51:04.230
Is there any way we can get more Ronda Rousey ads?
This is ridiculous.

2909
02:51:05.700 --> 02:51:10.080
Famous though.
A little mud.

2910
02:51:10.110 --> 02:51:14.670
She's a two guys that can handle her.
Two guys,

2911
02:51:14.980 --> 02:51:16.980
thorn soldiers,
Demetrius Johnson,

2912
02:51:20.190 --> 02:51:23.910
Demetrius Johnson,
Captain America,
the thing.
And Conor Mcgregor,

2913
02:51:24.070 --> 02:51:25.880
I [inaudible] handle it.

2914
02:51:27.630 --> 02:51:31.900
She would eat him alive.
I could,
yes,

2915
02:51:32.610 --> 02:51:36.390
I could.
Cause your superfund was,
she would hate,
no,

2916
02:51:36.391 --> 02:51:39.570
I would have sex with her a lot.
I haven't had sex with her a lot and,

2917
02:51:39.571 --> 02:51:42.440
and I break her walls down and I'd be super nice to her and make a lot.

2918
02:51:42.441 --> 02:51:43.274
It's watch his fight.

2919
02:51:44.280 --> 02:51:48.060
Hang on half and half tax from his left kick of tries or with my peace.

2920
02:51:48.710 --> 02:51:53.310
Quick goals to the,
we go,
here we go.
By the way,

2921
02:51:53.311 --> 02:51:56.600
open say true might just pull this out dude.
He could pull it out.

2922
02:51:56.610 --> 02:52:01.410
He's exhausted to take it.
That it can come back from being exhausted.

2923
02:52:02.440 --> 02:52:06.070
He's not,
he could recover.
Recover,
no to do recovery.
He's

2924
02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:10.270
<v 0>still,
he's hurt Goldberg Glover just hurt him.
Who has to run.</v>

2925
02:52:10.271 --> 02:52:13.680
He has to do a lot of running cause he needs to get off the fucking day.

2926
02:52:13.681 --> 02:52:16.480
Faints or beautiful Glover's footwork and his faints.

2927
02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:20.350
He stank just far enough that he knows like what opens can do right now.

2928
02:52:20.530 --> 02:52:21.610
That's a nice idea.

2929
02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:24.220
He knows like the amount of spring he's got left at his staff,

2930
02:52:24.221 --> 02:52:27.460
he's calculating it.
Well look,
he's going to take them down again.

2931
02:52:27.850 --> 02:52:31.450
It's going to pop his hips to lift him up or trap is going to scoop him right in

2932
02:52:31.451 --> 02:52:36.160
the fucking air.
This who's going to do boom,
oh Vince,
time to carry some weight.

2933
02:52:36.870 --> 02:52:40.710
He didn't get finished this round.
Four minutes or some way.
Eddie,
do you,

2934
02:52:40.780 --> 02:52:43.360
would you like to get to that?
I mean that he's going to have be on the ground.

2935
02:52:43.490 --> 02:52:46.670
He's,
he's going to wear him.
He's too tired to get these.

2936
02:52:47.260 --> 02:52:52.240
Think he's too tired.
It doesn't go past third round.
I think he can still get up,

2937
02:52:52.241 --> 02:52:55.450
man.
I'm not under going to get it in this guy.
This kids got mad heart.

2938
02:52:56.080 --> 02:52:59.200
I think [inaudible] is a tough fucking dude.
I think he finishes them this round.

2939
02:52:59.290 --> 02:53:03.340
I think he's not as mechanically efficient as he can be in the future because he

2940
02:53:03.341 --> 02:53:08.200
explode so much in everything.
But I think that's also a strength training wrong.

2941
02:53:08.690 --> 02:53:11.260
I'm also his strength.
He should some boxers and run.

2942
02:53:11.710 --> 02:53:14.650
Maybe that would help for sure.
But it's also something that he does to people.

2943
02:53:14.651 --> 02:53:18.480
They don't expect the amount of explosion that he jumps into that success with.

2944
02:53:18.490 --> 02:53:21.250
Yeah.
I've worked with Matt only to a certain level.

2945
02:53:21.430 --> 02:53:24.010
And then when you fight a vet,
a true vet who has seen that,

2946
02:53:24.011 --> 02:53:26.350
you don't think Glover seen the explosive guy before,
what,

2947
02:53:26.351 --> 02:53:27.340
you know what the deal is?

2948
02:53:27.340 --> 02:53:31.720
He's got to be able to do both and got to know when to do in Schwatz.
Yes,
yes.

2949
02:53:31.721 --> 02:53:33.280
You gotta know when to do it and do each one,

2950
02:53:33.430 --> 02:53:38.430
but I think right now he's not quite as technically proficient as like a guy

2951
02:53:38.501 --> 02:53:42.760
like Glover where Glover throws short combinations and they're snowshoes and

2952
02:53:42.761 --> 02:53:46.450
efficient.
Yeah.
I think,
oh,
Vince hasn't like reached that level yet,
but oh,

2953
02:53:46.460 --> 02:53:50.770
Vince can hit fucking hard.
He's keeps working for that mounts.
Look at that.

2954
02:53:50.790 --> 02:53:55.330
That's going to get finished here.
Ah,
look up,
look down.
Look at this shit.

2955
02:53:55.331 --> 02:53:57.930
Look at that.
Look at how you earn your money.
Good control man.

2956
02:53:57.950 --> 02:54:02.290
Glover's cannot turn out.
That mount is so nasty.

2957
02:54:03.340 --> 02:54:06.370
I remember money by fame.
Dick jumped on the fire and the kid got bad brother.

2958
02:54:06.580 --> 02:54:10.480
Once he,
once he got on top of cow Kingsburg really see that mountain.
I was like,

2959
02:54:10.510 --> 02:54:12.550
Ooh,
that's a scary ass fucking mount.

2960
02:54:14.400 --> 02:54:17.920
He's strong as shit too man.
You know the other thing about Ose,
super strong.

2961
02:54:17.950 --> 02:54:20.650
The other thing about Osb,
if he didn't train at a high level camp,

2962
02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:24.490
which they train,
he trains in Tennessee at this.
Oh my God,

2963
02:54:24.550 --> 02:54:27.760
he don't have like a lot of high class training gets fucked up dude.

2964
02:54:27.761 --> 02:54:29.410
He's got fucked up.
He didn't get finished.

2965
02:54:29.950 --> 02:54:33.490
Can I tell you and Eddie Bravo.

2966
02:54:33.491 --> 02:54:36.180
Gimme my 500 he's going to Tash.

2967
02:54:37.860 --> 02:54:38.280
<v 4>Yeah,
that's</v>

2968
02:54:38.280 --> 02:54:39.230
<v 0>done.
That's too deep.</v>

2969
02:54:40.620 --> 02:54:45.620
And he's gone to sleep and and let's he's out.

2970
02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:50.680
He's out.
He went out.
Wow.
Eddie,
I'm sorry to say thank you.

2971
02:54:50.710 --> 02:54:53.550
With respect to Osp,

2972
02:54:53.760 --> 02:54:57.730
he was thinking about tapping and to Matt decided I'm not to shop.

2973
02:54:57.810 --> 02:55:02.220
He went out map and look at how awesome lover over,

2974
02:55:02.390 --> 02:55:05.400
A great called killer.
Nice guy.
Got a fucking great guy.

2975
02:55:05.740 --> 02:55:09.620
What a a crazy moment that is.
When a fighter decides not to tap,

2976
02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:12.650
it's pretty gangster.
Fuck.
Sometimes they don't know though.

2977
02:55:12.710 --> 02:55:16.970
You think you're like,

I'm going to them.
Yeah,

It's true.

2978
02:55:17.900 --> 02:55:21.170
It's true.
You're like,
I'm going to find the house.
Look at this.

2979
02:55:21.171 --> 02:55:22.690
Look at this combination.
Mitch,

Bro.

2981
02:55:26.290 --> 02:55:28.160
Look at this fucking right here man.

2982
02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:30.820
And then watch when he cinches it up onto the bicep.
Look,

2983
02:55:30.890 --> 02:55:32.600
why wouldn't you tap Lee's name and fighting?

2984
02:55:32.850 --> 02:55:37.850
He's trying to fight the one hand he has got that squeeze on it and that's how

2985
02:55:37.900 --> 02:55:42.380
it is.
So awesome.
I like my car so fucking awesome.
I love that guy.

2986
02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:46.010
He's the best legit Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt too.

2987
02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:49.610
He knows exactly what's going on in there.

2988

We're so lucky.
That's,

3021
02:57:46.221 --> 02:57:49.350
I think one of the most important things in life is having cool friends and

3022
02:57:49.351 --> 02:57:52.820
their friends' friends.
I drove to the comedy store yesterday.

3023
02:57:53.060 --> 02:57:56.210
I had no other reason.
I said,
maybe Joe's there.
I see you right in the park.

3024
02:57:56.211 --> 02:57:58.590
And I got out and we hang out for two hours just talking about it.

3025
02:57:59.360 --> 02:58:02.010
They always say the coolest shit.
It's a shit you don't expect the

3026
02:58:02.010 --> 02:58:04.950
<v 1>shit you didn't plan for.
And like this crew,</v>

3027
02:58:05.130 --> 02:58:07.150
we didn't plan this shit and it's kind of just happened.

3028
02:58:07.800 --> 02:58:09.500
We'll find a fucking a night.
You know what I mean?
