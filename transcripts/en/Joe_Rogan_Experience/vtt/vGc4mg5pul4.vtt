1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.830
<v Speaker 1>so why aren't there flying cars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just jumping right in.</v>

3
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.040
<v Speaker 1>You don't say hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't say how I you ready?</v>

4
00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:16.930
<v Speaker 1>How's the wife and kids buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

5
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 1>how's life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's your book?</v>

6
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.150
<v Speaker 1>It's been on the times bestseller list </v>
<v Speaker 1>for how many weeks?</v>

7
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the astrophysics for people in a hurry.</v>

8
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.740
<v Speaker 1>That's one on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the New York Times best.</v>

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.190
<v Speaker 1>It was for 67 weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty intense.</v>

10
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.320
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot for any book.</v>

11
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:33.183
<v Speaker 1>Much less for a science book and so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells me while all these trump books or </v>

12
00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:39.760
<v Speaker 1>wafting in and out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is bobbing like a court,</v>

13
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.653
<v Speaker 1>like a cork on the ocean waves as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book of the moment that they're either </v>

14
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.923
<v Speaker 1>praises trump or criticized or </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizes him come in and off of that </v>

15
00:00:49.151 --> 00:00:49.984
<v Speaker 1>list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this tells me that there is this </v>

16
00:00:52.211 --> 00:00:57.130
<v Speaker 1>unserved hunger that people have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a curiosity that this is serving</v>

17
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.960
<v Speaker 1>and it's to astrophysics for people in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurry.</v>

18
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.350
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very purposefully juxtaposed.</v>

19
00:01:05.351 --> 00:01:08.260
<v Speaker 1>It's like neurosurgery in four easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>steps.</v>

20
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you saw a book with that title,</v>

21
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.900
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to pick it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wonder what's going on,</v>

22
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.063
<v Speaker 1>not to kiss your ass again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I always say this about you and I </v>

23
00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:17.764
<v Speaker 1>think it's important you make learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff about astrophysics fun and that's </v>

24
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:24.200
<v Speaker 1>what's missing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

25
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.660
<v Speaker 1>it's not that people don't like to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>educated that they don't like to learn.</v>

26
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>They just don't want to be bored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a perceptive point because,</v>

27
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of the image we have of.</v>

28
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you're in a school where most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't go to college.</v>

29
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.340
<v Speaker 1>You're in high school and then last day </v>
<v Speaker 1>of school comes.</v>

30
00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:43.174
<v Speaker 1>What do people do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tossed their papers in the air as </v>

31
00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:47.320
<v Speaker 1>they run down the steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schools out.</v>

32
00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's the rock song?</v>

33
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.510
<v Speaker 1>School fall summit.</v>

34
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Was it forever?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever.</v>

35
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.053
<v Speaker 1>Forever ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that attitude must mean the school </v>

36
00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:59.643
<v Speaker 1>didn't train you to embrace curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That learning was a chore and now the </v>

37
00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:06.904
<v Speaker 1>Chores are over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the educational system needs </v>

38
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:10.504
<v Speaker 1>an adjustment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget whether or not you go to college </v>

39
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:15.550
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to spend more years</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in school than in school.</v>

40
00:02:15.551 --> 00:02:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Even if you do go to college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want,</v>

41
00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I think are lifelong learners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifelong curiosity,</v>

42
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.410
<v Speaker 1>where once you are trained and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

43
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.283
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your curiosity is stimulated the </v>

44
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.510
<v Speaker 1>curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all had his children.</v>

45
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Your children don't need to be taught to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be curious.</v>

46
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.463
<v Speaker 1>They are curious to the point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction of whatever it is they </v>

47
00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:36.131
<v Speaker 1>touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

48
00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:38.920
<v Speaker 1>what is this egg on the counter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this glass?</v>

49
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.380
<v Speaker 1>What is this plate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's under a rock?</v>

50
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.700
<v Speaker 1>What happens when I pull a leg off a </v>
<v Speaker 1>daddy long legs?</v>

51
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 1>You know they are experimenting with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

52
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:48.910
<v Speaker 1>We don't think of it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it is.</v>

53
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.030
<v Speaker 1>They're all born scientists and I say </v>
<v Speaker 1>this often,</v>

54
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.750
<v Speaker 1>you spend the first years of a child's </v>
<v Speaker 1>life teaching it to walk and talk.</v>

55
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Then he spent the rest of his life tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to shut up and sit down.</v>

56
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.090
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>

57
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 2>this is the wrong combination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So speaking as an educator,</v>

58
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:08.881
<v Speaker 2>I think a missing component of school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it the teachers?</v>

59
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 2>Is that the curriculum?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

60
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 2>but when you get out of school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should say to yourself,</v>

61
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to learn more.</v>

62
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 2>It's almost universally accepted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

63
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 2>That's when you're learning ends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get out of college,</v>

64
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:19.714
<v Speaker 2>it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you say you're done and if it </v>

65
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.334
<v Speaker 2>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're ossified in line and that's how </v>

66
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.823
<v Speaker 2>when the job market shifts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not ready for it because you </v>

67
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how to learn and it's the</v>

68
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:30.094
<v Speaker 2>difference in the in the workplace </v>
<v Speaker 2>between the person who gets an </v>

69
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:33.780
<v Speaker 2>assignment because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

70
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey,</v>

71
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Janet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need you to do this.</v>

72
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 2>That's not in my job description.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trained for this.</v>

73
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 2>That's one kind of person in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>workplace.</v>

74
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Another kind of person is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a new task I need you to do.</v>

75
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen that before.</v>

76
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me figure it out.</v>

77
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.123
<v Speaker 2>These are two completely different </v>
<v Speaker 2>species of human being and what the </v>

78
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:55.834
<v Speaker 2>world needs more of is like the second </v>
<v Speaker 2>case where you take a new task and you </v>

79
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:00.874
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

80
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 2>I get to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to learn on my own.</v>

81
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:04.890
<v Speaker 2>I'll ask people who know more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

82
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.813
<v Speaker 2>you just embrace the act of learning to </v>
<v Speaker 2>satisfy your curiosity and I think this </v>

83
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 2>book is capturing that in the public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

84
00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:14.250
<v Speaker 2>it must be doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

85
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty.</v>

86
00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:16.900
<v Speaker 2>How many weeks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty seven weeks.</v>

87
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of weeks.</v>

88
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every morning I wake up,</v>

89
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm calm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm really not calm.</v>

90
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>

91
00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're alive.</v>

92
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:27.080
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I say,</v>

93
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can say it.</v>

94
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.520
<v Speaker 2>Tyson swears ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people think you're a robot.</v>

95
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Now they know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

96
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 2>this is great sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

97
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 2>and I think your podcast is a great sign</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>

98
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.660
<v Speaker 2>the success of your podcast and success </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a lot of science podcasts.</v>

99
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:43.643
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

100
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.543
<v Speaker 2>that's an excellent that you noticed </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a rise of science curious </v>

101
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.054
<v Speaker 2>podcast out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stuff to blow your mind is one that I </v>

102
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 2>really enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really love radio lab.</v>

103
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.273
<v Speaker 2>They've always got elaborately </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting science of annual perennial </v>

104
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:57.111
<v Speaker 2>favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fantastic.</v>

105
00:04:57.111 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 2>So many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably the best,</v>

106
00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

107
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yours as well and I love chuck.</v>

108
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:02.170
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shout out to chuck.</v>

109
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.223
<v Speaker 2>Chuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chuck.</v>

110
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 2>Chuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's great.</v>

111
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 2>But what you're doing is you're making </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning interesting and that's why it's</v>

112
00:05:08.711 --> 00:05:10.130
<v Speaker 2>so fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

113
00:05:10.131 --> 00:05:10.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

114
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.700
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's excitement to it,</v>

115
00:05:12.701 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 2>and you bring a comedian like chuck on </v>
<v Speaker 2>with you.</v>

116
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.023
<v Speaker 2>Things get silly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're also curious and you're </v>

117
00:05:18.371 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 2>getting these experts and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about these various subjects.</v>

118
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:22.834
<v Speaker 2>And as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only yourself as an exemplar of </v>

119
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:26.674
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a standup comedians are some of the </v>

120
00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:31.010
<v Speaker 2>smartest people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have that.</v>

121
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.800
<v Speaker 2>They have an awareness of that far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

122
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.890
<v Speaker 2>come to the comedy store with me to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>upstage your mind.</v>

123
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.340
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me buffer that a serious.</v>

124
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

125
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.090
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so stand up.</v>

126
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:44.890
<v Speaker 2>Comedians are perceptive people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

127
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.440
<v Speaker 2>And for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're aware and they notice things</v>

128
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:48.274
<v Speaker 2>that you don't notice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They see the same things you do and get </v>

129
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:53.380
<v Speaker 2>to shape it in a way you never thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

130
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.290
<v Speaker 2>And then you end up laughing at other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things at yourself.</v>

131
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Was it your idea</v>

132
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.550
<v Speaker 1>to do your show with standups?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

133
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.960
<v Speaker 1>So to what we have there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

134
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 1>there were several of us who created </v>
<v Speaker 1>this concept and we,</v>

135
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.003
<v Speaker 1>there's a Helen Matzos is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>partners and there's another one who's </v>

136
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.620
<v Speaker 1>now left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

137
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's his name in a minute,</v>

138
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 1>but there are three of us who David </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gamble is his name.</v>

139
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>The three of us got together and applied</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a national science foundation grant.</v>

140
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 1>What we said was there are programs out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that serve people who already know</v>

141
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 1>they like science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who serves the people who don't know</v>

142
00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:34.760
<v Speaker 1>they like science or better yet the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who know they don't like science.</v>

143
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing for them because they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>already rejected it.</v>

144
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.073
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to tune in to science </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday because they don't like science </v>

145
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.800
<v Speaker 1>on NPR.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

146
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 1>So what we thought was supposed we bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a celebrity,</v>

147
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.120
<v Speaker 1>we've all the pop culture draw.</v>

148
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.283
<v Speaker 1>This is the pop culture scaffold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We bring in the scaffold and clad the </v>

149
00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:58.670
<v Speaker 1>scaffold with science because whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>the celebrity does,</v>

150
00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.533
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be science in that </v>

151
00:07:00.921 --> 00:07:01.754
<v Speaker 1>person's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had the guy who portrayed Gollum in </v>

152
00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.493
<v Speaker 1>Lord of the Rings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of Sockeye that suit that he had </v>

153
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 1>to wear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

154
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:14.650
<v Speaker 1>So what we did was we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

155
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so with the interview and we,</v>

156
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.880
<v Speaker 1>we talked about the technology necessary</v>
<v Speaker 1>to portray Gollum as a light.</v>

157
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.120
<v Speaker 1>He portrayed that live that was not some</v>
<v Speaker 1>law later animation.</v>

158
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.193
<v Speaker 1>He is live and he's got his whole body </v>
<v Speaker 1>wired up for this and he is that voice </v>

159
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:33.070
<v Speaker 1>and he is portraying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

160
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.110
<v Speaker 1>so whatever it is that you have done </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do,</v>

161
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.710
<v Speaker 1>there is some because it's evidence that</v>
<v Speaker 1>science is everywhere.</v>

162
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.360
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't say,</v>

163
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with science,</v>

164
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:43.274
<v Speaker 1>let me sell my textbook and move onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things because practically </v>

165
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:48.500
<v Speaker 1>anything else you do has been touched by</v>
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

166
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.350
<v Speaker 1>And so startalk is a celebration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

167
00:07:51.351 --> 00:07:54.380
<v Speaker 1>And then it jumps species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now we're on TV now.</v>

168
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.553
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a TV show on national geographic </v>

169
00:07:57.051 --> 00:07:58.310
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start Talk.</v>

170
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.970
<v Speaker 1>And then since you started this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

171
00:08:00.971 --> 00:08:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

172
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.990
<v Speaker 1>I didn't come here and talk about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You started this.</v>

173
00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

174
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.893
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's our fourth year in a row where </v>

175
00:08:05.891 --> 00:08:09.560
<v Speaker 1>we're nominated for an emmy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>outstanding informational programming.</v>

176
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to keep doing cosmos too </v>
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>

177
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Because they'll cosmos so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

178
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.120
<v Speaker 1>So I have one week remaining out of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 shoot days to finish shooting cosmos.</v>

179
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Possible worlds premiering spring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2019 is the third installment of Cosmos.</v>

180
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.070
<v Speaker 1>If you trace the first one to Carl Sagan</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in 1980,</v>

181
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.280
<v Speaker 1>can I use your segment on wolves on how </v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves became dogs?</v>

182
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showed it to my kids.</v>

183
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.610
<v Speaker 1>And that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the little wheel spin and like,</v>

184
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:42.490
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

185
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.180
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how a dog became a dog or did you</v>

186
00:08:45.181 --> 00:08:46.014
<v Speaker 1>didn't see as I'm sitting at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the campfire and this snowy </v>

187
00:08:49.011 --> 00:08:50.960
<v Speaker 1>environment and they got wolves walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around me.</v>

188
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:56.260
<v Speaker 1>They're on these fishing wires because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are not dogs.</v>

189
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

190
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.510
<v Speaker 2>they do whatever the fuck they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

191
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.760
<v Speaker 2>And when they look at you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

192
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.673
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should I rip his neck out now or later </v>

193
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Speaker 2>when I'm more hungry?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did Not.</v>

194
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 2>There's no eye contact with them because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they you don't,</v>

195
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 2>that they don't see you as anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>other than something that could possibly</v>

196
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 2>eat and so you can't interact with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you would with ordinary dogs.</v>

197
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 2>So they're on these fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

198
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.400
<v Speaker 2>high tension fishing wire that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>see against the snow.</v>

199
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.593
<v Speaker 2>And they were like hooting and hollering</v>
<v Speaker 2>around me as I described in the name of </v>

200
00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Speaker 2>that show is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the wolf shall become the shepherd.</v>

201
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.003
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend did a commercial with a wolf </v>

202
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.013
<v Speaker 2>and A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this commercial where he's </v>

203
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:36.024
<v Speaker 2>running up this mountain and the wolf is</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and at the end of the commercial </v>

204
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.470
<v Speaker 2>they had to get the wolf to snarl.</v>

205
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:41.603
<v Speaker 2>So what the trainer does is he shows the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wolf some meat and then he pulls the </v>

206
00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:49.560
<v Speaker 2>meat away from the wolf and the wolf </v>
<v Speaker 2>snarls and they're like.</v>

207
00:09:49.561 --> 00:09:51.600
<v Speaker 2>And then the commercials over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

208
00:09:51.601 --> 00:09:52.191
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

209
00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:55.240
<v Speaker 2>is no working after that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>

210
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.040
<v Speaker 2>You can not going to be near the wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That switch is turned on.</v>

211
00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 2>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

212
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.370
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

213
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:02.820
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once that thing snarled,</v>

214
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.550
<v Speaker 2>everybody just backed off and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trainer let everybody know,</v>

215
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:07.920
<v Speaker 2>like once I get to this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're done.</v>

216
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no more and that things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

217
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.560
<v Speaker 2>okay everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're done.</v>

218
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.193
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All three of these cosmos is the </v>

219
00:10:18.871 --> 00:10:20.820
<v Speaker 2>original one with Carl Sagan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that,</v>

220
00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.910
<v Speaker 2>the privilege of hosting in 2014 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>2019.</v>

221
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.240
<v Speaker 2>Our Co written by Andrew [inaudible] and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's the widow of Carl Sagan.</v>

222
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:30.643
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

223
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.673
<v Speaker 2>but she kind of in his shadow back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's hugely creative and highly </v>

224
00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:39.430
<v Speaker 2>enlightened and so most of the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

225
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.340
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

226
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.300
<v Speaker 2>the soul energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will.</v>

227
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.390
<v Speaker 2>The what makes cosmos distinct from </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

228
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.870
<v Speaker 2>from other documentaries where you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of sitting there learning,</v>

229
00:10:48.871 --> 00:10:52.830
<v Speaker 2>you put your thinking cap on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>learning cap on in cosmos.</v>

230
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.530
<v Speaker 2>It's your feeling cap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not only learning,</v>

231
00:10:55.531 --> 00:11:00.531
<v Speaker 2>you're also feeling the science and its </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship to you to civilization,</v>

232
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.330
<v Speaker 2>to the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the universe.</v>

233
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:04.583
<v Speaker 2>And her infusion of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a highly scientifically literate </v>

234
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.650
<v Speaker 2>writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>producer.</v>

235
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:11.873
<v Speaker 2>And so I just give a shout out to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just working with her has been a </v>

236
00:11:14.551 --> 00:11:18.000
<v Speaker 2>delight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Cosmos on Apple TV or cosmos?</v>

237
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.823
<v Speaker 2>Cosmos was a after it first after it </v>
<v Speaker 2>premiered on Fox and then went </v>

238
00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:27.000
<v Speaker 2>internationally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Annette Geo it then went to Netflix.</v>

239
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:30.050
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think this run of Netflix is going</v>

240
00:11:30.051 --> 00:11:34.530
<v Speaker 2>to drop until the next one comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they want to clear the clear,</v>

241
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 2>the landing zone for the next cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it went to Netflix,</v>

242
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:40.290
<v Speaker 2>but is it available for anyone to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now?</v>

243
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now I should be.</v>

244
00:11:42.511 --> 00:11:44.100
<v Speaker 2>I haven't checked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a great question.</v>

245
00:11:44.101 --> 00:11:46.380
<v Speaker 2>I have it all on my dvr and I'm scared </v>
<v Speaker 2>to delete it.</v>

246
00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have like six percent less space.</v>

247
00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.530
<v Speaker 2>That's what everyone's Dvr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks like.</v>

248
00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.820
<v Speaker 2>I got all your cosmos is in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

249
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 2>So thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for having.</v>

250
00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Having them all in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that Morgan Freeman show?</v>

251
00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:00.150
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the through the,</v>

252
00:12:00.151 --> 00:12:01.460
<v Speaker 2>through the warm warm hall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

253
00:12:01.461 --> 00:12:02.700
<v Speaker 2>I got that on there too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

254
00:12:02.701 --> 00:12:05.290
<v Speaker 2>that was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Joe Rogan thing.</v>

255
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't have that,</v>

256
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:09.190
<v Speaker 2>I'd be disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I say you're an imposter,</v>

257
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:10.800
<v Speaker 2>you're a fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

258
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.510
<v Speaker 2>it's an opportunity to be entertained </v>
<v Speaker 2>and learn,</v>

259
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.373
<v Speaker 2>which I think is what everybody misses </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's what's missing in </v>

260
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:23.350
<v Speaker 2>most public education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are bored and you take these kids</v>

261
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:24.184
<v Speaker 2>with so much energy and then you make </v>
<v Speaker 2>them sit still and watch something </v>

262
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:27.214
<v Speaker 2>that's not even remotely stimulating by </v>
<v Speaker 2>a person who doesn't really care to be </v>

263
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:29.800
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

264
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.633
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they know,</v>

265
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.060
<v Speaker 2>they know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know this intuitively,</v>

266
00:12:34.061 --> 00:12:37.450
<v Speaker 2>if not explicitly that the enthusiasm is</v>
<v Speaker 2>absent.</v>

267
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.613
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could feel it and just it's the </v>

268
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:42.094
<v Speaker 2>worst way to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the worst way and it's so hard to </v>

269
00:12:44.651 --> 00:12:46.360
<v Speaker 2>escape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you get out of that system,</v>

270
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.373
<v Speaker 2>it takes forever for a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to just get their excitement </v>

271
00:12:51.041 --> 00:12:53.110
<v Speaker 2>about education back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I say?</v>

272
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:54.970
<v Speaker 2>When I address teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all,</v>

273
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.210
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do this right now in this room that</v>

274
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.010
<v Speaker 2>we have only three of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's.</v>

275
00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a show of hands in your life </v>
<v Speaker 2>with all the teachers you've ever had in</v>

276
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:04.384
<v Speaker 2>every class you've ever taken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many had like a singular influence </v>

277
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.400
<v Speaker 2>on who and what you became?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give me a number.</v>

278
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:16.900
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm betting it's five or fewer.</v>

279
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.850
<v Speaker 2>Probably more like three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

280
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:20.140
<v Speaker 2>for teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your number?</v>

281
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.213
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the one that I talked about on </v>

282
00:13:24.281 --> 00:13:25.114
<v Speaker 2>your show the last time I saw you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for coming on to start talking </v>

283
00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:28.320
<v Speaker 2>about pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

284
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.930
<v Speaker 2>who was a science teacher that I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I believe I was in seventh grade.</v>

285
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.833
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Told me that if you really want to hurt </v>

286
00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:37.750
<v Speaker 2>your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look up and recognize the fact that that</v>

287
00:13:37.751 --> 00:13:39.970
<v Speaker 2>goes on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That this is infinite.</v>

288
00:13:39.971 --> 00:13:42.850
<v Speaker 2>And then just think about what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

289
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.010
<v Speaker 2>Infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That there really is no end to it.</v>

290
00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.733
<v Speaker 2>So how many teachers such as that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>so influential on you that one guy </v>

291
00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:52.570
<v Speaker 2>saying that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you missed one class,</v>

292
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:56.450
<v Speaker 2>he might be the one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do you got to?</v>

293
00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:01.900
<v Speaker 2>For me it's like two and a half and I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>had scores of teachers,</v>

294
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:03.603
<v Speaker 2>100 teachers at least.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I tell teachers is be that </v>

295
00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:08.920
<v Speaker 2>teacher to your students.</v>

296
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.720
<v Speaker 2>We've all had those teachers be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher.</v>

297
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.190
<v Speaker 2>And in every case it wasn't because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>topic was something you knew in advance,</v>

298
00:14:15.191 --> 00:14:16.024
<v Speaker 2>you would like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because their energy for sharing </v>

299
00:14:19.301 --> 00:14:20.134
<v Speaker 2>their passion and love for the subject </v>
<v Speaker 2>was palpable and it just spilled out of </v>

300
00:14:23.411 --> 00:14:27.610
<v Speaker 2>him and went into course through your </v>
<v Speaker 2>veins and your arteries and you walk out</v>

301
00:14:27.611 --> 00:14:29.260
<v Speaker 2>of there thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

302
00:14:29.261 --> 00:14:31.330
<v Speaker 2>that was the most interesting thing I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever done in my life.</v>

303
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.223
<v Speaker 2>You don't even care what you get on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>test after that because you got touched </v>

304
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.733
<v Speaker 2>and you became an enlightened </v>
<v Speaker 2>participant and that exercise in that </v>

305
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.300
<v Speaker 2>exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

306
00:14:41.301 --> 00:14:42.134
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard for them to even get kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention though unfortunately matches </v>

307
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.033
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately that could be in some </v>

308
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:50.283
<v Speaker 2>places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half the energy of the teachers is </v>

309
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.500
<v Speaker 2>maintaining order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the success of your book,</v>

310
00:14:54.501 --> 00:14:55.334
<v Speaker 2>the success of your show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your podcast and many of these other </v>

311
00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:58.813
<v Speaker 2>really intelligent podcasts are showing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's an appetite for this stuff </v>

312
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:02.020
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

313
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:07.060
<v Speaker 2>And I'm delighted to be a servant of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that curiosity and um,</v>

314
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.003
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought this just because it's not </v>

315
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:14.120
<v Speaker 2>even out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is your earring,</v>

316
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:15.490
<v Speaker 2>like now live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>

317
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.370
<v Speaker 2>You realize you were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

318
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:23.100
<v Speaker 2>So this is like a five second delay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or is that the belief on my ex?</v>

319
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.140
<v Speaker 2>What is the successor to war?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

320
00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:28.850
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like another book.</v>

321
00:15:28.851 --> 00:15:31.030
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is coming out in three weeks.</v>

322
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Was this about space for accessory to </v>
<v Speaker 2>war?</v>

323
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:39.440
<v Speaker 2>The unspoken alliance between </v>
<v Speaker 2>astrophysics and the military?</v>

324
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

325
00:15:40.911 --> 00:15:41.744
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this other book was astrophysics for </v>

326
00:15:43.131 --> 00:15:46.610
<v Speaker 2>people in a hurry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're in a hurry,</v>

327
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.640
<v Speaker 2>do not buy this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that are.</v>

328
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.520
<v Speaker 2>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not what.</v>

329
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:57.290
<v Speaker 2>This is not an impulse item at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>checkout line that says you got this is.</v>

330
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:59.060
<v Speaker 2>This is all about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

331
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.240
<v Speaker 2>we know what role the physicist plays in</v>
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>

332
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.940
<v Speaker 2>The physicist makes the bomb invents the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb,</v>

333
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.253
<v Speaker 2>the chemist perfects napalm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biologists weaponizes anthrax and </v>

334
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:15.074
<v Speaker 2>the astrophysicist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well we sit at the end of a telescope </v>

335
00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:18.044
<v Speaker 2>and wait for photons to cross the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe and enter our detector and we </v>

336
00:16:22.341 --> 00:16:24.740
<v Speaker 2>go into conferences and argue about </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

337
00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:30.130
<v Speaker 2>So there is no obvious connection </v>
<v Speaker 2>between what we do and military strength</v>

338
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.850
<v Speaker 2>had Gemini,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dominance empire building.</v>

339
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:40.580
<v Speaker 2>It's just not obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why the subtitle,</v>

340
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.300
<v Speaker 2>the unspoken alliance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a secret,</v>

341
00:16:44.301 --> 00:16:46.790
<v Speaker 2>it's just not there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's there,</v>

342
00:16:46.791 --> 00:16:48.560
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's talking about it.</v>

343
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Do you realize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just give an example.</v>

344
00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you needed more reasons to think that</v>

345
00:16:55.161 --> 00:16:56.980
<v Speaker 2>Columbus was a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

346
00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Let me add one to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we were kids and today.</v>

347
00:17:01.881 --> 00:17:02.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

348
00:17:02.241 --> 00:17:03.074
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually I do have something smiled </v>

349
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.260
<v Speaker 2>redeeming to offer about Columbus if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the time.</v>

350
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.250
<v Speaker 2>I just want to start off with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want me start out with that?</v>

351
00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.960
<v Speaker 2>With how you want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll do the dick part as a dick.</v>

352
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on his third voyage,</v>

353
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.290
<v Speaker 2>he's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time he have his third voyage,</v>

354
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.243
<v Speaker 2>he had already planted enough Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 2>flags that Spain had already begun to </v>

355
00:17:25.101 --> 00:17:30.101
<v Speaker 2>set up governments and infrastructures </v>
<v Speaker 2>in these places that he had a compound.</v>

356
00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:35.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically conquered and so,</v>

357
00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.070
<v Speaker 2>so in one of the places I was in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>book accurately,</v>

358
00:17:40.071 --> 00:17:42.650
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's Hispaniola one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>island today,</v>

359
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.080
<v Speaker 2>he has to get back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this third voyage?</v>

360
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.921
<v Speaker 2>15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

361
00:17:45.921 --> 00:17:46.910
<v Speaker 2>3:15.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh four.</v>

362
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.040
<v Speaker 2>He's got to get back to Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have enough,</v>

363
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:50.070
<v Speaker 2>not</v>

364
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.190
<v Speaker 1>enough food for his crew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he asks the natives,</v>

365
00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:54.623
<v Speaker 1>would you please give us some of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>stock that you have collected from your </v>

366
00:17:59.341 --> 00:18:00.450
<v Speaker 1>farming?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

367
00:18:00.451 --> 00:18:01.284
<v Speaker 1>this particular group of natives only </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes exactly the amount of food they </v>

368
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:08.310
<v Speaker 1>need to tie to the next crop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have surplus,</v>

369
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:09.750
<v Speaker 1>so they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

370
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.400
<v Speaker 1>we don't have surplus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

371
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.133
<v Speaker 1>Columbus knew that one week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hence coincidentally there was gonna be </v>

372
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:21.540
<v Speaker 1>a total lunar eclipse with a moon in its</v>
<v Speaker 1>orbit around Earth,</v>

373
00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:22.374
<v Speaker 1>enters earth's shadow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The full moon enters earth shadow and </v>

374
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:30.290
<v Speaker 1>disappears and that the geometry of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>event,</v>

375
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.080
<v Speaker 1>it's just a simple lunar eclipse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the geometry of sets,</v>

376
00:18:34.081 --> 00:18:34.914
<v Speaker 1>that sunlight passes around earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>through earth's atmosphere and takes on </v>

377
00:18:38.671 --> 00:18:43.470
<v Speaker 1>sunset colors that Leech into Earth's </v>
<v Speaker 1>shadow giving the moon.</v>

378
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:48.030
<v Speaker 1>If you can see it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deep red amber hue,</v>

379
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:49.913
<v Speaker 1>almost the color of blood Columbus set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he knew about this because he had </v>

380
00:18:53.611 --> 00:18:56.240
<v Speaker 1>read the tables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eclipse tables.</v>

381
00:18:56.290 --> 00:18:57.123
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had known enough about the solar </v>

382
00:18:58.741 --> 00:19:02.760
<v Speaker 1>system at the time to w we we got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

383
00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.541
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then,</v>

384
00:19:03.541 --> 00:19:07.080
<v Speaker 1>it was just the known world with Earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the known universe,</v>

385
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.600
<v Speaker 1>but that didn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rhythms of the universe were known.</v>

386
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.260
<v Speaker 1>He says to the natives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do not give us food,</v>

387
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.753
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more powerful than your God </v>

388
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.900
<v Speaker 1>will make the moon disappear and it will</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn blood red.</v>

389
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.260
<v Speaker 1>That will happen in one week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have one week to comply.</v>

390
00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Some of them were skeptical of what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

391
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.320
<v Speaker 1>What others said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got it to what this guy said.</v>

392
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Look at the ships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came in,</v>

393
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.290
<v Speaker 1>their guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their power,</v>

394
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:35.910
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their culture.</v>

395
00:19:35.911 --> 00:19:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Look what they've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure enough,</v>

396
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.650
<v Speaker 1>right on cue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon begins to disappear.</v>

397
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.550
<v Speaker 1>According to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a famous woodcut.</v>

398
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 1>You know you got this.</v>

399
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.513
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those viewing the video of this as a </v>

400
00:19:52.021 --> 00:19:52.854
<v Speaker 1>famous woodcut and notice the natives </v>
<v Speaker 1>bowing to him and he stands proudly </v>

401
00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.070
<v Speaker 1>because he knows the science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows the astronomy.</v>

402
00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.173
<v Speaker 1>He knew this and so he invokes this to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominate people who are not yet </v>

403
00:20:06.241 --> 00:20:09.510
<v Speaker 1>scientifically literate and within </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds of this beginning,</v>

404
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:12.700
<v Speaker 1>they bring them all the resources he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants and he gets out.</v>

405
00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.100
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

406
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.100
<v Speaker 1>back at the island whether the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive the winter,</v>

407
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.293
<v Speaker 1>but he got back to the island that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is one microcosm of a set of ways that </v>

408
00:20:22.831 --> 00:20:25.980
<v Speaker 1>the universe has been invoked in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you another example.</v>

409
00:20:25.981 --> 00:20:26.814
<v Speaker 1>Los Alamos national labs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they today as basically since their </v>

410
00:20:31.141 --> 00:20:31.974
<v Speaker 1>inception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are charged with tracking the nuclear </v>

411
00:20:36.181 --> 00:20:39.120
<v Speaker 1>arsenal of the United States are nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

412
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.060
<v Speaker 1>The nukes that would go into nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>

413
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.180
<v Speaker 1>They think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you realize they hire astrophysicist?</v>

414
00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I had colleagues work in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

415
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Because there is a room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two rooms.</v>

416
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:51.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

417
00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:52.243
<v Speaker 1>I'm simplifying this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically there are two rooms </v>

418
00:20:54.071 --> 00:20:57.250
<v Speaker 1>adjacent to one another and a computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the two of them,</v>

419
00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.533
<v Speaker 1>the most powerful computers in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there is code running on those </v>

420
00:21:02.171 --> 00:21:07.171
<v Speaker 1>computers that calculate the energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>yield of hydrogen fusion.</v>

421
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.600
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what an astrophysicist </v>
<v Speaker 1>cares about when stars blow up.</v>

422
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:14.793
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun is undergoing nuclear fusion </v>

423
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:20.500
<v Speaker 1>right now and that's how it's making </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy and when the.</v>

424
00:21:20.501 --> 00:21:22.850
<v Speaker 1>When high mass stars dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they explode.</v>

425
00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:23.743
<v Speaker 1>Supernova.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a natural thing going on there </v>

426
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:28.990
<v Speaker 1>in the universe on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a classified room.</v>

427
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.333
<v Speaker 1>They're calculating yield of hydrogen </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs and they have lunch together and </v>

428
00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.063
<v Speaker 1>they compare notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government doesn't always have the </v>

429
00:21:39.281 --> 00:21:40.114
<v Speaker 1>best people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you hire some of the best people </v>

430
00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:43.983
<v Speaker 1>to do whatever it is they want and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>calculations happen to relate to a </v>

431
00:21:47.831 --> 00:21:52.090
<v Speaker 1>military project there you have a two </v>
<v Speaker 1>way street in progress.</v>

432
00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think the Hubble telescope </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

433
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.510
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mirror issues not withstanding which</v>

434
00:21:58.511 --> 00:22:00.340
<v Speaker 1>were ultimately fixed when it was first </v>
<v Speaker 1>launched,</v>

435
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.353
<v Speaker 1>why was that so successful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were versions of the Hubble </v>

436
00:22:03.911 --> 00:22:08.911
<v Speaker 1>telescope previously launched by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>military looking down that,</v>

437
00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.800
<v Speaker 1>that the model for that telescope had </v>
<v Speaker 1>already been conceived and built and was</v>

438
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:16.640
<v Speaker 1>operating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we say,</v>

439
00:22:16.641 --> 00:22:17.620
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want one of those.</v>

440
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not public that this is going</v>

441
00:22:20.171 --> 00:22:22.180
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We designed with the telescope,</v>

442
00:22:22.181 --> 00:22:23.014
<v Speaker 1>gets designed as the benefit of previous</v>
<v Speaker 1>versions of it having been used </v>

443
00:22:26.051 --> 00:22:29.530
<v Speaker 1>successfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but looking down and we look up,</v>

444
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:31.143
<v Speaker 1>this is the perennial two way street of </v>
<v Speaker 1>astronomy in the old days and in modern </v>

445
00:22:35.891 --> 00:22:36.724
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>astrophysics and the invention of the </v>

446
00:22:38.711 --> 00:22:40.760
<v Speaker 1>telescope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't said anything yet or are you</v>

447
00:22:40.761 --> 00:22:42.100
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a good listener.</v>

448
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:43.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll should I keep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just keep talking.</v>

449
00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.850
<v Speaker 1>What am I preventing you from </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrupting?</v>

450
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

451
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.180
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Galileo perfects the telescope.</v>

452
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.520
<v Speaker 1>He learned that it had just been </v>
<v Speaker 1>invented in the Netherlands.</v>

453
00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.160
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch were were up opticians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

454
00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.013
<v Speaker 1>so they invented the telescope and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>microscope within a couple of years of </v>

455
00:23:02.351 --> 00:23:04.480
<v Speaker 1>one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This transformed science.</v>

456
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:07.120
<v Speaker 1>When did they invent the eyeglass?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reading class?</v>

457
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:09.010
<v Speaker 1>The reading class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was earlier than that,</v>

458
00:23:09.011 --> 00:23:09.844
<v Speaker 1>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when the real advance was </v>

459
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:13.480
<v Speaker 1>putting two lenses in line with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

460
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Sounds trivial in modern times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was a huge leap.</v>

461
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Conceptual leap and what you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplish and in so doing,</v>

462
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.020
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you curve them and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>you grind them,</v>

463
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.630
<v Speaker 1>grind the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shape of those lenses,</v>

464
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.610
<v Speaker 1>you would get a microscope or telescope </v>
<v Speaker 1>and and we're off to the races.</v>

465
00:23:30.611 --> 00:23:34.240
<v Speaker 1>That's basically the birth of modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>science as we now think of it and,</v>

466
00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.110
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

467
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.220
<v Speaker 1>and conducted.</v>

468
00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:41.290
<v Speaker 1>Because you say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sense is I don't trust them to be the</v>

469
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.690
<v Speaker 1>full record of what's going on in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of me.</v>

470
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.860
<v Speaker 1>You pull out a microscope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh.</v>

471
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:51.260
<v Speaker 1>He got the microscope guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought he got a drop of pond water,</v>

472
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.860
<v Speaker 1>puts it under his microscope just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think to do this.</v>

473
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:56.203
<v Speaker 1>It's just water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that's something </v>

474
00:23:58.011 --> 00:23:59.180
<v Speaker 1>interesting to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

475
00:23:59.181 --> 00:24:01.100
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was curious.</v>

476
00:24:01.101 --> 00:24:05.730
<v Speaker 1>He puts it under and sees little what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>described as an macules.</v>

477
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.063
<v Speaker 1>Happily a swimming anime macules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are like the Amoebas and </v>

478
00:24:11.031 --> 00:24:13.820
<v Speaker 1>paramecium and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

479
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.360
<v Speaker 1>And so he writes a heat reports on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

480
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:22.540
<v Speaker 1>to the scientific authorities and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't believe in a,</v>

481
00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:27.580
<v Speaker 1>say a bodily one hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think you might have had too much gin</v>

482
00:24:29.721 --> 00:24:33.680
<v Speaker 1>before you wrote this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would anyone believe this?</v>

483
00:24:33.681 --> 00:24:37.820
<v Speaker 1>That there's entire creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an entire universe of creatures thriving</v>

484
00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:38.683
<v Speaker 1>in a drop of pond water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the way science works is one </v>

485
00:24:43.071 --> 00:24:44.690
<v Speaker 1>report does not make it true.</v>

486
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.553
<v Speaker 1>You need verification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They send people to the Netherlands to </v>

487
00:24:47.751 --> 00:24:48.584
<v Speaker 1>verify as results and there it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the birth of microscopy and then they </v>

488
00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:54.850
<v Speaker 1>looked at everything sells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:57.170
<v Speaker 1>they need vocabulary to describe what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're now seeing.</v>

490
00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the.</v>

491
00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.053
<v Speaker 1>The journey down small than the journey </v>
<v Speaker 1>went up big and Galileo perfects the </v>

492
00:25:04.161 --> 00:25:06.080
<v Speaker 1>telescope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks up and says,</v>

493
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see craters,</v>

494
00:25:08.001 --> 00:25:09.170
<v Speaker 1>mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>valleys on the moon,</v>

495
00:25:09.171 --> 00:25:13.460
<v Speaker 1>and the sun has spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venus goes through phases.</v>

496
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
<v Speaker 1>This became the Corpus of evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth going around the sun in Supportive</v>

497
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Copernicus's idea that earth went around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun.</v>

498
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:23.983
<v Speaker 1>My point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the second thing he did with </v>

499
00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:28.440
<v Speaker 1>his telescope?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He telephone nothing.</v>

500
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:30.793
<v Speaker 1>He contacted the Doge of Venice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>invited him to the cocktail hour and </v>

501
00:25:34.941 --> 00:25:35.774
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at what this instrument can do for </v>

502
00:25:37.041 --> 00:25:39.080
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we look out into the lagoon,</v>

503
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:40.303
<v Speaker 1>you can identify a ship's intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend or foe by its flag 10 times </v>

504
00:25:46.281 --> 00:25:49.400
<v Speaker 1>farther away than you can with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unaided eye.</v>

505
00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.573
<v Speaker 1>Venice bought a boat load of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>telescopes in the service of their </v>

506
00:25:55.611 --> 00:25:56.444
<v Speaker 1>military defense and this was a source </v>
<v Speaker 1>of money to Galileo and now he could go </v>

507
00:26:01.671 --> 00:26:02.504
<v Speaker 1>look at the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has been a two way street ever </v>

508
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:08.540
<v Speaker 1>since people have looked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is.</v>

509
00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.400
<v Speaker 1>This is an accounting of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is it's and and it's it,</v>

510
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:16.790
<v Speaker 1>it goes on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first x ray machines for airports.</v>

511
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.193
<v Speaker 1>You're old enough to remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they put in because of </v>

512
00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:20.744
<v Speaker 1>hijackings to Cuba basically that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were armed hijackings of airplanes of </v>

513
00:26:24.741 --> 00:26:28.070
<v Speaker 1>American carriers to Cuba and Congress </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

514
00:26:28.071 --> 00:26:29.420
<v Speaker 1>we gotta do something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

515
00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:30.254
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a company in Boston called </v>

516
00:26:31.251 --> 00:26:35.240
<v Speaker 1>American Science and engineering that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was building an x ray detector,</v>

517
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:36.343
<v Speaker 1>small enough to put on a satellite to </v>
<v Speaker 1>observe the universe and x rays at </v>

518
00:26:41.761 --> 00:26:42.594
<v Speaker 1>because no one had zero.</v>

519
00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:43.453
<v Speaker 1>We've used visible light but not extra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a branch or the electromagnetic </v>

520
00:26:45.841 --> 00:26:46.674
<v Speaker 1>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think if there are black holes out </v>

521
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.353
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their region surrounding them will give </v>

522
00:26:51.031 --> 00:26:54.960
<v Speaker 1>us x rays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a new window on the universe,</v>

523
00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.270
<v Speaker 1>and then they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

524
00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.160
<v Speaker 1>there's a call for x ray machines at </v>
<v Speaker 1>airports.</v>

525
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.053
<v Speaker 1>We've got the technology that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfected to put in a fricking </v>

526
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:05.850
<v Speaker 1>satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the technology for those ones,</v>

527
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:08.400
<v Speaker 1>you walked through the airport initially</v>
<v Speaker 1>came initially.</v>

528
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

529
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.790
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a two way street.</v>

530
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:12.571
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my gosh,</v>

531
00:27:12.571 --> 00:27:14.550
<v Speaker 1>we need this for security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh by God we would.</v>

532
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:15.870
<v Speaker 1>We were using.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's let.</v>

533
00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Let's apply that technology to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>detectors.</v>

534
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:19.613
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been a lot of the stuff with the </v>

535
00:27:20.191 --> 00:27:21.150
<v Speaker 1>space program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

536
00:27:21.151 --> 00:27:21.984
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of the stuff that they devised</v>
<v Speaker 1>for use on the space station and some </v>

537
00:27:24.951 --> 00:27:27.330
<v Speaker 1>many other technologies have trickled </v>
<v Speaker 1>their way down into.</v>

538
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:32.010
<v Speaker 1>That always happens and even some simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>things because people say,</v>

539
00:27:32.011 --> 00:27:34.890
<v Speaker 1>why spend money up there and we should </v>
<v Speaker 1>be spending it down here.</v>

540
00:27:34.891 --> 00:27:37.920
<v Speaker 1>But there's interesting fact here that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is almost never discussed.</v>

541
00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.653
<v Speaker 1>The people who who think about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe and study of the universe are </v>

542
00:27:42.061 --> 00:27:46.710
<v Speaker 1>hugely creative and the creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>energies cannot be pre-prescribed.</v>

543
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:47.971
<v Speaker 1>You can go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

544
00:27:47.971 --> 00:27:48.804
<v Speaker 1>create might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know that you'll get their </v>

545
00:27:50.551 --> 00:27:51.840
<v Speaker 1>maximum creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

546
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.210
<v Speaker 1>I need you to invent a cure for cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

547
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Use that brilliance out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try.</v>

548
00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:01.130
<v Speaker 1>But the greatest discoveries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest cures,</v>

549
00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:06.140
<v Speaker 1>the greatest of these comes from a cross</v>
<v Speaker 1>pollination of interest that people have</v>

550
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.393
<v Speaker 1>that where they were engaged because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were interest interested just for </v>

551
00:28:12.901 --> 00:28:15.460
<v Speaker 1>the sake of being interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So watch now.</v>

552
00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:17.190
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The space shuttle.</v>

553
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a glider when it lands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

554
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:21.990
<v Speaker 1>it's got no engines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got flaps.</v>

555
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.820
<v Speaker 1>There's a little bit of brakes and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tires,</v>

556
00:28:23.821 --> 00:28:27.030
<v Speaker 1>but that's about it when it comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

557
00:28:27.031 --> 00:28:27.864
<v Speaker 1>How do you make sure the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stays on track because they kept </v>

558
00:28:31.111 --> 00:28:33.240
<v Speaker 1>drifting and cross winds and this sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

559
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.960
<v Speaker 1>And so they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we groove the road so that the</v>

560
00:28:36.961 --> 00:28:37.794
<v Speaker 1>rubber on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the the runway so that the rubber can </v>

561
00:28:41.521 --> 00:28:42.354
<v Speaker 1>align with the grooves and stay in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight line because rubber doesn't </v>

562
00:28:44.731 --> 00:28:48.990
<v Speaker 1>slide well when you have doesn't slide </v>
<v Speaker 1>sideways very easily on crews.</v>

563
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.660
<v Speaker 1>When they realized how effective that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

564
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:53.363
<v Speaker 1>it's now put on off ramps to freeways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's a freeway off ramp that's a </v>

565
00:28:57.511 --> 00:28:59.940
<v Speaker 1>little tight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not quite banked well enough,</v>

566
00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.700
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be grooved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check it out next time.</v>

567
00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.380
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

568
00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.600
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty simple.</v>

569
00:29:06.601 --> 00:29:08.280
<v Speaker 1>Low tech solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't we?</v>

570
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Why couldn't we just discovered that on </v>
<v Speaker 1>our own without the $20,000,000,000</v>

571
00:29:12.151 --> 00:29:15.690
<v Speaker 1>a year space agency called NASA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't,</v>

572
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.970
<v Speaker 1>you didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Power tools,</v>

573
00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.103
<v Speaker 1>cordless high torque power tools were </v>
<v Speaker 1>invented to service satellites in orbit </v>

574
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:29.423
<v Speaker 1>by NASA because you can't just plug it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into 120 volt socket when you're </v>

575
00:29:33.241 --> 00:29:36.420
<v Speaker 1>floating in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the engineer said,</v>

576
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:39.540
<v Speaker 1>how are we going to solve this problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make a high torque power tool.</v>

577
00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 1>So now NASA invents the heightened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

578
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.450
<v Speaker 2>that is the only way you're buying a </v>
<v Speaker 2>power tool today is the,</v>

579
00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:46.373
<v Speaker 2>is the cordless variety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all construction sites that are looking </v>

580
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:54.421
<v Speaker 2>for a power outlet for these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why didn't we invent this without the</v>

581
00:29:55.031 --> 00:29:55.900
<v Speaker 2>$20,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>space?</v>

582
00:29:55.901 --> 00:29:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't,</v>

583
00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.040
<v Speaker 2>you weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't think about it.</v>

584
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.001
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

585
00:30:01.001 --> 00:30:02.290
<v Speaker 2>I can plug it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is great.</v>

586
00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:05.410
<v Speaker 2>You're not even thinking what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

587
00:30:05.411 --> 00:30:08.050
<v Speaker 2>there are all of these applications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

588
00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:11.080
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think that's a good reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it,</v>

589
00:30:11.081 --> 00:30:13.780
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it's the best of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best reasons are my gosh,</v>

590
00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.093
<v Speaker 2>don't you want to keep dreaming?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you want to keep looking into the </v>

591
00:30:17.201 --> 00:30:19.000
<v Speaker 2>future?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be ideal,</v>

592
00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:19.893
<v Speaker 2>but that's not attractive to people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are spending tax dollars when it comes </v>

593
00:30:21.941 --> 00:30:24.670
<v Speaker 2>to tax dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get super pragmatic and they go,</v>

594
00:30:24.671 --> 00:30:26.560
<v Speaker 2>why do we need to go to Mars now?</v>

595
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.393
<v Speaker 2>What we need to do is take care of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and pay for that and with a deficit and </v>

596
00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:33.910
<v Speaker 2>the budget and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you know,</v>

597
00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:34.883
<v Speaker 2>and that's his budget today is four </v>
<v Speaker 2>tenths of one percent of the federal </v>

598
00:30:40.811 --> 00:30:43.660
<v Speaker 2>budget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you take a dollar or ten cents,</v>

599
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:49.200
<v Speaker 2>I will quantify that for it to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take a dollar bill and imagine that your</v>

600
00:30:49.361 --> 00:30:53.650
<v Speaker 2>tax dollar and you can like cut it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever percentage you want.</v>

601
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.950
<v Speaker 2>So let's cut four tenths of one percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>off of the edge.</v>

602
00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:58.443
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't get you into the ink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're still in the white border around </v>

603
00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:02.614
<v Speaker 2>it already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even notice that you can trim that off </v>

604
00:31:05.351 --> 00:31:07.270
<v Speaker 2>the dollar and pay for it and pay for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

605
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:12.010
<v Speaker 2>So my point is most of the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>say don't spend it here,</v>

606
00:31:12.011 --> 00:31:12.844
<v Speaker 2>spend it there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think NASA has more budget than it </v>

607
00:31:16.991 --> 00:31:17.824
<v Speaker 2>actually does.</v>

608
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.010
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

609
00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:20.680
<v Speaker 2>If you asked them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much do you think getting,</v>

610
00:31:20.681 --> 00:31:21.820
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 percent,</v>

611
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:23.740
<v Speaker 2>five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

612
00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.700
<v Speaker 2>several percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

613
00:31:24.701 --> 00:31:25.534
<v Speaker 2>it's one half of one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're going to tell me that if </v>

614
00:31:28.631 --> 00:31:29.464
<v Speaker 2>you can take that four tenths of one </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent and spend it in these other </v>

615
00:31:33.581 --> 00:31:35.770
<v Speaker 2>problems and solve them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

616
00:31:35.771 --> 00:31:37.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go right ahead.</v>

617
00:31:37.181 --> 00:31:38.014
<v Speaker 2>But is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this where you really want to pull </v>

618
00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:40.354
<v Speaker 2>the money from when it's the only thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that God has us thinking about tomorrow </v>

619
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:45.810
<v Speaker 2>is just thinking about a future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

620
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:47.200
<v Speaker 2>forgot like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's super important.</v>

621
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:51.400
<v Speaker 2>But for a guy who lives in Cleveland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who doesn't give a shit about science?</v>

622
00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:52.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me.</v>

623
00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:54.850
<v Speaker 2>That's like the person who says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

624
00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't need the space program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

625
00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:57.993
<v Speaker 2>why do I need this space for Andre?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have my cell phone and I have the </v>

626
00:32:00.401 --> 00:32:02.710
<v Speaker 2>weather channel and I know anything I </v>
<v Speaker 2>need,</v>

627
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

628
00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:10.570
<v Speaker 2>you're using gps satellites to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand where you are on this earth.</v>

629
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:13.200
<v Speaker 2>You to notice they were grandma's house </v>
<v Speaker 2>is when you pull it.</v>

630
00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:14.470
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who created what?</v>

631
00:32:14.530 --> 00:32:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Who created spread spectrum technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>that led the GPS and Wifi.</v>

632
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Who is that heady Lamarr?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

633
00:32:19.991 --> 00:32:21.080
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

634
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:22.900
<v Speaker 2>the actress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 41.</v>

635
00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:23.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she did.</v>

636
00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:26.110
<v Speaker 2>About the underrecognized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We reminded me of super hot though.</v>

637
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:28.120
<v Speaker 2>That was the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody cared.</v>

638
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:30.041
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

639
00:32:30.041 --> 00:32:31.260
<v Speaker 2>you're smart too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

640
00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:32.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

641
00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:34.460
<v Speaker 2>it would take decades to really realize </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

642
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>GPS is launched by the military and it's</v>

643
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 2>now hundreds of billions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 2>worth of</v>

644
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.180
<v Speaker 1>the American economy thriving on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>space application,</v>

645
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.193
<v Speaker 1>but it was a military intent and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>to navigate the surface of the earth to </v>

646
00:32:50.811 --> 00:32:54.350
<v Speaker 1>navigate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the first Gulf War was the first big</v>

647
00:32:54.351 --> 00:32:58.760
<v Speaker 1>use of space assets in the conduct of </v>
<v Speaker 1>military operations.</v>

648
00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:03.440
<v Speaker 1>I believe in even when hetty Lamar </v>
<v Speaker 1>created it with another scientist.</v>

649
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:04.333
<v Speaker 1>The idea behind it was for encoded </v>
<v Speaker 1>encoded transcriptions are encoded </v>

650
00:33:08.601 --> 00:33:10.760
<v Speaker 1>information during the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

651
00:33:10.761 --> 00:33:14.780
<v Speaker 1>so that's a big challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you encode information?</v>

652
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:15.733
<v Speaker 1>That's by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future of this might might come </v>

653
00:33:18.981 --> 00:33:20.630
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still not clear.</v>

654
00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:23.570
<v Speaker 1>The jury is still out in their sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposing views on this,</v>

655
00:33:23.571 --> 00:33:24.404
<v Speaker 1>but you've heard about quantum entangled</v>
<v Speaker 1>particles where I can create a pair of </v>

656
00:33:28.641 --> 00:33:29.474
<v Speaker 1>particles that know about one another </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now they separated in space and in </v>

657
00:33:32.781 --> 00:33:37.430
<v Speaker 1>time and if you observed that other </v>
<v Speaker 1>particle,</v>

658
00:33:37.431 --> 00:33:40.790
<v Speaker 1>it instantly changes the state of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>particle back.</v>

659
00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:42.770
<v Speaker 1>The other particle that's back where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>am,</v>

660
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:47.690
<v Speaker 1>and by the way that they communicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously faster than the speed of</v>

661
00:33:47.691 --> 00:33:49.370
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say if you observed,</v>

662
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:52.880
<v Speaker 1>do you mean that if you observe it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

663
00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.370
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to do something you have to</v>

664
00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:56.180
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

665
00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.980
<v Speaker 1>so something has to interact with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not woo woo,</v>

666
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:01.820
<v Speaker 1>but people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you say that people go,</v>

667
00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:03.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that in the secret.</v>

668
00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the problem is the word observe.</v>

669
00:34:06.591 --> 00:34:08.960
<v Speaker 1>People thinks there's a psychological </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

670
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.420
<v Speaker 1>but in physics is got nothing to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With measurement,</v>

671
00:34:11.421 --> 00:34:13.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a measurement thing and so in other</v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

672
00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:15.643
<v Speaker 1>if there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there is an electron city in the </v>

673
00:34:16.731 --> 00:34:18.710
<v Speaker 1>middle of this table and all the lights </v>
<v Speaker 1>are out,</v>

674
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I can say I think there's an electron </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

675
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Let me find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the moment I turn on the lights,</v>

676
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.570
<v Speaker 1>the light interacts.</v>

677
00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Photon interacts with electron and kicks</v>
<v Speaker 1>it somewhere else.</v>

678
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.730
<v Speaker 1>So the more I try to measure its </v>
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>

679
00:34:31.731 --> 00:34:35.590
<v Speaker 1>the less I know it's position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because you need to,</v>

680
00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.900
<v Speaker 1>the measurement requires an interaction </v>
<v Speaker 1>with it and on.</v>

681
00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:39.843
<v Speaker 1>In the quantum scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions changed the state of the </v>

682
00:34:42.501 --> 00:34:44.870
<v Speaker 1>experiment that you're conducting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know this,</v>

683
00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:47.630
<v Speaker 1>we've quantified it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't like it,</v>

684
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:50.720
<v Speaker 1>but we deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the act of dealing with it,</v>

685
00:34:50.721 --> 00:34:55.721
<v Speaker 1>you can exploit that fact for other </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes we exploit quantum craziness to</v>

686
00:34:56.751 --> 00:35:00.920
<v Speaker 1>birth the into the the information </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology revolution.</v>

687
00:35:00.921 --> 00:35:01.754
<v Speaker 1>There is no creation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>storage or retrieval of information </v>

688
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:07.490
<v Speaker 1>without an exploitation of the quantum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

689
00:35:07.491 --> 00:35:08.324
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quantum was discovered in the </v>

690
00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:14.630
<v Speaker 1>quantum physics as a branch of physics </v>
<v Speaker 1>was discovered in the 19 twenties.</v>

691
00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.980
<v Speaker 1>If you weren't around back then and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>tax buddies don't like paying taxes,</v>

692
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:20.000
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you have said?</v>

693
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Why are you spending government money </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

694
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:23.720
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

695
00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.440
<v Speaker 1>on the Adam and on molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't even see them.</v>

696
00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:29.650
<v Speaker 1>What good is it all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kinda would work.</v>

697
00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.460
<v Speaker 1>I just cared about my would adams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

698
00:35:31.461 --> 00:35:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Here I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to shove that where your,</v>

699
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:39.400
<v Speaker 1>where your tax dollar is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it would look like you're wasting</v>

700
00:35:39.901 --> 00:35:41.790
<v Speaker 1>your own time and everybody else's </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

701
00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.300
<v Speaker 1>It would take decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five decades,</v>

702
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:46.613
<v Speaker 1>four or five decades before we had </v>
<v Speaker 1>realized what role that would play in </v>

703
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.760
<v Speaker 1>computing this creation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>storage and retrieval of information.</v>

704
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:54.743
<v Speaker 1>And by some measures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a third of the world's GDP is </v>

705
00:35:56.761 --> 00:36:01.620
<v Speaker 1>traceable to what quantum physics does </v>
<v Speaker 1>for us on a computing scale.</v>

706
00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:03.900
<v Speaker 1>So anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

707
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:04.890
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

708
00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:06.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are ways to do it.</v>

709
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.690
<v Speaker 1>There are certain industries that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>still be there without computing,</v>

710
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.370
<v Speaker 1>but they're made more efficient with it.</v>

711
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:12.623
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So ups tracks all of their trucks with </v>

712
00:36:15.091 --> 00:36:18.600
<v Speaker 1>gps and with a computing devices that </v>
<v Speaker 1>invokes the quantum.</v>

713
00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.260
<v Speaker 1>But ups predates the use of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these tools.</v>

714
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:23.333
<v Speaker 1>But you can look at profits relative to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their efficiencies that are enabled by </v>

715
00:36:27.391 --> 00:36:28.224
<v Speaker 1>these technologies as well as entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>fields that didn't exist before </v>

716
00:36:32.041 --> 00:36:33.720
<v Speaker 1>computing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You add all that up.</v>

717
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:38.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a stunning fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my only point is that you,</v>

718
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:41.543
<v Speaker 1>if you want today to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why study this when we have these other </v>

719
00:36:44.371 --> 00:36:47.700
<v Speaker 1>problems while I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all I do is take you back to the cave.</v>

720
00:36:47.701 --> 00:36:48.391
<v Speaker 1>And let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

721
00:36:48.391 --> 00:36:51.300
<v Speaker 1>we're in a cave and there's a mountain </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there in the valley.</v>

722
00:36:51.301 --> 00:36:53.390
<v Speaker 1>And I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told her that the Cape,</v>

723
00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell the tribe leaders,</v>

724
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:59.160
<v Speaker 1>I want to explore that mountain in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>valley.</v>

725
00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.250
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't afford to send you out there.</v>

726
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Now we have to solve the problems first </v>
<v Speaker 1>before anyone leaves the cave.</v>

727
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:09.893
<v Speaker 1>We laugh at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an absurd claim to make in </v>

728
00:37:14.431 --> 00:37:16.200
<v Speaker 1>caveman days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if anyone did it,</v>

729
00:37:16.201 --> 00:37:17.034
<v Speaker 1>but that's a crazy thought because their</v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions to your problems that might </v>

730
00:37:21.751 --> 00:37:22.584
<v Speaker 1>exist and time has demonstrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely exist by leaving the cave that </v>

731
00:37:27.211 --> 00:37:30.000
<v Speaker 1>you can then discover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

732
00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.740
<v Speaker 1>x voices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just space,</v>

733
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.620
<v Speaker 1>all the frontiers of the unknown </v>
<v Speaker 1>biology,</v>

734
00:37:34.621 --> 00:37:35.970
<v Speaker 1>chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ai,</v>

735
00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:37.643
<v Speaker 1>you know those frontiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you can cross pollinate them </v>

736
00:37:40.471 --> 00:37:41.304
<v Speaker 1>and transformed civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the last example I give and then </v>

737
00:37:43.561 --> 00:37:46.740
<v Speaker 1>I'll shut up because I want to hear you </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to me.</v>

738
00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:48.493
<v Speaker 1>I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't say I want to hear you interact </v>

739
00:37:50.641 --> 00:37:52.170
<v Speaker 1>with what I'm telling you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's one.</v>

740
00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:53.180
<v Speaker 1>You Ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

741
00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:57.900
<v Speaker 1>My physics professor in college study </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe,</v>

742
00:37:57.901 --> 00:37:58.734
<v Speaker 1>love the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>study gas clouds between stars and </v>

743
00:38:02.311 --> 00:38:02.820
<v Speaker 1>studied.</v>

744
00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.460
<v Speaker 1>How would you detect a gas cloud if it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not radiating light?</v>

745
00:38:05.461 --> 00:38:06.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give off radio waves,</v>

746
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.023
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he figured out what kind of radio </v>

747
00:38:09.571 --> 00:38:10.404
<v Speaker 1>waves they give off and why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in this he gained expertise in the </v>

748
00:38:13.771 --> 00:38:14.604
<v Speaker 1>nucleus of the atom and he discovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the nucleus can resonate depending </v>

749
00:38:20.761 --> 00:38:22.350
<v Speaker 1>on the mass of the nucleus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will,</v>

750
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:23.363
<v Speaker 1>which means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on what Adam it is on the </v>

751
00:38:25.111 --> 00:38:28.140
<v Speaker 1>periodic table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will resonate slightly differently.</v>

752
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:31.770
<v Speaker 1>When exposed to the same electromagnetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>field,</v>

753
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:33.203
<v Speaker 1>he discovered a new phenomenon in </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics called nuclear magnetic </v>

754
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.843
<v Speaker 1>resonance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would then take a clever medical </v>

755
00:38:40.211 --> 00:38:41.770
<v Speaker 1>technologists to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

756
00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.250
<v Speaker 1>if you can distinguish one heavy Adam </v>
<v Speaker 1>from another,</v>

757
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:50.200
<v Speaker 1>let me make a machine out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put your body in it,</v>

758
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:55.210
<v Speaker 1>and I can then distinguish one kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue from another.</v>

759
00:38:55.750 --> 00:39:00.310
<v Speaker 1>And thus was born the magnetic resonance</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaging the MRI,</v>

760
00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:01.263
<v Speaker 1>arguably the most potent tool in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>arsenal of modern medicine where I can </v>

761
00:39:06.581 --> 00:39:09.580
<v Speaker 1>diagnose a condition in your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>without cutting you open first.</v>

762
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:10.953
<v Speaker 1>That is based on a principle of physics </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered by a physicist who had no </v>

763
00:39:13.841 --> 00:39:14.674
<v Speaker 1>interest in medicine by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the real title should be nuclear </v>

764
00:39:18.581 --> 00:39:21.940
<v Speaker 1>magnetic resonance imaging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the other end word.</v>

765
00:39:21.941 --> 00:39:25.750
<v Speaker 1>You're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people don't like nuclear,</v>

766
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.793
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're less likely to go inside the </v>

767
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:29.103
<v Speaker 1>machine if there were nuclear was on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my point is that was a cross </v>

768
00:39:32.591 --> 00:39:36.730
<v Speaker 1>pollination of ideas with clever people </v>
<v Speaker 1>on their frontiers.</v>

769
00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:38.073
<v Speaker 1>Looking over the fence at discoveries </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are being made is how we got the </v>

770
00:39:41.651 --> 00:39:42.484
<v Speaker 1>microwave oven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was an invented by </v>

771
00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:44.773
<v Speaker 1>thermodynamicists microwaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a world war two attempt to </v>

772
00:39:48.791 --> 00:39:52.960
<v Speaker 1>communicate using microwaves and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>found out some guys,</v>

773
00:39:52.961 --> 00:39:55.720
<v Speaker 1>chocolate bar melted in the microwave </v>
<v Speaker 1>field and they said what?</v>

774
00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:56.573
<v Speaker 1>What happened there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they did some more tests and of </v>

775
00:39:58.211 --> 00:39:59.044
<v Speaker 1>course the water molecule and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules common in food respond to </v>

776
00:40:03.131 --> 00:40:03.880
<v Speaker 1>microwave.</v>

777
00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:08.880
<v Speaker 1>It vibrates them ferociously and so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>put food in our microwave cavity.</v>

778
00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:15.520
<v Speaker 1>The water content of the food vibrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friction cooks the food.</v>

779
00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.120
<v Speaker 1>There's still people today who say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh nucleus,</v>

780
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:24.470
<v Speaker 1>because they think it's so fast and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>might still have no fear.</v>

781
00:40:27.341 --> 00:40:28.750
<v Speaker 1>It's just friction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

782
00:40:28.751 --> 00:40:29.584
<v Speaker 1>friction it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's scared that it fucks up the </v>

783
00:40:31.421 --> 00:40:32.590
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

784
00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:33.700
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

785
00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:34.930
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just heats.</v>

786
00:40:34.931 --> 00:40:35.950
<v Speaker 1>The water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets scared.</v>

787
00:40:35.951 --> 00:40:37.360
<v Speaker 1>The Woo people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

788
00:40:37.361 --> 00:40:39.940
<v Speaker 1>so here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's certain foods that don't respond</v>

789
00:40:39.941 --> 00:40:43.930
<v Speaker 1>well to the flipping of the water </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecule and one of them ways like bread</v>

790
00:40:43.931 --> 00:40:45.380
<v Speaker 1>products gets hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

791
00:40:45.381 --> 00:40:48.990
<v Speaker 1>it gets chewy and leathery and only if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you overdo,</v>

792
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.863
<v Speaker 1>if you overdo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta do it just right and you're </v>

793
00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:51.820
<v Speaker 1>still good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you overdo it,</v>

794
00:40:51.821 --> 00:40:53.500
<v Speaker 1>it can get loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of it.</v>

795
00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:54.393
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't grill a steak in a </v>

796
00:40:55.871 --> 00:40:56.560
<v Speaker 1>microwave.</v>

797
00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.060
<v Speaker 1>You would heat up the meat uniformly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

798
00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:02.290
<v Speaker 1>That's all it would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A cooks bacon pretty fast,</v>

799
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:04.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's a mess and it splatters all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

800
00:41:04.691 --> 00:41:07.600
<v Speaker 1>So you pick the foods that are best for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that situation.</v>

801
00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.000
<v Speaker 1>As you would pick the foods best you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't.</v>

802
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:15.210
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't put toast in an oven at 350</v>
<v Speaker 1>degrees to bread to make toast.</v>

803
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:17.260
<v Speaker 1>We have toasters for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

804
00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:19.930
<v Speaker 1>So different things in your kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do things best.</v>

805
00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:23.420
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't make ice cream in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

806
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:25.240
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your toaster oven,</v>

807
00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.810
<v Speaker 1>but people are afraid of microwaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that they're afraid of,</v>

808
00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.673
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that they're afraid of </v>

809
00:41:29.981 --> 00:41:31.990
<v Speaker 1>microwaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're afraid of things.</v>

810
00:41:31.991 --> 00:41:34.030
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand that your precise </v>
<v Speaker 1>now</v>

811
00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.620
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid that something's going to</v>

812
00:41:35.621 --> 00:41:38.240
<v Speaker 2>happen to their food that makes it less </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

813
00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just,</v>

814
00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:40.993
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the not knowing that people </v>

815
00:41:43.011 --> 00:41:43.844
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife's friend's mom will not eat </v>

816
00:41:46.551 --> 00:41:49.220
<v Speaker 2>something that comes out of a microwave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

817
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:52.250
<v Speaker 2>She quotes that as part of what makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>her healthy.</v>

818
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Drinks a lot of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She refuses to eat microwave food.</v>

819
00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:58.910
<v Speaker 2>The whole life is around not using </v>
<v Speaker 2>microwave.</v>

820
00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:01.400
<v Speaker 2>She won't eat anything that comes out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a microwave.</v>

821
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that she doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'll.</v>

822
00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.540
<v Speaker 2>She can live a long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy life as such.</v>

823
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:06.950
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her reheat food.</v>

824
00:42:06.951 --> 00:42:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Old School.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

825
00:42:08.181 --> 00:42:10.130
<v Speaker 2>One of the hardest thing is reheating </v>
<v Speaker 2>was on you.</v>

826
00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:11.840
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have a microwave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A true.</v>

827
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:13.490
<v Speaker 2>That's like impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're gonna Cook it again.</v>

828
00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Got To cook it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

829
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.870
<v Speaker 2>that's a really good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think microwave ovens were invented</v>

830
00:42:17.871 --> 00:42:18.704
<v Speaker 2>for leftover lasagna and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just eat a bowl of pasta just in </v>

831
00:42:22.161 --> 00:42:22.700
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

832
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soup soup is good.</v>

833
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have to worry about it.</v>

834
00:42:27.531 --> 00:42:29.060
<v Speaker 2>It's not doing anything to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

835
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:32.630
<v Speaker 2>Not Sucking any nutrients out or adding </v>
<v Speaker 2>any nuclear radiation.</v>

836
00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:34.060
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has nothing to.</v>

837
00:42:34.061 --> 00:42:38.990
<v Speaker 2>With radiation in the normal sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than electromagnetic radiation.</v>

838
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:39.853
<v Speaker 2>It's already light from the bald.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We tend to use radiation in the context </v>

839
00:42:44.301 --> 00:42:47.150
<v Speaker 2>of stuff that would hurt you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would be radiation.</v>

840
00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:50.870
<v Speaker 2>Have high enough energy to hurt you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>microwaves are not in that category.</v>

841
00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:54.500
<v Speaker 2>I never even thought about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>microwaves do until this conversation.</v>

842
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

843
00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a certain frequency of </v>

844
00:42:57.081 --> 00:42:57.914
<v Speaker 2>microwaves that beautifully pairs with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the water molecule and it vibrates it </v>

845
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.633
<v Speaker 2>brilliantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it doesn't work for completely dried </v>

846
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:07.101
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

847
00:43:07.101 --> 00:43:09.380
<v Speaker 2>That's why if you put something that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>no water in it,</v>

848
00:43:09.381 --> 00:43:11.960
<v Speaker 2>it's not really very useful to have beef</v>
<v Speaker 2>jerky.</v>

849
00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.050
<v Speaker 2>It's there's still some moisture in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

850
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:18.890
<v Speaker 2>It's why it eats the food and not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plate.</v>

851
00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:21.933
<v Speaker 2>The plate gets hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not because the microwave oven </v>

852
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:26.750
<v Speaker 2>heated the plate is because the food's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hot food and the food.</v>

853
00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:28.390
<v Speaker 2>That's why I can usually pick it up at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hand.</v>

854
00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:32.570
<v Speaker 2>You can put food on a paper plate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

855
00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:34.640
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't burst into flames and burst </v>
<v Speaker 2>into flames.</v>

856
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:37.180
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

857
00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:40.490
<v Speaker 2>what is the difference between MRI and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Fmr?</v>

858
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:43.310
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so an FMLA claim.</v>

859
00:43:43.311 --> 00:43:44.144
<v Speaker 2>Total expertise here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you the little I know the </v>

860
00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:46.934
<v Speaker 2>MRI,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put you in there and you're </v>

861
00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:48.524
<v Speaker 2>stationary and then they make this map </v>
<v Speaker 2>of whatever part of the body they're </v>

862
00:43:51.291 --> 00:43:53.420
<v Speaker 2>studying is typically your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>

863
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:54.543
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can do it on your joints and </v>

864
00:43:55.281 --> 00:43:56.114
<v Speaker 2>other parts of your body that might </v>
<v Speaker 2>require this level of three dimensional </v>

865
00:43:58.641 --> 00:43:59.474
<v Speaker 2>analysis and it's a three d map of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in the park that they </v>

866
00:44:04.431 --> 00:44:05.264
<v Speaker 2>surveyed.</v>

867
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.450
<v Speaker 2>And so you look at it slices through </v>
<v Speaker 2>that section.</v>

868
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:13.640
<v Speaker 2>So you might see in Mris of your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your skull and they take slices.</v>

869
00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:14.643
<v Speaker 2>You as they slices go through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see like the eye socket come in and </v>

870
00:44:17.271 --> 00:44:19.940
<v Speaker 2>then go out again or the the nose </v>
<v Speaker 2>cavity.</v>

871
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:23.180
<v Speaker 2>And you can look at it in all three </v>
<v Speaker 2>dimensions,</v>

872
00:44:23.181 --> 00:44:27.290
<v Speaker 2>front to back side to side a up to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

873
00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.960
<v Speaker 2>So depending on the sophistication of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the machine,</v>

874
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:34.890
<v Speaker 2>F MRI is they are looking at your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>while you were thinking.</v>

875
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:40.500
<v Speaker 2>So time is now an active coordinate of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on and they're measuring it</v>

876
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.690
<v Speaker 2>as they're talking to you about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they say,</v>

877
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.553
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of the ice cream Sundae with a </v>

878
00:44:45.271 --> 00:44:46.104
<v Speaker 2>cherry on top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but think of a naked person who you'd </v>

879
00:44:49.321 --> 00:44:52.140
<v Speaker 2>want to have sex with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stands for function,</v>

880
00:44:52.141 --> 00:44:53.100
<v Speaker 2>functional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

881
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:53.934
<v Speaker 2>And so it's basically a real time </v>
<v Speaker 2>observation of what's going on in your </v>

882
00:44:58.380 --> 00:44:58.550
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

883
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:59.383
<v Speaker 2>Evict a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a woman in India and it's </v>

884
00:45:01.501 --> 00:45:05.610
<v Speaker 2>really highly criticized case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she was convicted of a crime,</v>

885
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:06.473
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was murder because she had </v>
<v Speaker 2>functional knowledge of the crime scene </v>

886
00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:12.953
<v Speaker 2>and the arguments against it where like </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to be accused of a </v>

887
00:45:15.481 --> 00:45:16.314
<v Speaker 2>crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly you're going to study the </v>

888
00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:19.680
<v Speaker 2>evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna talk to a lawyer,</v>

889
00:45:19.681 --> 00:45:21.270
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go over some things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be,</v>

890
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:24.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if MRI is that precise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

891
00:45:24.821 --> 00:45:28.740
<v Speaker 2>They don't think it is very disturbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this was used in court.</v>

892
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.900
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you remember when these Italian,</v>

893
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:33.930
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>geologists were.</v>

894
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.213
<v Speaker 2>I think they were tried because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>should have known about an earthquake </v>

895
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:41.910
<v Speaker 2>before it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then scientists had to say,</v>

896
00:45:41.911 --> 00:45:44.280
<v Speaker 2>hey guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not how it works.</v>

897
00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:47.910
<v Speaker 2>Like this shit can just happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so.</v>

898
00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:49.291
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

899
00:45:49.291 --> 00:45:53.580
<v Speaker 2>But that's what I do know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me share a couple of things with you</v>

900
00:45:53.581 --> 00:45:54.414
<v Speaker 2>that I've thought deeply about recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are three kinds of truths in the </v>

901
00:45:59.221 --> 00:46:02.130
<v Speaker 2>world because we're in like a three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me.</v>

902
00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

903
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:05.110
<v Speaker 2>The Rudy Giuliani kind.</v>

904
00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you ready?</v>

905
00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:10.680
<v Speaker 2>True isn't always true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

906
00:46:10.681 --> 00:46:12.830
<v Speaker 2>So let me try to unpack that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

907
00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:13.500
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ready?</v>

908
00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alternative facts.</v>

909
00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:17.760
<v Speaker 2>I do something called an objective truth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and objective.</v>

910
00:46:17.761 --> 00:46:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Truth is something that is true whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>or not you believe in it.</v>

911
00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:22.253
<v Speaker 2>And the methods and tools of science are</v>
<v Speaker 2>uniquely conceived to seek out and </v>

912
00:46:27.511 --> 00:46:28.344
<v Speaker 2>establish objective truths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this I'm in referring to the </v>

913
00:46:31.561 --> 00:46:36.561
<v Speaker 2>invocation of the scientific method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one scientific result result research</v>

914
00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:38.003
<v Speaker 2>result is true until it is verified by </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people's research results using a </v>

915
00:46:44.071 --> 00:46:44.904
<v Speaker 2>different experimental method with </v>
<v Speaker 2>different wall current from another </v>

916
00:46:47.401 --> 00:46:49.890
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When your competitor says,</v>

917
00:46:49.891 --> 00:46:51.900
<v Speaker 2>I think you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me show how you're wrong.</v>

918
00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:52.853
<v Speaker 2>And they reproduce your experiment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get the same result when you have </v>

919
00:46:56.071 --> 00:46:56.904
<v Speaker 2>generally the same results emerging that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a newly discovered objective truth </v>

920
00:47:01.921 --> 00:47:04.300
<v Speaker 2>about the natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you have objective truths,</v>

921
00:47:04.301 --> 00:47:09.301
<v Speaker 2>they're not later shown to be false.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an objective truth.</v>

922
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Then you have personal truths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are truths that you hold dearly.</v>

923
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.740
<v Speaker 2>Jesus is your savior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed is the final prophet on earth.</v>

924
00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:24.090
<v Speaker 2>You know Abraham is your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are your personal truths.</v>

925
00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:25.650
<v Speaker 2>There's a heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to.</v>

926
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:27.023
<v Speaker 2>No one is going to take that from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not In a free country where freedom of </v>

927
00:47:29.801 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 2>expression</v>

928
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.690
<v Speaker 1>and speech and religion is protected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a personal truth.</v>

929
00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:35.763
<v Speaker 1>The problem here is you can't convince </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else of your personal truth </v>

930
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:46.000
<v Speaker 1>without some act of persuasion and in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the limit and active violence.</v>

931
00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:47.620
<v Speaker 1>MMM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

932
00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:49.540
<v Speaker 1>In the limit and the limit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

933
00:47:49.541 --> 00:47:50.374
<v Speaker 1>I get holy wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have this personal truth and I </v>

934
00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:56.950
<v Speaker 1>require that you share my personal truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>provides.</v>

935
00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a recipe for disaster and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelief.</v>

936
00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:03.070
<v Speaker 1>Because the people who hold the belief </v>
<v Speaker 1>will tell you that it's the truth.</v>

937
00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.740
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to take that usage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the word away from them.</v>

938
00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're giving them a good definition.</v>

939
00:48:08.291 --> 00:48:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving them the word truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but modifying it to say personal truth.</v>

940
00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.730
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to.</v>

941
00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:16.420
<v Speaker 1>If they've used it that way for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Millennia,</v>

942
00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

943
00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:22.240
<v Speaker 1>They they feel that is true and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>true in their bones.</v>

944
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:26.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm simply saying that because it's your</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal truth,</v>

945
00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:31.450
<v Speaker 1>you cannot require that someone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>share it and in this country,</v>

946
00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:32.493
<v Speaker 1>because the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because God is not mentioned in the </v>

947
00:48:35.561 --> 00:48:38.800
<v Speaker 1>constitution itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a controversial thing in it's day by the</v>

948
00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:43.330
<v Speaker 1>way actually God has mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a very insignificant way that the</v>

949
00:48:43.331 --> 00:48:47.860
<v Speaker 1>constitution is a Godfrey document and </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a Godfrey document,</v>

950
00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:53.070
<v Speaker 1>it protects your expression of religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>face because it means the government has</v>

951
00:48:54.791 --> 00:48:58.480
<v Speaker 1>no say in who and what you believe or </v>
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>

952
00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:02.920
<v Speaker 1>If the constitution said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned God and Jesus,</v>

953
00:49:03.010 --> 00:49:03.671
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

954
00:49:03.671 --> 00:49:07.150
<v Speaker 1>There's Christianity built into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fabric of the country and if you want to</v>

955
00:49:07.151 --> 00:49:09.700
<v Speaker 1>be some other religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna have a hard time because we</v>

956
00:49:09.701 --> 00:49:10.534
<v Speaker 1>can set laws against it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why so many religiously </v>

957
00:49:13.841 --> 00:49:14.674
<v Speaker 1>persecuted people came to the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States to escape their country where </v>

958
00:49:18.581 --> 00:49:19.414
<v Speaker 1>they could not practice their religion a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little differently or a lot differently </v>

959
00:49:22.271 --> 00:49:25.000
<v Speaker 1>from what was going on in their homes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their homeland.</v>

960
00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.373
<v Speaker 1>So the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a problem though to to call it </v>

961
00:49:27.941 --> 00:49:31.210
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would rather not call a truth,</v>

962
00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:32.290
<v Speaker 1>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

963
00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:36.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big word guy and I respect what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens to words.</v>

964
00:49:36.611 --> 00:49:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't always like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I respect it and so I'm going to say</v>

965
00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:42.760
<v Speaker 1>there is an objective truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is true whether or not you believe</v>

966
00:49:42.761 --> 00:49:44.200
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's your personal truth,</v>

967
00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:47.980
<v Speaker 1>which is true to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third Truth is a political truth.</v>

968
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:49.623
<v Speaker 1>Political truth is something that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>true because it has been incessantly </v>

969
00:49:52.931 --> 00:49:53.764
<v Speaker 1>repeated it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you just believe it at that </v>

970
00:49:58.601 --> 00:50:01.080
<v Speaker 1>point on one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

971
00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:03.970
<v Speaker 1>What's Hillary Clinton's first name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crooked,</v>

972
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000
<v Speaker 1>or first name is actually hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

973
00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:11.103
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was crooked Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is was incessantly repeated in the </v>

974
00:50:13.961 --> 00:50:16.930
<v Speaker 1>trump campaign and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an absurd example of it,</v>

975
00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:17.530
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

976
00:50:17.530 --> 00:50:18.363
<v Speaker 1>but the point is if you keep saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you keep saying that the New York </v>

977
00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.373
<v Speaker 1>Times is fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just keeps saying that eventually </v>

978
00:50:25.871 --> 00:50:26.704
<v Speaker 1>people believe it and it becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>political truth because the politicians </v>

979
00:50:32.181 --> 00:50:33.014
<v Speaker 1>repeated it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a political truth that people </v>

980
00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:37.970
<v Speaker 1>believe it or it's a political truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>because people believe it.</v>

981
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Which one is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

982
00:50:39.621 --> 00:50:40.460
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

983
00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:41.673
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you trying to preserve the true </v>

984
00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.540
<v Speaker 1>fundamental meaning of the word truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've just given up on that.</v>

985
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris had </v>
<v Speaker 1>infuriatingly frustrating podcasts where</v>

986
00:50:53.031 --> 00:50:56.450
<v Speaker 1>they went over the meaning of the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth for more than an hour.</v>

987
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:58.040
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

988
00:50:58.041 --> 00:50:58.874
<v Speaker 1>you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And philosophers like arguing and </v>

989
00:51:00.261 --> 00:51:02.870
<v Speaker 1>debating the meaning of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me it's harder.</v>

990
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.880
<v Speaker 1>People are using the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the meaning.</v>

991
00:51:05.380 --> 00:51:06.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

992
00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:08.210
<v Speaker 1>I concede that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

993
00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:13.240
<v Speaker 1>we can see those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why I don't call myself an atheist.</v>

994
00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:14.843
<v Speaker 1>It's why you can look up the dictionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition of atheist and it kind of </v>

995
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:22.580
<v Speaker 1>applies to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is the definition of atheist in</v>

996
00:51:22.581 --> 00:51:23.414
<v Speaker 1>practice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is what leading atheists do and it's </v>

997
00:51:25.851 --> 00:51:28.250
<v Speaker 1>their conduct and their behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they say,</v>

998
00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:29.390
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

999
00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:30.253
<v Speaker 1>it's their attitude that is what an </v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist is today because they're the </v>

1000
00:51:33.861 --> 00:51:38.861
<v Speaker 1>most visible exemplars of that word and </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of their conduct either don't agree</v>

1001
00:51:40.521 --> 00:51:42.290
<v Speaker 1>with or simply don't engage in.</v>

1002
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:46.430
<v Speaker 1>What don't you agree with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't debate religious people and tell</v>

1003
00:51:46.431 --> 00:51:48.590
<v Speaker 1>them they're idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1004
00:51:48.591 --> 00:51:51.510
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's whether or not it works.</v>

1005
00:51:51.511 --> 00:51:53.660
<v Speaker 1>I just not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not in me to do that.</v>

1006
00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:59.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't purge myself of words that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious foundations in them.</v>

1007
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.093
<v Speaker 1>I once in my facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend going up in orbit to </v>

1008
00:52:03.891 --> 00:52:06.980
<v Speaker 1>repair the Hubble Telescope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the astronauts and I said,</v>

1009
00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Godspeed.</v>

1010
00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:12.080
<v Speaker 1>And then I gave the astronauts name </v>
<v Speaker 1>people wrote in,</v>

1011
00:52:12.081 --> 00:52:14.090
<v Speaker 1>in the threads that I thought you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>an atheist.</v>

1012
00:52:14.091 --> 00:52:17.480
<v Speaker 1>How could you say Godspeed and atheist </v>
<v Speaker 1>got angry with me and I said,</v>

1013
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.250
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1014
00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:23.660
<v Speaker 1>this phrase is deeply historical in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>space program.</v>

1015
00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:28.020
<v Speaker 1>When John Glenn was launched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the headline was Godspeed John Glenn.</v>

1016
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Every mission where we send human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>into space somewhere,</v>

1017
00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:36.410
<v Speaker 1>there's that reference in the NASA fancy</v>
<v Speaker 1>word means I'll tell you,</v>

1018
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:37.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what it means.</v>

1019
00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Please do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1020
00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:39.801
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1021
00:52:39.801 --> 00:52:42.590
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get to that in just one minute.</v>

1022
00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:47.960
<v Speaker 1>The atheist who are arguing that I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>using Godspeed as a phrase,</v>

1023
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:52.820
<v Speaker 1>they all have used the phrase goodbye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haven't they see you later?</v>

1024
00:52:52.821 --> 00:52:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Goodbye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that word come from?</v>

1025
00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:56.810
<v Speaker 1>It's from God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be With you.</v>

1026
00:52:56.870 --> 00:53:00.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a contraction of those three words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1027
00:53:00.260 --> 00:53:01.093
<v Speaker 1>and why would you say this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would say this to someone leaving </v>

1028
00:53:03.711 --> 00:53:07.490
<v Speaker 1>the city wall where it's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1029
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Back when you had city states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to you.</v>

1030
00:53:09.631 --> 00:53:14.540
<v Speaker 1>You're a good God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be with you to bring protection for you.</v>

1031
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Between one city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in crowds.</v>

1032
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Look out for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now what is the source of danger?</v>

1033
00:53:21.741 --> 00:53:25.250
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not alien space muggers.</v>

1034
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:26.543
<v Speaker 1>It is the fact that you space marauders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the fact that you have high speed </v>

1035
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:36.720
<v Speaker 1>and high speed is the source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially any death of anything that's</v>

1036
00:53:36.721 --> 00:53:37.554
<v Speaker 1>in motion.</v>

1037
00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:41.520
<v Speaker 1>If you were a part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a disaster.</v>

1038
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:46.760
<v Speaker 1>So Godspeed is like a space equivalent </v>
<v Speaker 1>to God be with you.</v>

1039
00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Is that really the origin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying.</v>

1040
00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:52.520
<v Speaker 1>What did they say that before there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>space travel.</v>

1041
00:53:52.521 --> 00:53:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Did they say Godspeed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the actual origin of space.</v>

1042
00:53:55.351 --> 00:53:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Travel of the term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1043
00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.273
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how far back it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know it became common after </v>

1044
00:54:01.261 --> 00:54:04.140
<v Speaker 1>John Glenn because they're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say it to Yuri Gagarin because they were</v>

1045
00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.780
<v Speaker 1>there all atheists in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Soviet Union,</v>

1046
00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:10.650
<v Speaker 1>but here in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in America,</v>

1047
00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Godspeed John Glenn and I respect that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>

1048
00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.713
<v Speaker 1>And so I said that and then they jumped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if atheist or jumping on me for </v>

1049
00:54:18.751 --> 00:54:19.584
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly I'm not an atheist and asked me </v>

1050
00:54:22.261 --> 00:54:24.630
<v Speaker 1>my favorite Broadway musical of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1051
00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:26.640
<v Speaker 1>What's your favorite?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ superstar.</v>

1052
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:29.460
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1053
00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:34.080
<v Speaker 1>and I still use BC and add in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>writings.</v>

1054
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still don't use bce.</v>

1055
00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:39.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't use VC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

1056
00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh see even you copying the Tude right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

1057
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:44.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw your faith.</v>

1058
00:54:44.761 --> 00:54:47.970
<v Speaker 1>You got the camera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you see as interesting.</v>

1059
00:54:47.971 --> 00:54:49.530
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why.</v>

1060
00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1061
00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:53.310
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The current era,</v>

1062
00:54:53.311 --> 00:54:54.990
<v Speaker 1>2000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good at telling you.</v>

1063
00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.280
<v Speaker 1>So Bca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

1064
00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:59.730
<v Speaker 1>stands for before common era and ce </v>
<v Speaker 1>stands for common era.</v>

1065
00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:05.090
<v Speaker 1>So this is d irreligious of filing a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>D and B NBC.</v>

1066
00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:06.933
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course they referenced the same </v>

1067
00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:09.390
<v Speaker 1>calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1068
00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:13.350
<v Speaker 1>well who invented the calendar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all currently use in modern society.</v>

1069
00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:14.333
<v Speaker 1>It's called the Gregorian calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was invented by the Catholic church </v>

1070
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.633
<v Speaker 1>by Jesuit priests in the 15 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assigned by Pope Gregory to fix the </v>

1071
00:55:22.081 --> 00:55:24.290
<v Speaker 1>problems in the calendar because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

1072
00:55:24.291 --> 00:55:26.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm screaming at you here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can scream.</v>

1073
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:26.821
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

1074
00:55:26.821 --> 00:55:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I got to calm down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll bring him coffee.</v>

1075
00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:32.363
<v Speaker 1>The Julian calendar put forth in ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rome had one modification to previous </v>

1076
00:55:38.671 --> 00:55:39.990
<v Speaker 1>calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had a leap day.</v>

1077
00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had to leap day and okay.</v>

1078
00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Leap Day is how often?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every four years.</v>

1079
00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:51.540
<v Speaker 1>This was good because what are we trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to track?</v>

1080
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:55.260
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth goes around the sun and so we say,</v>

1081
00:55:55.261 --> 00:55:57.150
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long does that take?</v>

1082
00:55:57.151 --> 00:55:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a year,</v>

1083
00:55:58.890 --> 00:55:59.723
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out we're not actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>tracking how long it takes earth to go </v>

1084
00:56:01.471 --> 00:56:06.471
<v Speaker 1>around the sun would tracking how long </v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes earth to repeat its seasons and</v>

1085
00:56:07.051 --> 00:56:07.884
<v Speaker 1>the repeat the year that corresponds to </v>
<v Speaker 1>our seasons is slightly different from </v>

1086
00:56:12.661 --> 00:56:15.540
<v Speaker 1>the year that corresponds to how long it</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes to go around the sun,</v>

1087
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:17.303
<v Speaker 1>slightly different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that difference was not recognized </v>

1088
00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:21.773
<v Speaker 1>in the early calendars and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference accumulated so that by the </v>

1089
00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.390
<v Speaker 1>year 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>84,</v>

1090
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:31.840
<v Speaker 1>the vernal equinox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first day of spring,</v>

1091
00:56:31.841 --> 00:56:33.430
<v Speaker 1>did not occur on March 20.</v>

1092
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:38.430
<v Speaker 1>First it occurred on March 10th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shifted from the calendar date.</v>

1093
00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:41.770
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens if you don't match </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cycles of things.</v>

1094
00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:44.080
<v Speaker 1>And the pope said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not having any of this,</v>

1095
00:56:44.230 --> 00:56:48.040
<v Speaker 1>especially since Easter might land on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Passover and we're trying to distinguish</v>

1096
00:56:48.041 --> 00:56:51.100
<v Speaker 1>ourselves mightily from the Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's fix this.</v>

1097
00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:52.233
<v Speaker 1>The Jesuit priests got to study this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They looked at the cycles of the </v>

1098
00:56:54.521 --> 00:56:55.720
<v Speaker 1>heavens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun,</v>

1099
00:56:55.721 --> 00:56:56.830
<v Speaker 1>the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stars,</v>

1100
00:56:57.130 --> 00:57:00.250
<v Speaker 1>and they came up with a new calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gregorian calendar,</v>

1101
00:57:00.251 --> 00:57:02.410
<v Speaker 1>a modification to the Julian calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1102
00:57:02.411 --> 00:57:06.620
<v Speaker 1>what they have to do to invoke at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take 10 days out of the calendar to,</v>

1103
00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:08.650
<v Speaker 1>to jumpstart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put,</v>

1104
00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:09.773
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first day of Spring Back on March </v>

1105
00:57:11.021 --> 00:57:13.480
<v Speaker 1>21st.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this happened in October 15,</v>

1106
00:57:13.481 --> 00:57:14.314
<v Speaker 1>84.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why has there been 10 days out of the </v>

1107
00:57:16.601 --> 00:57:18.790
<v Speaker 1>calendar that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now how much rent do you pay?</v>

1108
00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:21.190
<v Speaker 1>They had to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>invent amortized rent.</v>

1109
00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:23.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to pay for three </v>

1110
00:57:24.011 --> 00:57:24.844
<v Speaker 1>weeks and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 days instead of 30 that they have to </v>

1111
00:57:26.951 --> 00:57:28.390
<v Speaker 1>figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1112
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Point is this was hard earned and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole world uses this calendar.</v>

1113
00:57:32.561 --> 00:57:34.930
<v Speaker 1>It is the most accurate calendar ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>devised.</v>

1114
00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what.</v>

1115
00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You asked.</v>

1116
00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:43.920
<v Speaker 1>So watch what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The leap day overcorrected the calendar.</v>

1117
00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:48.250
<v Speaker 1>It overcorrected overcorrect yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1118
00:57:48.251 --> 00:57:50.340
<v Speaker 1>So you need to leave here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So No.</v>

1119
00:57:50.341 --> 00:57:51.850
<v Speaker 1>So the leaf days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every four years,</v>

1120
00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:52.923
<v Speaker 1>that one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every four years was slowly putting too </v>

1121
00:57:55.331 --> 00:57:57.850
<v Speaker 1>many days into the moments into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

1122
00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:59.073
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Gregorian calendar figured this out </v>

1123
00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:01.653
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't put 10 extra days since </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Julian calendar to the Gregorian </v>

1124
00:58:05.381 --> 00:58:06.370
<v Speaker 1>count.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten extra days.</v>

1125
00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:08.650
<v Speaker 1>First Jumpstart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get rid of the 10 days,</v>

1126
00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:10.630
<v Speaker 1>now everything's lined up again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1127
00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:12.820
<v Speaker 1>Now how do you prevent this from </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening again?</v>

1128
00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:14.973
<v Speaker 1>Because it overcorrect how long do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to wait to remove a leap day that </v>

1129
00:58:19.661 --> 00:58:23.250
<v Speaker 1>you would otherwise put in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1130
00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:25.660
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's every hundred years.</v>

1131
00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so every hundred years.</v>

1132
00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:32.590
<v Speaker 1>That would be a leap day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You remove the leap day.</v>

1133
00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Now it turns out that under corrects it </v>
<v Speaker 1>by an even smaller amount.</v>

1134
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:40.353
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how long do you have to wait before </v>

1135
00:58:43.571 --> 00:58:48.430
<v Speaker 1>you have to put a leap day back in every</v>
<v Speaker 1>400 years.</v>

1136
00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the year 2000 was a century year,</v>

1137
00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:58.120
<v Speaker 1>which normally would not have a leap </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

1138
00:58:58.810 --> 00:59:02.170
<v Speaker 1>except it's a century year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evenly divisible by 400.</v>

1139
00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:06.970
<v Speaker 1>So they put the leap day back in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody on February,</v>

1140
00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:07.803
<v Speaker 1>almost everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody except the astronomers on </v>

1141
00:59:09.551 --> 00:59:10.384
<v Speaker 1>February 29th in the year 2000 set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a leap year because it's </v>

1142
00:59:13.511 --> 00:59:15.340
<v Speaker 1>divisible by four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1143
00:59:16.140 --> 00:59:16.973
<v Speaker 1>it is a rarely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pierre is a century year divisible by </v>

1144
00:59:20.501 --> 00:59:21.334
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

1145
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:25.003
<v Speaker 1>That corrects it back and so now you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a stable calendar for tens of </v>

1146
00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:29.533
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to give props to the Jesuit </v>

1147
00:59:31.521 --> 00:59:34.070
<v Speaker 1>priest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say no.</v>

1148
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:34.904
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking the Christianity out of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>reference because they figured out the </v>

1149
00:59:36.981 --> 00:59:40.010
<v Speaker 1>calendar that we all use and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking awesome count.</v>

1150
00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:40.853
<v Speaker 1>Sorry to drop an F bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had so I'm not just because some </v>

1151
00:59:44.001 --> 00:59:47.450
<v Speaker 1>atheist are telling me that God had </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in the universe that to.</v>

1152
00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:49.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>

1153
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:50.323
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say they came up with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>calendar for the reasons were because </v>

1154
00:59:54.141 --> 00:59:55.790
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want to confuse it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With Passover.</v>

1155
00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:56.773
<v Speaker 1>The motivation is whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the science is is good and so there </v>

1156
01:00:00.171 --> 01:00:01.760
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So intercessory to war,</v>

1157
01:00:01.761 --> 01:00:04.700
<v Speaker 1>where we go back many centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the editor said,</v>

1158
01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:05.534
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should use bcg because there's a </v>

1159
01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:07.123
<v Speaker 1>liberal forward.</v>

1160
01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I'd say I am not using BC and see get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way there was no year zero.</v>

1161
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:15.283
<v Speaker 1>You know why there's no year zero?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the Romans came up with the </v>

1162
01:00:16.971 --> 01:00:19.310
<v Speaker 1>calendar and they counted using Roman </v>
<v Speaker 1>numerals.</v>

1163
01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Roman numerals don't have a zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was not yet invented.</v>

1164
01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have a zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1165
01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:27.643
<v Speaker 1>So it went from one BC to add one BC </v>
<v Speaker 1>before Christ and his anno Domini in </v>

1166
01:00:33.561 --> 01:00:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Latin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the year of our Lord.</v>

1167
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1168
01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.740
<v Speaker 1>of course in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Islam and in China,</v>

1169
01:00:39.741 --> 01:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>and in a and Hebrew cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1170
01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:44.283
<v Speaker 1>Israel in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have access to the Chinese </v>

1171
01:00:46.971 --> 01:00:48.320
<v Speaker 1>calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Muslim calendar,</v>

1172
01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Muslim of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dates to Mohammed Chinese calendar dates</v>

1173
01:00:51.561 --> 01:00:56.561
<v Speaker 1>to actually a planetary alignment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>4,700</v>

1174
01:00:56.871 --> 01:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

1175
01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.560
<v Speaker 1>they use a different system where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>use a different system.</v>

1176
01:01:00.561 --> 01:01:03.740
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Hebrew calendar dates too,</v>

1177
01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.510
<v Speaker 1>like the beginning of the universe as </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpreted in the,</v>

1178
01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:08.453
<v Speaker 1>in the Torah.</v>

1179
01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:09.553
<v Speaker 1>So they have access to those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when the conducting international </v>

1180
01:01:11.961 --> 01:01:12.794
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just simply use the Gregorian </v>

1181
01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:15.680
<v Speaker 1>calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get over it,</v>

1182
01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:16.963
<v Speaker 1>but use it in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they use it constantly and </v>

1183
01:01:18.981 --> 01:01:19.814
<v Speaker 1>consistently or do they alternate </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the Gregorian calendar and </v>

1184
01:01:22.161 --> 01:01:22.900
<v Speaker 1>something else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1185
01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:23.733
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a Chinese expert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from what I know of China and my </v>

1186
01:01:25.131 --> 01:01:28.220
<v Speaker 1>friends and colleagues that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>conducting business,</v>

1187
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:29.323
<v Speaker 1>the world's business is conducted in on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gregorian calendar with a 12 month </v>

1188
01:01:32.301 --> 01:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>calendar with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the year as referenced by everybody</v>

1189
01:01:36.771 --> 01:01:39.830
<v Speaker 1>else and does it have to be done that </v>
<v Speaker 1>way in terms of like is there.</v>

1190
01:01:39.831 --> 01:01:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Has anyone ever done a study on possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating a more effective,</v>

1191
01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.073
<v Speaker 1>more accurate calendar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't invoke leap years and the </v>

1192
01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:49.124
<v Speaker 1>problem is the length of the day does </v>
<v Speaker 1>not cut evenly to the time it takes </v>

1193
01:01:55.071 --> 01:01:55.904
<v Speaker 1>earth to go around the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they'll always be fractions of days </v>

1194
01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:01.460
<v Speaker 1>that you're accumulating and now what do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do with them?</v>

1195
01:02:01.461 --> 01:02:04.070
<v Speaker 1>You wait until your accumulated day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you put it in or take it out.</v>

1196
01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:07.150
<v Speaker 1>What did the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not this lunar cycle calendar,</v>

1197
01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>but it was an accountant who is based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venus and so yeah,</v>

1198
01:02:11.121 --> 01:02:11.954
<v Speaker 1>that a really good calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was overstated that it was like </v>

1199
01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:16.480
<v Speaker 1>really accurate calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overstate,</v>

1200
01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.720
<v Speaker 1>overstate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was good.</v>

1201
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Better than anything that came before </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1202
01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:20.150
<v Speaker 1>Not as good as the.</v>

1203
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.701
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1204
01:02:20.701 --> 01:02:21.210
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

1205
01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Green County people love old shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1206
01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:26.100
<v Speaker 2>They do and they want to believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially people who,</v>

1207
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:29.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to believe the people 5,000</v>

1208
01:02:29.431 --> 01:02:33.270
<v Speaker 2>years ago somehow knew more about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>university that we do to just know why.</v>

1209
01:02:33.271 --> 01:02:35.670
<v Speaker 2>Is that why they wanted to believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1210
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:38.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

1211
01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.040
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the great puzzles of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of life.</v>

1212
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:42.263
<v Speaker 2>Why do people want to believe that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egyptian somehow had some access to the </v>

1213
01:02:46.771 --> 01:02:47.521
<v Speaker 2>universe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1214
01:02:47.521 --> 01:02:48.930
<v Speaker 2>they knew some money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They cool.</v>

1215
01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:52.130
<v Speaker 2>They definitely knew how to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible shit horse,</v>

1216
01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:56.010
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I don't want to take that away from</v>

1217
01:02:56.011 --> 01:02:57.570
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't the physical,</v>

1218
01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.673
<v Speaker 2>just the presence of these incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>buildings leave the possibility that </v>

1219
01:03:03.361 --> 01:03:05.100
<v Speaker 2>maybe they had some knowledge that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost.</v>

1220
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:11.190
<v Speaker 2>Lost knowledge is a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to belittle or diminish the</v>

1221
01:03:11.191 --> 01:03:12.330
<v Speaker 2>significance of real knowledge.</v>

1222
01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.640
<v Speaker 2>We forgot how to draw in perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1223
01:03:14.641 --> 01:03:17.220
<v Speaker 2>from ancient times had to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>rediscovered in the,</v>

1224
01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:21.330
<v Speaker 2>as I understand from the artists had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be rediscovered in the renaissance.</v>

1225
01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the archway,</v>

1226
01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:26.730
<v Speaker 2>the Roman arch had to sort of be </v>
<v Speaker 2>rediscovered.</v>

1227
01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1228
01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:30.570
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1229
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:33.630
<v Speaker 2>you can lose knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at the knowledge we have</v>

1230
01:03:33.631 --> 01:03:37.350
<v Speaker 2>gleaned using the methods and modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>methods and tools of science that go far</v>

1231
01:03:37.351 --> 01:03:38.184
<v Speaker 2>beyond our five senses in our access to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world to say that somehow they knew </v>

1232
01:03:43.471 --> 01:03:46.800
<v Speaker 2>something that we don't using our tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just false.</v>

1233
01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just.</v>

1234
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:49.833
<v Speaker 2>It's just not possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we know the physiological limits of </v>

1235
01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:57.350
<v Speaker 2>your ability to know what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>around you and then people say,</v>

1236
01:03:57.351 --> 01:03:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a sixth sense fine,</v>

1237
01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:02.730
<v Speaker 2>but as a scientist I have dozens of </v>
<v Speaker 2>senses.</v>

1238
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:04.013
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can measure things that your five </v>

1239
01:04:04.951 --> 01:04:05.820
<v Speaker 2>senses can't.</v>

1240
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.860
<v Speaker 2>I can measure the magnetic field around </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1241
01:04:07.861 --> 01:04:10.650
<v Speaker 2>the electromagnetic field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much microwaves are coursing through</v>

1242
01:04:10.651 --> 01:04:12.930
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we have no sensors for this.</v>

1243
01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:15.240
<v Speaker 2>I can see auras.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

1244
01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.240
<v Speaker 2>I can see other things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>affecting your body.</v>

1245
01:04:18.241 --> 01:04:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Now I can tell you if ionizing radiation</v>
<v Speaker 2>is passing through you,</v>

1246
01:04:21.721 --> 01:04:23.760
<v Speaker 2>I've geiger counters that can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

1247
01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:24.683
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find that you will eventually </v>

1248
01:04:25.531 --> 01:04:29.870
<v Speaker 2>learn whether you were exposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ionizing radiation because you're.</v>

1249
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:32.640
<v Speaker 2>You'll get cancer of your organs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your limbs fall off.</v>

1250
01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:33.563
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can see that we know far more today </v>

1251
01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:36.950
<v Speaker 2>perhaps at any.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1252
01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:40.650
<v Speaker 2>not even perhaps than at any other time </v>
<v Speaker 2>in conceivable history.</v>

1253
01:04:40.651 --> 01:04:41.484
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is possible that they knew some </v>

1254
01:04:43.891 --> 01:04:46.710
<v Speaker 2>things like how to build a pyramid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1255
01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:49.050
<v Speaker 2>That we really just don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

1256
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it means to not </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand how to build a pyramid.</v>

1257
01:04:53.731 --> 01:04:54.770
<v Speaker 2>Today we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>

1258
01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:58.560
<v Speaker 2>we have 150 story building,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we are thinking about pyramid stuff.</v>

1259
01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:00.960
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know whether it's the first thing</v>

1260
01:05:00.961 --> 01:05:04.200
<v Speaker 2>that was built by humans ever?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1261
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:06.330
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only part of the sentence.</v>

1262
01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:09.143
<v Speaker 2>I love your enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My sentence only barely came out of my </v>

1263
01:05:11.701 --> 01:05:16.701
<v Speaker 2>mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tallest thing humans built after the</v>

1264
01:05:16.741 --> 01:05:20.170
<v Speaker 2>pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a building in Dubai.</v>

1265
01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.570
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>

1266
01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:25.540
<v Speaker 2>tell this thing after the pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1267
01:05:25.541 --> 01:05:26.800
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After w.</v>

1268
01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:30.280
<v Speaker 2>What is the next hottest thing we built?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stable structure after the pyramids.</v>

1269
01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:32.830
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Eiffel Tower?</v>

1270
01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.740
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>18.</v>

1271
01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:36.790
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 89.</v>

1272
01:05:36.791 --> 01:05:37.331
<v Speaker 2>18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday,</v>

1273
01:05:37.331 --> 01:05:40.150
<v Speaker 2>late 18 hundreds in Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Eiffel Tower.</v>

1274
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:41.463
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the first stable structure we </v>

1275
01:05:43.571 --> 01:05:47.410
<v Speaker 2>built as a civilization that was taller </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the pyramids,</v>

1276
01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:50.800
<v Speaker 2>so the Egyptians knew how to.</v>

1277
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:51.743
<v Speaker 2>They knew architecture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew no one's taken that away from </v>

1278
01:05:55.241 --> 01:05:56.074
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to claim they have some secret </v>

1279
01:05:57.731 --> 01:05:59.470
<v Speaker 2>knowledge of the functionings of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

1280
01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:00.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1281
01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:03.160
<v Speaker 2>Well people love saying that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1282
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes for great tv,</v>

1283
01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:05.373
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that they didn't have steel</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that we're dealing with at </v>

1284
01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:11.860
<v Speaker 2>the very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very most recent 2,500</v>

1285
01:06:11.861 --> 01:06:16.630
<v Speaker 2>BC and they built.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have to be more ingenious,</v>

1286
01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:19.420
<v Speaker 2>more innovative than we otherwise would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to be.</v>

1287
01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how do you move the blocks?</v>

1288
01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:25.000
<v Speaker 2>How they make stone Henge?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those rocks are nowhere in the region.</v>

1289
01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:26.523
<v Speaker 2>They were carted from sub with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They found a place where those rocks </v>

1290
01:06:28.601 --> 01:06:32.920
<v Speaker 2>were a would have been mined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>removed,</v>

1291
01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:35.800
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are some big ass rocks.</v>

1292
01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:37.053
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As are the ones that's not less </v>

1293
01:06:39.311 --> 01:06:42.030
<v Speaker 2>impressive because they're just big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the.</v>

1294
01:06:42.031 --> 01:06:42.864
<v Speaker 2>The thing about the pyramids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so impressive as the precision and </v>

1295
01:06:45.131 --> 01:06:46.480
<v Speaker 2>the sheer numbers.</v>

1296
01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:49.540
<v Speaker 2>2 million I best 600,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>stones.</v>

1297
01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:54.370
<v Speaker 2>Our best understanding of Stonehenge is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's a functioning observatory that</v>

1298
01:06:54.371 --> 01:06:58.390
<v Speaker 2>can actually predict eclipses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So do I go,</v>

1299
01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:03.880
<v Speaker 2>I just got to bitch slap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not impressive,</v>

1300
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:08.970
<v Speaker 2>impressive lined with the summer </v>
<v Speaker 2>solstice,</v>

1301
01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:11.930
<v Speaker 2>but they have their holes that are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>stones,</v>

1302
01:07:11.931 --> 01:07:15.790
<v Speaker 2>but they're 56 holes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is three times the Cerros,</v>

1303
01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.633
<v Speaker 2>which is the cycle of eclipses of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>matching of the orbits of the Sun and </v>

1304
01:07:20.331 --> 01:07:22.670
<v Speaker 2>the moon in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pants or the sun and the moon in the</v>

1305
01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:25.010
<v Speaker 2>sky and when they match up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get into clips.</v>

1306
01:07:25.130 --> 01:07:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Is there is an eclipse observatory guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>named.</v>

1307
01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:28.093
<v Speaker 2>That's absolutely what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a book published and in the 19 </v>

1308
01:07:31.311 --> 01:07:36.311
<v Speaker 2>seventies by guy named David Dawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Dawkins was another one of these</v>

1309
01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.700
<v Speaker 2>hawkings written Richard Hawkins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard Hawkins,</v>

1310
01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.980
<v Speaker 2>hawking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hawking hockings.</v>

1311
01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Damn what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn well.</v>

1312
01:07:48.201 --> 01:07:51.350
<v Speaker 2>We've got our top crack researchers here</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to look up.</v>

1313
01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.240
<v Speaker 2>The title of his book was Stonehenge </v>
<v Speaker 2>decoded.</v>

1314
01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:55.010
<v Speaker 2>Just look up the title of that book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyhow,</v>

1315
01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:56.063
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's highly convincing and we all were </v>

1316
01:07:57.411 --> 01:07:58.710
<v Speaker 2>all there with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

1317
01:07:58.720 --> 01:07:59.553
<v Speaker 2>it's essentially just a study of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>position of the stones in relationship </v>

1318
01:08:02.751 --> 01:08:05.180
<v Speaker 2>to the where the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1319
01:08:05.181 --> 01:08:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Gerald,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gerald Hawkins.</v>

1320
01:08:06.261 --> 01:08:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here we go.</v>

1321
01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stonehenge decoded.</v>

1322
01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:09.673
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I visited Stonehenge as a kid at age 15 </v>

1323
01:08:13.491 --> 01:08:15.860
<v Speaker 2>on an expedition and he was expedition </v>
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

1324
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how lucky for you.</v>

1325
01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:19.473
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1326
01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:22.010
<v Speaker 2>it was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that stuck with me,</v>

1327
01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:22.873
<v Speaker 2>which is why I named this phenomenon in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan where the sun sets along the </v>

1328
01:08:26.530 --> 01:08:28.940
<v Speaker 2>stress on your instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1329
01:08:28.941 --> 01:08:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1330
01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:30.643
<v Speaker 2>so I named that Manhattan Henge sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearkening back to my early days </v>

1331
01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.433
<v Speaker 2>thinking about the alignment of the sun </v>
<v Speaker 2>and structures that we might build </v>

1332
01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:40.653
<v Speaker 2>because so twice a year for those </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewers or listeners who don't know </v>

1333
01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:43.993
<v Speaker 2>twice a year to Manhattan street grid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not perfectly aligned north </v>

1334
01:08:47.631 --> 01:08:49.580
<v Speaker 2>south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Manhattan Street Grid,</v>

1335
01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:50.763
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will the sun will set exactly on the </v>

1336
01:08:53.031 --> 01:08:55.490
<v Speaker 2>grid and in grid and what's up there.</v>

1337
01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that image,</v>

1338
01:08:56.991 --> 01:08:57.824
<v Speaker 2>what's not obvious is that picture is </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken along a street that is itself </v>

1339
01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:07.190
<v Speaker 2>three miles long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're crossing a,</v>

1340
01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:08.163
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Hudson River and then there's New </v>

1341
01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:12.440
<v Speaker 2>Jersey on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so people try to zoom in on it.</v>

1342
01:09:12.441 --> 01:09:13.274
<v Speaker 2>But really what you really should do is </v>
<v Speaker 2>zoom out from it and then you get the </v>

1343
01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:20.240
<v Speaker 2>vanishing point on itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those are zoomed,</v>

1344
01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:22.190
<v Speaker 2>zoomed in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1345
01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:23.570
<v Speaker 2>let's go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1346
01:09:23.571 --> 01:09:25.520
<v Speaker 2>that one looks more like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like my photo.</v>

1347
01:09:25.521 --> 01:09:27.980
<v Speaker 2>I go back to that other one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1348
01:09:28.010 --> 01:09:28.800
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1349
01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.220
<v Speaker 2>so that's on 34th street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one you see now.</v>

1350
01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.160
<v Speaker 2>And then you get this sparkling effect </v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens twice a year.</v>

1351
01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:37.760
<v Speaker 2>That sort of crazy wild light effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1352
01:09:37.761 --> 01:09:40.250
<v Speaker 2>It looks photoshop dolls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1353
01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:41.323
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an image on his instagram that </v>

1354
01:09:43.971 --> 01:09:46.820
<v Speaker 2>is linked on my instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most recent photo.</v>

1355
01:09:46.830 --> 01:09:47.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>

1356
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's you with the sound selfish.</v>

1357
01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.670
<v Speaker 2>So come on down the Afro though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1358
01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:54.440
<v Speaker 2>that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was my first cell phone.</v>

1359
01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:57.490
<v Speaker 2>I was a 14 for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see.</v>

1360
01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.540
<v Speaker 2>It was 19,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably 1974.</v>

1361
01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would have been 15.</v>

1362
01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:07.640
<v Speaker 2>I think I've been 14 or 15 year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Path of curiosity was set back.</v>

1363
01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:09.470
<v Speaker 2>It goes back very early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1364
01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the one we're looking for</v>

1365
01:10:11.151 --> 01:10:12.530
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go on that one.</v>

1366
01:10:12.531 --> 01:10:17.531
<v Speaker 2>Thinking it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that is another one where the guys go</v>

1367
01:10:17.691 --> 01:10:19.380
<v Speaker 2>back to all of them into rivers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wild.</v>

1368
01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Zoom back out to you see all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures.</v>

1369
01:10:21.201 --> 01:10:23.600
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the bottom left.</v>

1370
01:10:23.601 --> 01:10:24.500
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1371
01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:29.860
<v Speaker 2>That might be the first ever Manhattan </v>
<v Speaker 2>Henge photo out from A.</v>

1372
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:31.603
<v Speaker 2>I took that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it got published in 2002 before </v>

1373
01:10:35.121 --> 01:10:36.710
<v Speaker 2>September 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is July.</v>

1374
01:10:36.711 --> 01:10:38.420
<v Speaker 2>I took it before September 11th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1375
01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:42.500
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I had a means to publish it and</v>

1376
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:43.423
<v Speaker 2>right then the notice that it's a green </v>
<v Speaker 2>light and traffic is ready to knock me </v>

1377
01:10:47.511 --> 01:10:50.780
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no one is in the streets doing this,</v>

1378
01:10:50.781 --> 01:10:51.614
<v Speaker 2>but now are tens of thousands of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that pour into the streets on these </v>

1379
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:55.243
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We post what day you're getting </v>

1380
01:10:56.031 --> 01:10:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan hinge from the American Museum</v>
<v Speaker 2>of natural history.</v>

1381
01:10:58.790 --> 01:11:00.710
<v Speaker 2>My Day job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that goes out.</v>

1382
01:11:00.711 --> 01:11:01.544
<v Speaker 2>The press gets it and tens of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people spilling into the street </v>

1383
01:11:04.821 --> 01:11:07.670
<v Speaker 2>blocking traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you think of all the ways traffic</v>

1384
01:11:07.671 --> 01:11:09.660
<v Speaker 2>gets blocked in your day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1385
01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 2>is all it was too many of</v>

1386
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:14.910
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You by yourself.</v>

1387
01:11:14.911 --> 01:11:16.050
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

1388
01:11:16.051 --> 01:11:17.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what it has become.</v>

1389
01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Holding up phones and it's all because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to stonehenge.</v>

1390
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

1391
01:11:21.930 --> 01:11:23.790
<v Speaker 1>it's also a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an observatory.</v>

1392
01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Was it you that name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This damn check you out coins.</v>

1393
01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.073
<v Speaker 1>Coins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say coin minted Manhattan hinge </v>

1394
01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.753
<v Speaker 1>because the buildings are like hinges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hinges of stone as a vertical stone </v>

1395
01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:37.290
<v Speaker 1>is a vertical structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you made a stone,</v>

1396
01:11:37.291 --> 01:11:38.124
<v Speaker 1>it's a stone henge why isn't it possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>to construct a calendar that doesn't </v>

1397
01:11:42.301 --> 01:11:45.330
<v Speaker 1>have leap years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you would have to do,</v>

1398
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:46.223
<v Speaker 1>you could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what would happen is it means you </v>

1399
01:11:48.451 --> 01:11:50.850
<v Speaker 1>care more about the year than you do </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the day.</v>

1400
01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:52.613
<v Speaker 1>So what would happen is you would </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrate the new year at like three in </v>

1401
01:11:55.831 --> 01:11:58.440
<v Speaker 1>the afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1402
01:11:58.890 --> 01:11:59.723
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the next year you'd celebrate </v>

1403
01:12:00.631 --> 01:12:05.631
<v Speaker 1>it at like 12 minutes after three in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>afternoon and then 20 minutes you would,</v>

1404
01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:07.523
<v Speaker 1>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would sort of move through your </v>

1405
01:12:09.571 --> 01:12:14.571
<v Speaker 1>calendar and then that means you cared </v>
<v Speaker 1>more about the year that you care more.</v>

1406
01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:17.910
<v Speaker 1>About the two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say that right.</v>

1407
01:12:18.210 --> 01:12:19.043
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always want to celebrate new year's </v>

1408
01:12:21.181 --> 01:12:22.980
<v Speaker 1>on midnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

1409
01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:25.800
<v Speaker 1>New Year's is celebrated in 24 time </v>
<v Speaker 1>zones.</v>

1410
01:12:25.801 --> 01:12:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Not all at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting.</v>

1411
01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:32.930
<v Speaker 1>Everyone thinks of that as a moment yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a calendar event.</v>

1412
01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:36.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a talk event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's celebrated over 24 hours.</v>

1413
01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in Thailand,</v>

1414
01:12:37.681 --> 01:12:39.630
<v Speaker 1>it's 14 hours difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So therefore,</v>

1415
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.790
<v Speaker 1>if you were to do an astrophysical </v>
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>

1416
01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:42.923
<v Speaker 1>you would know the exact moment where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>returned in our orbit and everybody </v>

1417
01:12:46.921 --> 01:12:49.890
<v Speaker 1>would celebrate that instant in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be.</v>

1418
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.860
<v Speaker 1>So then the whole world was celebrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new year at the same time.</v>

1419
01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:56.760
<v Speaker 1>That means you value it differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a midnight celebration.</v>

1420
01:12:56.761 --> 01:12:58.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do that.</v>

1421
01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:00.630
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less so celestial.</v>

1422
01:13:00.631 --> 01:13:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

1423
01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.530
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1424
01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:05.393
<v Speaker 1>that's the only way [inaudible] a day </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't cut evenly into the year that </v>

1425
01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:10.200
<v Speaker 1>those two have nothing to do with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

1426
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:12.600
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason why that would have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

1427
01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:13.830
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1428
01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:15.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in other words,</v>

1429
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.433
<v Speaker 1>let me say it another way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because you're looking like you're </v>

1430
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.620
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1431
01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:23.130
<v Speaker 1>you're looking off in space here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's new year's.</v>

1432
01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's count 365 days when we do that.</v>

1433
01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:34.460
<v Speaker 1>We are not at the same place we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we left.</v>

1434
01:13:34.651 --> 01:13:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Celebrated New Year's Day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Year's Eve.</v>

1435
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.333
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not at the same place in our </v>

1436
01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:41.800
<v Speaker 1>orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A revolution around.</v>

1437
01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:44.510
<v Speaker 1>You rotate on an axis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You revolve around something else.</v>

1438
01:13:44.511 --> 01:13:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Since I was two words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you use those two words.</v>

1439
01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:50.100
<v Speaker 1>So we're not in the same place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we celebrate new year's anyway.</v>

1440
01:13:50.730 --> 01:13:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when will we be in the same place?</v>

1441
01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:56.070
<v Speaker 1>A quarter of a day later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six hours.</v>

1442
01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:00.030
<v Speaker 1>So we would celebrate the next new year </v>
<v Speaker 1>at 6:00</v>

1443
01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:01.540
<v Speaker 1>AM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's willing to do that.</v>

1444
01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.660
<v Speaker 1>That was really the end of the next new </v>
<v Speaker 1>year at noon,</v>

1445
01:14:03.850 --> 01:14:05.670
<v Speaker 1>the next few year at six PM.</v>

1446
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:08.910
<v Speaker 1>And then the next few years kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>aligns back again.</v>

1447
01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the leap day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the fourth year we have put in.</v>

1448
01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh See.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's our love of the day.</v>

1449
01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:17.343
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That keeps us fucked up with the world </v>

1450
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:23.060
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1451
01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:24.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1452
01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:25.283
<v Speaker 1>You pick one and then that's how.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you do it and what do the </v>

1453
01:14:28.421 --> 01:14:30.070
<v Speaker 1>minds based it on the moon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1454
01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:31.503
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get a cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't study their calendar as deeply </v>

1455
01:14:34.511 --> 01:14:35.344
<v Speaker 1>as I should have and wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially back in 2012 and everyone </v>

1456
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:39.161
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1457
01:14:39.161 --> 01:14:39.994
<v Speaker 1>the Mayan calendar runs out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so therefore that's the end of the </v>

1458
01:14:41.201 --> 01:14:42.130
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>

1459
01:14:44.660 --> 01:14:48.900
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking it was the end of the war</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the mindsets are the mindsets.</v>

1460
01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.320
<v Speaker 1>That was back when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1461
01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:56.400
<v Speaker 1>before that had happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was George Bush was president in 2007</v>

1462
01:14:56.891 --> 01:14:58.360
<v Speaker 1>and everybody was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

1463
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:59.223
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

1464
01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.810
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be the end of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

1465
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:04.180
<v Speaker 1>So every decade there's somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicting the end of the world.</v>

1466
01:15:04.190 --> 01:15:05.023
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually quite entertained by this </v>

1467
01:15:06.341 --> 01:15:08.440
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when they had billboards</v>

1468
01:15:08.441 --> 01:15:11.470
<v Speaker 1>all around la?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a few years that that's a different</v>

1469
01:15:11.471 --> 01:15:15.730
<v Speaker 1>end of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a guy with a radio podcast church</v>

1470
01:15:16.110 --> 01:15:16.943
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the underworld didn't come and </v>

1471
01:15:19.721 --> 01:15:21.130
<v Speaker 1>so they pushed it forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

1472
01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.080
<v Speaker 1>it's entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in a free country.</v>

1473
01:15:23.110 --> 01:15:23.943
<v Speaker 1>It's evidenced that we live in a free </v>
<v Speaker 1>country where freedom of speech is </v>

1474
01:15:28.211 --> 01:15:30.670
<v Speaker 1>protected and you can practice any </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion you want,</v>

1475
01:15:30.910 --> 01:15:31.743
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>

1476
01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:32.593
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't learn much science in </v>

1477
01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:35.860
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a part of it.</v>

1478
01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:38.320
<v Speaker 1>That's part of the fact that you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this in our world.</v>

1479
01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:41.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind it actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it entertaining,</v>

1480
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:46.950
<v Speaker 1>but it becomes an issue if people such </v>
<v Speaker 1>as that gain power over legislation over</v>

1481
01:15:47.981 --> 01:15:48.814
<v Speaker 1>the rest of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this would count this as a </v>

1482
01:15:50.411 --> 01:15:51.244
<v Speaker 1>personal belief.</v>

1483
01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:52.233
<v Speaker 1>It's your personal belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world is going to end on October </v>

1484
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:56.220
<v Speaker 1>19th in the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's your,</v>

1485
01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:57.970
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fine.</v>

1486
01:15:58.140 --> 01:16:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you now create laws that require,</v>

1487
01:16:01.001 --> 01:16:01.834
<v Speaker 1>I go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just impose your personal belief on </v>

1488
01:16:04.181 --> 01:16:09.181
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your personal belief is not true for</v>

1489
01:16:09.461 --> 01:16:10.900
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only true for you.</v>

1490
01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:12.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>

1491
01:16:12.341 --> 01:16:13.174
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And an objective truth is true for </v>

1492
01:16:13.841 --> 01:16:15.160
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're gonna have,</v>

1493
01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:16.053
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to have governance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to want a base governance </v>

1494
01:16:18.881 --> 01:16:19.714
<v Speaker 1>on what is objectively true because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>would apply to everyone the independent </v>

1495
01:16:23.531 --> 01:16:24.364
<v Speaker 1>of your belief system.</v>

1496
01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with that.</v>

1497
01:16:29.140 --> 01:16:30.520
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>

1498
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:34.900
<v Speaker 1>There are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are things that we're not sure are</v>

1499
01:16:34.901 --> 01:16:35.734
<v Speaker 1>true yet that we're still researching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I'm talking about as an </v>

1500
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:43.180
<v Speaker 1>as an objective truth check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your truth had been verified by multiple</v>

1501
01:16:43.181 --> 01:16:45.610
<v Speaker 1>scientific studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just one study.</v>

1502
01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:48.790
<v Speaker 1>This was the problem with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol study.</v>

1503
01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:50.003
<v Speaker 1>This is a cholesterol study that said </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody on the course to drop their </v>

1504
01:16:52.211 --> 01:16:53.800
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1505
01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:56.680
<v Speaker 1>saying it would be good for your heart </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the rest of this,</v>

1506
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.903
<v Speaker 1>because a series of countries were </v>
<v Speaker 1>studied where they have longevity and </v>

1507
01:17:01.031 --> 01:17:01.864
<v Speaker 1>low heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low heart disease and low cholesterol </v>

1508
01:17:03.161 --> 01:17:05.800
<v Speaker 1>intake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That study happened to leave out France.</v>

1509
01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:09.980
<v Speaker 1>It happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't in the study and a couple</v>

1510
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.640
<v Speaker 2>of other places that have high </v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol intake but don't have higher</v>

1511
01:17:13.641 --> 01:17:17.660
<v Speaker 2>heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that study was flawed,</v>

1512
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:19.303
<v Speaker 2>but it was hard to replicate it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it went over many years and it was </v>

1513
01:17:21.501 --> 01:17:24.680
<v Speaker 2>thousands of people and so everyone just</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumped on it.</v>

1514
01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:27.510
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a scientific truth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1515
01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.393
<v Speaker 2>This is a general problem with medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>results because the press is waiting at </v>

1516
01:17:32.121 --> 01:17:32.954
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the,</v>

1517
01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:36.590
<v Speaker 2>at the Journal Editors Office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1518
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:39.710
<v Speaker 2>here's a new study that shows that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives you cancer.</v>

1519
01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that must be true.</v>

1520
01:17:41.151 --> 01:17:41.984
<v Speaker 2>And outcomes the headline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you want to be the first to </v>

1521
01:17:42.861 --> 01:17:43.694
<v Speaker 2>report it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then that gets emblazoned in </v>

1522
01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:47.360
<v Speaker 2>people's heads and not everyone reads </v>
<v Speaker 2>the followup.</v>

1523
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:51.200
<v Speaker 2>No one could duplicate that study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one.</v>

1524
01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:54.530
<v Speaker 2>So there's a flaw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't even know what the flaw is.</v>

1525
01:17:54.531 --> 01:17:56.870
<v Speaker 2>We know that no one else could get those</v>
<v Speaker 2>results.</v>

1526
01:17:57.830 --> 01:18:01.190
<v Speaker 2>So it goes in the dustbin of scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>

1527
01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:02.173
<v Speaker 2>Most research in any journal of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment will ultimately shown to be </v>

1528
01:18:06.111 --> 01:18:09.200
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the bleeding edge of science.</v>

1529
01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:10.853
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a great place to be because you're </v>

1530
01:18:12.111 --> 01:18:12.944
<v Speaker 2>in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in the trenches and you don't </v>

1531
01:18:14.181 --> 01:18:15.014
<v Speaker 2>know what is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't look up in the back of the </v>

1532
01:18:16.821 --> 01:18:20.810
<v Speaker 2>book what the answer is to double check.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even know what the question is</v>

1533
01:18:20.811 --> 01:18:23.860
<v Speaker 2>to ask half the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1534
01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:27.890
<v Speaker 2>but that's very frustrating for people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't get it.</v>

1535
01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:29.540
<v Speaker 2>Correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's exciting.</v>

1536
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:33.250
<v Speaker 2>It's exciting for the scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exciting to knowledge period that's</v>

1537
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.333
<v Speaker 2>constantly expanding and growing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a very frustrating for people </v>

1538
01:18:36.951 --> 01:18:39.140
<v Speaker 2>that really don't have the time and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1539
01:18:39.141 --> 01:18:42.890
<v Speaker 2>maybe he did get some outdated nutrition</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge or they need an answer,</v>

1540
01:18:42.891 --> 01:18:43.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1541
01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:44.360
<v Speaker 2>they need an answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1542
01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now.</v>

1543
01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:48.050
<v Speaker 2>And religion in many ways gives you </v>
<v Speaker 2>answers right now.</v>

1544
01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:49.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without the need to sort of have to </v>

1545
01:18:51.330 --> 01:18:52.163
<v Speaker 2>research it or to go on the frontier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lack of education and the lack of </v>

1546
01:18:56.490 --> 01:18:57.323
<v Speaker 2>the lack of curiosity about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the scariest things about </v>

1547
01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:02.030
<v Speaker 2>new generations of kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1548
01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:04.070
<v Speaker 2>Like when the new generations are coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

1549
01:19:04.071 --> 01:19:06.050
<v Speaker 2>if they know less than the generation </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

1550
01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:07.520
<v Speaker 2>that's when we really start to freak </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1551
01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:08.503
<v Speaker 2>That would be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I have good confidence in the </v>

1552
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:14.450
<v Speaker 2>30 and under gender because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>millennial,</v>

1553
01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:17.660
<v Speaker 2>I will have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think millennials have only ever known</v>

1554
01:19:17.661 --> 01:19:21.560
<v Speaker 2>the Internet and devices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what would they say?</v>

1555
01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:22.483
<v Speaker 2>Recent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my son is a millennial and he's </v>

1556
01:19:23.961 --> 01:19:25.880
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my kids are millennials,</v>

1557
01:19:25.881 --> 01:19:28.490
<v Speaker 2>so they're twentyish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 30 is a little old,</v>

1558
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:31.490
<v Speaker 2>so 25 and under I think are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>millennials.</v>

1559
01:19:31.530 --> 01:19:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But 30 when they were 10,</v>

1560
01:19:33.381 --> 01:19:34.340
<v Speaker 2>the Internet was around.</v>

1561
01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:35.203
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they need a different marketing </v>

1562
01:19:35.961 --> 01:19:37.580
<v Speaker 2>terms so you can market to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>

1563
01:19:37.581 --> 01:19:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to me,</v>

1564
01:19:39.321 --> 01:19:41.840
<v Speaker 2>I would put them in the same bin just as</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were thinking there,</v>

1565
01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:43.310
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

1566
01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:47.390
<v Speaker 2>they have a different relationship to </v>
<v Speaker 2>science and technology.</v>

1567
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:48.583
<v Speaker 2>Of course they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't fear the science or the </v>

1568
01:19:50.061 --> 01:19:50.894
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They embrace it because it has shaped </v>

1569
01:19:52.161 --> 01:19:54.560
<v Speaker 2>the civilization that is enabled their </v>
<v Speaker 2>social life.</v>

1570
01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:58.880
<v Speaker 2>It has been through this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things that I tweeted,</v>

1571
01:19:58.910 --> 01:20:01.430
<v Speaker 2>I think it was from scientific American </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday,</v>

1572
01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.350
<v Speaker 2>maybe it was yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1573
01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit misleading,</v>

1574
01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.373
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things they said is only </v>
<v Speaker 2>64 percent of millennials have a strong </v>

1575
01:20:10.561 --> 01:20:11.670
<v Speaker 2>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These things,</v>

1576
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:14.370
<v Speaker 2>these coasters are terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They look great,</v>

1577
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:17.760
<v Speaker 2>but then things stick to the made of </v>
<v Speaker 2>metal.</v>

1578
01:20:18.850 --> 01:20:20.310
<v Speaker 2>A metal coaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1579
01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:21.750
<v Speaker 2>What the hell is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sticks?</v>

1580
01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:22.613
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the issue sticks when it gets </v>

1581
01:20:24.871 --> 01:20:27.570
<v Speaker 2>moisture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know about this,</v>

1582
01:20:27.571 --> 01:20:29.340
<v Speaker 2>where you flip this over and tip it </v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

1583
01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:32.850
<v Speaker 2>And then what happened on that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never do that.</v>

1584
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:34.470
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1585
01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:35.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the pressure.</v>

1586
01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:38.160
<v Speaker 2>The air pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is okay,</v>

1587
01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:42.820
<v Speaker 2>but don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust your science.</v>

1588
01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Your objective truth is 64 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 2>millennials are not,</v>

1589
01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:48.573
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or only 64 percent are convinced that </v>

1590
01:20:51.161 --> 01:20:54.630
<v Speaker 2>the world is a ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world is a circle.</v>

1591
01:20:54.631 --> 01:20:56.080
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

1592
01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:56.923
<v Speaker 2>Is Fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Roid?</v>

1593
01:20:57.170 --> 01:20:58.003
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it's called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1594
01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:58.913
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to see how that question was </v>

1595
01:21:00.090 --> 01:21:00.923
<v Speaker 2>asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if they know that we are ablate </v>

1596
01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:05.340
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is asking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is Earth a ball?</v>

1597
01:21:05.341 --> 01:21:05.881
<v Speaker 2>They'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1598
01:21:05.881 --> 01:21:09.300
<v Speaker 2>we're going blatant ball or a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 2>wider below the equator than,</v>

1599
01:21:09.301 --> 01:21:10.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than at the equator.</v>

1600
01:21:10.351 --> 01:21:12.720
<v Speaker 2>So we're a pear shaped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oblate spheroid,</v>

1601
01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.380
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a pair that you would find </v>
<v Speaker 2>normally if you found that period.</v>

1602
01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:18.420
<v Speaker 2>But like this is fucking pair that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shaped like a ball.</v>

1603
01:21:18.450 --> 01:21:21.180
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these distinctions,</v>

1604
01:21:21.210 --> 01:21:22.043
<v Speaker 2>these differences in measurements are so</v>
<v Speaker 2>small that if you found it on the </v>

1605
01:21:24.991 --> 01:21:26.430
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would say there is a perfect sphere.</v>

1606
01:21:26.490 --> 01:21:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you how,</v>

1607
01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:29.760
<v Speaker 2>how good a sphere it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1608
01:21:29.761 --> 01:21:30.594
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever see the schoolroom Globes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the geographic Globes and you rub </v>

1609
01:21:34.771 --> 01:21:36.470
<v Speaker 2>your finger over in Nepal and you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

1610
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1611
01:21:38.791 --> 01:21:40.580
<v Speaker 2>And you get the rockies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1612
01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.970
<v Speaker 2>that is a gross exaggeration of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1613
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:48.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you realize if you took earth with </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of its mountains,</v>

1614
01:21:48.421 --> 01:21:49.254
<v Speaker 2>valleys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hills and rep and shrunk it down to </v>

1615
01:21:50.611 --> 01:21:51.444
<v Speaker 2>the size of a cue ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be smoother than any qubole </v>

1616
01:21:53.351 --> 01:21:54.184
<v Speaker 2>ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every machine?</v>

1617
01:21:55.630 --> 01:21:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1618
01:21:58.530 --> 01:22:01.220
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about this job.</v>

1619
01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Really chill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen to me.</v>

1620
01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:05.610
<v Speaker 2>You Ready?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1621
01:22:06.150 --> 01:22:06.983
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know the deepest part of Earth's </v>

1622
01:22:07.801 --> 01:22:08.634
<v Speaker 2>crust?</v>

1623
01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:12.060
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Marianas trench off the coast of the</v>

1624
01:22:12.061 --> 01:22:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Philippines in the Pacific Ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the deepest,</v>

1625
01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:17.670
<v Speaker 2>deepest part goes six miles down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1626
01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:18.301
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1627
01:22:18.301 --> 01:22:19.920
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1628
01:22:19.921 --> 01:22:22.370
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking of the depth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

1629
01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:23.211
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1630
01:22:23.211 --> 01:22:26.220
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just access to the deepest part of verse</v>

1631
01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:27.990
<v Speaker 2>crest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The lowest point on her surface.</v>

1632
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:31.020
<v Speaker 2>The Marianas trench right off the coast </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Philippines.</v>

1633
01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:36.320
<v Speaker 2>The highest point on earth surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tip of a k,</v>

1634
01:22:36.421 --> 01:22:39.630
<v Speaker 2>one k,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one or k two,</v>

1635
01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.010
<v Speaker 2>which is Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's k one.</v>

1636
01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:45.730
<v Speaker 2>Why would you name the tallest peak?</v>
<v Speaker 2>K Two.</v>

1637
01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:47.370
<v Speaker 2>It's good to point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

1638
01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a mountain climber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

1639
01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:50.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm just thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1640
01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:53.530
<v Speaker 2>With.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the Himalayan mountains in Nepal.</v>

1641
01:22:54.010 --> 01:22:55.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it in Nepal?</v>

1642
01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:56.920
<v Speaker 2>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1643
01:22:57.010 --> 01:22:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1644
01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:01.390
<v Speaker 2>So now let's say how high up is that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>28,000</v>

1645
01:23:01.391 --> 01:23:03.670
<v Speaker 2>feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like five miles up.</v>

1646
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:05.263
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1647
01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:07.293
<v Speaker 2>The distance between the lowest point on</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth surface and the highest point on </v>

1648
01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:17.380
<v Speaker 2>earth surface is 11 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's here to the comedy store.</v>

1649
01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.990
<v Speaker 2>That is less than the length of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan.</v>

1650
01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are 8,000</v>

1651
01:23:23.201 --> 01:23:24.580
<v Speaker 2>miles in diameter.</v>

1652
01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:30.510
<v Speaker 2>And those two points are very far </v>
<v Speaker 2>separated from one another.</v>

1653
01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:32.093
<v Speaker 2>If you are cosmic giant and you came up </v>
<v Speaker 2>to earth and you rub your finger over </v>

1654
01:23:35.311 --> 01:23:39.990
<v Speaker 2>earth's surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would feel as smooth as a cue ball to</v>

1655
01:23:39.991 --> 01:23:41.730
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1656
01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:42.960
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this,</v>

1657
01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:44.093
<v Speaker 2>in this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a whole chapter called on being </v>

1658
01:23:45.241 --> 01:23:47.760
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is all about.</v>

1659
01:23:47.761 --> 01:23:51.840
<v Speaker 2>This is all about our perception of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>is round and what is not.</v>

1660
01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:55.320
<v Speaker 2>I had asked you to debate one of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>flat earth guys.</v>

1661
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:55.851
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1662
01:23:55.851 --> 01:23:56.730
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1663
01:23:56.770 --> 01:23:57.603
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about it and we're gonna have </v>

1664
01:23:59.431 --> 01:24:01.470
<v Speaker 2>them on skype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not what we do is,</v>

1665
01:24:01.471 --> 01:24:05.970
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is a diabolical plot so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the next time we can ship people en</v>

1666
01:24:05.971 --> 01:24:06.804
<v Speaker 2>mass into orbit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all want to be the first in line </v>

1667
01:24:08.311 --> 01:24:09.330
<v Speaker 2>because they know we're going to send </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1668
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.823
<v Speaker 2>So if they can see the round earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be the first ones in </v>

1669
01:24:12.121 --> 01:24:15.050
<v Speaker 2>space just so they can stop annoying the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of.</v>

1670
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:19.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're correct,</v>

1671
01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:19.933
<v Speaker 2>but everything's a diabolical plot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do have people that have met that </v>

1672
01:24:22.351 --> 01:24:23.184
<v Speaker 2>don't believe because they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with youtube videos is that </v>

1673
01:24:27.690 --> 01:24:28.523
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem with a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things about being </v>

1674
01:24:30.481 --> 01:24:33.900
<v Speaker 2>unchecked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why you are discussing things is you can</v>

1675
01:24:33.901 --> 01:24:35.190
<v Speaker 2>say things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can use,</v>

1676
01:24:35.191 --> 01:24:36.024
<v Speaker 2>big words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can sound articulate and smooth and </v>

1677
01:24:38.281 --> 01:24:42.660
<v Speaker 2>you can do it and a very professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking manner or do it passionately,</v>

1678
01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:43.933
<v Speaker 2>passionately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>convincingly charismatically and you </v>

1679
01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:48.683
<v Speaker 2>your unchecked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you did that in front of an </v>

1680
01:24:50.911 --> 01:24:54.180
<v Speaker 2>expert and you showed them that along </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

1681
01:24:54.181 --> 01:24:55.020
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

1682
01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:56.280
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

1683
01:24:56.281 --> 01:24:59.070
<v Speaker 2>That's not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me show you why this is incorrect.</v>

1684
01:24:59.250 --> 01:25:02.730
<v Speaker 2>Let me show you how you could prove that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is incorrect or objective truths,</v>

1685
01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:03.653
<v Speaker 2>but this is not happening to render your</v>
<v Speaker 2>argument invalid so people don't have </v>

1686
01:25:06.421 --> 01:25:09.300
<v Speaker 2>any education and then they watch one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these youtube clips.</v>

1687
01:25:09.630 --> 01:25:13.320
<v Speaker 2>They start actually believing that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff makes sense because it's unchecked</v>

1688
01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:15.630
<v Speaker 2>and I would say it's not about whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've had education.</v>

1689
01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:16.613
<v Speaker 2>It's about whether the education they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had teaches them skepticism of </v>

1690
01:25:19.951 --> 01:25:22.710
<v Speaker 2>information and teach them how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>inquire.</v>

1691
01:25:23.050 --> 01:25:28.050
<v Speaker 2>You realize it's just as intellectually </v>
<v Speaker 2>lazy to believe everything you see as it</v>

1692
01:25:29.221 --> 01:25:33.150
<v Speaker 2>is to deny everything you see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1693
01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:38.180
<v Speaker 2>Why should someone know automatically </v>
<v Speaker 2>that earth isn't flat yet?</v>

1694
01:25:39.091 --> 01:25:39.924
<v Speaker 2>I tell them in the next breath that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire universe was once a small as a </v>

1695
01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:43.704
<v Speaker 2>marble,</v>

1696
01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:48.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both of those sound equally preposterous</v>

1697
01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:49.743
<v Speaker 2>except one has evidence to back it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the other does not and very strong </v>

1698
01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:56.980
<v Speaker 2>scientific theoretical and experimental </v>
<v Speaker 2>underpinnings.</v>

1699
01:25:57.490 --> 01:25:58.323
<v Speaker 2>So when you are trained to inquire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't either believe everything </v>

1700
01:26:02.621 --> 01:26:06.290
<v Speaker 2>outright or reject everything outright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trained to ask questions.</v>

1701
01:26:07.190 --> 01:26:11.450
<v Speaker 2>You trained to probe deeper than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>layer of information that comes to you.</v>

1702
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:15.460
<v Speaker 2>That's what should be taught in school </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not you.</v>

1703
01:26:15.710 --> 01:26:19.970
<v Speaker 2>They give you a book and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn this and you'll get tested on it,</v>

1704
01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:21.313
<v Speaker 2>and then when you're done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn this isn't also there's a problem </v>

1705
01:26:23.931 --> 01:26:28.580
<v Speaker 2>with being inexorably connected to your </v>
<v Speaker 2>first belief to you.</v>

1706
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:30.980
<v Speaker 2>When you have an idea and it's in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>

1707
01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:31.993
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult for people to shake </v>
<v Speaker 2>that idea and they start arguing that </v>

1708
01:26:34.101 --> 01:26:34.934
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That idea becomes a part of their </v>

1709
01:26:35.781 --> 01:26:36.614
<v Speaker 2>identity and they dig their heels in </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeper when an opposing view is </v>

1710
01:26:40.041 --> 01:26:42.380
<v Speaker 2>presented to they connect themselves to </v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas.</v>

1711
01:26:42.850 --> 01:26:44.370
<v Speaker 2>It is who they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1712
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:45.343
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I try not to base my character </v>

1713
01:26:50.601 --> 01:26:54.560
<v Speaker 2>profile on something that is not yet </v>
<v Speaker 2>verified as objective truth,</v>

1714
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:58.040
<v Speaker 2>and that's a very good thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons why I don't have</v>

1715
01:26:58.041 --> 01:27:03.041
<v Speaker 2>tattoos on my body and stretching my </v>
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>

1716
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Go on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1717
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:12.850
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons is there's nothing I </v>
<v Speaker 2>am so sure about that.</v>

1718
01:27:14.211 --> 01:27:16.760
<v Speaker 2>I want to put it indelibly on my skin </v>
<v Speaker 2>with no,</v>

1719
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:17.570
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

1720
01:27:17.570 --> 01:27:22.310
<v Speaker 2>Let me say it differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing I value in my mind,</v>

1721
01:27:22.311 --> 01:27:23.150
<v Speaker 2>body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and soul.</v>

1722
01:27:23.151 --> 01:27:28.151
<v Speaker 2>So much in this moment that I want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>indelibly etched it on my skin because I</v>

1723
01:27:28.971 --> 01:27:33.971
<v Speaker 2>want to leave room for me to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly more enlightening thought later</v>

1724
01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:38.990
<v Speaker 2>that would override whatever was my </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision in that moment.</v>

1725
01:27:39.650 --> 01:27:42.770
<v Speaker 2>And since I count myself among the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifelong learners,</v>

1726
01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm learning stuff all the time.</v>

1727
01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:47.180
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1728
01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:50.390
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>

1729
01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:51.643
<v Speaker 2>That's even better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's something you've learned </v>

1730
01:27:53.061 --> 01:27:54.770
<v Speaker 2>recently?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You went,</v>

1731
01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.840
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1732
01:27:56.841 --> 01:27:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me think.</v>

1733
01:27:58.790 --> 01:28:01.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1734
01:28:01.761 --> 01:28:04.070
<v Speaker 2>Here's something I learned recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I knew this when I was a kid,</v>

1735
01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:06.590
<v Speaker 2>but if you're playing basketball and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're shooting,</v>

1736
01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:08.780
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>

1737
01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:09.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that didn't go in.</v>

1738
01:28:09.711 --> 01:28:10.341
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1739
01:28:10.341 --> 01:28:10.911
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rim.</v>

1740
01:28:10.911 --> 01:28:12.320
<v Speaker 2>They should maybe make the room a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>

1741
01:28:12.321 --> 01:28:13.154
<v Speaker 2>Iq score more often.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you realize two basketballs can fit </v>

1742
01:28:17.571 --> 01:28:21.070
<v Speaker 2>exactly side by side through the opening</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a basketball hoop.</v>

1743
01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1744
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:29.450
<v Speaker 2>I guess it makes sense to basketballs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tough squeeze.</v>

1745
01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:30.303
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a cosmically mind blowing </v>

1746
01:28:31.371 --> 01:28:34.760
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that gives you perspective.</v>

1747
01:28:34.761 --> 01:28:39.761
<v Speaker 2>Next time you watch a basketball game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's how these guys can fly from the,</v>

1748
01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:43.690
<v Speaker 2>from the foul line in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

1749
01:28:43.691 --> 01:28:48.691
<v Speaker 2>an airborne slam dunk and not miss </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the area of this opening is four</v>

1750
01:28:53.391 --> 01:28:54.620
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do the math.</v>

1751
01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:56.930
<v Speaker 2>It's four times as large as the ball </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

1752
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:57.783
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of the different positions that </v>

1753
01:28:58.551 --> 01:29:01.650
<v Speaker 2>could be in multiple positions and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do it,</v>

1754
01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:06.420
<v Speaker 2>so it's not that that's easy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>accomplish,</v>

1755
01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:07.673
<v Speaker 2>but knowing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize how much easier it is to </v>

1756
01:29:11.641 --> 01:29:13.140
<v Speaker 2>score.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you might have otherwise thought,</v>

1757
01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:15.510
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that was a recent.</v>

1758
01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:17.760
<v Speaker 2>That was a recent revelation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good revelation.</v>

1759
01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:18.673
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if basketball players </v>

1760
01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:21.990
<v Speaker 2>occasionally practice with a smaller </v>
<v Speaker 2>hole.</v>

1761
01:29:22.130 --> 01:29:24.210
<v Speaker 2>I think about this all the time.</v>

1762
01:29:24.210 --> 01:29:25.043
<v Speaker 2>I said if I was a basketball player,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to practice with a </v>

1763
01:29:26.341 --> 01:29:28.230
<v Speaker 2>heavier ball saying yes because that </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you would.</v>

1764
01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:31.980
<v Speaker 2>That would throw you off your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your practice in a bigger ball.</v>

1765
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:34.350
<v Speaker 2>They use the bigger ball as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We use the ball sometimes.</v>

1766
01:29:34.351 --> 01:29:36.030
<v Speaker 2>It's almost as big as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>

1767
01:29:36.031 --> 01:29:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Is it heavier?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1768
01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:37.650
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1769
01:29:37.650 --> 01:29:38.160
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

1770
01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.150
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't use a bigger bowl.</v>

1771
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:42.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a thing that I did a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet they still don't.</v>

1772
01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:44.370
<v Speaker 2>They no longer do it because then your </v>
<v Speaker 2>grip is different.</v>

1773
01:29:44.730 --> 01:29:49.590
<v Speaker 2>The grip of matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are your two hands go and what you</v>

1774
01:29:49.591 --> 01:29:50.424
<v Speaker 2>want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You use a smaller room and in baseball </v>

1775
01:29:53.101 --> 01:29:55.860
<v Speaker 2>you throw a faster pitch to give you </v>
<v Speaker 2>less reaction time.</v>

1776
01:29:55.861 --> 01:29:58.530
<v Speaker 2>That pool table that you like a skinnier</v>
<v Speaker 2>bat.</v>

1777
01:29:58.710 --> 01:30:01.020
<v Speaker 2>That pool table is a very small pocket </v>
<v Speaker 2>opening.</v>

1778
01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four inch pocket opening as opposed to a</v>

1779
01:30:03.661 --> 01:30:05.810
<v Speaker 2>five and a half inch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's quite a bit different.</v>

1780
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:06.930
<v Speaker 2>You're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it.</v>

1781
01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:10.200
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so uh,</v>

1782
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:11.230
<v Speaker 2>I would also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1783
01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:12.113
<v Speaker 2>growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played stickball in the street in New </v>

1784
01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:14.783
<v Speaker 2>York and so you're using basically a </v>
<v Speaker 2>broom handle and so when the first time </v>

1785
01:30:20.641 --> 01:30:23.970
<v Speaker 2>you play baseball officially it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1786
01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:25.313
<v Speaker 2>I've got this huge bat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so stick ball players tend to </v>

1787
01:30:29.491 --> 01:30:32.010
<v Speaker 2>transfer very well to baseball when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a kid.</v>

1788
01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:33.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because your instrument is bigger to </v>

1789
01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:36.950
<v Speaker 2>read the talent code.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Daniel coyle's.</v>

1790
01:30:37.010 --> 01:30:37.843
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the interesting parts about </v>

1791
01:30:39.241 --> 01:30:42.850
<v Speaker 2>it is Brazilian soccer players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how good they are and uh,</v>

1792
01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:43.723
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he attributed it to a different game </v>

1793
01:30:44.881 --> 01:30:47.610
<v Speaker 2>that they play with a heavier ball that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they do indoors.</v>

1794
01:30:48.030 --> 01:30:48.863
<v Speaker 2>It's a small heavy ball and because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it in tight quarters and involves </v>

1795
01:30:53.430 --> 01:30:54.263
<v Speaker 2>incredibly fast footwork and movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then these guys take that footwork </v>

1796
01:30:58.501 --> 01:31:03.180
<v Speaker 2>and movement and it translates amazingly</v>
<v Speaker 2>well to an open soccer field.</v>

1797
01:31:03.210 --> 01:31:06.630
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they calculated that because</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you would do is,</v>

1798
01:31:06.631 --> 01:31:07.464
<v Speaker 2>let's say the ball weighs twice as much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it would only go half as far when </v>

1799
01:31:10.081 --> 01:31:12.600
<v Speaker 2>you kicked it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then you make a field half as large.</v>

1800
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:16.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you can reproduce almost all of the</v>

1801
01:31:16.531 --> 01:31:17.364
<v Speaker 2>dynamics of the soccer game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was based on just trying to </v>

1802
01:31:20.521 --> 01:31:22.970
<v Speaker 2>play a game and like how far are you </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to call it in over?</v>

1803
01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:23.873
<v Speaker 2>If it's the boss twice as heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you throw throat half as far the field </v>

1804
01:31:26.641 --> 01:31:27.860
<v Speaker 2>has half the size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1805
01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Then you have a mini game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically you do it right.</v>

1806
01:31:30.810 --> 01:31:33.750
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense that there's a whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>fun exercise you can do,</v>

1807
01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:34.773
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing sports on other planets with </v>

1808
01:31:36.001 --> 01:31:36.990
<v Speaker 2>different grounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>

1809
01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:42.020
<v Speaker 2>very fun thing to do if you're a Dork,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1810
01:31:43.341 --> 01:31:43.740
<v Speaker 2>it's funny.</v>

1811
01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally I'll tweet something and </v>
<v Speaker 2>people say Dork and I say,</v>

1812
01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:49.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks for the compliment.</v>

1813
01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nerd.</v>

1814
01:31:51.650 --> 01:31:54.990
<v Speaker 2>Is he a bad dad used to take dork as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1815
01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:57.600
<v Speaker 2>You'd get wedgies to the nerds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1816
01:31:57.690 --> 01:31:59.890
<v Speaker 2>well the nerds would also be the that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

1817
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:04.930
<v Speaker 2>but now endured is like you can be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>science nerd and people like it.</v>

1818
01:32:05.010 --> 01:32:05.920
<v Speaker 2>That's a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1819
01:32:06.150 --> 01:32:08.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm an old movie nerd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can say that.</v>

1820
01:32:08.530 --> 01:32:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Or movie geek.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1821
01:32:10.410 --> 01:32:13.120
<v Speaker 2>Taken Dork,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dork and nerd.</v>

1822
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tell you,</v>

1823
01:32:14.610 --> 01:32:15.443
<v Speaker 2>I must,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I must have told you this last time I </v>

1824
01:32:16.721 --> 01:32:20.620
<v Speaker 2>was on your show when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was bigger than other kids.</v>

1825
01:32:21.070 --> 01:32:25.540
<v Speaker 2>I was always one of the tallest kids in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the class out of 30.</v>

1826
01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:26.673
<v Speaker 2>So I was bigger than others in the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was also physically fit and </v>

1827
01:32:33.941 --> 01:32:35.740
<v Speaker 2>physically active,</v>
<v Speaker 2>athletic.</v>

1828
01:32:36.490 --> 01:32:40.180
<v Speaker 2>But I was squarely in the Geek camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1829
01:32:40.181 --> 01:32:44.320
<v Speaker 2>I had my slide rule back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking down the car door</v>

1830
01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:46.633
<v Speaker 2>know you were also wrestling with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was captain of my high school </v>

1831
01:32:48.301 --> 01:32:49.134
<v Speaker 2>wrestling team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was a geek person who could </v>

1832
01:32:52.321 --> 01:32:53.880
<v Speaker 2>actually kick your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1833
01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:54.893
<v Speaker 2>And I saw how my fellow Geeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's the community that I </v>

1834
01:32:57.631 --> 01:32:58.464
<v Speaker 2>associated with card carrying were </v>
<v Speaker 2>treated by the football quarterback and </v>

1835
01:33:01.591 --> 01:33:04.620
<v Speaker 2>the popular kids and the kids who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>all beautiful.</v>

1836
01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:05.573
<v Speaker 2>And the ones who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I imagined my future as a superhero </v>

1837
01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:16.760
<v Speaker 2>defender of the Geeks so that you put up</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bat,</v>

1838
01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.113
<v Speaker 2>sigma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever Geeks they gonna put a few </v>

1839
01:33:19.201 --> 01:33:23.610
<v Speaker 2>digits of Pi and I come flying in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a Wedgie in progress,</v>

1840
01:33:23.611 --> 01:33:28.611
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just land and I'd grab the bully</v>

1841
01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:32.970
<v Speaker 2>and rip them off the encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've just saved the day.</v>

1842
01:33:32.971 --> 01:33:35.490
<v Speaker 2>This is my superhero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is the football players,</v>

1843
01:33:35.491 --> 01:33:35.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1844
01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:39.720
<v Speaker 2>always because there's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're rewarded for violence,</v>

1845
01:33:39.930 --> 01:33:40.650
<v Speaker 2>for violence.</v>

1846
01:33:40.650 --> 01:33:42.430
<v Speaker 2>They also have brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1847
01:33:42.510 --> 01:33:43.343
<v Speaker 2>as we've come to discover how fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that you find another high school </v>

1848
01:33:45.751 --> 01:33:46.584
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1849
01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Literally across the board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The majority of people who play football</v>

1850
01:33:50.641 --> 01:33:54.480
<v Speaker 2>have cte right in as far down as seventh</v>
<v Speaker 2>grade.</v>

1851
01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:57.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you set?</v>

1852
01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:01.530
<v Speaker 2>Remind me that's t stands for chronic </v>
<v Speaker 2>traumatic encephalopathy.</v>

1853
01:34:01.770 --> 01:34:05.100
<v Speaker 2>C and Sephora,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dot dot,</v>

1854
01:34:05.101 --> 01:34:10.101
<v Speaker 2>dot and cephalopathy both say like Mike </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyson on monotherapy.</v>

1855
01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:14.700
<v Speaker 2>So let me tell you that story about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christopher Columbus.</v>

1856
01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Dick Story,</v>

1857
01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:21.270
<v Speaker 2>I already told you the Dick Story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now let me tell you just something else.</v>

1858
01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:22.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1859
01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:27.140
<v Speaker 2>I think him coming to America was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most significant thing to ever happen in</v>

1860
01:34:30.061 --> 01:34:30.894
<v Speaker 2>our species.</v>

1861
01:34:31.650 --> 01:34:32.483
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1862
01:34:35.140 --> 01:34:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Silence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Internet porn.</v>

1863
01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Porn in another medium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1864
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1865
01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:47.633
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet porn is just a matter of </v>

1866
01:34:48.821 --> 01:34:51.220
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a matter of yes.</v>

1867
01:34:51.221 --> 01:34:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Does it exist or does it not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1868
01:34:53.890 --> 01:34:56.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the most significant </v>
<v Speaker 2>event to happen in our space.</v>

1869
01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 2>Kind amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you stop</v>

1870
01:34:58.190 --> 01:35:01.070
<v Speaker 1>and think about the fact that at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time,</v>

1871
01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.353
<v Speaker 1>other than the native Americans who </v>
<v Speaker 1>lived here who were living a nomadic </v>

1872
01:35:05.031 --> 01:35:10.031
<v Speaker 1>tribal existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few people that had the wheel,</v>

1873
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:12.163
<v Speaker 1>that had firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had all these things that had </v>

1874
01:35:14.031 --> 01:35:17.000
<v Speaker 1>already been achieved in the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world had made their way to this place.</v>

1875
01:35:17.001 --> 01:35:18.200
<v Speaker 1>So then watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1876
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:20.240
<v Speaker 1>here's how it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1877
01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:21.433
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I presume that you have some </v>

1878
01:35:23.691 --> 01:35:27.440
<v Speaker 1>skepticism of this claim as most people </v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

1879
01:35:27.441 --> 01:35:30.600
<v Speaker 1>especially the Columbus haters who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there right now.</v>

1880
01:35:30.610 --> 01:35:32.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't really have any skepticism about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to be honest with you.</v>

1881
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:34.183
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me describe to you why I think this </v>

1882
01:35:35.991 --> 01:35:36.890
<v Speaker 1>was true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1883
01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:39.140
<v Speaker 1>And then you can tell me whether you </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree or not.</v>

1884
01:35:39.490 --> 01:35:41.490
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1885
01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:42.453
<v Speaker 1>we're hunter gatherers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't settled down yet that early </v>

1886
01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:47.353
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>

1887
01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:52.640
<v Speaker 1>And we're basically wandering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're following the herds.</v>

1888
01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:56.000
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the ice age hits.</v>

1889
01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is an ice age?</v>

1890
01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:00.193
<v Speaker 1>And Ice Age means it is so cold that </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the moisture evaporates from the </v>

1891
01:36:05.790 --> 01:36:07.640
<v Speaker 1>oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to the clouds,</v>

1892
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:10.790
<v Speaker 1>the clouds go over the land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't rain,</v>

1893
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:16.270
<v Speaker 1>it snows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the snow falls and then it stays.</v>

1894
01:36:18.710 --> 01:36:23.450
<v Speaker 1>So the water that had lifted up from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean does not return to the ocean.</v>

1895
01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:28.070
<v Speaker 1>It accumulates on the land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this accumulation,</v>

1896
01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:32.240
<v Speaker 1>when it's significant and sustained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call glaciers.</v>

1897
01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Glaciers is not itself a snowfall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is compressed snow.</v>

1898
01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:41.393
<v Speaker 1>It's basically changed state into this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ice river that flows very slowly </v>

1899
01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:47.173
<v Speaker 1>back to the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the oceans are getting drained </v>

1900
01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:54.530
<v Speaker 1>faster than they're getting replenished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So during the ice age,</v>

1901
01:36:54.531 --> 01:36:55.364
<v Speaker 1>the ocean levels dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exposing the Bering Strait Land Bridge </v>

1902
01:37:01.610 --> 01:37:06.140
<v Speaker 1>between Asia and what is now Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically North America,</v>

1903
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:10.820
<v Speaker 1>our ancestors who come out of Africa go </v>
<v Speaker 1>into Europe.</v>

1904
01:37:10.821 --> 01:37:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Some state others kept wandering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some stayed low above the Mediterranean.</v>

1905
01:37:15.531 --> 01:37:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Others went high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they populate Asia,</v>

1906
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:21.980
<v Speaker 1>they keep walking because there's land </v>
<v Speaker 1>bridge there.</v>

1907
01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:24.620
<v Speaker 1>They don't even know it's a bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just more land,</v>

1908
01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:25.813
<v Speaker 1>so they walk and they enter North </v>
<v Speaker 1>America and from there there's kind of </v>

1909
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:30.650
<v Speaker 1>only way you can go with south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>

1910
01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:34.700
<v Speaker 1>the weather gets a little better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Ice Age ends,</v>

1911
01:37:36.570 --> 01:37:40.450
<v Speaker 1>the glaciers melt back into the oceans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oceans level,</v>

1912
01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:43.660
<v Speaker 1>ocean levels rise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Closing.</v>

1913
01:37:43.661 --> 01:37:44.710
<v Speaker 1>The landbridge</v>

1914
01:37:46.170 --> 01:37:51.170
<v Speaker 1>stranding a branch of the human species </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 10,000</v>

1915
01:37:54.181 --> 01:37:55.014
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those humans who made it across that </v>

1916
01:37:57.970 --> 01:38:00.750
<v Speaker 1>landbridge and spread out into North </v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

1917
01:38:00.810 --> 01:38:01.643
<v Speaker 1>Central America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South America have only a few families </v>

1918
01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:11.960
<v Speaker 1>as their parent genetic genetic origin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1919
01:38:13.620 --> 01:38:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Ollie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like that.</v>

1920
01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:15.503
<v Speaker 1>Some research says is like eight family </v>
<v Speaker 1>lineages populated the entire north and </v>

1921
01:38:18.811 --> 01:38:22.080
<v Speaker 1>South American continents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the land bridge breaks.</v>

1922
01:38:23.190 --> 01:38:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Now you have Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asia,</v>

1923
01:38:24.901 --> 01:38:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and North and South America,</v>

1924
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:28.663
<v Speaker 1>and they know nothing of one another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two separate branches of the human </v>

1925
01:38:34.261 --> 01:38:35.910
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Vikings,</v>

1926
01:38:35.911 --> 01:38:38.090
<v Speaker 1>not withstanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they found came over.</v>

1927
01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:41.250
<v Speaker 1>They didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That even if they did,</v>

1928
01:38:41.251 --> 01:38:43.980
<v Speaker 1>their influence was near zero relative </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Europeans.</v>

1929
01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:48.780
<v Speaker 1>So we're talking about influence here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a branch had this continued.</v>

1930
01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:53.610
<v Speaker 1>This is how you speciate this is why the</v>
<v Speaker 1>species on Australia,</v>

1931
01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:56.100
<v Speaker 1>that's why you have mammals there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have pouches,</v>

1932
01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:57.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No other mammals do that.</v>

1933
01:38:57.871 --> 01:39:01.260
<v Speaker 1>They split off and they evolved their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own way.</v>

1934
01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So 10,000</v>

1935
01:39:04.171 --> 01:39:08.530
<v Speaker 1>years is not enough to grow three heads </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

1936
01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:12.510
<v Speaker 1>12 fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but our species is separate.</v>

1937
01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Now Columbus crosses the Atlantic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes contact with humans.</v>

1938
01:39:19.260 --> 01:39:21.450
<v Speaker 1>This is the first time that has happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 10,000</v>

1939
01:39:21.451 --> 01:39:22.284
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have rejoined two branches of the </v>

1940
01:39:25.891 --> 01:39:26.724
<v Speaker 1>human species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are now one common genetic group and </v>

1941
01:39:34.591 --> 01:39:35.424
<v Speaker 1>that genetic crossbreeding and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>continues to this day we fly to any </v>

1942
01:39:39.691 --> 01:39:41.790
<v Speaker 1>corner of the world and mates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1943
01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:44.460
<v Speaker 1>And the mating already began </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately?</v>

1944
01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:45.673
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were diseases that Columbus </v>

1945
01:39:46.321 --> 01:39:47.154
<v Speaker 1>brought to North America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much written about that less written is </v>

1946
01:39:50.431 --> 01:39:54.420
<v Speaker 1>that he brought syphilis back to Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first cases of syphilis in 14,</v>

1947
01:39:54.421 --> 01:39:56.640
<v Speaker 1>92.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

1948
01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.880
<v Speaker 1>And then it skyrocketed from the native </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>

1949
01:40:00.210 --> 01:40:01.800
<v Speaker 1>What did they have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem with it?</v>

1950
01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:02.693
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the details of how the </v>

1951
01:40:04.561 --> 01:40:05.394
<v Speaker 1>physiology of the natives have dealt </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that or whether it mutated and </v>

1952
01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.570
<v Speaker 1>there may people know that I'm not among</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1953
01:40:12.690 --> 01:40:14.110
<v Speaker 1>That's fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if just look at,</v>

1954
01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.640
<v Speaker 1>you look at the graph of syphilis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>syphilis cases in Europe.</v>

1955
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:18.743
<v Speaker 1>It all began in 1492 when he came back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying is this was a hugely </v>

1956
01:40:24.391 --> 01:40:25.224
<v Speaker 1>significant event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rejoining of the branches of the </v>

1957
01:40:28.111 --> 01:40:30.180
<v Speaker 1>human species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1958
01:40:30.181 --> 01:40:31.230
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that,</v>

1959
01:40:31.231 --> 01:40:33.720
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the most important event.</v>

1960
01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:35.070
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>native Americans,</v>

1961
01:40:35.071 --> 01:40:36.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's famous,</v>

1962
01:40:36.510 --> 01:40:39.720
<v Speaker 1>infamous problem with metabolizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>

1963
01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With native Americans,</v>

1964
01:40:41.370 --> 01:40:42.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else has that problem?</v>

1965
01:40:42.570 --> 01:40:44.850
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

1966
01:40:44.910 --> 01:40:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1967
01:40:47.730 --> 01:40:49.260
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an Asian issue.</v>

1968
01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so who stayed in?</v>

1969
01:40:52.930 --> 01:40:57.610
<v Speaker 1>So you look at who populated north and </v>
<v Speaker 1>South America after the,</v>

1970
01:40:57.650 --> 01:40:58.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the land bridge,</v>

1971
01:40:58.900 --> 01:41:02.600
<v Speaker 1>whoever was right at the edge of Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the land bridges so,</v>

1972
01:41:02.710 --> 01:41:06.740
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Asians and and North American and,</v>

1973
01:41:06.750 --> 01:41:07.583
<v Speaker 1>and the natives of north and South </v>
<v Speaker 1>America have more in common with each </v>

1974
01:41:11.261 --> 01:41:12.094
<v Speaker 1>other because of this than most other </v>
<v Speaker 1>pairs or groups you might grab around </v>

1975
01:41:15.971 --> 01:41:16.480
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

1976
01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:20.890
<v Speaker 1>But my point is obviously we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot to blame Columbus for,</v>

1977
01:41:20.891 --> 01:41:23.500
<v Speaker 1>but he just happened to be the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>did it first.</v>

1978
01:41:23.620 --> 01:41:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Europe was coming to the new world no </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter what,</v>

1979
01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:29.830
<v Speaker 1>everybody was trying to find a faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade route to the indies.</v>

1980
01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:32.710
<v Speaker 1>And so if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if it wasn't Columbus,</v>

1981
01:41:32.711 --> 01:41:34.420
<v Speaker 1>it would have been arnold mednick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1982
01:41:34.421 --> 01:41:38.350
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody did that and the rest is,</v>

1983
01:41:38.351 --> 01:41:39.280
<v Speaker 1>as they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

1984
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:40.623
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So personally I think the most </v>

1985
01:41:42.701 --> 01:41:44.710
<v Speaker 1>significant thing to happen in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

1986
01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:48.640
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise we'd still be two stranded </v>
<v Speaker 1>branches of humans.</v>

1987
01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:50.753
<v Speaker 1>It would be fascinating though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Australia stranded to see what </v>

1988
01:41:53.771 --> 01:41:57.190
<v Speaker 1>would happen if this has gone on for </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of years,</v>

1989
01:41:57.230 --> 01:41:59.020
<v Speaker 1>have 100,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would have been a different story.</v>

1990
01:41:59.080 --> 01:41:59.913
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your immunities would be different </v>

1991
01:42:01.961 --> 01:42:03.300
<v Speaker 1>to your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1992
01:42:03.490 --> 01:42:04.323
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the big concern about </v>

1993
01:42:04.781 --> 01:42:05.614
<v Speaker 1>aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1994
01:42:06.010 --> 01:42:08.560
<v Speaker 1>One of the big concerns is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a virus,</v>

1995
01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:13.600
<v Speaker 1>the pickup from somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's harder to accept.</v>

1996
01:42:13.661 --> 01:42:15.140
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1997
01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.520
<v Speaker 1>what are the chances that a oak tree </v>
<v Speaker 1>would catch whooping cough?</v>

1998
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not so good.</v>

1999
01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:24.753
<v Speaker 1>We're two different species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so viruses tend to be very species </v>

2000
01:42:27.791 --> 01:42:28.780
<v Speaker 1>targeted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2001
01:42:28.781 --> 01:42:31.480
<v Speaker 1>But what about now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't jump species.</v>

2002
01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:32.980
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can jump species,</v>

2003
01:42:32.981 --> 01:42:33.814
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a jump mammal to mammal </v>

2004
01:42:35.760 --> 01:42:38.140
<v Speaker 1>doesn't vertebrate invertebrate Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

2005
01:42:38.230 --> 01:42:40.480
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can happen,</v>

2006
01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:41.673
<v Speaker 1>but the more different the life form is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is sensible to suppose that the less </v>

2007
01:42:46.721 --> 01:42:48.430
<v Speaker 1>likely you're going to share the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases,</v>

2008
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:49.383
<v Speaker 1>that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But NASA regardless has safeguards in </v>

2009
01:42:51.671 --> 01:42:56.671
<v Speaker 1>place in the event that that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

2010
01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:59.230
<v Speaker 1>it's called a planetary protection </v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

2011
01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:01.500
<v Speaker 1>In Ethics Code is a whole division of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Masco.</v>

2012
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.823
<v Speaker 1>It's protecting earth from bugs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be coming from space on our own </v>

2013
01:43:06.041 --> 01:43:10.540
<v Speaker 1>spaceship that we bring back and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>protects destinations from us.</v>

2014
01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:15.310
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain sterilization levels </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we invoke the Cassini spacecraft.</v>

2015
01:43:16.420 --> 01:43:18.970
<v Speaker 1>We plunged that back into Saturn in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

2016
01:43:19.690 --> 01:43:22.330
<v Speaker 1>When we were done with it and ran out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

2017
01:43:22.331 --> 01:43:24.790
<v Speaker 1>We're done with it plunged into Saturn </v>
<v Speaker 1>to vaporize.</v>

2018
01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:26.470
<v Speaker 1>We didn't leave in an orbit around </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturn.</v>

2019
01:43:26.471 --> 01:43:27.304
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it might have crashed into one </v>

2020
01:43:29.621 --> 01:43:30.454
<v Speaker 1>of Saturn's moons that might have life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if someone had sneezed on the </v>

2021
01:43:35.141 --> 01:43:35.974
<v Speaker 1>spacecraft before it got launched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to contaminate the life </v>

2022
01:43:38.621 --> 01:43:40.990
<v Speaker 1>that we are later gonna one day want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>study.</v>

2023
01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:45.340
<v Speaker 1>So that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we plunged it into Saturn.</v>

2024
01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:48.190
<v Speaker 1>That's why that is why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were worried about,</v>

2025
01:43:48.191 --> 01:43:52.190
<v Speaker 1>let me be in hitting Europa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once it's dead and you can't track it or</v>

2026
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:53.810
<v Speaker 2>guide it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it's a.</v>

2027
01:43:53.811 --> 01:43:55.420
<v Speaker 2>it's a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wildcard.</v>

2028
01:43:55.930 --> 01:44:00.410
<v Speaker 2>It might hit a Europa is jupiter and </v>
<v Speaker 2>enceladus.</v>

2029
01:44:00.411 --> 01:44:03.770
<v Speaker 2>There are other moons that have sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean water,</v>

2030
01:44:03.771 --> 01:44:04.604
<v Speaker 2>the water worlds basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the concern is that we would </v>

2031
01:44:07.521 --> 01:44:10.940
<v Speaker 2>introduce life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suppose we did it crashed and then we go</v>

2032
01:44:10.941 --> 01:44:13.640
<v Speaker 2>back later and find life and it has dna </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like here,</v>

2033
01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:15.650
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't our life that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>contaminated with.</v>

2034
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you don't want to confuse </v>
<v Speaker 2>the future science of it.</v>

2035
01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:21.050
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the plan.</v>

2036
01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:24.170
<v Speaker 2>Can you even watch a science movie like </v>
<v Speaker 2>science fiction movies?</v>

2037
01:44:24.171 --> 01:44:25.550
<v Speaker 2>I know he had a real problem with </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravity,</v>

2038
01:44:25.560 --> 01:44:26.120
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2039
01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:29.900
<v Speaker 2>So let me set the record straight here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2040
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:31.820
<v Speaker 2>let me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me just go on record.</v>

2041
01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:32.713
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2042
01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:38.480
<v Speaker 2>I've been deeply misunderstood with my </v>
<v Speaker 2>comments on movies,</v>

2043
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:40.760
<v Speaker 2>deeply misunderstood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply,</v>

2044
01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:44.810
<v Speaker 2>deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I've just stopped.</v>

2045
01:44:45.310 --> 01:44:47.930
<v Speaker 2>When was the last time you saw a movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>comment in my twitter stream?</v>

2046
01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:49.600
<v Speaker 2>They haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't?</v>

2047
01:44:50.230 --> 01:44:53.420
<v Speaker 2>I've kind of just stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't the Matthew mcconahey movie?</v>

2048
01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.570
<v Speaker 2>Did you comment on that one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>

2049
01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interstellar interstellar.</v>

2050
01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:00.020
<v Speaker 2>That's the last one I commented on in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big way.</v>

2051
01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're done.</v>

2052
01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:02.653
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because people then thought I was just </v>

2053
01:45:05.481 --> 01:45:06.570
<v Speaker 2>being nitpicky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2054
01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:07.413
<v Speaker 2>D one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not fun going to the movies with </v>

2055
01:45:08.301 --> 01:45:10.320
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God.</v>

2056
01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:11.453
<v Speaker 2>Let that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tyson will just say that can never </v>

2057
01:45:12.561 --> 01:45:14.510
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2058
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:19.750
<v Speaker 2>so my intent was my intent did not match</v>
<v Speaker 2>how people received my intent.</v>

2059
01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:21.613
<v Speaker 2>My intent is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's an observation that I think if </v>

2060
01:45:25.221 --> 01:45:26.054
<v Speaker 2>you understood this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would enhance your appreciation of </v>

2061
01:45:27.591 --> 01:45:29.450
<v Speaker 2>the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me give an example.</v>

2062
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:30.710
<v Speaker 2>Please do star wars.</v>

2063
01:45:30.710 --> 01:45:31.543
<v Speaker 2>The force awakens they've got was at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the one that introduced a bb </v>

2064
01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:38.013
<v Speaker 2>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2065
01:45:38.020 --> 01:45:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Is that the most recent one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2066
01:45:39.331 --> 01:45:39.620
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2067
01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:40.453
<v Speaker 2>It's just like for movies ago now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've lost track because there's </v>

2068
01:45:42.231 --> 01:45:44.850
<v Speaker 2>another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the one that introduced BBA,</v>

2069
01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:45.713
<v Speaker 2>cute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As cute as ever fell a cute little </v>

2070
01:45:47.121 --> 01:45:49.520
<v Speaker 2>fellow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in there they have the,</v>

2071
01:45:49.521 --> 01:45:52.460
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the updated deathstar.</v>

2072
01:45:52.940 --> 01:45:53.890
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2073
01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:57.140
<v Speaker 2>Remember the old death star?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has enough power to destroy a planet.</v>

2074
01:45:57.470 --> 01:45:58.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one,</v>

2075
01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:05.200
<v Speaker 2>it can suck energy out of a star so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the star no longer exists.</v>

2076
01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Then it could take these energy beams </v>
<v Speaker 2>and killed six planets at once.</v>

2077
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:14.960
<v Speaker 2>It's no longer just a one planet killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six or eight,</v>

2078
01:46:14.961 --> 01:46:17.660
<v Speaker 2>whatever the number was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like high single digits.</v>

2079
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:19.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2080
01:46:19.341 --> 01:46:24.341
<v Speaker 2>I did the math on this and I tweeted and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said first,</v>

2081
01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:27.620
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take all the energy from a star,</v>

2082
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:30.070
<v Speaker 2>you become a star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's know.</v>

2083
01:46:30.140 --> 01:46:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they've got a containment </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanism.</v>

2084
01:46:31.881 --> 01:46:33.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll give it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the future after all,</v>

2085
01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:35.293
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but will that long time ago in a galaxy </v>

2086
01:46:37.791 --> 01:46:38.470
<v Speaker 2>far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far away.</v>

2087
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:39.620
<v Speaker 2>It's another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

2088
01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:41.650
<v Speaker 2>another universe of civilizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2089
01:46:42.170 --> 01:46:45.920
<v Speaker 2>But they have lightspeed and we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the future of our technology.</v>

2090
01:46:46.130 --> 01:46:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's the past of our time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

2091
01:46:49.710 --> 01:46:50.543
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

2092
01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:51.693
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>

2093
01:46:54.370 --> 01:46:58.020
<v Speaker 2>So you do the calculation and I forgot </v>
<v Speaker 2>the number,</v>

2094
01:46:58.021 --> 01:46:58.854
<v Speaker 2>but I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I calculated how much energy is stored </v>

2095
01:47:00.961 --> 01:47:05.961
<v Speaker 2>in a star that's enough energy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>explode a thousand planets.</v>

2096
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are underrepresented.</v>

2097
01:47:10.260 --> 01:47:13.260
<v Speaker 2>The energy that it sucked out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>host Atar out of the store.</v>

2098
01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:14.633
<v Speaker 2>And I thought this could have been more </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad ass than even they came up with in </v>

2099
01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:22.110
<v Speaker 2>this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the nature of my comments.</v>

2100
01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Not Real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could this happen?</v>

2101
01:47:24.271 --> 01:47:26.520
<v Speaker 2>Could it not happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me give you a perspective.</v>

2102
01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:27.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well wait,</v>

2103
01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:27.953
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so 20 percent of people just get pissed </v>

2104
01:47:30.841 --> 01:47:31.674
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eighty percent really like it and they </v>

2105
01:47:33.511 --> 01:47:36.360
<v Speaker 2>want more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that 20 percent they,</v>

2106
01:47:36.630 --> 01:47:41.630
<v Speaker 2>they cut me no slack and I'm only doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this for people to enjoy and if I,</v>

2107
01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:46.560
<v Speaker 2>if I have that level of hate mail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to continue it.</v>

2108
01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:48.630
<v Speaker 2>So I just basically stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

2109
01:47:48.650 --> 01:47:52.440
<v Speaker 2>I'll have these thoughts to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have the urge to share them.</v>

2110
01:47:52.620 --> 01:47:53.453
<v Speaker 2>I still have the thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to teach you the art of post and </v>

2111
01:47:56.941 --> 01:47:58.740
<v Speaker 2>drop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2112
01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:00.240
<v Speaker 2>This is what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You post something,</v>

2113
01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:03.680
<v Speaker 2>know people are going to get mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You drop your phone and you walk away.</v>

2114
01:48:06.330 --> 01:48:07.800
<v Speaker 2>You got to learn how to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2115
01:48:07.801 --> 01:48:09.270
<v Speaker 2>You can't be reading those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>comments.</v>

2116
01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:11.120
<v Speaker 2>It's dealing with too many human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2117
01:48:11.130 --> 01:48:12.240
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get that.</v>

2118
01:48:12.510 --> 01:48:14.670
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't because you still changing</v>

2119
01:48:14.671 --> 01:48:16.240
<v Speaker 2>your behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morons.</v>

2120
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:17.970
<v Speaker 2>Here's my rebuttal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your rebuttal,</v>

2121
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.150
<v Speaker 2>my rebuttal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2122
01:48:19.350 --> 01:48:22.740
<v Speaker 2>If you're watching a movie that takes </v>
<v Speaker 2>place in 1958,</v>

2123
01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:27.300
<v Speaker 2>it's a period piece and there's a car </v>
<v Speaker 2>from 1960.</v>

2124
01:48:27.450 --> 01:48:28.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be crazy.</v>

2125
01:48:28.770 --> 01:48:31.050
<v Speaker 2>And someone who's a car expert points </v>
<v Speaker 2>that out and say,</v>

2126
01:48:31.051 --> 01:48:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an expert.</v>

2127
01:48:32.671 --> 01:48:33.504
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you complain that the person noticed </v>

2128
01:48:35.961 --> 01:48:36.794
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2129
01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:39.780
<v Speaker 2>You praise their expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get mad at the movie.</v>

2130
01:48:39.810 --> 01:48:40.643
<v Speaker 2>If you get mad at the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're watching a Jane Austin period </v>

2131
01:48:43.381 --> 01:48:44.214
<v Speaker 2>piece and it's 1870,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever they took place and someone </v>

2132
01:48:48.210 --> 01:48:51.930
<v Speaker 2>gets out of the carriage with tie dye </v>
<v Speaker 2>bell bottoms,</v>

2133
01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:54.620
<v Speaker 2>you would cry foul.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would take you up.</v>

2134
01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:55.453
<v Speaker 2>I'm exaggerating there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously it could be a top hat instead </v>

2135
01:48:56.911 --> 01:48:59.010
<v Speaker 2>of a derby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would cry foul.</v>

2136
01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:00.053
<v Speaker 2>If you wear a costume designer and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>would all be impressed by that level of </v>

2137
01:49:04.291 --> 01:49:09.291
<v Speaker 2>knowledge that you exhibited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am bringing a level of science to bear</v>

2138
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:10.343
<v Speaker 2>on a movie that is no different from </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody else's expertise who is out </v>

2139
01:49:13.981 --> 01:49:17.220
<v Speaker 2>there that we have praised for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>invocation.</v>

2140
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:22.020
<v Speaker 2>Yet people are not granting me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>latitude to make those comments.</v>

2141
01:49:22.021 --> 01:49:25.020
<v Speaker 2>I don't like these generalizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2142
01:49:25.170 --> 01:49:27.600
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying people are not doing this.</v>

2143
01:49:27.601 --> 01:49:31.440
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A small vocal minority that are assholes</v>

2144
01:49:31.770 --> 01:49:33.920
<v Speaker 2>and those are the people that you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>altering your behavior for.</v>

2145
01:49:34.110 --> 01:49:34.943
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think is ridiculous about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this because my idols people and enjoy </v>

2146
01:49:37.471 --> 01:49:38.304
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When are you talking about gravity and </v>

2147
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:40.343
<v Speaker 2>the fact that hair wouldn't do that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the space stations weren't that close </v>

2148
01:49:42.721 --> 01:49:45.060
<v Speaker 2>together and see it in the sky.</v>

2149
01:49:45.060 --> 01:49:46.540
<v Speaker 2>My work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2150
01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:47.393
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

2151
01:49:47.410 --> 01:49:51.090
<v Speaker 2>But it's assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2152
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I my tweets or offerings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>

2153
01:49:54.270 --> 01:49:58.180
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

2154
01:49:58.181 --> 01:50:00.130
<v Speaker 2>The only problem is you're reading </v>
<v Speaker 2>responses.</v>

2155
01:50:00.430 --> 01:50:01.690
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing is wonderful.</v>

2156
01:50:01.890 --> 01:50:06.070
<v Speaker 2>One educating people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty percent freak out is high for the</v>

2157
01:50:06.071 --> 01:50:08.280
<v Speaker 2>fuck is 20 percent listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amy.</v>

2158
01:50:08.281 --> 01:50:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm believe that's numbers here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2159
01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm when it's five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I take notice.</v>

2160
01:50:14.110 --> 01:50:16.000
<v Speaker 2>When you say 20 percent like what are </v>
<v Speaker 2>you doing?</v>

2161
01:50:16.001 --> 01:50:18.060
<v Speaker 2>Calculations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You actually do another scan.</v>

2162
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:19.660
<v Speaker 2>100 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 of them.</v>

2163
01:50:19.661 --> 01:50:20.494
<v Speaker 2>That's just run into 20 assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 20 assholes out of the millions and </v>

2164
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:25.383
<v Speaker 2>millions of people that follow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have decided to reach out and and </v>

2165
01:50:27.770 --> 01:50:28.603
<v Speaker 2>Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're altering your behavior for </v>

2166
01:50:29.741 --> 01:50:33.460
<v Speaker 2>assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like those quotes.</v>

2167
01:50:33.490 --> 01:50:34.480
<v Speaker 2>I like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

2168
01:50:34.570 --> 01:50:36.910
<v Speaker 2>when you break things down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't know those things and I</v>

2169
01:50:36.911 --> 01:50:38.830
<v Speaker 2>like thinking about like the hair and </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravity.</v>

2170
01:50:38.830 --> 01:50:39.700
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2171
01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:40.713
<v Speaker 2>a fucking shit be standing straight up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the only reason why I mentioned </v>

2172
01:50:42.521 --> 01:50:44.560
<v Speaker 2>about here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because every photo of anybody with long</v>

2173
01:50:44.561 --> 01:50:47.200
<v Speaker 2>hair wouldn't happen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but anyone was long here in space.</v>

2174
01:50:47.380 --> 01:50:52.380
<v Speaker 2>It standing up on edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a completely obvious thing that was</v>

2175
01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:55.330
<v Speaker 2>omitted from the filming of gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2176
01:50:55.331 --> 01:50:58.390
<v Speaker 2>but you have to have hair and makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to have a reason to exist.</v>

2177
01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:00.520
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I might do,</v>

2178
01:51:00.521 --> 01:51:05.410
<v Speaker 2>I might take a poll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might put up by my postal service.</v>

2179
01:51:05.770 --> 01:51:08.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to force feed curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have to listen on your feet.</v>

2180
01:51:08.830 --> 01:51:11.710
<v Speaker 2>No one else to feed anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Force feeding anything.</v>

2181
01:51:11.711 --> 01:51:13.780
<v Speaker 2>You pretty offerings out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

2182
01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:16.300
<v Speaker 2>does not force feeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not knocking on someone's home.</v>

2183
01:51:16.301 --> 01:51:17.500
<v Speaker 2>Wake up bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Shit.</v>

2184
01:51:17.501 --> 01:51:20.400
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not forcing myself on your property.</v>

2185
01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Do we get it all?</v>

2186
01:51:21.490 --> 01:51:22.323
<v Speaker 2>Put the shotgun down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to hear me talk about your </v>

2187
01:51:23.621 --> 01:51:25.000
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This in man.</v>

2188
01:51:25.330 --> 01:51:27.070
<v Speaker 2>I said about bb eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2189
01:51:28.090 --> 01:51:31.210
<v Speaker 2>first I said bbs way cuter than r two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>d two,</v>

2190
01:51:31.570 --> 01:51:35.450
<v Speaker 2>and I use like five a's in the way just </v>
<v Speaker 2>to just to start a fight because that.</v>

2191
01:51:35.451 --> 01:51:36.550
<v Speaker 2>That's a fun fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2192
01:51:36.590 --> 01:51:39.980
<v Speaker 2>Then I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way are to a bb eight,</v>

2193
01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:40.953
<v Speaker 2>a smooth metal rolling spherical ball </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have skidded uncontrollably on </v>

2194
01:51:47.021 --> 01:51:51.070
<v Speaker 2>sand in the whole movie is moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

2195
01:51:51.071 --> 01:51:52.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2196
01:51:52.930 --> 01:51:53.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would.</v>

2197
01:51:53.850 --> 01:51:57.040
<v Speaker 2>That's why you deflate your touch while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you deflate your tires to drive on sand.</v>

2198
01:51:57.250 --> 01:51:58.083
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2199
01:51:58.250 --> 01:51:59.620
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever tried riding a bicycle?</v>

2200
01:51:59.621 --> 01:52:00.840
<v Speaker 2>And Sandra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's impossible to.</v>

2201
01:52:00.860 --> 01:52:03.010
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And imagine that with rubber tires.</v>

2202
01:52:03.011 --> 01:52:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Imagine steel tires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not running on a sand dune.</v>

2203
01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:07.730
<v Speaker 2>Holy Gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2204
01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:10.180
<v Speaker 2>One of the hardest things you could do </v>
<v Speaker 2>for talking about getting into shape,</v>

2205
01:52:10.720 --> 01:52:13.420
<v Speaker 2>so it will work.</v>

2206
01:52:13.450 --> 01:52:15.750
<v Speaker 2>If you have a hard surface just below </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2207
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:16.833
<v Speaker 2>a dusting of sand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you then you can dig into it and </v>

2208
01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:24.880
<v Speaker 2>some resistance to sand then connects to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hard surface.</v>

2209
01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:28.620
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I posted this and people say,</v>

2210
01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:29.473
<v Speaker 2>you're ruining the movie for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people started this assholes </v>

2211
01:52:31.961 --> 01:52:32.990
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who the.</v>

2212
01:52:33.100 --> 01:52:36.310
<v Speaker 2>When you say people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just listening to assholes,</v>

2213
01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:38.590
<v Speaker 2>smart people going to read that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2214
01:52:39.010 --> 01:52:40.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is stupid.</v>

2215
01:52:40.061 --> 01:52:43.290
<v Speaker 2>It would roll around and it gives you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking thing track.</v>

2216
01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:45.560
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually happened as a result.</v>

2217
01:52:45.561 --> 01:52:47.840
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm getting phone calls from </v>
<v Speaker 2>producers.</v>

2218
01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:50.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a little bit of science.</v>

2219
01:52:50.151 --> 01:52:52.340
<v Speaker 2>We want to make sure that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweet about it.</v>

2220
01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:56.870
<v Speaker 2>You keeping them on point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you know,</v>

2221
01:52:56.871 --> 01:52:57.704
<v Speaker 2>I might be most famous among in movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>commenting for the final scene in </v>

2222
01:53:02.151 --> 01:53:03.980
<v Speaker 2>titanic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2223
01:53:04.170 --> 01:53:05.003
<v Speaker 2>If you knew about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what would you say about the </v>

2224
01:53:06.681 --> 01:53:06.900
<v Speaker 2>fucking.</v>

2225
01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:10.510
<v Speaker 2>So we know where the titanic sank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The longitude and latitude.</v>

2226
01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know what time of day.</v>

2227
01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:16.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so at the p of v,</v>

2228
01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:18.170
<v Speaker 2>the point of view of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of rose,</v>

2229
01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:20.570
<v Speaker 2>and she's looking up deliriously to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sky.</v>

2230
01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:23.560
<v Speaker 2>There's only one sky she should've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was the wrong sky.</v>

2231
01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:28.730
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the left side of the sky there was worse</v>

2232
01:53:28.731 --> 01:53:29.564
<v Speaker 2>than it was worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The left side of this guy was a mirror </v>

2233
01:53:31.161 --> 01:53:33.580
<v Speaker 2>reflection of the right side of the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you call jeans?</v>

2234
01:53:33.670 --> 01:53:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Because I called her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know.</v>

2235
01:53:34.911 --> 01:53:37.460
<v Speaker 2>Replaced back in 1996.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it when it first came out.</v>

2236
01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I noticed instantly and because I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sky,</v>

2237
01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:42.610
<v Speaker 2>this is what I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2238
01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:43.633
<v Speaker 2>so no reply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five years later I bumped into him at a </v>

2239
01:53:46.641 --> 01:53:51.020
<v Speaker 2>meeting a NASA hosted a meeting with </v>
<v Speaker 2>some explorers and some scientists.</v>

2240
01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:53.390
<v Speaker 2>I brought it up to him and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2241
01:53:54.380 --> 01:53:55.213
<v Speaker 2>at the time I was not overseeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>postproduction and that's when we added </v>

2242
01:53:57.471 --> 01:53:57.710
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2243
01:53:57.710 --> 01:54:01.730
<v Speaker 2>So I'm immaturely wanting them to grovel</v>
<v Speaker 2>at my feet for forgiveness.</v>

2244
01:54:02.630 --> 01:54:04.610
<v Speaker 2>I wanted them to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not what happened.</v>

2245
01:54:04.940 --> 01:54:08.690
<v Speaker 2>So then five years after that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I brought it up again when I bumped into</v>

2246
01:54:08.691 --> 01:54:10.910
<v Speaker 2>him and then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2247
01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:12.613
<v Speaker 2>last I checked the titanic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>titanic has earned more than a billion </v>

2248
01:54:15.141 --> 01:54:15.974
<v Speaker 2>dollars worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine how much more it would have </v>

2249
01:54:18.351 --> 01:54:23.351
<v Speaker 2>earned if I'd gotten the sky correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a stupid answer from an asshole.</v>

2250
01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:25.800
<v Speaker 2>It was as it should be tweeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2251
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:28.310
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that is an asshole.</v>

2252
01:54:28.311 --> 01:54:29.530
<v Speaker 2>And listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's wait.</v>

2253
01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:31.670
<v Speaker 2>That's an ego answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the end of the story.</v>

2254
01:54:31.740 --> 01:54:34.100
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was okay.</v>

2255
01:54:34.101 --> 01:54:36.740
<v Speaker 2>I have nothing more I can say here </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's right.</v>

2256
01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:37.731
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2257
01:54:37.731 --> 01:54:39.210
<v Speaker 2>he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's right now.</v>

2258
01:54:39.230 --> 01:54:40.063
<v Speaker 2>He made it a lot of money and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would've made the same amount of money </v>

2259
01:54:42.940 --> 01:54:44.810
<v Speaker 2>with the correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

2260
01:54:44.811 --> 01:54:47.180
<v Speaker 2>But that's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's crazy fucked up,</v>

2261
01:54:47.181 --> 01:54:49.060
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucked up.</v>

2262
01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:50.810
<v Speaker 2>You fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't say how much money.</v>

2263
01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:54.230
<v Speaker 2>A week later I got a phone call so high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot his name.</v>

2264
01:54:54.231 --> 01:54:55.064
<v Speaker 2>Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hi John.</v>

2265
01:54:55.160 --> 01:54:56.360
<v Speaker 2>How can I help you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this the dot types?</v>

2266
01:54:56.370 --> 01:55:01.370
<v Speaker 2>I said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said I work post production for James</v>

2267
01:55:01.760 --> 01:55:02.593
<v Speaker 2>Cameron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's producing a director's cut where </v>

2268
01:55:04.851 --> 01:55:08.660
<v Speaker 2>he's adding new footage and he tells me </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a sky he could use.</v>

2269
01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:16.640
<v Speaker 2>So this centennial release of titanic </v>
<v Speaker 2>released in April 2012 w dot the w.</v>

2270
01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:23.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

2271
01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how'd you pick up that?</v>

2272
01:55:26.970 --> 01:55:27.803
<v Speaker 2>There was a April 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you and I had this </v>

2273
01:55:30.051 --> 01:55:31.700
<v Speaker 2>conversation because we might have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might have.</v>

2274
01:55:31.701 --> 01:55:34.900
<v Speaker 2>I just put this in context now it's got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So uh,</v>

2275
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:36.930
<v Speaker 2>so he actually put in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he did come through my.</v>

2276
01:55:37.070 --> 01:55:41.120
<v Speaker 2>So here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seth Macfarlane calls me up and said,</v>

2277
01:55:41.570 --> 01:55:42.403
<v Speaker 2>I'm making a movie about a talking teddy</v>
<v Speaker 2>bear and I need to know the sky over a </v>

2278
01:55:47.371 --> 01:55:52.371
<v Speaker 2>town outside of Boston in 1985 on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas eve looking north,</v>

2279
01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:56.760
<v Speaker 2>northeast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got a sky.</v>

2280
01:55:56.830 --> 01:55:58.460
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll get back to you.</v>

2281
01:55:58.500 --> 01:55:59.333
<v Speaker 2>Half hour later I sent him the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the sky that the kid wished on </v>

2282
01:56:03.070 --> 01:56:06.110
<v Speaker 2>to forward where Ted came to life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2283
01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:11.010
<v Speaker 2>So Ted had the correct Scott and titanic</v>
<v Speaker 2>did not.</v>

2284
01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:15.360
<v Speaker 2>So correcting these Ted one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>titanic zero on that.</v>

2285
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:16.343
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the point is that people started </v>

2286
01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:19.493
<v Speaker 2>thinking about it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the highest compliment I ever got was a </v>

2287
01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:23.453
<v Speaker 2>Andy Weir who wrote the Martian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said to himself while he was writing </v>

2288
01:56:27.301 --> 01:56:28.740
<v Speaker 2>the novel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2289
01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:29.753
<v Speaker 2>because he's an engineer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he has the fluency and he's also </v>

2290
01:56:31.741 --> 01:56:35.340
<v Speaker 2>knows how to write a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a write creatively.</v>

2291
01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:39.210
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if Tyson we're looking over my shoulder,</v>

2292
01:56:39.690 --> 01:56:41.970
<v Speaker 2>what would he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would he tweet about this or not?</v>

2293
01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:47.550
<v Speaker 2>And so that put them on notice to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure that his calculations were accurate</v>

2294
01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:49.133
<v Speaker 2>and the Martian is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>entertainingly accurate explorations of </v>

2295
01:56:52.891 --> 01:56:55.980
<v Speaker 2>how to invoke science to not die that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there ever was.</v>

2296
01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:57.113
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a very high compliment and it </v>

2297
01:56:58.471 --> 01:57:01.500
<v Speaker 2>was kind of worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of the naysayers that to know that,</v>

2298
01:57:01.590 --> 01:57:02.580
<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andy,</v>

2299
01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:04.650
<v Speaker 2>we're came through on that.</v>

2300
01:57:05.730 --> 01:57:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why stop?</v>

2301
01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:08.553
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you.</v>

2302
01:57:08.670 --> 01:57:12.000
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'll change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you need to drop.</v>

2303
01:57:12.250 --> 01:57:16.280
<v Speaker 2>Just think about it like this post and </v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

2304
01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:18.110
<v Speaker 2>walk away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk away.</v>

2305
01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Go do something else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2306
01:57:19.650 --> 01:57:20.483
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to look at that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to look at what people </v>

2307
01:57:22.621 --> 01:57:25.350
<v Speaker 2>are going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make sure that there's no typos.</v>

2308
01:57:25.351 --> 01:57:26.700
<v Speaker 2>That's always a struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2309
01:57:26.701 --> 01:57:27.151
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2310
01:57:27.151 --> 01:57:28.110
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that amazing?</v>

2311
01:57:28.111 --> 01:57:28.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got fat.</v>

2312
01:57:28.711 --> 01:57:29.411
<v Speaker 2>Thumbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Too.</v>

2313
01:57:29.411 --> 01:57:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2314
01:57:30.650 --> 01:57:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I care though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you do.</v>

2315
01:57:33.070 --> 01:57:37.950
<v Speaker 2>About what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how people can think about what I wrote.</v>

2316
01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:41.800
<v Speaker 2>If it's a way that I had not considered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2317
01:57:42.290 --> 01:57:43.123
<v Speaker 2>I like knowing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes me a better communicator when </v>

2318
01:57:45.661 --> 01:57:46.494
<v Speaker 2>I'm in front of an audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll know what percent will think one </v>

2319
01:57:48.931 --> 01:57:53.160
<v Speaker 2>way versus another and I can modify what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying to be more precise and to,</v>

2320
01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:54.330
<v Speaker 2>as we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in physics,</v>

2321
01:57:54.331 --> 01:57:55.164
<v Speaker 2>to reduce the impedance between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>signal and the receiver so that there's </v>

2322
01:57:58.651 --> 01:58:02.310
<v Speaker 2>a better match between the communicator </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the audience.</v>

2323
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.863
<v Speaker 2>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you surely have told jokes that </v>

2324
01:58:06.301 --> 01:58:09.900
<v Speaker 2>people just took the wrong way the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

2325
01:58:09.930 --> 01:58:12.350
<v Speaker 2>they just didn't like what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2326
01:58:12.990 --> 01:58:17.990
<v Speaker 2>but it's surely like you see the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>cock in a response,</v>

2327
01:58:18.091 --> 01:58:20.010
<v Speaker 2>you know that person's an asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2328
01:58:20.040 --> 01:58:23.160
<v Speaker 2>There's certain things you just see like</v>
<v Speaker 2>your cook,</v>

2329
01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:24.263
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2330
01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:26.930
<v Speaker 2>I love to listen to anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I know what you are full.</v>

2331
01:58:27.590 --> 01:58:28.423
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you see that like you're stoned all </v>

2332
01:58:30.231 --> 01:58:34.050
<v Speaker 2>the time staring at the fucking sky </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of filling the blank.</v>

2333
01:58:34.530 --> 01:58:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Those are just assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2334
01:58:35.821 --> 01:58:38.520
<v Speaker 2>I have pretty thick skin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not that it upsets me.</v>

2335
01:58:38.521 --> 01:58:39.354
<v Speaker 2>It's that I'm here to serve you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to piss you off when you're not </v>

2336
01:58:41.501 --> 01:58:44.020
<v Speaker 2>there to serve as an educator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some people,</v>

2337
01:58:44.021 --> 01:58:46.500
<v Speaker 2>I'm an educator there are looking to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>angry.</v>

2338
01:58:47.050 --> 01:58:47.883
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I can bring them around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can the arrogance of thinking </v>

2339
01:58:53.681 --> 01:58:54.514
<v Speaker 2>that you could fix 30 plus years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>worthless shitbag living with a couple </v>

2340
01:58:58.871 --> 01:59:03.871
<v Speaker 2>of tweets and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2341
01:59:04.241 --> 01:59:07.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to take you up on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge because you're probably right.</v>

2342
01:59:07.690 --> 01:59:10.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta you gotta walk away.</v>

2343
01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:13.390
<v Speaker 2>But for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself included in those,</v>

2344
01:59:13.391 --> 01:59:15.040
<v Speaker 2>most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy those tweets.</v>

2345
01:59:15.041 --> 01:59:16.570
<v Speaker 2>So I got one something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's one.</v>

2346
01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:17.433
<v Speaker 2>So I tweeted something and somebody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>responding to somebody else's tweet </v>

2347
01:59:20.141 --> 01:59:21.750
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2348
01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:24.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really like Tyson.</v>

2349
01:59:24.551 --> 01:59:26.380
<v Speaker 2>He's such,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so pompous.</v>

2350
01:59:26.930 --> 01:59:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2351
01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:33.190
<v Speaker 2>so I tweeted back to that person and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

2352
01:59:35.230 --> 01:59:36.063
<v Speaker 2>thanks for your note.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you please share with me the </v>

2353
01:59:39.131 --> 01:59:42.970
<v Speaker 2>single most pompous thing you've ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen me do?</v>

2354
01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:47.470
<v Speaker 2>And he wrote back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>damn,</v>

2355
01:59:47.471 --> 01:59:52.270
<v Speaker 2>you would have to be reading my tweets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you got now you put me on the spot.</v>

2356
01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:56.470
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of anything right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but overall I really like your work.</v>

2357
01:59:57.590 --> 01:59:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Keep putting nothing forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

01:59:59.441 --> 02:00:02.040
<v Speaker 2>that happens all the time because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>were just shocked that you respond well.</v>

2359
02:00:02.041 --> 02:00:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2360
02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:03.303
<v Speaker 2>but plus there is people can get into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stereotype mode where there's go that </v>

2361
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:10.020
<v Speaker 2>person is that and therefore everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just decide.</v>

2362
02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:12.280
<v Speaker 2>That's the lead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Decide they decide.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2365
02:00:15.890 --> 02:00:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Too Smart for this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>How pompous is that?</v>

2368
02:00:21.970 --> 02:00:23.700
<v Speaker 2>That's not right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I guess you were one of my guests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so too was Katy Perry.</v>

2371

<v Speaker 2>Anglian and I wanted to find out what </v>

2375

<v Speaker 2>she was thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I didn't know any of this.</v>

2392

<v Speaker 2>They were married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know this.</v>

2396
02:01:29.710 --> 02:01:31.230

<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>

2397
02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:34.520
<v Speaker 2>he's out there and he'd be like one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys that would be in um,</v>

2398
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:38.670
<v Speaker 2>in men in black aliens that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>tracking to,</v>

2399
02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:40.640
<v Speaker 2>to remember that scene in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>headquarters.</v>

2400
02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:43.480
<v Speaker 2>There's a big brides were to cover </v>
<v Speaker 2>aliens,</v>

2401
02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:45.620
<v Speaker 2>aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

2402
02:01:45.621 --> 02:01:46.454
<v Speaker 2>Michael Jackson was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who just do something a little </v>

2403
02:01:48.801 --> 02:01:50.150
<v Speaker 2>different about them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2404
02:01:50.540 --> 02:01:51.373
<v Speaker 2>So there's people that really do believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the believed that there's aliens </v>

2405
02:01:54.111 --> 02:01:57.080
<v Speaker 2>amongst us again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we learned a free country.</v>

2406
02:01:57.230 --> 02:02:00.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what happens?</v>

2407
02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:02.430
<v Speaker 2>Evidence at some point should matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>

2408
02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:03.273
<v Speaker 2>you find out about like Russian agents </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have been living in New Jersey for </v>

2409
02:02:07.521 --> 02:02:08.354
<v Speaker 2>like 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole premise of the </v>

2410
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:10.940
<v Speaker 2>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Americans.</v>

2411
02:02:10.940 --> 02:02:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real story to.</v>

2412
02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:16.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean really has happened on multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>occasions and so they wonder,</v>

2413
02:02:16.760 --> 02:02:18.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the Russians were wanting to do that,</v>

2414
02:02:18.710 --> 02:02:21.470
<v Speaker 2>what are the aliens willing to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2415
02:02:21.471 --> 02:02:23.240
<v Speaker 2>So just find me one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2416
02:02:23.630 --> 02:02:26.210
<v Speaker 2>maybe there are doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you open minded to that course?</v>

2417
02:02:26.270 --> 02:02:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2418
02:02:27.450 --> 02:02:31.430
<v Speaker 2>Who doesn't want to be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I would love to meet the aliens.</v>

2419
02:02:31.610 --> 02:02:34.220
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have technology that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to compare notes.</v>

2420
02:02:34.370 --> 02:02:36.470
<v Speaker 2>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>

2421
02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:37.431
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

2422
02:02:37.431 --> 02:02:42.260
<v Speaker 2>in the movie arrival with the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which one?</v>

2423
02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:44.900
<v Speaker 2>The arthropod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All this.</v>

2424
02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:45.753
<v Speaker 2>And there's two arrivals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's an earlier rather with </v>

2425
02:02:46.971 --> 02:02:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Sheen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He played an astrophysicist by.</v>

2426
02:02:49.230 --> 02:02:50.720
<v Speaker 2>That's a good one too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this one,</v>

2427
02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:51.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2428
02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:53.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a Septa puss.</v>

2429
02:02:53.610 --> 02:02:57.110
<v Speaker 2>Lands freaky things with speaking inc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2430
02:02:57.111 --> 02:02:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Speaking ink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2431
02:02:58.310 --> 02:02:59.143
<v Speaker 2>SO,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they sent the physicist and an </v>

2432
02:03:02.271 --> 02:03:04.660
<v Speaker 2>anthropologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anthropologists a,</v>

2433
02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:08.450
<v Speaker 2>a linguist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I tweeted,</v>

2434
02:03:08.451 --> 02:03:09.550
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2435
02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:12.180
<v Speaker 2>if aliens come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would not send a physicist and link in</v>

2436
02:03:12.190 --> 02:03:13.023
<v Speaker 2>a linguist.</v>

2437
02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:14.293
<v Speaker 2>I would Send it up an astrobiologist and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cryptographer and but then the </v>

2438
02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:27.340
<v Speaker 2>linguists got all upset and they started</v>
<v Speaker 2>piling,</v>

2439
02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:30.680
<v Speaker 2>piling the pile pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's not a linguist.</v>

2440
02:03:30.681 --> 02:03:32.280
<v Speaker 2>She was a witch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's,</v>

2441
02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:35.690
<v Speaker 2>if you're an anthropological linguist or</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they all are.</v>

2442
02:03:35.691 --> 02:03:38.720
<v Speaker 2>But could you just look up the title,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what her profession was?</v>

2443
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:39.790
<v Speaker 2>But anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2444
02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:41.840
<v Speaker 2>so they all piled on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>piled on.</v>

2445
02:03:41.841 --> 02:03:42.620
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

2446
02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:46.130
<v Speaker 2>I will accept because how many linguists</v>
<v Speaker 2>are ever shown in the film.</v>

2447
02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:49.970
<v Speaker 2>So this was their time and the sun is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big moment so I get it.</v>

2448
02:03:49.971 --> 02:03:52.370
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there a couple of things.</v>

2449
02:03:52.580 --> 02:03:53.413
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there it is making these circles and </v>

2450
02:03:55.551 --> 02:03:57.950
<v Speaker 2>they're interpreting them but it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>making them on glass.</v>

2451
02:03:57.951 --> 02:03:59.570
<v Speaker 2>So how do they know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We weRen't seeing them.</v>

2452
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:01.183
<v Speaker 2>the mirror image of what he was trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to communicate that that was not </v>

2453
02:04:03.621 --> 02:04:04.520
<v Speaker 2>addressed in the film.</v>

2454
02:04:04.870 --> 02:04:05.703
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd want to meet the alienS as they did </v>

2455
02:04:07.911 --> 02:04:08.744
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They bought the military of course that </v>

2456
02:04:09.501 --> 02:04:10.334
<v Speaker 2>it will be a likely fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because your protection is of </v>

2457
02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:13.933
<v Speaker 2>extreme importance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here this happens in all scifi </v>

2458
02:04:17.170 --> 02:04:18.003
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go up to this thing and you get </v>

2459
02:04:18.831 --> 02:04:19.664
<v Speaker 2>lifted up against the force of gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At that point I would just put down all </v>

2460
02:04:22.431 --> 02:04:25.760
<v Speaker 2>my weapons because stuff going on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

2461
02:04:25.761 --> 02:04:28.370
<v Speaker 2>beyond your understanding of the laws of</v>
<v Speaker 2>physics,</v>

2462
02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:29.893
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like pulling out your pistol and </v>

2463
02:04:31.251 --> 02:04:34.830
<v Speaker 2>shooting at the spacecraft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They crossed half the galaxy to,</v>

2464
02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:36.830
<v Speaker 2>to come to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

2465
02:04:37.450 --> 02:04:42.000
<v Speaker 2>They are clearly superior to you in ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you don't even know yet.</v>

2466
02:04:42.750 --> 02:04:43.583
<v Speaker 2>So just find another way to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking rather than sending </v>

2467
02:04:46.261 --> 02:04:47.094
<v Speaker 2>bullets there way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But isn't that always the case in every </v>

2468
02:04:49.981 --> 02:04:50.751
<v Speaker 2>film?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2469
02:04:50.751 --> 02:04:54.810
<v Speaker 2>it's always part of the narrative is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the primitive people fuck it up for</v>

2470
02:04:54.811 --> 02:04:57.440
<v Speaker 2>the advanced civilization that's coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>here to help us or.</v>

2471
02:04:58.080 --> 02:04:58.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's never been good for the less </v>

2472
02:05:00.630 --> 02:05:03.150
<v Speaker 2>technologically advanced civilization </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>

2473
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:04.380
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

2474
02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:06.740
<v Speaker 2>and going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Currently,</v>

2475
02:05:06.770 --> 02:05:08.100
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>undiscovered tribes.</v>

2476
02:05:08.280 --> 02:05:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Not to sound pluggy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>

2477
02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:14.460
<v Speaker 2>one of the profiles here is of captain </v>
<v Speaker 2>cook.</v>

2478
02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a quick thing.</v>

2479
02:05:17.060 --> 02:05:19.410
<v Speaker 2>I visited Hawaii only a couple of times </v>
<v Speaker 2>in my life.</v>

2480
02:05:19.650 --> 02:05:22.070
<v Speaker 2>One of the times I saw don ho show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2481
02:05:23.370 --> 02:05:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was like,</v>

2482
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:28.180
<v Speaker 2>he only sat down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like big and heavy and old and he</v>

2483
02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:30.210
<v Speaker 2>died a couple of decades ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyhow,</v>

2484
02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:31.733
<v Speaker 2>don ho,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just helps hawaiian stories and one </v>

2485
02:05:34.501 --> 02:05:38.040
<v Speaker 2>of them was about captain cook and pete </v>
<v Speaker 2>that some.</v>

2486
02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:38.871
<v Speaker 2>Someone asks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2487
02:05:38.871 --> 02:05:41.700
<v Speaker 2>what ever happened to captaIn cook?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know how he replies?</v>

2488
02:05:41.701 --> 02:05:45.570
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's ever seen him.</v>

2489
02:05:45.690 --> 02:05:46.523
<v Speaker 2>So people listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's making things like he's picking </v>

2490
02:05:55.860 --> 02:06:00.240
<v Speaker 2>things out of his team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's ever seen captain cook of late.</v>

2491
02:06:00.930 --> 02:06:04.380
<v Speaker 2>So it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rumors are that he was eating by pacific</v>

2492
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:06.690
<v Speaker 2>island natives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that happened to a lot of pirates.</v>

2493
02:06:06.720 --> 02:06:07.553
<v Speaker 2>So watch what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the british send captain cook to the </v>

2494
02:06:10.651 --> 02:06:11.484
<v Speaker 2>south pacific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why will you look at his marching </v>

2495
02:06:14.341 --> 02:06:14.910
<v Speaker 2>orders?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2496
02:06:14.910 --> 02:06:15.743
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there Is what's called a transit of </v>

2497
02:06:16.771 --> 02:06:20.460
<v Speaker 2>venus that's going to take place visible</v>
<v Speaker 2>only from the south pacific.</v>

2498
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.863
<v Speaker 2>This is where earth in our orbit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>venus's in orbit are such that when </v>

2499
02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:25.973
<v Speaker 2>venus passes between us and the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually is exactly between us and </v>

2500
02:06:29.551 --> 02:06:30.630
<v Speaker 2>the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can watch it,</v>

2501
02:06:30.631 --> 02:06:33.540
<v Speaker 2>move the circle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move across the sun surface,</v>

2502
02:06:33.541 --> 02:06:36.620
<v Speaker 2>and did they look at it through a device</v>
<v Speaker 2>to device filters?</v>

2503
02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:37.680
<v Speaker 2>We were fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2504
02:06:38.010 --> 02:06:38.843
<v Speaker 2>so if you measure that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can learn the exact scale of the </v>

2505
02:06:42.691 --> 02:06:43.524
<v Speaker 2>solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you learn deep scientific knowledge </v>

2506
02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:48.810
<v Speaker 2>about how far away the planets are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>how far away the sun is from the earth.</v>

2507
02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:52.230
<v Speaker 2>It was not known with precision before </v>
<v Speaker 2>that measurement was made.</v>

2508
02:06:52.740 --> 02:06:54.900
<v Speaker 2>So captain could goes on this voyage to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>

2509
02:06:55.290 --> 02:06:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a pretty expensive voyage.</v>

2510
02:06:57.810 --> 02:06:58.441
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll wait,</v>

2511
02:06:58.441 --> 02:07:01.110
<v Speaker 2>flip over the marching orders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2512
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:03.000
<v Speaker 2>open the envelope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2513
02:07:03.001 --> 02:07:07.590
<v Speaker 2>while you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use these new navigation techniques that</v>

2514
02:07:07.591 --> 02:07:08.424
<v Speaker 2>use the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moon and stars and map every coastline </v>

2515
02:07:11.521 --> 02:07:15.210
<v Speaker 2>you find and bring that information back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to us.</v>

2516
02:07:16.290 --> 02:07:17.123
<v Speaker 2>Within 10 years of captain cook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>navIgating the south pacific as well as </v>

2517
02:07:20.671 --> 02:07:24.870
<v Speaker 2>the northern coast of of Australia and </v>
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand.</v>

2518
02:07:24.990 --> 02:07:25.823
<v Speaker 2>Within 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>britain took control over those </v>

2519
02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:31.410
<v Speaker 2>coastlines became part of the british </v>
<v Speaker 2>empire,</v>

2520
02:07:32.790 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 2>had gemini at its finest on</v>

2521
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:39.130
<v Speaker 1>the premise that he's observing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about the universe,</v>

2522
02:07:39.970 --> 02:07:43.000
<v Speaker 1>but there was a tandem role that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>played.</v>

2523
02:07:43.450 --> 02:07:44.283
<v Speaker 1>I did not know they knew that much about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cycles of the planets that they </v>

2524
02:07:48.641 --> 02:07:49.474
<v Speaker 1>could be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They knew accurately they could be part </v>

2525
02:07:51.791 --> 02:07:55.630
<v Speaker 1>of the motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the motivation of knowing any of</v>

2526
02:07:55.631 --> 02:07:59.380
<v Speaker 1>this was navigation around the globe was</v>
<v Speaker 1>navigation.</v>

2527
02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:01.390
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to know where you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>on earth?</v>

2528
02:08:01.391 --> 02:08:02.224
<v Speaker 1>You can get your latitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the altitude or the height </v>

2529
02:08:04.001 --> 02:08:04.834
<v Speaker 1>of polaris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the north star above the horizon and </v>

2530
02:08:06.631 --> 02:08:08.110
<v Speaker 1>measure that at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can wait that long.</v>

2531
02:08:08.230 --> 02:08:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Where do you know where you are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>longitude?</v>

2532
02:08:11.230 --> 02:08:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Ships would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be shipwrecked.</v>

2533
02:08:13.690 --> 02:08:14.523
<v Speaker 1>Millions of dollars worth of commerce </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be at the bottom of the ocean </v>

2534
02:08:19.181 --> 02:08:20.980
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't know where coastline</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

2535
02:08:21.560 --> 02:08:23.100
<v Speaker 1>And the only way you can measure </v>
<v Speaker 1>coastline,</v>

2536
02:08:23.300 --> 02:08:27.040
<v Speaker 1>it's if you have good navigational tools</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tactics which involves,</v>

2537
02:08:27.041 --> 02:08:28.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an accurate chronometer,</v>

2538
02:08:28.930 --> 02:08:32.440
<v Speaker 1>a timekeeping device for your pre and </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing what the sun,</v>

2539
02:08:32.441 --> 02:08:34.270
<v Speaker 1>moon and stars are doing in your sky.</v>

2540
02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:39.960
<v Speaker 1>So the astronomer In that day was </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucial to the mapping of the earth.</v>

2541
02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:43.120
<v Speaker 1>And whose mapping?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it just geologists for fun?</v>

2542
02:08:43.150 --> 02:08:43.983
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is nations wielding power over </v>

2543
02:08:47.951 --> 02:08:51.420
<v Speaker 1>regions beyond the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond their own coastlines.</v>

2544
02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:54.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a quote here.</v>

2545
02:08:54.700 --> 02:08:58.960
<v Speaker 1>That's where this quote comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a guy from 17 whenever I got here,</v>

2546
02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:01.330
<v Speaker 1>1757,</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Ferguson,</v>

2547
02:09:02.680 --> 02:09:04.120
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>57.</v>

2548
02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Here's this quote of all the sciences </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultivated by mankind.</v>

2549
02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Astronomy is acknowledged to be and </v>
<v Speaker 1>undoubtedly is the most sublime,</v>

2550
02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:14.493
<v Speaker 1>the most interesting and the most useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>for by knowledge derived from this </v>

2551
02:09:18.791 --> 02:09:19.624
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only the bulk of the earth is </v>

2552
02:09:22.751 --> 02:09:25.210
<v Speaker 1>discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are very.</v>

2553
02:09:25.211 --> 02:09:26.044
<v Speaker 1>Faculties are enlarged with the grandeur</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the idea as it conveys our minds </v>

2554
02:09:30.161 --> 02:09:34.140
<v Speaker 1>exalted above their low contracted </v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudice.</v>

2555
02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:37.030
<v Speaker 1>If I got a drop of a michael now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here you go,</v>

2556
02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:38.260
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drop that mic.</v>

2557
02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:43.180
<v Speaker 1>so notice he lists mapping the earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

2558
02:09:44.020 --> 02:09:47.260
<v Speaker 1>then he talks about how it exalts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>our grander.</v>

2559
02:09:47.920 --> 02:09:49.900
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2560
02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:52.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an exercise in dominance,</v>

2561
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:56.740
<v Speaker 1>in hegemony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in power under the guise of studying.</v>

2562
02:09:57.540 --> 02:09:58.373
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not so much,</v>

2563
02:09:58.450 --> 02:10:00.660
<v Speaker 1>it's just they co,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did it together.</v>

2564
02:10:00.730 --> 02:10:04.390
<v Speaker 1>If they matter to one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another part of it,</v>

2565
02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:05.253
<v Speaker 1>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they using a sextant for all this </v>

2566
02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:10.390
<v Speaker 1>sub sexton help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an octet a little earlier.</v>

2567
02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the and the,</v>

2568
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:16.690
<v Speaker 1>the muslims used an astrolabe okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you'd got,</v>

2569
02:10:16.750 --> 02:10:18.850
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the number?</v>

2570
02:10:18.851 --> 02:10:23.851
<v Speaker 1>it's a third or two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot that the fraction around a half</v>

2571
02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:25.293
<v Speaker 1>of all stars that have names in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>night sky have arabic names because in </v>

2572
02:10:30.521 --> 02:10:32.650
<v Speaker 1>the golden age of islam a thousand years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

2573
02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:34.040
<v Speaker 1>navigation was</v>

2574
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:36.710
<v Speaker 2>a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they navigated using astrolabes,</v>

2575
02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:38.450
<v Speaker 2>which is sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2576
02:10:38.510 --> 02:10:42.770
<v Speaker 2>the islamic counterpart to the sextant </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the [inaudible] that were used.</v>

2577
02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:44.860
<v Speaker 2>What does the rest of europe asked her?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Electrolytes.</v>

2578
02:10:44.861 --> 02:10:45.561
<v Speaker 2>A cordial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

2579
02:10:45.561 --> 02:10:46.610
<v Speaker 2>Then they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're works of art.</v>

2580
02:10:46.611 --> 02:10:47.990
<v Speaker 2>They're brass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're etched.</v>

2581
02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:50.420
<v Speaker 2>There was riding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd sell them.</v>

2582
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:54.110
<v Speaker 2>You can buy replica is what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get original fine.</v>

2583
02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:55.070
<v Speaker 2>Astrolabe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2584
02:10:55.210 --> 02:10:56.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What that looks like.</v>

2585
02:10:56.450 --> 02:10:57.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2586
02:10:57.650 --> 02:10:58.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

2587
02:10:58.130 --> 02:11:00.080
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing that hangs down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are different,</v>

2588
02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:04.190
<v Speaker 2>a disc that you can replace depending on</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you are on earth to be,</v>

2589
02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:08.960
<v Speaker 2>to know where you are more accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is all navigation so that it was</v>

2590
02:11:08.961 --> 02:11:13.130
<v Speaker 2>almost like chips for a gps device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gorgeous.</v>

2591
02:11:13.340 --> 02:11:15.920
<v Speaker 2>They're completely gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2592
02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:16.993
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you'd carry them with you on that </v>

2593
02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:19.640
<v Speaker 2>somewhere you'd go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2594
02:11:19.641 --> 02:11:20.570
<v Speaker 2>Aliens have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2595
02:11:20.571 --> 02:11:21.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2596
02:11:21.050 --> 02:11:24.660
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't otherwise know your </v>
<v Speaker 2>history and look at the size of that,</v>

2597
02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:27.890
<v Speaker 2>that's about the size of a um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a heavyweight,</v>

2598
02:11:28.630 --> 02:11:33.200
<v Speaker 2>a champion's buckle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buckle belt.</v>

2599
02:11:33.260 --> 02:11:34.730
<v Speaker 2>Buckle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that thing doing?</v>

2600
02:11:35.090 --> 02:11:36.140
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2601
02:11:36.141 --> 02:11:38.740
<v Speaker 2>it depends on where you are wondering </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're saying.</v>

2602
02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:41.010
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about this was,</v>

2603
02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:43.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand years ago said you know,</v>

2604
02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:46.310
<v Speaker 2>this 700 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>600 years ago,</v>

2605
02:11:46.311 --> 02:11:50.750
<v Speaker 2>five or the ottoman empire is spreading </v>
<v Speaker 2>their influence and they've got,</v>

2606
02:11:50.810 --> 02:11:53.030
<v Speaker 2>they've got astrolabs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is islam.</v>

2607
02:11:53.250 --> 02:11:54.083
<v Speaker 2>You don't even learn about this in </v>
<v Speaker 2>school because you only hear about the </v>

2608
02:11:56.091 --> 02:11:57.680
<v Speaker 2>rest of europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>christian europe.</v>

2609
02:11:58.670 --> 02:12:01.480
<v Speaker 2>So this mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible looking device.</v>

2610
02:12:01.481 --> 02:12:03.560
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these are dials that turn,</v>

2611
02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:04.453
<v Speaker 2>it looks like under a tattoo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even look like there's a </v>

2612
02:12:08.121 --> 02:12:10.310
<v Speaker 2>rhyme or reason to it with all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>clause and everything.</v>

2613
02:12:10.340 --> 02:12:12.820
<v Speaker 2>It completely looks like art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like some bizarre.</v>

2614
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Looks like an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2615
02:12:14.580 --> 02:12:16.490
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're only listening,</v>

2616
02:12:16.491 --> 02:12:20.450
<v Speaker 2>just just google astroland astrolabe and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then look at any of them.</v>

2617
02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:21.860
<v Speaker 2>That's a primitive and more primitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

2618
02:12:21.870 --> 02:12:24.660
<v Speaker 2>They're simpler one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2619
02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:26.150
<v Speaker 2>and so that's 16.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2620
02:12:26.151 --> 02:12:26.660
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2621
02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:27.493
<v Speaker 2>Oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that one that has the spirit of an </v>

2622
02:12:29.361 --> 02:12:31.690
<v Speaker 2>astro lay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know that if they would have</v>

2623
02:12:31.691 --> 02:12:35.430
<v Speaker 2>called that an astrolabe the others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2624
02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:39.350
<v Speaker 2>they go way back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>

2625
02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:42.080
<v Speaker 2>the most decorated ones are the ones </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the middle east.</v>

2626
02:12:42.890 --> 02:12:43.723
<v Speaker 2>Anyhow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the point is gps is no different from </v>

2627
02:12:49.101 --> 02:12:51.150
<v Speaker 2>the navigation tools in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2628
02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:52.113
<v Speaker 2>in concept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the navigation tools that captain </v>

2629
02:12:54.171 --> 02:12:55.004
<v Speaker 2>cook invoked for britain to then take </v>
<v Speaker 2>control over all the south pacific that </v>

2630
02:12:59.751 --> 02:13:01.400
<v Speaker 2>they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

2631
02:13:01.401 --> 02:13:06.401
<v Speaker 2>where are we and do we know this </v>
<v Speaker 2>information with precision and so,</v>

2632
02:13:07.610 --> 02:13:08.443
<v Speaker 2>and what happens if an enemy force takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>out our gps and we have so much </v>

2633
02:13:13.911 --> 02:13:15.890
<v Speaker 2>dependent on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are we going to do?</v>

2634
02:13:16.220 --> 02:13:20.540
<v Speaker 2>We've got people now worrying about </v>
<v Speaker 2>working on using navigation by pulse.</v>

2635
02:13:20.541 --> 02:13:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Ours can't take those out because those </v>
<v Speaker 2>are cosmic.</v>

2636
02:13:24.260 --> 02:13:25.093
<v Speaker 2>They're sending highly timed pulses that</v>
<v Speaker 2>reach earth in different places on the </v>

2637
02:13:29.121 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 2>sky and by measuring you</v>

2638
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:34.980
<v Speaker 1>can end the time delay between one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>

2639
02:13:35.490 --> 02:13:36.323
<v Speaker 1>You can actually localize yourSelf on </v>
<v Speaker 1>her surface with extremely high </v>

2640
02:13:39.121 --> 02:13:41.790
<v Speaker 1>precision and without any use of </v>
<v Speaker 1>satellites.</v>

2641
02:13:42.930 --> 02:13:43.763
<v Speaker 1>That's the future of navigation where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were insulated from a rogue nation </v>

2642
02:13:47.281 --> 02:13:50.300
<v Speaker 1>that might want to take out your </v>
<v Speaker 1>satellites hole size pulsars.</v>

2643
02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:52.620
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trump space force,</v>

2644
02:13:52.650 --> 02:13:53.483
<v Speaker 1>you know the many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole lot of trump haters out there </v>

2645
02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:57.473
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to hate trump </v>

2646
02:13:59.101 --> 02:14:01.800
<v Speaker 1>rationally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to not hate them no matter what</v>

2647
02:14:01.801 --> 02:14:02.634
<v Speaker 1>he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to evaluate statement by </v>

2648
02:14:03.871 --> 02:14:05.250
<v Speaker 1>statement what he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2649
02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:06.630
<v Speaker 1>That's what you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

2650
02:14:06.631 --> 02:14:08.130
<v Speaker 1>I want a space for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2651
02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:09.660
<v Speaker 1>let's think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

2652
02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:13.410
<v Speaker 1>In the Second world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was the air force,</v>

2653
02:14:13.411 --> 02:14:16.890
<v Speaker 1>except they were not their own branch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were part of the army.</v>

2654
02:14:16.891 --> 02:14:17.724
<v Speaker 1>It was called the army air force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we realized that command and </v>

2655
02:14:20.161 --> 02:14:20.994
<v Speaker 1>control in the air needs different kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of soldiers though because they have to </v>

2656
02:14:24.391 --> 02:14:25.200
<v Speaker 1>be pilots.</v>

2657
02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:27.180
<v Speaker 1>It's a different kind of decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>

2658
02:14:27.330 --> 02:14:28.163
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of tactical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually actions you would have in </v>

2659
02:14:31.381 --> 02:14:32.214
<v Speaker 1>the in the theater of operations and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was sensible to spawn off a new </v>

2660
02:14:36.661 --> 02:14:39.210
<v Speaker 1>branch of the military called the air </v>
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>

2661
02:14:39.570 --> 02:14:41.910
<v Speaker 1>No one today would question whether that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a good idea.</v>

2662
02:14:43.050 --> 02:14:47.880
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should know that operations in space</v>

2663
02:14:47.881 --> 02:14:48.714
<v Speaker 1>in the vacuum of the universe is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different regime that you're operating </v>

2664
02:14:53.671 --> 02:14:56.680
<v Speaker 1>in from moving through the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hardware,</v>

2665
02:14:56.681 --> 02:14:58.120
<v Speaker 1>it looks different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2666
02:14:58.150 --> 02:15:00.570
<v Speaker 1>your strategies are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your decision,</v>

2667
02:15:00.660 --> 02:15:04.980
<v Speaker 1>your command and control is different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a credit.</v>

2668
02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:05.833
<v Speaker 1>Just because it came out of trump's </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth doesn't make it a crazy idea that </v>

2669
02:15:08.311 --> 02:15:10.500
<v Speaker 1>you might want a space for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2670
02:15:10.501 --> 02:15:11.334
<v Speaker 1>I had proposed the space for us in 2001 </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was on a commission appointed by </v>

2671
02:15:16.141 --> 02:15:21.060
<v Speaker 1>george w dot bush to explore the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the United States space.</v>

2672
02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Aerospace industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A commission of 12.</v>

2673
02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:25.980
<v Speaker 1>So I put it on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have air force generals,</v>

2674
02:15:26.080 --> 02:15:26.913
<v Speaker 1>they're former members of congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people from lockheed martin and people </v>

2675
02:15:31.981 --> 02:15:32.640
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2676
02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:37.640
<v Speaker 1>the air force is currently overseeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>space United States space command,</v>

2677
02:15:37.891 --> 02:15:39.750
<v Speaker 1>so everybody was happy with it and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>

2678
02:15:39.751 --> 02:15:40.270
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2679
02:15:40.270 --> 02:15:41.103
<v Speaker 1>let's not worry about it if everybody's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as if as long as this needs of our </v>

2680
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.863
<v Speaker 1>presence in space grows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more importantly the size of our </v>

2681
02:15:48.961 --> 02:15:52.080
<v Speaker 1>assets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as that continues to grow,</v>

2682
02:15:52.890 --> 02:15:55.860
<v Speaker 1>what else would the military do beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting your borders?</v>

2683
02:15:55.861 --> 02:15:58.200
<v Speaker 1>They would protect your assets and our </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

2684
02:15:58.210 --> 02:15:59.043
<v Speaker 1>Assets by day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>day by day are growing by leaps and </v>

2685
02:16:02.341 --> 02:16:03.174
<v Speaker 1>bounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as not assets meaning like satellite </v>

2686
02:16:05.441 --> 02:16:07.410
<v Speaker 1>satellite station and the value of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

2687
02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:08.273
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the cost of the satellite </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the value that's at the satellite to </v>

2688
02:16:10.681 --> 02:16:11.514
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2689
02:16:12.280 --> 02:16:12.980
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2690
02:16:12.980 --> 02:16:13.813
<v Speaker 1>the military is now creating a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>other gps system that will be exclusive </v>

2691
02:16:16.711 --> 02:16:17.544
<v Speaker 1>to them and then they're going to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>the current gps to an and what have we </v>

2692
02:16:21.361 --> 02:16:25.320
<v Speaker 1>done with gps?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This hard earned engineering and physics</v>

2693
02:16:26.100 --> 02:16:28.560
<v Speaker 1>and orbital mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What have we done with the gps?</v>

2694
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:32.530
<v Speaker 1>We now use it to find out who you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to mate with.</v>

2695
02:16:33.610 --> 02:16:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's in your area.</v>

2696
02:16:35.590 --> 02:16:37.960
<v Speaker 1>This is tinder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is grinder that says,</v>

2697
02:16:37.961 --> 02:16:42.850
<v Speaker 1>show me mateaBle people within 20 square</v>
<v Speaker 1>blocks of where I am.</v>

2698
02:16:42.880 --> 02:16:45.200
<v Speaker 1>that's a gps on grindr.</v>

2699
02:16:48.830 --> 02:16:50.020
<v Speaker 1>I did look up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The definition of mate,</v>

2700
02:16:50.021 --> 02:16:53.620
<v Speaker 1>mate implies you're making a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are you going to have sex with?</v>

2701
02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2702
02:16:55.210 --> 02:16:56.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so so that has a certain economic value </v>

2703
02:16:58.961 --> 02:17:01.030
<v Speaker 1>to society and sodas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uber,</v>

2704
02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:02.013
<v Speaker 1>so to all the things that sodas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ups tracking their trucks so it's not </v>

2705
02:17:05.681 --> 02:17:06.514
<v Speaker 1>the cost of the satellites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the value of the satellite to our </v>

2706
02:17:08.171 --> 02:17:10.270
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd want that protected.</v>

2707
02:17:10.690 --> 02:17:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a space for us currently?</v>

2708
02:17:13.020 --> 02:17:13.853
<v Speaker 1>Like is it real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they recruited as United States </v>

2709
02:17:15.041 --> 02:17:17.350
<v Speaker 1>space command,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anybody who was a general,</v>

2710
02:17:17.380 --> 02:17:18.213
<v Speaker 1>if we make a space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're generals in the air force </v>

2711
02:17:19.601 --> 02:17:20.434
<v Speaker 1>overseeing space command,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're going to make a space </v>

2712
02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:25.120
<v Speaker 1>force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would offload,</v>

2713
02:17:25.420 --> 02:17:26.253
<v Speaker 1>you would offload the space activities </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the air force space command to this </v>

2714
02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:30.663
<v Speaker 1>us space command primarily to the space </v>
<v Speaker 1>force and then add or subtract from </v>

2715
02:17:35.531 --> 02:17:35.800
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2716
02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:37.600
<v Speaker 1>In whatever way is sensible given the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neat.</v>

2717
02:17:37.810 --> 02:17:38.950
<v Speaker 1>If we have a space for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

2718
02:17:38.951 --> 02:17:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what I want them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect us from asteroids.</v>

2719
02:17:41.950 --> 02:17:44.270
<v Speaker 1>How about that for defense program?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

2720
02:17:44.290 --> 02:17:45.123
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want the government involved in </v>

2721
02:17:45.581 --> 02:17:46.414
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't be someone a little bit more </v>

2722
02:17:47.081 --> 02:17:48.940
<v Speaker 1>thorough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not how it works.</v>

2723
02:17:49.440 --> 02:17:50.273
<v Speaker 1>It's not scientists you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just made you made a blanket </v>

2724
02:17:53.050 --> 02:17:56.280
<v Speaker 1>antigovernment decision because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>just antigovernment guy.</v>

2725
02:17:56.310 --> 02:17:57.280
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2726
02:17:57.580 --> 02:17:58.413
<v Speaker 1>so I'm private.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enterprise is not good at doing </v>

2727
02:18:06.251 --> 02:18:08.440
<v Speaker 1>expensive things that have never been </v>
<v Speaker 1>done before.</v>

2728
02:18:08.550 --> 02:18:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Need government money?</v>

2729
02:18:09.880 --> 02:18:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Government government does it first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2730
02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you learn where the hostels are,</v>

2731
02:18:14.921 --> 02:18:16.380
<v Speaker 1>where the friendlies are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the.</v>

2732
02:18:16.530 --> 02:18:18.760
<v Speaker 1>What patent did you need to make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>

2733
02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:22.410
<v Speaker 1>then the venture capitalists meeting </v>
<v Speaker 1>about whether I'm going to make a bucket</v>

2734
02:18:22.411 --> 02:18:23.950
<v Speaker 1>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has some,</v>

2735
02:18:24.190 --> 02:18:26.020
<v Speaker 1>has some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some teeth in it.</v>

2736
02:18:26.260 --> 02:18:27.400
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much will this cost?</v>

2737
02:18:27.401 --> 02:18:28.234
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know because the government did it </v>

2738
02:18:29.140 --> 02:18:31.030
<v Speaker 1>and we think we can do it for half that </v>
<v Speaker 1>price.</v>

2739
02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Is it dangerous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2740
02:18:32.681 --> 02:18:34.750
<v Speaker 1>The government did this and they lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>two people,</v>

2741
02:18:34.990 --> 02:18:37.390
<v Speaker 1>but we will put protections in so we </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't have that risk.</v>

2742
02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:38.433
<v Speaker 1>What is the return on the investment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the government got no return because </v>

2743
02:18:40.751 --> 02:18:43.060
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't the objective,</v>

2744
02:18:43.061 --> 02:18:45.460
<v Speaker 1>but here's how we can bring them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll do it second.</v>

2745
02:18:45.461 --> 02:18:46.330
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At first,</v>

2746
02:18:46.450 --> 02:18:48.940
<v Speaker 1>this is how you get the dutch east India</v>
<v Speaker 1>trading company.</v>

2747
02:18:49.810 --> 02:18:50.643
<v Speaker 1>They were not the first europeans to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>new world because where's the edge of </v>

2748
02:18:53.621 --> 02:18:55.120
<v Speaker 1>the earth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will you find India?</v>

2749
02:18:55.530 --> 02:18:57.880
<v Speaker 1>will you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what you don't know any of this.</v>

2750
02:18:58.910 --> 02:18:59.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm screaming at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

2751
02:19:00.070 --> 02:19:00.903
<v Speaker 1>You don't know any of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbus does it first and he can tell </v>

2752
02:19:03.101 --> 02:19:04.600
<v Speaker 1>you where there's food and where there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>

2753
02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:06.040
<v Speaker 1>where there isn't and where they want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill you.</v>

2754
02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:06.873
<v Speaker 1>In where they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you hand that information to the </v>

2755
02:19:08.861 --> 02:19:09.694
<v Speaker 1>market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the mercantilists and they make a </v>

2756
02:19:13.481 --> 02:19:16.660
<v Speaker 1>book after the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they come in,</v>

2757
02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:17.720
<v Speaker 1>they come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2758
02:19:17.740 --> 02:19:21.880
<v Speaker 1>that's how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how modern airplanes came about.</v>

2759
02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:24.550
<v Speaker 1>People were making planes in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>garage.</v>

2760
02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:26.500
<v Speaker 1>The government said this could be a cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2761
02:19:26.810 --> 02:19:27.643
<v Speaker 1>Let's pay them and have them compete to </v>
<v Speaker 1>carry airmail new kind of mail mail </v>

2762
02:19:33.591 --> 02:19:35.630
<v Speaker 1>delivered by air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2763
02:19:35.631 --> 02:19:38.660
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I make an airplane because I want</v>

2764
02:19:38.661 --> 02:19:39.740
<v Speaker 1>their contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

2765
02:19:39.741 --> 02:19:40.880
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want the contract.</v>

2766
02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:43.100
<v Speaker 1>You make an airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That ca has more cargo,</v>

2767
02:19:43.490 --> 02:19:45.950
<v Speaker 1>a better engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're cleverer now.</v>

2768
02:19:45.951 --> 02:19:46.784
<v Speaker 1>You just took the contract from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I make a bigger airplane because I </v>

2769
02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:50.271
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2770
02:19:50.271 --> 02:19:52.670
<v Speaker 1>I see what he did there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now I can improve on that.</v>

2771
02:19:52.940 --> 02:19:54.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

2772
02:19:54.800 --> 02:19:55.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to carry mail.</v>

2773
02:19:56.870 --> 02:20:01.870
<v Speaker 1>I can carry people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thus is born commercial airport,</v>

2774
02:20:03.020 --> 02:20:03.853
<v Speaker 1>airplane government basically bankrolled</v>
<v Speaker 1>it as did as did a prize money for </v>

2775
02:20:10.071 --> 02:20:14.450
<v Speaker 1>accomplishing certain achievements like </v>
<v Speaker 1>lindbergh.</v>

2776
02:20:14.780 --> 02:20:15.613
<v Speaker 1>No one talks about the fact that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was cash money available to him for </v>

2777
02:20:18.441 --> 02:20:23.060
<v Speaker 1>having done a flowing across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>atlantic solo first cash money.</v>

2778
02:20:23.720 --> 02:20:24.170
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2779
02:20:24.170 --> 02:20:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I did it for the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2780
02:20:25.610 --> 02:20:28.160
<v Speaker 1>As most of them did fly the longest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest,</v>

2781
02:20:28.161 --> 02:20:28.994
<v Speaker 1>the fastest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of these had money associated with </v>

2782
02:20:30.861 --> 02:20:33.770
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this drove the marketplace.</v>

2783
02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:34.993
<v Speaker 1>It was not whether you could make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>product out of it initially because you </v>

2784
02:20:38.671 --> 02:20:39.504
<v Speaker 1>got to get over the early humps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get through to get to know </v>

2785
02:20:42.801 --> 02:20:47.680
<v Speaker 1>what it is that works and what doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is there a plan with the space for so</v>

2786
02:20:47.681 --> 02:20:51.620
<v Speaker 1>like are they gonna make space weapons </v>
<v Speaker 1>and space ships.</v>

2787
02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:54.800
<v Speaker 1>There's a treaty in 19 sixties to which </v>
<v Speaker 1>we are signature.</v>

2788
02:20:55.230 --> 02:20:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I talk about intercessory to war.</v>

2789
02:20:57.920 --> 02:20:58.790
<v Speaker 1>It's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate.</v>

2790
02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I feel so bad doing this plugin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2791
02:21:01.250 --> 02:21:02.690
<v Speaker 1>I feel so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me hold it.</v>

2792
02:21:02.810 --> 02:21:03.050
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2793
02:21:03.050 --> 02:21:03.830
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hold it?</v>

2794
02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2795
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:07.130
<v Speaker 1>I just feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2796
02:21:07.220 --> 02:21:08.053
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the unspoken alliance between </v>

2797
02:21:12.290 --> 02:21:15.390
<v Speaker 1>astrophysics and the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look beautiful with that.</v>

2798
02:21:16.250 --> 02:21:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Primarily because there is a bow and </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrow here being shot by sagittarius.</v>

2799
02:21:20.570 --> 02:21:24.810
<v Speaker 1>That became a weapon on a missile at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>10.</v>

2800
02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:27.090
<v Speaker 1>You're a bone arrow guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What are you afraid of?</v>

2804
02:21:35.400 --> 02:21:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Practice when the zombies come either </v>
<v Speaker 1>run out of bullets.</v>

2805
02:21:40.040 --> 02:21:40.873
<v Speaker 1>Tommy som.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pulling that sorta check from </v>

2806
02:21:42.520 --> 02:21:43.490
<v Speaker 1>walking dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2807
02:21:43.491 --> 02:21:44.540
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best weapon.</v>

2808
02:21:44.541 --> 02:21:45.374
<v Speaker 1>Everybody runs out of bullets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zombies are slow and her weapon is in </v>

2809
02:21:47.481 --> 02:21:49.650
<v Speaker 1>fact this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>

2810
02:21:49.810 --> 02:21:50.643
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what was I saying before I </v>

2811
02:21:52.851 --> 02:21:57.770
<v Speaker 1>interrupted myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nurse who's who's paying attention out</v>

2812
02:21:57.771 --> 02:21:58.170
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

2813
02:21:58.170 --> 02:22:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Weapon asteroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weaponizing space.</v>

2814
02:22:01.551 --> 02:22:02.384
<v Speaker 1>So there's the outer space treaty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a treaty for the peaceful uses of outer </v>

2815
02:22:05.241 --> 02:22:08.990
<v Speaker 1>space and it was in 1967.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some modification since then,</v>

2816
02:22:08.991 --> 02:22:09.824
<v Speaker 1>but that's the basic one and we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>signature to it and so are the other </v>

2817
02:22:12.471 --> 02:22:13.304
<v Speaker 1>major countries of the world and we just</v>
<v Speaker 1>break out of the paris accord break out </v>

2818
02:22:16.311 --> 02:22:20.780
<v Speaker 1>of that god damn space pussy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful document.</v>

2819
02:22:20.850 --> 02:22:21.683
<v Speaker 1>It tries to be very forward looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's an astronaut from another </v>

2820
02:22:24.501 --> 02:22:25.334
<v Speaker 1>country who is at risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you will go to help them without </v>

2821
02:22:28.591 --> 02:22:30.720
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very kumbaya.</v>

2822
02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:33.330
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of my sort of.</v>

2823
02:22:33.331 --> 02:22:37.050
<v Speaker 1>Now that I'm old and tired and I just am</v>
<v Speaker 1>a realist,</v>

2824
02:22:37.440 --> 02:22:38.273
<v Speaker 1>it's why should we promise to not kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other in space when we are not </v>

2825
02:22:44.671 --> 02:22:48.670
<v Speaker 1>successful at doing that here on earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't even promise tonight.</v>

2826
02:22:48.670 --> 02:22:51.020
<v Speaker 1>I promise to do it here on her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2827
02:22:51.270 --> 02:22:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Who are we to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2828
02:22:53.431 --> 02:22:55.020
<v Speaker 1>well we'll kill each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>AnyBody in space,</v>

2829
02:22:55.021 --> 02:23:00.021
<v Speaker 1>we'll all hold hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have that much confidence in</v>

2830
02:23:00.900 --> 02:23:02.890
<v Speaker 1>human conduct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

2831
02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:06.360
<v Speaker 1>I become cynical over my years and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>angry.</v>

2832
02:23:07.050 --> 02:23:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Demonstrate to me that on earth you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to not kill one another,</v>

2833
02:23:10.890 --> 02:23:14.910
<v Speaker 1>then I'll believe your space treaty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm saying here now,</v>

2834
02:23:15.360 --> 02:23:18.510
<v Speaker 1>given that there is a treaty that says </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't put heavy weapons in space,</v>

2835
02:23:18.810 --> 02:23:20.490
<v Speaker 1>as I detail in one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh by the way,</v>

2836
02:23:20.491 --> 02:23:25.170
<v Speaker 1>I have a coauthor on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started doing this 12 years ago and it</v>

2837
02:23:25.171 --> 02:23:26.004
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will never finish this for a thousand </v>

2838
02:23:27.650 --> 02:23:28.770
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought in a coauthor office,</v>

2839
02:23:28.771 --> 02:23:29.604
<v Speaker 1>lang who is a longtime editor of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>essays that I've written for natural </v>

2840
02:23:33.841 --> 02:23:35.850
<v Speaker 1>history magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just give a shout out to my coauthor how</v>

2841
02:23:35.851 --> 02:23:36.540
<v Speaker 1>does that work?</v>

2842
02:23:36.540 --> 02:23:39.420
<v Speaker 1>So in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of takes your stuff and stitches it</v>

2843
02:23:39.421 --> 02:23:41.700
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this particular case,</v>

2844
02:23:42.250 --> 02:23:45.440
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of ways we collaborated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2845
02:23:45.690 --> 02:23:46.523
<v Speaker 1>some of them I just dictated entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>chapters to her and but leaving out </v>

2846
02:23:51.181 --> 02:23:56.181
<v Speaker 1>certain details that would require a </v>
<v Speaker 1>nitty gritty of sort of research just to</v>

2847
02:23:56.371 --> 02:23:59.970
<v Speaker 1>get the right numbers in the right year </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the commander and the write this,</v>

2848
02:23:59.971 --> 02:24:03.360
<v Speaker 1>but I know broadly how it happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>what sequence.</v>

2849
02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:06.300
<v Speaker 1>And so then she would take that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shape that into a chapter.</v>

2850
02:24:06.720 --> 02:24:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Other places I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2851
02:24:08.640 --> 02:24:10.380
<v Speaker 1>this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened and that happened.</v>

2852
02:24:10.620 --> 02:24:11.453
<v Speaker 1>She would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that wouldn't fit the narrative as </v>

2853
02:24:13.141 --> 02:24:13.974
<v Speaker 1>it's coming together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's drop the middle one and take the </v>

2854
02:24:15.631 --> 02:24:16.920
<v Speaker 1>other two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say great.</v>

2855
02:24:16.921 --> 02:24:19.410
<v Speaker 1>So I'd write that up and she would </v>
<v Speaker 1>stitch it.</v>

2856
02:24:19.620 --> 02:24:23.790
<v Speaker 1>She would grafted is a better word into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of what was going on.</v>

2857
02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:24.953
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though there are places here where </v>

2858
02:24:26.881 --> 02:24:28.590
<v Speaker 1>I speak in first person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually,</v>

2859
02:24:28.700 --> 02:24:31.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a co written project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not ghost written,</v>

2860
02:24:31.261 --> 02:24:33.420
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just putting my name,</v>

2861
02:24:33.421 --> 02:24:34.380
<v Speaker 1>but somebody else wrote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2862
02:24:34.390 --> 02:24:35.041
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write,</v>

2863
02:24:35.041 --> 02:24:37.620
<v Speaker 1>I know how to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're co authors on this,</v>

2864
02:24:37.770 --> 02:24:39.030
<v Speaker 1>but thanks for asking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was good.</v>

2865
02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2866
02:24:41.070 --> 02:24:44.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's a problem that we detail here.</v>

2867
02:24:45.120 --> 02:24:47.100
<v Speaker 1>People say I don't want weapons in </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

2868
02:24:48.060 --> 02:24:48.893
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing more useless than a </v>

2869
02:24:50.491 --> 02:24:53.250
<v Speaker 1>space weapon relative to earth's </v>
<v Speaker 1>surface.</v>

2870
02:24:53.780 --> 02:24:54.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're in space,</v>

2871
02:24:54.871 --> 02:24:56.370
<v Speaker 1>you're in orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The think it through.</v>

2872
02:24:56.720 --> 02:24:58.240
<v Speaker 1>If I use your skull here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

2873
02:24:58.270 --> 02:24:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2874
02:24:59.510 --> 02:25:00.800
<v Speaker 1>If this is earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

2875
02:25:03.090 --> 02:25:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Everything more spherical here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess not.</v>

2876
02:25:04.621 --> 02:25:05.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm using your skull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2877
02:25:05.910 --> 02:25:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

2878
02:25:07.860 --> 02:25:08.920
<v Speaker 1>So this is earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2879
02:25:08.940 --> 02:25:13.110
<v Speaker 1>And I've got a satellite in orbit around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth and I say,</v>

2880
02:25:13.111 --> 02:25:15.060
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to weaponize the satellite,</v>

2881
02:25:15.061 --> 02:25:17.280
<v Speaker 1>put a bomb in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I want to drop over some city.</v>

2882
02:25:17.281 --> 02:25:18.114
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some bad person wants to make that </v>

2883
02:25:19.651 --> 02:25:20.480
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2884
02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:21.660
<v Speaker 1>Well what's the city when it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2885
02:25:21.661 --> 02:25:24.070
<v Speaker 1>it's up here somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you to it halfway there.</v>

2886
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:24.933
<v Speaker 1>So you gotta well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that these are not very </v>

2887
02:25:27.851 --> 02:25:28.684
<v Speaker 1>high above the planet and so you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like change the orbit to align it so </v>

2888
02:25:32.531 --> 02:25:35.590
<v Speaker 1>that it goes over your target </v>
<v Speaker 1>satellites.</v>

2889
02:25:35.610 --> 02:25:36.443
<v Speaker 1>Don't go over every spot on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only go over the orbit that had </v>

2890
02:25:39.281 --> 02:25:40.950
<v Speaker 1>print preset for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2891
02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:43.113
<v Speaker 1>we can already destroy a city with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intercontinental ballistic missile and </v>

2892
02:25:46.511 --> 02:25:47.410
<v Speaker 1>we can aim that.</v>

2893
02:25:48.370 --> 02:25:50.830
<v Speaker 1>We can aim a miSsile to any place on </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

2894
02:25:51.010 --> 02:25:51.843
<v Speaker 1>it'll get there in less than 45 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and destroy the whole city with nuclear </v>

2895
02:25:57.191 --> 02:25:59.050
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can already do that.</v>

2896
02:25:59.530 --> 02:26:03.370
<v Speaker 1>There is no advantage to putting nixon </v>
<v Speaker 1>space if that's your objective.</v>

2897
02:26:04.090 --> 02:26:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Not only that supposedly is a rogue </v>
<v Speaker 1>satellite and it's messing with you.</v>

2898
02:26:08.381 --> 02:26:11.590
<v Speaker 1>It's beaming energy particles at you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to take it out.</v>

2899
02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:14.110
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to take it out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to destroy it.</v>

2900
02:26:14.530 --> 02:26:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you break it into a million pieces,</v>

2901
02:26:17.020 --> 02:26:20.170
<v Speaker 1>a thousand pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now each piece is moving 18,000</v>

2902
02:26:20.171 --> 02:26:22.930
<v Speaker 1>miles an hour and put your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>satellites at risk.</v>

2903
02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:26.500
<v Speaker 1>That's the modern equivalent to in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first world war when they said,</v>

2904
02:26:26.530 --> 02:26:27.363
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a good idea because we can't </v>

2905
02:26:28.481 --> 02:26:30.100
<v Speaker 1>shoot them in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the trenches,</v>

2906
02:26:30.250 --> 02:26:33.010
<v Speaker 1>let's get them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have the mustard gas.</v>

2907
02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Oops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wind changed directions and all of a</v>

2908
02:26:36.311 --> 02:26:41.170
<v Speaker 1>sudden you become a victim of your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapon such as what happened in space.</v>

2909
02:26:41.290 --> 02:26:44.530
<v Speaker 1>If you go in and start exploding </v>
<v Speaker 1>satellites out of orbit.</v>

2910
02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:50.520
<v Speaker 1>So war in space is a differenT thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what you think it would be.</v>

2911
02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:55.510
<v Speaker 1>What would they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the outer peaceful use of outer space</v>

2912
02:26:55.900 --> 02:26:59.890
<v Speaker 1>treaty allows you to have defensive pr </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in space,</v>

2913
02:26:59.950 --> 02:27:03.010
<v Speaker 1>not offensive for defensive purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It allows that.</v>

2914
02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:05.340
<v Speaker 1>So treaty aside though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2915
02:27:05.370 --> 02:27:06.310
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What could you do?</v>

2916
02:27:06.460 --> 02:27:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Could you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2917
02:27:07.630 --> 02:27:10.510
<v Speaker 1>could you have a rogue state?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could take out our gps satellites.</v>

2918
02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:11.373
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when render the military blind and </v>

2919
02:27:12.671 --> 02:27:14.050
<v Speaker 1>then you won't be able to pick up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>uber.</v>

2920
02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:15.790
<v Speaker 1>He won't have anyone to have sex with </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>

2921
02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:18.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the range of stuff that gps </v>
<v Speaker 1>applies to.</v>

2922
02:27:18.820 --> 02:27:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it'll affect our economy,</v>

2923
02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:22.133
<v Speaker 1>it'll affect our security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then our navy can't talk to the air </v>

2924
02:27:24.911 --> 02:27:27.040
<v Speaker 1>force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the air force can't talk to her and that</v>

2925
02:27:27.041 --> 02:27:27.874
<v Speaker 1>would Be bad.</v>

2926
02:27:29.300 --> 02:27:30.133
<v Speaker 1>Armies up wars are no longer fought just</v>
<v Speaker 1>by how many soldiers have you lined up </v>

2927
02:27:33.611 --> 02:27:38.611
<v Speaker 1>at the at the border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what have you done strategically to</v>

2928
02:27:38.801 --> 02:27:43.801
<v Speaker 1>render your opponent a to just to render</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2929
02:27:45.010 --> 02:27:48.880
<v Speaker 1>to weaken your opponent or render them </v>
<v Speaker 1>incapable of fighting you.</v>

2930
02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:54.030
<v Speaker 1>This is why the attacks on September </v>
<v Speaker 1>11th worked because we had a policy that</v>

2931
02:27:54.341 --> 02:27:58.450
<v Speaker 1>if someone wants to hijack a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you follow their instructions.</v>

2932
02:27:59.260 --> 02:28:00.093
<v Speaker 1>You do not deny them their requests </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the assumption was that if you </v>

2933
02:28:05.231 --> 02:28:06.064
<v Speaker 1>deny the request,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will start harming people and if </v>

2934
02:28:08.291 --> 02:28:11.620
<v Speaker 1>you follow the requests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will delay when they harm them.</v>

2935
02:28:11.650 --> 02:28:14.470
<v Speaker 1>If they harm them at all and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone will end up Safe.</v>

2936
02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:19.030
<v Speaker 1>It was not in the game plan that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would crash the plane on purpose.</v>

2937
02:28:20.110 --> 02:28:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so September 12th,</v>

2938
02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:26.540
<v Speaker 1>you will never again be able to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the american plane.</v>

2939
02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Forget the extra x rays that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

2940
02:28:30.380 --> 02:28:33.080
<v Speaker 1>A pilot will never relinquish the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cockpit ever again,</v>

2941
02:28:33.620 --> 02:28:37.070
<v Speaker 1>no matter who they're torturing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>back of the back of the plane,</v>

2942
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:38.503
<v Speaker 1>no matter what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's shooting people one by one </v>

2943
02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:42.650
<v Speaker 1>because the plane going down takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody out.</v>

2944
02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:48.610
<v Speaker 1>So that was a pretty easy door to close </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally and figuratively,</v>

2945
02:28:50.390 --> 02:28:51.223
<v Speaker 1>but no one saw it coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what drives me crazy when they </v>

2946
02:28:54.351 --> 02:28:55.184
<v Speaker 1>put that drink cart [inaudible] the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hallway to protect the pilot when they </v>

2947
02:28:59.271 --> 02:29:00.500
<v Speaker 1>opened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked him about that.</v>

2948
02:29:00.501 --> 02:29:01.334
<v Speaker 1>So it's just to delay you a fraction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a second to give them a chance to go in </v>

2949
02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:07.170
<v Speaker 1>and lock the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2950
02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:07.910
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2951
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:10.580
<v Speaker 1>you have to get through them and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>flight attendant,</v>

2952
02:29:11.810 --> 02:29:14.000
<v Speaker 1>that takes an extra second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just run in.</v>

2953
02:29:14.001 --> 02:29:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Plus they don't even allow you to stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the aisle while that's happening.</v>

2954
02:29:17.210 --> 02:29:18.650
<v Speaker 1>They'll tell you to sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sit down.</v>

2955
02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2956
02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:20.083
<v Speaker 1>So you have to get out of your thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>charged the cart and get through the </v>

2957
02:29:24.681 --> 02:29:25.514
<v Speaker 1>cart and the flight attendant who will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be fighting for their life at this </v>

2958
02:29:27.741 --> 02:29:28.880
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2959
02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:32.510
<v Speaker 1>And because the plane is everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2960
02:29:33.710 --> 02:29:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that opening.</v>

2961
02:29:34.791 --> 02:29:35.990
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get through there.</v>

2962
02:29:38.330 --> 02:29:39.880
<v Speaker 1>Those ladies ain't gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop man.</v>

2963
02:29:40.970 --> 02:29:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who really is physically.</v>

2964
02:29:43.580 --> 02:29:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Joe rogan has already thought this </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

2965
02:29:45.870 --> 02:29:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that my mind does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is you can,</v>

2966
02:29:50.510 --> 02:29:52.000
<v Speaker 1>I would never do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you don't.</v>

2967
02:29:52.001 --> 02:29:52.430
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2968
02:29:52.430 --> 02:29:53.263
<v Speaker 1>I thought about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I thought to myself the plane that </v>

2969
02:29:55.551 --> 02:29:58.040
<v Speaker 1>way because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I witnessed a September 11th for blocks,</v>

2970
02:29:58.100 --> 02:30:02.070
<v Speaker 1>six blocks away from a six walking </v>
<v Speaker 1>blocks for digital.</v>

2971
02:30:03.150 --> 02:30:05.150
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that was my view is blocked from</v>

2972
02:30:05.151 --> 02:30:06.440
<v Speaker 1>the south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2973
02:30:06.441 --> 02:30:09.440
<v Speaker 1>but I have a camcorder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>footage of the explosion,</v>

2974
02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:11.970
<v Speaker 1>big explosion I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2975
02:30:12.170 --> 02:30:15.350
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing I noticed is that there was no</v>

2976
02:30:15.420 --> 02:30:16.253
<v Speaker 1>shockwave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might've been the closest to </v>

2977
02:30:17.941 --> 02:30:21.260
<v Speaker 1>scientists to the event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was,</v>

2978
02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:22.273
<v Speaker 1>all I could do was apply every bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics that I know there was no </v>

2979
02:30:24.490 --> 02:30:25.730
<v Speaker 1>shockwave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2980
02:30:25.731 --> 02:30:26.564
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we have an explosion in no </v>

2981
02:30:27.120 --> 02:30:27.953
<v Speaker 1>shockwave?</v>

2982
02:30:28.850 --> 02:30:31.820
<v Speaker 1>And I later learned if you had to kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of make a deflagration wave,</v>

2983
02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.880
<v Speaker 1>if you atomize fuel and then you spark </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2984
02:30:35.390 --> 02:30:38.510
<v Speaker 1>then the flame moves across the fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>

2985
02:30:38.750 --> 02:30:39.583
<v Speaker 1>it's not a shock wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a deflagration wave and </v>

2986
02:30:41.391 --> 02:30:45.800
<v Speaker 1>therefore there's no shockwave and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>windows are not blown out a quarter mile</v>

2987
02:30:45.801 --> 02:30:46.634
<v Speaker 1>away as they were in Oklahoma city with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the giant bombed with him today to </v>

2988
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:53.090
<v Speaker 1>timothy mcveigh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A read.</v>

2989
02:30:53.690 --> 02:30:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Why am I bringing this up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2990
02:30:57.170 --> 02:30:59.330
<v Speaker 1>what was I talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>September 11th,</v>

2991
02:31:00.620 --> 02:31:01.330
<v Speaker 1>the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2992
02:31:01.330 --> 02:31:02.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>

2993
02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:03.313
<v Speaker 1>So here's something I calculated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said if I was in a seven 67 and we're </v>

2994
02:31:06.051 --> 02:31:11.051
<v Speaker 1>about to crash into a building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was in the last row of the plane,</v>

2995
02:31:13.430 --> 02:31:18.430
<v Speaker 1>how much time would elapse before the </v>
<v Speaker 1>front row crumbled</v>

2996
02:31:21.780 --> 02:31:23.160
<v Speaker 2>and it met me in the back row</v>

2997
02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:27.460
<v Speaker 2>given the speed of the plane going into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the building.</v>

2998
02:31:27.910 --> 02:31:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Five hundred miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2999
02:31:29.720 --> 02:31:31.180
<v Speaker 2>that's probably slower than that by </v>
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

3000
02:31:31.181 --> 02:31:32.014
<v Speaker 2>I would say closer to 400.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a known speed and I don't </v>

3001
02:31:34.511 --> 02:31:35.344
<v Speaker 2>know it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it was is because you </v>

3002
02:31:36.041 --> 02:31:40.140
<v Speaker 2>can't turn at that highest speed and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to like turn around and an ame,</v>

3003
02:31:40.360 --> 02:31:44.200
<v Speaker 2>I have to say it's about a second less </v>
<v Speaker 2>half a fraction of a second.</v>

3004
02:31:44.810 --> 02:31:46.810
<v Speaker 2>It's a fraction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question is tiny,</v>

3005
02:31:46.890 --> 02:31:47.723
<v Speaker 2>how long does it take a plane to go its </v>
<v Speaker 2>own length when it's going at 400 miles </v>

3006
02:31:52.091 --> 02:31:53.570
<v Speaker 2>an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

3007
02:31:53.590 --> 02:31:54.080
<v Speaker 2>Second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3008
02:31:54.080 --> 02:31:56.200
<v Speaker 2>It's a fraction of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like that's it.</v>

3009
02:31:56.230 --> 02:31:57.063
<v Speaker 2>You can't even process that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I figured the deaths were pretty </v>

3010
02:32:00.371 --> 02:32:01.270
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3011
02:32:01.970 --> 02:32:03.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically instantaneous.</v>

3012
02:32:03.400 --> 02:32:05.560
<v Speaker 2>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are pulverized.</v>

3013
02:32:06.530 --> 02:32:11.530
<v Speaker 2>A pile of goo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're planning on making space</v>

3014
02:32:11.701 --> 02:32:13.870
<v Speaker 2>ships that can shoot down another space.</v>

3015
02:32:13.870 --> 02:32:15.340
<v Speaker 2>Ships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here.</v>

3016
02:32:15.341 --> 02:32:17.860
<v Speaker 2>So any space wars would not be war </v>
<v Speaker 2>between space and earth.</v>

3017
02:32:17.890 --> 02:32:22.090
<v Speaker 2>It would be between stuff in space that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all stuff in space,</v>

3018
02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:23.170
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>

3019
02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:24.990
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>space to space.</v>

3020
02:32:25.900 --> 02:32:26.733
<v Speaker 2>Here's another question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you gonna do with all that </v>

3021
02:32:27.791 --> 02:32:29.440
<v Speaker 2>stuff that's just floating around up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there?</v>

3022
02:32:29.860 --> 02:32:30.693
<v Speaker 2>The debris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>HoW about another task of a space for </v>

3023
02:32:32.721 --> 02:32:33.554
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why don't you clean up space for it </v>

3024
02:32:34.420 --> 02:32:35.253
<v Speaker 2>so that we can have tourism and not risk</v>
<v Speaker 2>our lives by a paint chip or going </v>

3025
02:32:39.850 --> 02:32:44.850
<v Speaker 2>18,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>or bolt or a nut moving at 18,000</v>

3026
02:32:45.911 --> 02:32:47.710
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll put a hole straight through you.</v>

3027
02:32:48.150 --> 02:32:50.410
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3028
02:32:50.411 --> 02:32:52.870
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see the portfolio of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>space force,</v>

3029
02:32:52.930 --> 02:32:53.763
<v Speaker 2>if there is a space for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broadened the scope of that to include </v>

3030
02:32:57.820 --> 02:32:58.653
<v Speaker 2>protecting us from asteroids and </v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out a way to clean up the </v>

3031
02:33:01.781 --> 02:33:04.000
<v Speaker 2>debris of space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a concept in place?</v>

3032
02:33:05.820 --> 02:33:06.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3033
02:33:07.190 --> 02:33:08.300
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

3034
02:33:08.301 --> 02:33:11.300
<v Speaker 2>when you look at that map,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know the map is not the scale,</v>

3035
02:33:11.301 --> 02:33:14.030
<v Speaker 2>but it shows you the known satellites in</v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

3036
02:33:14.330 --> 02:33:15.163
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well There it's to scale in the sense </v>

3037
02:33:16.491 --> 02:33:18.590
<v Speaker 2>that they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that many,</v>

3038
02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:22.330
<v Speaker 2>many options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does this relative distance too,</v>

3039
02:33:22.570 --> 02:33:23.403
<v Speaker 2>but they have a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see their orbital line so it </v>

3040
02:33:24.891 --> 02:33:27.800
<v Speaker 2>feels crowded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so crazy when you look at it,</v>

3041
02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:28.663
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's just littered and we're </v>

3042
02:33:30.921 --> 02:33:33.230
<v Speaker 2>continuing to launch new things up there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I joke,</v>

3043
02:33:33.231 --> 02:33:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I say one of the reasons why we've never</v>
<v Speaker 2>been visited by aliens.</v>

3044
02:33:36.590 --> 02:33:39.530
<v Speaker 2>It's because they came to her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is all that junk?</v>

3045
02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:40.393
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh crap.</v>

3046
02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:42.800
<v Speaker 2>We're not risking our love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go to another planet.</v>

3047
02:33:43.220 --> 02:33:46.040
<v Speaker 2>They didn't know the map of where </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was and they had to calculate</v>

3048
02:33:46.041 --> 02:33:47.150
<v Speaker 2>their income.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget it.</v>

3049
02:33:47.180 --> 02:33:48.650
<v Speaker 2>They'll just take it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not worth it.</v>

3050
02:33:48.670 --> 02:33:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3051
02:33:49.430 --> 02:33:50.263
<v Speaker 2>when you're on your way in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to think about it going around </v>

3052
02:33:52.110 --> 02:33:56.060
<v Speaker 2>and visiting another planet that had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization and they left a lot of crap</v>

3053
02:33:56.061 --> 02:33:56.990
<v Speaker 2>in their atmosphere.</v>

3054
02:33:59.580 --> 02:34:00.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

3055
02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:01.280
<v Speaker 2>that's not the debris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>

3056
02:34:01.281 --> 02:34:03.080
<v Speaker 2>Those are the satellites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3057
02:34:03.430 --> 02:34:05.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you thought that is debris.</v>

3058
02:34:05.660 --> 02:34:06.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got it.</v>

3059
02:34:06.290 --> 02:34:07.790
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>

3060
02:34:07.791 --> 02:34:09.800
<v Speaker 2>the air force tracks debris as does </v>
<v Speaker 2>nasa.</v>

3061
02:34:10.490 --> 02:34:15.490
<v Speaker 2>They both tracked debris and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>launch windows of a spacecraft.</v>

3062
02:34:15.860 --> 02:34:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Pieces of shit that's floating around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

3063
02:34:20.261 --> 02:34:22.840
<v Speaker 2>You scrolling through all that fast as I</v>
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>

3064
02:34:24.180 --> 02:34:28.690
<v Speaker 2>That is so nuts were so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've only been doing this for 60 years.</v>

3065
02:34:28.850 --> 02:34:32.230
<v Speaker 2>So you track it right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the last first satellite for,</v>

3066
02:34:32.250 --> 02:34:33.730
<v Speaker 2>for shallow sputnik.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me?</v>

3067
02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:37.770
<v Speaker 2>What year was too far away from you slap</v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

3068
02:34:37.890 --> 02:34:38.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

3069
02:34:40.170 --> 02:34:41.740
<v Speaker 2>Was it sputnik?</v>
<v Speaker 2>October fourth,</v>

3070
02:34:41.741 --> 02:34:43.240
<v Speaker 2>1957.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fifty seven.</v>

3071
02:34:44.230 --> 02:34:46.750
<v Speaker 2>The first artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything in orbit around the earth.</v>

3072
02:34:46.810 --> 02:34:48.480
<v Speaker 2>And on that day too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still up there.</v>

3073
02:34:48.481 --> 02:34:51.790
<v Speaker 2>There was only one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing only then only.</v>

3074
02:34:51.940 --> 02:34:55.000
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From 57 to 2018.</v>

3075
02:34:55.370 --> 02:34:56.890
<v Speaker 2>So at 60 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3076
02:34:57.100 --> 02:35:00.250
<v Speaker 2>One thing that's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now how many things?</v>

3077
02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:03.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's getting the countless debris.</v>

3078
02:35:03.291 --> 02:35:04.124
<v Speaker 2>There's hundreds of active satellites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's thousands if you include the </v>

3079
02:35:06.731 --> 02:35:07.564
<v Speaker 2>dead ones and thousands of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have no way to clean it up or </v>

3080
02:35:12.030 --> 02:35:14.110
<v Speaker 2>maybe some big vacuum one day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3081
02:35:14.170 --> 02:35:16.240
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>space vacuum.</v>

3082
02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:18.393
<v Speaker 2>They'd have to be valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could probably sell space debrIs if </v>

3083
02:35:21.791 --> 02:35:23.320
<v Speaker 2>you brought it back to earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3084
02:35:23.321 --> 02:35:24.550
<v Speaker 2>People are dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd buy it.</v>

3085
02:35:26.090 --> 02:35:27.700
<v Speaker 2>wants the space to put your house on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hill.</v>

3086
02:35:27.701 --> 02:35:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't put this over here.</v>

3087
02:35:30.071 --> 02:35:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of debris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking of debris,</v>

3088
02:35:32.630 --> 02:35:33.463
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this asteroid that collided </v>

3089
02:35:35.771 --> 02:35:37.180
<v Speaker 2>with earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3090
02:35:37.290 --> 02:35:41.740
<v Speaker 2>over a chai being in the soviet union in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>

3091
02:35:41.741 --> 02:35:44.290
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just near the siberia.</v>

3092
02:35:44.770 --> 02:35:48.430
<v Speaker 2>In the ural mountains just on the coast </v>
<v Speaker 2>of siberia than the border of siberia.</v>

3093
02:35:49.120 --> 02:35:53.080
<v Speaker 2>That was visible to everybody in broad </v>
<v Speaker 2>daylight.</v>

3094
02:35:53.110 --> 02:35:53.943
<v Speaker 2>And you had to avert your eyes when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and they felt a shock wave and </v>

3095
02:35:56.591 --> 02:36:00.580
<v Speaker 2>the shockwave broke windows and sent 600</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3096
02:36:00.760 --> 02:36:02.230
<v Speaker 2>Nearly a thousand people to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospital.</v>

3097
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:04.780
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3098
02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:07.310
<v Speaker 2>because they saw the light and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>came.</v>

3099
02:36:07.350 --> 02:36:10.540
<v Speaker 2>They got up from their table and went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the window to see what had happened.</v>

3100
02:36:11.620 --> 02:36:12.453
<v Speaker 2>There's a time delay between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shockwave and the light because light </v>

3101
02:36:15.941 --> 02:36:16.774
<v Speaker 2>travels fast and sound travels slow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll go to the windows in the shock </v>

3102
02:36:19.871 --> 02:36:22.720
<v Speaker 2>wave hits and it blasts broken glass </v>
<v Speaker 2>into their face,</v>

3103
02:36:23.170 --> 02:36:24.003
<v Speaker 2>so it's a big bandaid collision that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had people all needed basically </v>

3104
02:36:29.291 --> 02:36:30.101
<v Speaker 2>bandaids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3105
02:36:30.101 --> 02:36:30.934
<v Speaker 2>No one died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nearly a thousand people were </v>

3106
02:36:32.771 --> 02:36:35.320
<v Speaker 2>injured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so at an auction,</v>

3107
02:36:36.220 --> 02:36:41.220
<v Speaker 2>but that actually exploded and pieces of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it were recovered at an auction.</v>

3108
02:36:41.681 --> 02:36:43.810
<v Speaker 2>I purchased a piece of that media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3109
02:36:43.990 --> 02:36:44.823
<v Speaker 2>but you're also purchased some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shards of glass that the shock wave had </v>

3110
02:36:49.931 --> 02:36:50.764
<v Speaker 2>broken.</v>

3111
02:36:51.310 --> 02:36:52.750
<v Speaker 2>What do you do with this shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got it.</v>

3112
02:36:52.780 --> 02:36:54.020
<v Speaker 2>It's just a habit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a.</v>

3113
02:36:54.040 --> 02:36:57.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a shot across our bow.</v>

3114
02:36:58.420 --> 02:37:01.510
<v Speaker 2>That's what that one died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a warning.</v>

3115
02:37:01.540 --> 02:37:02.373
<v Speaker 2>There's no better way to be warned then </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a bandaid cover your injuries </v>

3116
02:37:06.971 --> 02:37:10.930
<v Speaker 2>that could have vaporized you or </v>
<v Speaker 2>rendered your species extinct.</v>

3117
02:37:11.110 --> 02:37:11.943
<v Speaker 2>What's crazy is the ones that don't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>make impact and still do devastating </v>

3118
02:37:14.381 --> 02:37:15.214
<v Speaker 2>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3119
02:37:15.570 --> 02:37:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That didn't,</v>

3120
02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:18.160
<v Speaker 2>that one didn't touch earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3121
02:37:18.470 --> 02:37:19.940
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It incinerated 10,000</v>

3122
02:37:19.941 --> 02:37:22.430
<v Speaker 2>square kilometers of forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll get that honk.</v>

3123
02:37:22.700 --> 02:37:24.440
<v Speaker 2>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3124
02:37:24.441 --> 02:37:26.360
<v Speaker 2>So February 15th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2013.</v>

3125
02:37:26.361 --> 02:37:29.260
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a haze over a half.</v>

3126
02:37:29.261 --> 02:37:31.910
<v Speaker 2>A ton of little rock was a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>

3127
02:37:32.010 --> 02:37:32.843
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a piece that made it </v>

3128
02:37:34.311 --> 02:37:35.144
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it iron or the actual piece would </v>

3129
02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:41.990
<v Speaker 2>have been a about the size of this room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a small home.</v>

3130
02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:43.070
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3131
02:37:43.080 --> 02:37:44.300
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's amazing that,</v>

3132
02:37:44.301 --> 02:37:46.220
<v Speaker 2>that small rug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go back up to that again.</v>

3133
02:37:46.221 --> 02:37:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Please look at the size of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not that.</v>

3134
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.591
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3135
02:37:48.591 --> 02:37:52.910
<v Speaker 2>That's what's left over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of it is a vaporized on that,</v>

3136
02:37:52.970 --> 02:37:54.880
<v Speaker 2>on the explosion as it came through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere.</v>

3137
02:37:54.881 --> 02:37:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they're saying that that piece of it</v>

3138
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:57.703
<v Speaker 2>weighs a thousand pounds a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they give it the weight of it over a </v>

3139
02:38:02.001 --> 02:38:03.030
<v Speaker 2>half ton?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3140
02:38:03.230 --> 02:38:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to.</v>

3141
02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:04.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thousand pounds.</v>

3142
02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:07.760
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that rock is that fucking have.</v>

3143
02:38:07.770 --> 02:38:08.540
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3144
02:38:08.540 --> 02:38:09.373
<v Speaker 2>so yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I have to read that to know for </v>

3145
02:38:12.531 --> 02:38:14.360
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it was an iron meteorite.</v>

3146
02:38:14.450 --> 02:38:15.283
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a knife that was made out of a </v>

3147
02:38:18.471 --> 02:38:20.390
<v Speaker 2>piece of media or as do I though the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful.</v>

3148
02:38:20.420 --> 02:38:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a kitchen knife that I use.</v>

3149
02:38:22.490 --> 02:38:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see how mine is like a.</v>

3150
02:38:24.020 --> 02:38:28.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like a crocodile dundee knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not a knife.</v>

3151
02:38:28.300 --> 02:38:30.950
<v Speaker 2>That's a knife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's waiting.</v>

3152
02:38:30.970 --> 02:38:33.770
<v Speaker 2>I want to make a or get someone to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>a handle for it.</v>

3153
02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:34.633
<v Speaker 2>It's just the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a metal that would be within </v>

3154
02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:40.610
<v Speaker 2>kitchens for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a forged metal with the blade,</v>

3155
02:38:40.970 --> 02:38:43.790
<v Speaker 2>but then you get a pearl handle attached</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the base of.</v>

3156
02:38:43.791 --> 02:38:44.624
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's going to handle this an it's an </v>

3157
02:38:48.021 --> 02:38:53.021
<v Speaker 2>unadorned piece of metal that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a know the knife sharpening.</v>

3158
02:38:56.930 --> 02:38:58.340
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's the fucking handle?</v>

3159
02:38:59.300 --> 02:39:02.270
<v Speaker 2>there is a metal hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen a kitchen?</v>

3160
02:39:02.271 --> 02:39:03.104
<v Speaker 2>Knives?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The metal goes all the way down in down </v>

3161
02:39:05.090 --> 02:39:08.360
<v Speaker 2>the center of the handle and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>screw wooden handles on the side.</v>

3162
02:39:08.361 --> 02:39:09.194
<v Speaker 2>So you just need the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just need the wood or the or the </v>

3163
02:39:11.590 --> 02:39:13.070
<v Speaker 2>patent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be pearl,</v>

3164
02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:15.110
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3165
02:39:15.530 --> 02:39:18.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got handed revolver,</v>

3166
02:39:18.820 --> 02:39:19.653
<v Speaker 2>pearl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pistol,</v>

3167
02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:21.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

3168
02:39:21.480 --> 02:39:22.313
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a part of history and it's a </v>

3169
02:39:24.291 --> 02:39:29.291
<v Speaker 2>reminder that if you want to think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future of civilization,</v>

3170
02:39:29.330 --> 02:39:32.410
<v Speaker 2>you have to include a defense plan </v>
<v Speaker 2>against asteroids,</v>

3171
02:39:33.140 --> 02:39:34.640
<v Speaker 2>the dinosaurs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dinosaurs.</v>

3172
02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:36.073
<v Speaker 2>I bet if they could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have had a space program to </v>

3173
02:39:39.411 --> 02:39:41.000
<v Speaker 2>not go extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No shit.</v>

3174
02:39:42.420 --> 02:39:43.253
<v Speaker 2>Thinking now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there anything that we're doing now </v>

3175
02:39:48.500 --> 02:39:50.810
<v Speaker 2>other than occasionally looking up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3176
02:39:50.811 --> 02:39:53.480
<v Speaker 2>We're looking with monitoring and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cataloging them.</v>

3177
02:39:53.750 --> 02:39:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't really know what to do.</v>

3178
02:39:55.140 --> 02:39:56.630
<v Speaker 2>if it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day would come,</v>

3179
02:39:56.660 --> 02:39:57.411
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know what to do.</v>

3180
02:39:57.411 --> 02:39:59.480
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing funded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have their engineering conferences.</v>

3181
02:39:59.481 --> 02:40:03.690
<v Speaker 2>How would you deflect an asteroid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you destroy us to see one in a</v>

3182
02:40:04.260 --> 02:40:08.240
<v Speaker 2>one way and commit 100 percent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just kiss your ass goodbye.</v>

3183
02:40:08.350 --> 02:40:09.290
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would.</v>

3184
02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:10.193
<v Speaker 2>We would have the power to tell you when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would die and what part of earthy </v>

3185
02:40:12.260 --> 02:40:12.840
<v Speaker 2>would hit.</v>

3186
02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:13.673
<v Speaker 2>So there's people that have very </v>
<v Speaker 2>delusional ideas about what we can and </v>

3187
02:40:16.081 --> 02:40:18.030
<v Speaker 2>can't do with asteroids and that drives </v>
<v Speaker 2>me crazy.</v>

3188
02:40:18.460 --> 02:40:19.293
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that we know how to defeat the </v>

3189
02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:22.320
<v Speaker 2>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The engineering plans,</v>

3190
02:40:22.321 --> 02:40:23.850
<v Speaker 2>they look very good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing in place,</v>

3191
02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:25.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's project sentinel you can</v>

3192
02:40:25.921 --> 02:40:27.180
<v Speaker 2>look it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

3193
02:40:27.270 --> 02:40:28.103
<v Speaker 2>has tasked themselves with organizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>world governments to protect earth from </v>

3194
02:40:31.801 --> 02:40:32.634
<v Speaker 2>species killing asteroids and you need </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world because you don't know in </v>

3195
02:40:35.821 --> 02:40:36.654
<v Speaker 2>advance until it's discovered what part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of earth it's going to hit and if it's </v>

3196
02:40:39.691 --> 02:40:43.650
<v Speaker 2>going to hit in the indian ocean and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>indian,</v>

3197
02:40:43.710 --> 02:40:44.760
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

3198
02:40:44.810 --> 02:40:45.643
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the surrounding regions don't have a </v>

3199
02:40:47.551 --> 02:40:48.384
<v Speaker 2>space program or are there countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>that do have a space program going to </v>

3200
02:40:51.661 --> 02:40:52.494
<v Speaker 2>sit idle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know what you want to do iS you want to </v>

3201
02:40:54.661 --> 02:40:59.661
<v Speaker 2>have a fund and every country pipes in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of their gdp and then or,</v>

3202
02:41:00.300 --> 02:41:02.020
<v Speaker 2>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3203
02:41:03.270 --> 02:41:04.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you measure it however you want.</v>

3204
02:41:04.890 --> 02:41:06.810
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you think is fair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it the way,</v>

3205
02:41:07.090 --> 02:41:08.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

3206
02:41:09.190 --> 02:41:10.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the un does it.</v>

3207
02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:13.440
<v Speaker 2>OkaY.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's attacks of the world relative</v>

3208
02:41:13.441 --> 02:41:14.274
<v Speaker 2>to your wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that money pays to save the </v>

3209
02:41:16.111 --> 02:41:16.944
<v Speaker 2>world when we find such an asteroid that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how you at the sentinel project </v>

3210
02:41:20.281 --> 02:41:22.230
<v Speaker 2>sentinel is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

3211
02:41:22.310 --> 02:41:23.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has thought this through.</v>

3212
02:41:23.850 --> 02:41:27.300
<v Speaker 2>So if they're engineers and scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ample time,</v>

3213
02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:28.433
<v Speaker 2>there's possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a possibility that they could </v>

3214
02:41:30.061 --> 02:41:32.700
<v Speaker 2>actually implement some of these plans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all about how much time you have,</v>

3215
02:41:32.730 --> 02:41:35.840
<v Speaker 2>because what you want to do is go out </v>
<v Speaker 2>and nudge it a little bit,</v>

3216
02:41:36.240 --> 02:41:37.073
<v Speaker 2>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just have to give it a sideways </v>

3217
02:41:39.210 --> 02:41:42.420
<v Speaker 2>velocity relative to its path towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

3218
02:41:42.490 --> 02:41:43.323
<v Speaker 2>If you do that early enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sideways velocity sort of </v>

3219
02:41:47.160 --> 02:41:52.110
<v Speaker 2>accumulates like a ship turning slightly</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the ocean of the course of time.</v>

3220
02:41:52.111 --> 02:41:53.580
<v Speaker 2>It'll deviate quite a bit.</v>

3221
02:41:53.610 --> 02:41:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that angle grows.</v>

3222
02:41:56.440 --> 02:41:58.410
<v Speaker 2>It's the same angle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it spreads out.</v>

3223
02:41:58.610 --> 02:42:01.770
<v Speaker 2>And if the ocean example is perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a perfect analogy.</v>

3224
02:42:01.920 --> 02:42:05.040
<v Speaker 2>So if you do that early enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it enough so that it misses earth</v>

3225
02:42:05.070 --> 02:42:07.290
<v Speaker 2>and it's still out there to harm you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>another day,</v>

3226
02:42:07.291 --> 02:42:09.570
<v Speaker 2>but it won't render you extinct on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>passage.</v>

3227
02:42:09.870 --> 02:42:13.530
<v Speaker 2>How much time do we need today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3228
02:42:13.531 --> 02:42:17.910
<v Speaker 2>if I would say we could probably get </v>
<v Speaker 2>something built in 10 years.</v>

3229
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:23.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh geez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm looking for a month.</v>

3230
02:42:24.920 --> 02:42:26.130
<v Speaker 2>And that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh no.</v>

3231
02:42:26.131 --> 02:42:27.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a year.</v>

3232
02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:28.793
<v Speaker 2>If we have a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the good thing about species killing </v>

3233
02:42:30.541 --> 02:42:33.840
<v Speaker 2>asteroids is that they're large and </v>
<v Speaker 2>visible.</v>

3234
02:42:34.390 --> 02:42:37.040
<v Speaker 2>WhAt about city killing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ones them slip through.</v>

3235
02:42:37.130 --> 02:42:41.040
<v Speaker 2>They'll slip through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of earth's surfaces,</v>

3236
02:42:41.041 --> 02:42:45.170
<v Speaker 2>not city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it'll probably hit the ocean or land,</v>

3237
02:42:45.180 --> 02:42:46.050
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it does,</v>

3238
02:42:46.051 --> 02:42:46.890
<v Speaker 2>it would take out a city.</v>

3239
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:49.340
<v Speaker 2>The whole city gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3240
02:42:50.150 --> 02:42:53.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a branch of government part of,</v>

3241
02:42:53.310 --> 02:42:55.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it survived the trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>changeover,</v>

3242
02:42:55.410 --> 02:42:56.243
<v Speaker 2>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's part of a homeland security were </v>

3243
02:43:00.030 --> 02:43:05.030
<v Speaker 2>worries about devastation to a region </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the grid is taken out as well.</v>

3244
02:43:07.980 --> 02:43:12.040
<v Speaker 2>So you can't bring emergency services </v>
<v Speaker 2>that bring either food,</v>

3245
02:43:12.041 --> 02:43:13.990
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medicines,</v>

3246
02:43:14.460 --> 02:43:15.293
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any other form of transportation or </v>

3247
02:43:16.391 --> 02:43:17.224
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much thought is there to putting in </v>

3248
02:43:18.881 --> 02:43:22.060
<v Speaker 2>a more robust grid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3249
02:43:22.370 --> 02:43:24.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3250
02:43:24.221 --> 02:43:26.230
<v Speaker 2>what you would need is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>

3251
02:43:26.380 --> 02:43:27.213
<v Speaker 2>So you need a grid that can sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rewire itself rapidly to then bring </v>

3252
02:43:33.011 --> 02:43:36.430
<v Speaker 2>power to a region that's what you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>

3253
02:43:36.460 --> 02:43:39.550
<v Speaker 2>And it would ditch sorta doing that now </v>
<v Speaker 2>making a grid,</v>

3254
02:43:39.610 --> 02:43:43.010
<v Speaker 2>sort of a lightening proof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3255
02:43:43.140 --> 02:43:43.973
<v Speaker 2>a power surge proof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in New York city where there </v>

3256
02:43:47.081 --> 02:43:50.380
<v Speaker 2>were a couple of very famous blackouts </v>
<v Speaker 2>when in 1966 and other in.</v>

3257
02:43:50.530 --> 02:43:52.630
<v Speaker 2>When was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 78 I think.</v>

3258
02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:55.450
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

3259
02:43:55.451 --> 02:43:57.730
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how should this,</v>

3260
02:43:57.760 --> 02:44:01.390
<v Speaker 2>how is this even allowed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a backup plan.</v>

3261
02:44:01.450 --> 02:44:02.283
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a way to rewire this to </v>

3262
02:44:03.281 --> 02:44:07.210
<v Speaker 2>redirect the electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3263
02:44:07.570 --> 02:44:08.403
<v Speaker 2>you'd need that and you'd want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought the new grid is supposed </v>

3264
02:44:11.381 --> 02:44:13.210
<v Speaker 2>to have those kinds of protections built</v>
<v Speaker 2>into it,</v>

3265
02:44:13.330 --> 02:44:14.980
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know enough about it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>comment.</v>

3266
02:44:16.980 --> 02:44:19.570
<v Speaker 2>It is one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one impact.</v>

3267
02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:23.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One big one takes out the grid.</v>

3268
02:44:23.170 --> 02:44:26.020
<v Speaker 2>It takes out the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what do you have?</v>

3269
02:44:26.021 --> 02:44:27.870
<v Speaker 2>Solar power you place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3270
02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:30.940
<v Speaker 2>we just put in solar panels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3271
02:44:31.610 --> 02:44:35.260
<v Speaker 2>You live in a place that's obviously we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a place in the country escape to.</v>

3272
02:44:35.350 --> 02:44:36.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good move to have that escape </v>

3273
02:44:37.241 --> 02:44:38.074
<v Speaker 2>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3274
02:44:38.110 --> 02:44:41.050
<v Speaker 2>You have a place in upstate New York on </v>
<v Speaker 2>long island?</v>

3275
02:44:41.080 --> 02:44:41.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to think of it as an escape </v>

3276
02:44:42.821 --> 02:44:46.170
<v Speaker 2>because we thought of getting after </v>
<v Speaker 2>September 11th.</v>

3277
02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:47.141
<v Speaker 2>Got it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3278
02:44:47.141 --> 02:44:48.460
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3279
02:44:48.461 --> 02:44:49.330
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

3280
02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:54.700
<v Speaker 2>but now it's just a good place for me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>refuel and through a lot of good writing</v>

3281
02:44:54.701 --> 02:44:57.150
<v Speaker 2>there and this sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look out for ticks and oh,</v>

3282
02:44:57.210 --> 02:44:58.043
<v Speaker 2>oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Long island's overwhelmed with lyme </v>

3283
02:44:59.591 --> 02:45:00.424
<v Speaker 2>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got a new tick apparently that </v>

3284
02:45:01.660 --> 02:45:04.540
<v Speaker 2>prevents you from eating meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarians,</v>

3285
02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:05.433
<v Speaker 2>bread that think it's called the lone </v>
<v Speaker 2>star tick and it prevents you from </v>

3286
02:45:11.471 --> 02:45:14.020
<v Speaker 2>eating the meat of mammals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3287
02:45:14.090 --> 02:45:17.200
<v Speaker 2>If it makes you allergic to alpha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>galactose,</v>

3288
02:45:17.201 --> 02:45:18.970
<v Speaker 2>is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's alpha gao.</v>

3289
02:45:19.100 --> 02:45:21.550
<v Speaker 2>Another great radio podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3290
02:45:21.570 --> 02:45:24.700
<v Speaker 2>I detail I think the vegans and </v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetarians,</v>

3291
02:45:24.701 --> 02:45:25.870
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3292
02:45:25.871 --> 02:45:28.490
<v Speaker 2>I think they still eat fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3293
02:45:28.990 --> 02:45:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Chicken eater mammal can't eat red meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something in red meat.</v>

3294
02:45:32.950 --> 02:45:33.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3295
02:45:33.731 --> 02:45:36.530
<v Speaker 2>So that's one of the challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3296
02:45:36.720 --> 02:45:39.460
<v Speaker 2>But damn ticks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are everywhere.</v>

3297
02:45:39.790 --> 02:45:41.770
<v Speaker 2>And we looked at it the other day.</v>

3298
02:45:41.770 --> 02:45:42.603
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I have quite a few friends that </v>

3299
02:45:43.721 --> 02:45:45.760
<v Speaker 2>have lyme disease and it's something you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do keep for life.</v>

3300
02:45:46.330 --> 02:45:48.490
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a few friends,</v>

3301
02:45:48.730 --> 02:45:52.840
<v Speaker 2>like seven or eight and I think at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point that have devastating lyme disease</v>

3302
02:45:52.841 --> 02:45:55.780
<v Speaker 2>and it's all east coast people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were making love in the brush,</v>

3303
02:45:55.810 --> 02:45:57.220
<v Speaker 2>like what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walking around,</v>

3304
02:45:57.250 --> 02:45:58.450
<v Speaker 2>going for a hike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3305
02:45:59.100 --> 02:46:01.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm a city person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so even though I moved to the country,</v>

3306
02:46:01.860 --> 02:46:05.260
<v Speaker 2>I go for a hike on my deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't go anywhere.</v>

3307
02:46:05.330 --> 02:46:05.981
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3308
02:46:05.981 --> 02:46:09.180
<v Speaker 2>Sit back just a little on the deck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pay,</v>

3309
02:46:09.540 --> 02:46:12.290
<v Speaker 2>but you're out there in the gorgeous </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

3310
02:46:12.291 --> 02:46:14.000
<v Speaker 2>don't you want to go wander around a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit?</v>

3311
02:46:14.430 --> 02:46:18.050
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's honestly not a thought.</v>

3312
02:46:18.180 --> 02:46:20.360
<v Speaker 2>My wife was from Alaska has those </v>
<v Speaker 2>thoughts all the time,</v>

3313
02:46:20.840 --> 02:46:23.900
<v Speaker 2>but the power of ticks overwhelms her </v>
<v Speaker 2>power of curiosity.</v>

3314
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:25.640
<v Speaker 2>Those are powerful people in Alaska.</v>

3315
02:46:25.640 --> 02:46:27.500
<v Speaker 2>That's a different type of their.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their,</v>

3316
02:46:27.550 --> 02:46:29.150
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their bread differently.</v>

3317
02:46:29.151 --> 02:46:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're strong.</v>

3318
02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:31.513
<v Speaker 2>Those people can survive and then they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a sentence to say unity up </v>

3319
02:46:34.701 --> 02:46:35.534
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting that unity I </v>

3320
02:46:36.711 --> 02:46:41.690
<v Speaker 2>think comes from the fact that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>all in the same risk factors together.</v>

3321
02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>

3322
02:46:43.460 --> 02:46:44.293
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you and I have the same things that </v>

3323
02:46:45.141 --> 02:46:46.760
<v Speaker 2>can kill us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes us friends.</v>

3324
02:46:47.150 --> 02:46:47.983
<v Speaker 2>It's also they're overwhelmed by nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're overwhelmed by both </v>

3325
02:46:51.170 --> 02:46:55.820
<v Speaker 2>its beauty and just the sheer evidence </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you're insignificant.</v>

3326
02:46:55.821 --> 02:46:58.110
<v Speaker 2>I would say they're not overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are wellmed,</v>

3327
02:46:58.560 --> 02:46:59.393
<v Speaker 2>but who's the right amount of wealth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a buddy of mine who lived up </v>

3328
02:47:03.201 --> 02:47:04.034
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A grizzly bear killed a moose in his </v>

3329
02:47:04.941 --> 02:47:08.420
<v Speaker 2>driveway who like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3330
02:47:08.600 --> 02:47:10.430
<v Speaker 2>That's the kind of stuff in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>driveway.</v>

3331
02:47:10.460 --> 02:47:14.100
<v Speaker 2>They had to be careful like getting out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the house because the bear had cashed</v>

3332
02:47:14.101 --> 02:47:15.590
<v Speaker 2>the moose when we first went up there.</v>

3333
02:47:15.590 --> 02:47:20.590
<v Speaker 2>My brother in law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my wife's sister's husband kept a loaded</v>

3334
02:47:21.381 --> 02:47:22.214
<v Speaker 2>shotgun over their bed so that when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>door starts rattling in the middle of </v>

3335
02:47:26.901 --> 02:47:27.734
<v Speaker 2>the night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gun is in his arms reach and that </v>

3336
02:47:34.941 --> 02:47:35.930
<v Speaker 2>was good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was good.</v>

3337
02:47:35.990 --> 02:47:37.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those fucking things.</v>

3338
02:47:37.870 --> 02:47:39.720
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen one in real life?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3339
02:47:40.330 --> 02:47:42.430
<v Speaker 2>zoo captive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a real one.</v>

3340
02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:44.820
<v Speaker 2>Real one because there's a look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

3341
02:47:44.830 --> 02:47:45.330
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3342
02:47:45.330 --> 02:47:45.741
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3343
02:47:45.741 --> 02:47:49.220
<v Speaker 2>we've visited denali park,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I saw it's 500 yards away.</v>

3344
02:47:49.280 --> 02:47:52.610
<v Speaker 2>It's not any closer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denali park,</v>

3345
02:47:52.611 --> 02:47:54.860
<v Speaker 2>they're a little bit habitualized to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3346
02:47:54.980 --> 02:47:57.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was pretty wild.</v>

3347
02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>denali park it with jellystone park.</v>

3348
02:48:00.171 --> 02:48:02.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking of something different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think in a jellystone park,</v>

3349
02:48:02.540 --> 02:48:04.160
<v Speaker 2>denali park is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3350
02:48:04.850 --> 02:48:07.130
<v Speaker 2>where we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that near what part of Alaska is</v>

3351
02:48:07.131 --> 02:48:08.630
<v Speaker 2>that near?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got.</v>

3352
02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:10.600
<v Speaker 2>It's got mount mckinley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>denali,</v>

3353
02:48:10.940 --> 02:48:11.990
<v Speaker 2>the mountain in it.</v>

3354
02:48:12.980 --> 02:48:13.521
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3355
02:48:13.521 --> 02:48:14.930
<v Speaker 2>so where is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>

3356
02:48:14.940 --> 02:48:15.800
<v Speaker 2>I forgot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3357
02:48:15.801 --> 02:48:16.634
<v Speaker 2>geographically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not near the brooks range </v>

3358
02:48:19.230 --> 02:48:20.540
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't tell you.</v>

3359
02:48:21.010 --> 02:48:22.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a mountain range.</v>

3360
02:48:22.750 --> 02:48:23.583
<v Speaker 2>The sheer size of Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you actually look at it over the </v>

3361
02:48:26.541 --> 02:48:29.390
<v Speaker 2>United States superimposed at you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3362
02:48:29.820 --> 02:48:30.760
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to know.</v>

3363
02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:34.280
<v Speaker 2>Another one with another one besides of </v>
<v Speaker 2>africa relative to the United States.</v>

3364
02:48:34.281 --> 02:48:35.340
<v Speaker 2>We've done that anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

3365
02:48:35.510 --> 02:48:36.910
<v Speaker 2>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything fits in there.</v>

3366
02:48:36.950 --> 02:48:38.990
<v Speaker 2>Everything fits in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like five.</v>

3367
02:48:38.991 --> 02:48:42.900
<v Speaker 2>United states can literally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything fits in there.</v>

3368
02:48:42.901 --> 02:48:44.990
<v Speaker 2>It looks like most of the world that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>

3369
02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:46.960
<v Speaker 2>United states plus europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asia,</v>

3370
02:48:47.350 --> 02:48:48.180
<v Speaker 2>China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>

3371
02:48:48.180 --> 02:48:48.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3372
02:48:48.890 --> 02:48:50.930
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a giant place.</v>

3373
02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:54.680
<v Speaker 2>But what's really interesting about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alaska is how few people there.</v>

3374
02:48:55.010 --> 02:48:55.720
<v Speaker 2>RighT?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3375
02:48:55.720 --> 02:48:58.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's such a low density </v>
<v Speaker 2>population density,</v>

3376
02:48:58.551 --> 02:48:59.384
<v Speaker 2>so light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3377
02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:01.790
<v Speaker 2>but anchorage is a really cool city.</v>

3378
02:49:01.850 --> 02:49:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Like if you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3379
02:49:02.870 --> 02:49:04.670
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a cool ass town,</v>

3380
02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:06.800
<v Speaker 2>nice people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you go there in the summer,</v>

3381
02:49:07.050 --> 02:49:09.360
<v Speaker 2>bring some things to cover your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3382
02:49:09.570 --> 02:49:12.090
<v Speaker 2>because when you go into bed at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to bed during the day.</v>

3383
02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:12.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3384
02:49:13.220 --> 02:49:14.053
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3385
02:49:15.290 --> 02:49:17.280
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my wife said in the winter when they</v>

3386
02:49:17.281 --> 02:49:19.020
<v Speaker 2>go to school and dark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not nighttime,</v>

3387
02:49:19.021 --> 02:49:21.300
<v Speaker 2>it's dark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't use night and day.</v>

3388
02:49:21.330 --> 02:49:23.070
<v Speaker 2>It's just dark and light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3389
02:49:23.071 --> 02:49:24.600
<v Speaker 2>Because it's the only light for a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

3390
02:49:24.601 --> 02:49:26.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's light then it's dark.</v>

3391
02:49:26.460 --> 02:49:28.260
<v Speaker 2>She ever see that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3392
02:49:28.390 --> 02:49:31.770

<v Speaker 2>Vampire movie about Alaska?</v>

3393
02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:32.930
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3394
02:49:32.940 --> 02:49:35.250
<v Speaker 2>the vampires came to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was actually pretty fun.</v>

3395
02:49:35.251 --> 02:49:37.560
<v Speaker 2>One vampire movie in my landlord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vampire movies,</v>

3396
02:49:38.130 --> 02:49:43.130
<v Speaker 2>I have nothing against them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just don't let smart homes don't,</v>

3397
02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:44.653
<v Speaker 2>can't put that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see the romance of getting </v>

3398
02:49:46.561 --> 02:49:47.394
<v Speaker 2>bitten in the neck.</v>

3399
02:49:47.550 --> 02:49:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to stop romance.</v>

3400
02:49:48.981 --> 02:49:50.710
<v Speaker 2>It's scary actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>

3401
02:49:50.711 --> 02:49:51.420
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

<v Speaker 2>new martial arts and kicked ass wasn't </v>

3426
02:50:54.421 --> 02:50:59.421
<v Speaker 2>believable but whatever was believable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when she's shooting that thing,</v>

3427
02:51:01.291 --> 02:51:02.620
<v Speaker 2>like if you buy like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3428
02:51:02.621 --> 02:51:03.454
<v Speaker 2>she's throwing gasoline on this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This to me is like to you when you're </v>

3429
02:51:08.971 --> 02:51:13.950
<v Speaker 2>making fun of the mistakes that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>make in these movies about space.</v>

3430
02:51:14.070 --> 02:51:14.903
<v Speaker 2>This shit drives me crazy that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>just flip and peoples through the air </v>

3431
02:51:17.941 --> 02:51:21.740
<v Speaker 2>and then they fly off buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

3432
02:51:21.950 --> 02:51:24.600
<v Speaker 2>You're driving me fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like I have a tweet.</v>

3433
02:51:24.670 --> 02:51:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should I post it now?</v>

3434
02:51:27.620 --> 02:51:28.453
<v Speaker 2>Not too long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to take one of those dangerous </v>

3435
02:51:30.061 --> 02:51:31.470
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't put a case on your phone.</v>

3436
02:51:31.560 --> 02:51:36.560
<v Speaker 2>You have the fucking gape in your back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on your phone.</v>

3437
02:51:36.601 --> 02:51:39.750
<v Speaker 2>Your lock screen is the stonehenge of </v>
<v Speaker 2>manhattan.</v>

3438
02:51:42.140 --> 02:51:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan henge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No case on your phone.</v>

3439
02:51:46.030 --> 02:51:47.170
<v Speaker 2>So you're a risk taker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3440
02:51:47.570 --> 02:51:50.550
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can think of it as risk taking or</v>

3441
02:51:50.760 --> 02:51:54.120
<v Speaker 2>when I got the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I admire how thin this is,</v>

3442
02:51:54.150 --> 02:51:58.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like technology serving me.</v>

3443
02:51:59.070 --> 02:52:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I do when I got the phone,</v>

3444
02:52:01.140 --> 02:52:03.690
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me do this with it.</v>

3445
02:52:04.770 --> 02:52:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Flip around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3446
02:52:06.640 --> 02:52:08.890
<v Speaker 2>And I reminded myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do,</v>

3447
02:52:09.260 --> 02:52:10.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3448
02:52:10.270 --> 02:52:11.103
<v Speaker 2>in the military cadets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do they twirl their gun of what </v>

3449
02:52:14.321 --> 02:52:15.154
<v Speaker 2>possible value is this in combat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do they do these things with their </v>

3450
02:52:18.461 --> 02:52:19.294
<v Speaker 2>gun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized you're not supposed </v>

3451
02:52:20.861 --> 02:52:24.730
<v Speaker 2>to drop your gun ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

3452
02:52:25.450 --> 02:52:27.730
<v Speaker 2>So if you twirl the gun and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>drop it,</v>

3453
02:52:27.820 --> 02:52:31.810
<v Speaker 2>it means stuff can happen to you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>combat and it is always attached to your</v>

3454
02:52:31.811 --> 02:52:33.270
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3455
02:52:34.130 --> 02:52:37.750
<v Speaker 2>so when I got my phone I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just do this.</v>

3456
02:52:39.970 --> 02:52:41.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just do this.</v>

3457
02:52:41.921 --> 02:52:46.921
<v Speaker 2>If I pick up the phone and dropped it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus christ.</v>

3458
02:52:47.831 --> 02:52:52.630
<v Speaker 2>So when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you never drop your phone.</v>

3459
02:52:52.900 --> 02:52:53.733
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that I'm a risk taker is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I've changed my risk to make it so </v>

3460
02:52:58.511 --> 02:52:59.344
<v Speaker 2>low that it essentially won't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've got apple care to get apple </v>

3461
02:53:03.871 --> 02:53:05.530
<v Speaker 2>care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you didn't know.</v>

3462
02:53:05.531 --> 02:53:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Of course I'll get applicants know </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a risk taker first.</v>

3463
02:53:07.730 --> 02:53:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I fixed my own damn computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second.</v>

3464
02:53:09.920 --> 02:53:11.500
<v Speaker 2>How are you going to fix your own damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone?</v>

3465
02:53:11.530 --> 02:53:12.363
<v Speaker 2>If the screen breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get in there with a </v>

3466
02:53:14.140 --> 02:53:16.200
<v Speaker 2>screwdriver and pop that bitch out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put the new one,</v>

3467
02:53:16.300 --> 02:53:18.090
<v Speaker 2>the key word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key phrases there.</v>

3468
02:53:18.190 --> 02:53:21.370
<v Speaker 2>If the screen break going to drop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's correct.</v>

3469
02:53:21.710 --> 02:53:24.400
<v Speaker 2>I also carry relatively expensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>fountain pens.</v>

3470
02:53:25.150 --> 02:53:27.400
<v Speaker 2>What happens with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never lose them.</v>

3471
02:53:27.850 --> 02:53:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

3472
02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.080
<v Speaker 2>If you always lose your pens and meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not spending enough money,</v>

3473
02:53:32.110 --> 02:53:33.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like sunglasses.</v>

3474
02:53:33.730 --> 02:53:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Exactly the same pair of sunglasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>NoW,</v>

3475
02:53:35.681 --> 02:53:36.514
<v Speaker 2>for a record number of times the medical</v>
<v Speaker 2>cost you $200 to get a fucking lose </v>

3476
02:53:39.860 --> 02:53:42.460
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just my favorite ones for free.</v>

3477
02:53:42.670 --> 02:53:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Shout out the skeleton sunglasses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3478
02:53:44.591 --> 02:53:46.690
<v Speaker 2>skeleton optics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zeiss lenses,</v>

3479
02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:47.833
<v Speaker 2>zeiss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Powerful fucking invented the </v>

3480
02:53:49.841 --> 02:53:50.674
<v Speaker 2>planetarium projector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did they realize they did make some bad </v>

3481
02:53:52.361 --> 02:53:52.930
<v Speaker 2>ass?</v>
<v Speaker 2>19,</v>

3482
02:53:52.930 --> 02:53:55.870
<v Speaker 2>23,</v>
<v Speaker 2>may 23.</v>

3483
02:53:57.750 --> 02:54:00.130
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm at the same sunglasses now.</v>

3484
02:54:00.131 --> 02:54:01.870
<v Speaker 2>I think you're doing well here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six months.</v>

3485
02:54:02.230 --> 02:54:03.580
<v Speaker 2>He's fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stupid fingers.</v>

3486
02:54:04.020 --> 02:54:06.520
<v Speaker 2>So once you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you get that,</v>

3487
02:54:07.260 --> 02:54:08.093
<v Speaker 2>then it doesn't drop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not that I'm a risk taker is </v>

3488
02:54:09.821 --> 02:54:10.654
<v Speaker 2>I've changed the risk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that is low enough so that it is on </v>

3489
02:54:14.711 --> 02:54:17.380
<v Speaker 2>par or on par with other risks that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>take routinely.</v>

3490
02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:18.580
<v Speaker 2>I smoke a lot of pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

3491
02:54:18.610 --> 02:54:19.420
<v Speaker 2>this is going to drop.</v>

3492
02:54:19.420 --> 02:54:22.710
<v Speaker 2>I keep doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also the things,</v>

3493
02:54:22.810 --> 02:54:25.660
<v Speaker 2>if you pick up the phone with one hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's upside down,</v>

3494
02:54:26.250 --> 02:54:29.890
<v Speaker 2>you hold it in places where the center </v>
<v Speaker 2>of gravity flips it,</v>

3495
02:54:30.310 --> 02:54:32.770
<v Speaker 2>but you also have some sort of a skin in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back.</v>

3496
02:54:33.160 --> 02:54:34.210
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>

3497
02:54:34.211 --> 02:54:36.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a sector of van gogh's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Starry night.</v>

3498
02:54:37.640 --> 02:54:38.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not.</v>

3499
02:54:38.800 --> 02:54:40.900
<v Speaker 2>There's no texture to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a slippery.</v>

3500
02:54:41.860 --> 02:54:44.010
<v Speaker 2>It's slippery like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3501
02:54:44.011 --> 02:54:45.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely more texture.</v>

3502
02:54:47.180 --> 02:54:49.950
<v Speaker 2>Feel that that's slicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's complicated,</v>

3503
02:54:49.951 --> 02:54:50.784
<v Speaker 2>but it's not wise there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my point is that snow white and the </v>

3504
02:54:52.570 --> 02:54:53.403
<v Speaker 2>friction scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should recognize this friction is </v>

3505
02:54:56.111 --> 02:54:56.860
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3506
02:54:56.860 --> 02:54:57.693
<v Speaker 2>I mean isn't that one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they decided to do to asteroids to </v>

3507
02:54:59.560 --> 02:55:00.393
<v Speaker 2>change their path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spray some goo on them and it will </v>

3508
02:55:02.591 --> 02:55:06.590
<v Speaker 2>literally cause more friction in the air</v>
<v Speaker 2>and caused them to deviate slightly from</v>

3509
02:55:06.591 --> 02:55:08.180
<v Speaker 2>their path,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which over a long period of time.</v>

3510
02:55:08.180 --> 02:55:09.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where you just pull that </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of your ass.</v>

3511
02:55:10.060 --> 02:55:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Just that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That moment.</v>

3512
02:55:12.260 --> 02:55:13.093
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read that and maybe it was some </v>

3513
02:55:15.441 --> 02:55:18.080
<v Speaker 2>dummy who wrote it and either vacuum of </v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

3514
02:55:18.140 --> 02:55:18.973
<v Speaker 2>There is no friction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so some shit they could put on the wig </v>

3515
02:55:22.440 --> 02:55:23.273
<v Speaker 2>if it's traveling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't there something they could put on </v>

3516
02:55:25.491 --> 02:55:29.390
<v Speaker 2>that would aerodynamically change its </v>
<v Speaker 2>path in the vacuum of space?</v>

3517
02:55:29.391 --> 02:55:30.980
<v Speaker 2>There is no aerodynamics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3518
02:55:30.981 --> 02:55:33.590
<v Speaker 2>So it's moving by the time it hits her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's atmosphere.</v>

3519
02:55:33.620 --> 02:55:35.000
<v Speaker 2>It's too late.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it ha.</v>

3520
02:55:35.150 --> 02:55:35.983
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a coding that they were </v>

3521
02:55:37.941 --> 02:55:38.774
<v Speaker 2>planning on putting on some aspect of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would it be the act of putting the </v>

3522
02:55:42.411 --> 02:55:43.244
<v Speaker 2>coating on it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you would do is you may be </v>

3523
02:55:44.511 --> 02:55:45.344
<v Speaker 2>thinking of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a coating you can put on an </v>

3524
02:55:45.981 --> 02:55:50.981
<v Speaker 2>asteroid that differently absorbs </v>
<v Speaker 2>sunlight relative to the other side.</v>

3525
02:55:52.090 --> 02:55:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it causes the spin that can,</v>

3526
02:55:54.860 --> 02:55:56.180
<v Speaker 2>that can create a net.</v>

3527
02:55:56.880 --> 02:56:01.880
<v Speaker 2>A vector of motion is spray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any asteroids can protect the earth from</v>

3528
02:56:02.751 --> 02:56:04.120
<v Speaker 2>space rock threat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3529
02:56:04.130 --> 02:56:06.590
<v Speaker 2>so there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like some click baity shit.</v>

3530
02:56:07.890 --> 02:56:10.980
<v Speaker 2>That's some click bait shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3531
02:56:11.330 --> 02:56:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Change the amount of sunlight reflected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you would,</v>

3532
02:56:14.660 --> 02:56:16.340
<v Speaker 2>you would not do that to the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>rock.</v>

3533
02:56:16.370 --> 02:56:19.730
<v Speaker 2>you do it to a part of the rock </v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially nudging and away from earth.</v>

3534
02:56:19.740 --> 02:56:24.620
<v Speaker 2>And the accumulated push provided by </v>
<v Speaker 2>many thermo photons as they radiate from</v>

3535
02:56:24.621 --> 02:56:25.540
<v Speaker 2>the app.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3536
02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:27.770
<v Speaker 2>You asteroid surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy shit.</v>

3537
02:56:27.990 --> 02:56:28.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3538
02:56:29.240 --> 02:56:30.560
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think that through very well.</v>

3539
02:56:30.561 --> 02:56:34.070
<v Speaker 2>And somehow you added a key jelly to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

3540
02:56:39.370 --> 02:56:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to flip this phone still on </v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend andrew santinello.</v>

3541
02:56:44.060 --> 02:56:47.360
<v Speaker 2>He carries this pitch around case free </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I admire him.</v>

3542
02:56:48.230 --> 02:56:52.190
<v Speaker 2>He's braver man than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sent you a list of topics.</v>

3543
02:56:52.191 --> 02:56:53.011
<v Speaker 2>Did we hit all of them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3544
02:56:53.011 --> 02:56:53.844
<v Speaker 2>we hit all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't hit innovation in other </v>

3545
02:56:56.830 --> 02:56:57.650
<v Speaker 2>categories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3546
02:56:57.650 --> 02:56:58.431
<v Speaker 2>Here's one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3547
02:56:58.431 --> 02:57:01.050
<v Speaker 2>we never even got the cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cars.</v>

3548
02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:02.540
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll never be flying cars.</v>

3549
02:57:02.580 --> 02:57:03.141
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3550
02:57:03.141 --> 02:57:03.450
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

3551
02:57:03.450 --> 02:57:05.400
<v Speaker 2>I started with this please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3552
02:57:05.450 --> 02:57:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Since we're two hours and 40 minutes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that allowed?</v>

3553
02:57:09.020 --> 02:57:09.831
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3554
02:57:09.831 --> 02:57:10.664
<v Speaker 2>we're flying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3555
02:57:10.700 --> 02:57:13.340
<v Speaker 2>but people don't have full three hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they?</v>

3556
02:57:13.730 --> 02:57:14.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do it all the time.</v>

3557
02:57:14.870 --> 02:57:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you Sure?</v>

3558
02:57:17.390 --> 02:57:18.650
<v Speaker 2>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3559
02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:20.330
<v Speaker 2>This is not you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3560
02:57:20.331 --> 02:57:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Average podcast right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Average.</v>

3561
02:57:22.250 --> 02:57:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3562
02:57:23.270 --> 02:57:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm honored to bleach your average.</v>

3563
02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:27.313
<v Speaker 2>The ones we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've all been like close to three </v>

3564
02:57:28.761 --> 02:57:29.594
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3565
02:57:29.630 --> 02:57:30.860
<v Speaker 2>Here you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here you go.</v>

3566
02:57:31.110 --> 02:57:32.420
<v Speaker 2>A ding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3567
02:57:32.660 --> 02:57:33.470
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's rude.</v>

3568
02:57:33.470 --> 02:57:34.303
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let me.</v>

3569
02:57:34.370 --> 02:57:36.200
<v Speaker 2>I flipped it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I turned that goddamn switch on.</v>

3570
02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so let's go back to flying cars.</v>

3571
02:57:41.750 --> 02:57:42.583
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to why anyone would want a</v>
<v Speaker 2>flying car in the first place because </v>

3572
02:57:45.621 --> 02:57:46.580
<v Speaker 2>they're an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

3573
02:57:46.670 --> 02:57:48.580
<v Speaker 2>Go here and stuck in traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here at edison,</v>

3574
02:57:48.590 --> 02:57:49.700
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's watch.</v>

3575
02:57:50.450 --> 02:57:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Let's say there was only one road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

3576
02:57:53.150 --> 02:57:53.983
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was the width of your car and </v>

3577
02:57:56.391 --> 02:58:00.110
<v Speaker 2>you're driving on this road and the cars</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind you.</v>

3578
02:58:00.680 --> 02:58:02.100
<v Speaker 2>The you could go</v>

3579
02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:05.340
<v Speaker 1>on that road is the speed of the slowest</v>
<v Speaker 1>car on the road,</v>

3580
02:58:05.560 --> 02:58:06.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

3581
02:58:06.810 --> 02:58:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is travel in one dimension.</v>

3582
02:58:10.230 --> 02:58:11.063
<v Speaker 1>That sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you really want is travel in two </v>

3583
02:58:13.771 --> 02:58:18.120
<v Speaker 1>dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you take the road and why didn't it?</v>

3584
02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Let's make two lanes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two lanes in one direction.</v>

3585
02:58:22.250 --> 02:58:23.730
<v Speaker 1>We can have two of the other way as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

3586
02:58:23.731 --> 02:58:26.050
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't matter here you have two </v>
<v Speaker 1>lanes,</v>

3587
02:58:26.051 --> 02:58:31.051
<v Speaker 1>so now I can go around you your slow ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

3588
02:58:31.950 --> 02:58:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then that's fine.</v>

3589
02:58:35.220 --> 02:58:38.670
<v Speaker 1>This was a great improvement on one </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensional travel.</v>

3590
02:58:39.090 --> 02:58:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Now it's two dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3591
02:58:42.240 --> 02:58:43.073
<v Speaker 1>I can shift left or right as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>move forward or backwards to move and </v>

3592
02:58:50.281 --> 02:58:53.250
<v Speaker 1>the more lanes you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more two dimensional that is.</v>

3593
02:58:53.850 --> 02:58:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The four.</v>

3594
02:58:54.961 --> 02:58:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five here in los angeles.</v>

3595
02:58:56.550 --> 02:58:59.340
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six lanes each is 12 fricken lanes.</v>

3596
02:58:59.700 --> 02:59:00.533
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are fully exploiting the two </v>

3597
02:59:02.761 --> 02:59:07.440
<v Speaker 1>dimensionality of travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still have so many cars that you</v>

3598
02:59:07.441 --> 02:59:10.620
<v Speaker 1>say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to bypass this traffic.</v>

3599
02:59:11.850 --> 02:59:14.310
<v Speaker 1>If you went from one dimension to two </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions,</v>

3600
02:59:14.460 --> 02:59:19.460
<v Speaker 1>bypassing is just another lane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now all 12 lanes are plugged and you</v>

3601
02:59:19.771 --> 02:59:20.604
<v Speaker 1>want to bypass it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're thinking I need to travel in </v>

3602
02:59:22.651 --> 02:59:26.910
<v Speaker 1>another dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to travel in the third dimension.</v>

3603
02:59:27.870 --> 02:59:31.140
<v Speaker 1>If I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can bypass all these cars.</v>

3604
02:59:31.680 --> 02:59:34.030
<v Speaker 1>I want a flying car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3605
02:59:34.140 --> 02:59:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the point is we already have flying</v>

3606
02:59:38.341 --> 02:59:41.570
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They called helicopters.</v>

3607
02:59:41.800 --> 02:59:43.890
<v Speaker 1>The helicopters originally invented for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3608
02:59:44.360 --> 02:59:45.720
<v Speaker 1>They called helicopters.</v>

3609
02:59:47.820 --> 02:59:51.750
<v Speaker 1>They're noisy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to create a downward thrust of</v>

3610
02:59:51.751 --> 02:59:56.751
<v Speaker 1>air equal to its own weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're gonna have a flying car,</v>

3611
02:59:57.060 --> 03:00:00.990
<v Speaker 1>that's what it's going to have to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>TheY're noisy.</v>

3612
03:00:01.370 --> 03:00:02.203
<v Speaker 1>They're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They completely disrupt the terrain </v>

3613
03:00:05.011 --> 03:00:05.844
<v Speaker 1>wherever they fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the issue is not that you want a </v>

3614
03:00:09.871 --> 03:00:10.704
<v Speaker 1>flying car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to travel in that third </v>

3615
03:00:12.931 --> 03:00:14.150
<v Speaker 1>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

3616
03:00:14.640 --> 03:00:16.700
<v Speaker 1>We already do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we do that?</v>

3617
03:00:16.820 --> 03:00:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Called tunnels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They called bridges.</v>

3618
03:00:20.640 --> 03:00:21.473
<v Speaker 1>When you have a huge intersection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't move people through one </v>

3619
03:00:24.901 --> 03:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You build the,</v>

3620
03:00:28.380 --> 03:00:32.730
<v Speaker 1>you build one road over the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build one road under the other,</v>

3621
03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:33.833
<v Speaker 1>you are exploiting three dimensions so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that traffic can go in perpendicular </v>

3622
03:00:39.691 --> 03:00:40.524
<v Speaker 1>directions simultaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the flying cars would have </v>

3623
03:00:43.831 --> 03:00:44.664
<v Speaker 1>given you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we do that at intersections because </v>

3624
03:00:48.541 --> 03:00:49.374
<v Speaker 1>it would be impossible to move 12 lanes </v>
<v Speaker 1>of traffic through an intersection that </v>

3625
03:00:52.681 --> 03:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>crossed another freeway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New york city has done this.</v>

3626
03:00:58.560 --> 03:00:59.393
<v Speaker 1>We do</v>

3627
03:01:00.370 --> 03:01:02.170
<v Speaker 2>the New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The you're in the streets,</v>

3628
03:01:02.171 --> 03:01:05.390
<v Speaker 2>there's too many cars you can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's move in.</v>

3629
03:01:05.391 --> 03:01:08.770
<v Speaker 2>The third dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's build a subway.</v>

3630
03:01:09.370 --> 03:01:12.370
<v Speaker 2>This sounds like a guy who's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sell me something,</v>

3631
03:01:12.630 --> 03:01:16.180
<v Speaker 2>telling you better than a flying car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>

3632
03:01:16.181 --> 03:01:18.100
<v Speaker 2>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that flying cars bullshit.</v>

3633
03:01:19.560 --> 03:01:21.000
<v Speaker 2>You could buy a flying car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The new.</v>

3634
03:01:21.220 --> 03:01:23.980
<v Speaker 2>I want you to appreciate moving in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>third dimension.</v>

3635
03:01:24.410 --> 03:01:29.410
<v Speaker 2>So New York city subway system moves a </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion people a year and they all go in</v>

3636
03:01:30.281 --> 03:01:34.300
<v Speaker 2>the third dimension beneath the ground </v>
<v Speaker 2>through tunnels,</v>

3637
03:01:34.420 --> 03:01:36.910
<v Speaker 2>tunnels that are layered on top of one </v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

3638
03:01:37.120 --> 03:01:37.953
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the New York city subway system is </v>

3639
03:01:38.651 --> 03:01:40.180
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How doubt about.</v>

3640
03:01:40.230 --> 03:01:42.760
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't move that many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great,</v>

3641
03:01:42.790 --> 03:01:45.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as good as a flying car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not as cool as a flying car,</v>

3642
03:01:46.150 --> 03:01:49.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's as effective as a flying car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The flying car,</v>

3643
03:01:50.660 --> 03:01:51.760
<v Speaker 2>personal flying car.</v>

3644
03:01:51.760 --> 03:01:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Just have to get in line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to get on the subway.</v>

3645
03:01:54.701 --> 03:01:57.540
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to have a token,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to go through the turnstile.</v>

3646
03:01:57.740 --> 03:02:01.060
<v Speaker 2>You have to deal with some guy who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>ruBbing his body up against yours,</v>

3647
03:02:01.410 --> 03:02:02.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flying cars.</v>

3648
03:02:02.741 --> 03:02:03.574
<v Speaker 2>So you just fly around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying it's like a boat </v>

3649
03:02:06.550 --> 03:02:07.383
<v Speaker 2>tunnels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the air and bridges are flying </v>

3650
03:02:09.551 --> 03:02:12.370
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful thing about a boat is you just</v>

3651
03:02:12.371 --> 03:02:14.110
<v Speaker 2>go wherever you want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the thing,</v>

3652
03:02:14.200 --> 03:02:15.033
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to call air traffic </v>

3653
03:02:16.121 --> 03:02:17.440
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was turning left.</v>

3654
03:02:17.590 --> 03:02:18.423
<v Speaker 2>I would take it to another dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not someone will have to know where the </v>

3655
03:02:20.231 --> 03:02:22.360
<v Speaker 2>hell you're flying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Car is going just the same way.</v>

3656
03:02:22.361 --> 03:02:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Traffic rules that are in the street you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>

3657
03:02:24.911 --> 03:02:28.330
<v Speaker 2>there's not as it is with boats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3658
03:02:28.331 --> 03:02:29.760
<v Speaker 2>what happens if a car failed?</v>

3659
03:02:30.150 --> 03:02:32.440
<v Speaker 2>False.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just on the ground.</v>

3660
03:02:32.441 --> 03:02:35.620
<v Speaker 2>At your stops flying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Car fails.</v>

3661
03:02:35.830 --> 03:02:36.860
<v Speaker 2>You're dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3662
03:02:36.970 --> 03:02:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3663
03:02:38.570 --> 03:02:39.403
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to add another dimension to this </v>

3664
03:02:40.361 --> 03:02:41.194
<v Speaker 2>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3665
03:02:41.200 --> 03:02:42.610
<v Speaker 2>are you ready?</v>
<v Speaker 2>On moscow's tunnels.</v>

3666
03:02:42.670 --> 03:02:43.503
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ready?</v>

3667
03:02:43.510 --> 03:02:44.710
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3668
03:02:44.920 --> 03:02:46.720
<v Speaker 2>So watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a desk in front of me.</v>

3669
03:02:47.290 --> 03:02:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3670
03:02:48.161 --> 03:02:50.560
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a physical desk and I have a lot of</v>

3671
03:02:50.561 --> 03:02:54.190
<v Speaker 2>sheets of paper and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I lay them side by side.</v>

3672
03:02:54.430 --> 03:02:56.440
<v Speaker 2>I tiled the desk with all my sheets of </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper.</v>

3673
03:02:56.640 --> 03:03:01.270
<v Speaker 2>Then there's no desk surface left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran out of two dimensional space.</v>

3674
03:03:02.310 --> 03:03:06.550
<v Speaker 2>If I want to store more pages on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>desk,</v>

3675
03:03:06.610 --> 03:03:09.490
<v Speaker 2>what do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get one of those organizers.</v>

3676
03:03:10.540 --> 03:03:11.373
<v Speaker 2>I've just introduced a third dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I could have pages in another </v>

3677
03:03:17.441 --> 03:03:18.274
<v Speaker 2>dimension sitting above the page that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was previously occupying another place </v>

3678
03:03:22.841 --> 03:03:26.440
<v Speaker 2>that I couldn't have put another sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's three dimensions?</v>

3679
03:03:26.590 --> 03:03:27.600
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3680
03:03:28.270 --> 03:03:29.103
<v Speaker 2>If we were two dimensional people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would wonder what happened to that </v>

3681
03:03:32.051 --> 03:03:35.500
<v Speaker 2>sheet of paper because we have no access</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that third dimension.</v>

3682
03:03:36.640 --> 03:03:39.160
<v Speaker 2>It was just left our universe at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

3683
03:03:39.161 --> 03:03:41.620
<v Speaker 2>I'd be trying to back out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>showroom and I'd say,</v>

3684
03:03:41.621 --> 03:03:42.454
<v Speaker 2>thank you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to go to the flying car </v>

3685
03:03:43.241 --> 03:03:44.074
<v Speaker 2>place so now watch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but look at how much you've increased </v>

3686
03:03:47.501 --> 03:03:50.380
<v Speaker 2>your storage by introducing another </v>
<v Speaker 2>dimension.</v>

3687
03:03:51.490 --> 03:03:56.490
<v Speaker 2>Now imagine a fourth spacial dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have access to that,</v>

3688
03:03:57.320 --> 03:03:58.153
<v Speaker 2>but we're now filling all three </v>
<v Speaker 2>dimensions and afforded missional </v>

3689
03:04:01.170 --> 03:04:02.030
<v Speaker 2>creature will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3690
03:04:02.031 --> 03:04:05.480
<v Speaker 2>just put it up in this direction will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fourth dimension.</v>

3691
03:04:05.481 --> 03:04:06.314
<v Speaker 2>In that regard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't imagine it because our brain </v>

3692
03:04:09.981 --> 03:04:12.240
<v Speaker 2>evolved in three dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't.</v>

3693
03:04:12.560 --> 03:04:16.200
<v Speaker 2>We can describe it mathematically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a wormhole in pasadena,</v>

3694
03:04:16.820 --> 03:04:21.820
<v Speaker 2>downtown la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so our storage needs would be come.</v>

3695
03:04:22.400 --> 03:04:26.030
<v Speaker 2>You can open the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it through this portal to the fourth</v>

3696
03:04:26.031 --> 03:04:26.864
<v Speaker 2>dimension and closed the door and look </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other side of the door and </v>

3697
03:04:29.091 --> 03:04:32.570
<v Speaker 2>nothing would be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3698
03:04:33.470 --> 03:04:36.070
<v Speaker 2>just the way on the surface of the desk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you live in the service desk,</v>

3699
03:04:36.170 --> 03:04:38.660
<v Speaker 2>so it opens a door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put the paper through the door,</v>

3700
03:04:38.930 --> 03:04:40.280
<v Speaker 2>close the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you look around and say,</v>

3701
03:04:40.281 --> 03:04:41.114
<v Speaker 2>where did it go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea because you can't even </v>

3702
03:04:42.921 --> 03:04:43.754
<v Speaker 2>see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even imagine that third </v>

3703
03:04:44.781 --> 03:04:47.750
<v Speaker 2>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We cannot imagine a fourth dimension,</v>

3704
03:04:49.040 --> 03:04:49.873
<v Speaker 2>but if the world one day gets so crowded</v>
<v Speaker 2>that even three dimensional space has </v>

3705
03:04:54.711 --> 03:04:55.544
<v Speaker 2>traffic,</v>

3706
03:04:56.890 --> 03:04:58.990
<v Speaker 2>access to a fourth dimension would </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatly help that.</v>

3707
03:04:59.830 --> 03:05:01.750
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3708
03:05:01.780 --> 03:05:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Good luck with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting people to step through ice.</v>

3709
03:05:05.860 --> 03:05:06.693
<v Speaker 2>What is this jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some flying thing that just came out </v>

3710
03:05:08.711 --> 03:05:09.461
<v Speaker 2>last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3711
03:05:09.461 --> 03:05:11.250
<v Speaker 2>look at this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That cgi.</v>

3712
03:05:11.260 --> 03:05:12.093
<v Speaker 2>That part seemed cgi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's actually flying over grass </v>

3713
03:05:14.240 --> 03:05:16.570
<v Speaker 2>that's moving and look at this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

3714
03:05:16.571 --> 03:05:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Solar powered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3715
03:05:19.210 --> 03:05:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trailer,</v>

3716
03:05:20.201 --> 03:05:21.820
<v Speaker 2>like showing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>describing it,</v>

3717
03:05:21.821 --> 03:05:24.410
<v Speaker 2>but didn't have sound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it make sound note?</v>

3718
03:05:24.470 --> 03:05:26.980
<v Speaker 2>It looks like it looks like a human </v>
<v Speaker 2>sized drone.</v>

3719
03:05:27.130 --> 03:05:28.720
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what it looks like.</v>

3720
03:05:29.170 --> 03:05:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about something like this?</v>

3721
03:05:30.760 --> 03:05:31.593
<v Speaker 2>What about something like this with </v>
<v Speaker 2>really powerful magnets all inside the </v>

3722
03:05:35.501 --> 03:05:36.334
<v Speaker 2>outer edge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it repels against other drones to an </v>

3723
03:05:39.031 --> 03:05:41.910
<v Speaker 2>a maglev flying car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you get so close like,</v>

3724
03:05:42.970 --> 03:05:43.803
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it will be like a forcefield each </v>

3725
03:05:45.341 --> 03:05:45.730
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

3726
03:05:45.730 --> 03:05:46.730
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it'd be like.</v>

3727
03:05:47.050 --> 03:05:49.300
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like a bumper cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3728
03:05:49.360 --> 03:05:50.710
<v Speaker 2>But with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With cushions.</v>

3729
03:05:50.711 --> 03:05:51.690
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3730
03:05:51.760 --> 03:05:54.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some sort of electromagnetic force field</v>

3731
03:05:55.180 --> 03:05:56.013
<v Speaker 2>that everyone agrees that you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones that are attracted to each </v>

3732
03:06:00.161 --> 03:06:00.994
<v Speaker 2>other but are opposed by the way you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>how big that human north human sized </v>

3733
03:06:04.460 --> 03:06:06.700
<v Speaker 2>drone it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard how loud a drone?</v>

3734
03:06:06.701 --> 03:06:08.080
<v Speaker 2>it fucking loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

3735
03:06:08.081 --> 03:06:09.640
<v Speaker 2>You can't even have a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3736
03:06:09.641 --> 03:06:11.890
<v Speaker 2>I got an asshole in my neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flies on around you.</v>

3737
03:06:11.900 --> 03:06:12.733
<v Speaker 2>That's what shotguns are for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I had never fired a gun in my </v>

3738
03:06:14.591 --> 03:06:16.270
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first time I've ever used one.</v>

3739
03:06:16.271 --> 03:06:17.104
<v Speaker 2>It's to shoot the drone that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be looking through my window at my </v>

3740
03:06:20.351 --> 03:06:21.370
<v Speaker 2>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3741
03:06:21.371 --> 03:06:22.990
<v Speaker 2>This is fucking asshole in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood.</v>

3742
03:06:22.991 --> 03:06:23.824
<v Speaker 2>He flies all over people's yards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't uncork they already think </v>

3743
03:06:28.001 --> 03:06:28.834
<v Speaker 2>I'm crazy.</v>

3744
03:06:30.490 --> 03:06:33.340
<v Speaker 2>Still play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if I shoot it with a bow and arrow,</v>

3745
03:06:33.341 --> 03:06:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure I'll hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

3746
03:06:34.721 --> 03:06:37.060
<v Speaker 2>did that video have a sound accompanying</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it?</v>

3747
03:06:37.061 --> 03:06:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Has some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>

3748
03:06:37.960 --> 03:06:38.793
<v Speaker 2>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's music and some description of </v>

3749
03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:40.833
<v Speaker 2>music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the actual sound of those </v>

3750
03:06:41.441 --> 03:06:43.780
<v Speaker 2>propellers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they have on their webpage here that</v>

3751
03:06:43.781 --> 03:06:47.470
<v Speaker 2>it's quieter than a car on a freeway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is quieter than electric car?</v>

3752
03:06:47.670 --> 03:06:51.760
<v Speaker 2>Nor at 150 feet away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Measured at a 150 feet.</v>

3753
03:06:51.850 --> 03:06:55.180
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible because it's about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same as far as a car.</v>

3754
03:06:55.380 --> 03:06:56.213
<v Speaker 2>Well it says don't count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're counting that as an electric </v>

3755
03:06:58.561 --> 03:07:00.300
<v Speaker 2>car though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3756
03:07:00.301 --> 03:07:00.930
<v Speaker 2>they are?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3757
03:07:00.930 --> 03:07:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gasoline cars bottom.</v>

3758
03:07:02.870 --> 03:07:05.700
<v Speaker 2>But what is that about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cars today are not in top.</v>

3759
03:07:05.760 --> 03:07:07.170
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to be energy consumption.</v>

3760
03:07:07.171 --> 03:07:09.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if theY're using the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>icon to represent.</v>

3761
03:07:09.271 --> 03:07:11.100
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're using the same electric electric</v>

3762
03:07:11.101 --> 03:07:11.450
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

3763
03:07:11.450 --> 03:07:13.010
<v Speaker 2>So it's the sound of an electric car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3764
03:07:13.080 --> 03:07:13.890
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no engine,</v>

3765
03:07:13.890 --> 03:07:14.723
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get deceived there because that's </v>

3766
03:07:15.541 --> 03:07:16.550
<v Speaker 2>energy consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

3767
03:07:16.570 --> 03:07:19.190
<v Speaker 2>energy consumption uses the same icon </v>
<v Speaker 2>for electric cars.</v>

3768
03:07:19.191 --> 03:07:21.210
<v Speaker 2>It does for gasoline car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then down.</v>

3769
03:07:21.240 --> 03:07:23.160
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see it says noise.</v>

3770
03:07:23.340 --> 03:07:25.230
<v Speaker 2>It shows highway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just car.</v>

3771
03:07:25.231 --> 03:07:27.920
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't tell you what dba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3772
03:07:28.150 --> 03:07:33.150
<v Speaker 2>there's no way 76 dba sound because </v>
<v Speaker 2>electric cars far quieter than a regular</v>

3773
03:07:33.571 --> 03:07:34.404
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The all you hear is the drone of the </v>

3774
03:07:35.461 --> 03:07:36.061
<v Speaker 2>tires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

3775
03:07:36.061 --> 03:07:38.190
<v Speaker 2>but what happens is above a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>speed,</v>

3776
03:07:38.400 --> 03:07:39.233
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the aerodynamic noise is greater than </v>

3777
03:07:42.780 --> 03:07:44.570
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it'll landing airplanes.</v>

3778
03:07:44.600 --> 03:07:45.480
<v Speaker 2>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what you do.</v>

3779
03:07:45.481 --> 03:07:48.690
<v Speaker 2>You live in la,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the in and out near lax,</v>

3780
03:07:49.050 --> 03:07:51.340
<v Speaker 2>which is right near a landing strip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

3781
03:07:51.480 --> 03:07:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And listen to the sound of the planes as</v>

3782
03:07:54.961 --> 03:07:56.640
<v Speaker 2>they come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they come in for a landing,</v>

3783
03:07:57.270 --> 03:08:00.150
<v Speaker 2>most of that sound is airfoil noise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not engine noise.</v>

3784
03:08:00.440 --> 03:08:01.950
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3785
03:08:02.340 --> 03:08:05.280
<v Speaker 2>Which is why you can pretty much still </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain a conversation.</v>

3786
03:08:05.460 --> 03:08:06.293
<v Speaker 2>You're old enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We remember a plane would fly overhead </v>

3787
03:08:08.911 --> 03:08:12.450
<v Speaker 2>in a city and you'd have to halt your </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation until it finished.</v>

3788
03:08:12.540 --> 03:08:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

3789
03:08:15.150 --> 03:08:15.983
<v Speaker 2>Engines got quieter and quieter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has enabled people to build real </v>

3790
03:08:19.261 --> 03:08:23.280
<v Speaker 2>estate closer and closer to airports and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not have not have a sound problem.</v>

3791
03:08:23.340 --> 03:08:25.170
<v Speaker 2>It's poor folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't happen overnight.</v>

3792
03:08:25.200 --> 03:08:27.240
<v Speaker 2>it was slow and steady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No kidding.</v>

3793
03:08:27.470 --> 03:08:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never.</v>

3794
03:08:28.400 --> 03:08:29.233
<v Speaker 2>I forgot her foil noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot that you had to stop talking </v>

3795
03:08:32.671 --> 03:08:33.504
<v Speaker 2>when I remember it effect a shea stadium</v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York city near near laguardia </v>

3796
03:08:38.101 --> 03:08:38.934
<v Speaker 2>airport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The announcers had to stop and he told </v>

3797
03:08:41.461 --> 03:08:42.270
<v Speaker 2>my plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flew over it.</v>

3798
03:08:42.270 --> 03:08:43.103
<v Speaker 2>They could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when the mets won the world </v>

3799
03:08:46.261 --> 03:08:47.094
<v Speaker 2>series in 1969.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mayor lindsay redirected the airport </v>

3800
03:08:51.721 --> 03:08:53.910
<v Speaker 2>traffic to not fly over the world series</v>
<v Speaker 2>games.</v>

3801
03:08:54.160 --> 03:08:54.993
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was a bad ass move of </v>

3802
03:08:56.401 --> 03:08:57.390
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of his mayor.</v>

3803
03:08:57.391 --> 03:08:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Lindsay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3804
03:09:00.060 --> 03:09:02.820
<v Speaker 2>I completely forgot how loud planes you </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be.</v>

3805
03:09:02.821 --> 03:09:03.870
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now they're.</v>

3806
03:09:03.900 --> 03:09:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a sound.</v>

3807
03:09:05.631 --> 03:09:08.220
<v Speaker 2>It's in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the noise of the street.</v>

3808
03:09:08.490 --> 03:09:11.070
<v Speaker 2>You don't even stop and notice it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't even pay attention to all.</v>

3809
03:09:11.071 --> 03:09:12.720
<v Speaker 2>You barely hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You barely hear it.</v>

3810
03:09:12.930 --> 03:09:16.200
<v Speaker 2>And so next time you're at a runway when</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's landing,</v>

3811
03:09:16.201 --> 03:09:17.034
<v Speaker 2>it's much noisier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taking off because it's got a gain </v>

3812
03:09:18.211 --> 03:09:19.890
<v Speaker 2>altitude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but coming down,</v>

3813
03:09:20.150 --> 03:09:22.320
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of that sound is glider noise.</v>

3814
03:09:22.500 --> 03:09:25.210
<v Speaker 2>And evidence of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3815
03:09:25.310 --> 03:09:25.990
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

3816
03:09:25.990 --> 03:09:27.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the noise of air going over the air foil</v>

3817
03:09:27.931 --> 03:09:30.540
<v Speaker 2>of the fuselage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do,</v>

3818
03:09:30.720 --> 03:09:34.350
<v Speaker 2>you know the moment they deploy the </v>
<v Speaker 2>landing gear,</v>

3819
03:09:35.100 --> 03:09:38.160
<v Speaker 2>next time you're in an airplane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they say we are clear for landing,</v>

3820
03:09:38.520 --> 03:09:39.353
<v Speaker 2>just listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to the ambient sound of the </v>

3821
03:09:41.101 --> 03:09:41.934
<v Speaker 2>plane.</v>

3822
03:09:42.510 --> 03:09:43.343
<v Speaker 2>Then listen to the sound after they </v>
<v Speaker 2>deploy the landing gear for three times </v>

3823
03:09:47.101 --> 03:09:47.934
<v Speaker 2>as loud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it ramps up hard part because of the </v>

3824
03:09:49.531 --> 03:09:52.920
<v Speaker 2>sound of the air going around something </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not aerodynamic.</v>

3825
03:09:53.050 --> 03:09:56.150
<v Speaker 2>A fricken wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

3826
03:09:57.280 --> 03:09:59.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just never.</v>

3827
03:10:00.070 --> 03:10:02.200
<v Speaker 2>For whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never remembered that.</v>

3828
03:10:02.230 --> 03:10:05.920
<v Speaker 2>Airplanes used to be louder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about all the time.</v>

3829
03:10:05.950 --> 03:10:10.240
<v Speaker 2>So why can't I have a flying car?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want the drone flying car?</v>

3830
03:10:10.390 --> 03:10:11.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3831
03:10:11.201 --> 03:10:12.370
<v Speaker 2>So you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't want it.</v>

3832
03:10:12.880 --> 03:10:15.400
<v Speaker 2>That would look ugly if two of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>collide and in the sky.</v>

3833
03:10:15.430 --> 03:10:18.450
<v Speaker 2>But what about my magnet theory?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>

3834
03:10:18.730 --> 03:10:22.540
<v Speaker 2>Now it's got to have more power to lift </v>
<v Speaker 2>the weight of the magnet solar pro.</v>

3835
03:10:26.110 --> 03:10:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Plus he gets some testosterone infused </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy who doesn't want to let you ahead of</v>

3836
03:10:29.831 --> 03:10:30.664
<v Speaker 2>them to bump you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of break the propeller and </v>

3837
03:10:33.011 --> 03:10:35.140
<v Speaker 2>then you both fall out of the skus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sky rage,</v>

3838
03:10:35.170 --> 03:10:36.003
<v Speaker 2>sky rage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of dirage we know it'll </v>

3839
03:10:38.681 --> 03:10:39.514
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll cull the herd of testosterone </v>

3840
03:10:40.931 --> 03:10:41.830
<v Speaker 2>driven men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3841
03:10:41.831 --> 03:10:42.664
<v Speaker 2>But what if they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the only way they work is through </v>

3842
03:10:44.711 --> 03:10:49.240
<v Speaker 2>like the same sort of tesla system that </v>
<v Speaker 2>allows them to have automated cars.</v>

3843
03:10:49.340 --> 03:10:50.170
<v Speaker 2>Auto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3844
03:10:50.170 --> 03:10:54.630
<v Speaker 2>Know if you have automated cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need flying cars because first</v>

3845
03:10:54.640 --> 03:10:57.040
<v Speaker 2>of be too many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be fewer cars on the road.</v>

3846
03:10:59.380 --> 03:11:01.210
<v Speaker 2>How do you figure that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>

3847
03:11:02.350 --> 03:11:04.680
<v Speaker 2>Automated cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fewer cars in the us.</v>

3848
03:11:04.870 --> 03:11:05.890
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>

3849
03:11:05.950 --> 03:11:07.150
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>

3850
03:11:07.240 --> 03:11:11.920
<v Speaker 2>because what your second greatest asset </v>
<v Speaker 2>your car.</v>

3851
03:11:11.921 --> 03:11:12.754
<v Speaker 2>Most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>second greatest asset spends 90 percent </v>

3852
03:11:14.441 --> 03:11:15.400
<v Speaker 2>of his time doing nothing.</v>

3853
03:11:17.040 --> 03:11:21.960
<v Speaker 2>You drive to work and it's parked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You come home and it's parked 90 percent</v>

3854
03:11:21.961 --> 03:11:23.420
<v Speaker 2>of his time doing nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3855
03:11:23.460 --> 03:11:26.250
<v Speaker 2>I come to work 10 minutes after you a </v>
<v Speaker 2>half hour after you.</v>

3856
03:11:26.340 --> 03:11:28.560
<v Speaker 2>An hour after you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm using your car.</v>

3857
03:11:28.590 --> 03:11:31.200
<v Speaker 2>You ain't using my card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you right now.</v>

3858
03:11:31.260 --> 03:11:34.230
<v Speaker 2>You're not using my car up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's using the race car.</v>

3859
03:11:34.231 --> 03:11:36.210
<v Speaker 2>I forgot this is la.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you go to New York?</v>

3860
03:11:36.220 --> 03:11:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Happen for people where they steal your </v>
<v Speaker 2>car is a utility rather than a.</v>

3861
03:11:41.650 --> 03:11:44.350
<v Speaker 2>Something to try to get chicks with on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the street corner.</v>

3862
03:11:44.370 --> 03:11:45.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

3863
03:11:45.030 --> 03:11:46.910
<v Speaker 2>He will try to get chicks in New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

3864
03:11:46.911 --> 03:11:49.620
<v Speaker 2>Don't do enough with the cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that do.</v>

3865
03:11:49.680 --> 03:11:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you do,</v>

3866
03:11:51.181 --> 03:11:53.280
<v Speaker 2>you're a baller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got one of them spots.</v>

3867
03:11:53.281 --> 03:11:55.980
<v Speaker 2>It cost you a thousand bucks a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

3868
03:11:57.870 --> 03:12:00.440
<v Speaker 2>I've seen some fancy cars and I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York system.</v>

3869
03:12:00.520 --> 03:12:01.590
<v Speaker 2>Fancy guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not.</v>

3870
03:12:01.860 --> 03:12:03.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not 100 percent.</v>

3871
03:12:03.451 --> 03:12:04.530
<v Speaker 2>It's not 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3872
03:12:04.531 --> 03:12:07.910
<v Speaker 2>but that's just that one stupid spot </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you still own the car,</v>

3873
03:12:08.100 --> 03:12:11.190
<v Speaker 2>but you'll be delegate relegated to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lane where you won't be able to drive as</v>

3874
03:12:11.191 --> 03:12:12.024
<v Speaker 2>fast as the automatic or consider that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're in a self driving car and it </v>

3875
03:12:15.421 --> 03:12:16.254
<v Speaker 2>wants to change lanes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it communicates that to other self </v>

3876
03:12:18.211 --> 03:12:21.030
<v Speaker 2>driving cars near it and have self </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving cars tell you to fuck off.</v>

3877
03:12:21.230 --> 03:12:26.230
<v Speaker 2>You have a program like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe rogan upload rude russian bot call.</v>

3878
03:12:29.540 --> 03:12:32.850
<v Speaker 2>It's not letting anybody in the joe </v>
<v Speaker 2>rogan upload.</v>

3879
03:12:32.990 --> 03:12:33.823
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it wouldn't change anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's automated cars and los </v>

3880
03:12:37.711 --> 03:12:38.760
<v Speaker 2>angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

3881
03:12:39.030 --> 03:12:39.863
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there'd be any less </v>

3882
03:12:40.861 --> 03:12:41.694
<v Speaker 2>traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to make a lane that'll </v>

3883
03:12:42.901 --> 03:12:43.734
<v Speaker 2>take automated cars and it will go 120 </v>
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour and watching everybody </v>

3884
03:12:47.010 --> 03:12:51.340
<v Speaker 2>with their wasted horsepower in their.</v>

3885
03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:53.840
<v Speaker 2>In their inactive trapped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck in traffic.</v>

3886
03:12:55.010 --> 03:12:55.843
<v Speaker 2>I was tweeting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in la and I was in like a prius </v>

3887
03:12:57.560 --> 03:12:58.393
<v Speaker 2>and we passed a lamborghini doing 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour and that was just seemed </v>

3888
03:13:04.021 --> 03:13:09.021
<v Speaker 2>so embarrassing to the lamborghini.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doing 30 miles.</v>

3889
03:13:09.500 --> 03:13:10.670
<v Speaker 2>How are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forty miles an hour.</v>

3890
03:13:10.970 --> 03:13:12.970
<v Speaker 2>We pass the lambert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3891
03:13:13.250 --> 03:13:15.830
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you have a lamborghini?</v>

3892
03:13:15.860 --> 03:13:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Because there's sometimes when there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>no one on the road,</v>

3893
03:13:19.740 --> 03:13:20.573
<v Speaker 2>not from what I've never seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just kind of got a lamborghini drive </v>

3894
03:13:24.181 --> 03:13:28.910
<v Speaker 2>late at night and the lamborghini is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>peacock feathers as best as I can.</v>

3895
03:13:28.911 --> 03:13:29.960
<v Speaker 2>Judge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever driven one?</v>

3896
03:13:30.440 --> 03:13:31.273
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two wonderful marvel of engineering and </v>

3897
03:13:33.771 --> 03:13:34.604
<v Speaker 2>science and she'd appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A good thing goes zero to 62 and a half </v>

3898
03:13:37.761 --> 03:13:39.350
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're still burning gas.</v>

3899
03:13:39.740 --> 03:13:40.910
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't like gas?</v>

3900
03:13:41.210 --> 03:13:43.640
<v Speaker 2>Not if I don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You prefer electric.</v>

3901
03:13:43.641 --> 03:13:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Like if you had a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you lived in it for whatever reason,</v>

3902
03:13:45.981 --> 03:13:48.330
<v Speaker 2>the planetarium decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look neil,</v>

3903
03:13:48.450 --> 03:13:49.580
<v Speaker 2>you're the best ever.</v>

3904
03:13:49.640 --> 03:13:51.500
<v Speaker 2>And we opened up the most amazing spot </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

3905
03:13:51.501 --> 03:13:53.630
<v Speaker 2>it's in los angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

3906
03:13:53.910 --> 03:13:57.270
<v Speaker 2>We'd love you to relocate and start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a car.</v>

3907
03:13:57.450 --> 03:13:58.283
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was forced to relocate and I had </v>

3908
03:14:00.621 --> 03:14:01.454
<v Speaker 2>only one car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd get an electric car will probably </v>

3909
03:14:03.771 --> 03:14:05.800
<v Speaker 2>attempt to get a prius or a tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you go?</v>

3910
03:14:05.810 --> 03:14:06.643
<v Speaker 2>Definitely tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3911
03:14:06.650 --> 03:14:07.483
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't want like their </v>

3912
03:14:09.810 --> 03:14:11.160
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slice of cheese.</v>

3913
03:14:11.170 --> 03:14:14.200
<v Speaker 2>what is the biggest prius?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying.</v>

3914
03:14:14.230 --> 03:14:15.063
<v Speaker 2>I know it's an important Car that set a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of other manufacturers into motion </v>

3915
03:14:19.450 --> 03:14:20.570
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3916
03:14:20.920 --> 03:14:23.750
<v Speaker 2>there's a dynamic to shitbox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a dynamic.</v>

3917
03:14:23.870 --> 03:14:28.070
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing happens and the drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>something else that makes that happen.</v>

3918
03:14:28.550 --> 03:14:31.340
<v Speaker 2>But when you plug your car into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wall,</v>

3919
03:14:31.940 --> 03:14:34.730
<v Speaker 2>you're not asking yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder where this power comes from.</v>

3920
03:14:34.910 --> 03:14:38.840
<v Speaker 2>It could come from any one of a dozen </v>
<v Speaker 2>sources like hydro.</v>

3921
03:14:38.841 --> 03:14:42.890
<v Speaker 2>It could be a pet solar panels or tidal </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

3922
03:14:42.891 --> 03:14:46.220
<v Speaker 2>It could come from nukes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could come from oil or coal,</v>

3923
03:14:46.520 --> 03:14:48.470
<v Speaker 2>come from any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about clean coal?</v>

3924
03:14:48.500 --> 03:14:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clean coal.</v>

3925
03:14:49.731 --> 03:14:52.700
<v Speaker 2>The president's been tweeting about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean coal,</v>

3926
03:14:52.701 --> 03:14:54.100
<v Speaker 2>all capital letters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3927
03:14:54.110 --> 03:14:55.990
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know about that.</v>

3928
03:14:55.991 --> 03:14:57.470
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was just fucking cold.</v>

3929
03:15:00.880 --> 03:15:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Cold feet tweet is so here's my point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can.</v>

3930
03:15:04.490 --> 03:15:08.840
<v Speaker 2>If you can power things with the choice </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a dozen sources of energy,</v>

3931
03:15:09.110 --> 03:15:11.990
<v Speaker 2>then those sources of energy compete </v>
<v Speaker 2>with one another for your business.</v>

3932
03:15:12.890 --> 03:15:14.540
<v Speaker 2>As the price of oil goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he say,</v>

3933
03:15:14.630 --> 03:15:16.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to generate power with </v>
<v Speaker 2>oil,</v>

3934
03:15:16.910 --> 03:15:20.630
<v Speaker 2>going to use the and I have a wind farm </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I come online.</v>

3935
03:15:20.900 --> 03:15:24.710
<v Speaker 2>I want to sell you my wind energy and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're the power company.</v>

3936
03:15:24.711 --> 03:15:25.544
<v Speaker 2>You buy my wind energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You send that power to the wall outlet </v>

3937
03:15:27.830 --> 03:15:28.663
<v Speaker 2>and you charging your car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't know and don't care where that </v>

3938
03:15:31.641 --> 03:15:32.930
<v Speaker 2>energy came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

3939
03:15:34.160 --> 03:15:37.880
<v Speaker 2>There's a book called turning oil into </v>
<v Speaker 2>salt.</v>

3940
03:15:38.360 --> 03:15:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Look it up so we caN mention turning oil</v>
<v Speaker 2>into salt.</v>

3941
03:15:40.820 --> 03:15:43.220
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want to do that?</v>

3942
03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:48.560
<v Speaker 2>There was a day when salt was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategic commodity.</v>

3943
03:15:49.080 --> 03:15:50.160
<v Speaker 2>There was no other known</v>

3944
03:15:50.160 --> 03:15:55.160
<v Speaker 1>way to preserve food from the autumn </v>
<v Speaker 1>harvest to the spring set of crops.</v>

3945
03:15:56.100 --> 03:15:58.410
<v Speaker 1>So food got salted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3946
03:15:58.411 --> 03:15:59.244
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3947
03:15:59.250 --> 03:16:00.300
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the book.</v>

3948
03:16:00.301 --> 03:16:01.980
<v Speaker 1>What's the woman's name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A gal left and,</v>

3949
03:16:02.010 --> 03:16:03.120
<v Speaker 1>and koren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3950
03:16:03.780 --> 03:16:07.710
<v Speaker 1>So I'm now describing the thesis of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

3951
03:16:08.160 --> 03:16:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turning oil into salt.</v>

3952
03:16:10.290 --> 03:16:13.230
<v Speaker 1>So here's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have soft.</v>

3953
03:16:13.830 --> 03:16:17.910
<v Speaker 1>If I took away your assault reserves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would starve over the winter.</v>

3954
03:16:18.540 --> 03:16:20.690
<v Speaker 1>So everybody knew where their salt came </v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

3955
03:16:20.820 --> 03:16:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew how much their salt cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>

3956
03:16:23.820 --> 03:16:24.653
<v Speaker 1>do you realize that grant general grant </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy the salt reserves or the </v>

3957
03:16:28.861 --> 03:16:29.694
<v Speaker 1>southern confederacy knowing that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would force them faster to surrender </v>

3958
03:16:36.031 --> 03:16:38.910
<v Speaker 1>because they wouldn't have food reserves</v>
<v Speaker 1>to last through the winter.</v>

3959
03:16:39.960 --> 03:16:40.793
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up net did not understand the </v>

3960
03:16:42.331 --> 03:16:43.740
<v Speaker 1>phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are the salt of the earth,</v>

3961
03:16:44.800 --> 03:16:46.620
<v Speaker 1>so it gives you high blood pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

3962
03:16:46.660 --> 03:16:47.160
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

3963
03:16:47.160 --> 03:16:50.350
<v Speaker 1>The salt to their stop saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

3964
03:16:50.790 --> 03:16:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Sodium does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3965
03:16:52.050 --> 03:16:52.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really have too much right </v>

3966
03:16:53.790 --> 03:16:54.623
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3967
03:16:54.690 --> 03:16:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3968
03:16:55.360 --> 03:16:57.640
<v Speaker 1>But let's get that in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me finish the thing.</v>

3969
03:16:59.280 --> 03:17:01.860
<v Speaker 1>So they give them something wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 1>you for that to happen.</v>

3970
03:17:01.890 --> 03:17:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>

3971
03:17:04.680 --> 03:17:06.940
<v Speaker 1>whether it's chronic or not that I agree</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you there.</v>

3972
03:17:07.150 --> 03:17:09.460
<v Speaker 1>If you're chronic high blood pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just this right?</v>

3973
03:17:10.110 --> 03:17:10.943
<v Speaker 1>But I can increase my blood pressure now</v>
<v Speaker 1>by not peeing and taking and ingesting </v>

3974
03:17:15.541 --> 03:17:17.880
<v Speaker 1>salt by not paying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you not pay?</v>

3975
03:17:18.030 --> 03:17:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you retain the water and it gets</v>

3976
03:17:20.250 --> 03:17:21.083
<v Speaker 1>pumped through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what the salt as you retain the </v>

3977
03:17:21.991 --> 03:17:22.824
<v Speaker 1>limit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it let me get back to the soccer </v>

3978
03:17:23.890 --> 03:17:25.980
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3979
03:17:26.220 --> 03:17:28.320
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I said,</v>

3980
03:17:28.321 --> 03:17:29.760
<v Speaker 1>salt of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that a Compliment?</v>

3981
03:17:29.761 --> 03:17:30.594
<v Speaker 1>I remember thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a day when salt really </v>

3982
03:17:32.851 --> 03:17:33.540
<v Speaker 1>mattered.</v>

3983
03:17:33.540 --> 03:17:34.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

3984
03:17:34.950 --> 03:17:37.460
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3985
03:17:37.890 --> 03:17:41.340
<v Speaker 1>so what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19th century,</v>

3986
03:17:41.370 --> 03:17:46.370
<v Speaker 1>we figured out how to can foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

3987
03:17:46.500 --> 03:17:48.660
<v Speaker 1>you can have berries and put them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We Can.</v>

3988
03:17:48.661 --> 03:17:49.494
<v Speaker 1>Then we seal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make preserves the name of the </v>

3989
03:17:52.591 --> 03:17:55.500
<v Speaker 1>food is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's preserved.</v>

3990
03:17:56.010 --> 03:17:56.843
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we this another way to protect </v>

3991
03:17:59.161 --> 03:17:59.994
<v Speaker 1>yoUr food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have it last through times when you </v>

3992
03:18:02.851 --> 03:18:06.090
<v Speaker 1>don't have crops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

3993
03:18:06.240 --> 03:18:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Refrigeration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get we have electricity.</v>

3994
03:18:08.720 --> 03:18:11.760
<v Speaker 1>You can refrigerate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute,</v>

3995
03:18:12.480 --> 03:18:13.313
<v Speaker 1>I can now fleece food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a half dozen ways I can eat over </v>

3996
03:18:20.011 --> 03:18:20.844
<v Speaker 1>the winter and only one of them is salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now salt has lost its strategic </v>

3997
03:18:27.390 --> 03:18:28.980
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lost his mojo,</v>

3998
03:18:29.150 --> 03:18:31.080
<v Speaker 1>lost his mojo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still there.</v>

3999
03:18:31.440 --> 03:18:34.000
<v Speaker 1>We still eat salted foods as well as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

4000
03:18:34.100 --> 03:18:36.330
<v Speaker 1>over for flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's a different thing.</v>

4001
03:18:36.331 --> 03:18:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a different thing now.</v>

4002
03:18:38.190 --> 03:18:40.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a matter of necessity.</v>

4003
03:18:40.890 --> 03:18:42.600
<v Speaker 1>A lot of great foods came out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4004
03:18:42.601 --> 03:18:43.434
<v Speaker 1>the salted pork and the bacon and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very tasty foods came out of that </v>

4005
03:18:47.140 --> 03:18:48.280
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4006
03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:52.810
<v Speaker 1>So right now when you buy salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know where it came from?</v>

4007
03:18:52.870 --> 03:18:54.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you get hawaiian salt,</v>

4008
03:18:54.730 --> 03:18:58.330
<v Speaker 1>that should get gourmet salt from foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just buying morton salt.</v>

4009
03:18:58.331 --> 03:18:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Do you know where it came from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4010
03:19:00.010 --> 03:19:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember how much it costs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

4011
03:19:02.470 --> 03:19:04.990
<v Speaker 1>It's too cheap for eve viewed even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that?</v>

4012
03:19:05.170 --> 03:19:08.440
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to turn oil into salt,</v>

4013
03:19:09.460 --> 03:19:11.770
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is you're turning </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy into salt.</v>

4014
03:19:13.210 --> 03:19:14.043
<v Speaker 1>That's the value of a plug in the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Design a car that can run on five </v>

4015
03:19:18.461 --> 03:19:19.294
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of energy than oil has </v>
<v Speaker 1>to compete with the other kinds of </v>

4016
03:19:22.631 --> 03:19:23.320
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4017
03:19:23.320 --> 03:19:24.153
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So have an engine that's a works on </v>

4018
03:19:26.501 --> 03:19:27.810
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>

4019
03:19:27.940 --> 03:19:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4020
03:19:28.280 --> 03:19:28.751
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4021
03:19:28.751 --> 03:19:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Hydrogen fuel cells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4022
03:19:31.080 --> 03:19:31.913
<v Speaker 1>batteries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have hybrids now that work on </v>

4023
03:19:33.851 --> 03:19:35.410
<v Speaker 1>two different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a start,</v>

4024
03:19:35.411 --> 03:19:40.411
<v Speaker 1>but my point is if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we no longer fight wars for oil.</v>

4025
03:19:42.530 --> 03:19:43.363
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4026
03:19:44.900 --> 03:19:48.440
<v Speaker 1>what do we fight for now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't fight for freedom.</v>

4027
03:19:48.690 --> 03:19:49.670
<v Speaker 1>How about freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro?</v>

4028
03:19:50.300 --> 03:19:54.800
<v Speaker 1>Freedom isn't free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freedom isn't free.</v>

4029
03:19:54.860 --> 03:19:57.290
