00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:05.670
<v Speaker 1>the reason you key I and shout is to create intrabdominal pressure so you can</v>

4
00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>stabilize the system.</v>

5
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you not me.</v>

6
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>You sound like you use magic bro.</v>

7
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>When I'm key I a you throw fireballs,</v>

8
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>the shrine in my mind.</v>

9
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.920
<v Speaker 1>So the third thing is that we create,</v>

10
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>we screw the feet into the ground,</v>

11
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.751
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

12
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>This torsion of kind of creating grip through the,</v>

13
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>through the like the same sort of grip you go towards no externally rotate,</v>

14
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

15
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

16
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Wax On.</v>

17
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Wax Off was teaching what Steven Seagal always throws in the same position,</v>

18
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>screwing a light bulb minutes the way he runs on,</v>

19
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.500
<v Speaker 1>look at the way he runs.</v>

20
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.583
<v Speaker 1>You ever see him run?</v>

21
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfect example.</v>

22
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Pull up Steven Seagal running.</v>

23
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.881
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

24
00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfect example of see if Kelly can fix the way Steven Seagal runs and</v>

25
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:46.510
<v Speaker 1>this is no back to the Stevens.</v>

26
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Augustine's number to call is an excellent martial artist and he's very good at</v>

27
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Ikea.</v>

28
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was one of the first Japanese Americans rather to teach in Japan.</v>

29
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>This right had a legitimate respected Dojo.</v>

30
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 1>So now Kido is,</v>

31
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>has they figured out to throw people,</v>

32
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>you're wining the shoulder up into what position?</v>

33
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.473
<v Speaker 1>This extra.</v>

34
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

35
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to tremendous amount of power with that.</v>

36
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.790
<v Speaker 1>US wells with judo.</v>

37
00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Same position that's rolled.</v>

38
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.860
<v Speaker 1>Getting getting yourself in a position.</v>

39
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.083
<v Speaker 1>We'll get him running.</v>

40
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Tell,</v>

41
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>tell me what's wrong here.</v>

42
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Everything is wrong.</v>

43
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.331
<v Speaker 1>He has a lot wrong.</v>

44
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:16.164
<v Speaker 1>They're right.</v>

45
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Ge taught him how to run the Louis.</v>

46
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

47
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>he's got to look at this.</v>

48
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Look how he's running.</v>

49
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.263
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

50
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.411
<v Speaker 1>it's not bad.</v>

52
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>He's running on the ball of his foot.</v>

53
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I've seen why worse.</v>

54
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Let's back now he's getting older.</v>

55
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:28.944
<v Speaker 1>He's getting over extended.</v>

56
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:29.251
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

57
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:29.721
<v Speaker 1>you got it.</v>

58
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.300
<v Speaker 1>And that this is different.</v>

60
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.540
<v Speaker 1>This is this.</v>

61
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.001
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

62
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:33.661
<v Speaker 1>this is the guy who started,</v>

63
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:35.820
<v Speaker 1>gets stiff and fly around and play a little too much music.</v>

64
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Everybody talks shit about him.</v>

65
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:37.891
<v Speaker 1>But the dude,</v>

66
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:38.491
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad ass.</v>

67
00:01:38.491 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Legitimate martial artists.</v>

68
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>He knows a lot about Marshall.</v>

69
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.140
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be a navy seal cook.</v>

70
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>If after I saw where this police don't Machita legitimately takes advice from</v>

71
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:46.621
<v Speaker 1>that guy.</v>

72
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thinks it's bullshit and they think I'm just trolling Lubick Liotta</v>

73
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Machita respects that guy enough to take instruction from him and to listen to</v>

74
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:54.310
<v Speaker 1>him talk.</v>

75
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

76
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.961
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't,</v>

77
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:57.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean he figured a lot things out the keys.</v>

78
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>A lot of us don't have sort of the Meta cognition where I want to see if he runs</v>

79
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:02.544
<v Speaker 1>on his toes though.</v>

80
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I need to see that ball of the foot.</v>

81
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:04.681
<v Speaker 1>So let's,</v>

82
00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>let's take a couple of conversations with all the foot is good ball.</v>

83
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.881
<v Speaker 1>Let's be clear.</v>

84
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:09.691
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how he's running.</v>

85
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>There was either running,</v>

86
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.391
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

87
00:02:11.391 --> 00:02:12.121
<v Speaker 1>we're not running.</v>

88
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>He'll first man guys breast out.</v>

89
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.081
<v Speaker 1>He's hitting.</v>

90
00:02:15.081 --> 00:02:15.720
<v Speaker 1>He'll first.</v>

91
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

92
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.711
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

93
00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:17.840
<v Speaker 1>That's actually not gonna stop that running.</v>

94
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.101
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

95
00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:18.220
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

96
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

97
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.900
<v Speaker 1>That guy is flat footed.</v>

98
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:22.521
<v Speaker 1>When he's landing,</v>

99
00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>he is running terrible and your foot flat footed is okay.</v>

100
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>What's not okay?</v>

101
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Ball of the foot strikes first.</v>

102
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.801
<v Speaker 1>That's not okay.</v>

103
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:29.480
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

104
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.621
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

105
00:02:29.621 --> 00:02:29.820
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

106
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.290
<v Speaker 1>there's some variation that what he's doing.</v>

107
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

108
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.431
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to tell.</v>

109
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:32.761
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking,</v>

110
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:33.594
<v Speaker 1>it's not hard to tell him.</v>

111
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.770
<v Speaker 1>He's moving really fast.</v>

112
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:35.431
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking shit.</v>

113
00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean it might have been all the foot.</v>

114
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:37.661
<v Speaker 1>Here's what,</v>

115
00:02:37.661 --> 00:02:38.494
<v Speaker 1>here's what I would think.</v>

116
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>That's less efficient.</v>

117
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:42.774
<v Speaker 1>What's going on now?</v>

118
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.613
<v Speaker 1>What's all that about?</v>

119
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Unstable.</v>

120
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Unstable,</v>

121
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 1>so unstable.</v>

122
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.600
<v Speaker 1>And that's what he's,</v>

123
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.411
<v Speaker 1>he's looking for.</v>

124
00:02:47.411 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

125
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>that's how we use this as like Quito though.</v>

126
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:50.101
<v Speaker 1>He's all,</v>

127
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>he's like with like,</v>

128
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.481
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

129
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:53.160
<v Speaker 1>so you mean practice makes permanent?</v>

130
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.720
<v Speaker 1>This is that a whole bunch.</v>

131
00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:55.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's the only way.</v>

132
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>So even when he runs,</v>

133
00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>he's got that sort of whipping motion going on when his arms,</v>

134
00:02:59.591 --> 00:03:00.321
<v Speaker 1>it kind of makes sense.</v>

135
00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:00.941
<v Speaker 1>So totally.</v>

136
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>We teach people to run.</v>

137
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:02.231
<v Speaker 1>We say,</v>

138
00:03:02.231 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

139
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>pretend like you're grabbing two chips.</v>

140
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.983
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

141
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Put your shoulders in this position.</v>

142
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>This extra rotated position makes you shoulder stable.</v>

143
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>It creates the building in the head.</v>

144
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>What you'll see is that people are on your chips,</v>

145
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

146
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Chips.</v>

147
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Like you have two potentials.</v>

148
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Don't cross the chips.</v>

149
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Two of them.</v>

150
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you're grabbing something else and you don't.</v>

151
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.233
<v Speaker 1>You want to be gentle.</v>

152
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

153
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

154
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.681
<v Speaker 1>Can you say,</v>

155
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>why would you say my name is Coco?</v>

156
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:22.541
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

157
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Like pull your elbows tight.</v>

158
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

159
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.901
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

160
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:26.734
<v Speaker 1>this is how you should be running.</v>

161
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>You're just holding onto the ships.</v>

162
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 1>This is how you'd run a protect those checks.</v>

163
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>So where,</v>

164
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>where was his hands going?</v>

165
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:32.704
<v Speaker 1>Across his body.</v>

166
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>So how much force is he given away?</v>

167
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>All of that.</v>

168
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>So my hands coming across,</v>

169
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:36.701
<v Speaker 1>I got to stop that.</v>

170
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a heavy load.</v>

171
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I want to minimize that.</v>

172
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>When you see kids running with their elbows out,</v>

173
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.621
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

174
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Like RTD too.</v>

175
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

176
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.841
<v Speaker 1>That's a test.</v>

177
00:03:43.841 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>That's c three Po runs with his arms out.</v>

178
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

179
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>What is the r two d two doesn't have arms.</v>

180
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm just letting you talk to him.</v>

181
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.083
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

182
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.323
<v Speaker 1>I'll try it.</v>

183
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.470
<v Speaker 1>See if you're here to stay in your here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>

185
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.331
<v Speaker 1>Still rewinding.</v>

186
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:56.880
<v Speaker 1>You were talking about squeezing that butt early.</v>

187
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>We're coming back.</v>

188
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.383
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

189
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.340
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
