<v Speaker 1>It's a bad ass service.</v>

9
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the coolest ways to spend time,</v>

10
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.750
<v Speaker 1>whether it's in traffic or stuck on a train somewhere in a plane or whenever</v>

11
00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>you're just forced to just sit there.</v>

12
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.920
<v Speaker 1>It makes that time so much better to have a good audio book.</v>

13
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:41.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.430
<v Speaker 1>I've been a fan of audio books forever and audible is taken to the next level</v>

17
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.540
<v Speaker 1>with this thing they have called whisper sync and this is in an application they</v>

18
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>developed for the kindle fire Hd.</v>

19
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.080
<v Speaker 1>And what it is,</v>

20
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:55.340
<v Speaker 1>is when you're reading a book,</v>

21
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>you read a book on the kindle and say like,</v>

22
00:00:57.141 --> 00:01:01.430
<v Speaker 1>you get to page 10 and you fall asleep when you get up in the morning and get in</v>

23
00:01:01.431 --> 00:01:02.264
<v Speaker 1>your car,</v>

24
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.670
<v Speaker 1>your car will start playing an audio version of the book right where you left</v>

25
00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:08.390
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

26
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.950
<v Speaker 1>It's such a cool move.</v>

27
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.911
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uninformed Americans.</v>

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.870
<v Speaker 1>It is funny that I'm like,</v>

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.460
<v Speaker 1>they have to change those,</v>

183

<v Speaker 1>those characters and to translate your name into English and put it into a sound</v>

<v Speaker 1>and for different people at disputes on how you should do that.</v>

185
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.200
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking crazy because it's like taking a photo and being like,</v>

186
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:38.930
<v Speaker 3>how's that photo sound home?</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

188
00:05:39.901 --> 00:05:41.310

193
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:47.150
<v Speaker 1>it's like taking a photo because the way you guys look at like language,</v>

194
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese competitors totally different.</v>

195
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a different way of looking at the whole world.</v>

196
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

197
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a mind fuck and a half right?</v>

198
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.370
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of caveman steve because it's like,</v>

199
00:05:56.371 --> 00:05:56.671
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

203

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.071
<v Speaker 3>It's cool.</v>

205
00:06:00.071 --> 00:06:00.940
<v Speaker 3>It's very like,</v>

206
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.980
<v Speaker 3>it's an artistic fucking language.</v>

207
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.390
<v Speaker 3>Definitely like it a lot.</v>

208
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.691
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

209
00:06:04.691 --> 00:06:05.170
<v Speaker 3>it's good.</v>

210
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 3>It looks good on people when you talk to it too.</v>

211
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.870
<v Speaker 3>But the funniest shit is like white boy Asian tattoos.</v>

212
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.430
<v Speaker 3>Like see what duties,</v>

213
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.730
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

214
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.020
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

215
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.940
<v Speaker 3>what's the same motherfucker that says energy on your arm?</v>

216
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:17.850
<v Speaker 3>Like you're like a red bull ahead.</v>

217
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.340
<v Speaker 3>You wrote energy on your arm.</v>

218
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.700
<v Speaker 1>The digital and mobile energy positivity.</v>

219
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm all about putting on my consciousness to the universe.</v>

220
00:06:29.891 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese tattoos.</v>

221
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.610
<v Speaker 1>They say that the Gypson language of hieroglyphs is an even bigger mind fuck.</v>

222
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Because they,</v>

223
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 1>they see everything in these,</v>

224
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:41.600
<v Speaker 1>like these symbols,</v>

225
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

226
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:47.240
<v Speaker 1>and that we are the way Americans and people read English language the way we</v>

227
00:06:47.241 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 1>look at.</v>

228
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Just even like the way you'll,</v>

229
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.070
<v Speaker 1>you'll look at sentences.</v>

230
00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:55.850
<v Speaker 1>It's completely different than if you tried to read like hieroglyphics.</v>

231
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.401
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

232
00:06:56.401 --> 00:06:58.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't read hieroglyphics,</v>

233
00:06:58.261 --> 00:06:59.880
<v Speaker 3>but I heard that shit is mad hard.</v>

234
00:06:59.881 --> 00:07:01.200
<v Speaker 3>They needed this stone for it.</v>

235
00:07:01.201 --> 00:07:02.190
<v Speaker 3>The Rosetta stone.</v>

236
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:02.521
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

237
00:07:02.521 --> 00:07:03.354
<v Speaker 3>they did.</v>

238
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

239
00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:05.490
<v Speaker 3>Hieroglyphics or some shit,</v>

240
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.460
<v Speaker 3>if that's even more caveman than,</v>

241
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:08.191
<v Speaker 3>than Mandarin.</v>

242
00:07:08.191 --> 00:07:12.060
<v Speaker 3>Chinese like Chinese is almost like refined hieroglyphics,</v>

243
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.740
<v Speaker 3>but it still makes no sense.</v>

244
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.041
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

245
00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:14.750
<v Speaker 3>the fascinating</v>

246
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:15.610
<v Speaker 1>thing about the,</v>

247

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

248
00:07:15.731 --> 00:07:20.731
<v Speaker 1>the hieroglyphics is that they depict all of the Pharaohs and they depict them</v>

249
00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:24.020
<v Speaker 1>from this whatever dynasty.</v>

250
00:07:24.021 --> 00:07:24.351
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

253
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.900
<v Speaker 1>the last pharaohs existed in to what gets into like fiction,</v>

254
00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:32.090
<v Speaker 1>they think like 30,000 years.</v>

255
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Like then they live in like hundreds years long and they're fucking 10 feet</v>

256
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:35.970
<v Speaker 1>tall.</v>

257
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.400
<v Speaker 1>It gets like real wacky,</v>

258
00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 1>like as shit gets like super,</v>

259
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:43.550

260
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:44.384
<v Speaker 1>write them down.</v>

261
00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 1>So it makes you wonder like,</v>

262

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

265

<v Speaker 3>Yoshi did give me the heads up bogus.</v>

268
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:54.690
<v Speaker 3>Yo.</v>

270
00:07:56.181 --> 00:07:56.910
<v Speaker 3>Motherfucker.</v>

271
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan is a smart motherfucker.</v>

272
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:04.110
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm just fascinated by weird shit like the Egyptian culture Egypt in</v>

273
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:04.520
<v Speaker 3>culture.</v>

274
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.353
<v Speaker 3>That's the cradle,</v>

275
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:05.841
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

276
00:08:05.841 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 3>That's where everybody came from.</v>

277
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 3>Supposedly.</v>

278
00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:08.963
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

279
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

280
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.413
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

281
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.100
<v Speaker 1>the only issue is that there's some new shit they've been finding that's even</v>

282
00:08:14.101 --> 00:08:14.934
<v Speaker 1>older than that.</v>

283
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.640
<v Speaker 1>The real question when it gets to like something like Egypt or anywhere we've</v>

284
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.841
<v Speaker 1>had some really,</v>

285
00:08:21.841 --> 00:08:23.730
<v Speaker 1>really old shit is like,</v>

286
00:08:23.731 --> 00:08:27.210
<v Speaker 1>what happens if you find shit that's way older and what do you do then?</v>

287
00:08:27.211 --> 00:08:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't say the Egypt was like the oldest,</v>

288
00:08:29.911 --> 00:08:34.320
<v Speaker 1>like really advanced culture when you find like go back lay tappy which is in</v>

289
00:08:34.321 --> 00:08:35.154
<v Speaker 1>Turkey,</v>

290
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.320
<v Speaker 1>which is 14,000 years old.</v>

291
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:39.240
<v Speaker 1>It's so much earlier than Egypt</v>

292
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.560
<v Speaker 3>but not earlier than Africa in general.</v>

293
00:08:41.561 --> 00:08:42.940
<v Speaker 3>Like the out of Africa theory,</v>

294
00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:45.040
<v Speaker 3>right or happy</v>

295
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:50.050
<v Speaker 1>is right now the oldest known complex structure that a human has ever pilled and</v>

296
00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:54.500
<v Speaker 1>they know that it's at least 14,000 years old.</v>

297
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.510
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy.</v>

298
00:08:55.511 --> 00:08:56.311
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

299
00:08:56.311 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 1>they know that it existed for thousands of years before it was intentionally</v>

300
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>covered and they've only.</v>

301
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 1>I think as of right now,</v>

302
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:07.941
<v Speaker 1>they've only uncovered like five percent of the entire structure and it's</v>

303
00:09:08.251 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 1>enormous and there's a series of circles and stones,</v>

304
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:16.560
<v Speaker 1>but they've done whatever they do with radio waves or whatever they do to to map</v>

305
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:19.500
<v Speaker 1>out what's going on under the surface and they've determined that it's massive.</v>

306
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.693
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

307
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Fourteen thousand years ago,</v>

308
00:09:21.871 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 1>so that's even older than than Egypt,</v>

309
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.373
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

310
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

311
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.340
<v Speaker 1>You know that something was happening in Turkey before.</v>

312
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 1>It's something huge,</v>

313
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:32.000
<v Speaker 1>not just something he doesn't like.</v>

314
00:09:32.001 --> 00:09:36.330
<v Speaker 1>A 14 foot stone columns that had been caught and moved hundreds of tons of</v>

315
00:09:36.331 --> 00:09:37.140
<v Speaker 1>stone.</v>

316
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:37.321
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

317
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:38.154
<v Speaker 1>these are like,</v>

318
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.630
<v Speaker 1>this is advanced construction.</v>

319
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.460
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't dispel out of Africa though,</v>

320
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:41.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

321
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.900
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't necessarily.</v>

322
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:43.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

323
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

324
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.930
<v Speaker 1>because 14,000 years ago it's still ain't shit.</v>

325
00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.330
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about human beings coming out of Africa and migraines.</v>

326
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:50.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like millions.</v>

327
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

328
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

329
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.710
<v Speaker 1>what is a human,</v>

330
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

331
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:53.990
<v Speaker 1>it gets too low.</v>

332
00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Is it Jack Enemy?</v>

333
00:09:55.831 --> 00:09:56.131
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>

334
00:09:56.131 --> 00:09:56.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

335
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.980
<v Speaker 1>which different Australia pythagoreous like at what point in time do you decided</v>

336
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.770
<v Speaker 1>to early human because at one point in time it's like fucking the media and it</v>

337
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:09.030
<v Speaker 1>goes from Amoeba to being a lower primate and to being a higher primate.</v>

338
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.953
<v Speaker 1>When is that?</v>

339
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:11.063
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

340
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:13.670
<v Speaker 1>It's all how you frame it because the people,</v>

341
00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:13.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

342
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.520
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't want to hang out with Australia,</v>

343
00:10:15.521 --> 00:10:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Perth against the guy that's fucking idiots.</v>

344
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.600
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be a monkey man eating his own shit and fucking try to kill</v>

345
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:22.201
<v Speaker 1>your cat.</v>

346
00:10:22.201 --> 00:10:23.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's not a human.</v>

347
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:24.271
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

348
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:25.860
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like almost a human,</v>

349
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:26.880
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

350
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:31.880
<v Speaker 1>But I think I'm civilization in Mesopotamia was a looks super advanced.</v>

351
00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:38.931
<v Speaker 1>They know like 6,000 years ago in Turkey now being 14,000 years still,</v>

352
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:43.320
<v Speaker 1>I could go back to like 30,000 years and that ain't shit in terms of the history</v>

353
00:10:43.321 --> 00:10:47.730
<v Speaker 1>of the earth and that would be insane for us to think that 30,000 years ago they</v>

354
00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:49.260
<v Speaker 1>had like complex cities,</v>

355
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:50.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's super positive.</v>

356
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:50.850
<v Speaker 1>Yo,</v>

357
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:53.300
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to someone this week at Ted two.</v>

358
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.990
<v Speaker 1>She was a cosmologist and she was telling me that life can survive on Mars and</v>

359
00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.490
<v Speaker 1>then people you can actually,</v>

360
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.290
<v Speaker 1>if you're willing to commit,</v>

361
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.020
<v Speaker 1>they will take you to Mars and you can be part of the.</v>

362
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.670
<v Speaker 1>If someone was saying,</v>

363
00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

364
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I could put you on a space shuttle.</v>

365
00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:10.920
<v Speaker 1>You could go to Mars and you can be part of the first colony and you could</v>

366
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:13.290
<v Speaker 1>basically be the fucking gang gets kind of Mars.</v>

367
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:14.123
<v Speaker 1>Would you do it?</v>

368
00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:14.580
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

369
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.580
<v Speaker 1>it's stupid because Mars is just like a shitty apartment on earth.</v>

370
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:20.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's like.</v>

371
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like a shitty apartment that you can't get out of.</v>

372
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Once you get there,</v>

373
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.170
<v Speaker 1>that's where you're stuck.</v>

374
00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:26.740
<v Speaker 1>You can't go outside and there's no oxygen.</v>

375
00:11:26.741 --> 00:11:28.690
<v Speaker 1>You've got to terraform and put a dome over it.</v>

376
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.010
<v Speaker 1>Life can survive out there at night without that shit.</v>

377
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.510
<v Speaker 1>She's march of Mars.</v>

378
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Know that she believes can sustain life.</v>

379
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

380
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.033
<v Speaker 1>she's silly.</v>

381
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:38.970
<v Speaker 1>That's not correct.</v>

382
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.140
<v Speaker 1>But hypothetic mean.</v>

383
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't say it's correct.</v>

384
00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

385
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:41.881
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

386
00:11:41.881 --> 00:11:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Hypothetically you,</v>

387
00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:43.890
<v Speaker 1>let's say it was correct,</v>

388
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.450
<v Speaker 1>let's say who it was,</v>

389
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.440
<v Speaker 1>but it would have to be a very small area because most of Mars doesn't have.</v>

390
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that the,</v>

391
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:51.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

392
00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.460
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere would vary that much with one part would be sustainable,</v>

393
00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:55.780
<v Speaker 2>so alien to me?</v>

394
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

395
00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:57.680
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't talking about terraforming.</v>

396
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.090
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

397
00:11:58.090 --> 00:11:58.923
<v Speaker 2>she was talking about,</v>

398
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.200
<v Speaker 2>she said life can sustain on Morris.</v>

399
00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.800
<v Speaker 2>She was telling me but as it is.</v>

400
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.030
<v Speaker 2>And then she showed me a media.</v>

401
00:12:04.031 --> 00:12:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

402
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:04.961
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

403
00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:05.730
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

404
00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I kind of got fucked up by the show and tell because they're short sell,</v>

405
00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.820
<v Speaker 2>kind of fucking threw me off.</v>

406
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:10.181
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

407
00:12:10.181 --> 00:12:10.391
<v Speaker 2>Damn,</v>

408
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 2>you got a rock from there.</v>

409
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Terraforming means when you go to,</v>

410
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:14.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

411
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.760
<v Speaker 2>a inhospitable climate and set up machines to click in the movie alien,</v>

412
00:12:18.761 --> 00:12:19.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

413
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

414
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how there's any other way to live on Mars.</v>

415
00:12:22.391 --> 00:12:22.841
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

416
00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:24.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that atmosphere is thick enough.</v>

417
00:12:24.541 --> 00:12:27.770
<v Speaker 2>That would be scary if those machines broke one day or something.</v>

418
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Everyone died at once and died.</v>

419
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Slovis fixation.</v>

420
00:12:32.291 --> 00:12:34.630
<v Speaker 2>When this air slowly gets eaten up by,</v>

421
00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:35.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

422
00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.050
<v Speaker 2>if someone told me you could go to Mars and there's everything you need and it's</v>

423
00:12:38.051 --> 00:12:40.510
<v Speaker 2>terraforming and con Ed was in charge,</v>

424
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:41.590
<v Speaker 2>I would never fucking go.</v>

425
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:42.341
<v Speaker 2>Listen man.</v>

426
00:12:42.341 --> 00:12:44.350
<v Speaker 2>Even if he will have con ed in La Obviously,</v>

427
00:12:44.351 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 2>but in New York kind of fucks everything up.</v>

428
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:48.980
<v Speaker 2>We have the same thing.</v>

429
00:12:48.981 --> 00:12:49.814
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

430
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:51.510
<v Speaker 2>I don't even fuck shit up.</v>

431
00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Fucking who fucks it up,</v>

432
00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.380
<v Speaker 2>your electricity.</v>

433
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.910
<v Speaker 2>The other function of Edison,</v>

434
00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:55.823
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

435
00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:01.180
<v Speaker 2>La was famous for the brownouts back in the day where they just started shutting</v>

436
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:02.980
<v Speaker 2>power up and basically they didn't have to do it.</v>

437
00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:03.540
<v Speaker 2>They were doing.</v>

438
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:04.371
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

439
00:13:04.371 --> 00:13:05.620
<v Speaker 2>It was all agreed thing.</v>

440
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:06.491
<v Speaker 2>Somehow or another,</v>

441
00:13:06.491 --> 00:13:06.941
<v Speaker 2>it was a.</v>

442
00:13:06.941 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 2>They were making a fuck load of money doing that.</v>

443
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:09.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what the scam was,</v>

444
00:13:09.881 --> 00:13:13.780
<v Speaker 2>but people I believe lost their job and even went to jail for that shit.</v>

445
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Those brownouts yeah,</v>

446
00:13:16.151 --> 00:13:16.360
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

447
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:16.961
<v Speaker 2>but Mars.</v>

448
00:13:16.961 --> 00:13:18.150
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking that,</v>

449
00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:18.581
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

450
00:13:18.581 --> 00:13:19.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go to my.</v>

451
00:13:19.641 --> 00:13:20.920
<v Speaker 2>She said you can go,</v>

452
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.090
<v Speaker 2>but you can never come back.</v>

453
00:13:22.091 --> 00:13:22.660
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

454
00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:22.901
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

455
00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:23.734
<v Speaker 2>let me ask you this.</v>

456
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Would you go to the desert?</v>

457
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Would you go to the middle of the Sahara where there ain't shit.</v>

458
00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.010
<v Speaker 2>It's dangerous and you could die out there for no reason but never to stay</v>

459
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:33.844
<v Speaker 2>forever,</v>

460
00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:34.853
<v Speaker 2>but that's Mars.</v>

461
00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.480
<v Speaker 2>Mars is just like going out into the mojave.</v>

462
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 2>Ain't shit out there.</v>

463
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.181
<v Speaker 2>What she said though,</v>

464
00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:45.181
<v Speaker 2>she said mad people from her classes and the other professor she knows wanted to</v>

465
00:13:45.581 --> 00:13:45.881
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

466
00:13:45.881 --> 00:13:49.030
<v Speaker 2>They were all wanting to sign up to go to Mars and you got to be egotistical</v>

467
00:13:49.031 --> 00:13:50.560
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker to be like,</v>

468
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I want it to be the first one on this bullshit planet.</v>

469
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:53.261
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

470
00:13:53.261 --> 00:13:54.220
<v Speaker 2>some people are silly.</v>

471
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.670
<v Speaker 2>That's a silly thing to do to go to another planet where you can't get back.</v>

472
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

473
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.600
<v Speaker 2>Especially if like lance bass is going,</v>

474
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.500
<v Speaker 2>isn't he the one that's out in space and shit,</v>

475
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:04.890
<v Speaker 2>the backstreet boys or instinct dude in space is,</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

477

<v Speaker 2>is he out in space?</v>

478
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.023
<v Speaker 2>He's trying.</v>

479
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.100
<v Speaker 2>One of the first ones he was.</v>

480
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:09.341
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

487
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:14.801
<v Speaker 2>if they were like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

495
00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm just saying I think you're onto something better than you know,</v>

496
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.360
<v Speaker 2>going by yourself.</v>

497

503
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.630
<v Speaker 2>He's like the White Lloyd from entourage.</v>

504
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.750
<v Speaker 2>I ever watched the same here.</v>

505
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.160
<v Speaker 2>It was a horrible show.</v>

506
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.790
<v Speaker 2>I only watched it.</v>

507
00:14:46.791 --> 00:14:47.880
<v Speaker 2>What happened to the Asian?</v>

508
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.710
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if it was a fair representative of the show.</v>

509
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:52.050
<v Speaker 2>I only it once and I was like,</v>

510
00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.270
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck's going on here?</v>

511
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:54.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

512
00:14:54.541 --> 00:14:54.770
<v Speaker 1>who?</v>

513
00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:55.603
<v Speaker 1>What are they watching?</v>

514
00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:55.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

515
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.890
<v Speaker 3>isn't the Asian gay?</v>

516
00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.030
<v Speaker 3>He was mad gay.</v>

517
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.353
<v Speaker 3>A lot of.</v>

518
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

519
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:04.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

520
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Would you go to Mars?</v>

521
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:06.951
<v Speaker 1>Would you?</v>

522
00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:07.460
<v Speaker 1>If you could,</v>

523
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.840
<v Speaker 1>if you knew it was dope.</v>

524
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:11.000
<v Speaker 1>If you knew it was like Alaska in the summer,</v>

525
00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.530
<v Speaker 1>just beautiful green</v>

526
00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.890
<v Speaker 3>like they have the Bush company.</v>

527
00:15:13.891 --> 00:15:14.724
<v Speaker 3>I would go,</v>

528
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:15.430
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

529
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.710
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

530
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.370
<v Speaker 3>If I could go to Mars and come back.</v>

531
00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:19.150
<v Speaker 1>If you could go and come back,</v>

532
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.411
<v Speaker 1>go and come back.</v>

533
00:15:20.411 --> 00:15:22.510
<v Speaker 1>But it was only a 90 percent chance of success.</v>

534
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Success meaning like life life coming back like 10 percent possibility that</v>

535
00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:32.140
<v Speaker 1>there might be a fucking solar flare while you're in the middle of the flight</v>

536
00:15:32.141 --> 00:15:33.130
<v Speaker 1>back and everybody in the</v>

537
00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.203
<v Speaker 3>playing guitar.</v>

538
00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.120
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't need a 100 percent like I'm not.</v>

539
00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm not dude that I won't even get laser eye surgery.</v>

540
00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:40.780
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>

541
00:15:40.781 --> 00:15:42.760
<v Speaker 3>Like my brothers all got laser eye surgery.</v>

542
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.450
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

543
00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.141
<v Speaker 3>you Chinese,</v>

544
00:15:44.141 --> 00:15:45.590
<v Speaker 3>you should not be fucking with your eyes.</v>

545
00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.110
<v Speaker 3>You already fucked up and now you're going to introduce this new element of</v>

546
00:15:50.111 --> 00:15:50.650
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>

547
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.483
<v Speaker 3>Hell No.</v>

548
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Well they're supposedly had it down pretty good.</v>

549
00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.360
<v Speaker 1>At what level will you be willing to do it?</v>

550
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Like 200 percent.</v>

551
00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:58.791
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred percent.</v>

552
00:15:58.791 --> 00:15:59.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

553
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's how could they do?</v>

554
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:03.650
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

555
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:05.810
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't need to be 100 percent that 100 percent back</v>

556
00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.080
<v Speaker 1>a hundred percent.</v>

557
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:09.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

558
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.130
<v Speaker 1>come from New York to La.</v>

559
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:12.061
<v Speaker 1>You might as well.</v>

560
00:16:12.061 --> 00:16:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

561
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.180
<v Speaker 1>if it was at 97 percent,</v>

562
00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:15.810
<v Speaker 1>I will go.</v>

563
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.330
<v Speaker 1>I'll deal with a three percent plus minus.</v>

564
00:16:18.331 --> 00:16:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that if people keep going the way we're going now and a thousand</v>

565
00:16:21.811 --> 00:16:24.660
<v Speaker 1>years from now getting to Mars will be just like going to New York.</v>

566
00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:25.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

567
00:16:25.471 --> 00:16:26.131
<v Speaker 1>that would be awesome.</v>

568
00:16:26.131 --> 00:16:28.470
<v Speaker 1>If we don't blow each other up in a thousand years,</v>

569
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.320
<v Speaker 1>just imagine what we've done in 200 years and a thousand years.</v>

570
00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:32.820
<v Speaker 1>There'll be plane flights tomorrow.</v>

571
00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.580
<v Speaker 1>It'll be so fast.</v>

572
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Like five hours later you're on Mars.</v>

573
00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.960
<v Speaker 1>Did you say your present was seven percent?</v>

574
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.770
<v Speaker 1>90 seven.</v>

575
00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:40.951
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

576
00:16:40.951 --> 00:16:41.400
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

577
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

578
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I would love to go.</v>

579
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:44.453
<v Speaker 1>I would love to go.</v>

580
00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.530
<v Speaker 1>I just want to see that shit.</v>

581
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

582
00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:51.060
<v Speaker 1>if you had a choice between going to another planet or going back in time,</v>

583
00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:52.643
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

584
00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.180
<v Speaker 1>that's a good call because going back in time you kind of know what you could</v>

585
00:16:57.181 --> 00:16:58.014
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

586
00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.820
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

587
00:16:59.821 --> 00:17:01.530
<v Speaker 1>going back in time,</v>

588
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:04.060
<v Speaker 3>I would probably,</v>

589
00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:04.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

590
00:17:04.721 --> 00:17:06.820
<v Speaker 3>I would want to go to Mars because going back in time,</v>

591
00:17:06.821 --> 00:17:07.930
<v Speaker 3>the other times we've had,</v>

592
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:09.760
<v Speaker 3>it's like less amenable.</v>

593
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:10.661
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>

594
00:17:10.661 --> 00:17:12.400
<v Speaker 3>Like there's more diseases.</v>

595
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:14.260
<v Speaker 3>You don't get killed as easily.</v>

596
00:17:14.261 --> 00:17:16.900
<v Speaker 3>Like you get shanked you know when you die back in the day,</v>

597
00:17:16.901 --> 00:17:17.734
<v Speaker 3>you get shanked.</v>

598
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.810
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a bullet in the head.</v>

599
00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:20.680
<v Speaker 3>You could die easily.</v>

600
00:17:20.681 --> 00:17:25.600
<v Speaker 3>Now I would rather go to the future then go backwards for safety sake.</v>

601
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.580
<v Speaker 3>Not just safety sake,</v>

602
00:17:27.581 --> 00:17:29.020
<v Speaker 3>but I want to see the next shit.</v>

603
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.253
<v Speaker 3>There's not really,</v>

604
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:34.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like woody Allen where there's a period of time I would love to Tony's</v>

605
00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:35.123
<v Speaker 3>parents,</v>

606
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.193
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

607
00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.120
<v Speaker 3>would love to be alone to 30 to tell you,</v>

608
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:39.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

609
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.900
<v Speaker 3>like hell no man,</v>

610
00:17:40.901 --> 00:17:42.790
<v Speaker 3>like motherfuckers didn't have ac.</v>

611
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.160
<v Speaker 3>A few.</v>

612
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.900
<v Speaker 1>I would way rather see the future,</v>

613
00:17:45.901 --> 00:17:47.040
<v Speaker 1>like a peek at the future.</v>

614
00:17:47.041 --> 00:17:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Then a peak at the past,</v>

615
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.330
<v Speaker 1>but if it had,</v>

616
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:52.030
<v Speaker 1>if I had to choose between going to Mars or going to the past,</v>

617
00:17:52.031 --> 00:17:52.811
<v Speaker 1>I think the past,</v>

618
00:17:52.811 --> 00:17:53.620
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt,</v>

619
00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.260
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see how people lived thousands of years ago.</v>

620
00:17:56.261 --> 00:17:56.561
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the story of the,</v>

668
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.850
<v Speaker 1>of the Mongols and how much they accomplished and they took over countries and</v>

669
00:19:42.851 --> 00:19:47.851
<v Speaker 1>then they would force the people in that country to go with them to war and they</v>

670
00:19:47.861 --> 00:19:52.660
<v Speaker 1>would become soldiers like they would invade Poland and steel Polish people.</v>

671
00:19:52.661 --> 00:19:55.510
<v Speaker 1>They made French people fight against other Europeans.</v>

680
00:20:05.651 --> 00:20:07.300
<v Speaker 1>They incorporate them into their army.</v>

681
00:20:07.301 --> 00:20:09.970

686
00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:21.791

<v Speaker 1>You couldn't be that mean.</v>

724
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Why are we torturing everybody?</v>

725
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.330
<v Speaker 1>But that's so much pussy too.</v>

726
00:21:27.331 --> 00:21:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was tons of pussy.</v>

727
00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Well it was,</v>

728
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:30.790
<v Speaker 1>it was constant.</v>

729
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.070
<v Speaker 1>It was constant pussy.</v>

730
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

731
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

732
00:21:32.981 --> 00:21:35.110
<v Speaker 1>They would steal each other's wives and shit.</v>

733
00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:35.681
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>

734
00:21:35.681 --> 00:21:37.450
<v Speaker 1>like dudes were just,</v>

735
00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.350
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

736
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.160
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>

737
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:40.900
<v Speaker 1>chimps with swords,</v>

738
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:41.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

739
00:21:41.351 --> 00:21:44.410
<v Speaker 1>that's what human beings for like if you could give champs a bunch of swords,</v>

740
00:21:44.411 --> 00:21:45.970
<v Speaker 1>they would do terrible,</v>

741
00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:46.990
<v Speaker 1>horrible shit.</v>

742
00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:47.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

743
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:51.220
<v Speaker 1>we don't think about human beings as being capable of doing terrible,</v>

744
00:21:51.221 --> 00:21:51.801
<v Speaker 1>horrible shit.</v>

745
00:21:51.801 --> 00:21:53.350
<v Speaker 1>But even today,</v>

746
00:21:53.351 --> 00:21:55.930
<v Speaker 1>if you look at some of the accounts of what's going on in North Korea,</v>

747
00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.060
<v Speaker 1>those North Korea and Syria,</v>

748
00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:58.841
<v Speaker 1>Syria,</v>

749
00:21:58.841 --> 00:21:59.250
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

750
00:21:59.250 --> 00:21:59.591
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

751
00:21:59.591 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 1>it's bad.</v>

752
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.680
<v Speaker 1>There's parts of the world ever.</v>

753
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:06.100
<v Speaker 1>There's always going to be parts of the world where it's terrible and people are</v>

754
00:22:06.101 --> 00:22:09.400
<v Speaker 1>capable in those parts of the world of doing shit that you only read about in</v>

755
00:22:09.401 --> 00:22:10.234
<v Speaker 1>history books.</v>

756
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Rodman going to North Korea.</v>

757
00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:13.690
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>

758
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

759
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.711
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted that today.</v>

760
00:22:14.711 --> 00:22:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Is he out of his fucking mind out or no man,</v>

761
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.030
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to like him in North Korea.</v>

762
00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he understands what North Korea is.</v>

763
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.320
<v Speaker 1>He's going over there to do some sort of a Harlem Grope.</v>

764
00:22:23.321 --> 00:22:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Globe trotters style.</v>

765
00:22:24.191 --> 00:22:24.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

766
00:22:24.611 --> 00:22:25.301
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

767
00:22:25.301 --> 00:22:25.720
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

768
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Americans can't really wrap their head around how fucked up</v>

769
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:33.010
<v Speaker 1>it's fucked up so far.</v>

770
00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:33.970
<v Speaker 1>It's Nazi Germany.</v>

771
00:22:33.971 --> 00:22:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

772
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:35.303
<v Speaker 1>Just like.</v>

773
00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.310
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say that you're walking into like there's country.</v>

774
00:22:39.311 --> 00:22:40.091
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

775
00:22:40.091 --> 00:22:41.170
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

776
00:22:41.171 --> 00:22:42.190
<v Speaker 1>The whole country.</v>

777
00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Anyone want to leave the kill at the board?</v>

778
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

779
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.480
<v Speaker 1>And there's so many slaves.</v>

780
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.990
<v Speaker 1>They have so many slaves and they have these slave colonies where they're making</v>

781
00:22:49.991 --> 00:22:53.200
<v Speaker 1>these people work for like a half a bowl of rice a day.</v>

782
00:22:53.201 --> 00:22:54.490
<v Speaker 1>They're starving to death.</v>

783
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.710
<v Speaker 1>They keep them just barely above starving that.</v>

784
00:22:56.711 --> 00:22:58.390
<v Speaker 1>They beat them to death constantly.</v>

785
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.040
<v Speaker 1>They feed them to dogs.</v>

786
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Like people that have escaped have told stories.</v>

787
00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:06.640
<v Speaker 1>There's the human rights violations that we're hearing from North Korea,</v>

788
00:23:06.641 --> 00:23:06.820
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

789
00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:07.061
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

790
00:23:07.061 --> 00:23:11.230
<v Speaker 1>that shit about going to Iraq because we're going over there to fucking protect</v>

791
00:23:11.231 --> 00:23:13.060
<v Speaker 1>lives and enforce democracy.</v>

792
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.400
<v Speaker 1>If we really wanted to protect lives,</v>

793
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.260
<v Speaker 1>we would be in North Korea right now.</v>

794
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.130
<v Speaker 1>It will be North Korea.</v>

795
00:23:18.131 --> 00:23:18.880
<v Speaker 1>We'd be in Syria.</v>

796
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

797
00:23:19.271 --> 00:23:19.780
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

798
00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Those that don't that place,</v>

799
00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:22.300
<v Speaker 1>especially North Korea,</v>

800
00:23:22.301 --> 00:23:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm more familiar with that than I am with what's going on in Syria,</v>

801
00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:27.640
<v Speaker 1>but North Korea is a mess right now.</v>

802
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

803
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.121
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

804
00:23:28.121 --> 00:23:28.841
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

805
00:23:28.841 --> 00:23:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Our our country is not a country that's out there benevolently in country.</v>

806
00:23:33.611 --> 00:23:37.360
<v Speaker 1>It's just really to protect the business interests at hand and I'm like,</v>

807
00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.640
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things like,</v>

808
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

809
00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.210
<v Speaker 1>which movie did you want to win?</v>

810
00:23:40.211 --> 00:23:40.840
<v Speaker 1>The Oscar.</v>

811
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:41.673
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious.</v>

812
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck about.</v>

813
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:48.170
<v Speaker 1>I think that awards for art or some of the dumbest is to judge the judge are.</v>

814
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested though,</v>

815
00:23:50.001 --> 00:23:50.720
<v Speaker 1>just because I'm like,</v>

816
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:50.901
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

817
00:23:50.901 --> 00:23:52.130
<v Speaker 1>they pick the right one this year.</v>

818
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:52.791
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what I mean?</v>

819
00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:55.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm really curious to see if one day they'll do the right thing because I was</v>

820
00:23:55.371 --> 00:23:55.670
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

821
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Django was the best shit out.</v>

822
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.150
<v Speaker 1>A Django was the hardest movie out this year.</v>

823
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.013
<v Speaker 1>It should have won.</v>

824
00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.160
<v Speaker 1>That was a great movie.</v>

825
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.510
<v Speaker 1>He goes three hours and never lost my intention.</v>

826
00:24:03.511 --> 00:24:06.500
<v Speaker 1>I know that movie kept me going the whole time to do argo.</v>

827
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:06.741
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

828
00:24:06.741 --> 00:24:08.770
<v Speaker 1>You just basically recreating some shit that happened.</v>

829
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:12.290
<v Speaker 1>You're a to see both of those movies.</v>

830
00:24:12.291 --> 00:24:15.500
<v Speaker 1>The problem with those movies is they're based on real events and they add a</v>

831
00:24:15.501 --> 00:24:17.040
<v Speaker 1>bunch of bullshit and it's not real.</v>

832
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.980
<v Speaker 1>They add a bunch of bullshit to them and when you add a bunch of bullshit like,</v>

833
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:25.460
<v Speaker 1>like the woman that was responsible for everything and zero dark 30 that made</v>

834
00:24:25.461 --> 00:24:26.211
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing happened,</v>

835
00:24:26.211 --> 00:24:26.930
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go kill him.</v>

836
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:27.320
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

837
00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.370
<v Speaker 1>that bitch didn't exist.</v>

838
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:28.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

839
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:29.600
<v Speaker 1>she's not a real human.</v>

840
00:24:29.601 --> 00:24:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

841
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.020
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that.</v>

842
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't just add people to historical movies.</v>

843
00:24:34.701 --> 00:24:35.470
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

844
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Unless if someone was going to find in Latin,</v>

845
00:24:37.251 --> 00:24:38.120
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be a ginger.</v>

846
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.550
<v Speaker 1>It might be the good decks.</v>

847
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

848
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:45.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

849
00:24:45.681 --> 00:24:45.970
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

850
00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:47.480
<v Speaker 1>the lady was a great actor.</v>

851
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:49.250
<v Speaker 1>The movie was very well done,</v>

852
00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.780
<v Speaker 1>but I call shenanigans.</v>

853
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:54.470
<v Speaker 1>You can't just create a fucking fictional character that figures it all out and</v>

854
00:24:54.471 --> 00:24:55.790
<v Speaker 1>there was no George Bush like,</v>

855
00:24:55.791 --> 00:24:57.860
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do the whole fucking movie with no dumb ass.</v>

856
00:24:57.861 --> 00:24:59.080
<v Speaker 1>George fucking it up.</v>

857
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.440
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was weird.</v>

858
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:01.191
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>

859
00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:02.150
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird movie,</v>

860
00:25:02.151 --> 00:25:02.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

861
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:03.770
<v Speaker 1>It was a very weird movie,</v>

862
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.050
<v Speaker 1>but I remember watching jangled.</v>

863
00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

864
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:06.920
<v Speaker 1>if this shit doesn't win the Oscars,</v>

865
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:07.800
<v Speaker 1>it's bullshit.</v>

866
00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:08.800
<v Speaker 1>The Oscars is.</v>

867
00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.770
<v Speaker 1>It is every year.</v>

868
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:10.663
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

869
00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.950
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

870
00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.850
<v Speaker 1>The titanic was not a good movie.</v>

871
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:16.460
<v Speaker 1>Not a good movie.</v>

872
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.423
<v Speaker 1>It was good.</v>

873
00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.720
<v Speaker 1>That was good about titanic.</v>

874
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Special effects were fucking incredible.</v>

875
00:25:22.761 --> 00:25:23.481
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing.</v>

876
00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:27.740
<v Speaker 1>It was a vehicle for showing what's possible cinematically with special effects</v>

877
00:25:27.741 --> 00:25:29.270
<v Speaker 1>in 19 whatever the fuck it was.</v>

878
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:30.920
<v Speaker 1>90 something to hear you talk about it,</v>

879
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.560
<v Speaker 1>but as far as like a script,</v>

880
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like really obvious,</v>

881
00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

882
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:37.070
<v Speaker 1>it was hot trash,</v>

883
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:38.780
<v Speaker 1>more obvious than Avatar.</v>

884
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Avatar was knocked for being obvious,</v>

885
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:44.510
<v Speaker 1>but I thought Avatar was even more creative with like the crazy plants that you</v>

886
00:25:44.511 --> 00:25:45.440
<v Speaker 1>can plug into.</v>

887
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:47.420
<v Speaker 1>The screenplay was slightly better,</v>

888
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:48.531
<v Speaker 1>slightly better,</v>

889
00:25:48.531 --> 00:25:51.680
<v Speaker 1>and also avatar was actually like in terms of special effects,</v>

890
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.030
<v Speaker 1>even more progressive,</v>

891
00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.130
<v Speaker 1>even more avatar was on some shit.</v>

892
00:25:55.131 --> 00:25:57.380
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like what Cameron's movies are.</v>

893
00:25:57.381 --> 00:25:58.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're like,</v>

894
00:25:58.251 --> 00:26:02.360
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't stray too far from the path when it comes to like a storyline,</v>

895
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.730
<v Speaker 1>but he provides you with the state of the art shit.</v>

896
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.860
<v Speaker 1>He takes the bar and just just blows it through the stratosphere.</v>

897
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.290
<v Speaker 1>No one came close to avatar yet.</v>

898
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Then movie's insane.</v>

899
00:26:14.091 --> 00:26:15.470
<v Speaker 1>The visual experience,</v>

900
00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.050
<v Speaker 1>especially if you go to imax three,</v>

901
00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.830
<v Speaker 1>a motherfucker,</v>

902
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.400
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

903
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.610
<v Speaker 1>just one of those dudes were popping out of their little sleep tanks and</v>

904
00:26:22.611 --> 00:26:23.990
<v Speaker 1>floating through the air and you're like,</v>

905
00:26:23.991 --> 00:26:24.410
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

906
00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:25.740
<v Speaker 1>this movie is bad has.</v>

907
00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

908
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.730
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I saw up in,</v>

909
00:26:27.731 --> 00:26:30.650
<v Speaker 1>it was in three d and I was like this the worst use of three d ever.</v>

910
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.600
<v Speaker 1>Like it just made the Asian Kid Chubbier</v>

911
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:34.791
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

912
00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 1>there's some movies that don't really do a good job with it.</v>

913
00:26:37.311 --> 00:26:39.500
<v Speaker 1>But avatar was stunning.</v>

914
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:40.350
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>

915
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:41.870
<v Speaker 1>It was more than just a movie.</v>

916
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:42.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

917
00:26:42.141 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 1>two best movies this year was fucking Django</v>

918
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.341
<v Speaker 3>and wreck it.</v>

919
00:26:44.341 --> 00:26:45.540
<v Speaker 3>Ralph wreck it.</v>

920
00:26:45.541 --> 00:26:46.840
<v Speaker 3>Ralph was making movies.</v>

921
00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:49.630
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know what you're talking about.</v>

922
00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.473
<v Speaker 3>You got to watch.</v>

924
00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:51.501
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

925
00:26:51.501 --> 00:26:55.290
<v Speaker 3>you will never have all your favorite characters from fucking video games in a</v>

928
00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.390

929
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:02.431
<v Speaker 3>This was,</v>

930

<v Speaker 3>Who are we talking to recently?</v>

970
00:27:46.901 --> 00:27:48.310
<v Speaker 3>They never heard of grizzly man and</v>

971
00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:48.870
<v Speaker 2>we're like,</v>

972
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:49.703
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

973
00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:51.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

974
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:52.500
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard of the documentary?</v>

975
00:27:52.501 --> 00:27:52.831
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

976
00:27:52.831 --> 00:27:53.190

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.250
<v Speaker 2>But I'm also Chinese.</v>

980
00:27:56.251 --> 00:27:59.370
<v Speaker 2>One was this grizzly man fairly recently.</v>

981
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.190
<v Speaker 2>I kind of missed cultural thing six years ago.</v>

982
00:28:02.191 --> 00:28:03.450
<v Speaker 2>Maybe something like that.</v>

983
00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:08.630
<v Speaker 2>You usually man is a movie about a dude who lived bears.</v>

984
00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Bears.</v>

985
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:10.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

986
00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:11.400
<v Speaker 2>People told me about this,</v>

987
00:28:11.401 --> 00:28:11.850
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>

988
00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:12.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested.</v>

989
00:28:12.721 --> 00:28:13.950
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't in the world journal.</v>

990
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:18.450
<v Speaker 2>Do you need a smoke a joint and watch this and laugh by bear.</v>

991
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Laugh your dick off at this silly,</v>

992
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:22.973
<v Speaker 2>silly bitch.</v>

993
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:27.060
<v Speaker 2>This guy might be the silliest bitch to ever go camping and yeah,</v>

994
00:28:27.061 --> 00:28:28.320
<v Speaker 2>it was crazy and the bear ate him.</v>

995
00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.183
<v Speaker 2>The end of the movie.</v>

996
00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:29.580
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

997
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a fascinating.</v>

998
00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:33.030
<v Speaker 2>It's because it's not meant to be funny.</v>

999
00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a Werner Herzog film.</v>

1000
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.911
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1001
00:28:34.911 --> 00:28:35.250
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1002
00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not meant to be funny,</v>

1003
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:37.230
<v Speaker 2>but it's just funny.</v>

1004
00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:37.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

1005
00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:38.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1006
00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.950
<v Speaker 2>like the Perfect Cohen brothers movie.</v>

1007
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.630
<v Speaker 2>You know how like Coen brothers movies.</v>

1008
00:28:42.631 --> 00:28:44.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like dark and exit.</v>

1009
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:44.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1010
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.091
<v Speaker 2>accidentally.</v>

1011
00:28:45.091 --> 00:28:45.391
<v Speaker 2>Funny.</v>

1012
00:28:45.391 --> 00:28:45.841
<v Speaker 2>Almost.</v>

1013
00:28:45.841 --> 00:28:46.370
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1014
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:50.090
<v Speaker 2>like Fargo Fargo's amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I didn't even understand Fargo till I was 20.</v>

1018
00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.070
<v Speaker 2>When you're younger and watching,</v>

00:28:55.071 --> 00:28:55.904
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>What you get used to people being bullshit artists.</v>

1025
00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:14.070
<v Speaker 2>That's when the salesman and his fucking coat become so much more entertaining.</v>

1026
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:17.820
<v Speaker 2>When you run into like one of those bullshit salesmen is just trying so hard to</v>

1027
00:29:17.821 --> 00:29:21.360
<v Speaker 2>sell you this fucking bullshit that you spray on the bottom of your car.</v>

1028
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.790

<v Speaker 2>You want to see him die.</v>

1030
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:26.850
<v Speaker 2>It's so unfortunate.</v>

1031
00:29:26.851 --> 00:29:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

1032

<v Speaker 2>Not all of them.</v>

1033

1034
00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Just a useless Fox clogging it up for everybody else.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I do believe I've seen that.</v>

1078
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:50.640
<v Speaker 2>Another way to think about it,</v>

1079
00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:55.830
<v Speaker 2>I think I have with the little girl and the big cat and the faces and stuff.</v>

1080
00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:56.693
<v Speaker 2>It's really cool.</v>

1081
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1083
00:30:57.631 --> 00:30:58.530
<v Speaker 2>I do think I've seen that.</v>

1084
00:30:58.531 --> 00:30:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Is that yours?</v>

1085
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.520
<v Speaker 2>That's what of always.</v>

1086
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:01.360
<v Speaker 2>That's one of my eye.</v>

1087
00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:04.230
<v Speaker 2>I have movies I can watch over and over and over again.</v>

1088
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.210
<v Speaker 2>That's one of them,</v>

1089
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.660
<v Speaker 2>like that's relaxing,</v>

1090
00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:06.971
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1091
00:31:06.971 --> 00:31:07.290
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

1092
00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:10.110
<v Speaker 2>It can get annoying because it's so relaxing and calm and cool.</v>

1093
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Know that's the opposite of grizzly man.</v>

1094
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:15.300
<v Speaker 2>I thought Toronto was pretty cool to the neutron.</v>

1095
00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:15.961
<v Speaker 2>Did you really?</v>

1096
00:31:15.961 --> 00:31:16.800
<v Speaker 2>You would recommend that?</v>

1097
00:31:16.801 --> 00:31:17.730
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't recommend it,</v>

1098
00:31:17.731 --> 00:31:19.080
<v Speaker 2>but I think that year I might've been.</v>

1099
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.390
<v Speaker 2>That would have been in my handful of movies.</v>

1100
00:31:21.391 --> 00:31:22.740
<v Speaker 2>I just thought it was trippy to watch.</v>

1101
00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:23.021
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1102
00:31:23.021 --> 00:31:25.290
<v Speaker 2>I think to use like it represented,</v>

1103
00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:25.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1104
00:31:25.651 --> 00:31:26.610
<v Speaker 2>the old day,</v>

1105
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.520
<v Speaker 2>the old fan,</v>

1106
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:29.910
<v Speaker 2>if you're a fan,</v>

1107
00:31:29.911 --> 00:31:30.541
<v Speaker 2>I can see it,</v>

1108
00:31:30.541 --> 00:31:31.560
<v Speaker 2>but it was a piece of shit.</v>

1109
00:31:31.770 --> 00:31:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1110
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.001
<v Speaker 2>it was good to watch.</v>

1111
00:31:33.001 --> 00:31:35.130
<v Speaker 2>The special effects were weird.</v>

1112
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:36.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like it was so obvious.</v>

1113
00:31:36.301 --> 00:31:37.860
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't really a young him.</v>

1114
00:31:37.861 --> 00:31:40.620
<v Speaker 2>It was like they did something to his face and turn them into young adults.</v>

1115
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:41.291
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1116
00:31:41.291 --> 00:31:44.680
<v Speaker 5>I guess the one film I recommend that everyone is killa season.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He just looked weird.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean routine traffic stop.</v>

1197
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:21.450

1198
00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:25.620
<v Speaker 1>they detected the smell of marijuana and that's where they,</v>

1199
00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.190
<v Speaker 1>that's where they got them and they brought him in because they smelled</v>

<v Speaker 2>I've had to go try.</v>

1309
00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Always try.</v>

1310
00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.420

1311
00:37:19.421 --> 00:37:20.290
<v Speaker 2>we never let it happen.</v>

1312
00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:20.561
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

00:37:22.841 --> 00:37:23.431
<v Speaker 2>That tickles.</v>

1319
00:37:23.431 --> 00:37:24.310
<v Speaker 2>It makes me feel gross.</v>

1320
00:37:24.311 --> 00:37:28.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the people that believe or subscribe into the thing that,</v>

1321
00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:28.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.120
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to look at it.</v>

1324
00:37:31.121 --> 00:37:31.990
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to see it.</v>

1325
00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:33.243
<v Speaker 2>Smell it.</v>

1326
00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:33.701
<v Speaker 2>Touch it.</v>

1327
00:37:33.701 --> 00:37:35.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anything around my ass.</v>

1328
00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:37.183
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why.</v>

1329
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.841
<v Speaker 2>Hey Man.</v>

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.753
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>

1332
00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:40.870
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a mess.</v>

1333
00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:41.351
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1334
00:37:41.351 --> 00:37:42.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't see</v>

1335
00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.070
<v Speaker 1>like grooming.</v>

1336
00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:46.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't see you getting down there with a fucking mirror.</v>

1337
00:37:46.441 --> 00:37:46.990
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1338
00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:48.350
<v Speaker 1>a big three blade.</v>

1339
00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.540
<v Speaker 2>Who has time for that?</v>

1340
00:37:49.541 --> 00:37:51.370
<v Speaker 2>Joe Polish and that area up nice.</v>

1341
00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Cleaning it up a company.</v>

1342
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:55.390
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1343
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:55.751
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1344
00:37:55.751 --> 00:37:56.440
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile</v>

1345
00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.600
<v Speaker 1>girls go in 69 and you her eyeball.</v>

1346
00:37:58.601 --> 00:38:03.370
<v Speaker 1>So like fucking inches away from that dirty disaster of an asshole of yours.</v>

1347
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Do you let girls eat your ass?</v>

1348
00:38:04.841 --> 00:38:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever.</v>

1349
00:38:06.671 --> 00:38:07.350
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever had.</v>

1350
00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:08.180
<v Speaker 2>Never had that</v>

1351
00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:08.400
<v Speaker 1>have?</v>

1352
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I've had girls get to the balls and the taint,</v>

1353
00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:14.590
<v Speaker 1>but I've never had a girl that nom nom nom</v>

1354
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:15.543
<v Speaker 2>my ass.</v>

1355
00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.430
<v Speaker 2>And you get asked.</v>

1356
00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:19.060
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it in porn.</v>

1357
00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:19.450
<v Speaker 2>I've seen.</v>

1358
00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1359
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:24.210
<v Speaker 1>corn I've looked at certain things we can't discuss in this program with</v>

1360
00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:25.800
<v Speaker 1>websites is one of them.</v>

1361
00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.401
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1362
00:38:26.401 --> 00:38:27.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean being the prior,</v>

1363
00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.130
<v Speaker 1>that's even less,</v>

1364
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:33.360
<v Speaker 1>even less likely to be brought up a chicks don't want to hear about that.</v>

1365
00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:35.990
<v Speaker 1>So it was okay to eat before we were married.</v>

1366
00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:36.950
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know you.</v>

1367
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know you existed.</v>

1368
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:40.850
<v Speaker 2>I ate a little ass before I knew you existed.</v>

1369
00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:41.923
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

1370
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:44.750
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't have waited until it was the special one.</v>

1371
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.100
<v Speaker 2>Even couldn't have waited.</v>

1372
00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.560
<v Speaker 3>Eating ass is something that came later to me in life.</v>

1373
00:38:48.561 --> 00:38:48.801
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1374
00:38:48.801 --> 00:38:48.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1375
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:49.930
<v Speaker 3>like blue cheese,</v>

1376
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.040
<v Speaker 3>you don't like blue cheese most of your life and one day you're like,</v>

1377
00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:52.341
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1378
00:38:52.341 --> 00:38:53.001
<v Speaker 3>this is really good.</v>

1379
00:38:53.001 --> 00:38:54.200
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't like eating out now.</v>

1380
00:38:54.201 --> 00:38:55.270
<v Speaker 3>I love eating the girl's ass.</v>

1381
00:38:55.271 --> 00:38:56.300
<v Speaker 3>It's one of my favorite things ever.</v>

1382
00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.030
<v Speaker 3>Well how long ago did this start?</v>

1383
00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1384
00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:00.900
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1385
00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:04.410
<v Speaker 1>like when you started dating freaks now as you went through the Brian Red Band,</v>

1386
00:39:04.411 --> 00:39:07.500
<v Speaker 1>you went into your brian red band freak period a few years back.</v>

1387
00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:10.620
<v Speaker 1>It's coincidentally right when we started doing this podcast.</v>

1388
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1389
00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:13.640
<v Speaker 3>I think it was right around that time.</v>

1390
00:39:13.641 --> 00:39:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're right before</v>

1391
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:17.890
<v Speaker 1>ducted into the world with girls with troubled childhoods.</v>

1392
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:19.120
<v Speaker 1>And then boom,</v>

1393
00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.530
<v Speaker 2>we're off to the race 33,</v>

1394
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.760
<v Speaker 2>33 or 34 years.</v>

1395
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:23.590
<v Speaker 2>You were off to the races.</v>

1396
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.440
<v Speaker 2>And the problem is when you,</v>

1397
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.520
<v Speaker 1>you deal with like the world of Uber Freak,</v>

1398
00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:31.010
<v Speaker 1>professional sex workers essentially,</v>

1399
00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:31.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1400
00:39:31.761 --> 00:39:32.600
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're dealing with.</v>

1401
00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:36.470
<v Speaker 1>And then to try to go from that to like some girl who was working on her</v>

1402
00:39:36.471 --> 00:39:37.460
<v Speaker 1>accounting degree,</v>

1403
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1404
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:39.590
<v Speaker 3>it is it,</v>

1405
00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:40.550
<v Speaker 3>is there any hope?</v>

1406
00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.030
<v Speaker 3>Are you spoil,</v>

1407
00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:43.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1408
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:43.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1409
00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:44.250
<v Speaker 3>you're fucked.</v>

1410
00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:44.441
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1411
00:39:44.441 --> 00:39:44.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1412
00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:45.420
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>

1413
00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:46.200

1414
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Your baton quite a bit over your head.</v>

1415
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.930
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1416
00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:52.620
<v Speaker 1>that's hard to keep going in the regular world because in the regular world</v>

1417
00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:55.650
<v Speaker 1>girls will eventually get mad at you in the porn world.</v>

1418
00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.360
<v Speaker 1>They're just happy that they have a man.</v>

1419
00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Like they're happy that someone's there for them and someone loves them and</v>

1420
00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:03.390
<v Speaker 1>someone doesn't just treat them as something that just come inside of,</v>

<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1445
00:40:50.741 --> 00:40:54.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's on it's way more fun to just date a bunch of freaks,</v>

1448
00:40:55.411 --> 00:40:59.850
<v Speaker 1>if you're just trying to fuck the problem is if you want to really settle down</v>

1449
00:40:59.851 --> 00:41:00.930
<v Speaker 1>and have a relationship,</v>

1453
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:17.530
<v Speaker 3>do you think if a woman's a Nympho and you date an info for like a year and a</v>

1454
00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:17.531
<v Speaker 3>half,</v>

1457
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:23.140
<v Speaker 3>that you would then become a Nympho because you have to be on her same.</v>

1458
00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:23.620
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1459
00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:24.453
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1460
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:27.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a theme park that you leave.</v>

1461
00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:29.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1462
00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:31.591
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

1463
00:41:31.591 --> 00:41:32.670
<v Speaker 2>That's a good way of looking at it.</v>

1464
00:41:32.671 --> 00:41:33.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1465
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.063
<v Speaker 2>Some girls,</v>

1466
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.920
<v Speaker 1>there's some girls I dated a girl,</v>

1467
00:41:35.921 --> 00:41:37.670
<v Speaker 1>ones that couldn't come to,</v>

1468
00:41:37.671 --> 00:41:38.240
<v Speaker 1>couldn't come.</v>

1469
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Like she never had orgasms,</v>

1470
00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.000
<v Speaker 1>but she wanted to fuck all the time.</v>

1471
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:42.650
<v Speaker 1>It was craziness.</v>

1472
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:43.610
<v Speaker 1>They want to keep trying,</v>

1473
00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:47.270
<v Speaker 1>but she couldn't do it like she did like and everybody says,</v>

1474
00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:47.601
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1475
00:41:47.601 --> 00:41:49.310
<v Speaker 1>you just didn't know how to make her come.</v>

1476
00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:51.320
<v Speaker 1>She didn't even know how to make her come.</v>

1477
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Like nobody knew how to make her come.</v>

1478
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:55.700
<v Speaker 1>She could never finger herself and make herself calm.</v>

1479
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:59.210
<v Speaker 1>There was like one way where she could get herself to come,</v>

1480
00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:01.520
<v Speaker 1>but it was really hard and it didn't always work,</v>

1481
00:42:01.521 --> 00:42:02.354
<v Speaker 1>but it was</v>

1482
00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:04.363
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing was,</v>

1483
00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:09.580
<v Speaker 1>it was a real crazy sort of situation because you knew that sex feels good for</v>

1484
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:11.510
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

1485
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.760
<v Speaker 1>but you always felt guilty because she couldn't come.</v>

1486
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:14.780
<v Speaker 1>She'd get wet and shit.</v>

1487
00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:16.130
<v Speaker 1>She loved to fuck.</v>

1488
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:17.300
<v Speaker 1>That was the crazy thing.</v>

1489
00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:19.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like something was off,</v>

1490
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.473
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1491
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.950
<v Speaker 1>but she wanted to fuck all the time.</v>

1492
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.580
<v Speaker 1>But if you date a girl who wants to fuck all the time and then you date a girl</v>

1493
00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:26.750
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to fuck all the time,</v>

1494
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.910
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're used to it and you like it,</v>

1495
00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:29.780
<v Speaker 1>you like,</v>

1496
00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1497
00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:31.521
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1498
00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:36.350
<v Speaker 1>but you're awake and I'm awake and we're right here and we can just take our</v>

1499
00:42:36.351 --> 00:42:37.260
<v Speaker 1>clothes off and fuck it.</v>

1500
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.113
<v Speaker 1>Why wouldn't we do that?</v>

1501
00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it.</v>

1502
00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:39.351
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1503
00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:39.800
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1504
00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.350
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't even make sense to a dude.</v>

1505
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.691
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1506
00:42:41.691 --> 00:42:42.680
<v Speaker 1>that's a useless.</v>

1507
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.060
<v Speaker 1>That's a useless partner.</v>

1508
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:44.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1509
00:42:44.451 --> 00:42:45.290
<v Speaker 1>to a dude.</v>

1510
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:45.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1511
00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:46.410
<v Speaker 1>we'll have.</v>

1512
00:42:46.410 --> 00:42:49.520
<v Speaker 1>The third thing is we supposed to be looking for as many opportunities as</v>

1513
00:42:49.521 --> 00:42:50.480
<v Speaker 1>possible to fuck.</v>

1514
00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:51.780
<v Speaker 1>That's why we're boyfriend,</v>

1515
00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:52.250
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend.</v>

1516
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1517
00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:53.960
<v Speaker 1>So what are we doing here?</v>

1518
00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:54.910
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to talk.</v>

1519
00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:55.611
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1520
00:42:55.611 --> 00:42:56.271
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to fuck,</v>

1521
00:42:56.271 --> 00:42:57.590
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing holding you back.</v>

1522
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.960
<v Speaker 1>You're not fucking talking and then you're in trouble.</v>

1523
00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:01.670
<v Speaker 1>But if nothing's holding you back,</v>

1524
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:02.720
<v Speaker 1>like it's not like you have.</v>

1525
00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:02.960
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1526
00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.280
<v Speaker 1>I would love to fuck right now,</v>

1527
00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:06.290
<v Speaker 1>but I have to go to work,</v>

1528
00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:06.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:07.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm late.</v>

1531
00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:08.683
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>

1532
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:09.590
<v Speaker 1>But if it's like,</v>

1533
00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:09.741
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

00:43:11.541 --> 00:43:12.290
<v Speaker 1>You got to get rid of that.</v>

1538
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:12.981
<v Speaker 1>Like the summer.</v>

1539
00:43:12.981 --> 00:43:14.900
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing on HBO and we're not fucking.</v>

1540
00:43:14.901 --> 00:43:15.734
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>

1541
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:16.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1542
00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:17.043
<v Speaker 1>you got to get rid of that.</v>

1543
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:17.930
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1544
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:22.040
<v Speaker 1>that's where probably gay dudes understanding each other more better.</v>

1545
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.233
<v Speaker 1>Like they probably,</v>

1546
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:24.920
<v Speaker 1>they probably just give up the ass.</v>

1547
00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:29.070
<v Speaker 3>They tell you the guy at starbucks,</v>

1548
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:30.330

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.670
<v Speaker 3>I wear this grinder hat just for fun once in a while.</v>

1555
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:36.863
<v Speaker 3>It's a bad idea.</v>

1556
00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:37.883
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:07.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1588
00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:12.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean don't you think about that even when a girl's willing to fuck you,</v>

1589
00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:13.630
<v Speaker 1>like when you have sex with your girl?</v>

1590
00:44:13.631 --> 00:44:14.140
<v Speaker 1>Don't.</v>

1591
00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:14.951
<v Speaker 1>I always think like,</v>

1592
00:44:14.951 --> 00:44:15.970
<v Speaker 1>why do you like Dick?</v>

1593
00:44:15.971 --> 00:44:16.150
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1594
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.871
<v Speaker 1>what is going on here?</v>

1595
00:44:16.871 --> 00:44:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Why do you like dudes?</v>

1596
00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:17.891
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1597
00:44:17.891 --> 00:44:18.100
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

1598
00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Why would you like a guy?</v>

1599
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.721
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1600
00:44:19.721 --> 00:44:20.554
<v Speaker 1>I don't get it.</v>

1601
00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand the attraction to a man,</v>

1602
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:23.990
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1603
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:26.240
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm just glad they liked it,</v>

1604
00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:26.651
<v Speaker 3>medium,</v>

1605
00:44:26.651 --> 00:44:26.940
<v Speaker 3>Asian,</v>

1606
00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:27.773
<v Speaker 3>Dick.</v>

1607
00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:33.570
<v Speaker 3>Not saying that there's anything wrong</v>

1608
00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:34.420
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1609
00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:34.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1610
00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:36.120
<v Speaker 1>being a heterosexual woman.</v>

1611
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:37.950
<v Speaker 1>All I'm saying is I don't understand it.</v>

1612
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.580
<v Speaker 1>Just like you wouldn't understand like being a gay dude either,</v>

1613
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.490
<v Speaker 1>but if you were so afflicted with that predilection and you did,</v>

1614
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:46.530
<v Speaker 1>that's what you enjoyed?</v>

1615
00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:46.831
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1616
00:44:46.831 --> 00:44:47.130
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

1617
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that's a freer life.</v>

1618
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.180
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1619
00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:49.680
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1620
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.000
<v Speaker 3>I just loved that they love it.</v>

1621
00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:55.320
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm really glad you liked the shit because I got a lot of it.</v>

1622
00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:57.453
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

1623
00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:00.860
<v Speaker 1>there's a gay couple down the street from me and they're like trying to fit in.</v>

1624
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean they do fit in great neighbors but they're trying to fit in like a</v>

1625
00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.950
<v Speaker 1>regular family.</v>

1626
00:45:07.951 --> 00:45:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Like they adopted a kid and you know,</v>

1627
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.690
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1628
00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:13.400
<v Speaker 1>they do all the same shit that regular families do.</v>

1629
00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:13.791
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1630
00:45:13.791 --> 00:45:17.930
<v Speaker 1>not that there's anything unregular about what is something unregular about two</v>

1631
00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:19.220
<v Speaker 1>gay dudes obviously,</v>

1632
00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.840
<v Speaker 1>but as one of them can't get pregnant,</v>

1633
00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:21.770
<v Speaker 1>it's totally great.</v>

1634
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.140
<v Speaker 3>The thing is is like you shouldn't try to fit in like you're Asian,</v>

1635
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:25.561
<v Speaker 3>you're black,</v>

1636
00:45:25.561 --> 00:45:25.981
<v Speaker 3>you're gay.</v>

1637
00:45:25.981 --> 00:45:26.671
<v Speaker 3>Like just be.</v>

1638
00:45:26.671 --> 00:45:28.230
<v Speaker 3>That was great,</v>

1639
00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:29.201
<v Speaker 1>but I mean when,</v>

1640
00:45:29.201 --> 00:45:30.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean by trying to fit in,</v>

1641
00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:31.660
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have probably said it that way,</v>

1642
00:45:31.661 --> 00:45:33.190
<v Speaker 1>but what I meant was that there,</v>

1643
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:33.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1644
00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.770
<v Speaker 1>they live like a normal family.</v>

1645
00:45:35.771 --> 00:45:38.980
<v Speaker 1>They're like they're gay married couple with a kid,</v>

1646
00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:39.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1647
00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.680
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have a hard time with that man.</v>

1648
00:45:41.681 --> 00:45:41.860
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1649
00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:42.760
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting.</v>

1650
00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:47.290
<v Speaker 1>But I think here like California is probably as loose as it gets with how people</v>

1651
00:45:47.291 --> 00:45:48.370
<v Speaker 1>like view that.</v>

1652
00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:50.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what kind of grief they catch,</v>

1653
00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:55.330
<v Speaker 1>but all the people that I know around them are like totally normal with it,</v>

1654
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.630
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1655
00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:00.310
<v Speaker 1>it's like if they wanted to,</v>

1656
00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:04.300
<v Speaker 1>any one of those guys could just drive down Santa Monica Boulevard,</v>

1657
00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.270
<v Speaker 1>just enter into one of those clubs.</v>

1658
00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Just pull your cock out and just get the grinder on,</v>

1659
00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:10.900
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

1660
00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.190
<v Speaker 1>get the slap happy on.</v>

1661
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:13.263
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1662
00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:14.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a,</v>

1663
00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:18.250
<v Speaker 1>there's no place like that for dudes now because there's no place like that for</v>

1664
00:46:18.251 --> 00:46:22.150
<v Speaker 1>guys where you can just guarantee that you could go and there'd be a bunch of</v>

1665
00:46:22.151 --> 00:46:23.770
<v Speaker 1>horny checks looking for dudes.</v>

1666
00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:24.160
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

1667
00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.370
<v Speaker 3>in New York there are places like Bob in the lower east side,</v>

1668
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.220
<v Speaker 3>you go and there's always like a fat chick waiting for you.</v>

1669
00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:31.210
<v Speaker 3>What is Bob?</v>

1670
00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:36.420
<v Speaker 3>Bob is like 500 square foot hip hop like lounge situation and the lower east</v>

1671
00:46:37.481 --> 00:46:38.050
<v Speaker 3>side.</v>

1672
00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:39.100
<v Speaker 3>They play all golden era.</v>

1673
00:46:39.101 --> 00:46:39.371
<v Speaker 3>Hip Hop.</v>

1674
00:46:39.371 --> 00:46:39.791
<v Speaker 3>You go in,</v>

1675
00:46:39.791 --> 00:46:40.630
<v Speaker 3>everyone's sweating,</v>

1676
00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:44.950
<v Speaker 3>dancing and you always get asked and Okcupid is amazing.</v>

1677
00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:45.501
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>

1678
00:46:45.501 --> 00:46:47.080
<v Speaker 3>I abused with Okcupid.</v>

1679
00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:48.790
<v Speaker 3>Okcupid is like a website.</v>

1680
00:46:48.791 --> 00:46:50.110
<v Speaker 3>You go on and you can literally,</v>

1681
00:46:50.111 --> 00:46:51.850
<v Speaker 3>people have boxes like just looking to fuck.</v>

1682
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:56.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like Grindr for heterosexuals for any sexuals.</v>

1683
00:46:57.130 --> 00:47:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Like you could have three eyes and find some other fuck with three eyes and</v>

1684
00:47:00.101 --> 00:47:00.670
<v Speaker 3>wants to fuck.</v>

1685
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:00.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1686
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:02.830
<v Speaker 3>but they're almost the same people.</v>

1687
00:47:02.831 --> 00:47:05.020
<v Speaker 3>If you go to Craig's list and just like look in your area,</v>

1688
00:47:05.021 --> 00:47:08.200
<v Speaker 3>like looking to fuck type girls and then sometimes there's a picture.</v>

1689
00:47:08.201 --> 00:47:09.820
<v Speaker 3>There's never been one that I've gone,</v>

1690
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:10.840
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1691
00:47:10.841 --> 00:47:11.291
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

1692
00:47:11.291 --> 00:47:13.630
<v Speaker 3>I need to fuck this girl that I've.</v>

1693
00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:16.120
<v Speaker 3>I've had one on Okcupid.</v>

1694
00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.740
<v Speaker 3>I found a unicorn that was pretty good.</v>

1695
00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:19.421
<v Speaker 3>They'll tell us like,</v>

1696
00:47:19.421 --> 00:47:19.840
<v Speaker 3>what happened?</v>

1697
00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:20.650
<v Speaker 3>It was bad,</v>

1698
00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:21.483
<v Speaker 3>it was dope,</v>

1699
00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:22.300
<v Speaker 3>it was dope.</v>

1700
00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:24.610
<v Speaker 3>I ended up taking this Unicorn to vegas once.</v>

1701
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:25.503
<v Speaker 3>It was good.</v>

1702
00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:26.860
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of fun.</v>

1703
00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:27.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1704
00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:27.670
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

1705
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:28.870
<v Speaker 1>think that they exist.</v>

1706
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:33.850
<v Speaker 1>I know that there's probably a lot of girls that are super hot that would love</v>

1707
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:35.560
<v Speaker 1>to freak a guy out like that.</v>

1708
00:47:35.561 --> 00:47:38.710
<v Speaker 1>A guy couldn't believe how hot they are and they just want to fuck.</v>

1709
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:40.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of crazy bitches like that.</v>

1710
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:41.343
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of them.</v>

1711
00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:41.591
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1712
00:47:41.591 --> 00:47:45.100
<v Speaker 2>in New York there's a lot of girls at work and they don't have time to go out</v>

1713
00:47:45.101 --> 00:47:47.110
<v Speaker 2>and date and meet dudes and pick them and they're like,</v>

1714
00:47:47.111 --> 00:47:47.610
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's would be great.</v>

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.030
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking awesome.</v>

1722
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.800
<v Speaker 2>You guys need that,</v>

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:57.000

<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely known Jewish girls.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Give the best head.</v>

1777
00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:05.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1778
00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:05.903
<v Speaker 1>When they do it.</v>

1779
00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:07.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1780
00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.193
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1781
00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Then there's that old joke.</v>

1782
00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:11.250
<v Speaker 1>How do you stop a Jewish check from blowing you?</v>

1783
00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Killer barrier.</v>

1784
00:49:14.430 --> 00:49:15.263
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1785
00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:19.493
<v Speaker 2>that's a good one.</v>

1786
00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:20.001
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1787
00:49:20.001 --> 00:49:20.550
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

1788
00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:22.290
<v Speaker 2>isn't it because like they are,</v>

1789
00:49:22.291 --> 00:49:26.250
<v Speaker 2>so since they're young they're always said you have to only have sex with Jewish</v>

1790
00:49:26.251 --> 00:49:29.430
<v Speaker 2>people and you never supposed to be with anyone outside of your race.</v>

1791
00:49:29.431 --> 00:49:31.920
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's why they're so crazy in bed.</v>

1792
00:49:31.921 --> 00:49:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you think so.</v>

1793
00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1794
00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:33.990
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1795
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:36.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm just guessing not as suppressed.</v>

1796
00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:37.500
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

1797
00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:41.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a less suppression in that religion than there is like sexually in like</v>

1798
00:49:41.431 --> 00:49:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism and you know,</v>

1799
00:49:43.051 --> 00:49:44.580
<v Speaker 1>a lot of other Christian religions.</v>

1800
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:46.300
<v Speaker 2>It might be the Hitler Christ am I wear all the time.</v>

1801
00:49:46.310 --> 00:49:47.143
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1802
00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:48.370
<v Speaker 2>I want to hate.</v>

1803

<v Speaker 1>It was totally different.</v>

1841
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.901
<v Speaker 1>Bang.</v>

1842
00:50:38.901 --> 00:50:39.561
<v Speaker 1>A chick like that.</v>

1843
00:50:39.561 --> 00:50:41.030
<v Speaker 1>It's a completely different experience.</v>

1844
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:42.290
<v Speaker 1>Like they're not.</v>

1845
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:43.123
<v Speaker 1>They're not shy.</v>

1846
00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:43.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1847
00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:43.940
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1848
00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I've never gotten older.</v>

1849
00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I've always gotten younger.</v>

1850
00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:47.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1851
00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:48.740
<v Speaker 1>That was the only time I ever did.</v>

1852
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Maybe one of the time.</v>

1853
00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:50.811
<v Speaker 1>One of the time I did it,</v>

1854
00:50:50.811 --> 00:50:52.070
<v Speaker 1>the girl was like a year older than me,</v>

1855
00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.730
<v Speaker 1>which is acceptable and I want to do a cougar once.</v>

1856
00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:59.300
<v Speaker 1>I just think I see some because there's so many hot cougars here in Los Angeles</v>

1857
00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:00.443
<v Speaker 1>to join a gym.</v>

1858
00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.270
<v Speaker 1>If you want to get a real cougar,</v>

1859
00:51:02.271 --> 00:51:03.170
<v Speaker 1>you got to join a gym.</v>

1860
00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm a teddy bear.</v>

1861
00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Teddy bear with muscles.</v>

1862
00:51:07.551 --> 00:51:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:08.061
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1864
00:51:08.061 --> 00:51:11.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying if you want to really meet the ones that you actually want to fuck,</v>

1865
00:51:11.211 --> 00:51:14.300
<v Speaker 1>you got to meet the ones that are at the gym because the ones that go to the gym</v>

1866
00:51:14.301 --> 00:51:17.480
<v Speaker 1>or the ones who still have the plump passes and they're like 50.</v>

1867
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:20.900
<v Speaker 1>I've seen tricks with great assets that are 50 and you can't believe it.</v>

1868
00:51:20.901 --> 00:51:21.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like God damn.</v>

1869
00:51:21.831 --> 00:51:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1870
00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:25.820
<v Speaker 1>Because that bitch is addicted to spin class and she's in there the fuck</v>

1871
00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:28.500

1966
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:04.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1967
00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:07.980
<v Speaker 2>I think for some girls I dated a girl who.</v>

1968
00:54:07.981 --> 00:54:08.191
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1969
00:54:08.191 --> 00:54:08.640
<v Speaker 2>she had an.</v>

1970
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Before I met her.</v>

1971
00:54:09.511 --> 00:54:11.130
<v Speaker 2>She had had a breast reduction.</v>

1972
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:15.240
<v Speaker 2>She had enormous tits and even when I met her they were like d cups and I was</v>

1973
00:54:15.241 --> 00:54:15.350
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1974
00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:15.771
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1975
00:54:15.771 --> 00:54:16.604
<v Speaker 2>they were bigger than this.</v>

1976
00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Like she had like back pain.</v>

1977
00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:20.280
<v Speaker 2>So she would get pinched nerves and shit.</v>

1978
00:54:20.281 --> 00:54:21.480
<v Speaker 2>Like they just can go numb,</v>

1979
00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:25.300
<v Speaker 2>but still I feel like you have tits that big things will happen for you.</v>

1980
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:26.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1981
00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:27.690
<v Speaker 2>other things will take care of.</v>

1982
00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:29.820
<v Speaker 2>Someone will come on and that's it.</v>

1983
00:54:29.821 --> 00:54:33.210
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they come fucking bean stocks and take it to the match.</v>

1984
00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:35.340
<v Speaker 2>If you have a herniated disc and I come on your back,</v>

1985
00:54:35.341 --> 00:54:36.440
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't help much.</v>

1986
00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Not doing anybody any good.</v>

1987
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:39.820
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you're rubbing it in.</v>

1988
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:41.000
<v Speaker 2>It's Vicks Vapor Rub,</v>

1989
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.620
<v Speaker 2>heal the injury.</v>

1990
00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:47.310
<v Speaker 2>I've talked about this before that I know somebody who has that disease.</v>

1991
00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the name of it,</v>

1992
00:54:48.571 --> 00:54:48.920
<v Speaker 2>where they're.</v>

1993
00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.760
<v Speaker 2>Your tits are crazy big like,</v>

1994
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:52.200
<v Speaker 2>like they're almost worms,</v>

1995
00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:53.300
<v Speaker 2>like 10 scientists.</v>

1996
00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:54.540
<v Speaker 2>Titus of the tips.</v>

1997
00:54:54.550 --> 00:54:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1998
00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:55.561
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1999
00:54:55.561 --> 00:54:56.850
<v Speaker 2>And it's so big that she,</v>

2000
00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:57.870
<v Speaker 2>if you look at her,</v>

2001
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:59.370
<v Speaker 2>she looks like she's really fat,</v>

2002
00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.160
<v Speaker 2>but then she takes off her shirt and just holds up her tits.</v>

2003
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:02.550
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2004
00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:02.881
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

2005
00:55:02.881 --> 00:55:05.120
<v Speaker 2>it's all just tit and body like sand.</v>

2006
00:55:05.121 --> 00:55:07.530
<v Speaker 2>So how big would you say her?</v>

2007
00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:09.810
<v Speaker 2>Like twice a normal tip.</v>

2008
00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2009
00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:15.770
<v Speaker 2>I would say each one of her tits was probably a,</v>

2010
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:17.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2011
00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:20.670
<v Speaker 2>24 inches long and a 24 inch.</v>

2012
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Probably each one weighed probably I'd say about 50 pounds.</v>

2013
00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2014
00:55:25.591 --> 00:55:26.281

<v Speaker 2>I know that you have like a fucking three foot like baby arm.</v>

2038
00:56:01.951 --> 00:56:05.490
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to only date chicks that fuck basketball players and had</v>

2041
00:56:12.031 --> 00:56:13.860
<v Speaker 2>You need a girl who's had a bunch of babies,</v>

2042
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:16.180
<v Speaker 2>so she talked to mom your giant months.</v>

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:17.731
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2045
00:56:17.731 --> 00:56:20.220
<v Speaker 2>That's the only thing you could be happy with because otherwise,</v>

2046
00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:21.870
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do with three foot of deck?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what you're gonna do.</v>

2048
00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:23.140
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

2049
00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:24.580
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get frustrated.</v>

2050
00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:24.810
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

2051
00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:26.070
<v Speaker 3>If I have a three foot dictum,</v>

2052
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:29.920
<v Speaker 3>I would just walk outside with that shit like I'm tanning would,</v>

2053
00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.950
<v Speaker 3>but you would never be able to really use it.</v>

2054
00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:33.700
<v Speaker 3>You will.</v>

2055
00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:36.520
<v Speaker 3>You don't want a three foot can have girls to slide on top of it.</v>

2056
00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:38.093
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2057
00:56:38.110 --> 00:56:39.550
<v Speaker 3>If you had a three foot dick,</v>

2058
00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:41.650
<v Speaker 3>there would be girls that would just want to check it out.</v>

2059
00:56:41.651 --> 00:56:43.990
<v Speaker 3>Just I just want to sit on it a little bit and trust me.</v>

2060
00:56:43.991 --> 00:56:47.960
<v Speaker 3>I know a couple of girls could probably put three foot inside of them airtight.</v>

2061
00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:48.843
<v Speaker 3>They would break.</v>

2062
00:56:48.910 --> 00:56:51.490
<v Speaker 3>They would break just like the guy who got fucked to death by the horse.</v>

2063
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:52.600
<v Speaker 3>There's no way that would make it.</v>

2064
00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:55.150
<v Speaker 3>Dana could take three foot of Dick,</v>

2065
00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:56.500
<v Speaker 3>Dana Mostec.</v>

2066
00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:57.580
<v Speaker 3>Kira could take three foot.</v>

2067
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:58.750
<v Speaker 3>She where she wouldn't break.</v>

2068
00:56:58.900 --> 00:56:59.650
<v Speaker 3>She would die.</v>

2069
00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:00.041
<v Speaker 3>She would die.</v>

2070
00:57:00.041 --> 00:57:02.260
<v Speaker 3>And you'd be one of those girls that did son of Dong.</v>

2071
00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:03.070

2095
00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:35.380
<v Speaker 3>What is this stuff that you've been doing for a.</v>

2096
00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:38.080
<v Speaker 3>for Vice magazine Dot Com.</v>

2097
00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:42.100
<v Speaker 3>I do this show called fresh off the boat and we use food to get into culture and</v>

2098
00:57:42.101 --> 00:57:43.150
<v Speaker 3>we meet all these Weirdos.</v>

2099
00:57:43.151 --> 00:57:46.300
<v Speaker 3>Basically the whole point of the show is to travel around the world,</v>

2100
00:57:46.301 --> 00:57:49.090
<v Speaker 3>traveling around the United States and find stories and people that other</v>

2101
00:57:49.091 --> 00:57:50.290
<v Speaker 3>outlets don't want to talk about.</v>

2102
00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:51.573
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2103
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:52.483
<v Speaker 3>what kind of,</v>

2104
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:53.270
<v Speaker 3>what kind of stores.</v>

2105
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.711
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>

2106
00:57:53.711 --> 00:57:56.070
<v Speaker 3>like we went in the bank bus with j Dot Stevens in Miami.</v>

2107
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.490
<v Speaker 3>Fritos.</v>

2108
00:57:57.490 --> 00:57:58.240
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

2109
00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.340
<v Speaker 3>we watched her work and we did that whole episode.</v>

2110
00:58:00.341 --> 00:58:01.174
<v Speaker 3>We went to go see him,</v>

2111
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:02.720
<v Speaker 3>watch her do a bang bus.</v>

2112
00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:03.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2113
00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:05.140
<v Speaker 3>We watched the whole thing.</v>

2114
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.570
<v Speaker 3>So what do they do that they.</v>

2115
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:08.760
<v Speaker 3>You put her in the bus.</v>

2116
00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:09.910
<v Speaker 3>It was reversed bus,</v>

2117
00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:10.300
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2118
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:11.650
<v Speaker 3>So they put her in the back of the bus.</v>

2119
00:58:11.651 --> 00:58:14.860
<v Speaker 3>They drive around and they pick up dudes off the street to just bang,</v>

2120
00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:15.670
<v Speaker 3>here's the trailer.</v>

2121
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:16.810
<v Speaker 3>What's a reverse bus?</v>

2122
00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:18.070
<v Speaker 3>The reverse buses.</v>

2123
00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:19.240
<v Speaker 3>Her going in and doing that,</v>

2124
00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:23.050
<v Speaker 3>the bank was normally is a dude driving around and find chicks on the street,</v>

2125
00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:28.140
<v Speaker 3>a reverse bosses her looking for and then other shows we've done is we went to</v>

2126
00:58:29.081 --> 00:58:29.360
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>

2127
00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:33.280
<v Speaker 3>We didn't want to separate people from the slaughter because we want people to</v>

2128
00:58:33.281 --> 00:58:34.720
<v Speaker 3>know you're eating food,</v>

2129
00:58:34.721 --> 00:58:37.240
<v Speaker 3>you're eating animal protein and animal is slaughtered.</v>

2130
00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.180
<v Speaker 3>So the first episode we ever did was showing like a white rabbit being</v>

2131
00:58:40.181 --> 00:58:40.630
<v Speaker 3>slaughtered.</v>

2132
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:41.410
<v Speaker 3>I saw that one.</v>

2133
00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:42.010
<v Speaker 3>Do you like it?</v>

2134
00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:42.843
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2135
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:47.410
<v Speaker 3>We're like a pretty thoughtful food show and we try to challenge people really</v>

2136
00:58:47.411 --> 00:58:48.310
<v Speaker 3>want to challenge them.</v>

2137
00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.110
<v Speaker 3>We don't just give them candy is not just.</v>

2138
00:58:50.130 --> 00:58:52.000
<v Speaker 3>So we really want them to think about,</v>

2139
00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:52.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2140
00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.810
<v Speaker 3>the culture that,</v>

2141
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:56.550
<v Speaker 3>that they're engrossed in the cultures that they're supporting and,</v>

2142
00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:57.403
<v Speaker 3>and things like that.</v>

2143
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:59.800
<v Speaker 3>Was that the first time you ever killed an animal like that?</v>

2144
00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:00.640
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

2145
00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.473
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2146
00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:01.840
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

2147
00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:02.673
<v Speaker 3>we've killed animals.</v>

2148
00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:04.420
<v Speaker 3>I Cook Chinese food.</v>

2149
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.800
<v Speaker 3>So you're always cooking seafood,</v>

2150
00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:07.270
<v Speaker 3>cooking live seafood.</v>

2151
00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:09.150
<v Speaker 3>And then I've seen chicken slaughtered.</v>

2152
00:59:09.790 --> 00:59:12.850
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen a cow slaughter and never seen a pig slaughter,</v>

2153
00:59:12.851 --> 00:59:13.631
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen chickens.</v>

2154
00:59:13.631 --> 00:59:15.220
<v Speaker 3>I've seen seafood and I saw a rabbit.</v>

2155

2203
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:49.350
<v Speaker 3>You need to just chill the fuck out because there was nothing anyone can do for</v>

2204
01:00:49.351 --> 01:00:49.411
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2205
01:00:49.411 --> 01:00:49.681
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2206
01:00:49.681 --> 01:00:50.514
<v Speaker 3>did I just dies?</v>

2207
01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:50.730
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2208
01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:53.430
<v Speaker 3>you didn't die as high as fuck and you're being a pussy</v>

2209
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:55.390
<v Speaker 1>way described it.</v>

2210
01:00:55.391 --> 01:00:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Indigo bubblegum Hash Jerky.</v>

2211
01:00:58.490 --> 01:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>That's very specific to some chefs.</v>

2212
01:01:00.761 --> 01:01:00.940
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

2213
01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:01.773
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2214
01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:04.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2215
01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about it a billion times on the podcast,</v>

2216
01:01:06.701 --> 01:01:09.430
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people don't know that when you eat marijuana,</v>

2217
01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a totally different psychoactive experience.</v>

2218
01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Your body produces something,</v>

2219
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:19.270
<v Speaker 1>goes through your liver and it produces something called a one pass and it makes</v>

2220
01:01:19.271 --> 01:01:23.830
<v Speaker 1>this chemical called 11 hydroxy metabolite and it's four to five times more</v>

2221
01:01:23.831 --> 01:01:26.590
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive than thc in smokable form,</v>

2222
01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:29.230
<v Speaker 1>so it's not the same drug.</v>

2223
01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Can You die from that shit?</v>

2224
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.901
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2225
01:01:30.901 --> 01:01:31.131
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2226
01:01:31.131 --> 01:01:31.251
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2227
01:01:31.251 --> 01:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2228
01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2229
01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.450
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2230
01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:32.591
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2231
01:01:32.591 --> 01:01:35.260
<v Speaker 1>The only way you're going to die from drink,</v>

2232
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:36.050
<v Speaker 1>drink milk,</v>

2233
01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:36.883
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2234
01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Just trust me.</v>

2235
01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:41.310
<v Speaker 1>If you'll calm down like within five minutes does not scientifically about</v>

2236
01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:41.831
<v Speaker 1>listening to him.</v>

2237
01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:45.430
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know what the fuck you're going to throw up milk that's just need a</v>

2238
01:01:45.431 --> 01:01:46.151
<v Speaker 1>little glass of milk.</v>

2239
01:01:46.151 --> 01:01:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Just listen.</v>

2240
01:01:47.141 --> 01:01:48.100
<v Speaker 1>That's not scientific.</v>

2241
01:01:48.101 --> 01:01:48.341
<v Speaker 1>Brian.</v>

2242
01:01:48.341 --> 01:01:53.341
<v Speaker 1>You're talking nonsense because I eat as much hash is that you're fucked.</v>

2243
01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to a glass of milk.</v>

2244
01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:55.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to make me feel fine,</v>

2245
01:01:56.870 --> 01:02:01.210
<v Speaker 1>but I ate fucking oldest fucking Hash jerky and I never felt so bad.</v>

2246
01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.440
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I did heroin.</v>

2247
01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:02.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2248
01:02:02.711 --> 01:02:04.300
<v Speaker 1>I can get you really scary high.</v>

2249
01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:07.060
<v Speaker 1>You can get to the point where it's really uncomfortable,</v>

2250
01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:07.630
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2251
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:08.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's that shit.</v>

2252
01:02:08.771 --> 01:02:13.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun to go to a hospital and tell people your spirit animals broken.</v>

2253
01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:14.443
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2254
01:02:14.710 --> 01:02:15.101
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2255
01:02:15.101 --> 01:02:15.510
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

2256
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:17.620
<v Speaker 1>I did think that I fucked up.</v>

2257
01:02:17.621 --> 01:02:18.401
<v Speaker 1>I went too far.</v>

2258
01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:18.561
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2259
01:02:18.561 --> 01:02:18.741
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

2260
01:02:18.741 --> 01:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten there before.</v>

2261
01:02:19.921 --> 01:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>We'd just like.</v>

2262
01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>But I always liked that I liked,</v>

2263
01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>I liked what it feels like when it's over,</v>

2264
01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>you're like me and weed are fighting because it's like I love this space for so</v>

2265
01:02:28.261 --> 01:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>long and I'm like,</v>

2266
01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>you really hurt me.</v>

2267
01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:31.170
<v Speaker 1>You really hurt me.</v>

2268
01:02:31.171 --> 01:02:32.320
<v Speaker 1>This do edibles.</v>

2269
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Edibles are amazing,</v>

2270
01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:36.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's all in the dosage.</v>

2271
01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.070
<v Speaker 1>It's very tricky.</v>

2272
01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:38.941
<v Speaker 1>I'd love that.</v>

2273
01:02:38.941 --> 01:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>A bowl.</v>

2274
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>So I prefer edibles</v>

2275
01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:42.880
<v Speaker 1>for regular Ed.</v>

2276
01:02:42.881 --> 01:02:43.714
<v Speaker 1>A bleeder?</v>

2277
01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:44.310

01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2279
01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:45.653
<v Speaker 1>I prefer it.</v>

2280
01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I think it's better for your body.</v>

2281
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I think it's better for your body and I think the,</v>

2282
01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.240
<v Speaker 1>the intensity of the experience,</v>

2283
01:02:51.241 --> 01:02:54.600
<v Speaker 1>it lasts longer and to me it's more introspective.</v>

2284
01:02:54.601 --> 01:02:55.440
<v Speaker 1>I learn more.</v>

2285
01:02:55.770 --> 01:02:55.951
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2286
01:02:55.951 --> 01:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>you definitely think of wild shit.</v>

2287
01:02:58.471 --> 01:02:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2288
01:02:59.130 --> 01:02:59.880
<v Speaker 1>I was saying,</v>

2289
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.910
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I was one of those Christian inspirational people because I'm in the</v>

2290
01:03:02.911 --> 01:03:03.080
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2292
01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Evan,</v>

2293
01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:07.110
<v Speaker 1>you have to realize that every day you have to fight to stay alive because as</v>

2294
01:03:07.111 --> 01:03:08.610
<v Speaker 1>soon as you stop you will die.</v>

2295
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:09.331
<v Speaker 1>I just thought,</v>

2296
01:03:09.331 --> 01:03:09.901
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God,</v>

2297
01:03:09.901 --> 01:03:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I just started watching house of cards.</v>

2298
01:03:11.071 --> 01:03:11.430
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2299
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:12.031
<v Speaker 1>you did not die.</v>

2300
01:03:12.031 --> 01:03:13.140
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>

2301
01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Just don't watch anymore.</v>

2302
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Spacey Movies.</v>

2303
01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the,</v>

2304
01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:17.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2305
01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:18.041
<v Speaker 1>the nine one,</v>

2306
01:03:18.041 --> 01:03:21.300
<v Speaker 1>one call where the cops stole some pot from some kids,</v>

2307
01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:25.260
<v Speaker 1>made some pot brownies and then the cops called nine slash 11</v>

2308
01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:28.440
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing.</v>

2309
01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.280
<v Speaker 1>They thought they died.</v>

2310
01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.290
<v Speaker 1>They thought that the time it stopped</v>

2311
01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:35.190
<v Speaker 1>calling in nine slash 11,</v>

2312
01:03:35.191 --> 01:03:38.220
<v Speaker 1>just shitting their pants thinking that this is the end.</v>

2313
01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2314
01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I thought I heard like the universe,</v>

2315
01:03:40.711 --> 01:03:41.544
<v Speaker 1>his voice was like,</v>

2316
01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>

2317
01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you've checked out.</v>

2318
01:03:43.270 --> 01:03:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2319
01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I really thought I died.</v>

2320
01:03:44.851 --> 01:03:45.040
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

2321
01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:45.873
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2322
01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>the game is over,</v>

2323
01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:47.923
<v Speaker 1>it's over.</v>

2324
01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:48.781
<v Speaker 1>I heard the theme.</v>

2325
01:03:48.781 --> 01:03:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Music to game is over.</v>

2326
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:51.990
<v Speaker 1>You can definitely too much pot,</v>

2327
01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:53.250
<v Speaker 1>but then after it's over,</v>

2328
01:03:53.251 --> 01:03:54.084
<v Speaker 1>you feel fine.</v>

2329
01:03:54.300 --> 01:03:55.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not even like getting drunk,</v>

2330
01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:56.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2331
01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.410
<v Speaker 1>that feeling that you get after you have a hangover.</v>

2332
01:03:58.411 --> 01:03:59.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like God damn it.</v>

2333
01:03:59.401 --> 01:04:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to ever Joel that I ate so much.</v>

2334
01:04:01.141 --> 01:04:02.460
<v Speaker 1>My head hurt for three days.</v>

2335
01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2336
01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:03.840
<v Speaker 1>I could not.</v>

2337
01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.350
<v Speaker 1>I did not.</v>

2338
01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:05.760
<v Speaker 1>It took me a while to come back.</v>

2339
01:04:05.761 --> 01:04:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Three days.</v>

2340
01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.540
<v Speaker 1>You probably broke something just with anxiety.</v>

2341
01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Just the anxiety alone was probably so much stress.</v>

2342
01:04:12.350 --> 01:04:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2343
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:13.111
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2344
01:04:13.111 --> 01:04:14.090
<v Speaker 1>your brain was like</v>

2345
01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:17.610
<v Speaker 1>the muscle in my brain.</v>

2346
01:04:17.611 --> 01:04:18.444
<v Speaker 1>Fucking hurt.</v>

2347
01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:19.530
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2348
01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:22.230
<v Speaker 1>kids don't eat that fucking bubblegum Hash.</v>

2349
01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:23.910
<v Speaker 1>I find that edibles,</v>

2350
01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:28.370
<v Speaker 1>make food tastes the best too because I think smoking anything probably Dolan's</v>

2351
01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>your palate a little bit and you have like um,</v>

2352
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:37.000
<v Speaker 1>options out here without a bolts that are fairly delicious.</v>

2353
01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:37.590
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2354
01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:42.330
<v Speaker 1>but also you can actually like pretty much rely on the dose with someone like</v>

2355
01:04:42.331 --> 01:04:43.164
<v Speaker 1>candies.</v>

2356
01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:43.761
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2357
01:04:43.761 --> 01:04:44.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2358
01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:45.920
<v Speaker 1>like you'll like Ari Shaffir.</v>

2359
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.531
<v Speaker 1>I'll ask him like,</v>

2360
01:04:46.531 --> 01:04:46.891
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>

2361
01:04:46.891 --> 01:04:47.431
<v Speaker 1>Candy goes,</v>

2362
01:04:47.431 --> 01:04:48.750
<v Speaker 1>it's like a half a breath strip.</v>

2363
01:04:49.070 --> 01:04:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2364
01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:50.100
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2365
01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:50.550
<v Speaker 1>got it.</v>

2366
01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:51.383
<v Speaker 1>But not always.</v>

2367
01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:51.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2368
01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:52.590
<v Speaker 1>not always.</v>

2369
01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:53.880
<v Speaker 1>It's still not accurate.</v>

2370
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:54.540
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

2371
01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:57.540
<v Speaker 1>But some companies like you get used to a company you know,</v>

2372
01:04:57.541 --> 01:05:01.030
<v Speaker 1>and they got their shit together and they can make it until the feds come and</v>

2373
01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:03.120
<v Speaker 1>buster door down and fucking take him away.</v>

2374
01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:03.961
<v Speaker 1>Problem with edibles.</v>

2375
01:05:03.961 --> 01:05:06.270
<v Speaker 1>It's also how much you have in your stomach already.</v>

2376
01:05:06.271 --> 01:05:08.790
<v Speaker 1>So that's a factor where you know when you smoke it,</v>

2377
01:05:08.791 --> 01:05:09.870
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to deal with that.</v>

2378
01:05:09.871 --> 01:05:12.180
<v Speaker 1>That's where breast strips come in because it doesn't matter because it just</v>

2379
01:05:12.181 --> 01:05:13.230
<v Speaker 1>goes into your bloodstream.</v>

2380
01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.033
<v Speaker 1>Crazy</v>

2381
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.020
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated out here on</v>

2382
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:19.000
<v Speaker 5>the west coast,</v>

2383
01:05:19.001 --> 01:05:20.120
<v Speaker 5>kid it.</v>

2384
01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:22.090
<v Speaker 5>How hard is it getting good weed in New York?</v>

2385
01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:22.931
<v Speaker 5>Yo,</v>

2386
01:05:22.931 --> 01:05:24.220
<v Speaker 5>I got a really good service.</v>

2387
01:05:24.221 --> 01:05:24.970
<v Speaker 5>I have served that.</v>

2388
01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:27.820
<v Speaker 5>They come through and they always have seven to eight strands every time.</v>

2389
01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:29.770
<v Speaker 5>But before I met these dudes,</v>

2390
01:05:29.771 --> 01:05:30.760
<v Speaker 5>life was miserable.</v>

2391
01:05:30.761 --> 01:05:32.700
<v Speaker 5>It was just like sour or haze or,</v>

2392
01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:33.041
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

2393
01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:33.490
<v Speaker 5>or,</v>

2394
01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:34.120
<v Speaker 5>or Kush.</v>

2395
01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:37.900
<v Speaker 5>It's just hard to find someone that you actually want to know your phone number</v>

2396
01:05:37.901 --> 01:05:40.060
<v Speaker 5>that's selling weed and these dudes are adults.</v>

2397
01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:41.170
<v Speaker 5>They don't show what you,</v>

2398
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:44.140
<v Speaker 5>they don't fucking try to like hang out and get to know your life in and out.</v>

2399
01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:47.200
<v Speaker 5>Like give me the best weed and I'll see you later and I'll call you next time.</v>

2400
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:48.220
<v Speaker 5>So that's what you need.</v>

2401
01:05:48.221 --> 01:05:53.080
<v Speaker 5>But it does not touch California like California is on some shit.</v>

2402
01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:53.630
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

2403
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:54.463
<v Speaker 5>That's the best.</v>

2404
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:57.340
<v Speaker 5>I got a GPA.</v>

2405
01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:57.880
<v Speaker 5>Those do.</v>

2406
01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.660
<v Speaker 5>I'll hook you up.</v>

2407
01:05:58.660 --> 01:05:59.710
<v Speaker 5>Those dudes are awesome.</v>

2408
01:05:59.740 --> 01:06:00.220
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>

2409
01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:00.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2410
01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:04.030
<v Speaker 5>The G pen is the best way to smoke because the wax tastes so good.</v>

2411
01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:09.480
<v Speaker 5>It's like minty fresh chocolate mint ice cream has g and g pen?</v>

2412
01:06:09.610 --> 01:06:11.080
<v Speaker 5>A new type of vaporizer or something?</v>

2413
01:06:11.110 --> 01:06:12.730
<v Speaker 5>There's a few of them are going to get you one.</v>

2414
01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:13.960
<v Speaker 5>So many of them out.</v>

2415
01:06:13.961 --> 01:06:15.160
<v Speaker 5>But have you had an idea lab?</v>

2416
01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:16.700
<v Speaker 5>I DAB is the way to go in,</v>

2417
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:20.950
<v Speaker 5>in your home like on the road pen the best but I dabs are fucking crazy.</v>

2418
01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:21.671
<v Speaker 5>How do you spell it?</v>

2419
01:06:21.671 --> 01:06:22.504
<v Speaker 5>G just.</v>

2420
01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:23.693
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2421
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:24.671
<v Speaker 5>grateful science.</v>

2422
01:06:24.671 --> 01:06:25.504
<v Speaker 5>My boy Chris,</v>

2423
01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:26.321
<v Speaker 5>he lives in La.</v>

2424
01:06:26.321 --> 01:06:27.041
<v Speaker 5>I'll hook you guys up.</v>

2425
01:06:27.041 --> 01:06:27.620
<v Speaker 5>He's the best.</v>

2426
01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:27.851
<v Speaker 5>I've.</v>

2427
01:06:27.851 --> 01:06:28.930
<v Speaker 5>I've used a lot of them.</v>

2428
01:06:28.931 --> 01:06:30.730
<v Speaker 5>Like the plume bypass is not bad,</v>

2429
01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:32.190
<v Speaker 5>but the g pen,</v>

2430
01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.480
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely my favorite so far.</v>

2431
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:37.280
<v Speaker 5>That's the one I use on the show all the time when we shoot on the west coat</v>

2432
01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.950
<v Speaker 5>shoot whenever we used the g pen.</v>

2433
01:06:39.090 --> 01:06:39.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2434
01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:40.060
<v Speaker 5>I want one so bad.</v>

2435
01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:40.630
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2436
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:41.650
<v Speaker 5>They taste amazing.</v>

2437
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:46.910
<v Speaker 5>The scientists out here that are concocting different ways to take your weed to</v>

2438
01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:48.580
<v Speaker 5>doing pretty amazing ways.</v>

2439
01:06:48.581 --> 01:06:49.630

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:28.610
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2462
01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:29.260
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:31.760
<v Speaker 5>fans like people will just bring it right.</v>

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.673
<v Speaker 5>Easily.</v>

2472
01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:44.830

2480
01:07:50.621 --> 01:07:52.360
<v Speaker 5>They bring me weed everywhere I go.</v>

2481
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:53.010
<v Speaker 5>That's fun.</v>

2482
01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:54.940
<v Speaker 5>That's the best thing about being a public public.</v>

2483
01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:57.040
<v Speaker 5>Publicly known president smokes weed.</v>

2484
01:07:57.041 --> 01:07:58.060
<v Speaker 5>People will hook you up.</v>

01:07:58.900 --> 01:07:59.440
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

2487
01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:01.450

2491
01:08:07.301 --> 01:08:07.691
<v Speaker 5>function.</v>

2492
01:08:07.691 --> 01:08:08.524
<v Speaker 5>I'm a functional.</v>

2493
01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:10.960
<v Speaker 5>We do function right,</v>

2494
01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:11.781
<v Speaker 5>but do you trust there?</v>

2495
01:08:11.781 --> 01:08:12.251
<v Speaker 5>We're like,</v>

2496
01:08:12.251 --> 01:08:14.470
<v Speaker 5>what if someone wants a lace you up?</v>

2497
01:08:14.471 --> 01:08:15.350
<v Speaker 5>It's no.</v>

2498
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Have you been late like me?</v>

2499
01:08:17.841 --> 01:08:18.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2500
01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.160
<v Speaker 1>but I know a person.</v>

2501
01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2502
01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:20.540
<v Speaker 1>One Dude.</v>

2503
01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2504
01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.430
<v Speaker 1>No one do see ICP.</v>

2505
01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Somebody put the PCP in this weed.</v>

2506
01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:25.640
<v Speaker 5>Well Damn.</v>

2507
01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:26.021
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2508
01:08:26.021 --> 01:08:26.870
<v Speaker 5>that's hardcore.</v>

2509
01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:29.330
<v Speaker 5>I've had a very bad situation I had.</v>

2510
01:08:29.331 --> 01:08:31.310
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't like a fan or anything,</v>

2511
01:08:31.311 --> 01:08:35.300
<v Speaker 5>but I had somebody give me weed once that was dipped in embalming fluid in that</v>

2512
01:08:35.301 --> 01:08:37.510
<v Speaker 5>really ruined my own Bama.</v>

2513
01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:37.671
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2514
01:08:37.671 --> 01:08:40.190
<v Speaker 5>that's what I feel like.</v>

2515
01:08:40.191 --> 01:08:42.320
<v Speaker 5>I feel like weed is such a friendly culture.</v>

2516
01:08:42.321 --> 01:08:43.760
<v Speaker 5>Like why would you do that to somebody?</v>

2517
01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Because people are broken.</v>

2518
01:08:45.130 --> 01:08:46.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean even the weeds are friendly culture.</v>

2519
01:08:46.781 --> 01:08:49.540
<v Speaker 1>There's certain amount of any culture that's going to be broken.</v>

2520
01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:49.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2521
01:08:49.881 --> 01:08:51.990
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are just unavoidably fucked up.</v>

2522
01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:54.220
<v Speaker 1>So you won't smoke weed people give you one tour?</v>

2523
01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2524
01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Not Anymore.</v>

2525
01:08:55.450 --> 01:08:56.200
<v Speaker 1>Not after that.</v>

2526
01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

2527
01:08:56.860 --> 01:09:01.630
<v Speaker 1>When I found out that there was a guy I told the story before but by a cop that</v>

2528
01:09:01.631 --> 01:09:05.050
<v Speaker 1>was asking me for Dmt in Cleveland and I knew it was a cop,</v>

2529
01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:05.891
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>

2530
01:09:05.891 --> 01:09:09.190
<v Speaker 1>It was the most obvious cop ever because some guy after a show by himself with a</v>

2531
01:09:09.191 --> 01:09:10.970
<v Speaker 1>crew cut asked me for details like,</v>

2532
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:11.291
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

2533
01:09:11.291 --> 01:09:12.490
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

2534
01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:14.860
<v Speaker 1>You really coming and asking me for illegal drug.</v>

2535
01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:15.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2536
01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:17.730
<v Speaker 5>The specific ask to.</v>

2537
01:09:17.830 --> 01:09:20.140
<v Speaker 5>It's a very specific flavor that you're asking.</v>

2538
01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.033
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2539
01:09:21.070 --> 01:09:23.410
<v Speaker 1>it's very specific when the problem is,</v>

2540
01:09:23.411 --> 01:09:24.810
<v Speaker 1>if every place was like California,</v>

2541
01:09:24.811 --> 01:09:24.911
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2542
01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:25.744
<v Speaker 1>it's smoking anybody,</v>

2543
01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:30.340
<v Speaker 1>but every place is not like California and there are places where it's super</v>

2544
01:09:30.341 --> 01:09:30.940
<v Speaker 1>illegal.</v>

2545
01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Like you get caught in Texas,</v>

2546
01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:33.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2547
01:09:33.391 --> 01:09:35.320
<v Speaker 1>like Willie Nelson got arrested in Texas.</v>

2548
01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:38.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you arrest Willie Nelson for pot,</v>

2549
01:09:38.231 --> 01:09:39.510
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking communist,</v>

2550
01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:39.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2551
01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:40.030

01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:40.661
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>

01:09:40.961 --> 01:09:41.210
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2555
01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:41.560
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2556
01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:41.920
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2557
01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:42.670
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking,</v>

2558
01:09:42.670 --> 01:09:43.503
<v Speaker 1>you're the enemy.</v>

2559
01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:44.250
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

2560
01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:46.640
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's pretty decriminalized in America I think in,</v>

2561
01:09:46.641 --> 01:09:47.820
<v Speaker 5>in the next five to 10.</v>

2562
01:09:47.821 --> 01:09:49.740
<v Speaker 5>Like weed is going to be like California everywhere.</v>

2563
01:09:49.770 --> 01:09:50.940
<v Speaker 5>There's still so many people in</v>

2564
01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:51.670
<v Speaker 1>jail though.</v>

2565
01:09:51.670 --> 01:09:53.660
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people in jail because of it.</v>

2566
01:09:53.661 --> 01:09:54.520
<v Speaker 1>And did they.</v>

2567

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Those guys in and let everybody out.</v>

2569
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:58.103
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2570
01:09:58.110 --> 01:09:59.520
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they're gonna they should,</v>

2571
01:09:59.521 --> 01:10:00.510
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think they will.</v>

2572
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:04.260
<v Speaker 5>The the laws in a lot of places like Phoenix,</v>

2573
01:10:04.290 --> 01:10:05.160
<v Speaker 5>it's real bad.</v>

01:10:05.370 --> 01:10:05.911
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's not good in taxes.</v>

2576
01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:09.330
<v Speaker 5>That's scaring a lot of places.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2584
01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:18.480
<v Speaker 5>five.</v>

2585
01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.070
<v Speaker 5>So I was Taiwan.</v>

2586
01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:21.480
<v Speaker 5>Taiwan was amazing.</v>

2587
01:10:21.481 --> 01:10:21.841
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>

2588
01:10:21.841 --> 01:10:23.610
<v Speaker 5>Taiwan is the best time.</v>

2589
01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:24.453
<v Speaker 5>One is the best.</v>

2590
01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:26.560
<v Speaker 5>What do you speak like?</v>

2591
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:28.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2592
01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:28.861
<v Speaker 5>I speak Mandarin.</v>

2593
01:10:28.861 --> 01:10:29.580
<v Speaker 5>Chinese.</v>

2594
01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:31.560
<v Speaker 5>Now if you're around Cantonese people,</v>

2595
01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:32.310
<v Speaker 5>what happens?</v>

2596
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:33.750
<v Speaker 5>I can't understand what they're saying.</v>

2597
01:10:34.170 --> 01:10:36.180
<v Speaker 5>It sounds like they're playing Chinese through guitar.</v>

2598
01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:38.430
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2599
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:39.780
<v Speaker 5>I got mad cantonese homies,</v>

2600
01:10:39.781 --> 01:10:40.081
<v Speaker 5>but no,</v>

2601
01:10:40.081 --> 01:10:42.750
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand Cantonese and they barely understand mandarin.</v>

2602
01:10:42.751 --> 01:10:43.290
<v Speaker 5>It's tough.</v>

2603
01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:44.030
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2604
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.510
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2605
01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:46.830
<v Speaker 5>It's not just north and south like you got an accent.</v>

2606
01:10:46.831 --> 01:10:48.780
<v Speaker 5>It's like really some extra tone.</v>

2607
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:49.890
<v Speaker 5>This read it.</v>

2608
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:51.870
<v Speaker 5>I can read some things.</v>

2609
01:10:51.871 --> 01:10:55.500
<v Speaker 5>I know a few words I probably read on like a kindergarten level and I speak on</v>

2610
01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:56.191
<v Speaker 5>like a fifth grade,</v>

2611
01:10:56.191 --> 01:10:57.024
<v Speaker 5>sixth grade level,</v>

2612
01:10:57.150 --> 01:10:58.290
<v Speaker 5>but you speak in a fifth grade,</v>

2613
01:10:58.291 --> 01:10:58.981
<v Speaker 5>sixth grade level.</v>

2614
01:10:58.981 --> 01:11:03.810
<v Speaker 5>Just because you know some of it not because it's across the board.</v>

2615
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.910
<v Speaker 5>Oh No.</v>

2616
01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:05.521
<v Speaker 5>Cantonese?</v>

2617
01:11:05.521 --> 01:11:05.641
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

2618
01:11:05.641 --> 01:11:07.020
<v Speaker 5>I don't know shit about Cantonese,</v>

2619
01:11:07.021 --> 01:11:08.280
<v Speaker 5>but the written is the same.</v>

2620
01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:09.890
<v Speaker 5>Or written language is the same.</v>

2621
01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:12.810
<v Speaker 5>He's written the written Cantonese is the same.</v>

2622
01:11:12.811 --> 01:11:13.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2623
01:11:13.290 --> 01:11:13.501
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2624
01:11:13.501 --> 01:11:14.101
<v Speaker 5>fascinating.</v>

2625
01:11:14.101 --> 01:11:14.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2626
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:15.301
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2627
01:11:15.301 --> 01:11:16.980
<v Speaker 5>but the way they say it is different.</v>

2628
01:11:17.010 --> 01:11:18.000
<v Speaker 5>Cantonese and Mandarin.</v>

2629
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:19.710
<v Speaker 5>So you can read all Cantonese.</v>

2630
01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.550
<v Speaker 5>No problem.</v>

2631
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:21.900
<v Speaker 5>I think it's the same characters.</v>

2632
01:11:21.901 --> 01:11:23.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure it's the same case.</v>

2633
01:11:23.081 --> 01:11:24.090
<v Speaker 5>So how the fuck is it?</v>

2634
01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:25.410
<v Speaker 5>A different language?</v>

2635
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:26.490
<v Speaker 5>It's another tone.</v>

2636
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.110
<v Speaker 5>They have another tone when they speak it.</v>

2637
01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:29.371
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

2638
01:11:29.371 --> 01:11:29.960
<v Speaker 5>That's weird.</v>

2639
01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:30.930
<v Speaker 5>That's insanity.</v>

2640
01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:31.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2641
01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:32.370
<v Speaker 5>What does it sound like?</v>

2642
01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:33.360
<v Speaker 5>Like what's the difference?</v>

2643
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:34.230
<v Speaker 5>Can you tell me the difference?</v>

2644
01:11:34.231 --> 01:11:34.890
<v Speaker 5>Can you like,</v>

2645
01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:35.940
<v Speaker 5>give me like a sentence?</v>

2646
01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:37.860
<v Speaker 5>The lomea like they say stuff.</v>

2647
01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:38.940
<v Speaker 5>It's bouncier.</v>

2648
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.070
<v Speaker 5>It sounds bouncier without like,</v>

2649
01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.870
<v Speaker 5>without being racist and making fun of it.</v>

2650
01:11:42.871 --> 01:11:43.051
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2651
01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:45.650
<v Speaker 5>it just sounds to me like you're allowed to make fun.</v>

2652
01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:46.470
<v Speaker 5>You're Chinese.</v>

2653
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:47.400
<v Speaker 5>You can let it slide,</v>

2654
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:49.100
<v Speaker 5>but like a no.</v>

2655
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.943
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

2656
01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:51.300
<v Speaker 5>I'm not even saying words,</v>

2657
01:11:51.301 --> 01:11:53.340
<v Speaker 5>but I'm just imitating the sound like a,</v>

2658
01:11:53.690 --> 01:11:54.523
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2659
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:55.890
<v Speaker 5>a thing don't die.</v>

2660
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:58.410
<v Speaker 5>They're like super bouncy that way,</v>

2661
01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:01.170
<v Speaker 5>but it's different than managing in what way?</v>

2662
01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:03.480
<v Speaker 5>What's confused me is fifth tone.</v>

2663
01:12:04.150 --> 01:12:05.130
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

2664
01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:06.990
<v Speaker 5>But the characters are the same,</v>

2665
01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:10.740
<v Speaker 5>but they have a different sound for the characters.</v>

2666
01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:11.633
<v Speaker 5>Is that what it is?</v>

2667
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:13.050
<v Speaker 5>Which is kinda crazy.</v>

2668
01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:14.003
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2669
01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:15.330
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>

2670
01:12:15.390 --> 01:12:17.670
<v Speaker 1>you like one person would say shoe,</v>

2671
01:12:17.730 --> 01:12:20.430
<v Speaker 1>they would have a totally different noise for it,</v>

2672
01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:22.080
<v Speaker 1>but if you wrote it down,</v>

2673
01:12:22.081 --> 01:12:22.970
<v Speaker 1>you both saw shoe.</v>

2674
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2675
01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2676
01:12:24.330 --> 01:12:25.200
<v Speaker 1>You're blowing my mind.</v>

2677
01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:27.083
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2678
01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:29.910
<v Speaker 5>How many people are on it will check this and make sure.</v>

2679
01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:31.890
<v Speaker 5>I mean we can check this and make sure,</v>

2680
01:12:31.891 --> 01:12:33.540
<v Speaker 5>but I'm almost positive that it is.</v>

2681
01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.460
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty positive it is the same language.</v>

2682
01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.430
<v Speaker 5>How many people were on each like,</v>

2683
01:12:38.431 --> 01:12:40.450
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a million commandment.</v>

2684
01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:40.770
<v Speaker 5>Much,</v>

2685
01:12:40.770 --> 01:12:42.570
<v Speaker 5>much more speaking mandarin and Cantonese.</v>

2686
01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:46.560
<v Speaker 5>How much more Cantonese is just like the southeast of China and Hong Kong.</v>

2687
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:47.623
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2688
01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:49.170
<v Speaker 5>How the fuck does that ever happen?</v>

2689
01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.073
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2690
01:12:51.150 --> 01:12:54.810
<v Speaker 5>they just lost the war because some Mongo type shit.</v>

2691
01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:57.913
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>

2692
01:12:58.200 --> 01:12:58.760
<v Speaker 5>that's good.</v>

2693
01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:02.760
<v Speaker 1>So the whole idea of a billion people on a continent is a fucking trip,</v>

2694
01:13:02.761 --> 01:13:03.370
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2695
01:13:03.370 --> 01:13:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2696
01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.320
<v Speaker 1>And did it.</v>

2697
01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Did.</v>

2698
01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:10.410
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even a billion people on the whole planet just a little while ago.</v>

2699
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:11.491
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2700
01:13:11.491 --> 01:13:11.791
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2701
01:13:11.791 --> 01:13:15.060
<v Speaker 5>we are way too good at making babies and that's why they're trying to limit it.</v>

2702
01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:16.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2703
01:13:16.031 --> 01:13:19.270
<v Speaker 1>My Friend Duncan actually have funny thing that he said yesterday that some</v>

2704
01:13:19.271 --> 01:13:24.271
<v Speaker 1>people believe that this is such an amazing time to be alive,</v>

2705
01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:28.540
<v Speaker 1>that so many souls are trying to reincarnate to this time.</v>

2706
01:13:28.541 --> 01:13:30.130
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's so many people on the planet.</v>

2707
01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:31.210
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2708
01:13:31.210 --> 01:13:31.481
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2709
01:13:31.481 --> 01:13:32.410
<v Speaker 5>So they say here,</v>

2710
01:13:32.411 --> 01:13:36.130
<v Speaker 5>written Cantonese is the most highly developed written form of all Chinese</v>

2711
01:13:36.131 --> 01:13:40.630
<v Speaker 5>varieties apart from standard mandarin and classical standard written Chinese is</v>

2712
01:13:40.631 --> 01:13:41.320
<v Speaker 5>based on manner,</v>

2713
01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.300
<v Speaker 5>but when spoken word for word as Cantonese,</v>

2714
01:13:43.301 --> 01:13:48.250
<v Speaker 5>it sounds unnatural because it's expressions or ungrammatical in an idiomatic in</v>

2715
01:13:48.251 --> 01:13:49.084
<v Speaker 5>Cantonese.</v>

2716
01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:52.440
<v Speaker 5>So Cantonese speakers have developed their own written scripts,</v>

2717
01:13:52.441 --> 01:13:55.900
<v Speaker 5>sometimes creating new characters for words that either do not exist or have</v>

2718
01:13:55.901 --> 01:13:57.190
<v Speaker 5>been lost in standard Chinese.</v>

2719
01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.500
<v Speaker 5>But basically it's based on the same language.</v>

2720
01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:00.460
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

2721
01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:01.780
<v Speaker 5>It's just more refined.</v>

2722
01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:02.280
<v Speaker 5>That'd be weird.</v>

2723
01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:07.280
<v Speaker 5>Trying to speak English and just speak it differently with using the same words.</v>

2724
01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:09.013
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2725
01:14:09.930 --> 01:14:10.763
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2726
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:13.260

2802
01:16:18.301 --> 01:16:19.560
<v Speaker 3>Some work that you have to do.</v>

2803
01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:20.700
<v Speaker 3>It's fucked up.</v>

2804
01:16:20.701 --> 01:16:20.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2805
01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:21.200

2807
01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Even something as amazing as Ted,</v>

2808
01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:27.740
<v Speaker 1>because Ted,</v>

2809
01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:32.270
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first Ted talk that I ever saw on the Internet a couple of years</v>

2810
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.420
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

2812
01:16:35.650 --> 01:16:37.400
<v Speaker 1>A great ted episodes,</v>

2813
01:16:37.570 --> 01:16:39.170
<v Speaker 1>like the one how to be happy is great.</v>

2814
01:16:39.230 --> 01:16:39.501
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2815
01:16:39.501 --> 01:16:40.790
<v Speaker 1>there's so many of them are.</v>

2816
01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Graham Hancock just gave one of the war and consciousness about Iowasca and in</v>

2817
01:16:46.371 --> 01:16:49.640
<v Speaker 1>his own problems with kicking cannabis.</v>

2818
01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:54.530
<v Speaker 1>He had like a crazy weed habit where he's high all day every day for like</v>

2819
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:54.710
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>

2820
01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:55.231
<v Speaker 1>And then he liked.</v>

2821
01:16:55.231 --> 01:16:55.461
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

2822
01:16:55.461 --> 01:16:56.360
<v Speaker 1>it was a crutch forum.</v>

2823
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:57.380
<v Speaker 1>It was like a real problem.</v>

2824
01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2825
01:16:58.250 --> 01:16:59.540
<v Speaker 1>great ted talk about it though.</v>

2826
01:16:59.541 --> 01:17:00.680
<v Speaker 1>There's so much good stuff,</v>

2827
01:17:00.681 --> 01:17:02.750
<v Speaker 1>but then you hear shit like this and you're like,</v>

2828
01:17:03.650 --> 01:17:04.580
<v Speaker 1>even they suck.</v>

2829
01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Like even someone finds a way to fuck up.</v>

2830
01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Even something as amazing as tad.</v>

2831
01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 1>The speakers</v>

2832
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.580
<v Speaker 5>are great.</v>

2833
01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:11.090
<v Speaker 5>I quit.</v>

2834
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:12.590
<v Speaker 5>I can't say damn bad thing.</v>

2835
01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:15.080
<v Speaker 5>Every single one of the fellows is like inspirational,</v>

2836
01:17:15.081 --> 01:17:15.501
<v Speaker 5>amazing,</v>

2837
01:17:15.501 --> 01:17:16.334
<v Speaker 5>doing great work.</v>

2838
01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.790
<v Speaker 5>The thing is that something gets so good and people feel the power that they</v>

2839
01:17:19.791 --> 01:17:23.270
<v Speaker 5>have and then they impose rules and that's how society got created in the</v>

2840
01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:23.990
<v Speaker 5>beginning.</v>

2841
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:27.800
<v Speaker 5>Somebody got so liked and got so much power that they could force you to do</v>

2842
01:17:27.801 --> 01:17:29.930
<v Speaker 5>things that were entirely unnatural and inhuman.</v>

2843
01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:34.700
<v Speaker 5>That's so ridiculous to think that a guy like you who's as busy as you could</v>

2844
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:39.790
<v Speaker 5>give up that much time and be angry if you vary from their schedule at all.</v>

2845
01:17:41.211 --> 01:17:42.330
<v Speaker 5>That that sounds like more.</v>

2846
01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:43.990
<v Speaker 5>I think Ted's a racist</v>

2847
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:48.920
<v Speaker 5>culturally kind of crazy too because other people missed and they kind of picked</v>

2848
01:17:48.921 --> 01:17:49.451
<v Speaker 5>on me for it,</v>

2849
01:17:49.451 --> 01:17:51.080
<v Speaker 5>but even before I got out and I was like,</v>

2850
01:17:51.081 --> 01:17:51.231
<v Speaker 5>Yo,</v>

2851

01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:53.780
<v Speaker 5>You want me to stay till Saturday?</v>

2853
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:57.600
<v Speaker 5>Can I at least have my girls stay with me and I'll just use the room.</v>

2854
01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:57.950
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2855
01:17:57.950 --> 01:18:00.240
<v Speaker 5>oh we can't because you have a roommate at Ted,</v>

2856
01:18:00.241 --> 01:18:01.011
<v Speaker 5>so you're like 30,</v>

2857
01:18:01.011 --> 01:18:03.470

2858
01:18:03.471 --> 01:18:04.160
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2859
01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:04.993
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute.</v>

2860
01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:07.000
<v Speaker 5>They make you room with people.</v>

2861
01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:07.580
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

2862
01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:07.910
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

2863
01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:08.780
<v Speaker 5>How can they do that?</v>

2864
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:10.400
<v Speaker 5>Tell you who to sleep with.</v>

2865
01:18:10.420 --> 01:18:10.621
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2866
01:18:10.621 --> 01:18:10.971
<v Speaker 5>they were.</v>

2867
01:18:10.971 --> 01:18:11.630

2907
01:19:17.001 --> 01:19:18.920
<v Speaker 5>But the whole thing is just weird.</v>

2908
01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:19.340
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2909

<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2914
01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:25.070
<v Speaker 5>you're not allowed to pay for your own room.</v>

2915
01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:25.610
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2916
01:19:25.610 --> 01:19:26.510
<v Speaker 5>they're crazy.</v>

2917
01:19:26.511 --> 01:19:27.800
<v Speaker 5>They just want to control you.</v>

2918
01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:29.030
<v Speaker 5>That is amazing.</v>

2919
01:19:29.031 --> 01:19:30.140
<v Speaker 5>So I still love the talks.</v>

2920
01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:31.160
<v Speaker 5>I love all the speakers,</v>

2921
01:19:31.161 --> 01:19:33.140
<v Speaker 5>but the organization is fucked.</v>

2922
01:19:33.170 --> 01:19:36.560
<v Speaker 5>That's hilarious that they think that they can have that kind of influence over</v>

2923
01:19:36.561 --> 01:19:36.970
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

2924
01:19:36.970 --> 01:19:40.040
<v Speaker 5>It's part of the Ted experience as part of the Ted experience.</v>

2925
01:19:40.170 --> 01:19:41.670
<v Speaker 5>It's part of the Ted experience.</v>

2926
01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:46.250
<v Speaker 5>No one's talked about this before because this seems like straight up boy</v>

2927
01:19:46.251 --> 01:19:46.761
<v Speaker 5>scouts.</v>

2928
01:19:46.761 --> 01:19:47.120
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2929
01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:49.700
<v Speaker 5>You know what is the thing is most people they need 10.</v>

2930
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:51.200
<v Speaker 5>They need to put you on.</v>

2931
01:19:51.201 --> 01:19:54.230
<v Speaker 5>They want the coastline and most people it's like if you do something for me,</v>

2932
01:19:54.231 --> 01:19:55.310
<v Speaker 5>I won't say anything about you,</v>

2933
01:19:55.311 --> 01:19:56.150
<v Speaker 5>but that's.</v>

2934
01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:56.421
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2935
01:19:56.421 --> 01:19:56.931
<v Speaker 5>I think Joe,</v>

2936
01:19:56.931 --> 01:19:57.764
<v Speaker 5>you're the same way.</v>

2937
01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:59.240
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck what you do for me.</v>

2938
01:19:59.270 --> 01:20:03.980
<v Speaker 5>If you're a fucking Weirdo and you're about to start some new coat conference,</v>

2939
01:20:03.981 --> 01:20:04.490
<v Speaker 5>religion,</v>

2940
01:20:04.490 --> 01:20:05.330
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to say something.</v>

2941
01:20:05.670 --> 01:20:06.920
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to follow your rules.</v>

2942
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:09.810
<v Speaker 5>I would write a book about this by trade.</v>

2943
01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:13.320
<v Speaker 5>They actually tried to get me to do what they wanted me to do for four,</v>

2944
01:20:13.710 --> 01:20:14.160
<v Speaker 5>five,</v>

2945
01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:14.461
<v Speaker 5>six,</v>

2946
01:20:14.461 --> 01:20:14.941
<v Speaker 5>seven days,</v>

2947
01:20:14.941 --> 01:20:15.750
<v Speaker 5>whatever it was,</v>

2948
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:16.830
<v Speaker 5>and not paying you.</v>

2949
01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:18.570
<v Speaker 5>They send packets to to be like,</v>

2950
01:20:18.571 --> 01:20:20.340
<v Speaker 5>this is how to network with billionaires.</v>

2951
01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:23.940
<v Speaker 5>Like how to go to work with billionaires,</v>

2952
01:20:23.941 --> 01:20:28.050
<v Speaker 5>how to go to a network and talk to people and talk to potential people who could</v>

2953
01:20:28.051 --> 01:20:29.130
<v Speaker 5>collaborate and work with you.</v>

2954
01:20:29.131 --> 01:20:29.640
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

2955
01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.380
<v Speaker 5>don't just go ask them for money.</v>

2956
01:20:31.381 --> 01:20:31.890
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>

2957
01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:32.820
<v Speaker 5>this is crazy.</v>

2958
01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:33.631
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

2959
01:20:33.631 --> 01:20:38.631
<v Speaker 5>I'm so go ask them for money and it's in the packets and you're a grown ass man</v>

2960
01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:41.700
<v Speaker 5>and they pick you like you're obviously intelligent if you're getting picked for</v>

2961
01:20:41.701 --> 01:20:42.780
<v Speaker 5>10 and they're like,</v>

2962
01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:44.250
<v Speaker 5>today when it rains,</v>

2963
01:20:44.251 --> 01:20:45.210
<v Speaker 5>you should pack a punch.</v>

2964
01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:46.020
<v Speaker 5>It's wild.</v>

2965
01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:46.201
<v Speaker 5>See?</v>

2966
01:20:46.201 --> 01:20:46.620
<v Speaker 5>That would.</v>

2967
01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:47.620
<v Speaker 5>That is hard.</v>

2968
01:20:47.621 --> 01:20:47.880
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2969
01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:52.620
<v Speaker 5>What that is is exactly the opposite of the vehicle that got them there and the</v>

2970
01:20:52.621 --> 01:20:54.930
<v Speaker 5>vehicle that got them there is the Internet.</v>

2971
01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:55.331
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>

2972
01:20:55.331 --> 01:20:58.650
<v Speaker 5>What got them there is the fact that the freedom of the Internet allows people</v>

2973
01:20:58.651 --> 01:21:01.140
<v Speaker 5>to exchange interesting conversations like that,</v>

2974
01:21:01.141 --> 01:21:01.321
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2975
01:21:01.321 --> 01:21:01.700
<v Speaker 5>you gotta,</v>

2976
01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:02.251
<v Speaker 5>listen to this.</v>

2977
01:21:02.251 --> 01:21:02.891
<v Speaker 5>You gotta wash us.</v>

2978
01:21:02.891 --> 01:21:04.560
<v Speaker 5>This lady gave the speech on monkeys.</v>

2979
01:21:04.561 --> 01:21:05.251
<v Speaker 5>It was amazing.</v>

2980
01:21:05.251 --> 01:21:06.084
<v Speaker 5>Whatever.</v>

2981
01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:10.490
<v Speaker 5>And what they did is the exact opposite of that and that's why even though Obama</v>

2982
01:21:10.491 --> 01:21:11.730
<v Speaker 5>is focusing on gun control,</v>

2983
01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:15.060
<v Speaker 5>the most important debate that Americans will face in the next five years is</v>

2984
01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:15.953
<v Speaker 5>internet freedom.</v>

2985
01:21:16.290 --> 01:21:19.140
<v Speaker 5>Internet freedom is the most important debate we will face.</v>

2986
01:21:19.141 --> 01:21:23.340
<v Speaker 5>And we hurt so fucking blind to it because the lobbyists are doing it under like</v>

2987
01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:24.413
<v Speaker 5>under our noses.</v>

2988
01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:24.581
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2989
01:21:24.581 --> 01:21:24.850
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

2990
01:21:24.850 --> 01:21:29.850
<v Speaker 5>you surely should have the right and ability to put your own website up and</v>

2991
01:21:30.061 --> 01:21:32.620
<v Speaker 5>control your own content and express yourself in any,</v>

2992
01:21:32.630 --> 01:21:33.271
<v Speaker 5>in any way,</v>

2993
01:21:33.271 --> 01:21:34.830
<v Speaker 5>shape form you choose.</v>

2994
01:21:35.100 --> 01:21:40.100
<v Speaker 5>And the benefits of that have been staggering to our culture over the last</v>

2995
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:40.850
<v Speaker 5>couple of years.</v>

2996
01:21:40.850 --> 01:21:41.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2997
01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:42.480
<v Speaker 5>just just over the last 10,</v>

2998
01:21:42.930 --> 01:21:43.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2999
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:48.350
<v Speaker 5>and the idea that corporations might have the ability to step in and stop that</v>

3000
01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:54.440
<v Speaker 5>or regulate that or restrict that or sensor you if in anything that you do and</v>

3001
01:21:54.691 --> 01:21:55.524
<v Speaker 5>somehow or another,</v>

3002
01:21:55.620 --> 01:22:00.360
<v Speaker 5>if anything you do and somehow or another a one way or a forms cost them money</v>

3003
01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:03.120
<v Speaker 5>and they decide that this is something that has to be stopped.</v>

3004
01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:04.740
<v Speaker 5>They're going to be able to do that.</v>

3005
01:22:04.770 --> 01:22:08.580
<v Speaker 5>Unless West we do something and when somebody realizes they have their hand on</v>

3006
01:22:08.581 --> 01:22:11.220
<v Speaker 5>the faucet and they have the ability to turn it on and turn it off,</v>

3007
01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:12.240
<v Speaker 5>people get crazy.</v>

3008
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:13.170
<v Speaker 5>You've seen that study.</v>

3009
01:22:13.171 --> 01:22:13.710
<v Speaker 5>It's like Ted,</v>

3010
01:22:13.710 --> 01:22:16.340
<v Speaker 5>like these 10 people power.</v>

3011
01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:16.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3012
01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:20.190
<v Speaker 5>They do this shit where they invite these people to go talk and they actually</v>

3013
01:22:20.191 --> 01:22:22.530
<v Speaker 5>don't put up everybody's talks until this year.</v>

3014
01:22:22.770 --> 01:22:26.790
<v Speaker 5>They used to pick and choose and cherry pick the talks they put up and you would</v>

3015
01:22:26.791 --> 01:22:27.840
<v Speaker 5>go there for a week,</v>

3016
01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:29.310
<v Speaker 5>15 hours a day,</v>

3017
01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:32.910
<v Speaker 5>do all their shit and then imagine if they didn't put up your talk.</v>

3018
01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:34.020
<v Speaker 5>But what have you talked socks.</v>

3019
01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.310
<v Speaker 5>If you're talk sucked,</v>

3020
01:22:35.311 --> 01:22:39.300
<v Speaker 5>I feel like it should just go suck on the internet or on the Internet,</v>

3021
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.870
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

3022
01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:40.291
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3023
01:22:40.291 --> 01:22:42.480
<v Speaker 5>But maybe yes and no,</v>

3024
01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.433
<v Speaker 5>because if,</v>

3025
01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:47.690
<v Speaker 5>if you say if you had a comedy conference and uh,</v>

3026
01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:49.350
<v Speaker 5>you had all these comedians do sets,</v>

3027
01:22:49.351 --> 01:22:50.880
<v Speaker 5>but some of them were just dog shit.</v>

3028
01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:54.120
<v Speaker 5>You want that set to represent your,</v>

3029
01:22:54.121 --> 01:22:54.871
<v Speaker 5>your company?</v>

3030
01:22:54.871 --> 01:22:55.221
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3031
01:22:55.221 --> 01:22:55.620
<v Speaker 5>you would.</v>

3032
01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:56.453
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3033
01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:57.473
<v Speaker 5>you wouldn't do it.</v>

3034
01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:57.830
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3035
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:58.663
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't,</v>

3036
01:22:59.100 --> 01:22:59.461
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3037
01:22:59.461 --> 01:23:00.350
<v Speaker 5>if I did though,</v>

3038
01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.360
<v Speaker 5>invite someone and they stayed for a week and I didn't pay them,</v>

3039
01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:03.991
<v Speaker 5>I would be like,</v>

3040
01:23:03.991 --> 01:23:07.720
<v Speaker 5>the least I owe you is opportunity that quite possibly there's three people on</v>

3041
01:23:07.721 --> 01:23:09.330
<v Speaker 5>the planet or at that enjoy your son.</v>

3042
01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.070
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3043
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.370
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3044
01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:11.380
<v Speaker 5>That's one point.</v>

3045
01:23:11.381 --> 01:23:11.591
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3046
01:23:11.591 --> 01:23:12.191
<v Speaker 5>that's a point.</v>

3047
01:23:12.191 --> 01:23:13.420
<v Speaker 5>I guess if I know what you're saying,</v>

3048
01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:14.201
<v Speaker 5>to protect the brand,</v>

3049
01:23:14.201 --> 01:23:15.100
<v Speaker 5>it makes a little sense,</v>

3050
01:23:15.101 --> 01:23:15.970
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3051
01:23:15.971 --> 01:23:16.631
<v Speaker 5>for the most part,</v>

3052
01:23:16.631 --> 01:23:18.160
<v Speaker 5>most people's talks are fucking good.</v>

3053
01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:18.541
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3054
01:23:18.541 --> 01:23:19.480
<v Speaker 5>They're there for a reason,</v>

3055
01:23:19.481 --> 01:23:23.260
<v Speaker 5>so it's probably really different than going to get an open miker Ted Talker,</v>

3056
01:23:23.530 --> 01:23:25.040
<v Speaker 5>but it's not a bringer show here.</v>

3057
01:23:25.041 --> 01:23:25.660
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3058
01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:28.300
<v Speaker 5>But they give opportunities to a lot of weird people mean it.</v>

3059
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:29.590
<v Speaker 5>It's absolutely possible.</v>

3060
01:23:29.591 --> 01:23:30.424
<v Speaker 5>There must be.</v>

3061
01:23:30.460 --> 01:23:32.080
<v Speaker 5>I bet if we just ask a bit,</v>

3062
01:23:32.081 --> 01:23:32.831
<v Speaker 5>we're ignorant to it,</v>

3063
01:23:32.831 --> 01:23:33.640
<v Speaker 5>but we just say,</v>

3064
01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:34.750
<v Speaker 5>show me the Ted talks.</v>

3065
01:23:34.751 --> 01:23:35.870
<v Speaker 5>That sucker fat Dick.</v>

3066
01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:37.811
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3067
01:23:37.811 --> 01:23:38.470
<v Speaker 5>Twitter,</v>

3068
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:39.161
<v Speaker 5>twitter people,</v>

3069
01:23:39.161 --> 01:23:44.080

3070
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:44.081
<v Speaker 5>Silverman.</v>

3071
01:23:44.081 --> 01:23:44.740
<v Speaker 5>Ted Talk.</v>

3072
01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:45.790
<v Speaker 5>There was never let out.</v>

3073
01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:46.480
<v Speaker 5>She gave.</v>

3074
01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.560
<v Speaker 5>She gave us never let happen.</v>

3075
01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:47.990
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3076
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:49.840
<v Speaker 5>they never let it out because she made fun of Ted.</v>

3077
01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:50.501
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

3078
01:23:50.501 --> 01:23:52.570
<v Speaker 5>I would've fucking wanted to watch that immediate.</v>

3079
01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:53.050
<v Speaker 5>Really.</v>

3080
01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:53.591
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is,</v>

3081
01:23:53.591 --> 01:23:55.140
<v Speaker 5>if you're confident in is that you're allowed,</v>

3082
01:23:55.410 --> 01:23:56.350
<v Speaker 5>you can laugh at yourself.</v>

3083
01:23:56.351 --> 01:23:57.750
<v Speaker 5>They don't know how to laugh at themselves.</v>

3084
01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:58.571
<v Speaker 5>She made fun of Ted.</v>

3085
01:23:58.571 --> 01:23:59.350
<v Speaker 5>In what way?</v>

3086
01:23:59.350 --> 01:24:00.400
<v Speaker 5>Like during her talk,</v>

3087
01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:01.960
<v Speaker 5>it's like the mythology of it.</v>

3088
01:24:01.961 --> 01:24:03.400
<v Speaker 5>I didn't see the talk obviously,</v>

3089
01:24:03.401 --> 01:24:05.320
<v Speaker 5>but was the Sarah Silverman Ted talk?</v>

3090
01:24:05.321 --> 01:24:06.154
<v Speaker 5>They never let out.</v>

3091
01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:07.120
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3092
01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:07.880
<v Speaker 5>We need to get serious.</v>

3093
01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:08.713
<v Speaker 5>I</v>

3094
01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:11.050
<v Speaker 5>need to run into her somewhere.</v>

3095
01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:11.560
<v Speaker 5>I could.</v>

3096
01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:12.393
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't make it happen.</v>

3097
01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:12.581
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3098
01:24:12.581 --> 01:24:13.414
<v Speaker 5>Am I going to happen her?</v>

3099
01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:13.901
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3100
01:24:13.901 --> 01:24:14.734
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3101
01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.620
<v Speaker 5>I've never heard anything bad about ted before,</v>

3102
01:24:17.710 --> 01:24:19.540
<v Speaker 5>so that's why this is such a shock.</v>

3103
01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:20.590
<v Speaker 5>It is weird though.</v>

3104
01:24:20.591 --> 01:24:23.890
<v Speaker 5>You meet the donors and stuff and they can't tell Asian people apart.</v>

3105
01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:26.260
<v Speaker 5>They can't tell African people apart and it's just,</v>

3106
01:24:26.290 --> 01:24:27.250
<v Speaker 5>it's weird man.</v>

3107
01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:29.320
<v Speaker 5>They're nice and everybody means well.</v>

3108
01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:30.580
<v Speaker 5>Did they call you David Choe?</v>

3109
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:33.090
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3110
01:24:33.090 --> 01:24:37.240
<v Speaker 5>They mistake you for other fellows because so many of them are Asian.</v>

3111
01:24:37.690 --> 01:24:38.260
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

3112
01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:38.831
<v Speaker 5>That's funny.</v>

3113
01:24:38.831 --> 01:24:39.490
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3114
01:24:39.490 --> 01:24:41.350
<v Speaker 5>How many different people do it every year?</v>

3115
01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:45.160
<v Speaker 5>Every year they pick like 20 fellows and then they pick a bunch of other people</v>

3116
01:24:45.161 --> 01:24:46.060
<v Speaker 5>for the main stage.</v>

3117
01:24:46.061 --> 01:24:47.170
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

3118
01:24:47.230 --> 01:24:47.471
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3119
01:24:47.471 --> 01:24:48.304
<v Speaker 5>no it is.</v>

3120
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:49.810
<v Speaker 5>It is a ill organization.</v>

3121
01:24:49.811 --> 01:24:50.171
<v Speaker 5>I still,</v>

3122
01:24:50.171 --> 01:24:51.430
<v Speaker 5>even though they booted me today,</v>

3123
01:24:51.431 --> 01:24:51.940
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3124
01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:52.960
<v Speaker 5>I love the speakers.</v>

3125
01:24:53.050 --> 01:24:55.090
<v Speaker 5>I love the talks and I want it to continue,</v>

3126
01:24:55.091 --> 01:24:56.410
<v Speaker 5>but I hope that they,</v>

3127
01:24:56.411 --> 01:24:57.180
<v Speaker 5>at least,</v>

3128
01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:57.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3129
01:24:57.490 --> 01:24:59.140
<v Speaker 5>they could say I suck and that's fine.</v>

3130
01:24:59.141 --> 01:24:59.531
<v Speaker 5>They can be like,</v>

3131
01:24:59.531 --> 01:25:00.340
<v Speaker 5>Eddie's a shithead.</v>

3132
01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:01.091
<v Speaker 5>He went to la,</v>

3133
01:25:01.091 --> 01:25:03.040
<v Speaker 5>he did the fucking podcast and he sucks,</v>

3134
01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:05.590
<v Speaker 5>but I hope they just changed the rules for future people.</v>

3135
01:25:05.591 --> 01:25:07.080
<v Speaker 5>So there's something you didn't do anything wrong.</v>

3136
01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:12.150
<v Speaker 5>They're crazy and all they represent is a distribution method for the greatest</v>

3137
01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:13.840
<v Speaker 5>minds on earth.</v>

3138
01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.040
<v Speaker 5>That's all they represent.</v>

3139
01:25:15.220 --> 01:25:17.170
<v Speaker 5>It's not the baby are the greatest minds on earth.</v>

3140
01:25:17.290 --> 01:25:19.750
<v Speaker 5>It's just there's so many interesting people today.</v>

3141
01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:23.380
<v Speaker 5>We live in an amazing time and just when you good,</v>

3142
01:25:23.381 --> 01:25:24.520
<v Speaker 5>something like Ted,</v>

3143
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:26.590
<v Speaker 5>whatever that Ted stands for,</v>

3144
01:25:26.770 --> 01:25:29.740
<v Speaker 5>it became synonymous on the Internet with fascinating talks.</v>

3145
01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:30.850
<v Speaker 5>Boom.</v>

3146
01:25:30.850 --> 01:25:31.683
<v Speaker 5>And then it's off.</v>

3147
01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:32.593
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3148
01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:34.740
<v Speaker 5>You could do the Eddie Wong's,</v>

3149
01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:35.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3150
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:36.161
<v Speaker 5>fascinating.</v>

3151
01:25:36.161 --> 01:25:39.250
<v Speaker 5>Motherfuckers on bias and do the exact same thing.</v>

3152
01:25:39.251 --> 01:25:39.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3153
01:25:39.670 --> 01:25:43.540
<v Speaker 5>I think there's a lot of room for that because conferences like I would love to</v>

3154
01:25:43.570 --> 01:25:45.910
<v Speaker 5>hear more people from downtown La,</v>

3155
01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:48.640
<v Speaker 5>downtown New York and talking and doing these ideas because they don't find</v>

3156
01:25:48.641 --> 01:25:49.091
<v Speaker 5>those dudes.</v>

3157
01:25:49.091 --> 01:25:50.140
<v Speaker 5>They find academics,</v>

3158
01:25:50.410 --> 01:25:52.240
<v Speaker 5>they find people playing ancient instruments.</v>

3159
01:25:52.241 --> 01:25:53.560
<v Speaker 5>They find people that are,</v>

3160
01:25:53.561 --> 01:25:53.980
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3161
01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:55.240
<v Speaker 5>working nature things and,</v>

3162
01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:57.670
<v Speaker 5>and they have their kind of like cultural sect,</v>

3163
01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.510
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3164
01:25:58.510 --> 01:26:01.080
<v Speaker 5>but there is a lot of room to find genius and other places,</v>

3165
01:26:01.170 --> 01:26:02.470
<v Speaker 5>geniuses everywhere you know this,</v>

3166
01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:03.800
<v Speaker 5>you travel around the world,</v>

3167
01:26:03.801 --> 01:26:05.090
<v Speaker 5>you find genius anywhere.</v>

3168
01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:08.870
<v Speaker 5>So there's room for conferences that like look under different cultures because</v>

3169
01:26:08.871 --> 01:26:10.850
<v Speaker 5>they're kind of looking under the same stones all the time.</v>

3170
01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:11.600
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3171
01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:14.210
<v Speaker 5>And they're going to run out of bugs and I'm one of the.</v>

3172
01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:16.520
<v Speaker 5>I'm one of the first time they've stepped out to be like,</v>

3173
01:26:16.521 --> 01:26:17.354
<v Speaker 5>all right,</v>

3174
01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.193
<v Speaker 5>there's this dude,</v>

3175
01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:18.891
<v Speaker 5>he's Chinese.</v>

3176
01:26:18.891 --> 01:26:19.611
<v Speaker 5>He's into hip hop.</v>

3177
01:26:19.611 --> 01:26:20.750
<v Speaker 5>He lives in downtown New York.</v>

3178
01:26:20.751 --> 01:26:21.770
<v Speaker 5>He used to sell drugs.</v>

3179
01:26:21.771 --> 01:26:23.210
<v Speaker 5>He now has a restaurant.</v>

3180
01:26:23.230 --> 01:26:27.170
<v Speaker 5>I think I was the only working chef that was a ted fellow.</v>

3181
01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:27.940
<v Speaker 5>So I,</v>

3182
01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:30.140
<v Speaker 5>I was one of their choices that was really out there,</v>

3183
01:26:30.141 --> 01:26:31.160
<v Speaker 5>but it just didn't work out,</v>

3184
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:34.310
<v Speaker 5>but it didn't work out because you're not willing to be a fucking slave and</v>

3185
01:26:34.311 --> 01:26:36.770
<v Speaker 5>sleep in a hotel room with a stranger for a week.</v>

3186
01:26:36.771 --> 01:26:37.160
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3187
01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:37.993
<v Speaker 5>that's insane.</v>

3188
01:26:38.330 --> 01:26:39.650
<v Speaker 5>I rehearsed for two days.</v>

3189
01:26:39.651 --> 01:26:40.540
<v Speaker 5>I fucking did the PTO.</v>

3190
01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:42.260
<v Speaker 5>I did everything I'm supposed to do and then I was like,</v>

3191
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:44.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to just piece out for like a half day.</v>

3192
01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:44.650
<v Speaker 5>And they bugged.</v>

3193
01:26:44.650 --> 01:26:45.261
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3194
01:26:45.261 --> 01:26:46.094
<v Speaker 5>You know you,</v>

3195
01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:46.730
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

3196
01:26:46.730 --> 01:26:47.563
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>

3197
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:48.770
<v Speaker 5>And it's the fact that they don't pay you.</v>

3198
01:26:48.771 --> 01:26:49.520
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

3199
01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:53.290
<v Speaker 5>You guys need to do a vice show exposing Ted tabs.</v>

3200
01:26:53.390 --> 01:26:54.570
<v Speaker 5>I told vice that I,</v>

3201
01:26:54.580 --> 01:26:56.540
<v Speaker 5>I told him that before I got booted.</v>

3202
01:26:56.541 --> 01:26:57.440
<v Speaker 5>I sent them an email like,</v>

3203
01:26:57.441 --> 01:26:57.621
<v Speaker 5>Yo,</v>

3204
01:26:57.621 --> 01:26:58.520
<v Speaker 5>you got to see this shit.</v>

3205
01:26:58.521 --> 01:27:00.560
<v Speaker 5>It's like the beginnings of scientology.</v>

3206
01:27:00.950 --> 01:27:02.480
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3207
01:27:02.630 --> 01:27:07.550
<v Speaker 5>It is so true that once people have a position of power and influence and people</v>

3208
01:27:07.551 --> 01:27:08.780
<v Speaker 5>want to be a part of them,</v>

3209
01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:10.370
<v Speaker 5>people go corrupt.</v>

3210
01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:11.433
<v Speaker 5>Yup.</v>

3211
01:27:12.460 --> 01:27:15.680
<v Speaker 5>What is the threshold at which something becomes a religion?</v>

3212
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:16.550
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3213
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:17.600
<v Speaker 5>it's kind of insane.</v>

3214
01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:19.880
<v Speaker 5>It's so easy to start a cult today.</v>

3215
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:22.580
<v Speaker 5>There's so many people looking to jump on board,</v>

3216
01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:23.180
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3217
01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:26.600
<v Speaker 5>all the people that would have 100 years ago become Catholics now.</v>

3218
01:27:26.601 --> 01:27:26.900
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>

3219
01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:27.733
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3220
01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.720
<v Speaker 5>Pope just won't stop fucking kids.</v>

3221
01:27:29.721 --> 01:27:30.680
<v Speaker 5>I can't do this.</v>

3222
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:32.240
<v Speaker 5>I needed a new cult.</v>

3223
01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:34.250
<v Speaker 5>I don't know why people still believe in these.</v>

3224
01:27:34.251 --> 01:27:36.200
<v Speaker 5>Really like you look at what these people are doing,</v>

3225
01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:37.220
<v Speaker 5>like what these.</v>

3226
01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:39.890
<v Speaker 5>What's happening in the Catholic church is insane.</v>

3227
01:27:39.891 --> 01:27:43.460
<v Speaker 5>Fucking popes resigning because the first time it's gotten so hot that the</v>

3228
01:27:43.461 --> 01:27:43.911
<v Speaker 5>pope's like,</v>

3229
01:27:43.911 --> 01:27:44.744
<v Speaker 5>I'm Outta here.</v>

3230
01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.790
<v Speaker 5>He's asked for immunity from the Catholic,</v>

3231
01:27:46.791 --> 01:27:48.650
<v Speaker 5>from the Italian government,</v>

3232
01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:52.940
<v Speaker 5>from prosecution because he's responsible for shielding pedophiles.</v>

3233
01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:54.110
<v Speaker 5>He personally,</v>

3234
01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:55.520
<v Speaker 5>and a lot of people don't know this,</v>

3235
01:27:55.610 --> 01:28:00.610
<v Speaker 5>the pope personally responsible for taking pedophiles and shifting them away to</v>

3236
01:28:01.161 --> 01:28:02.810
<v Speaker 5>another place where they molested more kids.</v>

3237
01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:03.910
<v Speaker 5>And what would you expect?</v>

3238
01:28:03.911 --> 01:28:04.400
<v Speaker 5>You don't.</v>

3239
01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.110
<v Speaker 5>These people aren't allowed to have sex.</v>

3240
01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:07.910
<v Speaker 5>It's natural to want to have sex.</v>

3241
01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:10.220
<v Speaker 5>It's natural to want to go to La and do podcasts.</v>

3242
01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:10.460
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3243
01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:13.820
<v Speaker 5>as soon as you cannot come to Ted and have sex without condoms,</v>

3244
01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:14.181
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like,</v>

3245
01:28:14.181 --> 01:28:14.700
<v Speaker 5>fuck that.</v>

3246
01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:14.850
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>

3247
01:28:14.850 --> 01:28:17.750
<v Speaker 5>you imagine no unprotected sex.</v>

3248
01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:18.770
<v Speaker 5>There's no raw dogging.</v>

3249
01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:19.880
<v Speaker 5>Attend illegal.</v>

3250
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:21.710
<v Speaker 5>No Ass fucking while you're here.</v>

3251
01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:22.573
<v Speaker 5>Oh Man.</v>

3252
01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:23.810
<v Speaker 5>You're a ted fellow.</v>

3253
01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:24.693
<v Speaker 5>There would be a mutiny.</v>

3254
01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:26.370
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if they would have like you,</v>

3255
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:29.930
<v Speaker 5>you could slowly start imposing behavior standards.</v>

3256
01:28:29.931 --> 01:28:30.190
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3257
01:28:30.190 --> 01:28:30.861
<v Speaker 5>on fellows,</v>

3258
01:28:30.861 --> 01:28:31.011
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3259
01:28:31.011 --> 01:28:32.770
<v Speaker 5>if you want to call it like a ted fellow or,</v>

3260
01:28:32.771 --> 01:28:34.820
<v Speaker 5>or whatever new organization you want to start.</v>

3261
01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:35.481
<v Speaker 5>They do shit.</v>

3262
01:28:35.481 --> 01:28:36.590
<v Speaker 5>Like you should have a standing.</v>

3263
01:28:36.591 --> 01:28:38.680
<v Speaker 5>You should give a standing ovation when this person calls me,</v>

3264
01:28:38.690 --> 01:28:39.580
<v Speaker 5>you should do this and that.</v>

3265
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:40.310
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>

3266
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:41.143
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3267
01:28:41.610 --> 01:28:42.081
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute,</v>

3268
01:28:42.081 --> 01:28:42.590
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute.</v>

3269
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:44.090
<v Speaker 5>Fake standing ovations.</v>

3270
01:28:44.091 --> 01:28:44.301
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3271
01:28:44.301 --> 01:28:45.440
<v Speaker 5>And they were also saying like,</v>

3272
01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:45.771
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3273
01:28:45.771 --> 01:28:46.581
<v Speaker 5>when the founder comes,</v>

3274
01:28:46.581 --> 01:28:47.590
<v Speaker 5>Chris Anderson comes like,</v>

3275
01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:49.520
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to give him a standing ovation.</v>

3276
01:28:49.521 --> 01:28:49.910
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

3277
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:50.331
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3278
01:28:50.331 --> 01:28:51.240
<v Speaker 5>it's nice if you want to,</v>

3279
01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:53.120
<v Speaker 5>but he doesn't actually need you to do it.</v>

3280
01:28:53.121 --> 01:28:56.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm like the fact that you needed to give me this fake halfway disclaimers.</v>

3281
01:28:56.830 --> 01:28:58.100
<v Speaker 5>So fucking strange.</v>

3282
01:28:58.160 --> 01:28:58.611
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3283
01:28:58.611 --> 01:28:59.890
<v Speaker 5>That's so strange.</v>

3284
01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:04.980
<v Speaker 5>Are they tell you who to and not to give standing ovations to who's allowed to</v>

3285
01:29:05.101 --> 01:29:05.551
<v Speaker 5>apply.</v>

3286
01:29:05.551 --> 01:29:09.540
<v Speaker 5>You have to apply to go to Ted to attend and then once you're accepted you pay</v>

3287
01:29:09.541 --> 01:29:10.650
<v Speaker 5>$8,000.</v>

3288
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.871
<v Speaker 5>That's a mind.</v>

3289
01:29:12.871 --> 01:29:13.440
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

3290
01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.310
<v Speaker 5>Wait a minute.</v>

3291
01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:15.493
<v Speaker 5>You had to pay.</v>

3292
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.781
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3293
