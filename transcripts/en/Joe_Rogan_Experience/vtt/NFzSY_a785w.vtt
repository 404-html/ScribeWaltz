<v Speaker 1>a decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe two decades.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm old.</v>

17
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted to be able to create </v>

18
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.261
<v Speaker 1>my own website,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't have the patience and wait </v>

19
00:00:58.261 --> 00:00:58.570
<v Speaker 1>to add to like sit down and learn how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>code.</v>

20
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>But you could do something on </v>

<v Speaker 1>simple and easy and have it be a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice website.</v>

22
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.910

<v Speaker 1>we're going to put on a contest.</v>

23
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.910
<v Speaker 1>We're working out the details right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24

<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

26
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.100
<v Speaker 1>We're going to set up some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>contest where the person who has the </v>

<v Speaker 1>neuroplasticity and that's what square,</v>

71
00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>options like memory and then when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to memory,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like recalling the location of objects </v>

00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:01.780
<v Speaker 1>or learning new subjects quickly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurately.</v>

78
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Then go to attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a bunch of different things that </v>

79
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.351

<v Speaker 1>natural ability to adapt to new </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

<v Speaker 2>brain.</v>

149
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.870
<v Speaker 2>That's what a short documentary about </v>
<v Speaker 2>lynch often mitch hedberg and one of the</v>

150
00:07:29.841 --> 00:07:33.830
<v Speaker 2>things that he says in this old </v>
<v Speaker 2>interview is like he got people them for</v>

151
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.660
<v Speaker 2>advice all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young comedians,</v>

152
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.200
<v Speaker 2>and he just says like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>write down what's funny.</v>

153
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Don't be lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't be lazy.</v>

154
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.780
<v Speaker 2>piece of advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

155
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.820
<v Speaker 2>Especially from a heroin addict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare that you get like non </v>

156
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 2>lazy heroin addicts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

157
00:07:49.911 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't make me laugh at that.</v>

158
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is true and I think it's </v>

159
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 2>important to talk about because it's why</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not with us anymore.</v>

160
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.430
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the greats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is,</v>

161
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.480
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is one of the most incredibly rich </v>

162
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.210
<v Speaker 2>guys of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was so good and so clean.</v>

163
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Super clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

164
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.900
<v Speaker 2>Which like for no reason it was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>inventive.</v>

165
00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Mind was so inventive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

166
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.480
<v Speaker 2>He was a really unique comic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he also had a problem with heroin.</v>

167
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 2>He had some drug issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seemed.</v>

168
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.740
<v Speaker 2>I'd say that never your office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who am I to say?</v>

169
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:23.540

<v Speaker 2>I was friends with mitch,</v>

170
00:08:23.541 --> 00:08:25.850
<v Speaker 2>I never saw him use drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

171
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was friends with mitch and I never saw</v>

172
00:08:28.211 --> 00:08:29.300
<v Speaker 2>him use drugs either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

173
00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

174
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.270
<v Speaker 2>I saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

176
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.580

<v Speaker 2>and it's just,</v>

177
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.890
<v Speaker 2>it's very sad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

178
00:08:36.891 --> 00:08:37.160
<v Speaker 2>when</v>

179
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.500
<v Speaker 1>stan hope and I were working together on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man show,</v>

180
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.900
<v Speaker 1>the bastardized second version of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>man show,</v>

181
00:08:42.901 --> 00:08:47.901
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember was when he got gangrene and </v>

182
00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I remember that in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

183
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He almost lost his leg and uh,</v>

184
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came back from that and everybody </v>

185
00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:56.670
<v Speaker 1>was hoping that he was of clean up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>get his shit together,</v>

186
00:08:56.671 --> 00:08:59.700
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

187
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

188
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 1>he burned brightly and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's gone.</v>

189
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

190
00:09:04.751 --> 00:09:08.520
<v Speaker 1>what was important though about his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his artwork?</v>

191
00:09:08.521 --> 00:09:10.940
<v Speaker 1>What he did was he was so prolific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.440
<v Speaker 1>and constantly and it is super </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplined,</v>

193
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.800
<v Speaker 1>very disciplined in his style is like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really difficult style to be realistic </v>

194
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:18.800
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

195
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Because it's not like weird observations</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are non sequiturs one nonsequitor </v>

196
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:23.900
<v Speaker 1>after another.</v>

197
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

198
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:29.120
<v Speaker 2>I have this memory when it always feels </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a blur,</v>

199
00:09:29.121 --> 00:09:34.121
<v Speaker 2>but I remember when he passed away and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a memorial service like at </v>

200
00:09:34.121 --> 00:09:37.541
<v Speaker 2>carolines in New York and I was with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>standing on the street with dave attell </v>

201
00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:40.160
<v Speaker 2>and my wife and mitchell's mother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mary,</v>

202
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.840
<v Speaker 2>and she's passed away now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

203
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.220
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

204
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dave and mary were smoking cigarettes </v>

205
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.370
<v Speaker 2>and then dave goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

206
00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:51.980
<v Speaker 2>and it was going to sound trite way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm repeating it,</v>

207
00:09:51.981 --> 00:09:55.580
<v Speaker 2>but dave has a profound nest to him that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it kind of gets away with this.</v>

208
00:09:55.581 --> 00:09:58.600
<v Speaker 2>He was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll always have the albums,</v>

209
00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.220
<v Speaker 2>like we'll always have the albums.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's true.</v>

210
00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.220
<v Speaker 2>There is something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's like we lose a lot of people,</v>

211
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.350
<v Speaker 2>but with mitch will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have this really special thing.</v>

212
00:10:06.351 --> 00:10:11.351
<v Speaker 2>Like we have these beautiful comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>albums which are like a moment in time </v>

213
00:10:11.351 --> 00:10:13.400
<v Speaker 2>that are perfect jokes and like perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>wisdom.</v>

214
00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:18.480
<v Speaker 2>The wisdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's wisdom in matches comedy as far </v>

215
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:18.480
<v Speaker 2>as I'm.</v>

216
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

217
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:23.170
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're one of those things where he </v>

218
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:23.170
<v Speaker 1>know some of his jokes are just so </v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterous,</v>

219
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.310
<v Speaker 1>but other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

220
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll just,</v>

221
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.010
<v Speaker 1>you'll just listen to it and you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

222
00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck,</v>

223
00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:33.040
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my favorite is somebody asked me if</v>

224
00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:35.290
<v Speaker 1>I wanted a frozen banana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said no,</v>

225
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.170
<v Speaker 1>but I want a regular banana later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

226
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.800
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just so.</v>

227
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.750
<v Speaker 1>There's so uniquely him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

228
00:10:44.751 --> 00:10:45.700
<v Speaker 1>and almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

229
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.930
<v Speaker 1>there's like a vein of that comedy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes from I guess like Steven Wright </v>

230
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.620
<v Speaker 1>know who's got that sort of absurdist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird way of looking at things.</v>

231
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.110
<v Speaker 1>But then mitch would take it to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally new place.</v>

232
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.330

<v Speaker 2>and then someone didn't hear me that </v>

238
00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.330
<v Speaker 2>well and they asked me to repeat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's all,</v>

243
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.380

<v Speaker 2>I feel bad.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he minds from material in a way,</v>

276

<v Speaker 2>like another good example that is patent</v>
<v Speaker 2>patent oswald get to like,</v>

277
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.690
<v Speaker 2>I look at it like I've listened to some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his cds and I go,</v>

278
00:12:46.691 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 2>that's a bit that I probably would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>abandoned.</v>

279
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.820
<v Speaker 2>I would have started maybe working on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried it on stage a few times and just </v>

280
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.580
<v Speaker 2>moved on to something with more meat to </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

281
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:59.820
<v Speaker 2>But he'll take an idea that's like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>odd idea that maybe I would have </v>

282
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.380
<v Speaker 2>abandoned and turn it into an amazing 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>minute Chunk,</v>

283
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.300
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

284
00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:06.280

<v Speaker 2>It'll also,</v>

285
00:13:06.281 --> 00:13:11.281
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I love about patents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just genuinely passionate about </v>

286
00:13:11.281 --> 00:13:11.640
<v Speaker 2>what he's talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it is a,</v>

287
00:13:11.641 --> 00:13:13.250
<v Speaker 2>I wrote a letter to my dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote,</v>

288
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:18.530
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoy being here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I accidentally wrote rarely instead </v>

289
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:19.750
<v Speaker 2>of really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still wanted to use it,</v>

290
00:13:19.751 --> 00:13:23.720
<v Speaker 2>so I crossed it out and wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rarely drive steam boats dead.</v>

291
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:29.710
<v Speaker 2>You don't know about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of act like I'm a steam boat </v>

292
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:30.010
<v Speaker 2>operator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Took a harsh turn right away,</v>

293
00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.580
<v Speaker 2>like one of my favorite jokes of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

294
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.820
<v Speaker 2>It's a perfect joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a great impression.</v>

295
00:13:36.821 --> 00:13:41.821
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this not exactly like that's like a </v>

296
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:41.821
<v Speaker 2>piece of philosophy I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

297
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:43.570
<v Speaker 2>just a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do think that.</v>

298
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Well it's a piece of mitch didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

299
00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.260
<v Speaker 2>that in and tells a way of saying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

330
00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.480
<v Speaker 2>you're just supposed to see the final </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes onstage.</v>

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 2>That's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that true?</v>

332
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.820
<v Speaker 2>When you date girls and they see your </v>
<v Speaker 2>act over and over and over again and </v>

333
00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:13.410
<v Speaker 2>they lose all the magic you have to meet</v>
<v Speaker 2>and marry them or break up with it.</v>

334
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:18.590
<v Speaker 2>You got to do one or the other because </v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise they're going to tell their </v>

335
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.590
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>

337
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not that big a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can do it.</v>

338
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.280
<v Speaker 2>The mystique goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The mystique,</v>

339
00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.950
<v Speaker 2>that mystique of writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was a.</v>

340
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:33.440
<v Speaker 2>He was such a unique guy in that he did </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously have issues with drugs,</v>

341
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:38.770
<v Speaker 2>but he also obviously it was really </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking prolific and really wrote a lot </v>

342
00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:39.830
<v Speaker 2>and was really disciplined.</v>

343
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.920

344
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:44.920
<v Speaker 2>combination of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

349
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.650

<v Speaker 2>I feel like I should almost plug this.</v>

350
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:55.970
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to mitch altogether.</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called my girlfriend's boyfriend.</v>

359
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.580
<v Speaker 2>It's about a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about a lot of like heartbreak and </v>

360
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.400
<v Speaker 2>love and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how I decided to get married despite</v>

361
00:16:22.401 --> 00:16:24.800
<v Speaker 2>the fact that I don't reallY believe in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of marriage.</v>

362
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a stupid idea,</v>

363
00:16:26.391 --> 00:16:28.400
<v Speaker 2>but it works for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works for women.</v>

364
00:16:28.401 --> 00:16:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Women love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love it.</v>

365
00:16:29.781 --> 00:16:31.910
<v Speaker 2>They love being able to tell their </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends are married getting.</v>

366
00:16:31.911 --> 00:16:33.140
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

367
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.670
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like winning.</v>

368
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:39.850
<v Speaker 2>They win and then you might get married </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they enjoyed that.</v>

369
00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My wife,</v>

370
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:45.020
<v Speaker 2>totally one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an interesting perspective.</v>

371
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:48.200
<v Speaker 2>I've never thought about it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

372
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happier though.</v>

373
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:51.950
<v Speaker 2>Are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you happy?</v>

374
00:16:51.951 --> 00:16:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

375
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.770
<v Speaker 2>But it's just because I'm in a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship.</v>

376
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:59.980
<v Speaker 2>I would have been just as happy if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have some shit written down on </v>

377
00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.280
<v Speaker 2>paper or wearing a little monkey ring.</v>

378
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.370
<v Speaker 2>It's all that stuff is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems secondary,</v>

379
00:17:04.371 --> 00:17:08.540
<v Speaker 2>but for women it means a lot that you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>through that nonsense.</v>

380
00:17:08.541 --> 00:17:11.060
<v Speaker 2>Or for some women I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't never generalize like that.</v>

381
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Some of them they want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want that nonsense.</v>

382
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:19.300
<v Speaker 2>They want that cultural nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to be able to tell their </v>

383
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:19.300
<v Speaker 2>friends are married.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

384
00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:23.321
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I think part of it's the family </v>

385
00:17:23.321 --> 00:17:23.321
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

386
00:17:23.321 --> 00:17:23.321
<v Speaker 2>The families are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

387
00:17:23.321 --> 00:17:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real people start to go.</v>

388
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

389
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:32.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certain things that people just </v>

390
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.211
<v Speaker 2>don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't believe unless it has a </v>

391
00:17:34.211 --> 00:17:38.111
<v Speaker 2>formal cultural understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>LIke this is maybe a tangential example,</v>

392
00:17:38.631 --> 00:17:43.190
<v Speaker 2>but like my cat passed away this summer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and for your cap,</v>

393
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:45.080
<v Speaker 2>trying to figure out how you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come back.</v>

394
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.280
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

395
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't know either yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

396
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.460
<v Speaker 2>my cat I haven't passed away.</v>

397
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.750
<v Speaker 2>My wife and I were so upset like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like it,</v>

398
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:55.950
<v Speaker 2>like the whole summer was like our cat </v>
<v Speaker 2>passed away.</v>

399
00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:57.210
<v Speaker 2>That's people will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's up?</v>

400
00:17:57.211 --> 00:17:58.050
<v Speaker 2>We'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our cap.</v>

401
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.360
<v Speaker 2>I haven't passed away the whole summer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

402
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.510
<v Speaker 2>we were really upset by it.</v>

403
00:18:03.511 --> 00:18:05.060
<v Speaker 2>I have a 17 year old category now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

404
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:10.070
<v Speaker 2>So like we were so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so close to ivan and explaining that </v>

405
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:15.051
<v Speaker 2>your cat died is a little bit like </v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining that your imaginary friend </v>

406

<v Speaker 2>died where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he ivan's dead and they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like that too.</v>

411
00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:27.870
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not married you can be like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>loves me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

415

419
00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:47.570
<v Speaker 1>look at that as like there's like goals </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they have to achieve,</v>

420
00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.400
<v Speaker 1>get in a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

422
00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:54.650
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hate that.</v>

423
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the part of it.</v>

424
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who went through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking absolutely brutal divorce.</v>

425
00:18:59.031 --> 00:19:00.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad one.</v>

426
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.810
<v Speaker 1>And then his new wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

427
00:19:02.811 --> 00:19:05.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he started dating this woman immediately</v>

428
00:19:05.541 --> 00:19:08.090
<v Speaker 1>afterwards of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she didn't want to sign a prenup.</v>

429
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he lost everything and you know,</v>

430
00:19:11.391 --> 00:19:13.400
<v Speaker 1>and it's like I don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't know what to do.</v>

431
00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:14.570
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

432
00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.040
<v Speaker 1>do you hate yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

433
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.040
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like match doesn't always work out,</v>

434
00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:21.410
<v Speaker 1>buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't always work out the prenup on</v>

435
00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:22.290
<v Speaker 1>the second marriage.</v>

436
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

437
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:25.380
<v Speaker 1>When he lost everything on the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

438
00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lost everything on the first marriage</v>

439
00:19:27.531 --> 00:19:31.480
<v Speaker 1>and I'm pretty sure they overlapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like his first marriage was fine.</v>

440
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.940
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to ask him about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His first marriage was falling apart and</v>

441
00:19:34.941 --> 00:19:37.550
<v Speaker 1>then he met her and there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

442
00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:42.551
<v Speaker 1>he knew her while he was still with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife and then he got divorced like he </v>

443
00:19:42.551 --> 00:19:42.551
<v Speaker 1>had like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

444
00:19:42.551 --> 00:19:46.220
<v Speaker 1>the old expression about like swinging </v>
<v Speaker 1>from branch to branch that uh,</v>

445
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most women especially,</v>

446
00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:53.410
<v Speaker 1>they don't like to let go of a branch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They like to swing and then know that </v>

447
00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:55.280
<v Speaker 1>there's another branch there when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>let go theIr first branch.</v>

448
00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.510
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to say women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just said people.</v>

449
00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:58.650
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humans.</v>

450
00:19:58.651 --> 00:19:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

451
00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:00.240
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

452
00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:02.160

454
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:08.930
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the marriage thing is weird now </v>

455
00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.121
<v Speaker 2>particularly to be in light of all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these supplements and things that you </v>

456
00:20:11.121 --> 00:20:13.020
<v Speaker 2>talk about because people are just going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to live longer.</v>

457
00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not with this stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're lucky you get another </v>

459
00:20:19.371 --> 00:20:20.190
<v Speaker 2>five years or 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alpha and proteIn vitamins.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like hip replacements and heart </v>

464
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:33.981
<v Speaker 2>transplants and all is well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much futuristic stuff right </v>

465
00:20:33.981 --> 00:20:34.840
<v Speaker 2>now that's gonna make people live longer</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's going to be like,</v>

466
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:40.220
<v Speaker 2>it already was weird that we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>married 30 years and what if I were </v>

467
00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:41.040
<v Speaker 2>married 70 years?</v>

468
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that sense,</v>

469
00:20:42.031 --> 00:20:47.031
<v Speaker 2>I think that if it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works and if you're married for 30 </v>

470
00:20:47.031 --> 00:20:49.390
<v Speaker 2>years and you really happy and then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to live for another hundred,</v>

471
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:54.450
<v Speaker 2>would you want to break up and start </v>
<v Speaker 2>fresh with a new person and try to put </v>

472
00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.811
<v Speaker 2>it together?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like part of what makes a marriage work </v>

473
00:20:57.811 --> 00:20:59.530
<v Speaker 2>or friendship work or anything is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of understand how each other works.</v>

474
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.260
<v Speaker 2>Kind of understand what the ins and the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

475
00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That when that happens so much </v>

476
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.580
<v Speaker 2>theoretically in practice when it's done</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly,</v>

477
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.100
<v Speaker 2>which it never is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it is done perfectly,</v>

478
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.950
<v Speaker 2>that's what makes it so cool is that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know each other,</v>

479
00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you'd go to the store and like,</v>

480
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.220
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know she loves this kind of shit.</v>

481
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.530
<v Speaker 2>I'll go to go get her this or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to go on a vacation.</v>

482
00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.160
<v Speaker 2>She's never going to want to do this or </v>
<v Speaker 2>she loves doing this.</v>

483
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know each other.</v>

484
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.910
<v Speaker 2>So in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would it really matter if you live to be</v>

485
00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:30.790
<v Speaker 2>an extra hundred years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not,</v>

486
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.280
<v Speaker 2>except you'd start thinking about all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that extra pussy.</v>

487
00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That age 100 pussies crazy I've heard.</v>

488
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.880
<v Speaker 2>Just gets different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just different.</v>

489
00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:42.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like wine in a barrel or old </v>
<v Speaker 2>scotch.</v>

490
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to just read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to take that back from the </v>

491
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:47.880
<v Speaker 2>record.</v>

492
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.430

<v Speaker 2>100 line.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

00:23:18.811 --> 00:23:20.070
<v Speaker 2>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever get that feeling?</v>

541
00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.270
<v Speaker 2>camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was good looking and,</v>

542
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.240
<v Speaker 2>and before that you didn't have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>good looking as a president.</v>

543
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.840
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was like a big shift in culture and</v>

544
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.860
<v Speaker 2>they say that barack obama is the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>president at where it's like,</v>

545
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.980
<v Speaker 2>he's like a rockstar precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people are like,</v>

546
00:23:57.981 --> 00:24:00.130
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've,</v>

547
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of people say like,</v>

548
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:03.860
<v Speaker 2>people voted for him because they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just excited.</v>

549
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:07.460
<v Speaker 2>It's so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take it a step further,</v>

550
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.280
<v Speaker 2>like 20 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president.</v>

551
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:11.180
<v Speaker 2>And it's hilarious.</v>

552
00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.460
<v Speaker 2>Hilarious about wanting the military </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrial complex.</v>

553
00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:22.140
<v Speaker 2>Unless some massive paradigm shift takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>place where we no longer have wore a.</v>

554
00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't see anybody running any country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being hilarious.</v>

555
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.040
<v Speaker 2>President is hilarious and he's in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great shape.</v>

556
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.430
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

557
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:35.470
<v Speaker 2>that's all I got.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I think you could be a </v>

558
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:35.470
<v Speaker 2>politician in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

559
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.740
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the time has come because I feel </v>

560
00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.161
<v Speaker 2>like if you were in charge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would vote for you because I would </v>

561
00:24:42.161 --> 00:24:42.161
<v Speaker 2>feel confident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

562
00:24:42.161 --> 00:24:43.520
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

563
00:24:43.521 --> 00:24:47.880
<v Speaker 2>He smoked some pot jury posts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most smoked some pot on that.</v>

564
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:51.890
<v Speaker 2>But he's really strong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physically strong,</v>

565
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:53.630
<v Speaker 2>smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>funny.</v>

566
00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's enough for me.</v>

567
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.540
<v Speaker 2>Reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasonable,</v>

568
00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:58.520
<v Speaker 2>reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is I probably the most important thing.</v>

569
00:24:58.521 --> 00:25:03.521
<v Speaker 2>Anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think the most important </v>

570
00:25:03.521 --> 00:25:05.381
<v Speaker 2>quality you need to govern?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's probably not wanting to </v>

571
00:25:05.381 --> 00:25:09.191
<v Speaker 2>govern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not wanting to be the guy that's in </v>

572
00:25:09.191 --> 00:25:09.191
<v Speaker 2>charge.</v>

573
00:25:09.191 --> 00:25:10.160
<v Speaker 2>I think that might be one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>qualities than anybody could ever have.</v>

574
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:15.220
<v Speaker 2>if you want to run things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he should not want to be the guy who </v>

575
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:15.220
<v Speaker 2>runs things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

576
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:20.080
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think low level headed I think is a </v>

577
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.260
<v Speaker 2>huge quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I feel like the reason I voted </v>

578
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:23.870
<v Speaker 2>for barack obama is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just felt like,</v>

579
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.210
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he seems smart,</v>

580
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:28.700

<v Speaker 2>It seems levelheaded,</v>

581
00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:32.300
<v Speaker 2>dead man in a dump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the alternative.</v>

582
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.930
<v Speaker 2>And so what was the alternative?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next.</v>

583
00:25:35.931 --> 00:25:40.010
<v Speaker 2>It was a fucking mormon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A guy who's literally believes in one of</v>

584
00:25:40.011 --> 00:25:43.700
<v Speaker 2>the most preposterous religious stories </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the history of humanity.</v>

585
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:49.120
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his family was a part of a cult that </v>

586
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.540
<v Speaker 2>moved to Mexico so they can have more </v>

<v Speaker 2>his dad was born in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>his dad wasn't an american citizen that </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

597
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.770
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't born with a natural born </v>
<v Speaker 2>citizen where,</v>

599
00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:19.150
<v Speaker 2>He was born in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his family comes from this sect of </v>

600
00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:23.111
<v Speaker 2>mormonism that broke off from the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States back in the 18 hundreds when it </v>

601
00:26:23.111 --> 00:26:24.710
<v Speaker 2>really didn't matter if he lived in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can live in Mexico.</v>

602
00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.420
<v Speaker 2>you live in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

603
00:26:26.421 --> 00:26:28.190
<v Speaker 2>There's no cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what they did.</v>

604
00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:33.220
<v Speaker 2>They moved to Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit didn't turn out so good for that </v>

<v Speaker 2>He was speeding around a blind corner.</v>

792
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:41.560
<v Speaker 2>He technically had the right away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then by the time he got to the </v>

<v Speaker 2>hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he blew under the legal limit once in a </v>

<v Speaker 2>bruce at the end of his career when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would go on with legal document.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I project the extra part in the show.</v>

816
00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:43.200
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so the guy was drunk.</v>

817
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:44.890
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he technically had the right away.</v>

818
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to figure it out in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were going around a blind corner and</v>

819
00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.910
<v Speaker 2>coming around blind corners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was coming around,</v>

820
00:35:49.911 --> 00:35:53.130
<v Speaker 2>we're speeding around a blind corner on </v>
<v Speaker 2>venice beach.</v>

821
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:58.640
<v Speaker 2>And you pulled into the trap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pulled into a,</v>

822
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:03.060
<v Speaker 2>into a road and then he t boned me </v>
<v Speaker 2>driver's side.</v>

823
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:04.770
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then.</v>

824
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:08.130
<v Speaker 2>And then I spun around and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

825
00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:12.590
<v Speaker 2>drove away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took a right turn at the intersection,</v>

826
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:17.750
<v Speaker 2>tried to speed away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was so drunk he drove into a </v>

827
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.971
<v Speaker 2>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like a hit and run and hit and</v>

828
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.040
<v Speaker 2>still didn't get in trouble for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

829
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.470
<v Speaker 2>That's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talked to lawyers,</v>

830
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.870
<v Speaker 2>I talked to private investigators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were just like,</v>

831
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:33.200
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to cost you more in legal </v>

832
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:33.200
<v Speaker 2>fees to fight this.</v>

833
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:33.200
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

834
00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:37.461
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to sue this guy and I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to sue the los angeles police </v>

835
00:36:37.461 --> 00:36:37.461
<v Speaker 2>department.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like,</v>

836
00:36:37.461 --> 00:36:38.270
<v Speaker 2>chinatown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chinatown.</v>

837
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.670
<v Speaker 2>It was maddening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

838
00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.290
<v Speaker 2>in the effort to protect people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>

839
00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.880
<v Speaker 2>things get kind of squirrely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

840
00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:51.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for protecting people's rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that once you start driving </v>

841
00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:56.061
<v Speaker 2>intoxicated and slamming into people </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they need to figure out who's drunk</v>

842
00:36:56.191 --> 00:37:01.191
<v Speaker 2>right away after an accident,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't let people go all the way to </v>

843
00:37:01.191 --> 00:37:01.191
<v Speaker 2>the hospital again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>

844
00:37:01.191 --> 00:37:05.691
<v Speaker 2>You need that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's something that needs to be dealt </v>

845
00:37:05.691 --> 00:37:05.691
<v Speaker 2>with on the spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the question is,</v>

846
00:37:05.691 --> 00:37:07.140
<v Speaker 2>who's going to be the guy who deals with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

847
00:37:07.141 --> 00:37:12.141
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be some knucklehead police</v>
<v Speaker 2>officer that's we're going to hold you </v>

848
00:37:12.141 --> 00:37:12.141
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tase you,</v>

849
00:37:12.141 --> 00:37:12.690
<v Speaker 2>and then take your blood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

850
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:14.850
<v Speaker 2>how do they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do they get it?</v>

851

<v Speaker 2>They can test your blood alcohol </v>

853
00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:21.870

<v Speaker 2>I was okay.</v>

861
00:37:33.151 --> 00:37:38.151
<v Speaker 2>I went to the emergency room and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw him first because he was a more </v>

862
00:37:38.151 --> 00:37:38.151

00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.360
<v Speaker 2>in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My religion,</v>

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:35.580
<v Speaker 2>that I could never perform comedy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of my life for some strange </v>

<v Speaker 2>He's really.</v>

931
00:40:17.021 --> 00:40:19.600
<v Speaker 2>He's really like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come into his own as an artist,</v>

932
00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:24.900
<v Speaker 2>as a standup comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That special is if there are any </v>

933
00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.550
<v Speaker 2>aspiring comedians listening or </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's got a bunch of great ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got lots of good stuff.</v>

936
00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:36.790
<v Speaker 2>This is the one where he talks about </v>
<v Speaker 2>letting his mother go.</v>

937
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

938
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:40.070
<v Speaker 2>That's an incredible story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

939
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good stuff,</v>

940
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:43.720
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't live in bisbee,</v>

941
00:40:43.721 --> 00:40:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck is thinking.</v>

942
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:51.480
<v Speaker 2>He's just very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to describe what that </v>

943
00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.640
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a great joke about lIving there</v>

944
00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:57.100
<v Speaker 2>too though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of it being an artist community</v>

945
00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:00.350
<v Speaker 2>and the difference between how his art </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are.</v>

946
00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:05.370
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really go together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make turquoise belt buckles and </v>

947
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:06.520
<v Speaker 2>he's making a joke about tsunami </v>
<v Speaker 2>victims,</v>

948
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:11.550
<v Speaker 2>about how the the drowned japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they start to swell and they take on </v>

949
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:15.010
<v Speaker 2>this korean look and I'm really </v>
<v Speaker 2>butchering the pit,</v>

950
00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:18.580
<v Speaker 2>but it's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's comparison between his art,</v>

951
00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:22.680
<v Speaker 2>what he considers art and what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider art artists community.</v>

952
00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:27.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I love about him is </v>

953
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:28.960
<v Speaker 2>hilt keeps twisting the knife and </v>
<v Speaker 2>different directions.</v>

954
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he'll take you one way and you'll </v>

955
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:33.990
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ooh,</v>

956
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:36.661
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I could go there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then he'll take you back farther in the </v>

957
00:41:36.661 --> 00:41:36.980
<v Speaker 2>other direction farther,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

958
00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:41.981
<v Speaker 2>Than you could think you get go and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll pull you farther left than you </v>

959
00:41:41.981 --> 00:41:41.981
<v Speaker 2>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

960
00:41:41.981 --> 00:41:42.830
<v Speaker 2>Like he just always has you on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>toes.</v>

961
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.780
<v Speaker 2>He works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that dude.</v>

962
00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:46.550
<v Speaker 2>You see him sitting there smoking a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarette,</v>

963
00:41:46.551 --> 00:41:48.500
<v Speaker 2>drinking coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>banging away on the keyboard,</v>

964
00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.060
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is a,</v>

965
00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.250
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what you're saying,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

967
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:58.220
<v Speaker 2>That the discipline of creation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>really what it's all about.</v>

968
00:41:58.221 --> 00:42:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Whether you're writing books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're writing jokes,</v>

969
00:42:01.131 --> 00:42:02.650
<v Speaker 2>whether you're creating music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

970
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.870
<v Speaker 2>I admire the discipline involved and </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating things.</v>

982
00:42:32.541 --> 00:42:33.530
<v Speaker 2>bad mother fucker that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>that show such a perfect vehicle to.</v>

988
00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Because by doing little cartoon kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't look anything like reality </v>

989
00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.901
<v Speaker 2>now and then also having them be kids.</v>

990
00:42:56.901 --> 00:42:59.871
<v Speaker 2>ignorance you can get away with a child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of beautiful vehicle for creating </v>

991
00:43:00.741 --> 00:43:05.390
<v Speaker 2>comedy when you write like all this shit</v>

<v Speaker 2>open the sleeping bag.</v>

1047
00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:28.170
<v Speaker 2>The doctor told me the strangest things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that doctor has ever told me.</v>

<v Speaker 2>a doctor.</v>

1051
00:45:36.271 --> 00:45:37.370
<v Speaker 2>So that to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this is after he jumped out the </v>

1053
00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:42.380
<v Speaker 2>window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1059
00:45:46.651 --> 00:45:48.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure what to tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the meantime,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Is the plaque up yet?</v>

1095
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:21.120
<v Speaker 2>It was like six months after I sent it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>

1096
00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:24.450
<v Speaker 2>And so that's on the door.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's on the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People sometimes will go to that </v>

1098
00:47:29.451 --> 00:47:31.311
<v Speaker 2>laquinta inn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll take photos in front of it and </v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1103
00:47:35.651 --> 00:47:38.500

<v Speaker 1>because you're okay now when you,</v>

1104
00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:41.740
<v Speaker 1>when you jumped through the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you jumped out the window,</v>

1105
00:47:41.741 --> 00:47:45.360
<v Speaker 1>the window through the window shattered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1106
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:47.860
<v Speaker 1>jump through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have in the movie,</v>

1107
00:47:47.861 --> 00:47:50.540
<v Speaker 1>in the final credits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's actual photo</v>

1108
00:47:50.570 --> 00:47:52.820
<v Speaker 2>graphs of after I jumped through the </v>
<v Speaker 2>window,</v>

1109
00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:58.120
<v Speaker 2>I photographed it like it was a crime </v>
<v Speaker 2>scene because I was alone in walla </v>

1110
00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:58.120
<v Speaker 2>walla,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>

1111
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:00.200
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's going to believe me.</v>

1112
00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:00.830
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1113
00:48:00.831 --> 00:48:02.330
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did the hospital all this stuff.</v>

1114
00:48:02.331 --> 00:48:04.550
<v Speaker 2>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is too crazy of a story.</v>

1115
00:48:04.551 --> 00:48:07.250
<v Speaker 2>I need to photograph everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's all in the credits.</v>

1116
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:10.010
<v Speaker 2>How did you get through that without </v>
<v Speaker 2>even getting really badly hurt?</v>

1117
00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:14.660
<v Speaker 2>Be the same reason that a lot times of </v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk drivers aren't hurt.</v>

1118
00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:17.240
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones not injured.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1119
00:48:17.241 --> 00:48:19.490
<v Speaker 2>When they get in car accidents because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're so relaxed,</v>

1120
00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.950
<v Speaker 2>so relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

1121
00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.730
<v Speaker 2>The idea that tension is what hurts you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dreamt.</v>

1122
00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:29.740
<v Speaker 2>I dreamt that I was being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there was a guided missile headed </v>

1123
00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:33.311
<v Speaker 2>towards my hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all this military personnel in </v>

1124
00:48:33.311 --> 00:48:33.320
<v Speaker 2>the room with me and the missile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could they,</v>

1125
00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:38.370
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they told me that missile coordinates </v>

1126
00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:40.001
<v Speaker 2>are set specifically on me and so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought the only thing I could do is </v>

1127
00:48:40.001 --> 00:48:43.571
<v Speaker 2>jump out the window so as to detonate </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside the window for the sake of my </v>

1128
00:48:43.571 --> 00:48:43.571
<v Speaker 2>platoon.</v>

1129
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.000
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you are a hero in your crazy </v>

1130
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:49.000
<v Speaker 1>story?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know head.</v>

1131
00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

1132
00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1133
00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:52.730
<v Speaker 1>what was the extent of your injuries?</v>

1134
00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:58.720
<v Speaker 2>I just had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still have scars on my legs and there </v>

1135
00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.070
<v Speaker 2>was glass in my legs and they took out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the glass and uh,</v>

1136
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:05.390
<v Speaker 2>and my arms were all cut up and I had </v>
<v Speaker 2>about 30 stitches.</v>

1137
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:06.860
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing.</v>

1138
00:49:06.861 --> 00:49:08.330
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing compared to what it could </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been.</v>

1139
00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:13.360
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's wild is I actually jumped </v>

1140
00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.070
<v Speaker 2>through the window and landed and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>got up and kept running.</v>

1141
00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.600
<v Speaker 2>So you were still asleep?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1142
00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.570
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I'm running</v>

1143
00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:25.280
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking around and realizing like,</v>

1144
00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:30.310
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just jumped through a window in walla </v>

<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>

<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>

1147
00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:35.920
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I got to go to the front desk </v>

1148
00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:35.920
<v Speaker 2>and explain what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>

1149
00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:40.790
<v Speaker 2>this is a funny addendum to the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad for my fans.</v>

1150

<v Speaker 2>zillion times.</v>

00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:50.411
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll give you an addendum to the </v>

1153
00:49:50.411 --> 00:49:50.411
<v Speaker 2>story which is new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is.</v>

<v Speaker 2>desk to explain what happened.</v>

1155
00:49:52.821 --> 00:49:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person working at the front desk was</v>

1156
00:49:54.621 --> 00:49:59.621
<v Speaker 2>mildly retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I say fortunately because he's </v>

1157
00:49:59.621 --> 00:49:59.621
<v Speaker 2>completely unfazed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what just happened?</v>

1158
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:02.150
<v Speaker 2>It's three in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The phones are ringing off the hook from</v>

1159
00:50:02.151 --> 00:50:07.151
<v Speaker 2>people staying at the hotel who just saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy jumped out the window screaming,</v>

1160
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:10.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm bleeding in my underwear and I say </v>
<v Speaker 2>hello,</v>

1161
00:50:10.491 --> 00:50:14.450
<v Speaker 2>because you have to start somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm staying at the hotel.</v>

1162
00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I had an incident where I jumped out my </v>
<v Speaker 2>window.</v>

1163
00:50:16.821 --> 00:50:19.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm bleeding and I need to see a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1164
00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:21.140
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was so relieved because,</v>

1165
00:50:21.141 --> 00:50:24.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy working at the front desk goes,</v>

1166
00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like completely unfazed.</v>

1167
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:29.890
<v Speaker 2>What had just happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I drove myself to the hospital.</v>

1168
00:50:29.891 --> 00:50:34.891
<v Speaker 2>He told me where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The agenda is that guy who worked the </v>

1169
00:50:34.891 --> 00:50:36.560
<v Speaker 2>front desk facebook messaged me and </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1170
00:50:36.561 --> 00:50:41.561
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the guy at the front desk and I'm </v>

1171
00:50:41.561 --> 00:50:41.561
<v Speaker 2>not mildly retarded.</v>

1172
00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:46.160
<v Speaker 2>What's great is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1173
00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:51.540
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the message is so incoherent that he </v>

1174
00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:51.830
<v Speaker 2>sent me that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1175
00:50:51.831 --> 00:50:56.831
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you sure if I forwarded this to </v>

1176
00:50:56.831 --> 00:50:56.831
<v Speaker 2>someone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They might take my side.</v>

1177
00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:02.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is such a crazy fucking story.</v>

1178
00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:03.530
<v Speaker 2>So from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you.</v>

1179
00:51:03.531 --> 00:51:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Were you there for a weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like did you have to do stand up there?</v>

1180
00:51:05.991 --> 00:51:08.930
<v Speaker 2>The rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was performing at whitman college that</v>

1181
00:51:08.931 --> 00:51:13.931
<v Speaker 2>night and then I was performing at </v>
<v Speaker 2>university of Oregon the next day and I </v>

1182
00:51:13.931 --> 00:51:17.030
<v Speaker 2>actually did the gig with all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brokenness and I didn't tell anybody.</v>

1183
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:22.150
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just did the gig to understand </v>

1184
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.700
<v Speaker 2>that the money you're broke and you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>just mangled cut up.</v>

1185
00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.510
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing messed with my face up so no one</v>

1186
00:51:26.511 --> 00:51:28.340
<v Speaker 2>could tell I was wearing long sleeves </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything.</v>

1187
00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:31.550
<v Speaker 2>That's so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievably fortunate.</v>

1188
00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:32.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>

1189
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:33.890
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

1190
00:51:33.891 --> 00:51:38.891
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a moment in my life where I was </v>

1191
00:51:38.891 --> 00:51:38.891
<v Speaker 2>broke.</v>

1192
00:51:38.891 --> 00:51:41.590
<v Speaker 2>I was hustling so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all factored into the jump through </v>

1193
00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:42.650
<v Speaker 2>the window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was dealing with a lot of anxiety.</v>

1194
00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.970
<v Speaker 2>So the anxiety and the stress manifests </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself in the sleepwalking.</v>

1195
00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1196
00:51:46.521 --> 00:51:51.521
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm diagnosed with rem behavior </v>

1197
00:51:51.521 --> 00:51:51.521
<v Speaker 2>disorder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a chemical imbalance.</v>

1198
00:51:51.521 --> 00:51:55.691
<v Speaker 2>It means people who have a dope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people who have a dopamine </v>

1199
00:51:55.691 --> 00:51:56.540
<v Speaker 2>deficiency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the chemical that's released in</v>

1200
00:51:56.541 --> 00:51:58.310
<v Speaker 2>your brain and your body when you fall </v>
<v Speaker 2>asleep,</v>

1201
00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.460
<v Speaker 2>that paralyzes your body so you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>act out your dreams.</v>

1202
00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:05.930
<v Speaker 2>That's essentially what happens when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep is your body's paralyzed.</v>

1203
00:52:05.931 --> 00:52:10.931
<v Speaker 2>You can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a dopamine deficiency and as a </v>

1204
00:52:10.931 --> 00:52:13.520
<v Speaker 2>result I act out my dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so since then I was diagnosed,</v>

1205
00:52:13.521 --> 00:52:18.521
<v Speaker 2>so I take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't tell people that I take by </v>

1206
00:52:18.521 --> 00:52:19.190
<v Speaker 2>take an antianxiety yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1207
00:52:19.191 --> 00:52:24.191
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it calms me down and then I don't </v>

1208
00:52:24.191 --> 00:52:26.960
<v Speaker 2>feel like I need in my dreams to run </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from things like why do you say you</v>

1209
00:52:26.961 --> 00:52:28.100
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't tell people what you take?</v>

1210
00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm not a doctor,</v>

1211
00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:33.500
<v Speaker 2>so I don't want to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want people to self diagnose and</v>

1212
00:52:33.501 --> 00:52:33.860
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1213
00:52:33.861 --> 00:52:36.020
<v Speaker 2>I have that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like you don't really know.</v>

1214
00:52:36.021 --> 00:52:38.450
<v Speaker 2>I did a sleep study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I slept overnight at the hotel,</v>

1215
00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:42.140
<v Speaker 2>at the hospital for nights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they really know what I have.</v>

1216
00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's very responsible of you.</v>

1217
00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1218
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:50.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you start taking this </v>

1219
00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:53.110
<v Speaker 2>medication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you're taking this </v>

1220
00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:53.110
<v Speaker 2>medication,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still don't trust yourself.</v>

1221
00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:54.080
<v Speaker 2>You stills up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1222
00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:56.210
<v Speaker 2>kinda like a condom over a birth control</v>
<v Speaker 2>pill.</v>

1223
00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1224
00:52:57.681 --> 00:52:59.430
<v Speaker 2>I guess once you jump out of a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>window,</v>

1225
00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:06.470
<v Speaker 2>got to get some reinforcement bars over </v>
<v Speaker 2>your windows.</v>

1226
00:53:06.471 --> 00:53:07.910
<v Speaker 2>Mandy worried about break ins?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

1227
00:53:07.911 --> 00:53:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Breakouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breakouts.</v>

1228
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.730
<v Speaker 2>The crazy breakouts we're trying to keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>it in.</v>

1229
00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1230
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:18.080
<v Speaker 2>And so by taking an anti anxiety </v>
<v Speaker 2>medication,</v>

1231
00:53:18.081 --> 00:53:21.410
<v Speaker 2>has that changed you like your regular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday life?</v>

1232
00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:23.160
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to think no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1233
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:25.800
<v Speaker 2>I fear sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like,</v>

1234
00:53:25.801 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1235
00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:26.640
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1236
00:53:26.641 --> 00:53:29.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like what I take for a while,</v>

1237
00:53:29.221 --> 00:53:32.040
<v Speaker 1>it felt like it made me a bit fuzzy </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling when I wake up in the morning.</v>

1238
00:53:32.041 --> 00:53:34.530
<v Speaker 1>I have to drink a lot of coffee to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to regular,</v>

1239
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:36.690
<v Speaker 1>which I don't love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1240
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.180
<v Speaker 1>And it's all because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1241
00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Is there any natural cure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that you've been going</v>

1242
00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:44.360
<v Speaker 1>to a holistic doctor recently who's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>given for as though.</v>

1243
00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think that's good?</v>

1244
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just always say that holistic doctor,</v>

1245
00:53:48.961 --> 00:53:51.600
<v Speaker 1>all those motherfuckers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she took a,</v>

1246
00:53:51.810 --> 00:53:56.810
<v Speaker 1>she took like a 10 vials of blood and </v>
<v Speaker 1>did a whole thing on which vitamins I </v>

1247
00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:58.360
<v Speaker 1>should take to counterbalance things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1248
00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:00.720
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that's leveling me off a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

1249
00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.660
<v Speaker 1>Would you watch your diet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you fairly healthy?</v>

1250
00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1251
00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Trying to have protein in the morning </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>

1252
00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:10.460
<v Speaker 1>But do you like gluten?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm trying to wean myself off of it.</v>

1253
00:54:11.070 --> 00:54:14.100
<v Speaker 1>You eat gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped about six months ago.</v>

1254
00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:15.630
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot better.</v>

1255
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped when I was filming this show.</v>

1256
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:23.390
<v Speaker 1>I was having back problems from jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that this woman </v>

1257
00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:25.200
<v Speaker 1>who's a physical therapist told me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said real good results.</v>

1258
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:30.180
<v Speaker 1>People that have injuries getting off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>gluten reduces inflammation and in a lot</v>

1259
00:54:30.181 --> 00:54:33.000
<v Speaker 1>of the symptoms of the injuries subside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1260
00:54:33.001 --> 00:54:33.600
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

1261
00:54:33.601 --> 00:54:38.601
<v Speaker 1>you can tell me like bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like stopping bread makes an injury </v>

1262
00:54:38.601 --> 00:54:38.601
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>

1263
00:54:38.601 --> 00:54:39.990
<v Speaker 1>you really would be amazed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1264
00:54:39.991 --> 00:54:41.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried it and uh,</v>

1265
00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my injury got better,</v>

1266
00:54:44.791 --> 00:54:49.791
<v Speaker 1>like slowly petroleum its own through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of different therapies that I was </v>

1267
00:54:49.791 --> 00:54:50.550
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what was amazing was my energy level</v>

1268
00:54:50.551 --> 00:54:51.030
<v Speaker 1>is different.</v>

1269
00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.640
<v Speaker 1>My energy level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially after meals.</v>

1270
00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:55.470
<v Speaker 1>That was the most shocking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I would,</v>

1271
00:54:55.770 --> 00:55:00.770
<v Speaker 1>I eat so much bread and pasta and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was realized that like after I had </v>

1272
00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:06.230
<v Speaker 1>eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like I got hit with a </v>

1273
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:06.230
<v Speaker 1>tranquilizer dart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought that's what it was.</v>

1274
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I thought I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what happens after you eat.</v>

1275
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Eating is like sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no man,</v>

1276
00:55:10.831 --> 00:55:14.250
<v Speaker 1>not now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I eat and after I'm done eating,</v>

1277
00:55:14.251 --> 00:55:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm full but I'm not in a coma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1278
00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:21.610
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a totally different experience for </v>

1279
00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:23.931
<v Speaker 1>me because my basically my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm italian mostly and most of my</v>

1280
00:55:24.031 --> 00:55:29.031
<v Speaker 1>life I grew up eating like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating pasta and bread with every meal </v>

1281
00:55:29.031 --> 00:55:31.320
<v Speaker 1>and when I stopped eating it it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1282
00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:33.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1283
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:38.630
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what had been dealing with my </v>

1284
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.630
<v Speaker 1>whole life for no reason.</v>

1285
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Like every time I eat I would eat these </v>
<v Speaker 1>big giant meals.</v>

1286
00:55:39.781 --> 00:55:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1287
00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:44.910
<v Speaker 1>I just kicked back and I know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling that don't get that anymore.</v>

1288
00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Now I eat and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously my body's digesting,</v>

1289
00:55:47.941 --> 00:55:52.650
<v Speaker 1>I feel full and I don't feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sedated los angeles is great for that.</v>

1290
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:55.470
<v Speaker 1>New york is good for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like when you travel,</v>

1291
00:55:55.471 --> 00:55:57.270
<v Speaker 1>do you have a hard time finding the food</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you want?</v>

1292
00:55:57.271 --> 00:55:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Steak and salad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steak salad,</v>

1293
00:55:59.581 --> 00:56:04.581
<v Speaker 1>chicken salad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not ridiculous about it because I </v>

1294
00:56:04.581 --> 00:56:06.000
<v Speaker 1>don't have celiac's disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like a half to avoid it.</v>

1295
00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.020
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something is breaded or you know,</v>

1296
00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:10.740
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't kill me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

1297
00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:12.990
<v Speaker 1>it just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it sets me back a little bit.</v>

1298
00:56:13.830 --> 00:56:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I think your body's not designed to pro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wheat that we eat today is very </v>

1299
00:56:19.801 --> 00:56:24.801
<v Speaker 1>different from the wheat that people had</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 years ago in the 19 fifties and </v>

1300
00:56:24.801 --> 00:56:26.890
<v Speaker 1>sixties is when they started engineering</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheat to be more hardy,</v>

1301
00:56:26.891 --> 00:56:31.891
<v Speaker 1>so for better yields and so it could </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive pesticides and whatnot and that </v>

1302
00:56:31.891 --> 00:56:34.240
<v Speaker 1>we is much more difficult for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>process just is.</v>

1303
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:36.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a fact that's a science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1304
00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:37.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is science behind that.</v>

1305
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:40.120
<v Speaker 1>So when people talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1306
00:56:40.121 --> 00:56:41.770
<v Speaker 1>it's just another fad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just another fad.</v>

1307
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.680
<v Speaker 1>It's actually not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1308
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:45.550
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were most certainly fads,</v>

1309
00:56:45.551 --> 00:56:46.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as,</v>

1310
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:52.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the atkins diet and all these </v>

1311
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.390
<v Speaker 1>various diets that can work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1312
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:53.230
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can have an effect,</v>

1313
00:56:53.231 --> 00:56:55.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go into ketosis,</v>

1314
00:56:55.451 --> 00:57:00.451
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's called and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body starts burning fat instead of </v>

1315
00:57:00.451 --> 00:57:01.510
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates and I tried that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like it at all.</v>

1316
00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:06.690
<v Speaker 1>This is very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This to me seems like cutting out </v>

1317
00:57:06.690 --> 00:57:07.360
<v Speaker 1>something that my body really just </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't enjoy process.</v>

1318
00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

1319
00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I still look,</v>

1320
00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a perfect eater.</v>

1321
00:57:12.041 --> 00:57:14.260
<v Speaker 1>I still eat ice cream and I still drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>milk.</v>

1322
00:57:14.261 --> 00:57:15.190
<v Speaker 1>And what do you do about pizza?</v>

1323
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Gluten free pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1324
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:17.580
<v Speaker 1>I try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's dark shit.</v>

1325
00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:22.640
<v Speaker 1>It's dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had pizza in alongside format </v>

1326
00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:22.640
<v Speaker 1>to have pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1327
00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:27.061
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had pizza and like it's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least six or seven months since I've </v>

1328
00:57:27.061 --> 00:57:27.970
<v Speaker 1>had except some gluten free pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was uh,</v>

1329
00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:29.490
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1330
00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:34.520
<v Speaker 1>I made a tweet about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said I'm having gluten free pizza and </v>

1331
00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:34.520
<v Speaker 1>to let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to,</v>

1332
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:36.730
<v Speaker 1>don't ever just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not pizza,</v>

1333
00:57:36.731 --> 00:57:41.731
<v Speaker 1>it's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone said there's a good kind out </v>

1334
00:57:41.731 --> 00:57:44.431
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that just builds fucking </v>

1335
00:57:44.431 --> 00:57:44.431
<v Speaker 1>people that don't want to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1336
00:57:44.431 --> 00:57:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1337
00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:50.320
<v Speaker 1>as far as like health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the majority of people don't get</v>

1338
00:57:50.321 --> 00:57:55.321
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big issue I think as far as </v>

1339
00:57:55.321 --> 00:57:57.230
<v Speaker 1>nutrition is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is green leafy vegetables and uh,</v>

1340
00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:57.780
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1341
00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:01.030
<v Speaker 1>and lots of vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People just don't eat enough vegetables.</v>

1342
00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:04.390
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't eat enough vegetables </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you also don't take vitamins.</v>

1343
00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

1344
00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:11.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's just basically operating on </v>

1345
00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:14.110
<v Speaker 1>proteins and carbohydrates and whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck it can find,</v>

1346
00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:19.140
<v Speaker 1>but you're not getting enough vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just not like the idea of a </v>

1347
00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:22.531
<v Speaker 1>balanced diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people's diet or they're not even </v>

1348
00:58:22.531 --> 00:58:24.250
<v Speaker 1>close to balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like I've watched friends like,</v>

1349
00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:25.660
<v Speaker 1>been like on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the road,</v>

1350
00:58:25.661 --> 00:58:27.640
<v Speaker 1>like comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been with them for every meal,</v>

1351
00:58:27.790 --> 00:58:32.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've watched what they eat and like </v>

1352
00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:34.521
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting anywhere like you </v>

1353
00:58:34.521 --> 00:58:34.521
<v Speaker 1>got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got an egg in there.</v>

1354
00:58:34.521 --> 00:58:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some bread in that.</v>

1355
00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a piece of lettuce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

1356
00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:38.740
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck you getting your vitamins</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

1357
00:58:38.741 --> 00:58:39.280
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1358
00:58:39.610 --> 00:58:43.060
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm in that boat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you take supplements?</v>

1359
00:58:43.061 --> 00:58:45.400
<v Speaker 1>You take vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just started to like two months ago.</v>

1360
00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Just started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1361
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:49.960
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so disappointed.</v>

1362
00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:51.050
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

1363
00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:56.070
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you notice a difference once you </v>

1364
00:58:56.070 --> 00:58:56.960
<v Speaker 1>started taking vitamins?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1365
00:58:56.961 --> 00:58:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel better.</v>

1366
00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:00.370
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's on starving.</v>

1367
00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your vitamin starved.</v>

1368
00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I invited him and starved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1369
00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:09.240
<v Speaker 1>but most of us are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you eat the average quote unquote </v>

1370
00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.090
<v Speaker 1>average american diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your vitamin starved.</v>

1371
00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1372
00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:16.830
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to travel and be healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is what I started doing nights or </v>

1373
00:59:17.081 --> 00:59:19.900
<v Speaker 1>doing yoga and I travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel better.</v>

1374
00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 1>I feel a lot better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because of all the girls</v>

1375
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.260
<v Speaker 2>that yoga pants in the class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you feel better too.</v>

1376
00:59:24.350 --> 00:59:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Excited.</v>

1377
00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm misunderstanding the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1378
00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:34.260
<v Speaker 2>No yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could just go to the yoga pants or.</v>

1379
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just go to a strip club and you </v>

1380
00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:39.340
<v Speaker 2>feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1381
00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:39.340
<v Speaker 2>I started going to strip clubs in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>road and I just,</v>

1382
00:59:39.340 --> 00:59:39.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

1383
00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:44.570
<v Speaker 2>it really picked me be I wrote down a </v>

1392
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:15.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't talk to guys who come here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

1396
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:21.320
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

1397
01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:22.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's an open door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1398
01:00:22.791 --> 01:00:24.470
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice people can come through too.</v>

1399
01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:25.940
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1400
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.490
<v Speaker 2>most guys who come here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only come here for one reason.</v>

1401
01:00:28.491 --> 01:00:29.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did you come here?</v>

1402
01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:32.480
<v Speaker 2>Like she was shutting me down and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1403
01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:37.530
<v Speaker 2>because someone told me there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>place that I could do go where I could </v>

1404
01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:37.880
<v Speaker 2>see a strange girl's pussy for a dollar.</v>

1405
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:42.680
<v Speaker 2>And that was the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1406
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm the asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only did it show up where you work,</v>

1407
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:51.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a bad person because you work </v>

1408
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.950
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1409
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:54.260
<v Speaker 2>different people go to different places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different reasons to go to strip clubs a</v>

1410
01:00:54.261 --> 01:00:54.820
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1411
01:00:54.821 --> 01:00:57.230
<v Speaker 2>it turned me off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in nashville once,</v>

1412
01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:00.140
<v Speaker 2>I saw a commercial on tv for a strip </v>
<v Speaker 2>club and I was like,</v>

1413
01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:01.730
<v Speaker 2>I would like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems fun.</v>

1414
01:01:01.731 --> 01:01:03.630
<v Speaker 2>I'll go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1415
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.840
<v Speaker 2>and they went and then I gave the guy my</v>
<v Speaker 2>id when I walked in and he goes,</v>

1416
01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:13.760
<v Speaker 2>hey mike birbiglia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like your comedy.</v>

1417
01:01:13.761 --> 01:01:15.920
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to a strip club again.</v>

1418
01:01:15.921 --> 01:01:17.150
<v Speaker 2>I've never gone back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1419
01:01:17.151 --> 01:01:20.290
<v Speaker 2>Because I liked the anonymity of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be,</v>

1420
01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:24.940
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anyone to watch me watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone beating it.</v>

1421
01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:25.750
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

1422
01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:26.750
<v Speaker 2>I can't handle that.</v>

1423
01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:31.900
<v Speaker 2>You need a wig and a fake mustache and </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a wig or a fake mustache </v>

1424
01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:33.500
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in hollywood.</v>

1425
01:01:33.501 --> 01:01:35.450
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of stores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1426
01:01:35.451 --> 01:01:36.830
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I'm here.</v>

1427
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:43.270
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took so long for me to get to the </v>

1428
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.270
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1429
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:46.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have like a costume I can wear </v>

1430
01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:48.040
<v Speaker 2>because I'm really want to go guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

1431
01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:48.750
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1432
01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:54.280
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny you should say that about </v>

1433
01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:54.280
<v Speaker 2>you're asking like why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>

1434
01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:58.480
<v Speaker 2>why the woman was there and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's when I used to go to </v>

1435
01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:01.721
<v Speaker 2>strip clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was what I was most interested in </v>

1436
01:02:01.721 --> 01:02:01.721
<v Speaker 2>the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to know the story.</v>

1437
01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:05.050
<v Speaker 2>How did you get here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe,</v>

1438
01:02:05.090 --> 01:02:07.420
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's kind of mean spirited and </v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly,</v>

1439
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:09.650
<v Speaker 2>but I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is interesting to me.</v>

1440
01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's mean spirited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1441
01:02:11.631 --> 01:02:15.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can have a look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have been to many a strip club with my</v>

1442
01:02:15.411 --> 01:02:19.220
<v Speaker 2>dad and I've had some fun conversations </v>
<v Speaker 2>with girls who are dancers.</v>

1443
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:20.280
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't</v>

1444
01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>demeaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't meant it respectfully.</v>

1445
01:02:23.791 --> 01:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>When I would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very nice people,</v>

1446
01:02:25.621 --> 01:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>they just happen to be dancers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with it,</v>

1447
01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:32.661
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a weird sort of a </v>

1448
01:02:32.661 --> 01:02:34.971
<v Speaker 1>connection between standup comics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>strippers anyway because they were.</v>

1449
01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Our worlds are so odd in comparison to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the average person,</v>

1450
01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>oddly similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in a lot of ways.</v>

1451
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because standup comedy,</v>

1452
01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>you're as naked as you can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1453
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>Verbally and you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about your life,</v>

1454
01:02:49.110 --> 01:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>the best comedians essentially as you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching them make it a certain way.</v>

1455
01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1456
01:02:55.541 --> 01:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>and that's obviously the strippers who </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally.</v>

1457
01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're also living this weird </v>

1458
01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:03.450
<v Speaker 1>alternative life that most people can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to it.</v>

1459
01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Most people with nine to five jobs can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to.</v>

1460
01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1461
01:03:07.411 --> 01:03:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Like if you did a stripper and she comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>over your house at 3:00</v>

1462
01:03:09.781 --> 01:03:14.781
<v Speaker 1>in the morning after she gets off work </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she's got a little glitter bag full </v>

1463
01:03:14.781 --> 01:03:16.380
<v Speaker 1>of money and it's like we're both weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1464
01:03:16.381 --> 01:03:21.381
<v Speaker 1>I just got done telling jokes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking on stage and here you got off </v>

1465
01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:21.381
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

1466
01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:26.120
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're weird lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being an actor is a weird life if you </v>

1467
01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:26.220
<v Speaker 1>didn't act or strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1468
01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:30.020
<v Speaker 1>but in a more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a less naked way.</v>

1469
01:03:30.021 --> 01:03:31.260
<v Speaker 1>And your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriends,</v>

1470
01:03:31.261 --> 01:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>like making out with some guy in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1471
01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>True work over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

1472
01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.740
<v Speaker 1>After take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that.</v>

1473
01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:40.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that before.</v>

1474
01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:46.580
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people like watch their wives </v>
<v Speaker 1>or girlfriends a make out with other </v>

1475
01:03:46.771 --> 01:03:51.771
<v Speaker 1>guys like tongue and everything and </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch him and watch her and watch him </v>

1476
01:03:51.771 --> 01:03:53.070
<v Speaker 1>and watch her and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that.</v>

1477
01:03:53.310 --> 01:03:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the acting thing is like the </v>

1478
01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:00.351
<v Speaker 1>opposite of being naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like putting on a fucking outfit </v>

1479
01:04:00.351 --> 01:04:00.351
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think so?</v>

1480
01:04:00.351 --> 01:04:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's naked at all.</v>

1481
01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:06.170
<v Speaker 1>I think the acting is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is putting on armor that's putting on </v>

1482
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:10.880
<v Speaker 1>this armor of this bullshit character </v>
<v Speaker 1>that some writer created and you're </v>

1483
01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.660
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be this person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas.</v>

1484
01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:17.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the best ones are opening </v>

1485
01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:17.690
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opening up.</v>

1486
01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:18.030
<v Speaker 1>They're opening up their souls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the best ones,</v>

1487
01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:21.930
<v Speaker 1>the best actors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they become that guy,</v>

1488
01:04:21.931 --> 01:04:23.400
<v Speaker 1>but I mean like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1489
01:04:23.401 --> 01:04:26.520
<v Speaker 1>here's a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A christian bale in the machinist.</v>

1490
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.540
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't really an anorexic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the.</v>

1491
01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Couldn't sleep and he forced himself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

1492
01:04:33.181 --> 01:04:36.540
<v Speaker 1>He just became that guy for that role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

1493
01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:37.050
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1494
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.650
<v Speaker 1>it was an affectation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He put it on.</v>

1495
01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.750
<v Speaker 1>It was a costume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

1496
01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:44.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a role he played.</v>

1497
01:04:44.911 --> 01:04:47.880
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't him who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He decided to be me.</v>

1498
01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:52.940
<v Speaker 1>We can find areas in ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the weirdest fucking that </v>

1499
01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:57.660
<v Speaker 1>is so weird that he was bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's him next to batman when he was </v>

1500
01:04:58.771 --> 01:05:02.010
<v Speaker 1>fucking swole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is only like six months later.</v>

1501
01:05:02.011 --> 01:05:04.770
<v Speaker 1>I think the one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the photo on the left is real.</v>

1502
01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1503
01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:06.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1504
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:11.750
<v Speaker 1>He starved himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ate like a can of tuna and an apple </v>

1505
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:15.190
<v Speaker 1>like every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all he ate and he got down to an </v>

1506
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:18.501
<v Speaker 1>insanely small size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was to like 130 pounds or </v>

1507
01:05:18.611 --> 01:05:23.611
<v Speaker 1>something ridiculous like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a big guy and then he went up to </v>

1508
01:05:23.611 --> 01:05:25.510
<v Speaker 1>200 plus when he played batman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1509
01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty nuts,</v>

1510
01:05:27.641 --> 01:05:29.950
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1511
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.870
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thing that they do.</v>

1512
01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Like I just got back from last week and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw dallas buyers club here.</v>

1513
01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Matthew mcconaughey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking fantastic.</v>

1514
01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

1515
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:45.630
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who always shits on </v>
<v Speaker 1>matthew mcconaughey and thinks that </v>

1516
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:45.940
<v Speaker 1>matthew mcconaughey's correcting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible.</v>

1517
01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Matthew mcconaughey is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his ego is transparent and is acting.</v>

1518
01:05:49.661 --> 01:05:52.370
<v Speaker 1>It's mostly because my friends in actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

1519
01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:53.590
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1520
01:05:53.591 --> 01:05:58.591
<v Speaker 1>you got to watch dallas buyers club and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then shut the fuck up because the guy </v>

1521
01:05:58.591 --> 01:05:59.350
<v Speaker 1>knocks it out of the park is fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

1522
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I saw two movies this weekend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw,</v>

1523
01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I saw the catching fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked it with catching fire.</v>

1524
01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:10.030
<v Speaker 1>The hunger games movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How dare you say that?</v>

1525
01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Why nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1526
01:06:11.681 --> 01:06:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Everybody makes fun of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like gravity.</v>

1527
01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:15.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was good.</v>

1528
01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.690
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1529
01:06:16.691 --> 01:06:18.850
<v Speaker 1>you know what I thought was fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>about gravity,</v>

1530
01:06:18.851 --> 01:06:23.740
<v Speaker 1>which watching neil degrasse tyson a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweet about everything that's wrong,</v>

1531
01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:29.380
<v Speaker 1>the movie and then watching people </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack him because I saw a lot of that </v>

1532
01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:35.490
<v Speaker 1>because neil degrasse tyson is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's one of those guys that I don't </v>

1533
01:06:35.490 --> 01:06:37.200
<v Speaker 1>think ever takes heat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1534
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:40.450
<v Speaker 1>because he's such a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so brilliant.</v>

1535
01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:45.600
<v Speaker 1>He's so well informed about the ways of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe and so excellent at </v>

1536
01:06:46.721 --> 01:06:51.721
<v Speaker 1>expressing himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the best representatives of </v>

1537
01:06:51.721 --> 01:06:54.910
<v Speaker 1>science I think we have today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he always gets love everywhere.</v>

1538
01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:58.330
<v Speaker 1>He goes like everybody's all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet memes of pictures of him.</v>

1539
01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Then this came out and he starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>correcting the movie and the fucking </v>

1540
01:07:05.111 --> 01:07:10.111
<v Speaker 1>hate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't correct a Sandra Bullock </v>

1541
01:07:10.111 --> 01:07:10.111
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just can't.</v>

1542
01:07:10.111 --> 01:07:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't hate on Sandra Bullock.</v>

1543
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:13.350
<v Speaker 1>They fucking went after him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1544
01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:18.840
<v Speaker 1>neil degrasse tyson says his criticisms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of gravity or a compliment to its </v>

1545
01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:19.150
<v Speaker 1>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

1546
01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:20.890
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because he took.</v>

1547
01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:25.920
<v Speaker 1>I took the hit the right to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To earn the right to be criticized as a </v>

1548
01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:29.620
<v Speaker 1>high compliment indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1549
01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like a guy fucking feeling </v>

1550
01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:36.150
<v Speaker 1>the heat talking nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling the heat.</v>

1551
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Some people criticize the story of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie and I was like,</v>

1552
01:07:38.801 --> 01:07:43.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like 10 minutes in I was like,</v>

1553
01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I got my $15 worth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought that I'd know what it </v>

1554
01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:48.480
<v Speaker 1>felt like to go to space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1555
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:51.100
<v Speaker 1>I love the fact that everything was </v>
<v Speaker 1>silent.</v>

1556
01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like in the middle of the </v>

1557
01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:56.550
<v Speaker 1>explosions and all this shit.</v>

1558
01:07:56.550 --> 01:07:59.940
<v Speaker 1>It's silent and yet you're still </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking the fuck out is actually more </v>

1559
01:07:59.940 --> 01:07:59.940
<v Speaker 1>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought.</v>

1560
01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:01.840
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the director's movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Children of men.</v>

1561
01:08:02.530 --> 01:08:03.580
<v Speaker 1>Children of men?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1562
01:08:03.581 --> 01:08:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1563
01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:09.120
<v Speaker 1>That was the one where people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the males are like,</v>

1564
01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.990
<v Speaker 1>the people can't breed or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1565
01:08:10.991 --> 01:08:11.900
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1566
01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:13.390
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1567
01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:16.430
<v Speaker 1>the thing that I found was most </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating about gravity,</v>

1568
01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the,</v>

1569
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:23.110
<v Speaker 1>just the idea that people do really go </v>
<v Speaker 1>up there and really do stay up there for</v>

1570
01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:29.240
<v Speaker 1>long periods of time and space and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>really are in grave danger and they </v>

1571
01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:31.430
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this possibility of things colliding and</v>

1572
01:08:31.431 --> 01:08:34.130
<v Speaker 1>space junk to very real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real problem.</v>

1573
01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fucking thousands of things </v>

1574
01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:39.160
<v Speaker 1>floating around above the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands.</v>

1575
01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.470
<v Speaker 1>It's so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love,</v>

1576
01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I'd love john august,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the screenwriter made this point that I </v>

1577
01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:48.461
<v Speaker 1>think is of brilliant about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what's exciting about the </v>

1578
01:08:48.461 --> 01:08:48.461
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

1579
01:08:48.461 --> 01:08:53.020
<v Speaker 1>It's $100 million dollar movie major </v>
<v Speaker 1>budget movie where the lead character </v>

1580
01:08:53.631 --> 01:08:57.350
<v Speaker 1>doesn't save the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just saves herself.</v>

1581
01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1582
01:08:59.811 --> 01:09:04.811
<v Speaker 1>What people didn't like to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people didn't like the george </v>

1583
01:09:04.811 --> 01:09:07.270
<v Speaker 1>clooney guy because it was just so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing was when he lets go </v>

1584
01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:09.200
<v Speaker 1>when he has to let go because it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling him away.</v>

1585
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:12.000
<v Speaker 1>There's no momentum in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People said the science if it's wrong.</v>

1586
01:09:12.001 --> 01:09:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science is so wrong.</v>

1587
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:15.840
<v Speaker 1>I was fine with that though because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know much about science.</v>

1588
01:09:16.650 --> 01:09:18.560
<v Speaker 1>The science is not just wrong about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1589
01:09:18.561 --> 01:09:21.470
<v Speaker 1>it's also wrong about the positions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the various space stations,</v>

1590
01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:23.960
<v Speaker 1>like they're not anywhere near each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

1591
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Like what she did by skipping from one </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the next would be absolutely </v>

1592
01:09:29.631 --> 01:09:34.631
<v Speaker 1>completely impossible there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not in the same hemisphere that </v>

1593
01:09:34.631 --> 01:09:35.090
<v Speaker 1>nowhere near to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just gave it the benefit,</v>

1594
01:09:35.091 --> 01:09:40.091
<v Speaker 1>the benefit of the doubt because she had</v>
<v Speaker 1>that weird divorce because of Jesse </v>

1595
01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:41.180
<v Speaker 1>James.</v>

1596
01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:42.770
<v Speaker 1>He gave this movie the benefit of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt.</v>

1597
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:48.070
<v Speaker 1>That's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll let it go with the science stuff </v>

1598
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.070
<v Speaker 1>just because she's had a hard time last </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years.</v>

1599
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sweet of you.</v>

1600
01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm,</v>

1601
01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:51.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1602
01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of anything space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think space is probably the most </v>

1603
01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:56.520
<v Speaker 1>overlooked thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating.</v>

1604
01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.730
<v Speaker 1>The history of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

1605
01:09:58.850 --> 01:10:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Which still have enough light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel that way about the see the </v>

1606
01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:03.850
<v Speaker 1>season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other one.</v>

1607
01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sea and space are the two most </v>

1608
01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:08.080
<v Speaker 1>interesting places I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1609
01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.640
<v Speaker 1>the sea less so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still pretty fucking fascinating.</v>

1610
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:15.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basically like a jungle or </v>

1611
01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:15.850
<v Speaker 1>underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved what you were tweeting the other</v>

1612
01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:17.780
<v Speaker 1>day about black fish because I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a great cause.</v>

1613
01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had the filled dimmers who was a </v>

1614
01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:24.740
<v Speaker 1>trainer over at seaworld or whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 1>heck it was,</v>

1615
01:10:24.741 --> 01:10:26.780
<v Speaker 1>marine land in Canada.</v>

1616
01:10:27.230 --> 01:10:29.690
<v Speaker 1>That was depressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's miserable,</v>

1617
01:10:29.691 --> 01:10:32.240
<v Speaker 1>but it's good that you're tweeting about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because it's a good cause.</v>

1618
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1619
01:10:33.531 --> 01:10:34.600
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1620
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I see life very fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intelligency life even more so.</v>

1621
01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:45.580
<v Speaker 1>I just think people are very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not funny or an item here or </v>

1622
01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:52.480
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just think people are generally </v>

1623
01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:55.510
<v Speaker 1>unwilling to accept sea life and animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>as having an intelligence that we just </v>

1624
01:10:56.181 --> 01:10:57.500
<v Speaker 1>don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1625
01:10:57.501 --> 01:10:59.600
<v Speaker 1>they certainly to mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt about it.</v>

1626
01:10:59.601 --> 01:11:04.601
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to people who understand </v>

1627
01:11:04.601 --> 01:11:04.840
<v Speaker 1>orcas are or dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very intelligent.</v>

1628
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just intelligent in a different way </v>

1629
01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:09.850
<v Speaker 1>because they don't alter their </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

1630
01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:14.050
<v Speaker 1>And as we were talking about space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how fascinating spaces that the </v>

1631
01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:18.381
<v Speaker 1>real issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we treat intelligent lifeforms on </v>

1632
01:11:18.381 --> 01:11:19.200
<v Speaker 1>this planet that we can understand the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that we do,</v>

1633
01:11:19.290 --> 01:11:21.570
<v Speaker 1>especially helpless ones essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>help us once,</v>

1634
01:11:21.571 --> 01:11:26.100
<v Speaker 1>like orcas and dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really can't do anything to prevent</v>

1635
01:11:26.101 --> 01:11:28.230
<v Speaker 1>us from doing what we want them to do.</v>

1636
01:11:28.540 --> 01:11:30.660
<v Speaker 1>It really can't prevent us from </v>
<v Speaker 1>kidnapping them.</v>

1637
01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:33.270
<v Speaker 1>They can just try to run away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't fight back.</v>

1638
01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:35.850
<v Speaker 1>They really can't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What w what?</v>

1639
01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.280
<v Speaker 1>What are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is an alien race going to do to us?</v>

1640
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:39.860
<v Speaker 1>If they ever get ahold of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1641
01:11:39.861 --> 01:11:44.861
<v Speaker 1>I'm so worried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they see how we treat intelligent </v>

1642
01:11:44.861 --> 01:11:44.861
<v Speaker 1>life forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they respect us?</v>

1643
01:11:44.861 --> 01:11:46.590
<v Speaker 1>Why would they want to do anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they?</v>

1644
01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Why would they be kind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would they give us information?</v>

1645
01:11:49.831 --> 01:11:52.650
<v Speaker 1>Why would they try to help us evolve?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd go,</v>

1646
01:11:52.710 --> 01:11:53.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to go.</v>

1647
01:11:53.850 --> 01:11:57.330
<v Speaker 1>Aliens is going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not an if it's a.</v>

1648
01:11:57.331 --> 01:12:00.960
<v Speaker 1>When when the aliens come or we arrive </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the aliens,</v>

1649
01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:04.590
<v Speaker 1>it's going to go one of two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We enslave them,</v>

1650
01:12:04.591 --> 01:12:06.000
<v Speaker 1>they enslave us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>

1651
01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:09.250
<v Speaker 1>that's the only version of what can </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen or we eat them or they know.</v>

1652
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fucked up.</v>

1653

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

1655
01:12:14.821 --> 01:12:19.821
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever get a chance when you do an all </v>

01:12:19.821 --> 01:12:21.921
<v Speaker 1>your travel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever get a chance to go to any </v>

1657
01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:23.100
<v Speaker 1>observatories?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cat in Hawaii or you know,</v>

1658
01:12:23.101 --> 01:12:25.960
<v Speaker 1>any of the telescopes I tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1659
01:12:26.130 --> 01:12:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done it recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1660
01:12:27.391 --> 01:12:32.391
<v Speaker 1>I tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most life changing things </v>

1661
01:12:32.391 --> 01:12:33.080
<v Speaker 1>I've ever done besides psychedelic drugs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having kids is a,</v>

1662
01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:35.580
<v Speaker 1>going to the keck observatory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is that?</v>

1663
01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:37.630
<v Speaker 1>It's on the big island of Hawaii.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1664
01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.700
<v Speaker 1>the fucking view of the stars is so mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>blowing.</v>

1665
01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:44.550
<v Speaker 1>You can't believe it's real because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1666
01:12:44.551 --> 01:12:46.830
<v Speaker 1>you're on the island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 9,000</v>

1667
01:12:46.831 --> 01:12:48.690
<v Speaker 1>feet above sea level as the visitors </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

1668
01:12:48.691 --> 01:12:51.970
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the main observatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is higher than that.</v>

1669
01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.810
<v Speaker 1>You're literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at the picture.</v>

1670
01:12:53.811 --> 01:12:56.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not evil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're above the clouds.</v>

1671
01:12:56.190 --> 01:12:59.670
<v Speaker 1>That's literally above the clouds as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were driving,</v>

1672
01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:00.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1673
01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:02.850
<v Speaker 1>I was with my family and we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1674
01:13:02.851 --> 01:13:03.440
<v Speaker 1>this sucks.</v>

1675
01:13:03.450 --> 01:13:04.980
<v Speaker 1>It's cloudy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to miss it.</v>

1676
01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:09.981
<v Speaker 1>This is not going to work because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna we're going to get up there and </v>

1677
01:13:09.981 --> 01:13:09.981
<v Speaker 1>we're not gonna be able to see through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the clouds,</v>

1678
01:13:09.981 --> 01:13:12.990
<v Speaker 1>but then you pass through the clouds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you look up.</v>

1679
01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's nothing with what you're saying.</v>

1680
01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing.</v>

1681
01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:20.130
<v Speaker 1>The only thing I can compare to this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alaska have ever been to Alaska.</v>

1682
01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.220
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like faire.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I highly recommend people listening to </v>

1684
01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:30.651
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been to Hawaii and I want to </v>

1685
01:13:30.651 --> 01:13:30.651
<v Speaker 1>go there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have never been to.</v>

1686
01:13:30.651 --> 01:13:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Alaska should go to Alaska if you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the man.</v>

1687
01:13:31.450 --> 01:13:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt,</v>

1688
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:33.380
<v Speaker 1>because it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sit,</v>

1689
01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:38.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call it the last frontier and </v>

1690
01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:38.420
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really is.</v>

1691
01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:41.690
<v Speaker 1>It's undiscovered areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's uncultivated areas and it's </v>

1692
01:13:41.690 --> 01:13:42.140
<v Speaker 1>stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1693
01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:45.680
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went salmon fishing with ari fear.</v>

1694
01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:51.020
<v Speaker 1>We went up there this year in july and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we caught salmon and did a gig up there </v>

1695
01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:53.070
<v Speaker 1>and I fell in love with the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

1696
01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Anchorage is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really fucking cool.</v>

1697
01:13:55.651 --> 01:13:57.040

<v Speaker 1>Like there's a.</v>

1698
01:13:57.330 --> 01:14:01.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a quality to the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>live up there because they're.</v>

1699
01:14:01.131 --> 01:14:03.240
<v Speaker 1>They're living in a legitimate </v>
<v Speaker 1>wilderness,</v>

1700
01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:07.710
<v Speaker 1>they have a city and that city is </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by absolute legit wilderness.</v>

1701
01:14:07.711 --> 01:14:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Like someone on the university of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anchorage campus last year got killed by</v>

1702
01:14:11.081 --> 01:14:12.040

<v Speaker 2>someone to death and that's like part of</v>

<v Speaker 2>very competitive.</v>

1707
01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's what it was about.</v>
