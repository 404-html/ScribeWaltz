1
00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.380
<v Speaker 1>Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:03.573
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:05.463
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a less than a month before </v>

4
00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Armageddon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

5
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.430
<v Speaker 1>we're here in the bunker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lovely Woodland Hills,</v>

6
00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:13.800
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Brian motherfucking Kaolin is here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>

8
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.210
<v Speaker 1>He's willing for Jill Stein because she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Brian wants 16 year olds to be able</v>

9
00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:23.044
<v Speaker 1>to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we both think it's super rational </v>

10
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.063
<v Speaker 1>and a great idea because no one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one better to decide the future of </v>

11
00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:34.330
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A hormonally flooded baby.</v>

12
00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about the boner?</v>

13
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.540
<v Speaker 1>What 18 year olds drinking instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>21?</v>

14
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.523
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with someone who is supervised who was </v>

15
00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:47.464
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is sort of mentored into having a </v>

16
00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:55.801
<v Speaker 1>couple of drinks with an intelligent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>very disciplined parental figure.</v>

17
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Like someone who's a smart dad or smart </v>
<v Speaker 1>mom who says,</v>

18
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.180
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to be.</v>

19
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.133
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it to be something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so out of reach that you wind up doing </v>

20
00:01:07.571 --> 00:01:09.730
<v Speaker 1>it and getting obsessed with it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the forbidden.</v>

21
00:01:09.731 --> 00:01:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Dang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a big deal.</v>

22
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about a drink or two?</v>

23
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

24
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>but they have to be like a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious parent.</v>

25
00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:20.080
<v Speaker 1>They should be there with the kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure no one's driving,</v>

26
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.280
<v Speaker 1>no stupid shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we all had beers before we were 21.</v>

27
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Everybody did all of us.</v>

28
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.533
<v Speaker 3>I also think that if you're going to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that responsibility to vote and </v>

29
00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:33.020
<v Speaker 3>they can carry the can join the army and</v>
<v Speaker 3>go and fight and die and kings give them</v>

30
00:01:33.021 --> 00:01:34.120
<v Speaker 3>a license to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

31
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.993
<v Speaker 3>It seems very strange to me that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not also allowed to vote and I mean I'm </v>

32
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:38.744
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drink because it used to be in I think </v>

33
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:42.980
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>
<v Speaker 3>84 is when the law changed.</v>

34
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.770
<v Speaker 3>You were able to drink?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

35
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.643
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like I missed it by just a few </v>

36
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 3>years fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

37
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

38
00:01:51.411 --> 00:01:53.930
<v Speaker 3>he did because 85.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 17,</v>

39
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.960
<v Speaker 3>so that was when I graduated high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

40
00:01:56.961 --> 00:02:00.680
<v Speaker 3>I think I was 18 and 85.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was drinking in college.</v>

41
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 3>Where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

43
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.703
<v Speaker 3>I drank in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I could drink in bars in Washington </v>

44
00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:05.720
<v Speaker 3>DC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember.</v>

45
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are different laws.</v>

46
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.560
<v Speaker 3>I was 18.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was an early 18,</v>

47
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.150
<v Speaker 3>January 26th.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so mature now who are mature.</v>

48
00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:16.160
<v Speaker 3>I say that about you all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so let's say for a grownup baby,</v>

49
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.890
<v Speaker 3>that's the attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking the other day at the,</v>

50
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.903
<v Speaker 3>at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we run down to this other part of </v>

51
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 3>the comedy store and there was a mirror </v>
<v Speaker 3>and both of us stop.</v>

52
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.740
<v Speaker 3>Look in the mirror and we pull our </v>
<v Speaker 3>shirts up and start flexing.</v>

53
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.850
<v Speaker 3>You start going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

54
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.080
<v Speaker 3>look at my stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at my.</v>

55
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.880
<v Speaker 3>Oh my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

56
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.713
<v Speaker 3>leaks as absent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then just as quickly through our </v>

57
00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:41.651
<v Speaker 3>shirts down and ran away as I was going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said I just barked were losers.</v>

58
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.260
<v Speaker 3>We're fucking losers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're babies,</v>

59
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.183
<v Speaker 3>we're going up babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but everybody is until you have so much </v>

60
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:51.950
<v Speaker 3>responsibility that you're beaten down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's no fun anymore.</v>

61
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.063
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I have figured out the </v>

62
00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 3>delineation there.</v>

63
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to be immature and we are and </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be silly geese,</v>

64
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.303
<v Speaker 3>but I think the difference is you become</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real adult and you become mature when </v>

65
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:07.534
<v Speaker 3>you have other people that rely on you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and where were other people's happiness </v>

66
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 3>to some degree is more important than </v>
<v Speaker 3>your own.</v>

67
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.513
<v Speaker 3>So you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and their development is causes you </v>

68
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 3>concern or angst and requires your time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sacrifice.</v>

69
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.953
<v Speaker 3>And if I could throw something in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way that silly goose stuff </v>

70
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 3>works at all as if you've got your bases</v>
<v Speaker 3>covered.</v>

71
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.461
<v Speaker 3>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

72
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:32.410
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really tough to be a silly goose if</v>

73
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.244
<v Speaker 3>you're behind on your taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have massive credit card debt </v>

74
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.620
<v Speaker 3>that you're ignoring or there's these </v>
<v Speaker 3>stacking stress things,</v>

75
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 3>these events,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

76
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:43.564
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

77
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.220
<v Speaker 3>factors in your life that can really get</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in your,</v>

78
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 3>your happiness and your silliness.</v>

79
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 3>So as long as you know your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your ducks are in a row,</v>

80
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 3>then you can kind of laugh a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's stuff.</v>

81
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've taken for granted the fact that we</v>

82
00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:56.794
<v Speaker 3>have figured out a way to preserve our </v>
<v Speaker 3>biology and most countries in terms of </v>

83
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:02.374
<v Speaker 3>like we have life saving medications or </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of preventions for keeping us from </v>

84
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 3>things like malaria and diptheria and </v>
<v Speaker 3>all those things that used to really.</v>

85
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.513
<v Speaker 3>Because when they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They always talk about when you go into </v>

86
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 3>a country and you want to get that </v>
<v Speaker 3>country on its feet and you want to help</v>

87
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:17.794
<v Speaker 3>develop that country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing you'd have to make sure </v>

88
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:23.080
<v Speaker 3>of is that people aren't suffering from </v>
<v Speaker 3>chronic illnesses,</v>

89
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.830
<v Speaker 3>parasites,</v>
<v Speaker 3>diseases that,</v>

90
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 3>that just make them feel shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got the right nutrition.</v>

91
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 3>So the first thing to do is take care of</v>
<v Speaker 3>your biology,</v>

92
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Speaker 3>take care of that.</v>

93
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sort of thing that you live in that</v>

94
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:35.764
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because otherwise if you don't feel </v>

95
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a little rudimentary things.</v>

96
00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 3>If you don't feel good like hookworm in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the south.</v>

97
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.670
<v Speaker 3>But when after World War,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

98
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>civil war was so endemic in getting your</v>

99
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:49.600
<v Speaker 3>feet and was like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a ringworm type thing.</v>

100
00:04:49.601 --> 00:04:53.240
<v Speaker 3>Now hookworm gets in your interest or </v>
<v Speaker 3>your feet because kids would that people</v>

101
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.280
<v Speaker 3>would always use the bat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't use outhouses,</v>

102
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Speaker 3>they use the great outdoors and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd walk around in your bare feet.</v>

103
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.880
<v Speaker 3>So what hookworm does is it gets into </v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

104
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.793
<v Speaker 3>it guy gets it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes through your feet and then it </v>

105
00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 3>causes you to become anemic because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>latches on.</v>

106
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

107
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:12.250
<v Speaker 3>It had to have some mechanism where it </v>
<v Speaker 3>lapsed on the intestine or something.</v>

108
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.293
<v Speaker 3>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huge portions of the south after the </v>

109
00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 3>civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after the civil war were anemic.</v>

110
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.963
<v Speaker 3>I mean huge towns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact it was so bad that they </v>

111
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:23.580
<v Speaker 3>started renting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>running campaigns,</v>

112
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.423
<v Speaker 3>saying bought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Use An outhouse or die was an outhouse </v>

113
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:28.684
<v Speaker 3>or die and they solved the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was a major issue in </v>

114
00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:34.780
<v Speaker 3>reconstruction after the war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Major issue in this country in the south</v>

115
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 3>when I lived in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people used to always talk about worms.</v>

116
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.510
<v Speaker 3>Now that I'm thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this was one of the first times I'm</v>

117
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:43.420
<v Speaker 3>remembering this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of my aunts got it.</v>

118
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 3>I think she used to walk around barefoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Florida is so tropical,</v>

119
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much.</v>

120
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 3>When we lived there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we see alligators all the time.</v>

121
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.200
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

122
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 3>and this was when they were there were </v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

123
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 3>there were protected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever have worms?</v>

124
00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.200
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

125
00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.510
<v Speaker 1>I never got like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten ringworm before though.</v>

126
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>

127
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.113
<v Speaker 1>But this guy right here that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at it as the worms come out of </v>

128
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 1>his ass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>told me this.</v>

129
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.290
<v Speaker 1>One of my most vivid memories was my </v>
<v Speaker 1>sister screaming and crying and I run in</v>

130
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:12.914
<v Speaker 1>and there's a giant pink warm coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>right out of her four year old ass or </v>

131
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:16.784
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She didn't know what the fuck was </v>

132
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

133
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

134
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a worm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have told mom I was a six,</v>

135
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.343
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about worms coming out of your </v>

136
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:28.160
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a kid.</v>

137
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:28.994
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd had him and I was looking to snakes </v>

138
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:31.191
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

139
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:32.470
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mother made it like,</v>

140
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 1>look at you now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take this medicine.</v>

141
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.013
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens if you don't have those</v>
<v Speaker 1>warrants or if you don't take the </v>

142
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:40.500
<v Speaker 1>medication for those worms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worms,</v>

143
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.270
<v Speaker 1>parasite.</v>

144
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how bad can they fuck you up badly.</v>

145
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.620
<v Speaker 1>Look what tapeworm and the worms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parasites like worms were a major issue.</v>

146
00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:51.104
<v Speaker 1>And if you remember New Guinea worms </v>
<v Speaker 1>which caused I think elephantiasis to </v>

147
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.200
<v Speaker 1>diocese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

148
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.980
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're awful like New Guinea worms.</v>

149
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Look Up New Guinea worms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>

150
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you want to look up something</v>

151
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:06.554
<v Speaker 1>and look up this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That red band was showing me the other </v>

152
00:07:07.851 --> 00:07:08.684
<v Speaker 1>night at the comedy store about some guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who had an insane amount of worms </v>

153
00:07:11.631 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 1>removed from his gut that you went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctor and the complainant's stomach</v>

154
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:18.050
<v Speaker 1>pain that was originally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a video.</v>

156
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.580
<v Speaker 1>Sanitation is such a huge factor in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot there.</v>

157
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.340
<v Speaker 1>Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare you,</v>

158
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.690
<v Speaker 1>how dare you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm talking about?</v>

159
00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Sanitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cynical.</v>

160
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Just put it on for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that the uh,</v>

161
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.690
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't get pulled.</v>

162
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

163
00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:39.190
<v Speaker 1>We can get a look at it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty five year old bodybuilder.</v>

164
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 1>That thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that it?</v>

165
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:41.204
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's it.</v>

166
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was there a real thing?</v>

167
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:44.980
<v Speaker 1>But they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can be deadly.</v>

168
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally have to read.</v>

169
00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:51.430
<v Speaker 1>It says parasitic worms need a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

170
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.313
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This might be like one of those vegan </v>

171
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:57.680
<v Speaker 1>propaganda videos probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at all these worms though.</v>

172
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Fucking shit coming out of this guy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

173
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is insane.</v>

174
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:02.953
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his gut is just stuffed with these </v>

175
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 1>squirming worms as he's pulling them </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

176
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like Spaghetti looks like moving </v>
<v Speaker 1>spaghetti.</v>

177
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Spaghetti looks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not crazy.</v>

178
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:15.370
<v Speaker 1>That I can say look how much it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

179
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.770
<v Speaker 1>that's discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking literally at a large bowl</v>

180
00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:19.604
<v Speaker 1>of spaghetti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

181
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I would,</v>

182
00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.460
<v Speaker 1>I would be wondering if I could eat that</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>

183
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.580
<v Speaker 1>That was the reality for a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>over time.</v>

184
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Look at all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was all inside that dude's body.</v>

185
00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:31.090
<v Speaker 1>And take a look at tape worms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tapeworms are.</v>

186
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>That might be a tape worm that looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a long tapeworm.</v>

187
00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:34.963
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they need animal protein to stay </v>

188
00:08:37.551 --> 00:08:38.450
<v Speaker 1>alive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

189
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Or could they eat anything to stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive?</v>

190
00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:40.953
<v Speaker 1>Seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

191
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.930
<v Speaker 1>Take it to I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true like a.</v>

192
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.280
<v Speaker 1>let's find out if that's true because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is true.</v>

193
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got bugs and worms,</v>

194
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.520
<v Speaker 1>you got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Period.</v>

195
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:53.354
<v Speaker 1>Right now it's supposed to get worms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because you get sick because you </v>

196
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.880
<v Speaker 1>get worms and the worms have food to eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you eat a certain diet.</v>

197
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you shouldn't eat that </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain diet.</v>

198
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.450
<v Speaker 1>You still have a fucking warm living in.</v>

199
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.030
<v Speaker 1>You've still got a warm and loving it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

200
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.930
<v Speaker 1>You got to kill that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figure out how about those worms,</v>

201
00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 1>that breakout of your skin and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a tapeworm massive tape.</v>

202
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:11.064
<v Speaker 1>Worn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Discovered inside a man who complained </v>

203
00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:12.980
<v Speaker 1>to the stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

204
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.260
<v Speaker 1>That's an even different kind of warm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That other guy had small.</v>

205
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's a gang of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>parasites you can get.</v>

206
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 1>You can get it from raw meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that,</v>

207
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.350
<v Speaker 1>but that is something to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find out if that's true,</v>

208
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:27.351
<v Speaker 1>because if they can only survive in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that's eating a protein diet or a</v>

209
00:09:28.831 --> 00:09:29.664
<v Speaker 1>high animal protein diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true because </v>

210
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.890
<v Speaker 1>people got plenty of worms in southern </v>
<v Speaker 1>India where they were very.</v>

211
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 1>They were vegetarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

212
00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:36.804
<v Speaker 1>that's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worms were a fact of life for any </v>

213
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:41.510
<v Speaker 1>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just parasitic date,</v>

214
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:41.970
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

215
00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can get.</v>

216
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.590
<v Speaker 1>But that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're consuming animal protein,</v>

217
00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 1>it's probably another delivery </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism,</v>

218
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

219
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.670
<v Speaker 1>Food borne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foodborne worms.</v>

220
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.533
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also the fact that you grew </v>

221
00:09:56.761 --> 00:09:57.690
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

222
00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.733
<v Speaker 1>your irrigated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including your vegetables in human shit </v>

223
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.110
<v Speaker 1>and animal shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

224
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.953
<v Speaker 1>as part of the fertilizer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that fertilizer got on a piece of </v>

225
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 1>lettuce or something that was raw or got</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your hands and you ingest it,</v>

226
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:14.190
<v Speaker 1>that's how you get things like hepatitis</v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

227
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.170
<v Speaker 1>that's how you get other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

228
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.340
<v Speaker 1>parasites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

229
00:10:17.341 --> 00:10:21.930
<v Speaker 1>That's the apparently the biggest form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Ecolab poisonings from salads.</v>

230
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.310
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that crazy just like,</v>

231
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:28.180
<v Speaker 1>or was it broccoli or sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a type of Ecolab.</v>

232
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just run off,</v>

233
00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was so ruined.</v>

234
00:10:33.361 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 1>The salt and sea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do you know about the salt and sea?</v>

235
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course we do.</v>

236
00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.490
<v Speaker 1>You mean the one in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

237
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:41.280
<v Speaker 1>in Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

238
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.500
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The salt and seasoned California.</v>

239
00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.223
<v Speaker 1>They were calling it the inland Riviera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>California's inland Riviera in the 19 </v>

240
00:10:50.101 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 1>fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It opened up the Colorado River and they</v>

241
00:10:52.951 --> 00:10:56.160
<v Speaker 1>flooded this valley in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about,</v>

242
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.940
<v Speaker 1>it's outside of Palm Beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how far.</v>

243
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a couple of hours or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure it desert though,</v>

244
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:05.880
<v Speaker 1>but it's in the desert and for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

245
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.721
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

246
00:11:06.721 --> 00:11:08.790
<v Speaker 1>a couple of decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was awesome.</v>

247
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.833
<v Speaker 1>So people partied there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sonny Bono and share how to fucking </v>

248
00:11:13.051 --> 00:11:14.970
<v Speaker 1>house there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would boat,</v>

249
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.120
<v Speaker 1>they would fish and swim and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these like beautiful vacation videos</v>

250
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.413
<v Speaker 1>like visit the beautiful Salton Sea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Californias Inland Riviera greetings </v>

251
00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:28.374
<v Speaker 1>from the Salton Sea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they filled that fucking place up </v>

252
00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:35.430
<v Speaker 1>with water and there was tilapia in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and people would boat and all the,</v>

253
00:11:35.431 --> 00:11:36.264
<v Speaker 1>like the hip people from the 19 fifties </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would go to fucking party at the </v>

254
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Salton Sea.</v>

255
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.980
<v Speaker 1>It was just the spot to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

256
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:44.003
<v Speaker 1>Then the runoff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the runoff from all the pesticides and </v>

257
00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:53.121
<v Speaker 1>all the farmers use all got in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>water and the die off is so the fish die</v>

258
00:11:54.581 --> 00:11:55.414
<v Speaker 1>off that the white sands around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shores in some spots are actually just </v>

259
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.510
<v Speaker 1>dead fish bones like that right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is all that guy is standing on dead</v>

260
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:09.130
<v Speaker 1>fish bones because they're tilapia or </v>
<v Speaker 1>like particularly hardy,</v>

261
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.323
<v Speaker 1>and they were like one of the only fish </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can survive in that fucking </v>

262
00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:14.680
<v Speaker 1>polluted cesspool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now really it's Sonny Bono.</v>

263
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:15.514
<v Speaker 1>Before he died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we went skiing and wacked into a </v>

264
00:12:17.111 --> 00:12:17.944
<v Speaker 1>tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his goal was to find some sort of a </v>

265
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:25.681
<v Speaker 1>desalination and filtration method for </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking all the runoff and all the,</v>

266
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.480
<v Speaker 1>all the pesticides and bullshit out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the salt and sea.</v>

267
00:12:28.481 --> 00:12:29.314
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to try to clean it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like one of his ideas of what </v>

268
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:32.180
<v Speaker 1>does that.</v>

269
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.730
<v Speaker 1>You just showed us that before and </v>
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>

270
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.500
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

271
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

272
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.353
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing story because they just </v>

273
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.040
<v Speaker 1>didn't understand what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>

274
00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:45.190
<v Speaker 1>is it the LLC that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the picture.</v>

275
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

276
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:50.380
<v Speaker 1>That was a real legit see that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

277
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.670
<v Speaker 1>somehow environmentally we know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians or whoever was in that area,</v>

278
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.750
<v Speaker 1>it's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did they do that?</v>

279
00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Dried it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

280
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:00.034
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it had something to do with </v>

281
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:06.220
<v Speaker 1>irrigation and farming I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe I'm wrong.</v>

282
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:08.050
<v Speaker 1>When I was in Seattle a couple months </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

283
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to this gentleman who runs,</v>

284
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:11.303
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this like salmon thing down </v>

285
00:13:12.821 --> 00:13:16.170
<v Speaker 1>there where you can go underneath one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bridges and actually see the ladders</v>

286
00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:17.004
<v Speaker 1>where the salmon pass through and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could see the salmon swimming up the </v>

287
00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:19.180
<v Speaker 1>river.</v>

288
00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:20.770
<v Speaker 1>It's really fucking bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

289
00:13:20.771 --> 00:13:21.604
<v Speaker 1>it's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you go under the river and these </v>

290
00:13:23.531 --> 00:13:25.330
<v Speaker 1>are just wild salmon that are doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>their thing,</v>

291
00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:27.190
<v Speaker 1>but you get to look at them through like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a window.</v>

292
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.473
<v Speaker 1>So they took something that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally anyway and they just gave put </v>

293
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:32.920
<v Speaker 1>a window so you can go under ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check it out.</v>

294
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:34.810
<v Speaker 1>And then they made it like an awareness </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

295
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:36.280
<v Speaker 1>They showed the salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

296
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.980
<v Speaker 1>which sort of accounts the fish as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>go through in some spots.</v>

297
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.363
<v Speaker 1>But this guy was saying that at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time they had carved a channel </v>

298
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.220
<v Speaker 1>into this lake and connected this lake </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the ocean,</v>

299
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.650
<v Speaker 1>and as they were connecting this lake to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ocean,</v>

300
00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:53.600
<v Speaker 1>they fucked up and it drained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

301
00:13:53.601 --> 00:13:54.434
<v Speaker 1>these other waterways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the salmon didn't have a way to </v>

302
00:13:56.831 --> 00:14:00.850
<v Speaker 1>get back into the lake anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they died in mass.</v>

303
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.713
<v Speaker 1>Just millions of salmon just piled up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and took the path they always take and </v>

304
00:14:04.871 --> 00:14:06.040
<v Speaker 1>just died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Rod,</v>

305
00:14:06.041 --> 00:14:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why she just had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>toilet,</v>

306
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.710
<v Speaker 1>this image of when you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about all the salmon that died and,</v>

307
00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:13.510
<v Speaker 1>but they're swimming in one direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

308
00:14:13.511 --> 00:14:16.470
<v Speaker 1>I had this image of all the actors come </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Los Angeles.</v>

309
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:18.923
<v Speaker 1>I would always feel that way sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember driving and traffic to an </v>

310
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:24.580
<v Speaker 1>audition or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

311
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:28.570
<v Speaker 1>and I would always get this image of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a salmon swimming up river.</v>

312
00:14:28.571 --> 00:14:30.130
<v Speaker 1>And more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what the.</v>

313
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.100
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't really sure what I was doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

314
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.690
<v Speaker 1>The guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if I'm doing this,</v>

315
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.583
<v Speaker 1>so I can see if I can win at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Impossible game or do I really want to </v>

316
00:14:38.681 --> 00:14:39.514
<v Speaker 1>be on set acting like what's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on and what is acting anyway and </v>

317
00:14:42.971 --> 00:14:45.370
<v Speaker 1>why did I get into this in the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>place and who am I heroes?</v>

318
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>De Niro and walk in and Chino and.</v>

319
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:48.933
<v Speaker 1>But then I know what they're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and do I just want to be in the </v>

320
00:14:51.561 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 1>movie and</v>

321
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.843
<v Speaker 3>be the guy in the movie or do I really </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be an actor and why am I </v>

322
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:58.580
<v Speaker 3>spending so much time doing Jujitsu and </v>
<v Speaker 3>other things when I should be working on</v>

323
00:14:58.581 --> 00:15:02.600
<v Speaker 3>my acting isn't interesting and if girls</v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't involved with I do it.</v>

324
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.760
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are</v>

325
00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.590
<v Speaker 4>questions to lot to bring a lot to bring</v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

326
00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:07.443
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot to unbox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to kind of get a on something </v>

327
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:11.200
<v Speaker 4>important to say.</v>

330
00:15:14.351 --> 00:15:15.970
<v Speaker 5>It has nothing to do with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>According to him,</v>

331

<v Speaker 5>eating lots of meat.</v>

<v Speaker 4>paranoid.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but what?</v>

348
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.890
<v Speaker 4>What he had to say and what I saw from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that believe in them.</v>

349
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:02.773
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty obvious what's going on and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem with everybody freaking out </v>

350
00:16:05.461 --> 00:16:06.294
<v Speaker 4>about these fucking artificial clouds </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are made naturally by jets as they </v>

351
00:16:08.821 --> 00:16:10.470
<v Speaker 4>passed through the air with the moisture</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the air.</v>

352
00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:11.453
<v Speaker 4>The problem with them freaking out about</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of stuff is the government </v>

353
00:16:13.051 --> 00:16:13.884
<v Speaker 4>does do shady shit sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you got to be able to differentiate </v>

354
00:16:16.471 --> 00:16:17.304
<v Speaker 4>between what it's actually doing shady </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit and when it's just a chemical </v>

355
00:16:19.891 --> 00:16:24.891
<v Speaker 4>reaction or just a natural reaction of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the superheated jet engine hits the cool</v>

356
00:16:24.961 --> 00:16:26.880
<v Speaker 4>air and it creates this cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

357
00:16:26.881 --> 00:16:27.960
<v Speaker 4>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can,</v>

358
00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.340
<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do it right now.</v>

359
00:16:29.341 --> 00:16:31.620
<v Speaker 4>You can go do it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not hurting anybody,</v>

360
00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:32.571
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

361
00:16:32.571 --> 00:16:33.140
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

362
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:37.670
<v Speaker 3>my experience with people who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theorists is not so much that</v>

363
00:16:37.671 --> 00:16:38.504
<v Speaker 3>they're looking for the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a little bit more and I </v>

364
00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:42.230
<v Speaker 3>want to be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's,</v>

365
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.393
<v Speaker 3>I always noticed that they are more </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in belonging to a club that </v>

366
00:16:47.451 --> 00:16:50.300
<v Speaker 3>is in the know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an identity attached to it,</v>

367
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:54.140
<v Speaker 3>so it no longer becomes really about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>search for see if you're,</v>

368
00:16:54.141 --> 00:16:55.700
<v Speaker 3>if you're scientifically minded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

369
00:16:55.701 --> 00:16:56.990
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're somebody who says,</v>

370
00:16:56.991 --> 00:16:58.400
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Michael Shermer says,</v>

371
00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.700
<v Speaker 3>I believe in the scientific method.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What that really means is you start with</v>

372
00:17:01.701 --> 00:17:02.534
<v Speaker 3>doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doubt is always present because you're </v>

373
00:17:04.161 --> 00:17:04.994
<v Speaker 3>always trying to prove what your </v>
<v Speaker 3>assumptions and your assumptions are </v>

374
00:17:08.721 --> 00:17:09.554
<v Speaker 3>usually assumed to be wrong until they </v>
<v Speaker 3>are proven otherwise through trial and </v>

375
00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:15.554
<v Speaker 3>error,</v>
<v Speaker 3>independent lines of inquiry that come </v>

376
00:17:16.881 --> 00:17:20.120
<v Speaker 3>to the same conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All things being equal,</v>

377
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the things that we,</v>

378
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.240
<v Speaker 3>that is how we live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

379
00:17:23.241 --> 00:17:24.270
<v Speaker 3>that's what the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was good.</v>

380
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.810
<v Speaker 3>It goes into the medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the computer that you use and everything</v>

381
00:17:26.811 --> 00:17:27.470
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

382
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:28.303
<v Speaker 3>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a way to get to a result that </v>

383
00:17:31.041 --> 00:17:33.320
<v Speaker 3>actually has tangible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mathematical,</v>

384
00:17:33.321 --> 00:17:35.680
<v Speaker 3>measurable reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

385
00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:36.573
<v Speaker 3>and I think that conspiracy theorists </v>
<v Speaker 3>are as attached to being a conspiracy </v>

386
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.830
<v Speaker 3>theorist regardless of what that means </v>
<v Speaker 3>as they are,</v>

387
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.940
<v Speaker 3>as someone who would be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

388
00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.630
<v Speaker 3>it's an identity as opposed to a certain</v>

389
00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:52.451
<v Speaker 4>for truth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

390
00:17:52.451 --> 00:17:55.500
<v Speaker 4>it's also like a default view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't wait to default.</v>

391
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.090
<v Speaker 4>The default view is that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy.</v>

392
00:17:58.091 --> 00:18:02.140
<v Speaker 4>The problem with that default view is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that sometimes it's a conspiracy,</v>

393
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.660
<v Speaker 4>but if you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot.</v>

394
00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:10.000
<v Speaker 4>And conspiracy theories are wrong a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they jump too quickly.</v>

395
00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:11.103
<v Speaker 4>They jumped to conclusions too quickly </v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of actually looking at what the </v>

396
00:18:13.691 --> 00:18:16.420
<v Speaker 4>fuck the facts are and then going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

397
00:18:16.421 --> 00:18:17.254
<v Speaker 4>well what's fishy about the facts?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All they do is concentrate on what's </v>

398
00:18:19.451 --> 00:18:20.320
<v Speaker 4>fishy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

399
00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.213
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did try to narrow in on the one </v>

400
00:18:23.351 --> 00:18:26.350
<v Speaker 4>thing that they think is the most fishy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember these jet planes when I</v>

401
00:18:26.351 --> 00:18:27.184
<v Speaker 4>was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

402
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:28.083
<v Speaker 4>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't even remember what call your </v>

403
00:18:28.421 --> 00:18:29.620
<v Speaker 4>house was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

404
00:18:29.621 --> 00:18:31.240
<v Speaker 4>You don't remember shit from when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>were a kid.</v>

405
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.790
<v Speaker 4>Of course you don't remember whether or </v>
<v Speaker 4>not there with lines behind jets,</v>

406
00:18:33.791 --> 00:18:34.624
<v Speaker 4>but there's photos that show lines </v>
<v Speaker 4>behind Jack Horse and you show them </v>

407
00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:36.960
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

408
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.170
<v Speaker 4>They get those photos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

409
00:18:38.171 --> 00:18:39.004
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>come on,</v>

410
00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.083
<v Speaker 4>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know there's a lot of shady shit the </v>

411
00:18:41.711 --> 00:18:44.830
<v Speaker 4>government has done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this one has been tied up.</v>

412
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.500
<v Speaker 4>It's obvious with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the problem.</v>

413
00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:48.933
<v Speaker 4>When you pretend that those are clouds </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that these clouds that are coming </v>

414
00:18:52.001 --> 00:18:52.834
<v Speaker 4>out of the back of these jets are some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a chemical spray that the </v>

415
00:18:55.601 --> 00:19:00.310
<v Speaker 4>government is launching indiscriminately</v>
<v Speaker 4>down on on civilization for mind control</v>

416
00:19:00.311 --> 00:19:01.144
<v Speaker 4>or some nefarious purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So whatever fucking nefarious purpose </v>

417
00:19:03.581 --> 00:19:07.570
<v Speaker 4>that believe it's the worst,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the most obvious government program</v>

418
00:19:07.571 --> 00:19:11.950
<v Speaker 4>ever because it's so ineffective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jack Shit like they.</v>

419
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.530
<v Speaker 4>It hasn't done anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are living longer than ever.</v>

420
00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:15.693
<v Speaker 4>Diseases are getting cured,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether there they're more rebellious </v>

421
00:19:17.201 --> 00:19:18.034
<v Speaker 4>than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone was for Bill Murray shirt on </v>

422
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.423
<v Speaker 4>and people would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If Bill Murray was running for fucking </v>

423
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:24.730
<v Speaker 4>president right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people will vote.</v>

424
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.810
<v Speaker 4>They would vote for him.</v>

425
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.673
<v Speaker 3>Really awesome about the Internet and </v>
<v Speaker 3>about all of this is that I think like </v>

426
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.843
<v Speaker 3>all you hear lately and I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the mainstream media is not </v>

427
00:19:35.661 --> 00:19:37.670
<v Speaker 3>really a reliable source of truth </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

428
00:19:37.671 --> 00:19:39.410
<v Speaker 3>They're not objective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just not objective.</v>

429
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.920
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

430
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like trump,</v>

431
00:19:41.271 --> 00:19:44.660
<v Speaker 3>but I will admit that the New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>liberal media,</v>

432
00:19:44.661 --> 00:19:47.240
<v Speaker 3>who I rarely agree with anyway has been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has given him.</v>

433
00:19:47.241 --> 00:19:49.950
<v Speaker 3>I'll fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's not as.</v>

434
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.023
<v Speaker 3>He's his own worst enemy of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no question that a lot of </v>

435
00:19:53.691 --> 00:19:58.691
<v Speaker 3>it's either bought off or it's or it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>or influenced by by its owners because.</v>

436
00:20:00.171 --> 00:20:02.450
<v Speaker 3>And influenced by the fact that it has </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be entertaining.</v>

437
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.720
<v Speaker 3>It can be for ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also not objective.</v>

438
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:07.663
<v Speaker 3>When I was watching Hannity on Fox News,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he wouldn't even let this woman get her </v>

439
00:20:12.081 --> 00:20:14.780
<v Speaker 3>point of view out about Hillary and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't.</v>

440
00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.240
<v Speaker 3>He just kept interrupting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you know,</v>

441
00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.490
<v Speaker 3>it's not about a discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about pushing an agenda.</v>

442
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:20.383
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think what's what's to happen and </v>

443
00:20:21.711 --> 00:20:22.544
<v Speaker 3>what has happened is you have things </v>
<v Speaker 3>like viceland and different independent </v>

444
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.840
<v Speaker 3>movements that are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

445
00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:34.900
<v Speaker 3>let's get integrity back into journalism</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's very needed and let's,</v>

446
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.680
<v Speaker 3>let's get out there and get real stories</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are going to take guts and let's do</v>

447
00:20:39.681 --> 00:20:40.514
<v Speaker 3>some real investigative journaling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they'll always be a marketplace </v>

448
00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:44.900
<v Speaker 3>for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to know the truth.</v>

449
00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.040
<v Speaker 3>We want the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to have a full.</v>

450
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.850
<v Speaker 3>I know that Fox News</v>

451
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.810
<v Speaker 1>and CNN are give a lot of news to a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people,</v>

452
00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:53.644
<v Speaker 1>but I think as they continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discredit themselves with certain </v>

453
00:20:57.101 --> 00:20:57.934
<v Speaker 1>behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to be looking for more </v>

454
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:00.311
<v Speaker 1>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

455
00:21:00.311 --> 00:21:01.144
<v Speaker 1>they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't fall back on that anymore </v>

456
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:06.490
<v Speaker 1>because they're the purveyors of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are the only ones here,</v>

457
00:21:06.491 --> 00:21:09.400
<v Speaker 1>the only world purveyors of truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CNN,</v>

458
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Fox News,</v>
<v Speaker 1>NBC,</v>

459
00:21:10.931 --> 00:21:12.130
<v Speaker 1>ABC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CBS,</v>

460
00:21:12.131 --> 00:21:12.964
<v Speaker 1>the big ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody that's putting out these </v>

461
00:21:14.831 --> 00:21:17.380
<v Speaker 1>gigantic shows that are being viewed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people.</v>

462
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.290
<v Speaker 1>There's a small handful of you and if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're full of shit,</v>

463
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:22.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a giant problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you're full of shit,</v>

464
00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:24.460
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the good stuff that you do,</v>

465
00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.650
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking us.</v>

466
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:27.783
<v Speaker 1>And I watched Fox News,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watch CNN the other day and I'm going </v>

467
00:21:30.341 --> 00:21:31.174
<v Speaker 1>back and forth between the two of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would just watch one for now and </v>

468
00:21:32.951 --> 00:21:34.150
<v Speaker 1>then watch what the other for now.</v>

469
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.470
<v Speaker 1>One of them just wants to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but sexual assault and they were</v>

470
00:21:38.471 --> 00:21:41.290
<v Speaker 1>talking about how important it is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>

471
00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:42.143
<v Speaker 1>We don't use certain language in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>workplace and Don Lemon was telling </v>

472
00:21:45.161 --> 00:21:45.994
<v Speaker 1>people's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had Czech people have my personal </v>

473
00:21:48.161 --> 00:21:50.440
<v Speaker 1>life and that amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just talking about gender,</v>

474
00:21:50.441 --> 00:21:52.510
<v Speaker 1>it's about sexual assault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look,</v>

475
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.940
<v Speaker 1>the sexual assault allegations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

476
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:56.200
<v Speaker 1>they're all serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

477
00:21:56.201 --> 00:21:57.034
<v Speaker 1>You don't want a guy who's a sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>assault attacker who is in the White </v>

478
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:01.751
<v Speaker 1>House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want that,</v>

479
00:22:01.751 --> 00:22:02.590
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

480
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:03.843
<v Speaker 1>But it's also important that you look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the fucking corruption that's been </v>

481
00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:12.340
<v Speaker 1>shown about the Democratic Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they did to keep Bernie sanders</v>

482
00:22:12.341 --> 00:22:14.980
<v Speaker 1>out the way they conspired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

483
00:22:14.981 --> 00:22:17.740
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton and the Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 1>Foundation,</v>

484
00:22:17.741 --> 00:22:18.574
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's the list of grievances </v>
<v Speaker 1>and corruption has been well documented </v>

485
00:22:22.781 --> 00:22:23.614
<v Speaker 1>as a mile long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like if I was Hillary </v>

486
00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Clinton and I knew that I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of dirt on me.</v>

487
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:29.403
<v Speaker 1>Like God damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did some shady shit and now the </v>

488
00:22:30.611 --> 00:22:35.611
<v Speaker 1>internet starting to expose my financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealings and these $250,000</v>

489
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.680
<v Speaker 1>speeches that she get to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

490
00:22:38.681 --> 00:22:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I would wait to run against someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so fucking terrible.</v>

491
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:47.550
<v Speaker 1>Someone's a horrible person and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe I could get donald to like do</v>

492
00:22:47.801 --> 00:22:49.420
<v Speaker 1>me a solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Donald's like,</v>

493
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:50.410
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll play it up.</v>

494

<v Speaker 1>Big Pussy grab and I'll say a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

495
00:22:53.501 --> 00:22:58.270
<v Speaker 1>She will leak some tapes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that far fetched almost.</v>

496
00:22:58.271 --> 00:22:59.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about a conspiracy.</v>

497
00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.400
<v Speaker 1>It was a Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that right?</v>

498
00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's.</v>

499
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:04.533
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Donald trump was anything </v>

500
00:23:05.411 --> 00:23:06.760
<v Speaker 1>but Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ian,</v>

501
00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:07.653
<v Speaker 1>I mean I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that Donald Trump has an </v>

502
00:23:10.031 --> 00:23:12.820
<v Speaker 1>ideology or philosophy because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would require.</v>

503
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>

504
00:23:14.051 --> 00:23:14.884
<v Speaker 1>He has an ideology and philosophy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of what he can see in what he has </v>

505
00:23:18.791 --> 00:23:21.980
<v Speaker 1>experienced and felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you're,</v>

506
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:22.863
<v Speaker 1>if you think Donald Trump actually has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and an ideology that was </v>

507
00:23:26.231 --> 00:23:27.064
<v Speaker 1>based on him sort of really thinking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading and take and stepping outside </v>

508
00:23:30.581 --> 00:23:31.930
<v Speaker 1>himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaching beyond himself,</v>

509
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.360
<v Speaker 1>you're out of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my problem with Donald Trump.</v>

510
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:37.180
<v Speaker 1>That's my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to Morgan Murphys,</v>

511
00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:41.080
<v Speaker 1>instagram page and pulled pork and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Murphy put this thing up today.</v>

512
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:41.973
<v Speaker 1>She's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She put this thing up today about a </v>

513
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump debating a scientist.</v>

514
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.330
<v Speaker 1>Put this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

515
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:54.500
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

516
00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.980
<v Speaker 1>He's just such a character like there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>never been a character like this running</v>

517
00:23:57.981 --> 00:24:00.140
<v Speaker 1>for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so torn like,</v>

518
00:24:00.141 --> 00:24:02.420
<v Speaker 1>watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go fullscreen and press press place that</v>

519
00:24:02.421 --> 00:24:03.254
<v Speaker 1>we get here.</v>

520
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.433
<v Speaker 6>Philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Maxwell's equations together in the </v>

521
00:24:12.411 --> 00:24:13.244
<v Speaker 6>right way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll get the velocity of waves moving </v>

522
00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:16.840
<v Speaker 6>down in actual.</v>

523
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:21.343
<v Speaker 1>That's actually genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's he'll look at his facial </v>

524
00:24:23.581 --> 00:24:24.750
<v Speaker 1>expressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

525
00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.613
<v Speaker 1>this is why I've started feeling like </v>
<v Speaker 1>life is fiction because his facial </v>

526
00:24:29.761 --> 00:24:33.940
<v Speaker 1>expressions are literally what you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>see in a Dr Seuss book.</v>

527
00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

528
00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:37.590
<v Speaker 1>he pulls his Chin in tight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

529
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually find him.</v>

530
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.750
<v Speaker 1>I see all of that stuff that people talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

531
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.033
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to me is so a of minimal </v>

532
00:24:48.781 --> 00:24:49.830
<v Speaker 1>importance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not,</v>

533
00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:50.873
<v Speaker 1>there's so much of what he does is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually entertaining and stuff like </v>

534
00:24:52.381 --> 00:24:53.080
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talks,</v>

535
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.570
<v Speaker 1>he teases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's insulting.</v>

536
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.550
<v Speaker 1>If the guy was really up on issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the guy,</v>

537
00:24:59.551 --> 00:25:00.990
<v Speaker 1>if there was every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any evidence,</v>

538
00:25:00.991 --> 00:25:03.180
<v Speaker 1>he took advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just taking advice.</v>

539
00:25:03.181 --> 00:25:04.014
<v Speaker 1>He can't take advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't even prepare for the debates </v>

540
00:25:06.241 --> 00:25:07.590
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see it.</v>

541
00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:11.490
<v Speaker 1>He's just so off the cuff and I'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest with you,</v>

542
00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I'll be honest.</v>

543
00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:13.883
<v Speaker 1>I'll be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's cheating going on and </v>

544
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:20.490
<v Speaker 1>she's broken and I'll collaborate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Posey,</v>

545
00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.593
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone needs to explain to him economy </v>

546
00:25:22.981 --> 00:25:24.930
<v Speaker 1>of words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super important,</v>

547
00:25:24.931 --> 00:25:25.764
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't know because he could get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a position of like being a leader </v>

548
00:25:28.201 --> 00:25:30.180
<v Speaker 1>like she like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's really good at that.</v>

549
00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Her economy of words is excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how her brain is organized.</v>

550
00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:38.900
<v Speaker 1>His brain is not organized that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His brain is organized to be impulsive,</v>

551
00:25:39.481 --> 00:25:42.660
<v Speaker 1>to be reactive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you to draw a picture of his brain,</v>

552
00:25:42.661 --> 00:25:44.650
<v Speaker 1>like a side view of his brain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

553
00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.013
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what percentage of it would just say </v>

554
00:25:47.071 --> 00:25:51.540
<v Speaker 1>grab the pussy inside if you had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>break it up like wisdom health.</v>

555
00:25:51.541 --> 00:25:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he's thinking about.</v>

556
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:57.420
<v Speaker 1>I think that the grab the pussy would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>much smaller than the part of the.</v>

557
00:25:57.421 --> 00:26:00.240
<v Speaker 1>Brandon just said me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

558
00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:01.410
<v Speaker 1>that's my aunt.</v>

559
00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:05.460
<v Speaker 1>She was a Democrat from 2001 to 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2008.</v>

560
00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:09.930
<v Speaker 1>He gave to John Mccain for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave to Hillary Clinton's campaign,</v>

561
00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.600
<v Speaker 1>but then he was also as a real estate </v>
<v Speaker 1>developer.</v>

562
00:26:12.601 --> 00:26:13.434
<v Speaker 1>He was very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was.</v>

563
00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:14.453
<v Speaker 1>He gave to whatever political party was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get him the tax breaks he </v>

564
00:26:17.431 --> 00:26:19.530
<v Speaker 1>needed or give them the favors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needed that.</v>

565
00:26:19.531 --> 00:26:20.364
<v Speaker 1>That's really what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was secretly hoping that he was doing </v>

566
00:26:23.491 --> 00:26:27.810
<v Speaker 1>all this asshole stuff running to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republican nomination.</v>

567
00:26:27.811 --> 00:26:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Then once you've got the Republican </v>
<v Speaker 1>nomination,</v>

568
00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:32.040
<v Speaker 1>he would just completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Quito,</v>

569
00:26:32.041 --> 00:26:35.340
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing and Intel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:26:35.341 --> 00:26:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

571
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:36.803
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be as reasonable and </v>

572
00:26:38.161 --> 00:26:38.994
<v Speaker 1>rational as possible and I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>insult you and I don't want to pretend </v>

573
00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 1>that things are any worse</v>

574
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.053
<v Speaker 3>than they really are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I believe that you're part of a </v>

575
00:26:46.261 --> 00:26:47.094
<v Speaker 3>systemically corrupt system and I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 3>to just get to this position so that I </v>

576
00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.760
<v Speaker 3>once now I'm here now I can just tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>you how I really feel,</v>

577
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.540
<v Speaker 3>but I feel like the system is broken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is and it's crazy.</v>

578
00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:58.403
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy that we stick to it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we could definitely come up with a </v>

579
00:27:00.181 --> 00:27:02.400
<v Speaker 3>better one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we stick to it because it's old.</v>

580
00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:05.180
<v Speaker 3>Well also though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

581
00:27:05.181 --> 00:27:06.240
<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't begrudge,</v>

582
00:27:06.241 --> 00:27:09.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't like when people insult trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>voters and I'll tell you why.</v>

583
00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:09.893
<v Speaker 3>I think there are a lot of trump voters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might be ignorant or not interested </v>

584
00:27:11.641 --> 00:27:12.420
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

585
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.040
<v Speaker 3>but I always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's unfair.</v>

586
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:15.203
<v Speaker 3>I think it's unfair to categorize </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody who wants to vote for trump or </v>

587
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:18.533
<v Speaker 3>not vote for hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's very unfair and </v>

588
00:27:20.461 --> 00:27:24.450
<v Speaker 3>condescending to consider them to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>DM or a rednecks.</v>

589
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:25.463
<v Speaker 3>I think the problem with that is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hilary Clinton is talking in very much </v>

590
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:29.694
<v Speaker 3>the same way and along the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>parallels that Obama did eight years </v>

591
00:27:33.721 --> 00:27:37.260
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you are a working class dude,</v>

592
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:38.573
<v Speaker 3>if you are somebody who has been left </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind through globalization and </v>

593
00:27:43.831 --> 00:27:44.664
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess just how the country is moving </v>

594
00:27:46.681 --> 00:27:48.390
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you're a coal miner,</v>

595
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.070
<v Speaker 3>if you're A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

596
00:27:50.071 --> 00:27:50.904
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of industries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are listening to this woman speak </v>

597
00:27:55.261 --> 00:27:58.120
<v Speaker 3>exactly the way Obama did eight years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago and your life has gotten worse.</v>

598
00:27:58.121 --> 00:27:59.280
<v Speaker 3>It hasn't gotten better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gotten worse.</v>

599
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:00.563
<v Speaker 3>Why in the world would you not?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why in the world would out of </v>

600
00:28:03.211 --> 00:28:07.770
<v Speaker 3>desperation would you not try this very </v>
<v Speaker 3>entertaining,</v>

601
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.440
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>giant white guy who's,</v>

602
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.333
<v Speaker 3>who's got confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who wants to break Washington apart and </v>

603
00:28:15.601 --> 00:28:17.370
<v Speaker 3>who saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to make Washington.</v>

604
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean America Great.</v>

605
00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:21.780
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it that that appeals to our emotions and</v>

606
00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:22.710
<v Speaker 3>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

607
00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:23.544
<v Speaker 3>I do a lot of reading and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I would necessarily be </v>

608
00:28:25.891 --> 00:28:26.724
<v Speaker 3>that different if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't know what else you take </v>

609
00:28:28.951 --> 00:28:30.840
<v Speaker 3>acting and stand up away from me or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

610
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.400
<v Speaker 3>What am I going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Teach.</v>

611
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either way.</v>

612
00:28:33.901 --> 00:28:36.300
<v Speaker 3>I would be pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be pretty desperate for a change and</v>

613
00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:37.134
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be voting for Hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but don't you think there's a giant </v>

614
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.473
<v Speaker 3>issue in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in deciding that you're going to vote </v>

615
00:28:42.211 --> 00:28:47.160
<v Speaker 3>for someone who says they're going to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>after someone and lock them in jail.</v>

616
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:48.023
<v Speaker 3>That's what a dictator done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A set set of special prosecutor on her </v>

617
00:28:51.751 --> 00:28:53.460
<v Speaker 3>and how?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if I was president,</v>

618
00:28:53.461 --> 00:28:55.740
<v Speaker 3>you'd be in jail like she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>

619
00:28:55.741 --> 00:28:58.750
<v Speaker 3>but that's how it dictating him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How a dictator dictator.</v>

620
00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.110
<v Speaker 3>What do they always do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When dictators coming to power,</v>

621
00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:03.450
<v Speaker 3>their opposition gets locked up or </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>

622
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.313
<v Speaker 3>You can correct me if I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the president doesn't have the </v>

623
00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:10.440
<v Speaker 3>power to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have the power to start some special</v>

624
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:12.330
<v Speaker 3>investigation on her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The answer,</v>

625
00:29:12.331 --> 00:29:13.164
<v Speaker 3>the short answer is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The president can appoint an attorney </v>

626
00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:17.760
<v Speaker 3>general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

627
00:29:17.761 --> 00:29:18.594
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the Justice Department is on </v>

628
00:29:19.481 --> 00:29:20.550
<v Speaker 3>attorney general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>

629
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:22.540
<v Speaker 3>to investigate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

630
00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:23.670
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

631
00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.080
<v Speaker 3>special case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

632
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.000
<v Speaker 3>He could technically do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

633
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.870
<v Speaker 3>That's not seem fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>

634
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.620
<v Speaker 3>She could do that to him too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

635
00:29:31.621 --> 00:29:32.050
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

636
00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:34.790
<v Speaker 3>it's much deeper than that because </v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump will say things like this.</v>

637
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.720
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

638
00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.950
<v Speaker 3>if I told the generals what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would do it.</v>

639
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:40.200
<v Speaker 3>And I've always said we go in and take </v>
<v Speaker 3>the oyster.</v>

640
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.093
<v Speaker 3>You're paraphrasing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not phrasing that he actually said </v>

641
00:29:42.521 --> 00:29:42.911
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

642
00:29:42.911 --> 00:29:44.380
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I told them what to do,</v>

643
00:29:44.381 --> 00:29:44.760
<v Speaker 3>they do it.</v>

644
00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.350
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

645
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:48.310
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know how to run the military.</v>

646
00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:52.480
<v Speaker 3>Unlike these people he's had and our </v>
<v Speaker 3>general failed five deferments.</v>

647
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:53.343
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what I'm saying is that as a </v>

648
00:29:54.971 --> 00:29:57.130
<v Speaker 3>dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he was in charge,</v>

649
00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.760
<v Speaker 3>he didn't even know how that works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he really said that is what my point</v>

650
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:01.600
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

651
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:05.320
<v Speaker 3>He said many things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's such a,</v>

652
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:10.880
<v Speaker 3>he's such an obvious Megalomania may </v>
<v Speaker 3>megalomaniac such an obvious demagogue.</v>

653
00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:13.270
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't,</v>

654
00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:15.070
<v Speaker 3>and you're talking to a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like Hillary at all.</v>

655
00:30:15.071 --> 00:30:17.320
<v Speaker 3>I think she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she's more of the same.</v>

656
00:30:17.321 --> 00:30:19.210
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think she's a corrupt human being.</v>

657
00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:22.090
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of examples of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

658
00:30:22.091 --> 00:30:24.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm not as uncharitable to say that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think she's,</v>

659
00:30:24.611 --> 00:30:27.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't think she's evil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she has a vision for the world.</v>

660
00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:28.570
<v Speaker 3>I think she wished she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in her mind,</v>

661
00:30:28.571 --> 00:30:30.970
<v Speaker 3>she believes she knows what's best for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the country,</v>

662
00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:32.193
<v Speaker 3>but there's a difference because I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's willing to take big shortcuts to </v>

663
00:30:34.661 --> 00:30:36.370
<v Speaker 3>gain influence and always has in her </v>
<v Speaker 3>career.</v>

664
00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:38.650
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like what,</v>

665
00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.390
<v Speaker 3>like what kind of big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>using influence,</v>

666
00:30:40.391 --> 00:30:43.180
<v Speaker 3>using political influence to get what </v>
<v Speaker 3>she wants when,</v>

667
00:30:43.181 --> 00:30:43.901
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

668
00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:47.080
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the people that Clinton </v>
<v Speaker 3>pardoned,</v>

669
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.273
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that part of scandal was the craziest </v>

670
00:30:49.721 --> 00:30:51.460
<v Speaker 3>thing in the world would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pardon Frank?</v>

671
00:30:51.461 --> 00:30:52.990
<v Speaker 3>Rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take a look at the list.</v>

672
00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.160
<v Speaker 3>Frank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rich,</v>

673
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:54.993
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

674
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:55.710
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

675
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:56.543
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary wanted to run for Senate in New </v>

676
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:03.340
<v Speaker 3>York and he needed certain counties and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he needed a large,</v>

677
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.900
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hasidic Jewish vote and he pardoned some</v>

678
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.720
<v Speaker 3>guy in a rabbi or somebody in there that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was such a blur.</v>

679
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:13.780
<v Speaker 3>It literally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember the democratic,</v>

680
00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:16.420
<v Speaker 3>someone I think maybe was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>democratic pundents who said,</v>

681
00:31:17.110 --> 00:31:21.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you defend this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just so obvious that he's trying to</v>

682
00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:23.980
<v Speaker 3>buy his wife votes that he's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>buy influence.</v>

683
00:31:23.981 --> 00:31:26.020
<v Speaker 3>And that was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's well documented.</v>

684
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't think a lot of Democrats would </v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree with that.</v>

685
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look it up.</v>

686
00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.950
<v Speaker 3>Look up the uranium one deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just what they did.</v>

687
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.600
<v Speaker 3>One deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who through Bill Clinton's influence,</v>

688
00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.630
<v Speaker 3>this Canadian businessman bought the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cars like oil,</v>

689
00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.530
<v Speaker 3>a uranium fields.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

690
00:31:39.531 --> 00:31:41.920
<v Speaker 3>let's go one scandal at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first one,</v>

691
00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.650
<v Speaker 3>did you find the first one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

692
00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.340
<v Speaker 3>The guy's name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark richens Scott up before.</v>

693
00:31:48.341 --> 00:31:50.640
<v Speaker 3>I think he was going to go down as like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the at the time,</v>

694
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.360
<v Speaker 3>largest tax evasion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

695
00:31:52.361 --> 00:31:54.170
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Time living in Switzerland.</v>

696
00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.090
<v Speaker 3>He was prosecuting things right here in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the middle.</v>

697
00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>

698
00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:01.453
<v Speaker 3>Future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a fugitive who fled to us during </v>

699
00:32:04.361 --> 00:32:06.250
<v Speaker 3>his prosecution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was residing in Switzerland.</v>

700
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:10.420
<v Speaker 3>He had $48,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>in taxes and was charged with 51 cases.</v>

701
00:32:10.450 --> 00:32:13.420
<v Speaker 3>Accounts of tax was pardoned for tax </v>
<v Speaker 3>evasion.</v>

702
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:15.033
<v Speaker 3>He was required to pay a $1,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine and waive any use of the pardon as </v>

703
00:32:18.761 --> 00:32:19.594
<v Speaker 3>a defense against any future civil </v>
<v Speaker 3>charges that were filed against him in </v>

704
00:32:21.871 --> 00:32:22.900
<v Speaker 3>the same case.</v>

705
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:23.883
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Critics complained that Denise </v>

706
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:26.650
<v Speaker 3>Eisenberg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rich,</v>

707
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:27.483
<v Speaker 3>his former wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had made substantial donations to the </v>

708
00:32:30.311 --> 00:32:34.780
<v Speaker 3>Clinton library and Mrs Clinton's Senate</v>
<v Speaker 3>campaign.</v>

709
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:35.823
<v Speaker 3>What a surprise that Marc Rich,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who lives in Switzerland and you're </v>

710
00:32:39.261 --> 00:32:40.970
<v Speaker 3>going to give him a pardon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they're connected?</v>

711
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 3>It was so blatant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was ridiculous,</v>

712
00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.370
<v Speaker 3>but you can keep going with the pardons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are a lot of examples of that.</v>

713
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.200
<v Speaker 3>So to call Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not corrupt the uranium one deal.</v>

714
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.160
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look that up.</v>

715
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's uranium?</v>

716
00:32:53.241 --> 00:32:54.021
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

717
00:32:54.021 --> 00:32:54.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

718
00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canadian businessman bought the Kazak in</v>

719
00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to be a part of the Soviet Union,</v>

720
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.910
<v Speaker 3>a uranium fields.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

721
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.900
<v Speaker 3>some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some huge uranium fields,</v>

722
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.520
<v Speaker 3>I think some of the biggest in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

723
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:10.790
<v Speaker 3>uranium which you use to make nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons,</v>

724
00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:11.653
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Bill Clinton helped him with his </v>

725
00:33:14.721 --> 00:33:16.760
<v Speaker 3>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a well documented influence,</v>

726
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.660
<v Speaker 3>help this Canadian businessman by those </v>
<v Speaker 3>uranium fields.</v>

727
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:21.523
<v Speaker 3>But here's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Canadian businessman gave </v>

728
00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:24.434
<v Speaker 3>$31,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the Clinton Foundation with a pledge </v>

729
00:33:26.661 --> 00:33:31.640
<v Speaker 3>for 100 million more and he gave Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 3>a $500,000</v>

730
00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:37.930
<v Speaker 3>check for speaking for a speech and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>$500,000.</v>

731
00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.140
<v Speaker 3>Then when it came time for the Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

732
00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:42.993
<v Speaker 3>for the cars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like oil fields to be sold to a Russian </v>

733
00:33:46.161 --> 00:33:46.994
<v Speaker 3>company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Russian company that the State </v>

734
00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.620
<v Speaker 3>Department and everybody else in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence,</v>

735
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:52.670
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our guys,</v>

736
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.740
<v Speaker 3>the Soviets are going to have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>access to uranium,</v>

737
00:33:54.741 --> 00:33:57.110
<v Speaker 3>some of the biggest reserves in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

738
00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.840
<v Speaker 3>And this Canadian business has been sell</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a Russian company.</v>

739
00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:01.013
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary Clinton was secretary of state </v>

740
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.180
<v Speaker 3>at the time and she okayed that deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was one of the people that had,</v>

741
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.250
<v Speaker 3>that had to give her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

742
00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.230
<v Speaker 3>So now the Russians own a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although those oil fields.</v>

743
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:13.093
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and by the way,</v>

744
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:14.383
<v Speaker 3>look up the Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the US Russian technology initiative </v>

745
00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:18.950
<v Speaker 3>where we're.</v>

746
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:19.783
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the movements is to have Russian </v>

747
00:34:22.101 --> 00:34:24.650
<v Speaker 3>citizens in Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm American citizens,</v>

748
00:34:24.651 --> 00:34:25.484
<v Speaker 3>share technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>share technology and technological sort </v>

749
00:34:27.831 --> 00:34:29.660
<v Speaker 3>of ideas and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

750
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:32.690
<v Speaker 3>the problem with that is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that requires American investors.</v>

751
00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.990
<v Speaker 3>Twenty eight of them were chosen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were chosen.</v>

752
00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.820
<v Speaker 3>Sixty percent were 60.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

753
00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:40.713
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Hillary Clinton as secretary of </v>

754
00:34:41.391 --> 00:34:43.010
<v Speaker 3>state was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was spearheading that.</v>

755
00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:48.610
<v Speaker 3>Of the 28 us partners that invested 60 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent gave to the Clinton Foundation.</v>

756
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.100
<v Speaker 3>Now come on now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>

757
00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.060
<v Speaker 3>This is blatant stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we have to look at that.</v>

758
00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.700
<v Speaker 3>You can't quit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great picture.</v>

759
00:34:58.701 --> 00:35:01.850
<v Speaker 3>They got over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could she look more guilty?</v>

760
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:02.893
<v Speaker 3>The report Russian government initiative</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave millions of dollars to Clinton </v>

761
00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:07.663
<v Speaker 3>Foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what does that on while Clinton was </v>

762
00:35:08.361 --> 00:35:11.090
<v Speaker 3>serving as secretary of state?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think she knew that?</v>

763
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.190
<v Speaker 3>What's the website?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's one freebie.</v>

764
00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.940
<v Speaker 3>Kay was in the Wall Street Journal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's been well documented.</v>

765
00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.640
<v Speaker 3>This is not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not a conspiracy stuff.</v>

766
00:35:19.641 --> 00:35:20.474
<v Speaker 3>This is every major publication in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world would knows this and concur is </v>

767
00:35:25.311 --> 00:35:26.930
<v Speaker 3>along the same lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same story.</v>

768
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:28.010
<v Speaker 3>It's the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could,</v>

769
00:35:28.011 --> 00:35:28.844
<v Speaker 3>they could print the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just what do they do with the </v>

770
00:35:30.981 --> 00:35:31.814
<v Speaker 3>money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is the challenge here is the </v>

771
00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:36.740
<v Speaker 3>money because here's the question that </v>
<v Speaker 3>she just recently got some crazy award.</v>

772
00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.073
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the</v>

773
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:38.963
<v Speaker 1>charity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Clinton Foundation received some </v>

774
00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:43.440
<v Speaker 1>highest accreditation or it's a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>good car.</v>

775
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

776
00:35:45.361 --> 00:35:48.480
<v Speaker 1>be careful of those explanations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Foundations have always been notoriously</v>

777
00:35:48.481 --> 00:35:52.380
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and in every aspect including </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting high ratings,</v>

778
00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:53.243
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is no doubt that the Clinton </v>

779
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.983
<v Speaker 1>Foundation does a lot of good for </v>
<v Speaker 1>children with AIDS overseas for I think </v>

780
00:36:02.191 --> 00:36:04.140
<v Speaker 1>things like malaria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>malaria nets,</v>

781
00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:05.323
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they even work maybe with the </v>

782
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:09.270
<v Speaker 1>gates foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do a lot of good stuff now.</v>

783
00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.420
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of reporters have </v>
<v Speaker 1>written about how it's a slush fund,</v>

784
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.403
<v Speaker 1>how it's used for other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about that and I </v>

785
00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:17.574
<v Speaker 1>don't begrudge explained slush fund.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would that mean they would take the </v>

786
00:36:21.241 --> 00:36:24.190
<v Speaker 1>money from there and use it for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own updates?</v>

787
00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Flush look up slush fund.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can give you.</v>

788
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.210
<v Speaker 1>I can give you a definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part it's.</v>

789
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.043
<v Speaker 1>I'm a slush fund typically would be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place to put money that under the under </v>

790
00:36:35.491 --> 00:36:39.090
<v Speaker 1>certain offices has said for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually used for other things.</v>

791
00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.360
<v Speaker 1>A reserve of money used for illicit </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>

792
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Especially political bribery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

793
00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.980
<v Speaker 1>but you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you say is,</v>

794
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this money is for,</v>

795
00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:52.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curing this disease.</v>

796
00:36:52.291 --> 00:36:53.124
<v Speaker 1>But it's used for other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I asked him that might be unfair to </v>

797
00:36:55.741 --> 00:36:57.480
<v Speaker 1>say that the Clinton Foundation's is </v>
<v Speaker 1>less fun.</v>

798
00:36:57.481 --> 00:36:58.314
<v Speaker 1>That's what journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially from conservative newspapers </v>

799
00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:03.120
<v Speaker 1>like Wall Street Journal will say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

800
00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they're going to do that.</v>

801
00:37:04.711 --> 00:37:05.544
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I was going to say earlier about </v>

802
00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.180
<v Speaker 1>Tony back and forth between CNN and Fox </v>
<v Speaker 1>News,</v>

803
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.420
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the best examples I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever seen of the fact that they.</v>

804
00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.860
<v Speaker 1>These guys are playing a game and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is just the propaganda news network.</v>

805
00:37:16.861 --> 00:37:17.694
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a propaganda news network </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the left and his propaganda news </v>

806
00:37:20.221 --> 00:37:23.430
<v Speaker 1>network for the right and they're both </v>
<v Speaker 1>guilty guilty of both guilty.</v>

807
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:24.293
<v Speaker 1>No one's being honest about her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's having this conversation that </v>

808
00:37:26.401 --> 00:37:28.410
<v Speaker 1>we're having where we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

809
00:37:28.411 --> 00:37:31.980
<v Speaker 1>maybe wouldn't be the worst idea in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world to get someone in there who's some</v>

810
00:37:31.981 --> 00:37:36.090
<v Speaker 1>crazy rich guy who's this gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that'll stir things up.</v>

811
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe like having a guy like him </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be a doorway to having someone who</v>

812
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:43.283
<v Speaker 1>has like some next level view of running</v>
<v Speaker 1>government and including people in the </v>

813
00:37:48.031 --> 00:37:51.060
<v Speaker 1>process and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and moving it away from this.</v>

814
00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:52.213
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system is too restrictive and it's </v>

815
00:37:53.641 --> 00:37:56.370
<v Speaker 1>too restrictive based on the times in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which it was creative.</v>

816
00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:00.690
<v Speaker 1>The representative government model that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they needed in 1776.</v>

817
00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:05.430
<v Speaker 1>It's a very different world today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 2016.</v>

818
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that the bigger culprit may</v>

819
00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.970
<v Speaker 1>be less systemic like you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

820
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:13.103
<v Speaker 1>I actually think the bigger culprit is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong ideas are starting to win the </v>

821
00:38:15.721 --> 00:38:17.310
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's what I mean.</v>

822
00:38:17.790 --> 00:38:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

823
00:38:18.841 --> 00:38:21.480
<v Speaker 1>let's just take the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just take the hysterical left.</v>

824
00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think by the way,</v>

825
00:38:23.851 --> 00:38:24.684
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more of a libertarian so that maybe </v>

826
00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:31.350
<v Speaker 1>would make me maybe more swing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're both pretty left a lot of stuff.</v>

827
00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:32.213
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was about to say it was about to </v>

828
00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.190
<v Speaker 1>categorize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem is these categories,</v>

829
00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:35.980
<v Speaker 1>categories are</v>

830
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.813
<v Speaker 4>fucking stupid to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's super left on almost every social </v>

831
00:38:41.261 --> 00:38:42.094
<v Speaker 4>issue on welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on government programs to help </v>

832
00:38:46.571 --> 00:38:50.260
<v Speaker 4>communities and boys clubs and girls </v>
<v Speaker 4>clubs and things along those lines.</v>

833
00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:52.370
<v Speaker 3>You're making my point for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

834
00:38:52.371 --> 00:38:53.204
<v Speaker 3>So when I say left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I really mean when I say I'm a </v>

835
00:38:55.671 --> 00:38:57.320
<v Speaker 3>libertarian?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do I mean by that?</v>

836
00:38:57.321 --> 00:38:59.030
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm not a total libertarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

837
00:38:59.031 --> 00:39:01.370
<v Speaker 3>So here's a better way is exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to say.</v>

838
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:02.383
<v Speaker 3>Here's a much better way of establishing</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of where you stand and rather than </v>

839
00:39:08.601 --> 00:39:09.434
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people over here are wrong and </v>

840
00:39:10.761 --> 00:39:12.110
<v Speaker 3>these people over here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

841
00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Or these people are left to right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you're doing is categorizing people</v>

842
00:39:16.011 --> 00:39:17.840
<v Speaker 3>and we know that people are all over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

843
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:21.020
<v Speaker 3>Look at you and I left this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm socially very liberal.</v>

844
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:24.080
<v Speaker 3>I believe in fair play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also believe in common sense.</v>

845
00:39:24.081 --> 00:39:26.120
<v Speaker 3>I also believe in personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

846
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:28.370
<v Speaker 3>That's where it gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You start moving right?</v>

847
00:39:28.371 --> 00:39:29.151
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

848
00:39:29.151 --> 00:39:30.500
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's called.</v>

849
00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:35.620
<v Speaker 3>That's called being occupying the entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual and emotional spectrum as a</v>

850
00:39:36.861 --> 00:39:37.400
<v Speaker 3>human being.</v>

851
00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.233
<v Speaker 3>What a surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a sinner and I'm a St Motherfucker </v>

852
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:43.280
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of times I'm in the joker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joker,</v>

853
00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.160
<v Speaker 3>and a smoker as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

854
00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:47.300
<v Speaker 3>midnight Toker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they don't want to run.</v>

855
00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:49.040
<v Speaker 3>Fuck no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stand.</v>

856
00:39:49.041 --> 00:39:52.580
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I set my heels and I fucking Dr Steve.</v>

857
00:39:52.581 --> 00:39:54.080
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bought my own fucking tongue.</v>

858
00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.430
<v Speaker 3>Whoa easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the.</v>

859
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:56.480
<v Speaker 3>Here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a better way.</v>

860
00:39:56.481 --> 00:39:57.500
<v Speaker 3>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the enemy,</v>

861
00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.910
<v Speaker 3>not a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the enemy.</v>

862
00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:03.080
<v Speaker 3>It's this at one example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this thought process.</v>

863
00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.750
<v Speaker 3>We have a disenfranchised group over </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

864
00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:09.680
<v Speaker 3>Let's call them transsexuals or let's </v>
<v Speaker 3>call them black people,</v>

865
00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:10.693
<v Speaker 3>or let's call them women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you lumped all those </v>

866
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:15.020
<v Speaker 3>three people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

867
00:40:15.021 --> 00:40:16.430
<v Speaker 3>we do this with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just take.</v>

868
00:40:16.431 --> 00:40:17.264
<v Speaker 3>Let's take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's take the fact that women are </v>

869
00:40:18.741 --> 00:40:20.740
<v Speaker 3>victims of sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

870
00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.990
<v Speaker 3>We've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've established that sexual assault is</v>

871
00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:25.250
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's define what it is,</v>

872
00:40:25.251 --> 00:40:27.100
<v Speaker 3>but we know that for the most part it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>a problem.</v>

873
00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:28.760
<v Speaker 3>It's a terrible thing when it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

874
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about rape now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

875
00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:33.670
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

876
00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:34.603
<v Speaker 3>we know we want to solve that or make it</v>
<v Speaker 3>better or make women safer and make the </v>

877
00:40:37.251 --> 00:40:41.480
<v Speaker 3>world safer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what happens is a lot of times,</v>

878
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:46.700
<v Speaker 3>one group that one thought process in </v>
<v Speaker 3>solving that problem is as follows,</v>

879
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:48.980
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's find out who's doing the raping.</v>

880
00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:50.600
<v Speaker 3>It's mad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's mad.</v>

881
00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:51.943
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what we're going to do is make it </v>

882
00:40:53.901 --> 00:40:57.350
<v Speaker 3>better because we are going the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to make a bit as we're going</v>

883
00:40:57.351 --> 00:41:02.351
<v Speaker 3>to take the power away from those men </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're gonna get somewhere else.</v>

884
00:41:03.621 --> 00:41:04.580
<v Speaker 3>And how are we going to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

885
00:41:04.581 --> 00:41:06.170
<v Speaker 3>there's only one way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need a,</v>

886
00:41:06.171 --> 00:41:07.970
<v Speaker 3>you need a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>

887
00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:12.200
<v Speaker 3>powerful authority to actually be able </v>
<v Speaker 3>to enforce that.</v>

888
00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.010
<v Speaker 3>You need laws and you need regulations </v>
<v Speaker 3>and union restrictions.</v>

889
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:20.690
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that by you will make </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone else who's not powerful,</v>

890
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:25.750
<v Speaker 3>more powerful by putting down people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are already powerful by taking that</v>

891
00:41:26.481 --> 00:41:27.314
<v Speaker 3>power away from them financially or with</v>
<v Speaker 3>laws as if that is going to make the </v>

892
00:41:33.111 --> 00:41:37.610
<v Speaker 3>people who have been oppressed as it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to make their lives better.</v>

893
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:42.470
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a faulty way of thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that empowers women.</v>

894
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.570
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that empowers black </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

895
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:45.404
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think rather personal responsibility </v>

896
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:54.130
<v Speaker 3>and making it so that that group can </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out how to empower themselves and</v>

897
00:41:54.621 --> 00:41:57.680
<v Speaker 3>the way you empower yourself is not by </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking power from somebody else.</v>

898
00:41:58.090 --> 00:41:59.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean unless they were there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

899
00:41:59.591 --> 00:42:02.480
<v Speaker 3>a sadist and keeping you in a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for the most part,</v>

900
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:07.250
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a very important </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinction and discussion to have.</v>

901
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.860
<v Speaker 3>That's the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the debate.</v>

902
00:42:09.861 --> 00:42:12.500
<v Speaker 3>I'd love to hear between CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox,</v>

903
00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:13.080
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

904
00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.320
<v Speaker 4>I also think there's a big problem with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this right?</v>

905
00:42:16.321 --> 00:42:17.154
<v Speaker 4>And left system in the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You pick a side and you want that side </v>

906
00:42:20.041 --> 00:42:22.380
<v Speaker 4>to win and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

907
00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:24.660
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like a civil war in America </v>
<v Speaker 4>every time.</v>

908
00:42:24.661 --> 00:42:27.870
<v Speaker 4>The [inaudible] elections come up and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think it's bogus.</v>

909
00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:28.913
<v Speaker 4>I think the whole setup is bogus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the distinction between the two </v>

910
00:42:31.501 --> 00:42:32.334
<v Speaker 4>groups is bogus and I think we're so </v>
<v Speaker 4>used to having teams compete against </v>

911
00:42:35.341 --> 00:42:38.970
<v Speaker 4>teams that we slide right into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what we really should be worried</v>

912
00:42:38.971 --> 00:42:41.260
<v Speaker 4>about is who's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

913
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:44.130
<v Speaker 4>there should be a set of things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all worried about.</v>

914
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:48.090
<v Speaker 4>Who is ruining the party?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's,</v>

915
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:49.050
<v Speaker 4>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's,</v>

916
00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:49.903
<v Speaker 4>who's doing terrible things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are they as it people that are </v>

917
00:42:52.051 --> 00:42:52.884
<v Speaker 4>robbing people's that people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>selling meth is the people that are </v>

918
00:42:55.111 --> 00:42:57.420
<v Speaker 4>murdering people who's doing all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's ruining the party.</v>

919
00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.070
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well first we got to find them.</v>

920
00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:01.170
<v Speaker 4>It might be the people that are driving </v>
<v Speaker 4>the narrative.</v>

921
00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:02.111
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should be the.</v>

922
00:43:02.111 --> 00:43:04.440
<v Speaker 4>This should be the entire focus of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>

923
00:43:04.441 --> 00:43:05.370
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Second of all,</v>

924
00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.560
<v Speaker 4>where are the weak links in our chains?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we're.</v>

925
00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:10.530
<v Speaker 4>How are these poor people supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get by?</v>

926
00:43:10.531 --> 00:43:12.330
<v Speaker 4>How were they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're born into poverty.</v>

927
00:43:12.331 --> 00:43:13.640
<v Speaker 4>They're born into shitty parents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

928
00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:14.663
<v Speaker 4>how do we fucking nip that in the bud?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we have less people that are just </v>

929
00:43:16.411 --> 00:43:20.370
<v Speaker 4>suffering through the emotional baggage </v>
<v Speaker 4>of being raised by fuckheads.</v>

930
00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.253
<v Speaker 4>There are different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are different schools of thought </v>

931
00:43:22.321 --> 00:43:22.920
<v Speaker 4>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

932
00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.240
<v Speaker 4>So that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

933
00:43:24.241 --> 00:43:25.920
<v Speaker 4>there are different schools of thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but let me keep going.</v>

934
00:43:25.921 --> 00:43:27.330
<v Speaker 4>And then W,</v>
<v Speaker 4>W why?</v>

935
00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:30.660
<v Speaker 4>Why the fuck would we fight Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why are we in Afghanistan?</v>

936
00:43:30.661 --> 00:43:31.494
<v Speaker 4>Why would we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would anybody do any of these </v>

937
00:43:32.401 --> 00:43:32.910
<v Speaker 4>things?</v>

938
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:33.743
<v Speaker 4>Like at what point in time is it going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be ridiculous for the idea of giant </v>

939
00:43:37.171 --> 00:43:38.004
<v Speaker 4>groups of people to go over and try to </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck up other giant groups of people </v>

940
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:41.333
<v Speaker 4>that are all in on it together for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>profits of some person who probably </v>

941
00:43:44.011 --> 00:43:44.844
<v Speaker 4>doesn't give a fuck about you and is </v>
<v Speaker 4>super happy to let you go to war for </v>

942
00:43:47.521 --> 00:43:48.354
<v Speaker 4>them so they can get more oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The same reason people argue the same </v>

943
00:43:50.551 --> 00:43:51.384
<v Speaker 4>people that people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason people have different points </v>

944
00:43:52.561 --> 00:43:54.330
<v Speaker 4>of view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The two party thing,</v>

945
00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:58.590
<v Speaker 4>it's the two team thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the natural inclination that people</v>

946
00:43:58.591 --> 00:44:01.620
<v Speaker 4>have to compete against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even on a global scale.</v>

947
00:44:01.621 --> 00:44:02.454
<v Speaker 4>If it keeps ramping up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure it works that way with like </v>

948
00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:06.750
<v Speaker 4>billionaires that like they want to have</v>
<v Speaker 4>the biggest yacht,</v>

949
00:44:06.751 --> 00:44:08.640
<v Speaker 4>like having a giant yacht.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not good enough.</v>

950
00:44:08.641 --> 00:44:12.240
<v Speaker 4>They want the biggest yacht ever and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they keep competing against each other.</v>

951
00:44:12.241 --> 00:44:13.860
<v Speaker 4>It's just isn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that human?</v>

952
00:44:13.861 --> 00:44:15.750
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that the human condition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that conflict,</v>

953
00:44:15.751 --> 00:44:19.770
<v Speaker 4>that need to impose your own?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really,</v>

954
00:44:19.771 --> 00:44:21.600
<v Speaker 4>you're on mark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know you.</v>

955
00:44:21.601 --> 00:44:23.970
<v Speaker 4>If you would ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you try to change that,</v>

956
00:44:23.971 --> 00:44:25.420
<v Speaker 4>you're trying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're messing with human saints.</v>

957
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:29.610
<v Speaker 4>The problem is with having anyone being </v>
<v Speaker 4>a figurehead,</v>

958
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:32.060
<v Speaker 4>I think once you have who's a figurehead</v>
<v Speaker 4>and</v>

959
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.460
<v Speaker 1>that figurehead position becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>coveted position.</v>

960
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:37.530
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very important.</v>

961
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.810
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a goal and once it becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>

962
00:44:39.811 --> 00:44:40.644
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get the super </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive people that are trying to </v>

963
00:44:41.611 --> 00:44:42.444
<v Speaker 1>achieve that goal and then along the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start realizing that they can sell </v>

964
00:44:45.991 --> 00:44:50.010
<v Speaker 1>influence and speeches and that Bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton got paid half a million bucks,</v>

965
00:44:50.011 --> 00:44:54.340
<v Speaker 1>had talked to these people for an hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Hillary Clinton got 250,000</v>

966
00:44:54.341 --> 00:44:55.174
<v Speaker 1>and talk to some bankers for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's like there's so much money in </v>

967
00:44:57.661 --> 00:44:58.494
<v Speaker 1>it that they start realizing like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>position carries with it an incredible </v>

968
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:05.280
<v Speaker 1>fiscal windfall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called an economy of influence.</v>

969
00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:08.430
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how Switzerland is ruled.</v>

970
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:11.130
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting how they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have a lot of different parties,</v>

971
00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.033
<v Speaker 1>lots of different parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the first three parties that when </v>

972
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:17.970
<v Speaker 1>are voted in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get to choose two presidents each.</v>

973
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those.</v>

974
00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.213
<v Speaker 1>And then the fourth party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the party that comes in fourth place </v>

975
00:45:22.261 --> 00:45:25.680
<v Speaker 1>with the fourth number of votes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get to elect one president.</v>

976
00:45:25.890 --> 00:45:26.723
<v Speaker 1>So you actually have seven presidents </v>
<v Speaker 1>way better idea and not only have seven </v>

977
00:45:30.421 --> 00:45:31.950
<v Speaker 1>presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all have regular jobs.</v>

978
00:45:31.951 --> 00:45:34.150
<v Speaker 1>That's not their only job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they meet,</v>

979
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.650
<v Speaker 1>they meet and they discuss legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but guess what else?</v>

980
00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:40.050
<v Speaker 1>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those groups are the ones.</v>

981
00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Those parties are the ones that elected </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own.</v>

982
00:45:42.271 --> 00:45:45.120
<v Speaker 1>They're their own presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

983
00:45:45.121 --> 00:45:46.920
<v Speaker 1>but what do they have to worry about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

984
00:45:46.921 --> 00:45:48.990
<v Speaker 1>someone's invading to steal our cheese </v>
<v Speaker 1>in our army.</v>

985
00:45:48.991 --> 00:45:49.950
<v Speaker 1>Knives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the great.</v>

986
00:45:49.951 --> 00:45:51.720
<v Speaker 1>What's the great quote?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was descended?</v>

987
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.823
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500 years of continual warfare in Italy </v>

988
00:45:56.700 --> 00:45:57.533
<v Speaker 1>gave rise to the renaissance and 500 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of relative peace in Switzerland </v>

989
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:07.710
<v Speaker 1>gave rise to the cuckoo clock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful clock.</v>

990
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And the chicks are hot.</v>

991
00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:09.913
<v Speaker 1>Why build things when you can just fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the girls that lived there because </v>

992
00:46:12.121 --> 00:46:13.410
<v Speaker 1>they're just super hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

993
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:17.340
<v Speaker 1>this term onto something or does turmoil</v>
<v Speaker 1>create beauty and it may be.</v>

994
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:20.340
<v Speaker 1>What is innovation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of destruction was beauty.</v>

995
00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:22.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's more beautiful,</v>

996
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:25.620
<v Speaker 1>peaceful day just overlooking a field or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Vatican.</v>

997
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I have an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you're wrong.</v>

998
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know how the Greeks top man,</v>

999
00:46:29.851 --> 00:46:30.684
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know the Greeks defined it in one </v>

1000
00:46:31.681 --> 00:46:33.740
<v Speaker 1>word that you enroll Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How becky?</v>

1001
00:46:33.741 --> 00:46:36.240
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you hold your breath and started</v>

1002
00:46:36.241 --> 00:46:40.090
<v Speaker 1>smelling trump?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is trump's breath smell like?</v>

1003
00:46:40.091 --> 00:46:40.924
<v Speaker 1>You had to guess I can meet and for sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of flame and yon and they just </v>

1004
00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:51.680
<v Speaker 1>just meet and oppression and depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wash and a wasp flies out.</v>

1005
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:54.780
<v Speaker 1>Stinks you in the face once a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1006
00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I bet you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what the irony is?</v>

1007
00:46:56.101 --> 00:46:58.110
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee he'd be a fun guy to hang </v>
<v Speaker 1>out with.</v>

1008
00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:00.150
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking blast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1009
00:47:00.151 --> 00:47:01.380
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Use it.</v>

1010
00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:04.350
<v Speaker 1>He'd probably be one of my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>people even though Jeff Ross said he was</v>

1011
00:47:04.351 --> 00:47:05.250
<v Speaker 1>great when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1012
00:47:05.251 --> 00:47:06.720
<v Speaker 1>they roasted them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was great.</v>

1013
00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:11.700
<v Speaker 1>He said he even advised him to laugh at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the jokes about him and he's like,</v>

1014
00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:13.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1015
00:47:13.201 --> 00:47:14.034
<v Speaker 1>it's probably better if you laugh along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't want people to think you </v>

1016
00:47:16.801 --> 00:47:17.880
<v Speaker 1>don't have a sense of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

1017
00:47:17.881 --> 00:47:18.714
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

1018
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:20.820
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

1019
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:22.580
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a,</v>

1020
00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:24.330
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a great American figure.</v>

1021
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.680
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1022
00:47:25.681 --> 00:47:26.514
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say great in terms of like </v>

1023
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

1024
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.860
<v Speaker 4>overall influence that he's having on </v>
<v Speaker 4>people right now,</v>

1025
00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:37.990
<v Speaker 4>but as far as him being a great figure </v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of like big,</v>

1026
00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:39.183
<v Speaker 4>he's a huge historical figure yet is on </v>
<v Speaker 4>an airline for awhile has been this </v>

1027
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:47.910
<v Speaker 4>figure in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this sort of a symbol of wealth,</v>

1028
00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.580
<v Speaker 4>but he's all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also revitalized a lot of political</v>

1029
00:47:51.581 --> 00:47:52.414
<v Speaker 4>discussion</v>

1030
00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:53.453
<v Speaker 3>because I was forced to explain and </v>
<v Speaker 3>articulate and think about why he's </v>

1031
00:47:58.441 --> 00:47:59.274
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was forced to look up words like </v>

1032
00:48:00.751 --> 00:48:01.584
<v Speaker 3>demagogue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have to look that ladies and </v>

1033
00:48:02.581 --> 00:48:03.540
<v Speaker 3>gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean,</v>

1034
00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:08.220
<v Speaker 3>but I was forced to do all these things </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that in a way is good.</v>

1035
00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean that in a way you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to have somebody to go,</v>

1036
00:48:10.321 --> 00:48:11.000
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

1037
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.470
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't afford to be,</v>

1038
00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:14.340
<v Speaker 3>to not be politically committed right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

1039
00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.380
<v Speaker 3>And here's another reason I don't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hillary.</v>

1040
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:18.820
<v Speaker 3>The uranium one deal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and here's the way there.</v>

1041
00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:22.170
<v Speaker 3>The reason I don't like trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least it got me thinking and talking.</v>

1042
00:48:22.171 --> 00:48:25.170
<v Speaker 3>We're all talking about it and and </v>
<v Speaker 3>younger people are listening to podcasts</v>

1043
00:48:25.171 --> 00:48:26.910
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least listening.</v>

1044
00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:28.500
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they agree,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe they don't,</v>

1045
00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:32.340
<v Speaker 3>but hopefully both so that they can then</v>
<v Speaker 3>formulate their own opinion.</v>

1046
00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.060
<v Speaker 4>Eddie Bravo things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to war with Russia.</v>

1047
00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:35.740
<v Speaker 4>Alrighty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1048
00:48:35.741 --> 00:48:39.760
<v Speaker 4>Eddie's done a lot of the big fear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The big fear in the conservative,</v>

1049
00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:41.170
<v Speaker 4>the conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

1050
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:42.103
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy theory world is this has been</v>
<v Speaker 4>explained to me that they think that </v>

1051
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:48.123
<v Speaker 4>they're going to start a war with Russia</v>
<v Speaker 4>to distract us from the wikileaks </v>

1052
00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:56.500
<v Speaker 4>wikileaks revelations because there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>new ones that are coming out.</v>

1053
00:48:56.501 --> 00:48:59.500
<v Speaker 4>Apparently new wiki leaks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stuff's coming out and as if,</v>

1054
00:48:59.501 --> 00:49:02.710
<v Speaker 4>as if people don't have enemies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody's anatomy in government.</v>

1055
00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.240
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't answer my question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They cut.</v>

1056
00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:06.790
<v Speaker 4>Julian assange is a Internet connection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What question was that?</v>

1057
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:10.170
<v Speaker 4>How do you define beauty as one word?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1058
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:11.320
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's what?</v>

1059
00:49:11.321 --> 00:49:13.870
<v Speaker 4>The Greeks and rambled for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forgot what the fuck you suck.</v>

1060
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:14.763
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did Not wanna make sure Fran bold </v>

1061
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:19.440
<v Speaker 4>Richard brambles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1062
00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:21.130
<v Speaker 4>you're ready for it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1063
00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.900
<v Speaker 4>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is how you define beauty.</v>

1064
00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:24.550
<v Speaker 4>How harmony.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

1065
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:26.650
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you see a cheetah running,</v>

1066
00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:29.080
<v Speaker 4>why is it beautiful?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All moving parts,</v>

1067
00:49:29.081 --> 00:49:30.940
<v Speaker 4>all the parts and moving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if it's running it,</v>

1068
00:49:30.941 --> 00:49:33.940
<v Speaker 4>you're so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's horrible running at your kid.</v>

1069
00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:35.110
<v Speaker 4>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it.</v>

1070
00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:36.610
<v Speaker 4>If it's running at your kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that beautiful?</v>

1071
00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.020
<v Speaker 4>Good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a horror show.</v>

1072
00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:42.610
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful beauty is without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the old expression goes in the eye of</v>

1073
00:49:42.611 --> 00:49:45.220
<v Speaker 4>the beholder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Certain people like certain things,</v>

1074
00:49:45.221 --> 00:49:47.890
<v Speaker 4>certain people like certain kinds of art</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I find disgusting.</v>

1075
00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.950
<v Speaker 4>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They love certain kinds of music.</v>

1076
00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:53.980
<v Speaker 4>They love certain features on people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They love certain looks.</v>

1077
00:49:53.981 --> 00:49:57.400
<v Speaker 4>As far as clothing goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's whatever the fuck you think it is.</v>

1078
00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:59.380
<v Speaker 4>If it's beautiful to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's ridiculous.</v>

1079
00:49:59.381 --> 00:50:02.770
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>few physical beauty and the human being.</v>

1080
00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:05.950
<v Speaker 4>The difference between a person who's </v>
<v Speaker 4>cheeks are this wide,</v>

1081
00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:06.813
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like five inches wide or seven inches </v>

1082
00:50:09.461 --> 00:50:09.940
<v Speaker 4>wide.</v>

1083
00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.430
<v Speaker 4>That extra two inches can make you look </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a fucking Weirdo.</v>

1084
00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.560
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Symmetry,</v>

1085
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:18.670
<v Speaker 4>symmetry and proportion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about just the way you look.</v>

1086
00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:20.143
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not that it throws you off because you </v>

1087
00:50:21.321 --> 00:50:23.060
<v Speaker 4>look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the FIBONACCI sequence of a person,</v>

1088
00:50:23.061 --> 00:50:24.970
<v Speaker 4>like that's what happens when someone </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets a nose job,</v>

1089
00:50:24.971 --> 00:50:28.310
<v Speaker 4>you know if they have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a naturally huge and they get that bitch</v>

1090
00:50:28.311 --> 00:50:29.144
<v Speaker 4>chopped down on something little will </v>
<v Speaker 4>look weird about their face to you </v>

1091
00:50:32.181 --> 00:50:36.470
<v Speaker 4>because your brain is used to looking at</v>
<v Speaker 4>things in a very distinct sequence.</v>

1092
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:37.453
<v Speaker 4>The FIBONACCI sequence which exists on </v>
<v Speaker 4>nautilus shells and sunflower seeds and </v>

1093
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:42.740
<v Speaker 4>all these different versions of it in </v>
<v Speaker 4>nature,</v>

1094
00:50:42.741 --> 00:50:45.950
<v Speaker 4>but it also you can use that sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can use that,</v>

1095
00:50:45.951 --> 00:50:50.390
<v Speaker 4>those measurements to show roughly what </v>
<v Speaker 4>a person's facial features will be like.</v>

1096
00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:51.613
<v Speaker 4>They're all kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they say so when you surgically mess </v>

1097
00:50:53.511 --> 00:50:54.070
<v Speaker 4>with that?</v>

1098
00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:54.903
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fuck with the whole outline of your </v>

1099
00:50:57.201 --> 00:50:58.034
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like when you see someone and </v>

1100
00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.570
<v Speaker 4>their lips are way too big and their </v>
<v Speaker 4>mouth is stretched too wide,</v>

1101
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:05.600
<v Speaker 4>so you know they've got started fillers </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the horn.</v>

1102
00:51:05.601 --> 00:51:07.860
<v Speaker 4>If it keeps going and some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1103
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:10.580
<v Speaker 4>a neck job where their faces pulled </v>
<v Speaker 4>back,</v>

1104
00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:14.150
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're immediately like your math is off</v>

1105
00:51:14.151 --> 00:51:15.490
<v Speaker 4>on them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're looking at them,</v>

1106
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.820
<v Speaker 4>you're like my math off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1107
00:51:16.821 --> 00:51:18.230
<v Speaker 4>why is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are your lips so big?</v>

1108
00:51:18.231 --> 00:51:21.840
<v Speaker 4>Like this isn't dogs I think will be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I've seen my neighbor used,</v>

1109
00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:24.200
<v Speaker 4>do a lot of below.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My dog would flip the.</v>

1110
00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:25.070
<v Speaker 4>She'd come and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1111
00:51:25.071 --> 00:51:26.080
<v Speaker 4>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>In my thought was like,</v>

1112
00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:27.890
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get the fuck away from me.</v>

1113
00:51:27.891 --> 00:51:31.600
<v Speaker 4>Like my dog immediately knew some shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>was wrong with the way she was moving a.</v>

1114
00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:32.483
<v Speaker 4>But that's someone who on coke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was probably aggressive to your dog </v>

1115
00:51:35.211 --> 00:51:36.230
<v Speaker 4>too and you're wearing around.</v>

1116
00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:37.483
<v Speaker 4>She's probably maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or she was just talking with my dog was </v>

1117
00:51:39.231 --> 00:51:41.720
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like this fucking person maybe,</v>

1118
00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.560
<v Speaker 4>but I'm what the fuck we were talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

1119
00:51:44.561 --> 00:51:45.394
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we got to do something before </v>

1120
00:51:48.111 --> 00:51:48.944
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clarity and how beauty is beauty is </v>

1121
00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:51.920
<v Speaker 4>dictates contextual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1122
00:51:51.921 --> 00:51:52.754
<v Speaker 4>It's weird how like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's certain things if people just </v>

1123
00:51:54.861 --> 00:51:55.694
<v Speaker 4>decide or beautiful and there's certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that are beautiful to certain </v>

1124
00:51:58.491 --> 00:52:01.130
<v Speaker 4>people that just don't resonate with </v>
<v Speaker 4>others at all,</v>

1125
00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.370
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And certain people or certain looks.</v>

1126
00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.233
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's guys that are legitimately into </v>

1127
00:52:06.321 --> 00:52:08.200
<v Speaker 4>morbidly obese women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1128
00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.253
<v Speaker 4>Really enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's at new podcasts would </v>

1129
00:52:11.511 --> 00:52:12.344
<v Speaker 4>disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I listened to that podcast and Gad said </v>

1130
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:15.103
<v Speaker 4>was talking about how even congenitally </v>
<v Speaker 4>he went through a whole litany of </v>

1131
00:52:17.571 --> 00:52:22.040
<v Speaker 4>reasons why hip to waist ratio and </v>
<v Speaker 4>breast size and all that stuff and,</v>

1132
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:22.903
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>symmetry and proportion are biological </v>

1133
00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:31.300
<v Speaker 4>triggers for men and the idea that there</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't a standard of beauty that turns on</v>

1134
00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.140
<v Speaker 4>men in general.</v>

1135
00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:34.190
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1136
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:36.440
<v Speaker 4>and that's what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there absolutely is of course,</v>

1137
00:52:36.441 --> 00:52:38.910
<v Speaker 4>but there's certainly upset exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1138
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:40.023
<v Speaker 4>there is a giant SPEC.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why some guys are gay because </v>

1139
00:52:42.861 --> 00:52:43.694
<v Speaker 4>that's their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where they fall into the </v>

1140
00:52:44.481 --> 00:52:45.081
<v Speaker 4>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their,</v>

1141
00:52:45.081 --> 00:52:46.760
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their beauty to them,</v>

1142
00:52:46.761 --> 00:52:49.150
<v Speaker 4>what they're attracted to his men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1143
00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:53.720
<v Speaker 4>and there's gonna be certain versions of</v>
<v Speaker 4>men that are attracted to all kinds of,</v>

1144
00:52:53.721 --> 00:52:57.170
<v Speaker 4>some kinds are attracted to giant lemon </v>
<v Speaker 4>that can carry them around.</v>

1145
00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:59.330
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember our crum?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shared to hearsay.</v>

1146
00:52:59.331 --> 00:53:02.170
<v Speaker 4>Sad documentary is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

1147
00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:06.410
<v Speaker 4>I knew about him because our neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was a kid,</v>

1148
00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:07.610
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my parents were hippies.</v>

1149
00:53:07.611 --> 00:53:10.730
<v Speaker 4>We live in San Francisco from a age </v>
<v Speaker 4>seven to 11.</v>

1150
00:53:10.731 --> 00:53:14.300
<v Speaker 4>I lived in San Francisco and we had </v>
<v Speaker 4>these crazy neighbors.</v>

1151
00:53:14.301 --> 00:53:16.160
<v Speaker 4>He's gay guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My aunt used to smoke pot,</v>

1152
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.430
<v Speaker 4>go next door and they would go get naked</v>
<v Speaker 4>and play bongos together.</v>

1153
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:20.503
<v Speaker 4>This guy was black as the sky on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a moonless night and he would get </v>

1154
00:53:25.441 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 4>high as fuck</v>

1155
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:28.860
<v Speaker 1>and take all his clothes off and he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>gay and his boyfriend,</v>

1156
00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:29.713
<v Speaker 1>they would live together and they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would all just get naked and play </v>

1157
00:53:32.401 --> 00:53:33.234
<v Speaker 1>bongos together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My aunt would go down there and get </v>

1158
00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:35.850
<v Speaker 1>baked with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

1159
00:53:35.851 --> 00:53:36.684
<v Speaker 1>they had these comic books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had our crum and there was the </v>

1160
00:53:39.571 --> 00:53:41.240
<v Speaker 1>first time I was ever exposed to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>crump.</v>

1161
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Weird guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well No,</v>

1162
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:45.090
<v Speaker 1>they would carry him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1163
00:53:45.091 --> 00:53:46.950
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had giant legs,</v>

1164
00:53:46.951 --> 00:53:49.410
<v Speaker 1>enormous classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They looked like avatar.</v>

1165
00:53:49.411 --> 00:53:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Women like they didn't even look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were real powerful.</v>

1166
00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:54.360
<v Speaker 1>So he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was into like,</v>

1167
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:55.253
<v Speaker 1>like see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's got this all this power </v>

1168
00:53:57.001 --> 00:53:57.834
<v Speaker 1>illuminating office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman's giant legs and she looks like </v>

1169
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.313
<v Speaker 1>what you would see today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like from some crazy mega crossfit type </v>

1170
00:54:03.571 --> 00:54:05.880
<v Speaker 1>chick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like their big muscular legs.</v>

1171
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.823
<v Speaker 1>That was what he was into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if though those kinds of </v>

1172
00:54:11.251 --> 00:54:12.640
<v Speaker 1>examples are.</v>

1173
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:14.790
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

1174
00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:18.300
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of what your aberration,</v>

1175
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:21.930
<v Speaker 1>you're a perversion fetish is whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to call the word.</v>

1176
00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I think though that that still doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean that they don't and can't recognize</v>

1177
00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:30.420
<v Speaker 1>what would it be considered harmonious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1178
00:54:30.421 --> 00:54:32.040
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I tell her,</v>

1179
00:54:32.041 --> 00:54:36.900
<v Speaker 1>obviously he keeps taking drawing photos</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these girls with giant legs and giant</v>

1180
00:54:36.901 --> 00:54:37.734
<v Speaker 1>muscles and it says back that off a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little so I could read the how to have </v>

1181
00:54:40.321 --> 00:54:43.770
<v Speaker 1>fun with a strong girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stand before,</v>

1182
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:44.633
<v Speaker 1>before her trembling with anticipation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then she struts and prances around the </v>

1183
00:54:47.671 --> 00:54:48.504
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boldly displaying her magnificent </v>

1184
00:54:49.981 --> 00:54:50.814
<v Speaker 1>physique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's full of narcissistic pride is </v>

1185
00:54:52.741 --> 00:54:56.430
<v Speaker 1>obviously enjoying the effect she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>having on me and it's him.</v>

1186
00:54:56.431 --> 00:54:57.264
<v Speaker 1>Our chrome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was just nerdy looking guy and he's </v>

1187
00:54:59.311 --> 00:55:03.210
<v Speaker 1>got boxer shorts on with a boner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>socks and his hairy legs.</v>

1188
00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:04.213
<v Speaker 1>Really hilarious writing and hilarious </v>
<v Speaker 1>artwork and that was what he was all </v>

1189
00:55:08.521 --> 00:55:10.470
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all this weird perverted shit.</v>

1190
00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:12.960
<v Speaker 1>So I got exposed to this stuff when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1191
00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:15.240
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was like eight,</v>

1192
00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.580
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around eight or nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1193
00:55:17.581 --> 00:55:20.670
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this guy into like giant women?</v>

1194
00:55:20.671 --> 00:55:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

1195
00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:23.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he had a bunch of different like </v>

1196
00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:25.260
<v Speaker 1>characters that he would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1197
00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.740
<v Speaker 1>draw and all of these weird comic books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1198
00:55:28.741 --> 00:55:29.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1199
00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:31.270
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a girl at a giant in,</v>

1200
00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:34.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really weird her first day in the</v>

1201
00:55:34.681 --> 00:55:36.030
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is,</v>

1202
00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I saw this kind of stuff when I was real</v>
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>

1203
00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well how do you explain this?</v>

1204
00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:42.220
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the,</v>

1205
00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.890
<v Speaker 1>all that asshole hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

1206
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:46.350
<v Speaker 1>It's such a good piece coming out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>his nose in the air.</v>

1207
00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1208
00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:49.013
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that messes with my </v>

1209
00:55:50.371 --> 00:55:51.204
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that title that's going to be </v>

1210
00:55:52.321 --> 00:55:54.000
<v Speaker 1>my next tattoo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My first tattoo.</v>

1211
00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Her first day in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're looking for it,</v>

1212
00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:01.740
<v Speaker 1>Google that original art crumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>

1213
00:56:01.741 --> 00:56:06.000
<v Speaker 1>The rest snatches snatch comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the snatch?</v>

1214
00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:07.313
<v Speaker 1>So he had a lot of vagina base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's stepping into her vagina and he's </v>

1215
00:56:10.321 --> 00:56:12.540
<v Speaker 1>looking around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's looking around at this.</v>

1216
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Notice that giant vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's about to step to step into it.</v>

1217
00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contract type hood.</v>

1218
00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:18.653
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a type could sure get last round </v>

1219
00:56:22.101 --> 00:56:25.810
<v Speaker 1>here and not to step into her vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks like a chicken.</v>

1220
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:29.930
<v Speaker 1>Looks like I'm a tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's hoping.</v>

1221
00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Take City woman been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1222
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:35.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a metaphor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's,</v>

1223
00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:40.120
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing that's confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am very attracted to crossfit.</v>

1224
00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Very muscular women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's hot,</v>

1225
00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:42.610
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1226
00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:44.680
<v Speaker 1>So I'd love to have one that can beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ass.</v>

1227
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:45.543
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just like that power in the legs and </v>

1228
00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.150
<v Speaker 1>like a message you'd like them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>underestimate you and you without russel</v>

1229
00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:50.980
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that your move?</v>

1230
00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean that has been in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's less.</v>

1231
00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:56.860
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when I see a crossfit woman,</v>

1232
00:56:56.861 --> 00:56:57.694
<v Speaker 1>like a woman who's just got a blow out </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass and powerful legs and all that and </v>

1233
00:57:00.431 --> 00:57:01.264
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back on her,</v>

1234
00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:02.253
<v Speaker 1>maybe I want to breed with our swipes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe primarily I want to be with </v>

1235
00:57:04.781 --> 00:57:06.310
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my kids are studs,</v>

1236
00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:08.890
<v Speaker 1>but I just find it physically very </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>

1237
00:57:08.891 --> 00:57:11.340
<v Speaker 1>When a girl's got to an asset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should find our chrome.</v>

1238
00:57:11.341 --> 00:57:12.930
<v Speaker 1>He lives in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you could hang out.</v>

1239
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:14.320
<v Speaker 1>You could just jerk off together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1240
00:57:14.321 --> 00:57:16.750
<v Speaker 1>hold on because you're drawing Sarah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>

1241
00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:17.710
<v Speaker 1>hold on sir.</v>

1242
00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Because then there's the other side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>me that likes a super feminine,</v>

1243
00:57:21.731 --> 00:57:22.564
<v Speaker 1>petite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curvy woman and that might be who I'd </v>

1244
00:57:25.751 --> 00:57:26.584
<v Speaker 1>rather cuddle with and date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the other one I just want to </v>

1245
00:57:30.661 --> 00:57:33.190
<v Speaker 1>have animal sex with and so there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1246
00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:34.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of pulled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1247
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to being a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker.</v>

1248
00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Why you making this sound like it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big complicated issue.</v>

1249
00:57:37.841 --> 00:57:38.674
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying I have to say maybe I </v>

1250
00:57:40.281 --> 00:57:42.060
<v Speaker 1>just like all different kinds of went </v>
<v Speaker 1>over you.</v>

1251
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:46.990
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like my shakes in white chicks.</v>

1252
00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

1253
00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:51.220
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is I'm attracted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

1254
00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:52.323
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the problem with being a </v>

1255
00:57:53.951 --> 00:57:54.784
<v Speaker 1>man is a genetically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're designed to spread them jeans </v>

1256
00:57:58.091 --> 00:58:00.940
<v Speaker 1>around as much as possible to ensure the</v>
<v Speaker 1>survival of the race.</v>

1257
00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:03.610
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not really necessary anymore.</v>

1258
00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Like we used to die really young.</v>

1259
00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:06.933
<v Speaker 1>We were eaten by things left and right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have this fucking insatiable </v>

1260
00:58:09.611 --> 00:58:12.370
<v Speaker 1>instinct to fuck all the time and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>rid of loads and make people,</v>

1261
00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:13.653
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of us now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we figured it out somewhere along </v>

1262
00:58:16.301 --> 00:58:17.134
<v Speaker 1>the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we still have the genes of people </v>

1263
00:58:18.401 --> 00:58:21.520
<v Speaker 1>that live 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago when your survival,</v>

1264
00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:22.713
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't guaranteed at all and it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely that something would go </v>

1265
00:58:26.591 --> 00:58:30.490
<v Speaker 1>wrong and so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the likelihood of you staying alive past</v>

1266
00:58:30.491 --> 00:58:31.324
<v Speaker 1>30 or 40 was very low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there was like a frantic urge to </v>

1267
00:58:34.691 --> 00:58:35.524
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1268
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:36.543
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if we knew that we had way less </v>

1269
00:58:38.261 --> 00:58:41.490
<v Speaker 1>time and that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the death was way more common.</v>

1270
00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:43.240
<v Speaker 1>If we start 10 year olds will be walking</v>
<v Speaker 1>on pregnant.</v>

1271
00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's how it is normally.</v>

1272
00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:46.143
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we decided some someone roll on </v>

1273
00:58:47.351 --> 00:58:48.850
<v Speaker 1>the lawn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rightly so.</v>

1274
00:58:48.970 --> 00:58:52.180
<v Speaker 1>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not healthy for our species.</v>

1275
00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:53.163
<v Speaker 1>It's not healthy for our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not healthy for children to be </v>

1276
00:58:55.571 --> 00:58:58.330
<v Speaker 1>burdened down by the responsibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a parent.</v>

1277
00:58:58.331 --> 00:58:59.164
<v Speaker 1>While they're still trying to figure it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out and they'd probably do a way better </v>

1278
00:59:01.001 --> 00:59:01.834
<v Speaker 1>job if they waited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all that stuff is sort of balancing </v>

1279
00:59:03.971 --> 00:59:07.240
<v Speaker 1>itself out now because people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming more and more aware of it,</v>

1280
00:59:07.241 --> 00:59:08.270
<v Speaker 1>so we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're still.</v>

1281
00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:12.340
<v Speaker 1>We still have the same genes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the same fucking caveman genes.</v>

1282
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:16.510
<v Speaker 1>The genetics have to be like constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed by the psyche,</v>

1283
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:20.740
<v Speaker 1>constantly managed by discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly managed by thinking,</v>

1284
00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:21.853
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's yelling at somebody in </v>

1285
00:59:22.851 --> 00:59:23.684
<v Speaker 1>traffic or whether it's all the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous male instincts that people </v>

1286
00:59:27.741 --> 00:59:28.574
<v Speaker 1>have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a star wars or to kick </v>

1287
00:59:31.041 --> 00:59:35.240
<v Speaker 1>their ass because they're rooting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong team and all that stuff is.</v>

1288
00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.133
<v Speaker 1>It's based on like these ancient reward </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that we've got stuck in our </v>

1289
00:59:40.281 --> 00:59:41.740
<v Speaker 1>pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like excitement.</v>

1290
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:42.583
<v Speaker 1>It can be really weird things secretly </v>
<v Speaker 1>for excitement and ideas to get charged </v>

1291
00:59:46.431 --> 00:59:46.911
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1292
00:59:46.911 --> 00:59:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Being not as good word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a naughty bus.</v>

1293
00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:52.910
<v Speaker 1>The naughty list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pernod is huge because my friend,</v>

1294

<v Speaker 1>this giant woman giant a big Oh my God.</v>

1295

<v Speaker 1>Three hundred pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gabby Garcia big.</v>

1300
01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Jaimee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was every bit of six foot five.</v>

1301
01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:13.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exaggerating with her shoes off.</v>

1302
01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:14.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1303
01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1304
01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:16.993
<v Speaker 1>I think you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're asking more detailed with this </v>

1305
01:00:18.141 --> 01:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>story that everyone thinks she can beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>your ass.</v>

1306
01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.100
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she could eat me as a whole.</v>

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never had to fight for your life.</v>

1308
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:24.763
<v Speaker 1>If you were in a hotel ballroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got locked in there with her and </v>

1309
01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:28.160
<v Speaker 1>she's coming full clip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has.</v>

1310
01:00:28.161 --> 01:00:30.230
<v Speaker 1>This is for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had no training.</v>

1311
01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I could tie her out,</v>

1312
01:00:32.121 --> 01:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>but I'd have no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is probably not.</v>

1313
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck her up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>there is a giant.</v>

<v Speaker 1>door.</v>

1336
01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:33.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an antelope or some,</v>

1337
01:01:33.261 --> 01:01:34.094
<v Speaker 1>some animal in Africa that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hermaphrodite knew it was a female </v>

1338
01:01:38.721 --> 01:01:39.554
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antelope with crazy horns like these </v>

1339
01:01:42.261 --> 01:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>crazy antlers that like curved in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird way.</v>

1340
01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:48.830
<v Speaker 1>We're actually digging into its head who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was actually a call animal.</v>

1341
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.120
<v Speaker 1>They had to put it down because it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way its horn was growing.</v>

1342
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:55.910
<v Speaker 1>It was like literally growing into its </v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

1343
01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was comfortable.</v>

1344
01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:01.730
<v Speaker 1>It was a very weird case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they also,</v>

1345
01:02:01.731 --> 01:02:02.564
<v Speaker 1>I guess they wanted to study its body </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were pretty sure it was a </v>

1346
01:02:04.391 --> 01:02:06.290
<v Speaker 1>hermaphrodite wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1347
01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.330
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1348
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>all those genetic aberrations happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1349
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to this woman from South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa recently at this party.</v>

1350
01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>I told you the story about all the kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>

1351
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>or</v>

1352
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.740
<v Speaker 4>she grew up in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She lives in South Africa for awhile and</v>

1353
01:02:22.741 --> 01:02:26.670
<v Speaker 4>it's really funny because she was </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about mountain lions and now how</v>

1354
01:02:26.671 --> 01:02:27.504
<v Speaker 4>hilarious it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The people are worried about mountain </v>

1355
01:02:28.741 --> 01:02:32.690
<v Speaker 4>lions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We would have to worry about that.</v>

1356
01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:36.780
<v Speaker 4>Rely on water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Buffalo snakes,</v>

1357
01:02:36.810 --> 01:02:38.790
<v Speaker 4>all the above.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All of the above.</v>

1358
01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:40.713
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she was talking about a kids in </v>

1359
01:02:42.781 --> 01:02:47.781
<v Speaker 4>silicone valley that are having problems</v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with their,</v>

1360
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.333
<v Speaker 4>they're hyper successful parents and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>lack of time and attention that's being </v>

1361
01:02:53.491 --> 01:02:58.260
<v Speaker 4>paid to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's like a gigantic epidemic,</v>

1362
01:02:58.290 --> 01:03:01.740
<v Speaker 4>suicides and all kinds of crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're cutting each other.</v>

1363
01:03:01.741 --> 01:03:03.990
<v Speaker 4>And it was a really disturbing </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation.</v>

1364
01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.060
<v Speaker 4>And she called it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they call,</v>

1365
01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:07.620
<v Speaker 4>what they call it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Affluenza.</v>

1366
01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:10.470
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the term for young rich kids.</v>

1367
01:03:10.471 --> 01:03:13.560
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is like nobody cared,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they didn't ask to be rich,</v>

1368
01:03:13.561 --> 01:03:15.090
<v Speaker 4>but we blame them for being rich.</v>

1369
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:18.690
<v Speaker 4>So like you don't look at a young rich </v>
<v Speaker 4>kid as like a young kid with problems.</v>

1370
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:19.321
<v Speaker 4>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>poor rich baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1372
01:03:21.061 --> 01:03:25.830
<v Speaker 4>like that somehow now that the money </v>
<v Speaker 4>that these kids have when they're 16,</v>

1373
01:03:25.831 --> 01:03:29.130
<v Speaker 4>they have a fucking fresh BMW.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The money that money provides connection</v>

1374
01:03:29.131 --> 01:03:30.360
<v Speaker 4>and love and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1375
01:03:30.361 --> 01:03:34.230
<v Speaker 4>and that you mean something to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>parents because it's so unattainable for</v>

1376
01:03:34.231 --> 01:03:35.064
<v Speaker 4>so many folks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Money and being rich like one of these </v>

1377
01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:40.710
<v Speaker 4>kids seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well they hit the lottery.</v>

1378
01:03:40.711 --> 01:03:41.544
<v Speaker 4>I'm supposed to feel bad for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you don't realize that like they </v>

1379
01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:45.680
<v Speaker 4>didn't ask for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1380
01:03:45.681 --> 01:03:47.880
<v Speaker 4>they didn't ask to be born that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's not ideal.</v>

1381
01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:48.863
<v Speaker 4>It's not working out well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd be way better off with a happy </v>

1382
01:03:52.141 --> 01:03:52.974
<v Speaker 4>healthy parents that were around and </v>
<v Speaker 4>went to your sports events and hung out </v>

1383
01:03:56.251 --> 01:04:01.170
<v Speaker 4>with Ya and did things with you and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and were there all the time and gave you</v>

1384
01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:03.150
<v Speaker 4>a feeling of comfort while you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>growing up.</v>

1385
01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:05.130
<v Speaker 4>So you can grow up with like a sense of </v>
<v Speaker 4>security,</v>

1386
01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.020
<v Speaker 4>like there's a lot of these kids that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are grown up,</v>

1387
01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:10.830
<v Speaker 4>they are all fucked up because their </v>
<v Speaker 4>parents are never around.</v>

1388
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:11.843
<v Speaker 4>So you don't feel like you matter or you</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't feel in many ways you feel like </v>

1389
01:04:14.701 --> 01:04:18.540
<v Speaker 4>you were thrown away and rampant drug </v>
<v Speaker 4>abuse,</v>

1390
01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:19.374
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The amount of kids that are doing pain </v>

1391
01:04:21.481 --> 01:04:24.750
<v Speaker 4>pills today as apparently just off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>charts,</v>

1392
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:25.823
<v Speaker 4>they're doing adderall for studying and </v>
<v Speaker 4>for for examinations and they're doing </v>

1393
01:04:29.911 --> 01:04:30.744
<v Speaker 4>pain pills all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just become an epidemic with </v>

1394
01:04:34.141 --> 01:04:36.290
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're so fucking easy to get.</v>

1395
01:04:36.310 --> 01:04:39.820
<v Speaker 4>I know they're trying to curb that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to make it more difficult to get,</v>

1396
01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:40.673
<v Speaker 4>but there's still a ton of money that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>being pumped into the system from the </v>

1397
01:04:43.651 --> 01:04:46.290
<v Speaker 4>manufacturers of these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you were talking about before,</v>

1398
01:04:46.291 --> 01:04:48.960
<v Speaker 4>about the use of influence and in </v>
<v Speaker 4>politics.</v>

1399
01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:52.600
<v Speaker 4>The company that makes fentanyl is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>I said I never figured that out.</v>

1400
01:04:52.601 --> 01:04:53.434
<v Speaker 4>So fentanyl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they spent a half of a fucking million </v>

1401
01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:02.100
<v Speaker 4>dollars on ads in Arizona just to try to</v>
<v Speaker 4>make medical marijuana illegal.</v>

1402
01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:07.080
<v Speaker 4>Try to make it to to to do ads against </v>
<v Speaker 4>them in their recreational,</v>

1403
01:05:07.081 --> 01:05:09.210
<v Speaker 4>like why would they give a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are they doing that?</v>

1404
01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.073
<v Speaker 4>Like why would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would the makers of a pill like </v>

1405
01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:13.373
<v Speaker 4>Google that too?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's another thing I keep </v>

1406
01:05:14.191 --> 01:05:15.024
<v Speaker 4>wondering about how much stronger is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that shit that oxycontin because it's </v>

1407
01:05:17.741 --> 01:05:18.160
<v Speaker 4>much</v>

1408
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.770
<v Speaker 1>stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thought it was an elephant tranquilizer.</v>

1409
01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>I maybe I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that what they were putting</v>

1410
01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:25.010
<v Speaker 1>in the heroin and everybody was dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1411
01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>They that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think is an elephant.</v>

1412
01:05:26.831 --> 01:05:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Tranquilizer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fentanyl,</v>

1413
01:05:29.890 --> 01:05:30.723
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's an elephant </v>

1414
01:05:31.961 --> 01:05:34.120
<v Speaker 1>tranquilizer they use on the elephants </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people,</v>

1415
01:05:34.121 --> 01:05:34.954
<v Speaker 1>but they definitely use it on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was something to be stronger right </v>

1416
01:05:38.591 --> 01:05:39.180
<v Speaker 1>then then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

1417
01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:40.900
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I don't know.</v>

1418
01:05:40.901 --> 01:05:44.050
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to find that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at least I remember the number.</v>

1419
01:05:44.051 --> 01:05:44.884
<v Speaker 1>10</v>

1420
01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:50.220
<v Speaker 5>inverse.com.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It looks like an okay story written on.</v>

1421
01:05:50.221 --> 01:05:52.830
<v Speaker 5>It says it's 80 times as potent as </v>
<v Speaker 5>morphine.</v>

1422
01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:53.820
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1423
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:58.680
<v Speaker 5>Which is 80 times of times the animal </v>
<v Speaker 5>analgesic punch of heroin.</v>

1424
01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus said,</v>

1425
01:06:01.311 --> 01:06:03.050
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be good.</v>

1426
01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:03.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1427
01:06:03.711 --> 01:06:08.711
<v Speaker 1>this is what people are dropping dead </v>
<v Speaker 1>off and the company that makes that shit</v>

1428
01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:11.143
<v Speaker 1>is trying to put out ads or pay for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign against marijuana being </v>

1429
01:06:17.781 --> 01:06:20.480
<v Speaker 1>recreationally legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just fucking crazy.</v>

1430
01:06:20.900 --> 01:06:22.550
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1431
01:06:22.551 --> 01:06:23.384
<v Speaker 1>I know that they think that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to lose profit from marijuana </v>

1432
01:06:24.951 --> 01:06:25.784
<v Speaker 1>being legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I know that they're acting out of a </v>

1433
01:06:26.871 --> 01:06:29.540
<v Speaker 1>business purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that's just what businesses do,</v>

1434
01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:30.613
<v Speaker 1>but you just expect them on something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so fucking important culturally </v>

1435
01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:37.430
<v Speaker 1>and such an important precedent like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1436
01:06:37.431 --> 01:06:40.640
<v Speaker 1>Any company that's against marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming legal,</v>

1437
01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:45.700
<v Speaker 1>that is such a damaging position to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you get away with it today,</v>

1438
01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:50.800
<v Speaker 1>by the time people examine this and by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time it's looked back on five,</v>

1439
01:06:50.830 --> 01:06:52.310
<v Speaker 1>10 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

1440
01:06:52.311 --> 01:06:53.144
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna look preposterous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you spent any money to try to make </v>

1441
01:06:56.721 --> 01:06:58.930
<v Speaker 1>marijuana illegal reason.</v>

1442
01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I think no reason why anyone should step</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and try to make it illegal.</v>

1443
01:07:05.241 --> 01:07:06.074
<v Speaker 1>It's the will of the people and there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>no medical evidence whatsoever that </v>

1444
01:07:09.531 --> 01:07:10.364
<v Speaker 1>shows that it's even remotely as </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous as a million different things </v>

1445
01:07:13.281 --> 01:07:14.360
<v Speaker 1>that are already illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

1446
01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.650
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another,</v>

1447
01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:18.980
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of another example of what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking about before,</v>

1448
01:07:18.981 --> 01:07:19.814
<v Speaker 1>which is that you can try to legislate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pass laws and enforce sort of your </v>

1449
01:07:24.651 --> 01:07:28.520
<v Speaker 1>view of reality of World War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you think is good for people,</v>

1450
01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:32.300
<v Speaker 1>but what's it seems to me a better way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go is to win the idea,</v>

1451
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:36.350
<v Speaker 1>what do the idea that marijuana is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>as destructive.</v>

1452
01:07:36.351 --> 01:07:39.140
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many ways I'm not an expert,</v>

1453
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:41.930
<v Speaker 1>but in many ways to say alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is legal.</v>

1454
01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just.</v>

1455
01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.330
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to say I'm not an </v>
<v Speaker 1>expert.</v>

1456
01:07:44.430 --> 01:07:48.320
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely scientifically proven </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>

1457
01:07:48.321 --> 01:07:49.154
<v Speaker 1>but that act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that took time to not only be sort </v>

1458
01:07:52.521 --> 01:07:53.354
<v Speaker 1>of enough experiment just in real life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and real time started to prove that to </v>

1459
01:07:58.821 --> 01:07:59.654
<v Speaker 1>be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then that idea and that experience </v>

1460
01:08:01.501 --> 01:08:06.480
<v Speaker 1>had to dissipate into the national or </v>
<v Speaker 1>international collective conscious.</v>

1461
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:08.150
<v Speaker 1>Part of that was because of Richard </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nixon,</v>

1462
01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Richard Nixon funded study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put studies together to try to find</v>

1463
01:08:12.681 --> 01:08:14.420
<v Speaker 1>out what are the bad things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>

1464
01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't find anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1465
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:18.770
<v Speaker 4>This is way before that when reefer </v>
<v Speaker 4>madness was in 19 thirties,</v>

1466
01:08:19.020 --> 01:08:19.853
<v Speaker 4>the the shit that Nixon did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nixon pass a sweeping set psychedelic </v>

1467
01:08:22.911 --> 01:08:25.100
<v Speaker 4>act of 1970.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That made everything scheduled.</v>

1468
01:08:25.101 --> 01:08:28.550
<v Speaker 4>One those dmt and mushrooms and all that</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit and that Nixon did and yeah,</v>

1469
01:08:28.551 --> 01:08:30.530
<v Speaker 4>it was during his administration and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they also.</v>

1470
01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:31.693
<v Speaker 4>One of the things they did was they did </v>
<v Speaker 4>these studies on marijuana trying to </v>

1471
01:08:33.921 --> 01:08:36.170
<v Speaker 4>find things that were bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't,</v>

1472
01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.080
<v Speaker 4>and when the studies came up with </v>
<v Speaker 4>favorable results,</v>

1473
01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:41.180
<v Speaker 4>they buried them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is also been proven,</v>

1474
01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:45.110
<v Speaker 4>so this is shit they knew for a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking time.</v>

1475
01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.710
<v Speaker 4>It's just a team thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going back to that same thing again</v>

1476
01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.630
<v Speaker 4>is pro and con.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

1477
01:08:50.890 --> 01:08:51.501
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1478
01:08:51.501 --> 01:08:54.620
<v Speaker 4>right and left and even along this </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana thing,</v>

1479
01:08:54.621 --> 01:08:55.454
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>scrambling to try to keep it illegal as </v>

1480
01:08:57.951 --> 01:08:58.790
<v Speaker 4>long as possible.</v>

1481
01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:01.730
<v Speaker 4>So that continues their profits with </v>
<v Speaker 4>painkillers.</v>

1482
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:05.600
<v Speaker 4>Painkillers are worried that if </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana becomes legal,</v>

1483
01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.940
<v Speaker 4>if marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially edible marijuana,</v>

1484
01:09:07.941 --> 01:09:11.600
<v Speaker 4>which is incredibly potent but doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>have any of the fucking downsides,</v>

1485
01:09:11.730 --> 01:09:13.610
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have any of the negative </v>
<v Speaker 4>effects.</v>

1486
01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:16.280
<v Speaker 4>No one's dying from it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the biggest one,</v>

1487
01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.133
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's been shown to help so many </v>

1488
01:09:18.261 --> 01:09:21.290
<v Speaker 4>people with seizures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so many different diseases.</v>

1489
01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:22.153
<v Speaker 4>People that have aids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are on chemotherapy is </v>

1490
01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:27.590
<v Speaker 4>hundreds and hundreds of different </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that it's been shown to help with</v>

1491
01:09:27.591 --> 01:09:28.530
<v Speaker 4>people with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1492
01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:30.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>

1493
01:09:30.971 --> 01:09:33.590
<v Speaker 4>I'm glaucoma.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that for the ocular pressure,</v>

1494
01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:34.493
<v Speaker 4>international ocular pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>relieved that it's amazing for </v>

1495
01:09:36.951 --> 01:09:37.784
<v Speaker 4>inflammation for people that have back </v>
<v Speaker 4>problems and all sorts of other issues </v>

1496
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.170
<v Speaker 4>regarding pain and inflammatory issues </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people have,</v>

1497
01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.053
<v Speaker 4>but these are the things that would </v>
<v Speaker 4>profit from keeping it illegal are the </v>

1498
01:09:53.961 --> 01:09:57.890
<v Speaker 4>same things to killing people and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that they're allowed to do that and</v>

1499
01:09:57.891 --> 01:10:00.950
<v Speaker 4>that no one steps in and no politicians </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk about it being huge,</v>

1500
01:10:00.951 --> 01:10:02.510
<v Speaker 4>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a real problem.</v>

1501
01:10:02.690 --> 01:10:04.970
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the things that's left </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely off the debate.</v>

1502
01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.073
<v Speaker 4>It's not to diminish sexual assault </v>
<v Speaker 4>because obviously that's really </v>

1503
01:10:08.001 --> 01:10:09.620
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not to diminish primary,</v>

1504
01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:10.693
<v Speaker 4>obviously that's really important and </v>
<v Speaker 4>those pay to play stuff and all these </v>

1505
01:10:12.681 --> 01:10:16.130
<v Speaker 4>accusations of corruption on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all very important,</v>

1506
01:10:16.131 --> 01:10:19.460
<v Speaker 4>but man sows that love.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is.</v>

1507
01:10:19.461 --> 01:10:22.880
<v Speaker 4>And also learning how to distinguish and</v>
<v Speaker 4>learning,</v>

1508
01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:26.990
<v Speaker 4>learning how to distinguish what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>should label,</v>

1509
01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:29.410
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a psychedelic or.</v>

1510
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:29.811
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

1511
01:10:29.811 --> 01:10:30.650
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just that,</v>

1512
01:10:30.651 --> 01:10:35.651
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes I wonder if if when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>call for the legalization of marijuana,</v>

1513
01:10:37.401 --> 01:10:38.540
<v Speaker 4>which I would do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

1514
01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:43.010
<v Speaker 4>and I've always said that ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's all about letting people make their</v>

1515
01:10:43.011 --> 01:10:43.844
<v Speaker 4>own choices,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I wonder if it's important to </v>

1516
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:50.240
<v Speaker 4>distinguish between drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like do you think that it certainly is.</v>

1517
01:10:50.241 --> 01:10:55.241
<v Speaker 4>Heroin and cocaine should also be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think as an adult,</v>

1518
01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:59.240
<v Speaker 4>as you Brian Callen the idea that me as </v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

1519
01:10:59.241 --> 01:11:03.620
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan could tell you you can't do </v>
<v Speaker 4>heroin is preposterous.</v>

1520
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:06.080
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck am I?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who am I to tell you?</v>

1521
01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:07.033
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can do it under a doctor's </v>

1522
01:11:07.341 --> 01:11:10.000
<v Speaker 4>supervision or you could do morphine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gonna have to have a morphine drip.</v>

1523
01:11:10.050 --> 01:11:10.980
<v Speaker 4>You have a button.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're pressing.</v>

1524
01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.160
<v Speaker 4>The morphine goes into your bloodstream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

1525
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All</v>

1526
01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:14.933
<v Speaker 1>I know is a lot of fucking people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>dying from pain pills and politicians </v>

1527
01:11:18.121 --> 01:11:20.700
<v Speaker 1>never discuss it and why don't they talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1528
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.863
<v Speaker 1>Just stop and think about is is is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>big issue of one super rich guy who was </v>

1529
01:11:25.591 --> 01:11:26.424
<v Speaker 1>a pussy grabber or is the big issue half</v>
<v Speaker 1>a million people dying from cigarettes </v>

1530
01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:34.830
<v Speaker 1>in this country alone every year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that an issue?</v>

1531
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:38.460
<v Speaker 1>How come at issues and discuss if there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was something else that was killing half</v>

1532
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:39.750
<v Speaker 1>a million people a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't we freak out?</v>

1533
01:11:39.751 --> 01:11:40.331
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100.</v>

1534
01:11:40.331 --> 01:11:42.030
<v Speaker 1>If there was some new sport would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>parked.</v>

1535
01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:42.864
<v Speaker 1>Core was claiming a half a million kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>every year saying that are saying the </v>

1536
01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:46.973
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more challenging issues than a guy who </v>

1537
01:11:49.741 --> 01:11:52.450
<v Speaker 1>is a groper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine roper.</v>

1538
01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:53.363
<v Speaker 1>I think it's terrible to be a groper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's certainly something that </v>

1539
01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:57.390
<v Speaker 1>should be discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the problem.</v>

1540
01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.370
<v Speaker 1>The problem is they're not discussing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this other thing.</v>

1541
01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.233
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not discussing how many fucking </v>

1542
01:12:00.961 --> 01:12:03.690
<v Speaker 1>people are hooked on painkillers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's giant,</v>

1543
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.823
<v Speaker 1>massive epidemic and the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same people that are selling those </v>

1544
01:12:07.681 --> 01:12:11.340
<v Speaker 1>painkillers are actively working to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that marijuana stays illegal.</v>

1545
01:12:11.341 --> 01:12:12.174
<v Speaker 1>He lets you know that you're in a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>system when the protectors and the </v>

1546
01:12:15.001 --> 01:12:19.410
<v Speaker 1>politicians don't bring that up at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>because who's driving the narrative?</v>

1547
01:12:19.440 --> 01:12:20.273
<v Speaker 1>Think about who's driving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about drive and then the people </v>

1548
01:12:22.981 --> 01:12:25.030
<v Speaker 1>who are driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving the narrative in the,</v>

1549
01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:26.220
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lip,</v>

1550
01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.950
<v Speaker 1>in the New York liberal media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1551
01:12:29.490 --> 01:12:33.420
<v Speaker 1>That is why is it academics were </v>
<v Speaker 1>academics and why is academia?</v>

1552
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Why is that driving the narrative on </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything from gender to even social?</v>

1553
01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:39.423
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1554
01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:42.210
<v Speaker 1>Because we don't live in the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We assume they're the smarter ones,</v>

1555
01:12:42.211 --> 01:12:43.044
<v Speaker 1>but they're they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have theoretical knowledge and I </v>

1556
01:12:45.181 --> 01:12:46.014
<v Speaker 1>think there's a place for academics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's an obvious place for a </v>

1557
01:12:48.901 --> 01:12:52.590
<v Speaker 1>strong intellectual energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my God,</v>

1558
01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:53.220
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing.</v>

1559
01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:56.910
<v Speaker 1>There's no group more intolerant to new </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas in many ways.</v>

1560
01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I would say religious people were far </v>
<v Speaker 1>more intolerant than academics.</v>

1561
01:13:01.561 --> 01:13:04.530
<v Speaker 1>I would think that academics on a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>would probably be very tonal pens.</v>

1562
01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.560
<v Speaker 1>They just lean left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just leaned left almost,</v>

1563
01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:10.010
<v Speaker 1>almost exclusively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except when it comes to like economic.</v>

1564
01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:10.923
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're tolerant at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they suffer from collective </v>

1565
01:13:14.311 --> 01:13:15.570
<v Speaker 1>madness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact.</v>

1566
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gender mania,</v>

1567
01:13:17.250 --> 01:13:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at,</v>

1568
01:13:17.850 --> 01:13:18.810
<v Speaker 1>look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

1569
01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Let's take trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually resent the fact that first of</v>

1570
01:13:23.011 --> 01:13:23.844
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I've never been a fan of this </v>

1571
01:13:25.621 --> 01:13:26.454
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I resent the fact that people seem </v>

1572
01:13:28.141 --> 01:13:28.974
<v Speaker 1>to be equating equating a groping and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even even a kissing somebody or talking </v>

1573
01:13:38.761 --> 01:13:43.761
<v Speaker 1>about it as rape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual assault to a woman,</v>

1574
01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:47.113
<v Speaker 1>a woman who doesn't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he comes up and grabs you on the </v>

1575
01:13:48.931 --> 01:13:51.570
<v Speaker 1>poster is sexual assault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would agree with that,</v>

1576
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:54.390
<v Speaker 1>but that is one of the accusations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1577
01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:55.523
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to distinguish between what is </v>

1578
01:13:57.991 --> 01:14:01.950
<v Speaker 1>that sexual misconduct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it sexual assault?</v>

1579
01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.170
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the girl loves it.</v>

1580
01:14:04.590 --> 01:14:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Then it's neither like if she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she pulls her panties to the side and</v>

1581
01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.610
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh daddy goes down it and like you found</v>

1582
01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:12.180
<v Speaker 1>a freak,</v>

1583
01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:12.881
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1584
01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:15.880
<v Speaker 4>but he took a big fucking chance where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you just grab the pussy.</v>

1585
01:14:15.970 --> 01:14:17.470
<v Speaker 4>She probably asked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you're an asshole.</v>

1586
01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:18.700
<v Speaker 4>She probably just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1587
01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:19.950
<v Speaker 4>you're thinking about grabbing your </v>
<v Speaker 4>posts.</v>

1588
01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:20.880
<v Speaker 4>You're here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think?</v>

1589
01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:22.960
<v Speaker 4>Want to think about it for awhile?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be out here waiting.</v>

1590
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:25.240
<v Speaker 4>You've got to give her time to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And not under pressure.</v>

1591
01:14:25.241 --> 01:14:27.040
<v Speaker 4>You don't want be looming over was a big</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

1592
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:29.200
<v Speaker 4>So he asked the Lord lawyer show.</v>

1593
01:14:30.570 --> 01:14:31.403
<v Speaker 3>I think these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are really important distinctions </v>

1594
01:14:32.791 --> 01:14:35.730
<v Speaker 3>because otherwise people that are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman who's held down.</v>

1595
01:14:35.731 --> 01:14:37.740
<v Speaker 3>Let's just take a terrible example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a woman,</v>

1596
01:14:37.770 --> 01:14:38.930
<v Speaker 3>a stranger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>breaks into your house,</v>

1597
01:14:38.931 --> 01:14:40.580
<v Speaker 3>holds you down and rapes her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1598
01:14:40.770 --> 01:14:44.160
<v Speaker 3>We would all agree that that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is fucking horrifying,</v>

1599
01:14:44.161 --> 01:14:44.994
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you've found the guy be hard not </v>

1600
01:14:46.261 --> 01:14:48.030
<v Speaker 3>to kill the guy and all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1601
01:14:48.031 --> 01:14:50.280
<v Speaker 3>but let's make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's make a distinction.</v>

1602
01:14:50.281 --> 01:14:51.180
<v Speaker 3>Ready?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ready?</v>

1603
01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:54.600
<v Speaker 3>A big bully.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A guy like trump comes up,</v>

1604
01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:55.790
<v Speaker 3>grabs you and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1605
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:58.850
<v Speaker 3>and puts his fingers in your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty.</v>

1606
01:14:58.890 --> 01:15:00.180
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty invasive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So hot.</v>

1607
01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:01.103
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking evasive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're and you work for the guy and </v>

1608
01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:07.440
<v Speaker 3>you're scared to lose your job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he grabs you and he puts his finger,</v>

1609
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:08.460
<v Speaker 3>came out and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on baby.</v>

1610
01:15:08.461 --> 01:15:09.294
<v Speaker 3>Give me a kiss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because you're so afraid and so </v>

1611
01:15:11.281 --> 01:15:13.170
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what to do,</v>

1612
01:15:13.171 --> 01:15:14.310
<v Speaker 3>and he starts kissing you and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1613
01:15:14.311 --> 01:15:15.660
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let this be over with.</v>

1614
01:15:15.690 --> 01:15:18.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that's happened 1 million times</v>
<v Speaker 3>in life with women.</v>

1615
01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.700
<v Speaker 3>And this is why women when they see that</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

1616
01:15:20.701 --> 01:15:21.960
<v Speaker 3>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met a guy like that.</v>

1617
01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:25.140
<v Speaker 3>I've been 10 guys like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why the reaction for women is</v>

1618
01:15:25.141 --> 01:15:26.160
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck this guy.</v>

1619
01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:29.010
<v Speaker 3>He's going to fall by 14 points.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

1620
01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:33.870
<v Speaker 3>let's as as citizens and in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>discussion in the law,</v>

1621
01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:36.240
<v Speaker 3>you have to make a distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the media,</v>

1622
01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:37.253
<v Speaker 3>because if you start calling that rape </v>
<v Speaker 3>or if you start calling that sexual </v>

1623
01:15:40.801 --> 01:15:41.850
<v Speaker 3>assault versus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1624
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:43.870
<v Speaker 3>sexual misconduct or I don't know.</v>

1625
01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:45.110
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hold on a second.</v>

1626
01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:48.830
<v Speaker 4>If somebody grabs you and kisses you and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want them to do that,</v>

1627
01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:52.340
<v Speaker 4>it means that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is a form of assault.</v>

1628
01:15:52.570 --> 01:15:57.570
<v Speaker 4>Not Assault punching you in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it should be illegal to hold you and</v>

1629
01:15:58.311 --> 01:16:01.880
<v Speaker 4>detain you and like and forced a kiss on</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

1630
01:16:01.881 --> 01:16:04.770
<v Speaker 4>Like you're violating that person's </v>
<v Speaker 4>physical space.</v>

1631
01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:05.923
<v Speaker 4>You're violating their humanity because </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're choosing to enforce your wants </v>

1632
01:16:08.961 --> 01:16:10.880
<v Speaker 4>and needs over what they want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Budget.</v>

1633
01:16:10.881 --> 01:16:13.610
<v Speaker 4>Would you equate this problem?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking,</v>

1634
01:16:13.611 --> 01:16:16.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know that there have been times in</v>

1635
01:16:16.281 --> 01:16:17.114
<v Speaker 4>people's lives when someone has grabbed </v>
<v Speaker 4>a woman and kissed her and she loved it </v>

1636
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:22.250
<v Speaker 4>and they want up getting married and </v>
<v Speaker 4>having kids.</v>

1637
01:16:22.251 --> 01:16:23.084
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You never fucking know who the hell </v>

1638
01:16:24.501 --> 01:16:27.590
<v Speaker 4>knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like no one wants sexual assault,</v>

1639
01:16:27.591 --> 01:16:28.424
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one wants anyone to have anything </v>

1640
01:16:29.781 --> 01:16:31.040
<v Speaker 4>done to them against their will.</v>

1641
01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:33.440
<v Speaker 4>No one does this rational or kind in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1642
01:16:33.441 --> 01:16:36.410
<v Speaker 4>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we all know there's crazy moments in</v>

1643
01:16:36.411 --> 01:16:37.100
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1644
01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:40.040
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's weird things happen with people.</v>

1645
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:42.290
<v Speaker 4>People had sex without saying a word to </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>

1646
01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.180
<v Speaker 4>Dan Bilzerian was just talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>other day.</v>

1647
01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:45.650
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He met some girl in Paris.</v>

1648
01:16:45.690 --> 01:16:47.990
<v Speaker 4>He purposely went out of his way to not </v>
<v Speaker 4>say a word,</v>

1649
01:16:47.991 --> 01:16:49.850
<v Speaker 4>see if he could do it and had sex with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>girl.</v>

1650
01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:51.433
<v Speaker 4>There's no consent there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just implied consent based on </v>

1651
01:16:53.571 --> 01:16:55.050
<v Speaker 4>physical movement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1652
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.491
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so.</v>

1653
01:16:55.491 --> 01:16:56.450
<v Speaker 4>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still,</v>

1654
01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:01.310
<v Speaker 4>but my point is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my point is do you shouldn't compare</v>

1655
01:17:01.370 --> 01:17:02.203
<v Speaker 4>worst versions of rape and say that this</v>
<v Speaker 4>version of what you would call sexual </v>

1656
01:17:06.921 --> 01:17:11.921
<v Speaker 4>assault is not that big of a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're kind of saying that by saying</v>

1657
01:17:12.201 --> 01:17:13.034
<v Speaker 4>that you're calling it why call,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're diminishing the horribleness </v>

1658
01:17:15.861 --> 01:17:16.694
<v Speaker 4>of the other people's experiences by </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually getting physically raped and </v>

1659
01:17:19.470 --> 01:17:20.303
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nights of their neck and getting </v>

1660
01:17:20.691 --> 01:17:21.524
<v Speaker 4>fucked by a book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there has to be a difference right </v>

1661
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:23.990
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1662
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.823
<v Speaker 4>Has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a difference that the physical </v>

1663
01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.740
<v Speaker 4>action is different in every single one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

1664
01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:30.593
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's different in a girl gets pulled </v>

1665
01:17:32.241 --> 01:17:35.840
<v Speaker 4>over and the cop makes her suck his dick</v>
<v Speaker 4>get out of a ticket.</v>

1666
01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:37.000
<v Speaker 4>People have done that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1667
01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.080
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a different thing than,</v>

1668
01:17:39.230 --> 01:17:40.063
<v Speaker 4>than uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>than a girl who grabs her a male </v>

1669
01:17:42.381 --> 01:17:44.030
<v Speaker 4>employees dick all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1670
01:17:44.031 --> 01:17:44.864
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's unwanted and he doesn't want to </v>

1671
01:17:45.951 --> 01:17:47.900
<v Speaker 4>lose his job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not as threatening.</v>

1672
01:17:47.901 --> 01:17:48.734
<v Speaker 4>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of different </v>

1673
01:17:49.311 --> 01:17:51.560
<v Speaker 4>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My point in her,</v>

1674
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:56.120
<v Speaker 4>like anyone who's been grabbed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean that I mean by by,</v>

1675
01:17:56.150 --> 01:17:59.060
<v Speaker 4>by saying that it's not as bad as </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting raped.</v>

1676
01:17:59.061 --> 01:18:00.110
<v Speaker 4>That's like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1677
01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:02.150
<v Speaker 4>of course it's not as bad as gang raped </v>
<v Speaker 4>and murdered.</v>

1678
01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:03.223
<v Speaker 4>It's not as bad as getting raped and </v>
<v Speaker 4>murdered and they make you eat yourself </v>

1679
01:18:05.631 --> 01:18:09.330
<v Speaker 4>before they kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going worse and worse and worse</v>

1680
01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.470
<v Speaker 3>saying is that I feel there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement,</v>

1681
01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:16.690
<v Speaker 3>a movement to have to treat all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>perpetrators of that kind of behavior as</v>

1682
01:18:17.171 --> 01:18:19.420
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's what standards.</v>

1683
01:18:19.421 --> 01:18:22.450
<v Speaker 3>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a guy who meets a girl.</v>

1684
01:18:22.451 --> 01:18:23.960
<v Speaker 3>She does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1685
01:18:24.090 --> 01:18:26.270
<v Speaker 3>she drinks 15 Margarita's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1686
01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:28.300
<v Speaker 3>you guys making out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're dancing.</v>

1687
01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:29.740
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

1688
01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:31.570
<v Speaker 3>he follows her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what happens.</v>

1689
01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:32.850
<v Speaker 3>Next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody sees her.</v>

1690
01:18:32.851 --> 01:18:33.684
<v Speaker 3>He's on top of her making out with her </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's fingering her and she was out </v>

1691
01:18:36.071 --> 01:18:37.260
<v Speaker 3>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's cold,</v>

1692
01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:38.530
<v Speaker 3>she's holding the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on,</v>

1693
01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.330
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1694
01:18:40.331 --> 01:18:42.940
<v Speaker 3>We now in California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not considered rape.</v>

1695
01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:45.310
<v Speaker 3>Somebody had to sit down and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's rape?</v>

1696
01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:47.170
<v Speaker 3>Let's define it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fingers in the mouth,</v>

1697
01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.060
<v Speaker 3>fingers in the vagina or penis in </v>
<v Speaker 3>vagina.</v>

1698
01:18:49.061 --> 01:18:52.270
<v Speaker 3>We got to make these definitions and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>law,</v>

1699
01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:54.940
<v Speaker 3>the law tends to make very strong </v>
<v Speaker 3>distinctions,</v>

1700
01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:55.793
<v Speaker 3>knows distinctions have been thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>about and fought over and stuff like </v>

1701
01:18:57.971 --> 01:18:58.804
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we,</v>

1702
01:18:58.930 --> 01:19:01.550
<v Speaker 3>we penalize people accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1703
01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:02.560
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1704
01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:05.650
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that in,</v>

1705
01:19:05.651 --> 01:19:08.380
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on certain colleges,</v>

1706
01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:11.530
<v Speaker 3>they now have investigative committee </v>
<v Speaker 3>committees,</v>

1707
01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:12.393
<v Speaker 3>investigative communities who decide </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not this was sexual assault </v>

1708
01:19:15.911 --> 01:19:16.744
<v Speaker 3>or whether or not this was rape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I think actually that should be </v>

1709
01:19:21.731 --> 01:19:24.130
<v Speaker 3>anytime there's sexual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1710
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:29.530
<v Speaker 3>assault or rape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't that be the police's job?</v>

1711
01:19:29.650 --> 01:19:31.960
<v Speaker 3>Shouldn't that be reported immediately </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the police?</v>

1712
01:19:31.961 --> 01:19:33.750
<v Speaker 3>And isn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't that</v>

1713
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:36.100
<v Speaker 4>or jurisdiction where there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>lawsuits based on the,</v>

1714
01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Occidental College one,</v>

1715
01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.333
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that one where a guy and a girl were </v>

1716
01:19:40.161 --> 01:19:41.930
<v Speaker 4>exchanging text messages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1717
01:19:42.290 --> 01:19:43.140
<v Speaker 4>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1718
01:19:43.141 --> 01:19:44.840
<v Speaker 4>you bring condoms?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

1719
01:19:44.841 --> 01:19:46.100
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got condoms.</v>

1720
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:47.990
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're ready to get laid.</v>

1721
01:19:47.991 --> 01:19:48.560
<v Speaker 4>She says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1722
01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:49.730
<v Speaker 4>she texts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>her friend says,</v>

1723
01:19:49.731 --> 01:19:52.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm about to get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have sex,</v>

1724
01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:55.550
<v Speaker 4>and he gets kicked out for sexual </v>
<v Speaker 4>assault because he's drunk.</v>

1725
01:19:55.551 --> 01:19:57.950
<v Speaker 4>And she's drunk so he gets kicked out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>school,</v>

1726
01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:01.250
<v Speaker 4>she stays in the school and he's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the perpetrator.</v>

1727
01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.113
<v Speaker 4>But meanwhile there's so much evidence </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're both just young kids who </v>

1728
01:20:04.881 --> 01:20:08.310
<v Speaker 4>got drunk and fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you go it into a life and his life</v>

1729
01:20:08.311 --> 01:20:09.144
<v Speaker 4>is ruined.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's.</v>

1730
01:20:09.210 --> 01:20:10.043
<v Speaker 4>He's suing the shit out of him and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>hope he gets enough money so I can live </v>

1731
01:20:12.151 --> 01:20:13.830
<v Speaker 4>in a Jay z video for the rest of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

1732
01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:15.330
<v Speaker 4>Fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1733
01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:16.173
<v Speaker 4>like look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every like any God damn person who has </v>

1734
01:20:18.331 --> 01:20:22.950
<v Speaker 4>ever been 18 or however old these people</v>
<v Speaker 4>were and been away from your parents for</v>

1735
01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:27.650
<v Speaker 4>the first time and been drunk and hooked</v>
<v Speaker 4>up with a girl like you,</v>

1736
01:20:27.651 --> 01:20:28.490
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know.</v>

1737
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.393
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing evil going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like two people that want to be </v>

1738
01:20:31.981 --> 01:20:35.160
<v Speaker 4>together to get together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like to call that rape in any way,</v>

1739
01:20:35.161 --> 01:20:36.810
<v Speaker 4>shape or form is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

1740
01:20:36.990 --> 01:20:37.640
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about,</v>

1741
01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.210
<v Speaker 4>how about this though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but see that,</v>

1742
01:20:39.211 --> 01:20:40.044
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's so different than pussy </v>

1743
01:20:41.191 --> 01:20:42.024
<v Speaker 4>grabbing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1744
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:44.940
<v Speaker 4>Pussy grabbing and pushing people up </v>
<v Speaker 4>against the wall and kissing him.</v>

1745
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:46.103
<v Speaker 4>That is way more a salty sea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's way more violation of your </v>

1746
01:20:49.081 --> 01:20:49.940
<v Speaker 4>physical space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gray.</v>

1747
01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:52.020
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if a big guy did that to me,</v>

1748
01:20:52.021 --> 01:20:53.840
<v Speaker 4>if a big guy just grabbed me and kissed </v>
<v Speaker 4>me and be like,</v>

1749
01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:55.380
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker,</v>

1750
01:20:55.381 --> 01:20:56.160
<v Speaker 4>what do I do?</v>

1751
01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't want this guy to kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1752
01:20:57.991 --> 01:21:01.260
<v Speaker 4>it's some giant seven foot tall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>350 pound dude wants to kiss you.</v>

1753
01:21:01.410 --> 01:21:02.243
<v Speaker 4>That's what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure a woman and a guy like trump </v>

1754
01:21:04.141 --> 01:21:04.951
<v Speaker 4>grabs you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

1755
01:21:04.951 --> 01:21:05.784
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a dude and you're into having </v>

1756
01:21:07.291 --> 01:21:10.500
<v Speaker 4>big dudes grab you and kiss you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you like fucking bonus.</v>

1757
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:11.783
<v Speaker 4>I nailed it today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm saying that if there is a </v>

1758
01:21:14.581 --> 01:21:16.740
<v Speaker 4>movement to again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the enemy is.</v>

1759
01:21:16.741 --> 01:21:21.741
<v Speaker 4>There's a movement to lump all behavior </v>
<v Speaker 4>under the same sort of dark.</v>

1760
01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:23.210
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there is,</v>

1761
01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:24.083
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a movement to make </v>

1762
01:21:24.721 --> 01:21:27.870
<v Speaker 4>people more aware of behavior like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>

1763
01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:30.360
<v Speaker 4>How about this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is where I think things get crazy.</v>

1764
01:21:30.570 --> 01:21:32.220
<v Speaker 4>A woman has sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she gets drunk,</v>

1765
01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:37.200
<v Speaker 4>she has sex with a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then she speaks to somebody who says</v>

1766
01:21:37.201 --> 01:21:37.800
<v Speaker 4>you were drunk.</v>

1767
01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.750
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and do you have regrets about it?</v>

1768
01:21:39.930 --> 01:21:41.220
<v Speaker 4>I have regrets about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1769
01:21:41.490 --> 01:21:44.730
<v Speaker 4>if you have regrets then that that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>rape.</v>

1770
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:45.833
<v Speaker 4>Now somebody says that to her and she </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes to a committee in her school who </v>

1771
01:21:49.621 --> 01:21:54.621
<v Speaker 4>does an investigation and now you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>being investigated because this girl has</v>

1772
01:21:54.871 --> 01:21:55.980
<v Speaker 4>regrets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Six months later,</v>

1773
01:21:57.210 --> 01:21:59.220
<v Speaker 4>this is where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

1774
01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:00.293
<v Speaker 4>madness starts to this very scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very scary because now you've got </v>

1775
01:22:04.610 --> 01:22:08.540
<v Speaker 4>have mob mentality over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all he's hearsay the guy.</v>

1776
01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:10.530
<v Speaker 4>The worst thing that can be branded as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>sex criminal.</v>

1777
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:11.423
<v Speaker 4>My God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I ruined your whole fucking life and </v>

1778
01:22:12.301 --> 01:22:13.134
<v Speaker 4>it's easy to get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The distinction you have to do is have </v>

1779
01:22:14.791 --> 01:22:16.530
<v Speaker 4>one person who hates you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>accuse you of.</v>

1780
01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:17.610
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bam.</v>

1781
01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:18.580
<v Speaker 4>So now what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1782
01:22:18.581 --> 01:22:19.414
<v Speaker 4>so I'm just saying we better start </v>
<v Speaker 4>making these distinctions are mines </v>

1783
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:22.833
<v Speaker 4>forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where the white nights will step </v>

1784
01:22:23.911 --> 01:22:27.060
<v Speaker 4>in and say what is most important is </v>
<v Speaker 4>women safety.</v>

1785
01:22:27.210 --> 01:22:28.043
<v Speaker 4>And if I have to be wrongly accused,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a conversation with a guy who </v>

1786
01:22:30.541 --> 01:22:33.630
<v Speaker 4>actually said that on a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said that if,</v>

1787
01:22:33.690 --> 01:22:34.523
<v Speaker 4>if he was wrongly accused,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he would be happier with that than </v>

1788
01:22:39.361 --> 01:22:42.300
<v Speaker 4>with a woman facing some sort of sexual </v>
<v Speaker 4>assault,</v>

1789
01:22:42.301 --> 01:22:44.550
<v Speaker 4>which is this first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as if they're in any way,</v>

1790
01:22:44.551 --> 01:22:46.430
<v Speaker 4>shape or form connected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Personally,</v>

1791
01:22:46.570 --> 01:22:47.403
<v Speaker 4>it goes back to my point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrongly accused means you have a shitty </v>

1792
01:22:49.021 --> 01:22:52.110
<v Speaker 4>system and someone lied like it </v>
<v Speaker 4>shouldn't.</v>

1793
01:22:52.111 --> 01:22:54.630
<v Speaker 4>That shouldn't be the case at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that it shouldn't be an option.</v>

1794
01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.580
<v Speaker 4>That goes back to my point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not gonna.</v>

1795
01:22:56.610 --> 01:22:59.250
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to liberate women by </v>
<v Speaker 4>falsely accusing.</v>

1796
01:22:59.370 --> 01:23:00.203
<v Speaker 4>Men were so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy's like signing up to be the </v>

1797
01:23:03.361 --> 01:23:06.370
<v Speaker 4>diminished party signing up to be the </v>
<v Speaker 4>more vulnerable parts.</v>

1798
01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:08.320
<v Speaker 4>I'll take the hit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take the hit.</v>

1799
01:23:08.321 --> 01:23:09.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm a white knight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1800
01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:10.413
<v Speaker 4>it is a light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's also not happening to him when </v>

1801
01:23:13.541 --> 01:23:15.430
<v Speaker 4>he's talking about it because it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

1802
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:16.263
<v Speaker 4>You'd be freaking out screaming your </v>
<v Speaker 4>innocence from a rooftop yelling about </v>

1803
01:23:19.451 --> 01:23:20.284
<v Speaker 4>how you used to be a feminist because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't believe this is happening because </v>

1804
01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:23.400
<v Speaker 4>10 injustice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1805
01:23:23.401 --> 01:23:27.100
<v Speaker 4>it is an injustice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a gang of injustices there.</v>

1806
01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:31.270
<v Speaker 4>The grabbing and the pussy grabbing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's an injustice to write.</v>

1807
01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:33.190
<v Speaker 4>It's just like what's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where's the level?</v>

1808
01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:36.820
<v Speaker 4>And I think one thing as men that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>easy to think of is,</v>

1809
01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:37.753
<v Speaker 4>is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's easy to forget that when you're a </v>

1810
01:23:40.631 --> 01:23:41.464
<v Speaker 4>chick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole nother element when </v>

1811
01:23:44.081 --> 01:23:47.410
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with men and that element</v>
<v Speaker 4>is size,</v>

1812
01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.940
<v Speaker 4>strength,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and even though violence is five,</v>

1813
01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:54.220
<v Speaker 4>highly unlikely in any work place </v>
<v Speaker 4>scenario,</v>

1814
01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:55.563
<v Speaker 4>you still feel like if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your body knows that if the shit went </v>

1815
01:23:58.961 --> 01:24:00.970
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump could choke you to death.</v>

1816
01:24:01.690 --> 01:24:02.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't,</v>

1817
01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:04.270
<v Speaker 4>don't you think your body would know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

1818
01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.810
<v Speaker 4>Not only does your body know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but women all around you.</v>

1819
01:24:06.820 --> 01:24:08.020
<v Speaker 4>If he grabbed you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's bigger than you.</v>

1820
01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:08.933
<v Speaker 4>You know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1821
01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:10.043
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He grabbed you in wanting to kiss you </v>

1822
01:24:11.081 --> 01:24:11.914
<v Speaker 4>and just grabbed you and kiss you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would that be assault if he grabbed you </v>

1823
01:24:14.740 --> 01:24:15.740
<v Speaker 4>and him alone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He grabs you,</v>

1824
01:24:15.980 --> 01:24:16.930
<v Speaker 4>grabs you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Package.</v>

1825
01:24:17.490 --> 01:24:19.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he shoved his tongue down.</v>

1826
01:24:19.071 --> 01:24:20.650
<v Speaker 4>Usually pins you up against walls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That assault.</v>

1827
01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:22.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I beat his ass though.</v>

1828
01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:26.980
<v Speaker 4>What of your heart?</v>
<v Speaker 4>God got me confused.</v>

1829
01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.470
<v Speaker 4>And what does he smell?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good does he,</v>

1830
01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:30.790
<v Speaker 4>does he have trump breath?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1831
01:24:31.090 --> 01:24:31.923
<v Speaker 4>I think you're totally right about these</v>
<v Speaker 4>committees in campuses and universities </v>

1832
01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:36.993
<v Speaker 4>and I also think there's a real problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>and telling young kids are victims when </v>

1833
01:24:39.221 --> 01:24:41.920
<v Speaker 4>they might not necessarily be victims </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you know,</v>

1834
01:24:41.921 --> 01:24:42.460
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1835
01:24:42.460 --> 01:24:46.000
<v Speaker 4>you enforce this sort of victim </v>
<v Speaker 4>mentality and then you get people really</v>

1836
01:24:46.001 --> 01:24:46.834
<v Speaker 4>hooked on outrage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting hooked on outrage as opposed to </v>

1837
01:24:48.911 --> 01:24:51.850
<v Speaker 4>getting hooked on acceptance and working</v>
<v Speaker 4>on your own,</v>

1838
01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:54.430
<v Speaker 4>your own self and your own thing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your own issues,</v>

1839
01:24:54.730 --> 01:24:56.590
<v Speaker 4>but you're also taking power away from </v>
<v Speaker 4>women when you do that.</v>

1840
01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:57.760
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what he's saying is that,</v>

1841
01:24:57.761 --> 01:24:58.594
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so women have to be protected at all </v>

1842
01:24:59.771 --> 01:25:02.710
<v Speaker 4>costs and that's the most important </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1843
01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:05.410
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will be there,</v>

1844
01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:06.363
<v Speaker 4>I will have legislation there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will have committees there and all of </v>

1845
01:25:08.891 --> 01:25:09.724
<v Speaker 4>us are going to protect women on campus </v>
<v Speaker 4>and because they can't protect </v>

1846
01:25:13.151 --> 01:25:14.080
<v Speaker 4>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't,</v>

1847
01:25:14.110 --> 01:25:14.943
<v Speaker 4>they can't look out for danger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can't see because I win in most of </v>

1848
01:25:19.121 --> 01:25:19.990
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know that what?</v>

1849
01:25:19.991 --> 01:25:22.510
<v Speaker 4>Even a 100 men are safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's always one seminar.</v>

1850
01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:25.510
<v Speaker 4>Let me stop you there because here's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to go back and forth because</v>

1851
01:25:25.511 --> 01:25:27.790
<v Speaker 4>you and I agree on this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's the question.</v>

1852
01:25:28.140 --> 01:25:31.420
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you stop campus sexual assault?</v>

1853
01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:32.463
<v Speaker 4>Now that we know that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it where they're trying to stop or </v>

1854
01:25:35.831 --> 01:25:38.080
<v Speaker 4>getting people in trouble for shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not really sexual assault,</v>

1855
01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:39.093
<v Speaker 4>but we also know that there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys that are fucking douchebags and </v>

1856
01:25:42.191 --> 01:25:44.620
<v Speaker 4>guaranteed someone's going to get drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's happened before.</v>

1857
01:25:44.621 --> 01:25:46.470
<v Speaker 4>They've caught them on tape or people </v>
<v Speaker 4>are passed down.</v>

1858
01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.460
<v Speaker 4>There's a train of dudes out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bedroom.</v>

1859
01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:51.460
<v Speaker 4>How do you stop people from doing shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>like that?</v>

1860
01:25:51.461 --> 01:25:52.294
<v Speaker 4>That's the real question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like accusing more people </v>

1861
01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:56.073
<v Speaker 4>because then you're going to get people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are even more frustrated with the </v>

1862
01:25:58.661 --> 01:25:59.494
<v Speaker 4>opposite sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you find out that guys are getting </v>

1863
01:26:01.241 --> 01:26:03.740
<v Speaker 4>locked up in jail for doing the exact </v>
<v Speaker 4>same thing,</v>

1864
01:26:03.741 --> 01:26:04.280
<v Speaker 4>their girlfriend</v>

1865
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:05.113
<v Speaker 3>was both being drunk and both having sex</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the guy all of a sudden is a sexual </v>

1866
01:26:08.001 --> 01:26:10.370
<v Speaker 3>Predator because he's drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are two ways to do it.</v>

1867
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:14.060
<v Speaker 3>The first is you raise awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that the second is you.</v>

1868
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:16.130
<v Speaker 3>You learn we're not to place your </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy.</v>

1869
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:17.143
<v Speaker 3>You learn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not to be pointing your guns </v>

1870
01:26:18.650 --> 01:26:21.580
<v Speaker 3>because when you do the other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you diminish,</v>

1871
01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:23.270
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1872
01:26:23.290 --> 01:26:24.123
<v Speaker 3>you are not making the problem better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we're wasting a lot of time and </v>

1873
01:26:26.541 --> 01:26:29.290
<v Speaker 3>energy in by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>

1874
01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:34.320
<v Speaker 3>by sort of condemning and going after </v>
<v Speaker 3>this ankle when we should be like,</v>

1875
01:26:35.100 --> 01:26:35.500
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1876
01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.250
<v Speaker 3>It goes back to what does that wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying?</v>

1877
01:26:37.251 --> 01:26:38.084
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's how you think that what's more </v>

1878
01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:41.840
<v Speaker 3>important is not what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but how you think.</v>

1879
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:45.500
<v Speaker 3>It's like a woman says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these radical Islamists are bastards and</v>

1880
01:26:45.501 --> 01:26:46.480
<v Speaker 3>my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1881
01:26:46.620 --> 01:26:47.960
<v Speaker 3>we should just eradicate all of them.</v>

1882
01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:49.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sound like a Nazi.</v>

1883
01:26:49.491 --> 01:26:51.530
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the Nazis and nicest.</v>

1884
01:26:51.531 --> 01:26:54.470
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking exactly how your enemy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the person you're criticizing us.</v>

1885
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:56.630
<v Speaker 3>So it's really methodology here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1886
01:26:56.631 --> 01:26:57.464
<v Speaker 3>you would know this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a good question for you because </v>

1887
01:26:58.791 --> 01:27:03.500
<v Speaker 3>somebody said when he wrote this the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other day about how when we call Isis,</v>

1888
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:04.783
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we first started having conflicts </v>

1889
01:27:06.651 --> 01:27:11.540
<v Speaker 3>in the Middle East after the Iraq war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a Sunni and Shia in Iraq,</v>

1890
01:27:12.050 --> 01:27:14.870
<v Speaker 3>and then there's all these other groups </v>
<v Speaker 3>and factions,</v>

1891
01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:15.793
<v Speaker 3>the Taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's al Qaeda and there's a Boko </v>

1892
01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:19.920
<v Speaker 3>Haram,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's all these different factors.</v>

1893
01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:20.803
<v Speaker 3>We sort of kind of lumped them all </v>
<v Speaker 3>together and decided they were one big </v>

1894
01:27:23.661 --> 01:27:24.770
<v Speaker 3>enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a fact.</v>

1895
01:27:25.890 --> 01:27:26.723
<v Speaker 3>And I want you to say this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that guy and the drug commercial </v>

1896
01:27:28.261 --> 01:27:30.200
<v Speaker 3>that's eating the salad and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>goes.</v>

1897
01:27:30.201 --> 01:27:33.230
<v Speaker 3>So you're saying that if I buy drugs or </v>
<v Speaker 3>support terrorism,</v>

1898
01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:34.611
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1899
01:27:34.611 --> 01:27:36.020
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she,</v>

1900
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:40.490
<v Speaker 3>the fact that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think to draw the distinction though,</v>

1901
01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:41.870
<v Speaker 3>Taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is Talib?</v>

1902
01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:45.110
<v Speaker 3>It means student.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're a Taliban,</v>

1903
01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.730
<v Speaker 3>you're a student of the Koran,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1904
01:27:46.731 --> 01:27:48.370
<v Speaker 3>you're a student,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1905
01:27:48.670 --> 01:27:50.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>al Qaeda.</v>

1906
01:27:50.511 --> 01:27:51.344
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That means the base loosely translated </v>

1907
01:27:53.571 --> 01:27:54.650
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the base.</v>

1908
01:27:54.651 --> 01:27:58.280
<v Speaker 3>This is as now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this what they call themselves a?</v>

1909
01:27:58.281 --> 01:27:59.390
<v Speaker 3>I believe they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

1910
01:27:59.391 --> 01:28:00.224
<v Speaker 3>I think these were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these were names that were given to </v>

1911
01:28:01.821 --> 01:28:05.120
<v Speaker 3>themselves and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then a Boko Haram.</v>

1912
01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:08.510
<v Speaker 3>Haram in Arabic means a bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you say,</v>

1913
01:28:08.511 --> 01:28:09.344
<v Speaker 3>like an Arabic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times when something happens </v>

1914
01:28:10.281 --> 01:28:11.510
<v Speaker 3>that's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you always say you had,</v>

1915
01:28:11.511 --> 01:28:12.590
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1916
01:28:12.591 --> 01:28:13.790
<v Speaker 3>like that's fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1917
01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:17.570
<v Speaker 3>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Boko Haram is sort of a slang,</v>

1918
01:28:17.970 --> 01:28:18.803
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loosely translated idea that everything </v>

1919
01:28:20.901 --> 01:28:22.880
<v Speaker 3>western is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1920
01:28:22.970 --> 01:28:24.320
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's outrageous.</v>

1921
01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:25.453
<v Speaker 3>And it also part of those folks drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It also has happens to be the fact then </v>

1922
01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:33.860
<v Speaker 3>the case that these are all Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 3>movements,</v>

1923
01:28:33.980 --> 01:28:34.813
<v Speaker 3>but when you say Islamic movements,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be careful because what you're really </v>

1924
01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:38.030
<v Speaker 3>talking about is puritanical.</v>

1925
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:40.280
<v Speaker 3>The notion that there is a puritanical </v>
<v Speaker 3>strain.</v>

1926
01:28:40.281 --> 01:28:41.114
<v Speaker 3>There's only one form of Islam and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Islam is the Islam that the prophet </v>

1927
01:28:44.691 --> 01:28:47.060
<v Speaker 3>preached in the what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what century is it?</v>

1928
01:28:47.061 --> 01:28:49.820
<v Speaker 3>The 13th or 15th or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1929
01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:52.190
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

1930
01:28:52.191 --> 01:28:53.024
<v Speaker 3>if there's any glue to those groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is that they essentially adhere to a </v>

1931
01:28:57.681 --> 01:28:58.514
<v Speaker 3>very strident,</v>
<v Speaker 3>puritanical form of Islam with no room </v>

1932
01:29:02.611 --> 01:29:03.444
<v Speaker 3>for interpretation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is only right and wrong and they </v>

1933
01:29:07.801 --> 01:29:11.520
<v Speaker 3>are willing to resort to what they would</v>
<v Speaker 3>consider to be jihad,</v>

1934
01:29:11.650 --> 01:29:14.370
<v Speaker 3>which the root of which means struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then what they,</v>

1935
01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:16.010
<v Speaker 3>what they considered to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1936
01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:17.250
<v Speaker 3>violence isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>

1937
01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:18.084
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the only option and Islam must sail </v>

1938
01:29:20.731 --> 01:29:23.580
<v Speaker 3>in a sea of blood because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>only way it happens.</v>

1939
01:29:23.581 --> 01:29:25.880
<v Speaker 3>So there's all this sort of idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1940
01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:28.200
<v Speaker 3>will use the slave fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1941
01:29:28.201 --> 01:29:28.531
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1942
01:29:28.531 --> 01:29:30.630
<v Speaker 3>so that again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

1943
01:29:30.630 --> 01:29:32.970
<v Speaker 3>That's an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an ideology.</v>

1944
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:34.583
<v Speaker 3>You have to kill the bad guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you also have to win the workplace </v>

1945
01:29:36.450 --> 01:29:37.700
<v Speaker 3>of ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the battlefield,</v>

1946
01:29:37.730 --> 01:29:39.720
<v Speaker 3>the battlefield of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's very important.</v>

1947
01:29:39.721 --> 01:29:40.554
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the casualties are so one sided in </v>

1948
01:29:42.601 --> 01:29:43.434
<v Speaker 3>terms of like all of it is taking place </v>
<v Speaker 3>in one part of the world versus in our </v>

1949
01:29:46.561 --> 01:29:47.394
<v Speaker 3>part of the world where we're engaging </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a completely different spot in the </v>

1950
01:29:49.531 --> 01:29:51.810
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes martyrs,</v>

1951
01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:52.673
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes a lot of people get excited </v>

1952
01:29:54.031 --> 01:29:55.510
<v Speaker 3>about joining the cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1953
01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:58.740
<v Speaker 3>they see the imbalance and the conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also see.</v>

1954
01:29:58.741 --> 01:29:59.574
<v Speaker 3>They also see though that when they go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through Istanbul airport and they get </v>

1955
01:30:02.551 --> 01:30:05.640
<v Speaker 3>into Syria and they die really quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's,</v>

1956
01:30:05.641 --> 01:30:06.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1957
01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:08.520
<v Speaker 3>they're starting to realize very quickly</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's also a death sentence.</v>

1958
01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:10.110
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to fuck with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>peshmerga.</v>

1959
01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:11.460
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to fuck with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1960
01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.440
<v Speaker 3>the American Special Forces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1961
01:30:13.441 --> 01:30:17.250
<v Speaker 3>these guys are just getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now the Russians in you're,</v>

1962
01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:20.670
<v Speaker 3>you're asking for if you want to join </v>
<v Speaker 3>isol now,</v>

1963
01:30:21.230 --> 01:30:24.570
<v Speaker 3>please go ahead and have a real issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>with isis and Eisele a key.</v>

1964
01:30:24.571 --> 01:30:26.310
<v Speaker 3>They keep changing their name back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth,</v>

1965
01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:27.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't,</v>

1966
01:30:27.901 --> 01:30:30.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't Isi at one point in time.</v>

1967
01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:33.090
<v Speaker 3>I still state right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means the,</v>

1968
01:30:33.091 --> 01:30:34.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too many,</v>

1969
01:30:34.321 --> 01:30:36.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too many different isis.</v>

1970
01:30:36.180 --> 01:30:38.370
<v Speaker 3>This stick with one year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a new band.</v>

1971
01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:39.780
<v Speaker 3>They want to create a challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your name,</v>

1972
01:30:39.870 --> 01:30:40.820
<v Speaker 3>they want credit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>caliphate,</v>

1973
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:42.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to create an Islamic state,</v>

1974
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:44.850
<v Speaker 3>which means there are no those </v>
<v Speaker 3>boundaries.</v>

1975
01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:46.380
<v Speaker 3>Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember Lebanon,</v>

1976
01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:48.180
<v Speaker 3>those were British boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those were,</v>

1977
01:30:48.210 --> 01:30:52.020
<v Speaker 3>those were created by the British after </v>
<v Speaker 3>World War One a,</v>

1978
01:30:52.021 --> 01:30:54.210
<v Speaker 3>in some cases world war two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part,</v>

1979
01:30:54.211 --> 01:30:56.190
<v Speaker 3>those are British boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not so recent.</v>

1980
01:30:56.630 --> 01:30:57.960
<v Speaker 3>Think about how recent that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>folks.</v>

1981
01:30:57.990 --> 01:30:59.460
<v Speaker 3>Very recent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>

1982
01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:01.590
<v Speaker 3>That's not even a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing.</v>

1983
01:31:01.710 --> 01:31:02.543
<v Speaker 3>I think that the problem with Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalism is not as much a worry </v>

1984
01:31:04.551 --> 01:31:05.384
<v Speaker 3>because they're not offering anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Communism had a something that lasts </v>

1985
01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:10.473
<v Speaker 3>that that ideology lasted 70 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it lasted so long because </v>

1986
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:16.410
<v Speaker 3>communism was something that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>

1987
01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:20.220
<v Speaker 3>There was a compassionate element to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1988
01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:22.200
<v Speaker 3>don't believe in God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe in reason,</v>

1989
01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:25.290
<v Speaker 3>and let's live on communes and all share</v>
<v Speaker 3>and be nice to each other.</v>

1990
01:31:25.470 --> 01:31:26.303
<v Speaker 3>That idea is pretty potent and </v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the young people who are </v>

1991
01:31:29.971 --> 01:31:33.150
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure the world out and who </v>
<v Speaker 3>love each other and any sanders.</v>

1992
01:31:33.210 --> 01:31:35.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Goddamn Kami.</v>

1993
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:36.271
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1994
01:31:36.271 --> 01:31:39.180
<v Speaker 3>he's definitely a social thing to Bernie</v>
<v Speaker 3>sanders stepped in right now.</v>

1995
01:31:39.181 --> 01:31:41.970
<v Speaker 3>He would win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if he ran as an independent,</v>

1996
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:42.780
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1997
01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:45.390
<v Speaker 3>I can't let you people do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck the Democrats.</v>

1998
01:31:45.540 --> 01:31:48.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm going independent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need the libertarian.</v>

1999
01:31:48.151 --> 01:31:49.470
<v Speaker 3>They don't know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can do this.</v>

2000
01:31:49.471 --> 01:31:52.350
<v Speaker 3>We could figure this out folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a disaster tooled.</v>

2001
01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:53.873
<v Speaker 3>How dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just looks a little up in step in </v>

2002
01:31:55.411 --> 01:31:56.880
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has Got Shitty posture.</v>

2003
01:31:56.881 --> 01:31:58.740
<v Speaker 3>He needs one of those neck things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're hanging from the doorway.</v>

2004
01:31:58.830 --> 01:32:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks too old</v>

2005
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:03.430
<v Speaker 1>and he's just to please man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't forget about what he looks like.</v>

2006
01:32:03.431 --> 01:32:06.700
<v Speaker 1>He almost got in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got real close look,</v>

2007
01:32:06.701 --> 01:32:07.500
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2008
01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:11.180
<v Speaker 1>I think also that Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare he say such horrible things.</v>

2009
01:32:11.650 --> 01:32:12.530
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

2010
01:32:12.690 --> 01:32:14.110
<v Speaker 1>he's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2011
01:32:14.170 --> 01:32:15.003
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2012
01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:19.480
<v Speaker 1>I just think people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not very presidential and plead the</v>

2013
01:32:19.481 --> 01:32:24.070
<v Speaker 1>presidency is a symbolic post as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very much a symbolic post.</v>

2014
01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:25.870
<v Speaker 1>What would you listen to what you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>said?</v>

2015
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:27.750
<v Speaker 1>He's too old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's tall.</v>

2016
01:32:28.050 --> 01:32:30.640
<v Speaker 1>He's too old looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't seem very presidential.</v>

2017
01:32:30.670 --> 01:32:32.260
<v Speaker 1>That's what the electric say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2018
01:32:32.261 --> 01:32:33.880
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you say that though?</v>

2019
01:32:33.930 --> 01:32:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>

2020
01:32:35.081 --> 01:32:35.914
<v Speaker 1>That's when would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you don't think that if he stepped </v>

2021
01:32:38.591 --> 01:32:41.020
<v Speaker 1>in now as an independent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he'd have a real chance.</v>

2022
01:32:41.021 --> 01:32:41.854
<v Speaker 1>At the very least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would confuse the fuck out of the </v>

2023
01:32:43.361 --> 01:32:44.194
<v Speaker 1>system because there's a giant movement </v>
<v Speaker 1>of people that wanted to see him in </v>

2024
01:32:46.541 --> 01:32:47.030
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

2025
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:49.030
<v Speaker 1>You want to see him as democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative.</v>

2026
01:32:49.210 --> 01:32:50.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those people be super energized if </v>

2027
01:32:50.861 --> 01:32:52.150
<v Speaker 1>he did step in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

2028
01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno about that.</v>

2029
01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2030
01:32:55.470 --> 01:32:56.303
<v Speaker 1>I think for sure for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's still a giant movement </v>

2031
01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:01.690
<v Speaker 1>of people out there that love that guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and loved that he was.</v>

2032
01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.790
<v Speaker 1>He seemed to be like a guy who wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>greedy.</v>

2033
01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:05.560
<v Speaker 1>He seemed to be a guy who wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt.</v>

2034
01:33:05.561 --> 01:33:06.394
<v Speaker 1>Like how is this possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he is cropped and I don't </v>

2035
01:33:07.601 --> 01:33:09.250
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he is either.</v>

2036
01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:12.310
<v Speaker 1>But that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the number one issue with someone</v>

2037
01:33:12.311 --> 01:33:13.144
<v Speaker 1>like the Clintons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the thing is that everybody </v>

2038
01:33:14.531 --> 01:33:15.880
<v Speaker 1>thinks that that's the only way to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2039
01:33:16.150 --> 01:33:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the what,</v>

2040
01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:18.613
<v Speaker 1>what people that support the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that are really into being </v>

2041
01:33:21.431 --> 01:33:22.264
<v Speaker 1>Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have this thing that they've sort </v>

2042
01:33:24.281 --> 01:33:26.050
<v Speaker 1>of resigned themselves to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2043
01:33:26.051 --> 01:33:26.950
<v Speaker 1>this is politics.</v>

2044
01:33:26.950 --> 01:33:29.200
<v Speaker 1>This is how they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is politics as usual.</v>

2045
01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:30.373
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have an example of a guy like </v>

2046
01:33:31.331 --> 01:33:32.111
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

2047
01:33:32.111 --> 01:33:32.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2048
01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:35.680
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that guy like that guy didn't do</v>

2049
01:33:35.681 --> 01:33:36.730
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cal Come.</v>

2050
01:33:36.731 --> 01:33:38.980
<v Speaker 1>They have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to get that money to speak.</v>

2051
01:33:38.981 --> 01:33:41.080
<v Speaker 1>They have to do all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to talk to the banks.</v>

2052
01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:42.333
<v Speaker 1>They have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure they have to or is it just </v>

2053
01:33:44.110 --> 01:33:44.943
<v Speaker 1>this is what the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that do the things that you </v>

2054
01:33:47.111 --> 01:33:49.300
<v Speaker 1>liked the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also do these things.</v>

2055
01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Is that okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's okay for you,</v>

2056
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:55.570
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes I think that that things </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to happen by default,</v>

2057
01:33:55.571 --> 01:33:56.404
<v Speaker 1>so if you started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just say we we could return to </v>

2058
01:33:58.870 --> 01:34:02.260
<v Speaker 1>kind of scramble everything up and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to set point zero.</v>

2059
01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:07.090
<v Speaker 1>I feel like in 30 years we'd be right </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to where we started.</v>

2060
01:34:07.090 --> 01:34:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody talking about factory </v>
<v Speaker 1>farming.</v>

2061
01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:10.073
<v Speaker 1>It's talking to a guy who has been in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the food business forever and I was </v>

2062
01:34:12.131 --> 01:34:14.470
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a book called the tornado effect</v>

2063
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:15.833
<v Speaker 1>about when how food flavoring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When scientists figured out how to make </v>

2064
01:34:18.761 --> 01:34:22.810
<v Speaker 1>a corn chip tastes like a Taco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of changed everything because we</v>

2065
01:34:22.811 --> 01:34:26.110
<v Speaker 1>were able to isolate flavors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a machine that allowed us to.</v>

2066
01:34:26.111 --> 01:34:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Because we didn't know why strawberry </v>
<v Speaker 1>tastes like a strawberry on ours,</v>

2067
01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:30.810
<v Speaker 1>tastes like an orange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2068
01:34:30.910 --> 01:34:33.310
<v Speaker 1>and I had this guy on my podcast on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian Council and,</v>

2069
01:34:33.370 --> 01:34:34.440
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2070
01:34:34.441 --> 01:34:35.274
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who writes this book about how </v>

2071
01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:41.971
<v Speaker 1>food flavoring changed the way we ate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it ended up,</v>

2072
01:34:42.190 --> 01:34:47.190
<v Speaker 1>it allowed us to take very non </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutritious food and make it nutritious.</v>

2073
01:34:48.030 --> 01:34:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Trying to figure out how you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring this back to factory farming.</v>

2074
01:34:50.161 --> 01:34:54.790
<v Speaker 1>If we ended up and he was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how we need to get back to sort of,</v>

2075
01:34:54.791 --> 01:34:57.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family farming and farming and stuff.</v>

2076
01:34:57.650 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 1>But I</v>

2077
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.480
<v Speaker 3>talked to this guy who was in the food </v>
<v Speaker 3>business.</v>

2078
01:34:59.481 --> 01:34:59.991
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2079
01:34:59.991 --> 01:35:00.824
<v Speaker 3>the problem with that is that family </v>
<v Speaker 3>farms are a great idea and we do </v>

2080
01:35:03.621 --> 01:35:07.040
<v Speaker 3>probably need more family farms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what would happen is probably in the</v>

2081
01:35:07.050 --> 01:35:09.080
<v Speaker 3>next 20 years we'd be back to factory </v>
<v Speaker 3>farming.</v>

2082
01:35:09.081 --> 01:35:09.651
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>

2083
01:35:09.651 --> 01:35:10.484
<v Speaker 3>He said what would happen is that some </v>
<v Speaker 3>farms wouldn't be as efficient or they </v>

2084
01:35:13.851 --> 01:35:16.370
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't be as good and in another farms</v>
<v Speaker 3>better and that farm and say,</v>

2085
01:35:16.371 --> 01:35:18.500
<v Speaker 3>let me buy you a farm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a better job,</v>

2086
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:20.060
<v Speaker 3>and then that he'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me buy this farm,</v>

2087
01:35:20.061 --> 01:35:20.894
<v Speaker 3>and then he had all of a sudden he'd buy</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the farms in this area because he's </v>

2088
01:35:22.191 --> 01:35:25.820
<v Speaker 3>really good at organization automation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything else and that would start</v>

2089
01:35:25.821 --> 01:35:26.654
<v Speaker 3>to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then a bigger company to come along and </v>

2090
01:35:27.531 --> 01:35:28.790
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me buy all your farms,</v>

2091
01:35:28.810 --> 01:35:29.643
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got market share here and I can </v>

2092
01:35:30.621 --> 01:35:32.840
<v Speaker 3>do this even better because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>better way to do it.</v>

2093
01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:33.673
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep the prices stable because we're </v>

2094
01:35:35.841 --> 01:35:36.674
<v Speaker 3>going to have a lot of eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I hop I have doesn't have to </v>

2095
01:35:39.261 --> 01:35:40.011
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well today,</v>

2096
01:35:40.011 --> 01:35:40.844
<v Speaker 3>since we only get our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our eggs from a local source today </v>

2097
01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:46.900
<v Speaker 3>they're the eggs are $5.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas yesterday were three 99.</v>

2098
01:35:47.150 --> 01:35:47.983
<v Speaker 3>That's kind of what would happen because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would depend on production and </v>

2099
01:35:51.281 --> 01:35:53.960
<v Speaker 3>distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he was kind of saying,</v>

2100
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.823
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's nice to think that we need family </v>

2101
01:35:56.451 --> 01:35:57.284
<v Speaker 3>farming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but chances are with such a huge </v>

2102
01:35:59.421 --> 01:36:02.450
<v Speaker 3>population that we have to feed the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>we do it as quickly as we do,</v>

2103
01:36:02.690 --> 01:36:04.670
<v Speaker 3>we'd probably be back to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2104
01:36:04.671 --> 01:36:05.504
<v Speaker 3>we're running out of chickens who can </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a chicken that can mature in six </v>

2105
01:36:07.041 --> 01:36:08.330
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the big issue.</v>

2106
01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:12.170
<v Speaker 3>The big issue is the population and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>big issue</v>

2107
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:15.420
<v Speaker 4>will do their best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2108
01:36:15.421 --> 01:36:16.254
<v Speaker 4>they do their best to recycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do their best to try to figure out </v>

2109
01:36:19.531 --> 01:36:20.364
<v Speaker 4>how to pollute the least and consume the</v>
<v Speaker 4>least and leave the smallest carbon </v>

2110
01:36:23.581 --> 01:36:25.320
<v Speaker 4>footprint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And some people are very conscious about</v>

2111
01:36:25.321 --> 01:36:26.154
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's a lot of things that people </v>

2112
01:36:27.391 --> 01:36:30.900
<v Speaker 4>overlook and one of them is all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetables that you get from the grocery</v>

2113
01:36:30.901 --> 01:36:32.940
<v Speaker 4>store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter what,</v>

2114
01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:33.953
<v Speaker 4>if you think you are somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 4>Karma free because you're only eating </v>

2115
01:36:36.361 --> 01:36:37.710
<v Speaker 4>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

2116
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:38.663
<v Speaker 4>I hate to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that whole thing of growing </v>

2117
01:36:41.101 --> 01:36:41.934
<v Speaker 4>vegetables in mass is only slightly less</v>
<v Speaker 4>controversial than growing animals in </v>

2118
01:36:47.341 --> 01:36:48.960
<v Speaker 4>mass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all weird.</v>

2119
01:36:48.990 --> 01:36:51.060
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of displacement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wildlife.</v>

2120
01:36:51.210 --> 01:36:53.880
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of pollution of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment due to pesticides,</v>

2121
01:36:53.881 --> 01:36:55.980
<v Speaker 4>the runoff from the salt and sea that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was telling you about.</v>

2122
01:36:56.310 --> 01:37:00.410
<v Speaker 4>That's all directly attributed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>farming and most of it is agriculture.</v>

2123
01:37:00.410 --> 01:37:02.370
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking pesticides and shit.</v>

2124
01:37:02.371 --> 01:37:07.020
<v Speaker 4>It all flows down down river and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked and there's a lot of other issues</v>

2125
01:37:07.090 --> 01:37:09.330
<v Speaker 4>like first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not natural.</v>

2126
01:37:09.510 --> 01:37:11.640
<v Speaker 4>It's not natural to keep growing things </v>
<v Speaker 4>in one spot.</v>

2127
01:37:11.670 --> 01:37:13.890
<v Speaker 4>That is just not how the world is </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to be designed.</v>

2128
01:37:14.190 --> 01:37:15.023
<v Speaker 4>It's supposed to be a gigantic cycle of </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals dying and their bodies rotting </v>

2129
01:37:20.111 --> 01:37:23.520
<v Speaker 4>and their bodies fueling the plants that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they actually eat,</v>

2130
01:37:23.521 --> 01:37:28.260
<v Speaker 4>and then animals eat them and they die </v>
<v Speaker 4>and their bodies rod and fuel the plants</v>

2131
01:37:28.261 --> 01:37:31.140
<v Speaker 4>that grow around them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've circumvented that thing with these</v>

2132
01:37:31.141 --> 01:37:31.974
<v Speaker 4>giant things we call cities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We figured out a way to stack all these </v>

2133
01:37:34.831 --> 01:37:35.664
<v Speaker 4>people on top of each other and then we </v>
<v Speaker 4>had to figure out a way to get them all </v>

2134
01:37:37.441 --> 01:37:41.190
<v Speaker 4>food because the fucking buildings kept </v>
<v Speaker 4>growing and the people kept needing more</v>

2135
01:37:41.191 --> 01:37:43.740
<v Speaker 4>and more and more and they're running </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of room fuck.</v>

2136
01:37:43.950 --> 01:37:47.700
<v Speaker 4>And so that's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the problem is we got the cart way ahead</v>

2137
01:37:47.701 --> 01:37:50.040
<v Speaker 4>of the train,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're what we're way ahead of it.</v>

2138
01:37:50.250 --> 01:37:51.083
<v Speaker 4>And we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't anticipate for 7 billion </v>

2139
01:37:52.981 --> 01:37:53.814
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we didn't anticipate for 300 million </v>

2140
01:37:55.411 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 4>Americans and</v>

2141
01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:00.090
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of doing it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even with our vegetables,</v>

2142
01:38:00.390 --> 01:38:03.330
<v Speaker 1>we're fucking up giant chunks of land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2143
01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:08.390
<v Speaker 1>even with our vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you think it's not easy like this</v>

2144
01:38:08.461 --> 01:38:12.810
<v Speaker 1>idea that it's easy to feed a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people at 20 million people with a Vegan</v>

2145
01:38:12.811 --> 01:38:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Diet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddammit,</v>

2146
01:38:14.130 --> 01:38:14.963
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to feed 20 million people </v>

2147
01:38:16.171 --> 01:38:21.171
<v Speaker 1>with any kind of diet and it requires a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of resources and organization and,</v>

2148
01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:24.330
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of consolidation.</v>

2149
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2150
01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:28.980
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine it's not saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>factory farming from animals is awesome.</v>

2151
01:38:28.981 --> 01:38:29.814
<v Speaker 1>It's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's scary that it got this far and he </v>

2152
01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:33.810
<v Speaker 1>got this far while we weren't paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to it,</v>

2153
01:38:34.110 --> 01:38:37.890
<v Speaker 1>all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think pretty much all Americans at one</v>

2154
01:38:37.891 --> 01:38:40.660
<v Speaker 1>point in their life had to be told of </v>
<v Speaker 1>factory farming.</v>

2155
01:38:40.661 --> 01:38:41.760
<v Speaker 1>And then when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck,</v>

2156
01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:44.490
<v Speaker 1>like this wasn't something that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed when we were in high school.</v>

2157
01:38:44.730 --> 01:38:45.563
<v Speaker 1>When I was in college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was never a word and I was barely </v>

2158
01:38:47.851 --> 01:38:48.684
<v Speaker 1>in college by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I was in college were the same </v>

2159
01:38:54.391 --> 01:38:56.250
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm.</v>

2160
01:38:56.440 --> 01:39:00.150
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is no one discussed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't this gigantic issue.</v>

2161
01:39:00.300 --> 01:39:03.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we were quite as aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another creepy things.</v>

2162
01:39:03.150 --> 01:39:03.983
<v Speaker 1>Those AG gag laws were to legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to film these horrific conditions that </v>

2163
01:39:07.771 --> 01:39:10.680
<v Speaker 1>pigs Robert concerns have to live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's you can.</v>

2164
01:39:10.710 --> 01:39:11.543
<v Speaker 1>You can go to jail for letting people </v>
<v Speaker 1>know about animal torture that's being </v>

2165
01:39:15.121 --> 01:39:18.300
<v Speaker 1>taken place where they're hitting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking cow in the head with a wrench.</v>

2166
01:39:18.301 --> 01:39:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I saw this crazy video of this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>crowbars a cow in the head.</v>

2167
01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:26.010
<v Speaker 1>The first time I ever saw the first time</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ever learned about factory farming was</v>

2168
01:39:26.011 --> 01:39:26.844
<v Speaker 1>there as a pamphlet in my college and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about how smart pigs </v>

2169
01:39:29.911 --> 01:39:30.750
<v Speaker 1>are and how they.</v>

2170
01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:31.693
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They showed a picture of a pig chewing </v>

2171
01:39:32.971 --> 01:39:37.350
<v Speaker 1>the bars independent within and how pigs</v>
<v Speaker 1>go crazy because they want to roam with.</v>

2172
01:39:37.351 --> 01:39:38.184
<v Speaker 1>They're too smart to just sit in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pen and I got so claustrophobic that I </v>

2173
01:39:41.071 --> 01:39:43.140
<v Speaker 1>didn't eat bacon for a year out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion.</v>

2174
01:39:43.141 --> 01:39:45.270
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't eat bacon now to Kenny Baker.</v>

2175
01:39:45.271 --> 01:39:46.690
<v Speaker 1>And then he was right back on the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

2176
01:39:46.710 --> 01:39:48.480
<v Speaker 1>And then I read a book called fit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

2177
01:39:48.481 --> 01:39:52.680
<v Speaker 1>which was all about being a vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try that for about six days.</v>

2178
01:39:52.710 --> 01:39:54.810
<v Speaker 1>Didn't work for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't do it.</v>

2179
01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian is way more healthy than just</v>

2180
01:39:57.931 --> 01:40:00.570
<v Speaker 1>going straight Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as like own,</v>

2181
01:40:00.590 --> 01:40:01.423
<v Speaker 1>I say way more healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that it's easier to be waiting </v>

2182
01:40:03.361 --> 01:40:05.490
<v Speaker 1>on healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can pull off the Vegan thing if</v>

2183
01:40:05.491 --> 01:40:06.324
<v Speaker 1>you're super on the ball with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential fats and you make sure you </v>

2184
01:40:09.571 --> 01:40:10.680
<v Speaker 1>take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it,</v>

2185
01:40:10.681 --> 01:40:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Dah da.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a pet.</v>

2186
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:13.541
<v Speaker 1>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2187
01:40:13.541 --> 01:40:14.620
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

2188
01:40:14.970 --> 01:40:18.090
<v Speaker 1>Omega threes and sixes that you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the fuck.</v>

2189
01:40:18.091 --> 01:40:23.091
<v Speaker 1>Is that stuff called that you get from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>flag from Kelp?</v>

2190
01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Flaxseed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flaxseed,</v>

2191
01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:27.713
<v Speaker 1>flaxseed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But apparently the biological stuff is </v>

2192
01:40:30.571 --> 01:40:31.404
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Omega threes and sixes that you </v>

2193
01:40:33.141 --> 01:40:35.420
<v Speaker 1>can help an animal though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2194
01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:39.420
<v Speaker 1>it's plant kelp is not thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about Krill.</v>

2195
01:40:39.810 --> 01:40:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Krill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2196
01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an animal.</v>

2197
01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:42.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2198
01:40:42.001 --> 01:40:46.770
<v Speaker 1>here's another thing that a Sam Harris </v>
<v Speaker 1>was telling me is that mollusks,</v>

2199
01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:49.290
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least if you look at them on paper,</v>

2200
01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:50.273
<v Speaker 1>there's more of an argument to be made </v>
<v Speaker 1>that plants are intelligent than </v>

2201
01:40:53.050 --> 01:40:54.000
<v Speaker 1>molochs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2202
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Models.</v>

2203
01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:57.520
<v Speaker 1>They don't feel shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a little blobs of snot.</v>

2204
01:40:57.830 --> 01:41:00.820
<v Speaker 1>It is living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come live in com that lives in a shell.</v>

2205
01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're weird.</v>

2206
01:41:02.681 --> 01:41:05.440
<v Speaker 1>There's a weird little things and </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently they're super,</v>

2207
01:41:05.441 --> 01:41:06.520
<v Speaker 1>super primitive.</v>

2208
01:41:07.090 --> 01:41:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Will all what we decide that they are an</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal that should not be eaten.</v>

2209
01:41:11.730 --> 01:41:12.563
<v Speaker 1>Whereas a plant is something that should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be eaten based on whether or not they </v>

2210
01:41:15.371 --> 01:41:16.260
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

2211
01:41:16.261 --> 01:41:17.700
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a scallop death?</v>

2212
01:41:17.701 --> 01:41:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Not the same as a mollusk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2213
01:41:19.001 --> 01:41:22.180
<v Speaker 1>this Gallup is a mollusk clams mussels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scallops.</v>

2214
01:41:22.181 --> 01:41:24.340
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different shelled </v>
<v Speaker 1>organisms,</v>

2215
01:41:24.850 --> 01:41:26.290
<v Speaker 1>but they're super,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super,</v>

2216
01:41:26.291 --> 01:41:28.600
<v Speaker 1>super primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not have nerve endings.</v>

2217
01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:29.381
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2218
01:41:29.381 --> 01:41:30.214
<v Speaker 1>they don't feel pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the other thing about </v>

2219
01:41:31.450 --> 01:41:33.260
<v Speaker 1>lobsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lobsters is creeping.</v>

2220
01:41:33.261 --> 01:41:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Where do they are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they don't feel pain.</v>

2221
01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:36.783
<v Speaker 1>Too primitive to feel pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a great essay by David Foster </v>

2222
01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:42.460
<v Speaker 1>Wallace called consider the lobster and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about this.</v>

2223
01:41:42.690 --> 01:41:43.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2224
01:41:43.491 --> 01:41:47.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a thing called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lobster liberation organization to break</v>

2225
01:41:47.171 --> 01:41:50.310
<v Speaker 1>into restaurants and they take lots and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they throw them back in the ocean.</v>

2226
01:41:50.630 --> 01:41:51.970
<v Speaker 1>What kind of a one?</v>

2227
01:41:51.970 --> 01:41:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Kind of a radical group that's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get proof for that group.</v>

2228
01:41:56.170 --> 01:41:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I just want to get that phone call from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From jail.</v>

2229
01:41:59.650 --> 01:42:00.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which you do.</v>

2230
01:42:00.911 --> 01:42:04.210
<v Speaker 1>So we met from the law to get into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fistfight.</v>

2231
01:42:04.450 --> 01:42:07.240
<v Speaker 1>What did you read?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This pamphlet would judge me.</v>

2232
01:42:07.241 --> 01:42:08.280
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I uh,</v>

2233
01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:12.700
<v Speaker 1>I let a lobster free what I let lobsters</v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

2234
01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those giant Cunty roaches.</v>

2235
01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:16.990
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just bite your fingers off.</v>

2236
01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:20.080
<v Speaker 1>You let those things for dummy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are members.</v>

2237
01:42:20.081 --> 01:42:22.010
<v Speaker 1>Delicious insect family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the other they are.</v>

2238
01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:25.700
<v Speaker 1>That's why if you eat cricket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a flower like that,</v>

2239
01:42:25.701 --> 01:42:30.130
<v Speaker 1>it was a thing in protein bars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have an allergy to shellfish,</v>

2240
01:42:30.131 --> 01:42:33.280
<v Speaker 1>you can break out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's so true,</v>

2241
01:42:33.281 --> 01:42:36.250
<v Speaker 1>and I can validate that by fear factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear factor.</v>

2242
01:42:36.251 --> 01:42:37.084
<v Speaker 1>We gave people roaches and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes that we gave roaches was allergic </v>

2243
01:42:39.251 --> 01:42:40.084
<v Speaker 1>to shellfish.</v>

2244
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:43.020
<v Speaker 1>So when he ate the roaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got sick due to Roche.</v>

2245
01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like very overrated is.</v>

2246
01:42:46.661 --> 01:42:47.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

2247
01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:50.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tasting is not a big deal.</v>

2248
01:42:50.230 --> 01:42:51.063
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't hard to do hate the body that </v>

2249
01:42:52.690 --> 01:42:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a giant one.</v>

2250

<v Speaker 1>It was a Madagascar hissing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cockroaches.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a live on that.</v>

2252
01:42:59.471 --> 01:43:00.730

<v Speaker 1>you or no?</v>

01:43:53.730 --> 01:43:56.150
<v Speaker 1>the whole um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little legs and shit,</v>

2279
01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

2280
01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:01.550
<v Speaker 1>you're chewing up this hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard skeleton and trying to swallow that</v>

2281
01:44:01.551 --> 01:44:03.500
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That made me gag a couple of times.</v>

2282
01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:05.990
<v Speaker 1>But as far as like taste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really nothing.</v>

2283
01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:09.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like almost like a void of taste </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Merlin Mann.</v>

2284
01:44:09.030 --> 01:44:12.230
<v Speaker 1>Allah gave me the back of the deer's </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyeball.</v>

2285
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:13.071
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

2286
01:44:13.071 --> 01:44:13.904
<v Speaker 1>It was fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said to that just like chewing </v>

2287
01:44:15.531 --> 01:44:16.364
<v Speaker 1>gum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2288
01:44:17.110 --> 01:44:19.160
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it tastes like dough.</v>

2289
01:44:19.210 --> 01:44:20.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dough.</v>

2290
01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like bread dough.</v>

2291
01:44:21.290 --> 01:44:23.600
<v Speaker 1>It did SORTA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like bread dough,</v>

2292
01:44:23.660 --> 01:44:26.090
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's fat behind the eyes.</v>

2293
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:29.030
<v Speaker 1>While I appreciated the fact that he eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>that too.</v>

2294
01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:30.610
<v Speaker 1>He eats everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah.</v>

2295
01:44:30.630 --> 01:44:33.630
<v Speaker 1>Know that guy has more respect for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2296
01:44:33.670 --> 01:44:35.690
<v Speaker 1>a downed animal than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2297
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:36.980
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any hunter of.</v>

2298
01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy down to dude,</v>

2299
01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:40.560
<v Speaker 1>you did I miss.</v>

2300
01:44:41.010 --> 01:44:41.850
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this a thing?</v>

2301
01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:44.160
<v Speaker 4>Here's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everybody can't do that.</v>

2302
01:44:44.190 --> 01:44:45.023
<v Speaker 4>That's a really important point to point</v>
<v Speaker 4>to bring up whenever we're also pro </v>

2303
01:44:48.931 --> 01:44:49.764
<v Speaker 4>hunting and talking about how great it </v>
<v Speaker 4>is to eat animals that you've harvested </v>

2304
01:44:53.161 --> 01:44:54.960
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know exactly where they came from.</v>

2305
01:44:54.961 --> 01:44:55.950
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're wild.</v>

2306
01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:58.080
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've never been abused and never been</v>

2307
01:44:59.490 --> 01:45:02.010
<v Speaker 4>raised in slavery and Fed antibiotics </v>
<v Speaker 4>and hormones.</v>

2308
01:45:02.011 --> 01:45:03.840
<v Speaker 4>They lived wild until you shot him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2309
01:45:03.841 --> 01:45:06.460
<v Speaker 4>But everybody can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2310
01:45:06.630 --> 01:45:09.690
<v Speaker 4>there's a problem with that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like even even admitting that,</v>

2311
01:45:09.691 --> 01:45:12.420
<v Speaker 4>like even saying that like for me </v>
<v Speaker 4>personally,</v>

2312
01:45:12.421 --> 01:45:14.490
<v Speaker 4>it's the better option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy that option.</v>

2313
01:45:14.491 --> 01:45:17.640
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the best option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's still everybody can't do it,</v>

2314
01:45:17.641 --> 01:45:19.380
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're fucked no matter what.</v>

2315
01:45:19.410 --> 01:45:21.330
<v Speaker 4>But we've come a long way with just </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeding people.</v>

2316
01:45:21.331 --> 01:45:22.860
<v Speaker 4>Half the world was starving in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies,</v>

2317
01:45:22.890 --> 01:45:23.400
<v Speaker 4>of course with.</v>

2318
01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:24.810
<v Speaker 4>We just weren't back to what we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

2319
01:45:24.811 --> 01:45:25.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>factory farming.</v>

2320
01:45:25.951 --> 01:45:27.930
<v Speaker 4>That's how they did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they figured out how to do it.</v>

2321
01:45:28.710 --> 01:45:33.030
<v Speaker 4>Large scale agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>indiscriminant combines that chew up the</v>

2322
01:45:33.031 --> 01:45:33.864
<v Speaker 4>amount of animals that die when they </v>
<v Speaker 4>chew up the fucking grain and corn and </v>

2323
01:45:37.561 --> 01:45:38.460
<v Speaker 4>all the different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They.</v>

2324
01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:42.810
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking horror show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friend John Dudley who lives in Iowa,</v>

2325
01:45:42.811 --> 01:45:46.920
<v Speaker 4>he has a farm and he says when they run </v>
<v Speaker 4>those combines,</v>

2326
01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:50.400
<v Speaker 4>when they pick up whatever grains or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever they have,</v>

2327
01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:53.310
<v Speaker 4>they run these big giant ass machines </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he says,</v>

2328
01:45:53.311 --> 01:45:56.430
<v Speaker 4>you'll see the buzzards circling in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sky.</v>

2329
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:58.710
<v Speaker 4>Like they literally know that things are</v>
<v Speaker 4>just.</v>

2330
01:45:58.740 --> 01:45:59.573
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you mean like rats and rabbits and rats </v>

2331
01:46:01.381 --> 01:46:04.950
<v Speaker 4>and rabbits and deer fons and ground </v>
<v Speaker 4>nesting birds.</v>

2332
01:46:04.951 --> 01:46:06.030
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never thought of that.</v>

2333
01:46:06.031 --> 01:46:08.790
<v Speaker 4>All those animals don't realize that </v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

2334
01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:10.980
<v Speaker 4>what they're living in is temporary.</v>

2335
01:46:11.010 --> 01:46:11.821
<v Speaker 4>They look at it as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2336
01:46:11.821 --> 01:46:14.040
<v Speaker 4>this is an awesome shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go in here.</v>

2337
01:46:14.041 --> 01:46:17.310
<v Speaker 4>It's thick with all these branches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No predators are going to find me.</v>

2338
01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:19.950
<v Speaker 4>I'll just go here and nest so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that.</v>

2339
01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:23.080
<v Speaker 4>Now the green tea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never heard this grain combines.</v>

2340
01:46:23.110 --> 01:46:25.090
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever seen a green combine?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now Jamie,</v>

2341
01:46:25.150 --> 01:46:25.983
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull it up and you'll get an </v>

2342
01:46:26.311 --> 01:46:27.144
<v Speaker 4>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an understanding of what kind of volume </v>

2343
01:46:28.381 --> 01:46:29.430
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2344
01:46:29.530 --> 01:46:31.770
<v Speaker 4>so in your bread you're saying with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>grain,</v>

2345
01:46:31.771 --> 01:46:36.000
<v Speaker 4>because you have a lot of animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's totally that.</v>

2346
01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:37.320
<v Speaker 4>It's not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2347
01:46:37.321 --> 01:46:40.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how good it is for you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>how much of it gets baked off,</v>

2348
01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:44.130
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is it's not animal death</v>
<v Speaker 4>free.</v>

2349
01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:46.580
<v Speaker 4>It's just not right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were showing something.</v>

2350
01:46:46.590 --> 01:46:47.423
<v Speaker 4>Brian put up this video the other day of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a grain silo in Russia and now these </v>

2351
01:46:51.931 --> 01:46:56.220
<v Speaker 4>pigeons fall into the grain silo and try</v>
<v Speaker 4>to eat the grain.</v>

2352
01:46:56.220 --> 01:46:57.053
<v Speaker 4>Then gets sucked into the gears as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>the silo or the machine is turning up </v>

2353
01:47:01.891 --> 01:47:02.724
<v Speaker 4>the grain so they land on the grain and </v>
<v Speaker 4>try to get some of it and then they get </v>

2354
01:47:04.741 --> 01:47:07.770
<v Speaker 4>sucked into the gears over and over and </v>
<v Speaker 4>over and over again.</v>

2355
01:47:07.771 --> 01:47:08.604
<v Speaker 4>We're launching like 10:15</v>
<v Speaker 4>of them and like of course of a couple </v>

2356
01:47:10.381 --> 01:47:14.010
<v Speaker 4>of minutes get sucked into this machine </v>
<v Speaker 4>that chews up the pigeons.</v>

2357
01:47:14.011 --> 01:47:14.844
<v Speaker 4>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when they say what does the machine </v>

2358
01:47:17.041 --> 01:47:19.860
<v Speaker 4>taking the grain and making it finer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that what it's doing?</v>

2359
01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:21.901
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2360
01:47:21.901 --> 01:47:22.770
<v Speaker 4>but let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2361
01:47:22.771 --> 01:47:23.700
<v Speaker 4>well let's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's see.</v>

2362
01:47:23.701 --> 01:47:27.300
<v Speaker 4>A large view so we can get an </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding of the mass.</v>

2363
01:47:27.450 --> 01:47:29.070
<v Speaker 4>So that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a small one.</v>

2364
01:47:29.071 --> 01:47:33.420
<v Speaker 4>Look at large scale grain combine and </v>
<v Speaker 4>see if you could find a video of it,</v>

2365
01:47:33.630 --> 01:47:34.463
<v Speaker 4>but they have these fucking hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>feet long and they're just chewing up </v>

2366
01:47:37.711 --> 01:47:38.544
<v Speaker 4>giant chunks of these crops and when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing these large scale </v>

2367
01:47:40.801 --> 01:47:42.270
<v Speaker 4>agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that one right there.</v>

2368
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:43.500
<v Speaker 4>Perfect exam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But isn't that,</v>

2369
01:47:43.501 --> 01:47:44.334
<v Speaker 4>isn't that just clear cutting?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not actually using any of that </v>

2370
01:47:46.141 --> 01:47:46.500
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2371
01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:47.660
<v Speaker 4>it's using it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how,</v>

2372
01:47:47.730 --> 01:47:49.700
<v Speaker 4>that's how they chew that shit up dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2373
01:47:49.710 --> 01:47:50.960
<v Speaker 4>but that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not a,</v>

2374
01:47:51.210 --> 01:47:53.050
<v Speaker 4>that's actually isn't a cornfield.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

2375
01:47:53.060 --> 01:47:55.890
<v Speaker 4>they pick the corn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's actually um,</v>

2376
01:47:55.980 --> 01:47:56.813
<v Speaker 4>I believe that's a truck going through </v>
<v Speaker 4>it and taking out all those they can </v>

2377
01:48:00.391 --> 01:48:01.224
<v Speaker 4>replant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it is possible that that's what </v>

2378
01:48:02.671 --> 01:48:03.504
<v Speaker 4>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a bunch of different kinds </v>

2379
01:48:04.801 --> 01:48:07.320
<v Speaker 4>of machines they use for that same kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of purpose,</v>

2380
01:48:07.321 --> 01:48:10.350
<v Speaker 4>meaning for whether it's they're just </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to replant them,</v>

2381
01:48:10.690 --> 01:48:11.910
<v Speaker 4>whether it's their harvesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2382
01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:16.230
<v Speaker 4>there's got machines running over that </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground all the time,</v>

2383
01:48:16.231 --> 01:48:18.420
<v Speaker 4>like see if you could find the big </v>
<v Speaker 4>combines,</v>

2384
01:48:18.421 --> 01:48:22.620
<v Speaker 4>they spread out like a t and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's a truck and then to the right</v>

2385
01:48:22.621 --> 01:48:23.454
<v Speaker 4>and the left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they spread out on either side with </v>

2386
01:48:24.901 --> 01:48:25.734
<v Speaker 4>these just years that chopped down the </v>
<v Speaker 4>plants and then get them ready for </v>

2387
01:48:30.421 --> 01:48:30.960
<v Speaker 4>harvest.</v>

2388
01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:32.660
<v Speaker 4>And they also do it when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2389
01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:34.410
<v Speaker 4>when they're making hay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2390
01:48:34.411 --> 01:48:37.260
<v Speaker 4>they do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have these machines that they drive</v>

2391
01:48:37.261 --> 01:48:39.540
<v Speaker 4>through and chop everything down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they roll it up for hey,</v>

2392
01:48:39.541 --> 01:48:41.460
<v Speaker 4>like here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's a combine.</v>

2393
01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:44.190
<v Speaker 4>And that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as that guy pulls it,</v>

2394
01:48:44.250 --> 01:48:48.000
<v Speaker 4>that thing is chewing up every fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that's down there.</v>

2395
01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:49.073
<v Speaker 4>Everything and animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially Fonz is one of the weird </v>

2396
01:48:52.831 --> 01:48:55.050
<v Speaker 4>things about deer fonds when they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>really young,</v>

2397
01:48:55.051 --> 01:48:57.390
<v Speaker 4>they just stay put.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>

2398
01:48:57.430 --> 01:48:58.620
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they hear things,</v>

2399
01:48:58.621 --> 01:48:59.454
<v Speaker 4>you could literally walk up to a baby </v>
<v Speaker 4>deer fond and if the mom's not around </v>

2400
01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:03.293
<v Speaker 4>you can touch it because their instincts</v>
<v Speaker 4>until they get old enough to run away </v>

2401
01:49:06.901 --> 01:49:07.734
<v Speaker 4>from stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their instincts are to stay put just to </v>

2402
01:49:09.571 --> 01:49:10.404
<v Speaker 4>ensure survival.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of them get chewed up in this </v>

2403
01:49:13.801 --> 01:49:14.634
<v Speaker 4>and there was some estimation that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>read when they were talking about the </v>

2404
01:49:16.951 --> 01:49:17.784
<v Speaker 4>problems with this and the ways they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were trying to figure out how to </v>

2405
01:49:20.431 --> 01:49:24.220
<v Speaker 4>mitigate wildlife loss from use of </v>
<v Speaker 4>indiscriminate combine.</v>

2406
01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:25.053
<v Speaker 4>It's like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were talking about each pound </v>

2407
01:49:26.761 --> 01:49:29.400
<v Speaker 4>of grain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many animals has to die.</v>

2408
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:30.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what the number was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2409
01:49:30.841 --> 01:49:33.920
<v Speaker 4>this is the video of the pigeons that </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets shoved into this,</v>

2410
01:49:33.930 --> 01:49:36.090
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the grinder.</v>

2411
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:37.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Dude.</v>

2412
01:49:37.321 --> 01:49:38.880
<v Speaker 4>He goes on forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys?</v>

2413
01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:39.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoops.</v>

2414
01:49:39.890 --> 01:49:42.210
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they keep doing it.</v>

2415
01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:45.030
<v Speaker 4>So they're not smart enough to figure </v>
<v Speaker 4>out what's going on.</v>

2416
01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:45.931
<v Speaker 4>Look at that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoops.</v>

2417
01:49:45.931 --> 01:49:46.764
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

2418
01:49:46.900 --> 01:49:48.520
<v Speaker 4>This is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2419
01:49:48.780 --> 01:49:51.150
<v Speaker 4>Then this is going away there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Granted,</v>

2420
01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:51.851
<v Speaker 4>fly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You made it.</v>

2421
01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:53.380
<v Speaker 4>You made it to fly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well how about that?</v>

2422
01:49:53.381 --> 01:49:55.240
<v Speaker 4>One in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's just watching his buddies go down.</v>

2423
01:49:55.241 --> 01:49:56.074
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't say a goddamn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of them jumped right in the middle </v>

2424
01:49:57.311 --> 01:49:58.144
<v Speaker 4>of was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2425
01:49:58.300 --> 01:49:59.830
<v Speaker 4>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

2426
01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:02.350
<v Speaker 4>Just flag it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

2427
01:50:02.890 --> 01:50:04.270
<v Speaker 4>Guys said WHO's going to get smart now?</v>

2428
01:50:04.340 --> 01:50:07.330
<v Speaker 4>This one's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one's gone.</v>

2429
01:50:07.331 --> 01:50:09.280
<v Speaker 4>Say it dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2430
01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:12.790
<v Speaker 4>last week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet you could make a lot of money.</v>

2431
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:14.890
<v Speaker 4>This is what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a gambler's dream.</v>

2432
01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:15.813
<v Speaker 4>I got the one right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this one going to get down and I'd </v>

2433
01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:20.800
<v Speaker 4>have to have stacks of money on the name</v>
<v Speaker 4>of this video.</v>

2434
01:50:20.830 --> 01:50:22.030
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Dude,</v>

2435
01:50:22.031 --> 01:50:24.010
<v Speaker 4>you went to facebook exploding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2436
01:50:24.011 --> 01:50:28.330
<v Speaker 4>that's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the pigeons are being sucked in</v>

2437
01:50:28.331 --> 01:50:31.930
<v Speaker 4>with the green on a bread making plant </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Russia.</v>

2438
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:36.270
<v Speaker 4>Russian pity comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay man.</v>

2439
01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:37.630
<v Speaker 4>You too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>

2440
01:50:38.050 --> 01:50:38.883
<v Speaker 4>So the point is to make gigantic groups </v>
<v Speaker 4>of people happy and fed even just with </v>

2441
01:50:44.381 --> 01:50:46.570
<v Speaker 4>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need a lot of that stuff going on.</v>

2442
01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:49.270
<v Speaker 4>So it's not nice to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not nice.</v>

2443
01:50:49.300 --> 01:50:50.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2444
01:50:50.651 --> 01:50:51.484
<v Speaker 4>this is not defending factory farming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is obviously disgusting and </v>

2445
01:50:53.591 --> 01:50:54.424
<v Speaker 4>horrible and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's one of the darker aspects of human </v>

2446
01:50:59.141 --> 01:50:59.974
<v Speaker 4>civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that standard in the United </v>

2447
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:03.910
<v Speaker 4>States that that shit is really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

2448
01:51:03.911 --> 01:51:07.000
<v Speaker 4>really common and that's how we can </v>
<v Speaker 4>afford meat so cheap,</v>

2449
01:51:07.780 --> 01:51:10.420
<v Speaker 4>but even vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even vegetables,</v>

2450
01:51:10.421 --> 01:51:12.370
<v Speaker 4>it's not like growing your own shit.</v>

2451
01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:13.293
<v Speaker 4>Ideally what we're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those were all supposed to grow our own </v>

2452
01:51:16.481 --> 01:51:17.314
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all supposed to have a piece of </v>

2453
01:51:18.521 --> 01:51:19.354
<v Speaker 4>land and you're supposed to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetables on it and he's supposed to </v>

2454
01:51:21.311 --> 01:51:22.144
<v Speaker 4>have a few animals that you raised,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's for for milk or for cheese </v>

2455
01:51:25.541 --> 01:51:28.900
<v Speaker 4>or for meat or for whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be the way you could do it.</v>

2456
01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:30.850
<v Speaker 4>It's just not scalable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not scalable.</v>

2457
01:51:30.851 --> 01:51:32.020
<v Speaker 4>People would starve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2458
01:51:32.021 --> 01:51:32.854
<v Speaker 4>it's not scalable in terms of the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've decided to jam everybody into </v>

2459
01:51:35.471 --> 01:51:37.360
<v Speaker 4>these cities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not well.</v>

2460
01:51:37.690 --> 01:51:38.523
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that was just what would happen </v>

2461
01:51:39.911 --> 01:51:41.050
<v Speaker 4>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By default,</v>

2462
01:51:41.051 --> 01:51:44.050
<v Speaker 4>people organize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel safer in cities.</v>

2463
01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:47.470
<v Speaker 4>You get more access to food and shelter </v>
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>

2464
01:51:47.471 --> 01:51:49.530
<v Speaker 4>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you.</v>

2465
01:51:49.630 --> 01:51:51.820
<v Speaker 4>If you stop and think about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>requirements,</v>

2466
01:51:52.150 --> 01:51:54.610
<v Speaker 4>like the food requirements of all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

2467
01:51:54.611 --> 01:51:55.270
<v Speaker 4>people are.</v>

2468
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:58.090
<v Speaker 4>It's so easy for someone you and me </v>
<v Speaker 4>included to say,</v>

2469
01:51:58.150 --> 01:51:58.983
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have time to fucking gather and </v>

2470
01:52:00.461 --> 01:52:02.440
<v Speaker 4>hunt someone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go get my food.</v>

2471
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:04.560
<v Speaker 4>I've got to do comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to set,</v>

2472
01:52:04.570 --> 01:52:05.403
<v Speaker 4>I got to do at the Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go to the store and buy a </v>

2473
01:52:07.361 --> 01:52:08.260
<v Speaker 4>sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2474
01:52:08.261 --> 01:52:09.094
<v Speaker 4>like you want that access and it seems </v>
<v Speaker 4>like the only way you can get that kind </v>

2475
01:52:12.671 --> 01:52:15.910
<v Speaker 4>of access to supermarkets and fast food </v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurants,</v>

2476
01:52:15.911 --> 01:52:19.360
<v Speaker 4>the only way is this system that we've </v>
<v Speaker 4>got now,</v>

2477
01:52:19.630 --> 01:52:22.410
<v Speaker 4>like where you've just got massive </v>
<v Speaker 4>amounts of animals.</v>

2478
01:52:22.411 --> 01:52:23.244
<v Speaker 4>They're getting slaughtered it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It allows for thought and things that </v>

2479
01:52:27.161 --> 01:52:27.994
<v Speaker 4>you see if you have to live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have spent so much of your time </v>

2480
01:52:29.591 --> 01:52:32.640
<v Speaker 4>just feeding yourself and your family or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever that,</v>

2481
01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:34.150
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that somebody was talking about.</v>

2482
01:52:34.151 --> 01:52:34.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where?</v>

2483
01:52:34.810 --> 01:52:35.643
<v Speaker 4>Why did Greek philosophy philosophy come</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of grace where they had all that </v>

2484
01:52:39.071 --> 01:52:40.510
<v Speaker 4>time to think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2485
01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:41.433
<v Speaker 4>a lot of like certain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was the historian William </v>

2486
01:52:43.420 --> 01:52:43.811
<v Speaker 4>Mcneil said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2487
01:52:43.811 --> 01:52:46.130
<v Speaker 4>they were able to export timber,</v>
<v Speaker 4>olive oil</v>

2488
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:48.890
<v Speaker 1>and wine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so they made money.</v>

2489
01:52:48.891 --> 01:52:49.724
<v Speaker 1>Their economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could actually have some leisure </v>

2490
01:52:51.141 --> 01:52:51.974
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could buy leisure time because they </v>

2491
01:52:53.991 --> 01:52:55.240
<v Speaker 1>would trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2492
01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:56.083
<v Speaker 1>for all those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those goods that were wanted </v>

2493
01:52:56.991 --> 01:52:59.420
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened was you had,</v>

2494
01:52:59.510 --> 01:53:00.343
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people that made a lot of </v>

2495
01:53:00.891 --> 01:53:04.580
<v Speaker 1>money and they could sit around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>think [inaudible] they could be somebody</v>

2496
01:53:04.581 --> 01:53:05.414
<v Speaker 1>was there to feed them and they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to worry about things that the </v>

2497
01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:09.080
<v Speaker 1>climate was temperate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2498
01:53:09.081 --> 01:53:10.940
<v Speaker 1>so you didn't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're really worried about the winter as</v>

2499
01:53:10.941 --> 01:53:12.140
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it gets cold,</v>

2500
01:53:12.141 --> 01:53:12.974
<v Speaker 1>but not that goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so fascinating because that </v>

2501
01:53:14.181 --> 01:53:16.520
<v Speaker 1>mirrors what John Anthony West said </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Egypt.</v>

2502
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:17.743
<v Speaker 1>He was talking about the early days of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient Egypt and the Nile River being </v>

2503
01:53:21.261 --> 01:53:24.230
<v Speaker 1>such a fertile area and the food just </v>
<v Speaker 1>blew up out of nowhere.</v>

2504
01:53:24.231 --> 01:53:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Like it would just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would just,</v>

2505
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:26.950
<v Speaker 1>it was easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2506
01:53:27.070 --> 01:53:30.350
<v Speaker 1>to grow things also is also animal </v>
<v Speaker 1>grasses that grew.</v>

2507
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that there was barley and there</v>

2508
01:53:32.661 --> 01:53:34.540
<v Speaker 1>was I think millet and there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2509
01:53:34.580 --> 01:53:35.413
<v Speaker 1>that that's a huge factor that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know you could cultivate and the </v>

2510
01:53:37.821 --> 01:53:42.080
<v Speaker 1>natural grasses that just grew anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're also wheat.</v>

2511
01:53:42.380 --> 01:53:43.213
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those were there so you didn't have to </v>

2512
01:53:46.101 --> 01:53:46.934
<v Speaker 1>kind of import them from other places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like we need these kinds of </v>

2513
01:53:50.211 --> 01:53:53.930
<v Speaker 1>situations like these city type </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations where we have massive amounts</v>

2514
01:53:53.931 --> 01:53:54.764
<v Speaker 1>of resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're doing it on a scale that no </v>

2515
01:53:57.891 --> 01:54:00.770
<v Speaker 1>one else has ever done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing on this really bizarre scale</v>

2516
01:54:00.771 --> 01:54:01.604
<v Speaker 1>and we have to recognize that this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>all incredibly recent in terms of like </v>

2517
01:54:04.490 --> 01:54:05.323
<v Speaker 1>human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to jam millions and millions of </v>

2518
01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:08.533
<v Speaker 1>people in cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there had been a few cities in </v>

2519
01:54:09.801 --> 01:54:11.570
<v Speaker 1>China that had done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2520
01:54:11.571 --> 01:54:13.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a few places around the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had done it,</v>

2521
01:54:13.761 --> 01:54:16.520
<v Speaker 1>but they were essentially primitive.</v>

2522
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:17.570
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2523
01:54:17.570 --> 01:54:22.570
<v Speaker 1>like you're talking about what they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done in terms of developing a city where</v>

2524
01:54:23.541 --> 01:54:24.374
<v Speaker 1>it had a million people in the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1200 versus what has to be done in the </v>

2525
01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:29.660
<v Speaker 1>year 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

2526
01:54:29.661 --> 01:54:32.780
<v Speaker 1>you have electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have power everywhere.</v>

2527
01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:35.120
<v Speaker 1>You have sewage lines running </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

2528
01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:36.133
<v Speaker 1>You've got all these people shitting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pissing into tubes and then pumping </v>

2529
01:54:40.101 --> 01:54:44.170
<v Speaker 1>water through this fucking pipe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets rid of it somewhere.</v>

2530
01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:45.980
<v Speaker 1>You got to get rid of all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piss water.</v>

2531
01:54:46.120 --> 01:54:47.420
<v Speaker 1>You've got to figure out a place to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2532
01:54:47.630 --> 01:54:49.280
<v Speaker 1>You've got to have treatment plants for </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2533
01:54:49.610 --> 01:54:50.443
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to bring in truck boron </v>
<v Speaker 1>over bridges and the same places where </v>

2534
01:54:54.981 --> 01:54:55.814
<v Speaker 1>everybody else's and they're filled with</v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens and pigs and fucking and </v>

2535
01:54:59.090 --> 01:54:59.923
<v Speaker 1>cabbage and you just got to constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>just keep bringing them food and bring </v>

2536
01:55:03.021 --> 01:55:03.854
<v Speaker 1>it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

2537
01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:06.110
<v Speaker 1>bringing in their food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing out their shit.</v>

2538
01:55:06.110 --> 01:55:06.943
<v Speaker 1>You know what else that does for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for agricultural communities that the </v>

2539
01:55:09.471 --> 01:55:10.304
<v Speaker 1>benefit for [inaudible] when </v>
<v Speaker 1>agricultural communities we go to war </v>

2540
01:55:12.711 --> 01:55:13.544
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

2541
01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:17.120
<v Speaker 1>a nomadic tribes or with with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exception of the Mongols,</v>

2542
01:55:17.121 --> 01:55:20.450
<v Speaker 1>but with nomadic tribes and other like </v>
<v Speaker 1>native Americans for example,</v>

2543
01:55:20.451 --> 01:55:21.284
<v Speaker 1>is that when you come from a tradition </v>
<v Speaker 1>of agriculture and cities like that </v>

2544
01:55:24.381 --> 01:55:27.920
<v Speaker 1>where you have contact with animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty diseases,</v>

2545
01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:32.960
<v Speaker 1>nasty diseases start to breathe and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build an immunity to it,</v>

2546
01:55:32.991 --> 01:55:35.930
<v Speaker 1>but guess who doesn't?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people you come into contact with.</v>

2547
01:55:36.200 --> 01:55:37.033
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many of the people like the native </v>

2548
01:55:37.971 --> 01:55:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were killed by bullets,</v>

2549
01:55:39.771 --> 01:55:43.800
<v Speaker 1>but they were mainly killed by things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like influenza and the European diseases</v>

2550
01:55:43.801 --> 01:55:44.100
<v Speaker 1>that they</v>

2551
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:46.290
<v Speaker 4>had zero contact with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2552
01:55:46.291 --> 01:55:47.124
<v Speaker 4>that's interesting because a Dan Flores </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote up a paper thing was called bison </v>

2553
01:55:51.871 --> 01:55:54.000
<v Speaker 4>diplomacy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bison ecology.</v>

2554
01:55:54.001 --> 01:55:54.834
<v Speaker 4>Bison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bison Ecology or reading his book right </v>

2555
01:55:56.761 --> 01:55:57.594
<v Speaker 4>now about coyotes and he wrote this book</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the Buffalo and he said that the </v>

2556
01:56:00.811 --> 01:56:04.820
<v Speaker 4>mass numbers that people had seen of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>buffalo when there was,</v>

2557
01:56:04.821 --> 01:56:05.654
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>millions of them roaming across the </v>

2558
01:56:06.481 --> 01:56:07.314
<v Speaker 4>plains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It coincided with the native American </v>

2559
01:56:10.291 --> 01:56:15.180
<v Speaker 4>population dwindling substantially </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of disease by Europeans.</v>

2560
01:56:15.450 --> 01:56:17.970
<v Speaker 4>When the Europeans came over and brought</v>
<v Speaker 4>diseases,</v>

2561
01:56:17.971 --> 01:56:21.270
<v Speaker 4>it wiped out a giant percentage of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>population and he.</v>

2562
01:56:21.300 --> 01:56:23.190
<v Speaker 4>His contention was Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2563
01:56:23.191 --> 01:56:25.140
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who can say yes and French too,</v>

2564
01:56:25.141 --> 01:56:26.730
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was mostly Spanish,</v>

2565
01:56:26.731 --> 01:56:27.930
<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

2566
01:56:27.931 --> 01:56:28.764
<v Speaker 4>Europeans that came over and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>brought a bunch of dirty daddy candy </v>

2567
01:56:31.771 --> 01:56:35.730
<v Speaker 4>bags and their pigs and I'm on also </v>
<v Speaker 4>horses of course,</v>

2568
01:56:35.970 --> 01:56:40.970
<v Speaker 4>but they said he said that the native </v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans with a firearm and with horses</v>

2569
01:56:41.730 --> 01:56:42.563
<v Speaker 4>were already on their way to extra </v>
<v Speaker 4>padding the buffalo from a lot of its </v>

2570
01:56:45.901 --> 01:56:46.734
<v Speaker 4>range before they got hit with these </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy diseases so that when you saw </v>

2571
01:56:51.271 --> 01:56:52.104
<v Speaker 4>these millions of Buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a direct response to a lack of a </v>

2572
01:56:54.481 --> 01:56:55.090
<v Speaker 4>predator.</v>

2573
01:56:55.090 --> 01:56:57.660
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lack of a competent Predator,</v>

2574
01:56:57.720 --> 01:56:58.553
<v Speaker 4>one that they used to have in the native</v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans that would follow them around </v>

2575
01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:03.810
<v Speaker 4>with the native Americans that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>introduced to firearms.</v>

2576
01:57:03.811 --> 01:57:05.950
<v Speaker 4>I believe he was talking about firearms </v>
<v Speaker 4>and um,</v>

2577
01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:08.250
<v Speaker 4>maybe even spears and bows and arrows as</v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

2578
01:57:08.370 --> 01:57:09.203
<v Speaker 4>But the horseback was the big issue </v>
<v Speaker 4>because being on horseback you can just </v>

2579
01:57:11.611 --> 01:57:13.230
<v Speaker 4>get right to the buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just follow.</v>

2580
01:57:13.231 --> 01:57:14.064
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they didn't even know what the fuck </v>

2581
01:57:14.671 --> 01:57:15.750
<v Speaker 4>you were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2582
01:57:15.751 --> 01:57:16.584
<v Speaker 4>they let you get right up on them like </v>
<v Speaker 4>they never got jacked by horses before </v>

2583
01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:20.873
<v Speaker 4>they get jacked by wolves and they got </v>
<v Speaker 4>jacked by mountain lions and they never </v>

2584
01:57:23.491 --> 01:57:26.990
<v Speaker 4>got jacked by a horse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a horse with a dude on it with a fucking</v>

2585
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:32.000
<v Speaker 4>spear of my side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is run up on them and kill him,</v>

2586
01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:33.893
<v Speaker 4>kill a ton of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they would all feast and they </v>

2587
01:57:35.401 --> 01:57:38.430
<v Speaker 4>would follow the buffalo herd around and</v>
<v Speaker 4>just keep jacking him,</v>

2588
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:42.240
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and most likely that this,</v>

2589
01:57:42.241 --> 01:57:43.074
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this Guy Dan Flores is saying that they </v>

2590
01:57:44.911 --> 01:57:48.390
<v Speaker 4>were on their way to diminishing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>population's greatly.</v>

2591
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:52.770
<v Speaker 4>And he points to the early European </v>
<v Speaker 4>travelers who came through.</v>

2592
01:57:53.250 --> 01:57:55.710
<v Speaker 4>They didn't talk about the Buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

2593
01:57:55.730 --> 01:57:56.563
<v Speaker 4>no mention of the Buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They talked about all these other </v>

2594
01:57:57.931 --> 01:57:59.550
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They talked about elk,</v>

2595
01:57:59.551 --> 01:58:01.650
<v Speaker 4>they talked about deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They talked about bear,</v>

2596
01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:02.633
<v Speaker 4>who talked about antelope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They talked about all these plains </v>

2597
01:58:04.291 --> 01:58:06.360
<v Speaker 4>animals that they discovered and </v>
<v Speaker 4>encountered.</v>

2598
01:58:06.361 --> 01:58:09.660
<v Speaker 4>They didn't talk about buffalo from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>From how far back?</v>

2599
01:58:09.661 --> 01:58:12.540
<v Speaker 4>Way Far back when they first started </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming in [inaudible] 91.</v>

2600
01:58:12.541 --> 01:58:13.021
<v Speaker 4>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2601
01:58:13.021 --> 01:58:13.854
<v Speaker 4>so the early settlers accounts did not </v>
<v Speaker 4>include these massive populations of </v>

2602
01:58:18.391 --> 01:58:19.224
<v Speaker 4>Buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when they had gotten to these crazy </v>

2603
01:58:20.791 --> 01:58:23.640
<v Speaker 4>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when they started killing them for.</v>

2604
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:24.743
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of different reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 4>they killed them and one of the reasons </v>

2605
01:58:27.211 --> 01:58:31.020
<v Speaker 4>why they killed him was there for </v>
<v Speaker 4>another one was their tongues.</v>

2606
01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:34.280
<v Speaker 4>They would kill gigantic herds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just thousands of Buffalo.</v>

2607
01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:36.410
<v Speaker 4>They just take their tongues and leave </v>
<v Speaker 4>their bodies to Rye.</v>

2608
01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:38.250
<v Speaker 4>They use their tongues like they ate </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2609
01:58:38.490 --> 01:58:39.330
<v Speaker 4>They were there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A delicate.</v>

2610
01:58:39.331 --> 01:58:39.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was,</v>

2611
01:58:39.850 --> 01:58:42.220
<v Speaker 4>I guess it was valuable at the time</v>

2612
01:58:42.490 --> 01:58:47.490
<v Speaker 1>and they also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used it for the meat market so they</v>

2613
01:58:47.501 --> 01:58:50.890
<v Speaker 1>would kill them and they would take them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they would sell them to market.</v>

2614
01:58:50.891 --> 01:58:51.724
<v Speaker 1>So there were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were market hunters and they were </v>

2615
01:58:52.851 --> 01:58:55.090
<v Speaker 1>just indiscriminately white bow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just giant numbers of them.</v>

2616
01:58:55.091 --> 01:58:58.870
<v Speaker 1>So without a doubt the the native,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the native Americans were on their way.</v>

2617
01:58:58.871 --> 01:58:59.930
<v Speaker 1>But we showed them how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2618
01:59:00.190 --> 01:59:00.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2619
01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:01.533
<v Speaker 1>There are always stories about sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cowboys with their shoulders that were </v>

2620
01:59:04.121 --> 01:59:04.954
<v Speaker 1>black and blue because they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting buffalo all day long and then </v>

2621
01:59:08.951 --> 01:59:09.784
<v Speaker 1>they would take the tarps and stretch </v>
<v Speaker 1>them out and it covered like a square </v>

2622
01:59:13.210 --> 01:59:14.570
<v Speaker 1>mile and some crazy night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that,</v>

2623
01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:15.553
<v Speaker 1>but like football fields of just tarps </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were spread out and then rubbed </v>

2624
01:59:21.251 --> 01:59:22.190
<v Speaker 1>with oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess to make,</v>

2625
01:59:22.191 --> 01:59:23.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the tarp.</v>

2626
01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:25.120
<v Speaker 1>So you created a buffalo skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2627
01:59:25.130 --> 01:59:29.770
<v Speaker 1>hide and at night you'd hear the coyotes</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting and snarling over the,</v>

2628
01:59:29.830 --> 01:59:32.700
<v Speaker 1>sort of the licking the highs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>chewing that the shoe,</v>

2629
01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:33.573
<v Speaker 1>the coyotes away.</v>

2630
01:59:33.730 --> 01:59:34.870
<v Speaker 1>And then they figured out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

2631
01:59:34.871 --> 01:59:37.060
<v Speaker 1>why don't we just lace the buffalo </v>
<v Speaker 1>before we kill him?</v>

2632
01:59:37.070 --> 01:59:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Let's laced the buffalo with strict </v>
<v Speaker 1>nights.</v>

2633
01:59:39.191 --> 01:59:40.024
<v Speaker 1>It will scan them and list the meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the meat with strychnine and </v>

2634
01:59:43.570 --> 01:59:46.060
<v Speaker 1>those animals need the strychnine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll die.</v>

2635
01:59:46.180 --> 01:59:49.060
<v Speaker 1>And then we can take those papers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>send them back east as well.</v>

2636
01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never heard that.</v>

2637
01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What animals were they doing?</v>

2638
01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:52.181
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2639
01:59:52.181 --> 01:59:55.120
<v Speaker 1>so all the boxes would come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the coyotes,</v>

2640
01:59:55.121 --> 01:59:58.540
<v Speaker 1>all the wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all the birds and so they would</v>

2641
01:59:58.541 --> 02:00:02.040
<v Speaker 1>take the feathers and send them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe for hats and they will take the,</v>

2642
02:00:02.070 --> 02:00:02.903
<v Speaker 1>the coyote skins and they take the wolf </v>
<v Speaker 1>skin and everything else that they're </v>

2643
02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:07.570
<v Speaker 1>releasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buffalo meat was trick.</v>

2644
02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a great book that did that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with wild horses.</v>

2645
02:00:10.450 --> 02:00:11.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did that with Buffalo.</v>

2646
02:00:11.531 --> 02:00:13.420
<v Speaker 1>There was a great book called of wolves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and men,</v>

2647
02:00:13.421 --> 02:00:15.310
<v Speaker 1>I believe I read a long time ago.</v>

2648
02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:18.040
<v Speaker 1>And as they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they laid the railroad down,</v>

2649
02:00:18.041 --> 02:00:20.050
<v Speaker 1>they were shooting them from trains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as they,</v>

2650
02:00:20.170 --> 02:00:24.220
<v Speaker 1>as they did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was really what cause the planes of</v>

2651
02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:28.560
<v Speaker 1>the great plains looked very much like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kalahari.</v>

2652
02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:31.180
<v Speaker 1>Apparently like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the African,</v>

2653
02:00:31.181 --> 02:00:32.014
<v Speaker 1>the African wilderness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's funny that you brought that up </v>

2654
02:00:34.121 --> 02:00:35.890
<v Speaker 1>because that's another book the floors </v>
<v Speaker 1>is working on.</v>

2655
02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>He's working on the American Serengeti </v>
<v Speaker 1>Flores gets his fucking information from</v>

2656
02:00:41.590 --> 02:00:43.690
<v Speaker 1>you as a professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're amazing.</v>

2657
02:00:43.691 --> 02:00:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did.</v>

2658
02:00:44.891 --> 02:00:47.720
<v Speaker 1>He taught at a major university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked,</v>

2659
02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:50.590
<v Speaker 1>I worked from Mugu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talked about.</v>

2660
02:00:50.591 --> 02:00:52.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason why the antelope run </v>
<v Speaker 1>so fast,</v>

2661
02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:53.613
<v Speaker 1>so at the antelope run so fast because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were there being chased by these </v>

2662
02:00:55.481 --> 02:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>big cats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we used to have a cat.</v>

2663
02:00:57.521 --> 02:00:58.354
<v Speaker 1>We still have a lion that lived in North</v>
<v Speaker 1>America that's bigger than an African </v>

2664
02:01:00.671 --> 02:01:01.220
<v Speaker 1>lion.</v>

2665
02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2666
02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:05.540
<v Speaker 1>that was a short tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what kind of tail it had.</v>

2667
02:01:05.890 --> 02:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>We had a thing called a short face bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was apparently damn most dangerous</v>

2668
02:01:10.451 --> 02:01:11.284
<v Speaker 1>bear that's ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giant bigger than to bring that up </v>

2669
02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:15.310
<v Speaker 1>bigger than a polar bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2670
02:01:15.311 --> 02:01:16.144
<v Speaker 1>Huge formidable Predator that they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>was one of the reasons why it took so </v>

2671
02:01:19.631 --> 02:01:22.390
<v Speaker 1>long for people to migrate into North </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

2672
02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:23.733
<v Speaker 1>It might have been that the bering </v>
<v Speaker 1>strait was the realm of the short face </v>

2673
02:01:26.651 --> 02:01:28.490
<v Speaker 1>bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want no part of it.</v>

2674
02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Never seen those days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2675
02:01:29.831 --> 02:01:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to see this.</v>

2676
02:01:31.240 --> 02:01:33.580
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the American lion was,</v>

2677
02:01:33.610 --> 02:01:36.940
<v Speaker 1>there was also a thing called a terror </v>
<v Speaker 1>bird that was this giant,</v>

2678
02:01:36.941 --> 02:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>seven foot tall birds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flightless bird with a giant hatchet for</v>

2679
02:01:40.761 --> 02:01:43.070
<v Speaker 1>a face that would just fuck things up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2680
02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:44.173
<v Speaker 1>that is the relative size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's obviously a replica that's the </v>

2681
02:01:47.481 --> 02:01:48.920
<v Speaker 1>size of a short face bear.</v>

2682
02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just an enormous,</v>

2683
02:01:51.111 --> 02:01:53.830
<v Speaker 1>enormous bear and look at that other </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing is that.</v>

2684
02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:57.410
<v Speaker 1>That's a dangerous day at Don Dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dawn,</v>

2685
02:01:57.890 --> 02:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>some other horrible looking monster with</v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth.</v>

2686
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a deer with wolf teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2687
02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a hedgehog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2688
02:02:04.161 --> 02:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a buffalo,</v>

2689
02:02:05.301 --> 02:02:06.710
<v Speaker 1>which I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy fucking pig.</v>

2690
02:02:07.300 --> 02:02:09.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God Damn Man.</v>

2691
02:02:09.470 --> 02:02:12.020
<v Speaker 1>There were some crazy fucking animals I </v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

2692
02:02:12.021 --> 02:02:12.854
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of that was really interesting is </v>

2693
02:02:14.481 --> 02:02:19.370
<v Speaker 1>that the massive them went extinct </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around the end of the ice age.</v>

2694
02:02:19.371 --> 02:02:20.204
<v Speaker 1>They just all got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll probably for the same reason why </v>

2695
02:02:21.921 --> 02:02:24.470
<v Speaker 1>the ice age and probably a lot of shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

2696
02:02:24.590 --> 02:02:26.450
<v Speaker 1>A lot of factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how big it is.</v>

2697
02:02:26.990 --> 02:02:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's impressive.</v>

2698
02:02:29.290 --> 02:02:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Look at the size of that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just a Kodiak bear.</v>

2699
02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:36.770
<v Speaker 1>I could easily be a Kodiak that easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>kept their 11 feet high or some shit.</v>

2700
02:02:36.770 --> 02:02:38.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big ones are.</v>

2701
02:02:38.410 --> 02:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2702
02:02:39.621 --> 02:02:41.960
<v Speaker 1>There's a great video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to shit your pants.</v>

2703
02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:47.060
<v Speaker 1>It a great video from a guard booth in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alaska where these guys are inside,</v>

2704
02:02:47.061 --> 02:02:47.894
<v Speaker 1>like one of those part ranger guard </v>
<v Speaker 1>booths and they're watching this bear </v>

2705
02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:52.063
<v Speaker 1>walkthrough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the size of a bus complete is a </v>

2706
02:02:54.381 --> 02:02:55.214
<v Speaker 1>fucking tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a few like a VW bus and </v>

2707
02:02:58.221 --> 02:02:59.240
<v Speaker 1>and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in there and go,</v>

2708
02:02:59.241 --> 02:03:00.110
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at him,</v>

2709
02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:00.771
<v Speaker 1>look at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at him,</v>

2710
02:03:00.771 --> 02:03:01.604
<v Speaker 1>look at him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the thing just strolls right past </v>

2711
02:03:03.471 --> 02:03:07.370
<v Speaker 1>the guard booth and you get a sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're inside this building,</v>

2712
02:03:07.371 --> 02:03:09.710
<v Speaker 1>but the building is only 10 feet from </v>
<v Speaker 1>this animal.</v>

2713
02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:10.633
<v Speaker 1>So you get like a really clear sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion of how big it is and you're </v>

2714
02:03:13.731 --> 02:03:15.140
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

2715
02:03:15.141 --> 02:03:15.974
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like 11 feet long and it probably </v>

2716
02:03:18.261 --> 02:03:18.920
<v Speaker 1>weighs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2717
02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:20.330
<v Speaker 1>who knows how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many,</v>

2718
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:20.990
<v Speaker 1>how much do I have?</v>

2719
02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen hundred pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never,</v>

2720
02:03:22.480 --> 02:03:25.760
<v Speaker 1>you feel such a good way to feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>food and shoes.</v>

2721
02:03:25.761 --> 02:03:29.720
<v Speaker 1>You're so demeaning of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why going to zoos makes me always</v>

2722
02:03:29.721 --> 02:03:34.430
<v Speaker 1>feel a little shitty about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the weakest link in the chain.</v>

2723
02:03:34.431 --> 02:03:38.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a ball pink piece of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

2724
02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:39.883
<v Speaker 1>I suck compared to your guns and cars </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit that's brain and figured it </v>

2725
02:03:43.611 --> 02:03:45.380
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you see this thing,</v>

2726
02:03:45.670 --> 02:03:48.890

<v Speaker 1>No bear giant bear walks.</v>

2727
02:03:48.891 --> 02:03:51.860

2729
02:03:55.371 --> 02:03:58.160
<v Speaker 1>you're eaten by a bear because bears </v>
<v Speaker 1>just start eating you and you're alive.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They don't want to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they want you to die so they could </v>

2733
02:04:04.471 --> 02:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yuck.</v>

2734
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:06.343
<v Speaker 1>Bears are so vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't feel the need to kill you </v>

2735
02:04:08.181 --> 02:04:08.900
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

2736
02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:10.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just hold you down.</v>

2737
02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch this.</v>

2738
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:15.200
<v Speaker 1>So these guys around the guard booth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing starts.</v>

2739
02:04:15.201 --> 02:04:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Lumbering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tourism.</v>

2740
02:04:17.170 --> 02:04:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so big.</v>

2741
02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:20.960
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the name of it?</v>

2742
02:04:20.961 --> 02:04:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Jamie says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>must see huge brown bear walking pass.</v>

2743
02:04:24.860 --> 02:04:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Brooks Lodge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ranger station.</v>

2744
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:29.290
<v Speaker 1>So as these guys are sitting there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their truck like,</v>

2745
02:04:29.291 --> 02:04:33.060
<v Speaker 1>look how close it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was on the road doing these.</v>

2746
02:04:33.270 --> 02:04:35.720
<v Speaker 1>These guys are stand there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch out walks right by there.</v>

2747
02:04:35.721 --> 02:04:40.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean that things tend to fade away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>

2748
02:04:40.890 --> 02:04:41.723
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't even swear and they're so </v>

2749
02:04:42.961 --> 02:04:44.890
<v Speaker 1>nice up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at that.</v>

2750
02:04:45.940 --> 02:04:46.800
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch this.</v>

2751
02:04:46.801 --> 02:04:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Look at the lady walking down the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See down there.</v>

2752
02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:54.150
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A dude might be a dude.</v>

2753
02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:55.073
<v Speaker 1>So let's say lady might be a lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but either way it just decides not to </v>

2754
02:04:58.591 --> 02:05:00.990
<v Speaker 1>walk over and eat her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she's just out there.</v>

2755
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:04.230
<v Speaker 1>If it went into a dead sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be around.</v>

2756
02:05:04.330 --> 02:05:05.370
<v Speaker 1>It's catching her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2757
02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:06.233
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never getting away from that thing </v>

2758
02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:09.810
<v Speaker 1>and that she didn't even see that bear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2759
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:11.143
<v Speaker 1>She would have heard it coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would have heard of breathing </v>

2760
02:05:12.361 --> 02:05:13.194
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

2761
02:05:14.890 --> 02:05:15.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what it would've done if we'd </v>

2762
02:05:16.531 --> 02:05:19.140
<v Speaker 1>have checked to see if she had a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

2763
02:05:19.141 --> 02:05:19.974
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't eat in her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what it like just run up to her </v>

2764
02:05:21.901 --> 02:05:22.734
<v Speaker 1>and eating her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the thing they say about </v>

2765
02:05:23.851 --> 02:05:24.684
<v Speaker 1>grizzlies is it's way less likely that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>grizzly bear is going to kill you for </v>

2766
02:05:28.231 --> 02:05:29.064
<v Speaker 1>food and wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More likely they're going to kill you </v>

2767
02:05:30.751 --> 02:05:31.584
<v Speaker 1>because you stumble upon a mother with </v>
<v Speaker 1>her cubs and she's protecting her </v>

2768
02:05:33.970 --> 02:05:36.690
<v Speaker 1>because grizzly bears don't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at people's food,</v>

2769
02:05:36.720 --> 02:05:37.553
<v Speaker 1>but black bear apparently are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunistic predators and there's way </v>

2770
02:05:40.951 --> 02:05:45.210
<v Speaker 1>more way more incidents of black bears </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking and killing people for food.</v>

2771
02:05:45.810 --> 02:05:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Then there is a of grizzly bears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grizzly bears definitely have done it,</v>

2772
02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:53.640
<v Speaker 1>but it appears that a black bears do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>more for food more for predation.</v>

2773
02:05:53.820 --> 02:05:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Brunello was telling us about a story </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2774
02:05:56.101 --> 02:05:58.350
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Running up to a dog.</v>

2775
02:05:59.550 --> 02:06:02.490
<v Speaker 1>It scared that a dog is a that's from </v>
<v Speaker 1>American Werewolf in London.</v>

2776
02:06:02.940 --> 02:06:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Video ended right as a set of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were filming it.</v>

2777
02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2778
02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:09.570
<v Speaker 1>because they were fucking with says mom </v>
<v Speaker 1>Barrett tax.</v>

2779
02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2780
02:06:10.831 --> 02:06:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to say that.</v>

2781
02:06:14.790 --> 02:06:16.380
<v Speaker 1>It is A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

2782
02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:18.720
<v Speaker 1>bears scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Good.</v>

2783
02:06:18.810 --> 02:06:19.643
<v Speaker 1>Don't get eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was telling a story about a </v>

2784
02:06:21.511 --> 02:06:22.630
<v Speaker 1>friend of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

2785
02:06:22.700 --> 02:06:24.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fuck the story up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

2786
02:06:24.510 --> 02:06:25.200
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2787
02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:26.033
<v Speaker 1>I think that just the story was they </v>
<v Speaker 1>took this guy out for the first time </v>

2788
02:06:28.441 --> 02:06:31.830
<v Speaker 1>hunting ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got attacked by a 500 pound predatory</v>

2789
02:06:31.831 --> 02:06:34.820
<v Speaker 1>black bear in his tent while he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping.</v>

2790
02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Bear comes in the tent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mauls him.</v>

2791
02:06:36.690 --> 02:06:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Somebody wakes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoots the bear,</v>

2792
02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:41.670
<v Speaker 1>hits him in the wrist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks his wrist,</v>

2793
02:06:41.730 --> 02:06:42.563
<v Speaker 1>and then the bear gets out of that tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>runs in another tent and they shoot it </v>

2794
02:06:46.050 --> 02:06:49.170
<v Speaker 1>500 pound predatory black bear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a bear.</v>

2795
02:06:49.171 --> 02:06:53.400
<v Speaker 1>That's how much you weigh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One 71 72,</v>

2796
02:06:53.401 --> 02:06:54.234
<v Speaker 1>shred it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm somewhere in the range of 200 </v>

2797
02:06:56.551 --> 02:07:00.660
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you and I and then a lot more.</v>

2798
02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:01.553
<v Speaker 1>Another 100 plus pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another 125 pounds and it's a fucking </v>

2799
02:07:04.081 --> 02:07:06.740
<v Speaker 1>bear and you're by yourself and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping.</v>

2800
02:07:06.750 --> 02:07:10.290
<v Speaker 1>It's your first time ever hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing comes through the door.</v>

2801
02:07:10.530 --> 02:07:15.530
<v Speaker 1>Just all hot fucking funk breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never taken a bath in it's life.</v>

2802
02:07:16.430 --> 02:07:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Just looking to rip you apart while you </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast twitch muscle and dense bone.</v>

2803
02:07:20.730 --> 02:07:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Your friend shoots you in the wrist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your friend shoots at it,</v>

2804
02:07:23.551 --> 02:07:24.384
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if it got a pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>through and the the the bear's body and </v>

2805
02:07:27.271 --> 02:07:29.520
<v Speaker 1>then hit him because that sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens,</v>

2806
02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:31.380
<v Speaker 1>but either way you get shot in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrist.</v>

2807
02:07:31.850 --> 02:07:32.683
<v Speaker 1>Bear mauls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were talking about how the new it </v>

2808
02:07:34.290 --> 02:07:36.670
<v Speaker 1>used to kill seals and they would use</v>

2809
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:39.460
<v Speaker 3>polar bear bone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2810
02:07:39.610 --> 02:07:42.670
<v Speaker 3>how do you kill a polar bear?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know how,</v>

2811
02:07:43.050 --> 02:07:44.990
<v Speaker 3>but I know how to killed wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2812
02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:45.833
<v Speaker 3>they used to kill wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether used to take a blade and put </v>

2813
02:07:47.410 --> 02:07:50.010
<v Speaker 3>blood on it and it was just keep looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>and bleed today,</v>

2814
02:07:50.530 --> 02:07:53.890
<v Speaker 3>but I believe with polar bears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would kill them missile.</v>

2815
02:07:53.891 --> 02:07:57.190
<v Speaker 3>When they were sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was find out where they were sleeping</v>

2816
02:07:57.640 --> 02:07:58.473
<v Speaker 3>and they would come in there and stabbed</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shit out of them while they were </v>

2817
02:08:01.121 --> 02:08:03.320
<v Speaker 3>sleeping and then they would take that </v>
<v Speaker 3>box.</v>

2818
02:08:03.330 --> 02:08:04.163
<v Speaker 3>It was extra hard and they would put at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the end of their spirit and that's how </v>

2819
02:08:06.281 --> 02:08:10.060
<v Speaker 3>they would kill seals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever wonder how inuits who lived</v>

2820
02:08:10.061 --> 02:08:13.840
<v Speaker 3>in that ice region got water?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because remember what the water is,</v>

2821
02:08:13.841 --> 02:08:15.050
<v Speaker 3>it's all saltwater,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2822
02:08:15.310 --> 02:08:18.280
<v Speaker 3>Ice Is all salt water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how do you get water?</v>

2823
02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:20.860
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck you get water is polar </v>
<v Speaker 3>bears Dick.</v>

2824
02:08:21.130 --> 02:08:22.150
<v Speaker 3>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2825
02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:23.230
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yes,</v>

2826
02:08:23.231 --> 02:08:25.780
<v Speaker 3>most of the time you're not very </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientific.</v>

2827
02:08:26.170 --> 02:08:27.550
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do I am okay.</v>

2828
02:08:27.610 --> 02:08:28.443
<v Speaker 3>But you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently they would be able to see </v>

2829
02:08:30.371 --> 02:08:34.240
<v Speaker 3>what the old guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the old old ice by the color of it,</v>

2830
02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:36.310
<v Speaker 3>the older the ice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2831
02:08:36.311 --> 02:08:38.560
<v Speaker 3>I guess the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the less salt.</v>

2832
02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:39.633
<v Speaker 3>So you would find really old ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the ice that you would </v>

2833
02:08:41.771 --> 02:08:43.840
<v Speaker 3>meltdown as water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's the fuck?</v>

2834
02:08:43.870 --> 02:08:44.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

2835
02:08:44.770 --> 02:08:49.160
<v Speaker 3>the Arctic explorers who didn't hook up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the inuit always died.</v>

2836
02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:52.200
<v Speaker 3>They just froze to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't,</v>

2837
02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:54.100
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't find food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sucked.</v>

2838
02:08:54.370 --> 02:08:57.380
<v Speaker 3>And the ones that immediately made </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends with the nun,</v>

2839
02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:58.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2840
02:08:58.700 --> 02:08:59.533
<v Speaker 3>they came back nice and fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had plenty of seal meat and they </v>

2841
02:09:03.131 --> 02:09:03.964
<v Speaker 3>would always have to get rid of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>their clothing and where exactly what </v>

2842
02:09:06.521 --> 02:09:07.354
<v Speaker 3>the intuit would wear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of a fucking crazy person </v>

2843
02:09:10.270 --> 02:09:11.860
<v Speaker 3>decides to go to the Antarctic.</v>

2844
02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:13.233
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the British who wanted to find a </v>

2845
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:15.303
<v Speaker 3>different way routes from trade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just think about what kind of a </v>

2846
02:09:17.561 --> 02:09:19.470
<v Speaker 3>crazy person and you feel like that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>what I want to do this.</v>

2847
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:21.460
<v Speaker 3>I want to go home and be the first guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go to Antarctica.</v>

2848
02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:25.000
<v Speaker 3>Bad asses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna walk across that frozen.</v>

2849
02:09:25.260 --> 02:09:28.250
<v Speaker 3>It looks like nothing that had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Messiness,</v>

2850
02:09:28.330 --> 02:09:30.050
<v Speaker 3>that story about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the name,</v>

2851
02:09:30.090 --> 02:09:33.050
<v Speaker 3>wasn't shackleton was another guy who </v>
<v Speaker 3>was an explorer and he,</v>

2852
02:09:33.051 --> 02:09:33.884
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his men were all starving and dying and </v>

2853
02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:37.750
<v Speaker 3>he knew he was going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was a British Aristocrat,</v>

2854
02:09:37.800 --> 02:09:38.181
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2855
02:09:38.181 --> 02:09:40.120
<v Speaker 3>and when you were in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had a duty,</v>

2856
02:09:40.450 --> 02:09:41.283
<v Speaker 3>you've got a duty to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to essentially use your free time to </v>

2857
02:09:44.051 --> 02:09:45.790
<v Speaker 3>make the world a better place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2858
02:09:45.791 --> 02:09:49.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he famously stiff upper lip,</v>

2859
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:51.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grew up on a life of discipline,</v>

2860
02:09:51.190 --> 02:09:52.023
<v Speaker 3>never showing every your emotions </v>
<v Speaker 3>properly carted away to boarding school </v>

2861
02:09:54.941 --> 02:09:56.890
<v Speaker 3>at six years old as they always were.</v>

2862
02:09:57.580 --> 02:09:59.520
<v Speaker 3>Definitely did some buggery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2863
02:09:59.550 --> 02:10:00.460
<v Speaker 3>as to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2864
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:01.840
<v Speaker 3>That was real common.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still is,</v>

2865
02:10:02.170 --> 02:10:03.003
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the opera class to send their kids to </v>

2866
02:10:04.211 --> 02:10:06.220
<v Speaker 3>school at seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the older classmates and like,</v>

2867
02:10:06.221 --> 02:10:08.170
<v Speaker 3>hey jay stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of problems.</v>

2868
02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:09.280
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2869
02:10:09.281 --> 02:10:11.220
<v Speaker 3>he said famously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2870
02:10:12.130 --> 02:10:13.960
<v Speaker 3>as he knew he was going to die his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his foot,</v>

2871
02:10:13.961 --> 02:10:16.690
<v Speaker 3>apparently it was gangrene and he looked</v>
<v Speaker 3>at his men and he said,</v>

2872
02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:21.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm going for a walk and they may be </v>
<v Speaker 3>some time and he just,</v>

2873
02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:24.910
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just rather than convenience and with</v>

2874
02:10:24.911 --> 02:10:25.744
<v Speaker 3>his death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that would be very unblemish he </v>

2875
02:10:27.551 --> 02:10:32.410
<v Speaker 3>walked off and frozen stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a bad ass because,</v>

2876
02:10:32.650 --> 02:10:33.483
<v Speaker 3>because keeping up and if you read some </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the letters as they were dying and </v>

2877
02:10:35.871 --> 02:10:36.704
<v Speaker 3>starving to death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their letters are incredibly formal and </v>

2878
02:10:39.111 --> 02:10:39.944
<v Speaker 3>still poised and always taking into </v>
<v Speaker 3>account that they had to keep up </v>

2879
02:10:43.941 --> 02:10:44.774
<v Speaker 3>appearances and that they had to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>always remind themselves that they were </v>

2880
02:10:48.081 --> 02:10:48.914
<v Speaker 3>there for a bigger cause and that their </v>
<v Speaker 3>personal discomfort was just not </v>

2881
02:10:51.981 --> 02:10:53.650
<v Speaker 3>something you inconvenience anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

2882
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:54.583
<v Speaker 4>That was the highest level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilization they will capable of </v>

2883
02:10:57.591 --> 02:10:58.424
<v Speaker 4>expressing before emojis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See now you could send someone a text </v>

2884
02:11:02.541 --> 02:11:03.374
<v Speaker 4>message and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the dis dis shit is going </v>

2885
02:11:07.171 --> 02:11:07.860
<v Speaker 4>to work out.</v>

2886
02:11:07.860 --> 02:11:08.693
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the piece out if you want to sell fam </v>

2887
02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:11.873
<v Speaker 3>and then you'd have like an Emoji with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>peace sign and then like you and then a </v>

2888
02:11:14.851 --> 02:11:18.270
<v Speaker 3>gun dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to see the antithesis to the</v>

2889
02:11:18.271 --> 02:11:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Emoji and the American culture as it is </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2890
02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:24.810
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Youtube a debate between James Baldwin,</v>

2891
02:11:24.811 --> 02:11:25.644
<v Speaker 3>the Great African American author and </v>
<v Speaker 3>William F Buckley at Cambridge </v>

2892
02:11:29.610 --> 02:11:30.443
<v Speaker 3>University in 1965.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody who's listening please do </v>

2893
02:11:33.361 --> 02:11:34.194
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just set up to do with emojis just </v>

2894
02:11:35.821 --> 02:11:36.654
<v Speaker 3>because that was debate and language and</v>
<v Speaker 3>formality and hieroglyphs and cadres </v>

2895
02:11:41.590 --> 02:11:42.151
<v Speaker 3>goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all,</v>

2896
02:11:42.151 --> 02:11:43.530
<v Speaker 3>they're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2897
02:11:43.531 --> 02:11:43.950
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2898
02:11:43.950 --> 02:11:44.783
<v Speaker 3>the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it was the American dream at the </v>

2899
02:11:47.941 --> 02:11:50.700
<v Speaker 3>expense of the American Negro or does it</v>
<v Speaker 3>not?</v>

2900
02:11:50.701 --> 02:11:52.770
<v Speaker 3>And that is the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Ms Dot Buckley was close.</v>

2901
02:11:52.830 --> 02:11:55.740
<v Speaker 3>Choose that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not an Mr Ronald Reagan's visit.</v>

2902
02:11:55.741 --> 02:11:56.574
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And James Bond gets him a rousing </v>

2903
02:11:58.051 --> 02:11:59.310
<v Speaker 3>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 65.</v>

2904
02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:04.640
<v Speaker 3>I brought the cotton to market and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>picked the cotton for nothing,</v>

2905
02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:06.233
<v Speaker 3>for nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would always be an inevitable and </v>

2906
02:12:09.571 --> 02:12:11.030
<v Speaker 3>then William Buckley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets up and.</v>

2907
02:12:11.130 --> 02:12:11.963
<v Speaker 3>But the formality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the theatricality and the fucking </v>

2908
02:12:14.971 --> 02:12:15.804
<v Speaker 3>language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way English was spoken by the upper </v>

2909
02:12:17.701 --> 02:12:19.830
<v Speaker 3>classes are the educated back in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

2910
02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:21.480
<v Speaker 3>This is so great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's 12 years old.</v>

2911
02:12:21.540 --> 02:12:21.901
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2912
02:12:21.901 --> 02:12:26.901
<v Speaker 3>That's not the beginning of that bait </v>
<v Speaker 3>flowing dresses for university.</v>

2913
02:12:27.101 --> 02:12:27.820
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2914
02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:30.600
<v Speaker 3>And fast forward to James Baldwin </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>

2915
02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:32.330
<v Speaker 3>It's actually quite amazing.</v>

2916
02:12:32.630 --> 02:12:36.020
<v Speaker 4>We can't really play it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll get yanked off of youtube.</v>

2917
02:12:36.630 --> 02:12:38.930
<v Speaker 4>That's somebody else's content that </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody else owns us.</v>

2918
02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:40.760
<v Speaker 4>It's really important to watch though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

2919
02:12:41.280 --> 02:12:44.300
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was my though was that.</v>

2920
02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:45.283
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that the reason why that </v>
<v Speaker 4>formality was so appreciated and </v>

2921
02:12:48.381 --> 02:12:49.214
<v Speaker 4>accepted and it was so highly regarded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was because that was the highest level </v>

2922
02:12:53.031 --> 02:12:55.640
<v Speaker 4>of civilization that they had before </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology,</v>

2923
02:12:55.940 --> 02:12:56.773
<v Speaker 4>before technology and before being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a limited amount that you can </v>

2924
02:12:59.091 --> 02:13:02.480
<v Speaker 4>influence the environment back then and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could have more influence yourself.</v>

2925
02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:04.350
<v Speaker 4>You could more educate yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could,</v>

2926
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:06.500
<v Speaker 4>if you wanted to go somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to get on a boat.</v>

2927
02:13:06.820 --> 02:13:07.653
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to get on a boat with everybody </v>

2928
02:13:08.331 --> 02:13:09.680
<v Speaker 4>else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had to get on a train.</v>

2929
02:13:09.681 --> 02:13:11.540
<v Speaker 4>If you want to get across the country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had to get on the train.</v>

2930
02:13:11.810 --> 02:13:12.643
<v Speaker 4>If you want to write something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you had to use a quill and you had to </v>

2931
02:13:14.661 --> 02:13:15.494
<v Speaker 4>have a little thing of ink and yet a dip</v>
<v Speaker 4>it in there and that's how he wrote </v>

2932
02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:22.100
<v Speaker 4>period and it was a limited amount that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could do.</v>

2933
02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:23.173
<v Speaker 4>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't just go home and sit and </v>

2934
02:13:24.051 --> 02:13:26.530
<v Speaker 4>watch television.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't a code,</v>

2935
02:13:26.531 --> 02:13:29.870
<v Speaker 4>a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says less distraction.</v>

2936
02:13:29.930 --> 02:13:30.763
<v Speaker 4>There's less distraction and the the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the level of ability that you could </v>

2937
02:13:35.570 --> 02:13:38.820
<v Speaker 4>where you could express civilization at </v>
<v Speaker 4>its highest level.</v>

2938
02:13:38.821 --> 02:13:42.570
<v Speaker 4>It was basically like code a few </v>
<v Speaker 4>machines that people had built,</v>

2939
02:13:42.870 --> 02:13:45.240
<v Speaker 4>a few combustion machines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the trains,</v>

2940
02:13:45.241 --> 02:13:46.074
<v Speaker 4>things along those lines and then the </v>
<v Speaker 4>rest of it was just like houses and </v>

2941
02:13:49.531 --> 02:13:50.364
<v Speaker 4>rule.</v>

2942
02:13:50.830 --> 02:13:53.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's accurate.</v>

2943
02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:54.153
<v Speaker 3>I think it might also be that I like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's part of it and I think </v>

2944
02:13:57.491 --> 02:14:00.880
<v Speaker 3>that's a valid kind of a description of </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe part of what was going on,</v>

2945
02:14:00.881 --> 02:14:02.440
<v Speaker 3>but I think something else is going on </v>
<v Speaker 3>with those,</v>

2946
02:14:02.470 --> 02:14:03.303
<v Speaker 3>with those debates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that when you the reason like </v>

2947
02:14:05.651 --> 02:14:08.410
<v Speaker 3>something like firing line watch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>firing line with William F Buckley,</v>

2948
02:14:08.411 --> 02:14:10.180
<v Speaker 3>popular show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's molasses.</v>

2949
02:14:10.181 --> 02:14:11.050
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to read.</v>

2950
02:14:11.100 --> 02:14:15.010
<v Speaker 3>You're listening to men speak about long</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

2951
02:14:15.570 --> 02:14:16.403
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I really appreciate </v>

2952
02:14:16.721 --> 02:14:17.554
<v Speaker 3>about your show because you're having </v>
<v Speaker 3>such smart people on having real </v>

2953
02:14:18.821 --> 02:14:19.654
<v Speaker 3>discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then how the fuck did you get on </v>

2954
02:14:20.651 --> 02:14:24.720
<v Speaker 3>here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what barn,</v>

2955
02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:29.780
<v Speaker 3>but I think he got me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fucking got me again,</v>

2956
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:35.380
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But back then like there was.</v>

2957
02:14:35.410 --> 02:14:36.243
<v Speaker 3>It feels like political commitment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>winning these arguments between right </v>

2958
02:14:40.241 --> 02:14:44.270
<v Speaker 3>and left as they were known had actual </v>
<v Speaker 3>ramifications because the.</v>

2959
02:14:44.530 --> 02:14:45.363
<v Speaker 3>It feels like politics and whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens in an election today means less </v>

2960
02:14:50.111 --> 02:14:50.944
<v Speaker 3>to people and has less of an effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least an immediate effect because </v>

2961
02:14:55.601 --> 02:14:57.970
<v Speaker 3>back in those days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>65,</v>

2962
02:14:58.300 --> 02:14:59.133
<v Speaker 3>the wars that were going on with </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology and wars with fascism and </v>

2963
02:15:02.441 --> 02:15:03.274
<v Speaker 3>communism and capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were actually dying and having </v>

2964
02:15:07.061 --> 02:15:07.894
<v Speaker 3>real wars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were national awards that were set </v>

2965
02:15:11.141 --> 02:15:15.100
<v Speaker 3>to defend not only resources but those </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologies and entire movement,</v>

2966
02:15:15.250 --> 02:15:18.850
<v Speaker 3>and I think that there was the sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>that if this side wins,</v>

2967
02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:22.450
<v Speaker 3>then that side of it is going to come </v>
<v Speaker 3>over and take us over.</v>

2968
02:15:22.451 --> 02:15:23.284
<v Speaker 3>There was this real ideology between </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and so I think that those debates </v>

2969
02:15:27.130 --> 02:15:27.963
<v Speaker 3>people took very personally because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably knew somebody who died </v>

2970
02:15:31.211 --> 02:15:32.044
<v Speaker 3>defending the world against fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were afraid of the red scare or </v>

2971
02:15:36.551 --> 02:15:37.384
<v Speaker 3>they were committed communists and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were being persecuted for it because </v>

2972
02:15:39.941 --> 02:15:42.250
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't get a job in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a real,</v>

2973
02:15:42.410 --> 02:15:43.243
<v Speaker 3>a culture war that had actual tangible </v>
<v Speaker 3>ramifications that you could see every </v>

2974
02:15:47.530 --> 02:15:48.363
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My God,</v>

2975
02:15:48.370 --> 02:15:49.203
<v Speaker 3>the Vietnam War,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Americans were dying every day because </v>

2976
02:15:51.401 --> 02:15:52.234
<v Speaker 3>there were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were sent out there to make the </v>

2977
02:15:52.841 --> 02:15:54.590
<v Speaker 3>world safe for democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2978
02:15:54.670 --> 02:15:57.370
<v Speaker 4>That was a factor too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that was not a factor.</v>

2979
02:15:57.371 --> 02:15:59.440
<v Speaker 4>I think there certainly was a lot going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on there with that,</v>

2980
02:15:59.441 --> 02:16:01.810
<v Speaker 4>but we were really talking about people </v>
<v Speaker 4>even before that era.</v>

2981
02:16:02.180 --> 02:16:03.013
<v Speaker 4>I think when we were talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy from Antarctica that I'm going out </v>

2982
02:16:07.331 --> 02:16:09.420
<v Speaker 4>for a walk maybe some times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2983
02:16:10.180 --> 02:16:15.180
<v Speaker 4>I think there was something with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectuals of the day where they were</v>

2984
02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:16.263
<v Speaker 4>way more uncorrupted by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the world that we live in today in </v>

2985
02:16:21.131 --> 02:16:21.964
<v Speaker 4>terms of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You mean like they had a sense of duty </v>

2986
02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:26.200
<v Speaker 4>and I think there was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a very,</v>

2987
02:16:26.590 --> 02:16:27.423
<v Speaker 4>very important position,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right to be the who disseminated the </v>

2988
02:16:30.281 --> 02:16:34.690
<v Speaker 4>information in 17,</v>
<v Speaker 4>95 made decisions and made decisions and</v>

2989
02:16:34.691 --> 02:16:38.200
<v Speaker 4>was in charge of like libraries and </v>
<v Speaker 4>books and it was teaching universities.</v>

2990
02:16:38.201 --> 02:16:39.034
<v Speaker 4>I mean you've got to think of like what </v>
<v Speaker 4>different British universities were </v>

2991
02:16:41.111 --> 02:16:43.000
<v Speaker 4>around the 17 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like quite a few,</v>

2992
02:16:43.001 --> 02:16:43.834
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2993
02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:44.733
<v Speaker 4>I bet you could name like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like isn't Yale for the seventh when </v>

2994
02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:53.160
<v Speaker 4>yell was founded in late,</v>
<v Speaker 4>late 17 or I think Harvard as well,</v>

2995
02:16:53.891 --> 02:16:57.650
<v Speaker 4>or at least I think didn't Thomas </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jefferson wrote about a Cambridge,</v>

2996
02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:58.833
<v Speaker 4>Cambridge Oxford didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think Isaac Newton went to Oxford </v>

2997
02:17:03.090 --> 02:17:04.040
<v Speaker 4>gala.</v>
<v Speaker 4>17,</v>

2998
02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:05.710
<v Speaker 4>17,</v>
<v Speaker 4>11.</v>

2999
02:17:05.740 --> 02:17:06.970
<v Speaker 4>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Incredible.</v>

3000
02:17:06.971 --> 02:17:07.804
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like back then raising and that was </v>

3001
02:17:10.481 --> 02:17:12.460
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you think of let's just go to 17.</v>

3002
02:17:12.461 --> 02:17:13.600
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one in 17,</v>

3003
02:17:13.660 --> 02:17:14.493
<v Speaker 4>11,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the intellectuals with the highest </v>

3004
02:17:15.701 --> 02:17:16.534
<v Speaker 4>expression of civilization because there</v>
<v Speaker 4>really wasn't that much technological </v>

3005
02:17:20.261 --> 02:17:21.094
<v Speaker 4>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There really wasn't that much that had </v>

3006
02:17:22.241 --> 02:17:24.070
<v Speaker 4>been done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's where there was guns,</v>

3007
02:17:24.071 --> 02:17:24.904
<v Speaker 4>there was some machines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know they even have a </v>

3008
02:17:26.411 --> 02:17:28.510
<v Speaker 4>printing press.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe they did in 17.</v>

3009
02:17:28.511 --> 02:17:29.110
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

3010
02:17:29.110 --> 02:17:31.990
<v Speaker 4>When was the dependent printing presses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with added,</v>

3011
02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:33.733
<v Speaker 4>was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3012
02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:34.301
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

3013
02:17:34.301 --> 02:17:35.920
<v Speaker 4>That's when Martin Luther was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3014
02:17:36.030 --> 02:17:37.540
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had a printing press back then.</v>

3015
02:17:37.590 --> 02:17:38.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3016
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:39.580
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's his name?</v>

3017
02:17:40.850 --> 02:17:42.670
<v Speaker 4>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who invented the printing press?</v>

3018
02:17:42.671 --> 02:17:45.010
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I'm forgetting this or </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly didn't have typewriters.</v>

3019
02:17:45.340 --> 02:17:47.740
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd have to type face things.</v>

3020
02:17:47.770 --> 02:17:50.530
<v Speaker 4>So they would probably read off </v>
<v Speaker 4>manuscripts in schools.</v>

3021
02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:53.050
<v Speaker 4>So like when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they were in schools and they would</v>

3022
02:17:53.051 --> 02:17:55.060
<v Speaker 4>write,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they interpreted.</v>

3023
02:17:55.470 --> 02:17:57.370
<v Speaker 4>Did they have typewriters printing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>press.</v>

3024
02:17:57.371 --> 02:17:59.800
<v Speaker 4>Gutenberg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What year was the typewriter?</v>

3025
02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:05.170
<v Speaker 4>Probably back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's what's crazy about it all.</v>

3026
02:18:05.290 --> 02:18:06.123
<v Speaker 4>This is something that I've been talking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about on stage is a how recent all that </v>

3027
02:18:09.611 --> 02:18:10.660
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems,</v>

3028
02:18:10.780 --> 02:18:15.760
<v Speaker 4>it seems so far away for us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this is the way I describe it,</v>

3029
02:18:15.940 --> 02:18:18.700
<v Speaker 4>like people live to be 100,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's 300 years ago.</v>

3030
02:18:18.701 --> 02:18:23.410
<v Speaker 4>It's three people crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's three people go whoa.</v>

3031
02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:24.573
<v Speaker 4>Thirteen years there with 17,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they had 13 years of no typewriters </v>

3032
02:18:27.610 --> 02:18:28.443
<v Speaker 4>and then written by scrawls things with </v>
<v Speaker 4>sell written by Inc and I'm sure you </v>

3033
02:18:32.291 --> 02:18:33.124
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it took a long time for that diffusion </v>

3034
02:18:33.731 --> 02:18:37.600
<v Speaker 4>of that innovation when you think the </v>
<v Speaker 4>typewriter really like totally kicked in</v>

3035
02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:40.660
<v Speaker 4>for 18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet that 19th century,</v>

3036
02:18:41.110 --> 02:18:44.650
<v Speaker 4>or maybe it was the 18th and the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 4>century before it was mass produced with</v>

3037
02:18:44.651 --> 02:18:45.484
<v Speaker 4>the industrial age when you could make a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of them for cheap enough to buy </v>

3038
02:18:48.610 --> 02:18:49.443
<v Speaker 4>would imagine.</v>

3039
02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:51.990
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it crazy to that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We still use the cordy.</v>

3040
02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:55.810
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way the keyboards are assembled,</v>

3041
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:58.450
<v Speaker 4>it works is to use the court.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He configuration it does work,</v>

3042
02:18:58.451 --> 02:19:00.790
<v Speaker 4>but it's not the fastest way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And some people are dorks.</v>

3043
02:19:00.791 --> 02:19:01.624
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people are dorks and they learned </v>

3044
02:19:02.711 --> 02:19:04.300
<v Speaker 4>the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the other way?</v>

3045
02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:05.493
<v Speaker 4>Dove racks or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you find the most efficient typing </v>

3046
02:19:09.430 --> 02:19:10.263
<v Speaker 4>configuration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a second type of configuration </v>

3047
02:19:12.670 --> 02:19:15.040
<v Speaker 4>that's more efficient and not a friend </v>
<v Speaker 4>of mine tried it,</v>

3048
02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:16.233
<v Speaker 4>he tried to learn it and he said it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it took them too long and he would </v>

3049
02:19:19.361 --> 02:19:20.194
<v Speaker 4>have to like reprogram computers when he</v>
<v Speaker 4>got them and enough to buy this certain </v>

3050
02:19:23.441 --> 02:19:25.720
<v Speaker 4>keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you had a laptop you were fucked.</v>

3051
02:19:26.530 --> 02:19:27.780
<v Speaker 4>This is the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3052
02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:28.180
<v Speaker 4>D</v>

3053
02:19:28.180 --> 02:19:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Devora,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black man or coal Mac.</v>

3054
02:19:31.590 --> 02:19:33.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's two different ones.</v>

3055
02:19:33.531 --> 02:19:34.364
<v Speaker 1>Qwerty is what we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a scroll up again so I could read </v>

3056
02:19:37.971 --> 02:19:38.804
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So alternative keyboard layouts </v>

3057
02:19:40.101 --> 02:19:43.330
<v Speaker 1>explained should you switch to devor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ach or coal muck.</v>

3058
02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:44.990
<v Speaker 1>So Cole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>c o,</v>

3059
02:19:44.991 --> 02:19:49.991
<v Speaker 1>l e m a k or D v O r a k.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's two different configurations,</v>

3060
02:19:50.211 --> 02:19:51.044
<v Speaker 1>like we see that configuration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it doesn't have quarterly at the </v>

3061
02:19:52.851 --> 02:19:53.684
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The very top is like those Arrow keys </v>

3062
02:19:55.641 --> 02:19:58.490
<v Speaker 1>and the dot and the comma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it starts with a p.</v>

3063
02:19:58.491 --> 02:20:00.380
<v Speaker 1>that's the first letter on the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3064
02:20:00.640 --> 02:20:02.810
<v Speaker 1>the first column.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other letter,</v>

3065
02:20:02.811 --> 02:20:03.644
<v Speaker 1>it's a as in the same place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as isn't in the same place right </v>

3066
02:20:05.931 --> 02:20:08.920
<v Speaker 1>next to a is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh and S is way the fuck over there with</v>

3067
02:20:08.921 --> 02:20:11.330
<v Speaker 1>your other pinkie is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really confusing.</v>

3068
02:20:12.620 --> 02:20:14.870
<v Speaker 1>But apparently if you really learn how </v>
<v Speaker 1>to type,</v>

3069
02:20:15.290 --> 02:20:17.490
<v Speaker 1>that's the best configuration because </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

3070
02:20:17.491 --> 02:20:19.520
<v Speaker 1>your hands can flow more smoothly.</v>

3071
02:20:19.810 --> 02:20:22.250
<v Speaker 1>And I think the scroll back up there </v>
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>

3072
02:20:22.251 --> 02:20:25.610
<v Speaker 1>So we can see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that configuration was,</v>

3073
02:20:26.030 --> 02:20:26.863
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they invented that because the old </v>

3074
02:20:28.881 --> 02:20:32.660
<v Speaker 1>typewriters used to bind if you smash </v>
<v Speaker 1>keys next to each other too quickly.</v>

3075
02:20:32.990 --> 02:20:35.360
<v Speaker 1>So they decided to spread it out a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit.</v>

3076
02:20:35.420 --> 02:20:37.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm old enough to remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pathetic.</v>

3077
02:20:37.370 --> 02:20:38.060
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

3078
02:20:38.060 --> 02:20:39.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that.</v>

3079
02:20:39.260 --> 02:20:42.140
<v Speaker 1>That happened in my with my mother's </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was trying to type.</v>

3080
02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I'll be at Calgary this weekend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just weekend.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it in other countries.</v>

3119
02:22:21.141 --> 02:22:21.974
<v Speaker 1>That's a real good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will ask that myself and I'll find </v>

3121
02:22:24.850 --> 02:22:25.683
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since you told me about dairy and not </v>

3122
02:22:27.571 --> 02:22:29.050
<v Speaker 1>putting it in your coughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3123
02:22:29.520 --> 02:22:33.800

<v Speaker 1>Issues.</v>

3124
02:22:33.890 --> 02:22:36.000
<v Speaker 1>What kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well apparently,</v>

3125
02:22:36.001 --> 02:22:36.834
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Brendan told me that I was always </v>

3126
02:22:38.971 --> 02:22:40.040
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3127
02:22:40.120 --> 02:22:40.751
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

3128
02:22:40.751 --> 02:22:43.350
<v Speaker 1>And my wife said the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing that with butter coffee.</v>

3129
02:22:43.650 --> 02:22:45.330
<v Speaker 1>I switched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you hear it and you say,</v>

3130
02:22:45.331 --> 02:22:46.164
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't hear you clear your throat as </v>

3131
02:22:46.921 --> 02:22:47.754
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always going to have to clear </v>

3132
02:22:47.971 --> 02:22:48.630
<v Speaker 1>your throat when you talk.</v>

3133
02:22:48.630 --> 02:22:51.690
<v Speaker 1>As much as I do a lot of bullshit coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of my mouth.</v>

3134
02:22:51.930 --> 02:22:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I got gotta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I drink black coffee now.</v>

3135
02:22:55.920 --> 02:22:56.753
<v Speaker 1>During the podcast I'll still drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee with a grass fed butter and mct </v>

3136
02:23:00.031 --> 02:23:01.750
<v Speaker 1>oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't drink it before podcast.</v>

3137
02:23:01.990 --> 02:23:03.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't drink it during a podcast I </v>
<v Speaker 1>should say.</v>

3138
02:23:04.110 --> 02:23:04.943
<v Speaker 1>Some people get bummed out like Steven l</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lives with that shit when he comes </v>

3139
02:23:07.081 --> 02:23:08.280
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna come in and a couple of weeks</v>

3140
02:23:08.281 --> 02:23:10.560
<v Speaker 1>we have to give it to him because he'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be sad.</v>

3141
02:23:10.830 --> 02:23:11.663
<v Speaker 1>He'll be sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's nothing like really good </v>

3142
02:23:12.541 --> 02:23:13.374
<v Speaker 1>coffee with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't do any kind of a cow dairy </v>

3143
02:23:16.681 --> 02:23:18.220
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked.</v>

3144
02:23:18.570 --> 02:23:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I know you said that you let you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>goat milk,</v>

3145
02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:23.550
<v Speaker 1>goat milk to raw milk and I like butter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Butter.</v>

3146
02:23:23.551 --> 02:23:24.630
<v Speaker 1>I can kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love butter.</v>

3147
02:23:24.670 --> 02:23:26.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you when my daughter was </v>
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>

3148
02:23:26.670 --> 02:23:27.530
<v Speaker 1>she could not.</v>

3149
02:23:27.550 --> 02:23:28.920
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she drank milk at all,</v>

3150
02:23:28.921 --> 02:23:30.720
<v Speaker 1>she would throw up when she was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>

3151
02:23:30.750 --> 02:23:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I could not drink milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We try,</v>

3152
02:23:32.110 --> 02:23:32.943
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to gauge when you have a </v>

3153
02:23:34.321 --> 02:23:35.400
<v Speaker 1>little kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what they like,</v>

3154
02:23:35.401 --> 02:23:39.150
<v Speaker 1>what they don't like and what a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But goat milk went down like that.</v>

3155
02:23:39.180 --> 02:23:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really interesting.</v>

3156
02:23:41.150 --> 02:23:41.983
<v Speaker 1>She was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're talking like she was a </v>

3157
02:23:42.391 --> 02:23:43.224
<v Speaker 1>really young baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She loved goat milk and for whatever </v>

3158
02:23:46.201 --> 02:23:49.050
<v Speaker 1>reason we stopped buying it and now we </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy just regular cow's milk.</v>

3159
02:23:49.110 --> 02:23:53.760
<v Speaker 1>They didn't really enchanting experiment</v>
<v Speaker 1>with with goats and kind of proving that</v>

3160
02:23:53.761 --> 02:23:57.960
<v Speaker 1>when you eat a food that's super </v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious,</v>

3161
02:23:57.961 --> 02:24:00.150
<v Speaker 1>like say you eat a peach and you love </v>
<v Speaker 1>peaches,</v>

3162
02:24:00.330 --> 02:24:02.220
<v Speaker 1>then you meet another peach and you love</v>
<v Speaker 1>peaches,</v>

3163
02:24:02.221 --> 02:24:03.054
<v Speaker 1>but there's somewhere along the line </v>
<v Speaker 1>where with foods that are also giving </v>

3164
02:24:05.481 --> 02:24:07.500
<v Speaker 1>you nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stopped as a trigger.</v>

3165
02:24:07.950 --> 02:24:12.090
<v Speaker 1>So whereas when you flavor food that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any nutritional value,</v>

3166
02:24:12.091 --> 02:24:13.500
<v Speaker 1>you'll just keep eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to read us.</v>

3167
02:24:13.501 --> 02:24:14.334
<v Speaker 1>You keep eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep eating and keeping and it tricks </v>

3168
02:24:16.141 --> 02:24:17.970
<v Speaker 1>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something about this guy did</v>

3169
02:24:17.980 --> 02:24:18.813
<v Speaker 1>this experiment where this professor at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the university took these goats and he </v>

3170
02:24:22.441 --> 02:24:24.870
<v Speaker 1>starved them a phosphorous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't get many phosphorous in their</v>

3171
02:24:24.871 --> 02:24:25.704
<v Speaker 1>diet and they started doing weird things</v>
<v Speaker 1>like drinking their own urine and </v>

3172
02:24:27.541 --> 02:24:28.374
<v Speaker 1>drinking each other's urine and pawn at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dirt and weird shit because they </v>

3173
02:24:30.121 --> 02:24:35.121
<v Speaker 1>need phosphorous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then he would feed them two different</v>

3174
02:24:35.590 --> 02:24:37.230
<v Speaker 1>samples of food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the coconut,</v>

3175
02:24:37.680 --> 02:24:40.080
<v Speaker 1>the coconut flavored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was maple flavored food.</v>

3176
02:24:40.330 --> 02:24:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the coconut flavored food,</v>

3177
02:24:42.361 --> 02:24:44.430
<v Speaker 1>when he'd feed them the coconut flavored</v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

3178
02:24:44.890 --> 02:24:45.723
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he would put a tube down their </v>

3179
02:24:46.911 --> 02:24:49.320
<v Speaker 1>throat and fill their stomachs with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phosphorous.</v>

3180
02:24:49.980 --> 02:24:50.813
<v Speaker 1>And all of a sudden the goats were </v>
<v Speaker 1>instinctively going for the coconut </v>

3181
02:24:54.841 --> 02:24:55.631
<v Speaker 1>flavored food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3182
02:24:55.631 --> 02:24:56.780
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing you'd say is,</v>

3183
02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:57.271
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

3184
02:24:57.271 --> 02:24:58.770
<v Speaker 1>maybe they just like coconut flavored </v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

3185
02:24:58.980 --> 02:25:01.920
<v Speaker 1>But then he took the maple flavored food</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the coconut flavor food,</v>

3186
02:25:01.980 --> 02:25:04.800
<v Speaker 1>another control group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when those goats would eat the maple</v>

3187
02:25:04.801 --> 02:25:05.634
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd stick the tube down their throat </v>

3188
02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:11.970
<v Speaker 1>and fill their stomachs with phosphorus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the goats didn't know that they were</v>

3189
02:25:11.971 --> 02:25:12.804
<v Speaker 1>getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that control group would always </v>

3190
02:25:15.091 --> 02:25:17.250
<v Speaker 1>go for the maple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3191
02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:18.113
<v Speaker 1>Because they could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they didn't know they are </v>

3192
02:25:19.441 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 1>getting phosphorous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just somehow equated the</v>

3193
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:26.910
<v Speaker 3>fact that they were going to get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>phosphorus from that.</v>

3194
02:25:27.130 --> 02:25:30.400
<v Speaker 3>So they think that human beings have </v>
<v Speaker 3>this strange mechanism in their,</v>

3195
02:25:30.490 --> 02:25:33.580
<v Speaker 3>in their sort of brain and body where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3196
02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:38.350
<v Speaker 3>once you are eating a food that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutritional value,</v>

3197
02:25:38.351 --> 02:25:39.184
<v Speaker 3>so if it's sweet like dates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got nutritional value as well or </v>

3198
02:25:42.191 --> 02:25:43.024
<v Speaker 3>whatever it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somewhere online we get satiated no </v>

3199
02:25:45.071 --> 02:25:47.650
<v Speaker 3>matter how delicious we find it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's a natural foods.</v>

3200
02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:49.720
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because nobody eats like a giant bowl of</v>

3201
02:25:49.721 --> 02:25:50.650
<v Speaker 3>peaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3202
02:25:51.490 --> 02:25:54.370
<v Speaker 3>You might eat two of your crazy right </v>
<v Speaker 3>and this,</v>

3203
02:25:54.371 --> 02:25:56.260
<v Speaker 3>but you'll eat a fucking pie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>

3204
02:25:56.261 --> 02:25:58.560
<v Speaker 3>You lead a buyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll lead with ice cream.</v>

3205
02:25:58.561 --> 02:25:59.394
<v Speaker 3>You might eat that whole pie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially when it's artificially </v>

3206
02:26:00.611 --> 02:26:03.490
<v Speaker 3>flavored.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that triggers this weird.</v>

3207
02:26:03.610 --> 02:26:04.443
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things in this book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dorito effect is that this guy talks </v>

3208
02:26:06.551 --> 02:26:10.210
<v Speaker 3>about the fact that that has kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thrown our,</v>

3209
02:26:10.270 --> 02:26:11.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's one of the things,</v>

3210
02:26:11.741 --> 02:26:14.050
<v Speaker 3>one of the culprits of obesity perhaps.</v>

3211
02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:15.153
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3212
02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:16.570
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Flavoring,</v>

3213
02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:17.433
<v Speaker 3>flavoring for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent that totally makes </v>

3214
02:26:18.911 --> 02:26:20.200
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the sugar thing.</v>

3215
02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:21.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chickens take chickens because we grow </v>

3216
02:26:23.561 --> 02:26:24.281
<v Speaker 3>them so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3217
02:26:24.281 --> 02:26:27.880
<v Speaker 3>so usually like after World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fastest chicken they could grow,</v>

3218
02:26:27.881 --> 02:26:30.580
<v Speaker 3>they had a contest was to get it to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>point where you could eat.</v>

3219
02:26:30.581 --> 02:26:35.180
<v Speaker 3>It was 14 weeks and now we've got it </v>
<v Speaker 3>down to six weeks and yeah.</v>

3220
02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:37.210
<v Speaker 3>So now you what you're eating his big </v>
<v Speaker 3>fat babies.</v>

3221
02:26:37.211 --> 02:26:38.830
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that the oils aren't the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>

3222
02:26:38.831 --> 02:26:40.870
<v Speaker 3>They're not as nutritious as an heirloom</v>
<v Speaker 3>chicken and chicken.</v>

3223
02:26:40.871 --> 02:26:43.660
<v Speaker 3>It's grown to eight when it far just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the chickens you have,</v>

3224
02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:47.100
<v Speaker 3>they like worms and whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat my chicken,</v>

3225
02:26:47.101 --> 02:26:47.561
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3226
02:26:47.561 --> 02:26:51.050
<v Speaker 3>But if you ate that chicken to be the </v>
<v Speaker 3>oils and the meat would be different and</v>

3227
02:26:51.051 --> 02:26:53.050
<v Speaker 3>it'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it'd be also more flavorful.</v>

3228
02:26:53.450 --> 02:26:56.110
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because chicken has no taste,</v>

3229
02:26:56.111 --> 02:26:58.060
<v Speaker 3>we had to figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things you had to do to</v>

3230
02:26:58.061 --> 02:26:59.800
<v Speaker 3>a chicken to make it take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to Brian it,</v>

3231
02:26:59.970 --> 02:27:01.720
<v Speaker 3>you've got to flavor it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to do all kinds of shit.</v>

3232
02:27:01.721 --> 02:27:02.554
<v Speaker 3>And it was way better than children.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That wild Turkey that we shot with </v>

3233
02:27:04.661 --> 02:27:05.650
<v Speaker 3>vanilla.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>

3234
02:27:05.680 --> 02:27:07.620
<v Speaker 3>that was delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3235
02:27:07.621 --> 02:27:12.370
<v Speaker 3>I cook that whole thing on the grill.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I marinated it in my standard marinade,</v>

3236
02:27:12.580 --> 02:27:15.140
<v Speaker 3>which is newman zone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>balsamic vinegarette taste.</v>

3237
02:27:15.250 --> 02:27:17.620
<v Speaker 3>Just marinate and everything in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>

3238
02:27:17.950 --> 02:27:19.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The red beat,</v>

3239
02:27:19.511 --> 02:27:23.570
<v Speaker 3>the darker meat was different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the breast plates of like the way a</v>

3240
02:27:23.650 --> 02:27:25.540
<v Speaker 3>Rinella did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He breaded it and fried it.</v>

3241
02:27:25.541 --> 02:27:26.374
<v Speaker 3>And I used to do this good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to joke about when we did our </v>

3242
02:27:29.081 --> 02:27:29.914
<v Speaker 3>live podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brent and I about how I called it </v>

3243
02:27:31.781 --> 02:27:34.000
<v Speaker 3>Rogan's gift when you bought me that bow</v>
<v Speaker 3>and arrow.</v>

3244
02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:36.620
<v Speaker 3>And first I talked about when we hunted </v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkey and I was like,</v>

3245
02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:40.300
<v Speaker 3>kill a Turkey with dressed in the field </v>
<v Speaker 3>map and we cut it and it was.</v>

3246
02:27:40.301 --> 02:27:42.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean I didn't shoot it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've secured Joe's hips when he shot</v>

3247
02:27:42.761 --> 02:27:44.350
<v Speaker 3>the Turkey and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got it.</v>

3248
02:27:44.380 --> 02:27:47.710
<v Speaker 3>We brought it up and it tastes just like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turkey,</v>

3249
02:27:47.730 --> 02:27:48.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they don't lock.</v>

3250
02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:50.710
<v Speaker 3>And then I go to this whole fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3251
02:27:50.860 --> 02:27:53.140
<v Speaker 3>Remember when he gave me the bow and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Arrow and I was like,</v>

3252
02:27:53.470 --> 02:27:54.310
<v Speaker 3>I looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3253
02:27:54.690 --> 02:27:56.860
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what to say because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know anything about boys,</v>

3254
02:27:56.861 --> 02:27:58.810
<v Speaker 3>but I think I saw the whole thing and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>went,</v>

3255
02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:02.770
<v Speaker 3>got me a fucking hoyt and you were like </v>
<v Speaker 3>carbon fiber.</v>

3256
02:28:02.771 --> 02:28:04.700
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole thing,</v>

3257
02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:08.650
<v Speaker 3>hundred percent carbon fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you like trying to show somebody who</v>

3258
02:28:08.651 --> 02:28:10.480
<v Speaker 3>really appreciate the gift,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't know what to say about it.</v>

3259
02:28:10.770 --> 02:28:13.090
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can shoot one shot,</v>

3260
02:28:13.150 --> 02:28:14.890
<v Speaker 3>one Arrow because you want to have me </v>
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>

3261
02:28:14.980 --> 02:28:15.730
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd never.</v>

3262
02:28:15.730 --> 02:28:18.130
<v Speaker 3>You'd never organized it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to be the one who does all</v>

3263
02:28:18.131 --> 02:28:20.210
<v Speaker 3>the work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were so trusting.</v>

3264
02:28:20.530 --> 02:28:22.160
<v Speaker 3>The greatest is crazy.</v>

3265
02:28:22.250 --> 02:28:26.090
<v Speaker 4>The fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The grant and Swiss you with that expert</v>

3266
02:28:26.300 --> 02:28:29.810
<v Speaker 4>Guy Archer and the greatest tax was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you going to have me come over and I</v>

3267
02:28:29.811 --> 02:28:32.030
<v Speaker 4>was going to shoot with you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got so into it.</v>

3268
02:28:32.031 --> 02:28:33.640
<v Speaker 4>I got a text from you and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey brother,</v>

3269
02:28:33.770 --> 02:28:34.603
<v Speaker 4>this is not going to work today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a lot of really important work to </v>

3270
02:28:35.950 --> 02:28:38.440
<v Speaker 4>do with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're so obsessed with it.</v>

3271
02:28:38.441 --> 02:28:43.441
<v Speaker 4>He told me we need it needs to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to be looking at one person,</v>

3272
02:28:43.910 --> 02:28:46.610
<v Speaker 4>like if you're working with one person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're working on their archery form.</v>

3273
02:28:46.660 --> 02:28:47.493
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're working on two people at the </v>

3274
02:28:48.381 --> 02:28:49.214
<v Speaker 4>same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not even going to get half the </v>

3275
02:28:49.881 --> 02:28:50.714
<v Speaker 4>work done with either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense and he wants to do </v>

3276
02:28:52.101 --> 02:28:52.934
<v Speaker 4>something with you and Brendan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wants to do something where he hooks </v>

3277
02:28:55.731 --> 02:28:57.160
<v Speaker 4>you guys up with hoyt.</v>

3278
02:28:57.270 --> 02:29:00.190
<v Speaker 4>Both teaches you and you guys could all </v>
<v Speaker 4>make a video.</v>

3279
02:29:00.191 --> 02:29:02.810
<v Speaker 4>It can make a video of you guys shooting</v>
<v Speaker 4>bows for the first time when.</v>

3280
02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:04.130
<v Speaker 4>But he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has to like,</v>

3281
02:29:04.210 --> 02:29:05.043
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do that and work with you </v>

3282
02:29:05.811 --> 02:29:09.470
<v Speaker 4>because work with me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm many years advanced.</v>

3283
02:29:09.530 --> 02:29:10.363
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not saying that I'm really good because </v>

3284
02:29:10.971 --> 02:29:13.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm so far advanced from you guys.</v>

3285
02:29:13.251 --> 02:29:14.084
<v Speaker 4>Like he would have to work with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So specifically on every little thing </v>

3286
02:29:16.791 --> 02:29:17.624
<v Speaker 4>and there's so many different things you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to think of when it takes a long </v>

3287
02:29:19.671 --> 02:29:22.550
<v Speaker 4>fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like give me an example of bone arrow.</v>

3288
02:29:22.580 --> 02:29:26.060
<v Speaker 4>So give me an example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I would imagine how you stand,</v>

3289
02:29:26.061 --> 02:29:27.680
<v Speaker 4>how you breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how you pull back.</v>

3290
02:29:27.740 --> 02:29:30.630
<v Speaker 4>There's a ton of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's how you hold the bow.</v>

3291
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:34.640
<v Speaker 4>What technique used to draw back what </v>
<v Speaker 4>muscles you're pulling with.</v>

3292
02:29:34.641 --> 02:29:35.474
<v Speaker 4>You have to be super conscious of </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulling with the muscles and your </v>

3293
02:29:37.161 --> 02:29:37.820
<v Speaker 4>scapula.</v>

3294
02:29:37.820 --> 02:29:38.420
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

3295
02:29:38.420 --> 02:29:40.880
<v Speaker 4>where's your elbow position?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How will you torquing the bow?</v>

3296
02:29:40.890 --> 02:29:42.440
<v Speaker 4>How are you gripping the bose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bow,</v>

3297
02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:45.320
<v Speaker 4>crossing the lifeline on your hand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it is,</v>

3298
02:29:45.321 --> 02:29:46.880
<v Speaker 4>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You've got to readdress it.</v>

3299
02:29:47.060 --> 02:29:49.250
<v Speaker 4>How you gripping it with your fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a death grip?</v>

3300
02:29:49.251 --> 02:29:50.084
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a loose grip?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that affecting the actual trajectory </v>

3301
02:29:52.471 --> 02:29:54.380
<v Speaker 4>of the Arrow is at torquing when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>release it,</v>

3302
02:29:54.381 --> 02:29:56.850
<v Speaker 4>when you release it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you punch the triggers?</v>

3303
02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:59.790
<v Speaker 4>The Arrow flying randomly left and </v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3304
02:29:59.791 --> 02:30:02.920
<v Speaker 4>and all sorts of different directions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many forever.</v>

3305
02:30:02.990 --> 02:30:04.700
<v Speaker 4>It takes forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes forever.</v>

3306
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:07.880
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not even like one 100 of the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

3307
02:30:08.030 --> 02:30:10.640
<v Speaker 4>but I'm three years ahead of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think,</v>

3308
02:30:10.910 --> 02:30:12.080
<v Speaker 4>do you think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3309
02:30:13.020 --> 02:30:13.853
<v Speaker 4>here fucked?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that when you get really </v>

3310
02:30:17.631 --> 02:30:20.210
<v Speaker 4>good at something like just take our </v>
<v Speaker 4>trays and example,</v>

3311
02:30:20.211 --> 02:30:22.730
<v Speaker 4>I know there's a book called the archery</v>
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>

3312
02:30:23.090 --> 02:30:27.470
<v Speaker 4>but do you think that when you master </v>
<v Speaker 4>something like archery,</v>

3313
02:30:28.940 --> 02:30:32.960
<v Speaker 4>like do you think that's almost enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>to learn about life or do you think that</v>

3314
02:30:32.961 --> 02:30:34.370
<v Speaker 4>that's a little bit romantic?</v>

3315
02:30:34.580 --> 02:30:35.413
<v Speaker 4>I think there are elements from anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you get really good at that apply </v>

3316
02:30:38.541 --> 02:30:40.880
<v Speaker 4>to life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that learning something,</v>

3317
02:30:40.881 --> 02:30:41.714
<v Speaker 4>getting really good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you learn about life has been disproved </v>

3318
02:30:44.120 --> 02:30:44.953
<v Speaker 4>over and over again by extreme winters </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are gigantic fuck ups in their </v>

3319
02:30:47.571 --> 02:30:48.404
<v Speaker 4>regular life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when you get obsessed with </v>

3320
02:30:50.331 --> 02:30:53.270
<v Speaker 4>something to the point of excellence to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the point where you're the best at it or</v>

3321
02:30:53.271 --> 02:30:56.930
<v Speaker 4>one of the best added or you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>running to be one of the best at in your</v>

3322
02:30:56.931 --> 02:30:57.764
<v Speaker 4>fucking brain does not have much room </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a lot of the normal shit that </v>

3323
02:31:00.831 --> 02:31:02.720
<v Speaker 4>everybody else has stuffed in their </v>
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>

3324
02:31:02.960 --> 02:31:03.793
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to be online on forums,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gossiping about celebrity bullshit or </v>

3325
02:31:08.090 --> 02:31:08.923
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking shit about the latest movie or </v>

3326
02:31:10.491 --> 02:31:11.324
<v Speaker 4>talking shit about the latest song.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You will be obsessed with one task and </v>

3327
02:31:16.251 --> 02:31:18.440
<v Speaker 4>that does not necessarily make you a </v>
<v Speaker 4>balance person.</v>

3328
02:31:18.530 --> 02:31:19.363
<v Speaker 4>You might not have time for your family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might have time to talk to your </v>

3329
02:31:21.571 --> 02:31:24.240
<v Speaker 4>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You might not have time to have friends.</v>

3330
02:31:24.390 --> 02:31:27.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean you might be in recovery </v>
<v Speaker 4>training.</v>

3331
02:31:27.181 --> 02:31:28.014
<v Speaker 4>You might be doing a million different </v>
<v Speaker 4>things to try to accentuate your </v>

3332
02:31:30.421 --> 02:31:35.421
<v Speaker 4>abilities in basketball and primarily a </v>
<v Speaker 4>male characteristic.</v>

3333
02:31:35.850 --> 02:31:36.683
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a feature of the male brain and </v>

3334
02:31:37.790 --> 02:31:40.530
<v Speaker 4>the ability to exclude everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but one thing,</v>

3335
02:31:40.650 --> 02:31:43.350
<v Speaker 4>it's very rare in women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you see it and it's an aberration.</v>

3336
02:31:43.351 --> 02:31:45.420
<v Speaker 4>You see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of women athletes you see in a lot</v>

3337
02:31:45.421 --> 02:31:48.180
<v Speaker 4>of women's superstar athletes for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also much rarer.</v>

3338
02:31:48.181 --> 02:31:49.070
<v Speaker 4>Apparently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean worse.</v>

3339
02:31:49.120 --> 02:31:51.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's why when someone like Rhonda</v>

3340
02:31:51.480 --> 02:31:52.770
<v Speaker 4>Rousey comes along,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>

3341
02:31:52.771 --> 02:31:53.604
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at that.</v>

3342
02:31:53.610 --> 02:31:54.690
<v Speaker 4>There's one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3343
02:31:54.691 --> 02:31:58.560
<v Speaker 4>there's a female version of the super </v>
<v Speaker 4>winter exists,</v>

3344
02:31:58.950 --> 02:32:00.840
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they seek out male versions of those</v>

3345
02:32:00.841 --> 02:32:04.410
<v Speaker 4>super winters and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have super winter babies that's a,</v>

3346
02:32:04.560 --> 02:32:05.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>standard stuff,</v>

3347
02:32:06.180 --> 02:32:07.710
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's to me,</v>

3348
02:32:07.890 --> 02:32:10.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's indicative of </v>
<v Speaker 4>learning about life.</v>

3349
02:32:10.110 --> 02:32:13.800
<v Speaker 4>It's learning how to get really awesome </v>
<v Speaker 4>at one thing and that might translate if</v>

3350
02:32:13.801 --> 02:32:16.980
<v Speaker 4>you can step away from the madness and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the momentum of whatever the fuck it is.</v>

3351
02:32:16.981 --> 02:32:17.814
<v Speaker 4>You're obsessed with that ability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>really completely focusing on one thing </v>

3352
02:32:20.821 --> 02:32:24.660
<v Speaker 4>might aid you if you can completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>focus in on life,</v>

3353
02:32:25.050 --> 02:32:29.520
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that an athlete or an </v>
<v Speaker 4>archer or anybody else is doing anything</v>

3354
02:32:29.521 --> 02:32:31.680
<v Speaker 4>obsessive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lee is actually focusing on life.</v>

3355
02:32:33.270 --> 02:32:35.120
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that might not be the case.</v>

3356
02:32:35.420 --> 02:32:36.690
<v Speaker 4>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never thought of that.</v>

3357
02:32:36.720 --> 02:32:37.553
<v Speaker 4>That's a good way to articulate because </v>
<v Speaker 4>even like you see like great artists </v>

3358
02:32:40.410 --> 02:32:41.680
<v Speaker 4>like Paul Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pollock,</v>

3359
02:32:41.681 --> 02:32:42.220
<v Speaker 4>whoever they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3360
02:32:42.220 --> 02:32:43.890
<v Speaker 4>they weren't that happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they,</v>

3361
02:32:43.891 --> 02:32:44.581
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3362
02:32:44.581 --> 02:32:45.920
<v Speaker 4>a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of examples of like,</v>

3363
02:32:46.470 --> 02:32:47.303
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great authors are great artists or </v>

3364
02:32:48.511 --> 02:32:49.281
<v Speaker 4>whoever they are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>

3365
02:32:49.281 --> 02:32:50.114
<v Speaker 4>they were so obsessed with their </v>
<v Speaker 4>expression that they also live </v>

3366
02:32:52.841 --> 02:32:53.640
<v Speaker 4>depressive lives now.</v>

3367
02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:54.473
<v Speaker 4>Whether or not whether or not though </v>
<v Speaker 4>depressives tend to obsess might be </v>

3368
02:33:00.691 --> 02:33:03.450
<v Speaker 4>another question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's probably both.</v>

3369
02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:05.720
<v Speaker 4>Both things are probably true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3370
02:33:05.760 --> 02:33:06.593
<v Speaker 4>I was a giant prince fan still am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like one of my all time favorite </v>

3371
02:33:10.111 --> 02:33:12.260
<v Speaker 4>musical artists.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

3372
02:33:12.300 --> 02:33:13.133
<v Speaker 4>when I found out that prince had all </v>
<v Speaker 4>these issues with his health and he's </v>

3373
02:33:16.411 --> 02:33:18.930
<v Speaker 4>taking pain pills and he was addicted to</v>
<v Speaker 4>pain pills,</v>

3374
02:33:19.230 --> 02:33:20.940
<v Speaker 4>it was almost like in denial about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3375
02:33:20.941 --> 02:33:22.380
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy's too smart for that.</v>

3376
02:33:22.410 --> 02:33:24.990
<v Speaker 4>Like that guy is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's smarter than the system.</v>

3377
02:33:24.991 --> 02:33:25.824
<v Speaker 4>We figured out how to make a symbol to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get out of a contract because he had to </v>

3378
02:33:27.871 --> 02:33:28.704
<v Speaker 4>use his name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he was the artist formerly known as </v>

3379
02:33:30.481 --> 02:33:31.980
<v Speaker 4>Prince and became a mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was what.</v>

3380
02:33:31.981 --> 02:33:33.210
<v Speaker 4>That was all bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They will look,</v>

3381
02:33:33.211 --> 02:33:34.110
<v Speaker 4>you can't use the name Prince.</v>

3382
02:33:34.110 --> 02:33:34.531
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3383
02:33:34.531 --> 02:33:37.050
<v Speaker 4>for real motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know how famous I am?</v>

3384
02:33:37.290 --> 02:33:38.580
<v Speaker 4>I'll make a symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be,</v>

3385
02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:39.473
<v Speaker 4>I'll just be assembled locks this and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then when you hear prints like </v>

3386
02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:44.100
<v Speaker 4>interviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you rarely do,</v>

3387
02:33:44.190 --> 02:33:45.690
<v Speaker 4>you see as art,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is amazing.</v>

3388
02:33:45.691 --> 02:33:47.000
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still to this day,</v>

3389
02:33:47.001 --> 02:33:48.670
<v Speaker 4>I think the purple rain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3390
02:33:48.690 --> 02:33:50.610
<v Speaker 4>like it's one of the greatest songs when</v>
<v Speaker 4>the greatest.</v>

3391
02:33:50.611 --> 02:33:53.550
<v Speaker 4>It was a great movie musical album.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3392
02:33:53.551 --> 02:33:54.384
<v Speaker 4>let's go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he had some fucking jams and in </v>

3393
02:33:57.211 --> 02:34:01.470
<v Speaker 4>that time he was revolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just weird little androgynous guy.</v>

3394
02:34:01.680 --> 02:34:03.390
<v Speaker 4>And then just like the whole thing was </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

3395
02:34:03.391 --> 02:34:07.090
<v Speaker 4>The dancing is like hair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

3396
02:34:07.300 --> 02:34:08.680
<v Speaker 4>I should have known.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

3397
02:34:08.681 --> 02:34:12.720
<v Speaker 4>The way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ways that it wouldn't last.</v>

3398
02:34:14.490 --> 02:34:17.500
<v Speaker 4>And he had that hair all done up at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>high stiletto heels.</v>

3399
02:34:17.501 --> 02:34:18.010
<v Speaker 4>It was amazing.</v>

3400
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:19.270
<v Speaker 1>My friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Tommy,</v>

3401
02:34:19.271 --> 02:34:23.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget my friend Tommy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so fucking gay.</v>

3402
02:34:24.690 --> 02:34:28.540
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes in there and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's fucking awesome.</v>

3403
02:34:29.420 --> 02:34:31.440
<v Speaker 1>While he wasn't gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't good.</v>

3404
02:34:31.441 --> 02:34:34.210
<v Speaker 1>He was heterosexual and he wasn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>really like gay people.</v>

3405
02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:37.150
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the weirdest jobs is </v>
<v Speaker 1>witnessed and it was.</v>

3406
02:34:37.180 --> 02:34:40.570
<v Speaker 1>He kind of said some homophobic shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people get really mad at him about,</v>

3407
02:34:40.930 --> 02:34:43.330
<v Speaker 1>about one of the reasons he was trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to equate,</v>

3408
02:34:43.331 --> 02:34:44.164
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

3409
02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:45.273
<v Speaker 1>He was trying to equate all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things that were going on in </v>

3410
02:34:48.161 --> 02:34:52.060
<v Speaker 1>the world with people not following </v>
<v Speaker 1>God's way and sticking their dick in any</v>

3411
02:34:52.061 --> 02:34:53.740
<v Speaker 1>place they want and people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3412
02:34:53.741 --> 02:34:54.131
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

3413
02:34:54.131 --> 02:34:55.200
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you just say that?</v>

3414
02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Did you just say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3415
02:34:56.950 --> 02:34:58.180
<v Speaker 1>let's go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the guy.</v>

3416
02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:01.030
<v Speaker 1>The fucking addresses in purple and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talks about being a pervert,</v>

3417
02:35:01.220 --> 02:35:02.053
<v Speaker 1>but he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very conservative and a lot of ways </v>

3418
02:35:03.051 --> 02:35:03.340
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>

3419
02:35:03.340 --> 02:35:07.180
<v Speaker 1>But what were you saying about to say is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he also was into chem trails.</v>

3420
02:35:07.450 --> 02:35:08.283
<v Speaker 1>He also believed that the government was</v>
<v Speaker 1>spraying the sky and that's what was </v>

3421
02:35:09.941 --> 02:35:13.300
<v Speaker 1>making everybody angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you listened to him talk and you</v>

3422
02:35:13.301 --> 02:35:15.140
<v Speaker 1>hear him like discuss things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll realize,</v>

3423
02:35:15.220 --> 02:35:18.390
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3424
02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:19.810
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he said about Kennedy.</v>

3425
02:35:19.811 --> 02:35:20.644
<v Speaker 1>I was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

3426
02:35:21.010 --> 02:35:21.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I've noticed is that when a plane </v>

3427
02:35:23.501 --> 02:35:24.334
<v Speaker 1>would go by and you'd see these trails </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody started acting crazy and </v>

3428
02:35:27.551 --> 02:35:29.890
<v Speaker 1>they'd be fighting and I'm all I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying is take a look at it,</v>

3429
02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:31.330
<v Speaker 1>just take a look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3430
02:35:31.450 --> 02:35:32.290
<v Speaker 1>I won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't,</v>

3431
02:35:32.500 --> 02:35:35.470
<v Speaker 1>I won't take a right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you as a musical genius.</v>

3432
02:35:35.471 --> 02:35:36.304
<v Speaker 1>I won't take a look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a problem that when he </v>

3433
02:35:38.051 --> 02:35:42.580
<v Speaker 1>said that he was probably 50 and when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>got famous he was probably 20,</v>

3434
02:35:42.880 --> 02:35:43.713
<v Speaker 1>so 30 years of being completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>insulated and isolated people kissing </v>

3437
02:35:55.240 --> 02:35:58.170

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>years with many scientologists.</v>

3527
02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:36.290
<v Speaker 1>So I remember the class that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned in that book.</v>

3528
02:39:36.440 --> 02:39:37.273
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I used to go visit you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember when you and I went to </v>

3529
02:39:40.251 --> 02:39:42.790
<v Speaker 1>watch a guy sing songs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3530
02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:43.993
<v Speaker 1>and he was fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was wonderful and hassles and his </v>

3531
02:39:46.970 --> 02:39:48.710
<v Speaker 1>shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his choice.</v>

3532
02:39:48.980 --> 02:39:50.400
<v Speaker 1>He said something interesting about it.</v>

3533
02:39:50.400 --> 02:39:52.380
<v Speaker 1>He'd been scientologist for 20 years and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have a scientologist did.</v>

3535
02:39:54.700 --> 02:39:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Somebody asked me that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

3536
02:39:55.790 --> 02:39:59.030
<v Speaker 1>let me just let me put this to rest as </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a member of the church.</v>

3537
02:39:59.150 --> 02:40:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Tells you what does that mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3538
02:40:00.060 --> 02:40:04.130
<v Speaker 1>I've taken a lot of classes there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got nothing out of a lot of classes</v>

3539
02:40:04.131 --> 02:40:05.900
<v Speaker 1>and some classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten a lot.</v>

3540
02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:08.930
<v Speaker 1>If you want to call me a scientologists </v>
<v Speaker 1>then go ahead and then we just get to in</v>

3541
02:40:08.931 --> 02:40:10.790
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a fucking great teacher,</v>

3542
02:40:11.270 --> 02:40:12.360
<v Speaker 1>but his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's in a,</v>

3543
02:40:12.361 --> 02:40:16.440
<v Speaker 1>not A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes him in Jeffrey Tambor,</v>

3544
02:40:16.500 --> 02:40:20.850
<v Speaker 1>who's The star of transparent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be a scientologist for years and</v>

3545
02:40:20.851 --> 02:40:22.710
<v Speaker 1>he quit and it's called.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He blew.</v>

3546
02:40:22.830 --> 02:40:24.660
<v Speaker 1>He ran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got out.</v>

3547
02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you get in trouble when you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3548
02:40:26.941 --> 02:40:29.040
<v Speaker 1>but there's David miscavige.</v>

3549
02:40:29.210 --> 02:40:34.210
<v Speaker 1>The secretive sort of leader has never </v>
<v Speaker 1>been painted in a very favorable light.</v>

3550
02:40:34.890 --> 02:40:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you read that book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know though.</v>

3551
02:40:37.380 --> 02:40:38.213
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a naughty little group of </v>

3552
02:40:40.171 --> 02:40:41.790
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>

3553
02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:43.870
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm.</v>

3554
02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:45.700
<v Speaker 1>Allie was in that naughty little group </v>
<v Speaker 1>of human.</v>

3555
02:40:45.701 --> 02:40:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any,</v>

3556
02:40:46.380 --> 02:40:47.970
<v Speaker 1>like any group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like any group,</v>

3557
02:40:47.971 --> 02:40:51.280
<v Speaker 1>anybody who belongs to any group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have dogma.</v>

3558
02:40:51.330 --> 02:40:53.670
<v Speaker 1>You're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to need tradition and story</v>

3559
02:40:53.671 --> 02:40:54.504
<v Speaker 1>to to keep that group together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a group without having </v>

3560
02:40:57.610 --> 02:41:01.530
<v Speaker 1>stories written by a guy on a captain's </v>
<v Speaker 1>outfit on with metals he gave himself.</v>

3561
02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:02.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

3562
02:41:02.311 --> 02:41:03.144
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was probably very crazy and crazy as </v>

3563
02:41:06.541 --> 02:41:07.890
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently,</v>

3564
02:41:07.891 --> 02:41:11.790
<v Speaker 1>there's a great new documentary that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been hearing about called Holy Hell</v>

3565
02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:12.953
<v Speaker 1>about some guy who got involved in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>really nutty cult in 1985 and was in a </v>

3566
02:41:19.261 --> 02:41:20.094
<v Speaker 1>cult for like 20 years and a documented </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of crazy shit and is going to </v>

3567
02:41:23.821 --> 02:41:25.140
<v Speaker 1>put a documentary out about it.</v>

3568
02:41:25.170 --> 02:41:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3569
02:41:26.111 --> 02:41:26.944
<v Speaker 1>And the cult leader is apparently he hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>his past as a gay porn star and he was </v>

3570
02:41:31.260 --> 02:41:31.960
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is at,</v>

3571
02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:32.793
<v Speaker 1>as we have the ABS on that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people are always going to be long </v>

3572
02:41:35.551 --> 02:41:36.340
<v Speaker 1>to call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

3573
02:41:36.340 --> 02:41:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Always going to want to group up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their version of the truth.</v>

3574
02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:45.300
<v Speaker 1>A documentary villain for the ages and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented closeup look.</v>

3575
02:41:45.301 --> 02:41:49.470
<v Speaker 1>We watch with bated breath as the mask </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly,</v>

3576
02:41:50.030 --> 02:41:51.750
<v Speaker 1>slowly pulled away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled off.</v>

3577
02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I always thought baited was B,</v>

3578
02:41:54.291 --> 02:41:56.460
<v Speaker 1>a t be a t,</v>
<v Speaker 1>e d,</v>

3579
02:41:56.461 --> 02:41:59.070
<v Speaker 1>what does it even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baden Bat ed.</v>

3580
02:41:59.090 --> 02:42:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Bated breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3581
02:42:00.390 --> 02:42:01.223
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I thought that it was ba </v>

3582
02:42:02.690 --> 02:42:05.100
<v Speaker 1>because bated breath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never knew what it meant,</v>

3583
02:42:05.370 --> 02:42:08.670
<v Speaker 1>and the in great suspense very anxiously</v>
<v Speaker 1>or excitedly,</v>

3584
02:42:08.671 --> 02:42:10.890
<v Speaker 1>he waited for a reply to his offered </v>
<v Speaker 1>with bated breath.</v>

3585
02:42:11.100 --> 02:42:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I never knew what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew what it implied,</v>

3586
02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:14.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you waited and it was highly </v>

3587
02:42:16.711 --> 02:42:19.850
<v Speaker 1>anticipating it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never knew led.</v>

3588
02:42:19.860 --> 02:42:20.693
<v Speaker 1>It was spelled that way or what it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to get out of weird words that </v>

3589
02:42:23.191 --> 02:42:25.230
<v Speaker 1>you'll hear sometimes time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a long,</v>

3590
02:42:25.231 --> 02:42:25.980
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3591
02:42:25.980 --> 02:42:28.980
<v Speaker 1>I heard somebody use the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>solipsistic and I was like,</v>

3592
02:42:29.580 --> 02:42:30.600
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

3593
02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:31.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said I've got to go back to a </v>

3594
02:42:35.580 --> 02:42:37.990
<v Speaker 1>definition on that one and I never did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just means.</v>

3595
02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Has anything else ever baited?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it only bated breath?</v>

3596
02:42:41.371 --> 02:42:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I've only heard it used in context of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bated breath,</v>

3597
02:42:43.800 --> 02:42:46.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very bizarre word.</v>

3598
02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:50.280
<v Speaker 1>If it's only used with breath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

3599
02:42:50.610 --> 02:42:53.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people are so good with words.</v>

3600
02:42:53.100 --> 02:42:53.933
<v Speaker 1>Like I was listening to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading the lyrics of Bob Dylan's </v>

3601
02:42:57.030 --> 02:42:58.860
<v Speaker 1>a after we won a Nobel prize for </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>

3602
02:42:58.950 --> 02:42:59.783
<v Speaker 1>Solipsistic solipsistic means means </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially that you can only be sure </v>

3603
02:43:03.631 --> 02:43:07.170
<v Speaker 1>that you exist and you're not even sure </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody else use theory that the self is</v>

3604
02:43:07.171 --> 02:43:09.660
<v Speaker 1>all that can be known to exist.</v>

3605
02:43:09.750 --> 02:43:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird word.</v>

3606
02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:14.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a very limited view of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed Bob.</v>

3607
02:43:14.411 --> 02:43:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Dylan won't respond to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people trying to give him his prize.</v>

3608
02:43:17.380 --> 02:43:20.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like Bob Dylan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck off.</v>

3609
02:43:20.860 --> 02:43:21.693
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the lyrics of chimes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom and and look at what he was </v>

3610
02:43:25.721 --> 02:43:28.140
<v Speaker 1>writing when he was in his twenties to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take a look at an Indian.</v>

3611
02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:31.450
<v Speaker 1>He had an interview I listened to and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were talking about these lyrics and</v>

3612
02:43:31.451 --> 02:43:32.610
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something he said,</v>

3613
02:43:32.620 --> 02:43:33.453
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

3614
02:43:33.460 --> 02:43:35.800
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea how I wrote that and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could never do it again.</v>

3615
02:43:35.830 --> 02:43:38.170
<v Speaker 1>That magic is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>

3616
02:43:38.171 --> 02:43:39.004
<v Speaker 1>people look me up and they'll come out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and asked me about organic farming and </v>

3617
02:43:41.441 --> 02:43:42.780
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you know about organic farming?</v>

3618
02:43:42.790 --> 02:43:43.623
<v Speaker 1>He was absolutely nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just put all this stuff on him </v>

3619
02:43:46.211 --> 02:43:49.090
<v Speaker 1>because he was a great lyricist and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great thinker.</v>

3620
02:43:49.090 --> 02:43:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Obviously he wrote all along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>watchtower.</v>

3621
02:43:51.310 --> 02:43:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Hell yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote,</v>

3622
02:43:52.510 --> 02:43:53.343
<v Speaker 1>he was such a fucking influence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>springsteen was just doing a BBC </v>

3623
02:43:55.541 --> 02:43:56.374
<v Speaker 1>interview and he said it was the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time I'd ever heard anybody describe </v>

3624
02:44:00.851 --> 02:44:01.684
<v Speaker 1>America the way it really was looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far between sundowns finished and </v>

3625
02:44:06.761 --> 02:44:09.580
<v Speaker 1>midnights broken tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ducked inside the doorway,</v>

3626
02:44:09.610 --> 02:44:10.443
<v Speaker 1>thunder crashing as majestic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bells of bolts struck shadows in the </v>

3627
02:44:13.421 --> 02:44:17.050
<v Speaker 1>sounds seeming to be the chimes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom flashing.</v>

3628
02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:17.771
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

3629
02:44:17.771 --> 02:44:20.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an interesting voice of a generation.</v>

3630
02:44:20.210 --> 02:44:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flashing for the warriors whose strength</v>

3631
02:44:22.661 --> 02:44:23.494
<v Speaker 1>is not to fight flashing for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>refugees on an unarmed road of flight </v>

3632
02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:31.750
<v Speaker 1>and for each and every underdog soldier </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the night as we gazed upon the chimes</v>

3633
02:44:31.751 --> 02:44:32.584
<v Speaker 1>of freedom flashing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a young guy reading it because I </v>

3634
02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:36.520
<v Speaker 1>read a book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

3635
02:44:36.521 --> 02:44:37.350
<v Speaker 1>It's probably high as fuck.</v>

3636
02:44:37.350 --> 02:44:39.130
<v Speaker 1>And he ruined all those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he was.</v>

3637
02:44:39.250 --> 02:44:41.680
<v Speaker 1>How dare you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think he was doing drugs?</v>

3638
02:44:42.070 --> 02:44:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Bob Dylan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3639
02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:45.480
<v Speaker 1>itch please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3640
02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:46.300
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3641
02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:48.860
<v Speaker 1>I think mom was doing drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

3642
02:44:48.980 --> 02:44:49.813
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about of Shit for </v>

3643
02:44:51.071 --> 02:44:52.290
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>

3644
02:44:52.310 --> 02:44:55.900
<v Speaker 1>He was smoking weed and Lsd for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

3645
02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>La,</v>

3646
02:44:56.470 --> 02:44:59.740
<v Speaker 1>who's that rock historian who said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rock and roll is the greatest.</v>

3647
02:44:59.741 --> 02:45:00.574
<v Speaker 1>When they were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were doing psychedelics and they </v>

3648
02:45:02.501 --> 02:45:05.800
<v Speaker 1>were smoking weed and cocaine and heroin</v>
<v Speaker 1>came in.</v>

3649
02:45:06.010 --> 02:45:09.070
<v Speaker 1>It was when the music pat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when Lou Reed and that's when all</v>

3650
02:45:09.071 --> 02:45:10.870
<v Speaker 1>those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mamas and Papas and all those guys,</v>

3651
02:45:11.320 --> 02:45:12.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after Haight Ashbury,</v>

3652
02:45:12.731 --> 02:45:17.731
<v Speaker 1>I think 1968 that that when when heroin </v>
<v Speaker 1>and marijuana and cocaine came in,</v>

3653
02:45:18.220 --> 02:45:20.750
<v Speaker 1>the music basically died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of time was smoked.</v>

3654
02:45:20.790 --> 02:45:21.623
<v Speaker 1>Says according to Eric von Schmidt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the early sixties contemporary of </v>

3655
02:45:24.221 --> 02:45:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Dylan's in the Cambridge folk scene.</v>

3656
02:45:27.120 --> 02:45:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Cambridge folk scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good Lord.</v>

3657
02:45:29.560 --> 02:45:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Smells like feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where he dylan in a singing pow.</v>

3658
02:45:32.831 --> 02:45:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Richard Farina usually got together a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of pot with smoke,</v>

3659
02:45:35.681 --> 02:45:37.150
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably just doing a lot of pot,</v>

3660
02:45:37.510 --> 02:45:38.343
<v Speaker 1>but if they were doing a lot of pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you they did some acid to </v>

3661
02:45:40.810 --> 02:45:41.643
<v Speaker 1>get ahold of some mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Psychedelics and we'd probably are not </v>

3662
02:45:44.411 --> 02:45:45.244
<v Speaker 1>going to be your enemies as an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine heroin and cocaine </v>

3663
02:45:49.990 --> 02:45:50.823
<v Speaker 1>don't usually they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When do you think it's going to come a </v>

3664
02:45:53.351 --> 02:45:57.790
<v Speaker 1>day when we require that of politicians?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We require psychedelic experiences.</v>

3665
02:45:57.791 --> 02:45:58.624
<v Speaker 1>Like we require education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Bob Dylan turned the Beatles on to </v>

3666
02:46:01.391 --> 02:46:02.770
<v Speaker 1>marijuana while you got them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

3667
02:46:03.180 --> 02:46:04.560
<v Speaker 1>this is outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3668
02:46:04.810 --> 02:46:08.050
<v Speaker 1>when do you think it's going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>requirement for politicians?</v>

3669
02:46:08.051 --> 02:46:08.884
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think every politician should have a </v>

3670
02:46:09.711 --> 02:46:10.040
<v Speaker 1>mushroom</v>

3671
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:12.350
<v Speaker 4>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's a lot to ask.</v>

3672
02:46:12.380 --> 02:46:13.213
<v Speaker 4>I think you should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should have to have survived us </v>

3673
02:46:16.190 --> 02:46:20.390
<v Speaker 4>threshold braking experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a real breakthrough experience.</v>

3674
02:46:20.540 --> 02:46:21.373
<v Speaker 4>I would start with politicians having to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go to another country for awhile and </v>

3675
02:46:23.511 --> 02:46:26.090
<v Speaker 4>just seeing how people keep them here at</v>
<v Speaker 4>dose him up.</v>

3676
02:46:26.091 --> 02:46:27.110
<v Speaker 4>Fuck all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Travel.</v>

3677
02:46:27.260 --> 02:46:29.410
<v Speaker 4>Travel's dangerous doses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just doses.</v>

3678
02:46:29.570 --> 02:46:30.403
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just fucking put them in a room for a </v>

3679
02:46:31.671 --> 02:46:33.110
<v Speaker 4>bunch of people are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Watch the doors.</v>

3680
02:46:33.440 --> 02:46:35.060
<v Speaker 4>Keep them in place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Turn the lights off.</v>

3681
02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:38.840
<v Speaker 4>Keep keep them silent and just dose the </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit out of them.</v>

3682
02:46:38.900 --> 02:46:39.733
<v Speaker 4>I just think we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all know everybody that's had one </v>

3683
02:46:43.270 --> 02:46:45.350
<v Speaker 4>that knows that there's giant benefits </v>
<v Speaker 4>to them,</v>

3684
02:46:45.500 --> 02:46:46.333
<v Speaker 4>but it's poo pooed in society as being </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a drug that's detrimental to your </v>

3685
02:46:49.671 --> 02:46:52.400
<v Speaker 4>health.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's detrimental to your,</v>

3686
02:46:52.401 --> 02:46:57.401
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your function as a kid or you don't know</v>

3687
02:46:57.561 --> 02:46:58.610
<v Speaker 4>where that droves coming from.</v>

3688
02:46:58.610 --> 02:47:01.640
<v Speaker 4>So that's why change it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was legal,</v>

3689
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:04.670
<v Speaker 4>used to be right and sure until Nixon </v>
<v Speaker 4>that fuck.</v>

3690
02:47:05.120 --> 02:47:05.953
<v Speaker 4>Nixon fucked up a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People don't realize like when people </v>

3691
02:47:07.401 --> 02:47:08.990
<v Speaker 4>were doing an ass in the fifties and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sixties,</v>

3692
02:47:09.220 --> 02:47:11.390
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't even illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3693
02:47:11.391 --> 02:47:13.640
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marijuana was illegal,</v>

3694
02:47:13.700 --> 02:47:16.190
<v Speaker 4>but mushrooms weren't illegal until </v>
<v Speaker 4>1970.</v>

3695
02:47:16.220 --> 02:47:17.450
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3696
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:18.343
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's still stuff that's not </v>

3697
02:47:19.370 --> 02:47:20.203
<v Speaker 4>technically illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's way more powerful than that five </v>

3698
02:47:22.851 --> 02:47:26.480
<v Speaker 4>methoxy DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You used to be able to buy it.</v>

3699
02:47:26.690 --> 02:47:29.750
<v Speaker 4>Not for human consumption from chemical </v>
<v Speaker 4>companies online.</v>

3700
02:47:30.250 --> 02:47:34.040
<v Speaker 4>He used to be able to buy like a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>coffee tumbler full of it.</v>

3701
02:47:34.070 --> 02:47:34.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not joking.</v>

3702
02:47:34.790 --> 02:47:37.640
<v Speaker 4>You could smoke and meanwhile and </v>
<v Speaker 4>effective dose.</v>

3703
02:47:37.670 --> 02:47:38.503
<v Speaker 4>It's five Meo DMT is in more potent </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic ounce per ounce gram per </v>

3704
02:47:43.701 --> 02:47:47.270
<v Speaker 4>gram than nn dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the most potent,</v>

3705
02:47:47.630 --> 02:47:50.300
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't have the visuals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it doesn't give you the visuals,</v>

3706
02:47:50.301 --> 02:47:51.650
<v Speaker 4>but as far as like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3707
02:47:51.770 --> 02:47:53.990
<v Speaker 4>effective dose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the most potent,</v>

3708
02:47:54.260 --> 02:47:58.160
<v Speaker 4>so a small amount can get you fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and used to be able to buy that stuff.</v>

3709
02:47:58.430 --> 02:47:59.780
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pot was illegal.</v>

3710
02:47:59.870 --> 02:48:04.490
<v Speaker 4>You used to be able to buy five Meo dmt </v>
<v Speaker 4>online and if you smoke did,</v>

3711
02:48:04.491 --> 02:48:07.610
<v Speaker 4>you just got shot through a cannon to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the center of the universe.</v>

3712
02:48:07.611 --> 02:48:08.444
<v Speaker 4>We cease to exist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the terrifying trip because you </v>

3713
02:48:10.971 --> 02:48:11.804
<v Speaker 4>absolutely thought you were dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you absolutely ceased to exist and </v>

3714
02:48:14.601 --> 02:48:19.040
<v Speaker 4>you became one with everything and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a very weird non visual experience.</v>

3715
02:48:19.310 --> 02:48:23.150
<v Speaker 4>Whereas DMT is filled with all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>patterns and this beautiful feeling that</v>

3716
02:48:23.151 --> 02:48:28.151
<v Speaker 4>you get the five Meo dmt is like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful white geometry.</v>

3717
02:48:28.941 --> 02:48:29.774
<v Speaker 4>It's all just pale white and all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird sort of microscopic fractal </v>

3718
02:48:34.461 --> 02:48:37.520
<v Speaker 4>geometric patterns that are sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dancing around you.</v>

3719
02:48:37.521 --> 02:48:39.830
<v Speaker 4>But one thing is invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what do you,</v>

3720
02:48:39.831 --> 02:48:42.560
<v Speaker 4>what do you like about psychedelics?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think,</v>

3721
02:48:42.890 --> 02:48:45.410
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is typically the benefit of the second?</v>

3722
02:48:45.430 --> 02:48:46.263
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a lot of benefits to any</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience and extreme experiences give </v>

3723
02:48:50.601 --> 02:48:51.500
<v Speaker 4>you more benefits.</v>

3724
02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:56.800
<v Speaker 4>You take in more data knowing that that </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelic experience is possible.</v>

3725
02:48:57.140 --> 02:48:59.600
<v Speaker 4>Just knowing that that experience that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can hit,</v>

3726
02:49:00.050 --> 02:49:02.390
<v Speaker 4>you can hit that note that you can get </v>
<v Speaker 4>into that,</v>

3727
02:49:02.450 --> 02:49:04.550
<v Speaker 4>that dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever the fuck it is in a psychedelic</v>

3728
02:49:04.551 --> 02:49:05.384
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes you look at the that is </v>

3729
02:49:08.791 --> 02:49:11.340
<v Speaker 4>unchanging around you without drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes you go,</v>

3730
02:49:11.430 --> 02:49:12.263
<v Speaker 4>oh well this isn't all there is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's another thing that you can </v>

3731
02:49:15.511 --> 02:49:16.344
<v Speaker 4>get to really easily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get to this other thing really </v>

3732
02:49:18.271 --> 02:49:23.271
<v Speaker 4>easily and although it's not regular </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyday drive through starbucks,</v>

3733
02:49:23.461 --> 02:49:26.790
<v Speaker 4>stuck in traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>waiting for your phone call,</v>

3734
02:49:26.890 --> 02:49:29.340
<v Speaker 4>so the alarm goes off in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to get up.</v>

3735
02:49:29.341 --> 02:49:30.174
<v Speaker 4>It's not that world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's still an accessible world </v>

3736
02:49:32.761 --> 02:49:34.410
<v Speaker 4>that's right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's mindblowing.</v>

3737
02:49:34.440 --> 02:49:36.520
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what you said Eagle dissolvent,</v>

3738
02:49:36.521 --> 02:49:40.800
<v Speaker 4>but even prior to that is the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 4>it shows you what is possible or what is</v>

3739
02:49:40.801 --> 02:49:41.490
<v Speaker 4>out there.</v>

3740
02:49:41.490 --> 02:49:42.323
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's to me the most important element </v>

3741
02:49:45.961 --> 02:49:46.794
<v Speaker 4>for change in a person's consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you are shown that there is a </v>

3742
02:49:51.661 --> 02:49:55.410
<v Speaker 4>higher bar or you're shown that there </v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

3743
02:49:55.440 --> 02:49:56.273
<v Speaker 4>there are other possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more illuminating possibilities because </v>

3744
02:49:59.011 --> 02:49:59.844
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times you can live in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a world where your vision of reality </v>

3745
02:50:03.601 --> 02:50:04.434
<v Speaker 4>that's given to you and that's that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're privy to on a daily basis is so </v>

3746
02:50:08.101 --> 02:50:08.934
<v Speaker 4>limited that you don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to be shown that there is </v>

3747
02:50:12.150 --> 02:50:14.580
<v Speaker 4>something higher to aspire to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3748
02:50:14.610 --> 02:50:15.570
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3749
02:50:15.571 --> 02:50:16.404
<v Speaker 4>And so I think that's kind of the value.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's one of the biggest values </v>

3750
02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:20.513
<v Speaker 4>to quote unquote education or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>biggest value to exposing yourself to </v>

3751
02:50:24.690 --> 02:50:25.523
<v Speaker 4>experiences like you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think both of them are valid and both </v>

3752
02:50:28.741 --> 02:50:29.574
<v Speaker 4>of them are important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you should have like difficult </v>

3753
02:50:31.321 --> 02:50:31.750
<v Speaker 4>tests.</v>

3754
02:50:31.750 --> 02:50:33.840
<v Speaker 4>I think it's probably good for people to</v>
<v Speaker 4>try to run a marathon.</v>

3755
02:50:34.080 --> 02:50:36.240
<v Speaker 4>I think that's good for people to try to</v>
<v Speaker 4>rock climb.</v>

3756
02:50:36.241 --> 02:50:39.270
<v Speaker 4>I think it's good for people to go on </v>
<v Speaker 4>long difficult hikes.</v>

3757
02:50:39.271 --> 02:50:40.104
<v Speaker 4>I think you learn from that just like </v>
<v Speaker 4>you learn from education and I don't </v>

3758
02:50:43.171 --> 02:50:45.330
<v Speaker 4>think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're mutually exclusive</v>

3759
02:50:45.331 --> 02:50:48.450
<v Speaker 4>and I think they combined together for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>balanced person,</v>

3760
02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:49.553
<v Speaker 4>a person who tries to do and tries to </v>
<v Speaker 4>accomplish difficult things along with </v>

3761
02:50:53.100 --> 02:50:53.933
<v Speaker 4>becoming educated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is that this whole </v>

3762
02:50:56.911 --> 02:50:57.744
<v Speaker 4>competitive thing that arises amongst </v>
<v Speaker 4>people where you want to be the best at </v>

3763
02:51:00.751 --> 02:51:04.560
<v Speaker 4>something like we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which sort of defines you in this way,</v>

3764
02:51:04.561 --> 02:51:09.561
<v Speaker 4>that requires a lot of tunnel vision and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it requires you to not be fully balanced</v>

3765
02:51:10.381 --> 02:51:11.800
<v Speaker 4>and not be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3766
02:51:11.820 --> 02:51:13.980
<v Speaker 4>one of the things I had a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was teaching,</v>

3767
02:51:14.040 --> 02:51:15.890
<v Speaker 4>when I teach martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3768
02:51:16.060 --> 02:51:16.893
<v Speaker 4>I noticed that smart people were way </v>
<v Speaker 4>more nervous before fights and I was </v>

3769
02:51:21.181 --> 02:51:22.014
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3770
02:51:22.140 --> 02:51:22.973
<v Speaker 4>I see what's going on.</v>

3771
02:51:23.220 --> 02:51:27.780
<v Speaker 4>They are aware of the variables like </v>
<v Speaker 4>whereas these dumb people that you would</v>

3772
02:51:27.781 --> 02:51:29.750
<v Speaker 4>teach or the people that weren't as </v>
<v Speaker 4>smart awareness,</v>

3773
02:51:29.760 --> 02:51:30.593
<v Speaker 4>curious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't have nearly as much of a </v>

3774
02:51:31.771 --> 02:51:33.240
<v Speaker 4>problem with competing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3775
02:51:33.241 --> 02:51:34.074
<v Speaker 4>this is really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this really smart people are aware </v>

3776
02:51:37.531 --> 02:51:39.840
<v Speaker 4>of almost too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3777
02:51:39.841 --> 02:51:40.674
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>David Foster Wallace in this incredible </v>

3778
02:51:41.761 --> 02:51:44.040
<v Speaker 4>essay called how Tracy Austin broke my </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart.</v>

3779
02:51:45.200 --> 02:51:46.033
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really story about Tracy Austin </v>

3780
02:51:47.251 --> 02:51:49.300
<v Speaker 4>when she won Wimbledon at 14.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3781
02:51:49.450 --> 02:51:54.450
<v Speaker 4>and and he said then she wrote a book </v>
<v Speaker 4>like on her experience and trying to get</v>

3782
02:51:54.541 --> 02:51:57.180
<v Speaker 4>a physical genius to describe what they </v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

3783
02:51:57.270 --> 02:52:00.330
<v Speaker 4>Part of the reason that they performed </v>
<v Speaker 4>so well under pressure.</v>

3784
02:52:00.331 --> 02:52:02.610
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes it's not because they're dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but their brain,</v>

3785
02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:06.130
<v Speaker 4>they don't have the kind of mine that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>writer would have,</v>

3786
02:52:06.130 --> 02:52:06.963
<v Speaker 1>which is to ask a thousand questions to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be introspective to the point where </v>

3787
02:52:10.200 --> 02:52:13.240
<v Speaker 1>you're essentially neurotic or going </v>
<v Speaker 1>around in a circle.</v>

3788
02:52:13.241 --> 02:52:16.450
<v Speaker 1>You can't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to be able to shut that down.</v>

3789
02:52:16.451 --> 02:52:17.284
<v Speaker 1>That's why when they ask great athletes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to describe what was going on in their </v>

3790
02:52:20.171 --> 02:52:21.004
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they got that ball over the end </v>

3791
02:52:22.991 --> 02:52:23.824
<v Speaker 1>zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's invariably kind of disappointing </v>

3792
02:52:25.811 --> 02:52:27.490
<v Speaker 1>because they never really know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain it.</v>

3793
02:52:27.491 --> 02:52:28.324
<v Speaker 1>What they say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just knew I had to get the football </v>

3794
02:52:29.620 --> 02:52:32.230
<v Speaker 1>cross line and we just executed and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>team was there.</v>

3795
02:52:32.440 --> 02:52:33.273
<v Speaker 1>It's not hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did this thing recently about </v>

3796
02:52:35.411 --> 02:52:38.320
<v Speaker 1>climbing this area of Yosemite that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly different.</v>

3797
02:52:38.440 --> 02:52:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Difficult to pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

3798
02:52:40.130 --> 02:52:40.963
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

3799
02:52:41.050 --> 02:52:42.670
<v Speaker 1>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just released.</v>

3800
02:52:42.760 --> 02:52:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I think the video is called heaven </v>
<v Speaker 1>something heaven.</v>

3801
02:52:45.970 --> 02:52:48.460
<v Speaker 1>Alex honnold heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's very.</v>

3802
02:52:48.461 --> 02:52:52.780
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about as he's moving and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing these years.</v>

3803
02:52:52.810 --> 02:52:55.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just executing and he goes,</v>

3804
02:52:55.451 --> 02:52:59.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm just executing the movements and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's literally upside down climbing this</v>

3805
02:52:59.381 --> 02:53:01.140
<v Speaker 1>thing thousands of feet up in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

3806
02:53:01.390 --> 02:53:02.223
<v Speaker 1>It's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you watch them do that and you're </v>

3807
02:53:04.001 --> 02:53:04.391
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3808
02:53:04.391 --> 02:53:05.224
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess he knows what he's doing </v>

3809
02:53:07.660 --> 02:53:10.510
<v Speaker 1>and he's done it before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you watch him do it,</v>

3810
02:53:10.990 --> 02:53:11.823
<v Speaker 1>he free Solos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heaven that's experiential is hard to </v>

3811
02:53:15.281 --> 02:53:16.150
<v Speaker 1>put into words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3812
02:53:16.600 --> 02:53:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

3813
02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:21.960
<v Speaker 1>he's the ultimate experiential guru.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy who you.</v>

3814
02:53:21.970 --> 02:53:24.820
<v Speaker 1>But look what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God is not using.</v>

3815
02:53:24.900 --> 02:53:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't use any ropes.</v>

3816
02:53:27.240 --> 02:53:27.940
<v Speaker 1>You look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3817
02:53:27.940 --> 02:53:29.440
<v Speaker 1>it's heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what it's called.</v>

3818
02:53:29.441 --> 02:53:32.320
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you see how he's climbing this thing,</v>

3819
02:53:32.720 --> 02:53:34.270
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one area.</v>

3820
02:53:34.271 --> 02:53:35.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what mountain is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are.</v>

3821
02:53:35.890 --> 02:53:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it is El Capitan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that?</v>

3822
02:53:37.570 --> 02:53:39.910
<v Speaker 1>I think that's El Capitan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's all cat.</v>

3823
02:53:40.310 --> 02:53:43.270
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he's doing is he's climbing up.</v>

3824
02:53:43.590 --> 02:53:47.050
<v Speaker 1>If it's not straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's leaned back.</v>

3825
02:53:47.410 --> 02:53:48.243
<v Speaker 1>So he's hanging as he's climbing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's climbing thousands of feet above </v>

3826
02:53:54.941 --> 02:53:56.380
<v Speaker 1>the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like look at the trees below him there.</v>

3827
02:53:56.620 --> 02:53:57.453
<v Speaker 1>Look at that fucking picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they find guys that fall off El </v>

3828
02:54:00.510 --> 02:54:01.343
<v Speaker 1>Cap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't really find much of their </v>

3829
02:54:01.841 --> 02:54:02.674
<v Speaker 1>body apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find out if that's the name of this </v>

3830
02:54:03.941 --> 02:54:07.090
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many pull ups can he do?</v>

3831
02:54:07.091 --> 02:54:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Did you ask him to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know.</v>

3832
02:54:09.940 --> 02:54:10.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you told me.</v>

3833
02:54:11.050 --> 02:54:15.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm so nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say what the mountain is.</v>

3834
02:54:16.480 --> 02:54:18.150
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's Yosemite.</v>

3835
02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Just carry a small shoot on the back of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his body.</v>

3836
02:54:20.621 --> 02:54:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Please just go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3837
02:54:23.800 --> 02:54:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Well He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3838
02:54:24.610 --> 02:54:25.610
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no shoots.</v>

3839
02:54:25.730 --> 02:54:27.280
<v Speaker 1>There's no shoots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no getting out here.</v>

3840
02:54:27.310 --> 02:54:28.143
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows what he's doing and he can do </v>

3841
02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:30.460
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3842
02:54:30.460 --> 02:54:31.293
<v Speaker 1>Who's done it before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of free solo climber </v>

3843
02:54:33.160 --> 02:54:36.880
<v Speaker 1>dudes that see the stuff that he does </v>
<v Speaker 1>and even old school climbers,</v>

3844
02:54:37.090 --> 02:54:38.860
<v Speaker 1>they go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a matter of if,</v>

3845
02:54:38.890 --> 02:54:40.870
<v Speaker 1>it's when it's a matter of when there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was this whole,</v>

3846
02:54:40.930 --> 02:54:43.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>television show they did about it,</v>

3847
02:54:43.900 --> 02:54:46.780
<v Speaker 1>where there's these old school climber </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys were kind of upset with them.</v>

3848
02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:49.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking that what he's doing is</v>

3849
02:54:49.210 --> 02:54:51.700
<v Speaker 1>taking far too many risks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't think so.</v>

3850
02:54:51.701 --> 02:54:54.010
<v Speaker 1>He thinks he knows what he's doing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows how to do it well.</v>

3851
02:54:54.100 --> 02:54:54.933
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine the route is called </v>

3852
02:54:56.471 --> 02:54:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Heaven at glacier point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glacier point is the mountain.</v>

3853
02:54:59.200 --> 02:55:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine the feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by the way,</v>

3854
02:55:01.510 --> 02:55:03.040
<v Speaker 1>good job Brian Gallon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched I,</v>

3855
02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:04.150
<v Speaker 1>one piece of stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3856
02:55:04.190 --> 02:55:06.010
<v Speaker 1>it looks like Al Capp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've fucking,</v>

3857
02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:06.913
<v Speaker 1>I've climbed 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're both wrong about 100 things in a </v>

3858
02:55:09.171 --> 02:55:11.840
<v Speaker 1>podcast all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but harmful jamie here with the google.</v>

3859
02:55:11.840 --> 02:55:13.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure my uranium one will get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3860
02:55:13.850 --> 02:55:17.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they had some picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3861
02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:19.460
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3862
02:55:19.461 --> 02:55:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Look at that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

3863
02:55:20.930 --> 02:55:22.940
<v Speaker 1>On what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

3864
02:55:22.941 --> 02:55:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Is that a 45 degree angle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3865
02:55:25.041 --> 02:55:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's horrifying.</v>

3866
02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:27.193
<v Speaker 1>Is that Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would know is that it's close to a </v>

3867
02:55:28.761 --> 02:55:31.310
<v Speaker 1>45 degree and not get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does have you ever rock climbed?</v>

3868
02:55:31.810 --> 02:55:33.320
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the most exhausting thing.</v>

3869
02:55:33.740 --> 02:55:38.740
<v Speaker 1>You your fingers and hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you get so pumped so quickly that</v>

3870
02:55:38.841 --> 02:55:39.330
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3871
02:55:39.330 --> 02:55:40.163
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you literally can't use your hands and </v>

3872
02:55:41.241 --> 02:55:42.074
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking to you as very fat fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really interesting cause he's </v>

3873
02:55:44.611 --> 02:55:46.580
<v Speaker 1>a very thin guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did the podcast.</v>

3874
02:55:46.960 --> 02:55:47.793
<v Speaker 1>I know when I was talking to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his asked him to show me his hands </v>

3875
02:55:50.421 --> 02:55:51.620
<v Speaker 1>because you have fat fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3876
02:55:51.621 --> 02:55:52.460
<v Speaker 1>He's a friend of mine.</v>

3877
02:55:52.490 --> 02:55:53.800
<v Speaker 1>Got Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't have.</v>

3878
02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're not small hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the way do you think?</v>

3879
02:55:56.510 --> 02:55:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Very light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3880
02:55:57.430 --> 02:55:58.730
<v Speaker 1>It was probably 1:50</v>
<v Speaker 1>tall.</v>

3881
02:55:58.790 --> 02:56:01.070
<v Speaker 1>If I had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably like a five,</v>

3882
02:56:01.071 --> 02:56:02.000
<v Speaker 1>11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six feet.</v>

3883
02:56:02.150 --> 02:56:05.510
<v Speaker 1>How tall is he fucking done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude?</v>

3884
02:56:05.540 --> 02:56:07.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to know what his body type.</v>

3885
02:56:08.090 --> 02:56:08.923
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a real light and long and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thin and strong for that kind of stuff </v>

3886
02:56:12.591 --> 02:56:13.424
<v Speaker 1>because all the time and he just knows </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to climb and he knows what he's </v>

3887
02:56:15.801 --> 02:56:18.500
<v Speaker 1>doing and he stays super calm while he </v>
<v Speaker 1>does it.</v>

3888
02:56:18.501 --> 02:56:19.910
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasized.</v>

3889
02:56:19.970 --> 02:56:21.290
<v Speaker 1>This is him at the very top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

3890
02:56:21.291 --> 02:56:23.870
<v Speaker 1>look how every movement is like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>measured.</v>

3891
02:56:25.250 --> 02:56:26.270
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the master.</v>

3892
02:56:26.390 --> 02:56:29.180
<v Speaker 1>He's a master at that kind of stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he lives in a van.</v>

3893
02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:31.910
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lives in his van and he drives around</v>

3894
02:56:31.911 --> 02:56:32.960
<v Speaker 1>and just finds places.</v>

3895
02:56:32.960 --> 02:56:35.690
<v Speaker 1>Parks and climbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's incredible.</v>

3896
02:56:35.910 --> 02:56:37.040
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really is.</v>

3897
02:56:37.100 --> 02:56:40.260
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like Samurai or something freak,</v>

3898
02:56:40.310 --> 02:56:41.450
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

3899
02:56:41.451 --> 02:56:42.284
<v Speaker 1>he's made this name by being this guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>who does the dangerous scary climbing </v>

3900
02:56:45.171 --> 02:56:47.810
<v Speaker 1>stuff that nobody wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I read that book,</v>

3901
02:56:47.811 --> 02:56:51.860
<v Speaker 1>the Book of five rings by me and month </v>
<v Speaker 1>Masashi like I got the same sense that,</v>

3902
02:56:51.861 --> 02:56:54.620
<v Speaker 1>that was the experiential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his life,</v>

3903
02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:57.740
<v Speaker 1>the margin for error in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sword fight.</v>

3904
02:56:58.250 --> 02:57:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also he said how you practice has to</v>

3905
02:57:01.521 --> 02:57:06.410
<v Speaker 1>be almost life and death like until </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're no longer doing it,</v>

3906
02:57:06.411 --> 02:57:06.981
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3907
02:57:06.981 --> 02:57:10.520
<v Speaker 1>the extreme notion of living always on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the edge.</v>

3908
02:57:11.300 --> 02:57:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

3909
02:57:12.980 --> 02:57:17.980
<v Speaker 1>that feels like the exact same path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindset and probably probably result.</v>

3910
02:57:20.901 --> 02:57:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've got a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

3911
02:57:22.310 --> 02:57:24.240
<v Speaker 1>God forbid he dies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the appearance seems,</v>

3912
02:57:24.250 --> 02:57:29.210
<v Speaker 1>see sort of when that becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessity or that becomes,</v>

3913
02:57:29.480 --> 02:57:30.313
<v Speaker 1>I guess how you or what you crave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of intimate relationship </v>

3914
02:57:36.981 --> 02:57:37.820
<v Speaker 1>between life and death.</v>

3915
02:57:37.850 --> 02:57:38.661
<v Speaker 1>This sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3916
02:57:38.661 --> 02:57:39.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he craves,</v>

3917
02:57:39.711 --> 02:57:40.544
<v Speaker 1>is doing it like getting some slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The flow you get into it knowing that </v>

3918
02:57:44.031 --> 02:57:44.864
<v Speaker 1>there's a massive risk behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still being able to execute </v>

3919
02:57:47.121 --> 02:57:48.980
<v Speaker 1>flawlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he craves,</v>

3920
02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:49.833
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And instead of it being a sword coming </v>

3921
02:57:50.931 --> 02:57:52.760
<v Speaker 1>out of him that he has to check instead </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

3922
02:57:52.761 --> 02:57:53.594
<v Speaker 1>it's him figuring out how to climb a 45 </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree face that's hanging 2000 feet </v>

3923
02:57:57.831 --> 02:57:59.780
<v Speaker 1>above the ground or whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is.</v>

3924
02:58:00.170 --> 02:58:01.890
<v Speaker 1>How many feet do you think that is above</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground?</v>

3925
02:58:01.980 --> 02:58:03.990
<v Speaker 1>When you look down and see those trees </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the background,</v>

3926
02:58:03.991 --> 02:58:05.840
<v Speaker 1>it looks like more than 2000 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3927
02:58:05.850 --> 02:58:07.890
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many feet do you think you can climb</v>

3928
02:58:07.891 --> 02:58:09.390
<v Speaker 1>in a day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3929
02:58:09.391 --> 02:58:11.760
<v Speaker 1>because a mile is what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five thousand feet?</v>

3930
02:58:11.790 --> 02:58:14.700
<v Speaker 1>500 something feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a mile is 1000,</v>

3931
02:58:14.701 --> 02:58:16.950
<v Speaker 1>300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>434,000,</v>

3932

<v Speaker 1>280 yards.</v>

3933
02:58:20.260 --> 02:58:21.360
<v Speaker 1>losses.</v>

3934
02:58:21.370 --> 02:58:23.850
<v Speaker 1>along with yards to fuck 3000 foot </v>
<v Speaker 1>vertical wall.</v>

3935
02:58:27.810 --> 02:58:30.600
<v Speaker 1>So almost a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got like three quarters of a mile up.</v>

3936
02:58:30.630 --> 02:58:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred feet above the crown in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that over overhang with me and 40 feet.</v>
