52
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of supplements.</v>

53
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Some people aren't and I completely and </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally understand that.</v>

54
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.130
<v Speaker 1>If you're curious though about </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplements and curious of the benefits </v>

55
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.101
<v Speaker 1>of supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the benefits are </v>

56
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>substantial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you pay attention to.</v>

57
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always going to be weird fat </v>

58
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.561
<v Speaker 1>loss claims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you guys seen all this shit with Dr </v>

59
00:03:00.561 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Oz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Oz's fuck dude,</v>

60
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.270
<v Speaker 1>he's bought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brought that guy in front of </v>

61
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brought him in.</v>

62
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.690
<v Speaker 1>That's not good son because he's a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a.</v>

63
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.700
<v Speaker 1>he's a creepy liar saying he's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>miracle cures and these little berries </v>

64
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 1>that they make pills out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give him kickbacks.</v>

65
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Doctors are human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

66
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.620
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes doctors do creepy shit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a creepy fuck.</v>

67
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.620
<v Speaker 1>The fat thing to me is it's insidious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's extra creepy because people like </v>

68
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>the fat thing is a self esteem thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a discipline thing.</v>

69
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a health thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much connected to fat.</v>

70
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

71
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 1>it drives me more nutty than people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are claiming the making your dick bigger</v>

72
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.880
<v Speaker 1>because that's just so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you bought big Dick Pills,</v>

73
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:47.030
<v Speaker 1>he's just an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 1>but the fat thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

75
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:53.761
<v Speaker 1>you're sad and you're just thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could just get rid of all this </v>

76
00:03:53.761 --> 00:03:57.121
<v Speaker 1>extra me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the porn of vitamins and </v>

77
00:03:57.121 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 1>supplements though that sells the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of any other thing that you'll ever see.</v>

78
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 1>That's why they always have like </v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrities like Anna Nicole Smith,</v>

79
00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Dr Phil and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that.</v>

80
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Or I may not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Ross and I'm sure Dr Phil does salt </v>

81
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.060
<v Speaker 1>you need to do to make your relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>birders lose some fucking white.</v>

82
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>You've got to wonder what it is about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor getting on TV as well.</v>

83
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was talking to,</v>

85
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:24.991
<v Speaker 1>I'm a researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a friend of mine from up in Canada and </v>

86
00:04:24.991 --> 00:04:28.440
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always have to know it was his take </v>

87
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.440
<v Speaker 1>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there becomes an issue.</v>

88
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Even with like super intelligent people </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you become a celebrity when you </v>

89
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 1>were a celebrity doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a celebrity astronomer,</v>

90
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.900
<v Speaker 1>where your celebrity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

91
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>that there's the pitfalls of fame that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall into that and the monetary benefits</v>

92
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.490
<v Speaker 1>of twisting information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In one way or another,</v>

93
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like with Dr Oz is doing,</v>

94
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:48.970
<v Speaker 1>he's obviously getting paid by these </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

95
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Say that they have these fat pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's so stupid,</v>

96
00:04:52.721 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They asked him,</v>

97
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 1>would you say that a pill is a miracle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

98
00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:58.090
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

99
00:04:58.091 --> 00:04:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Well I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:04:58.701 --> 00:04:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I took the word miracle.</v>

101
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you certainly couldn't say a miracle in </v>

102
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 1>terms of you sat miracle on your show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You fuckhead more than one.</v>

103

<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>

104
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.780
<v Speaker 1>the new guy on Hbo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's The new guy in Israel with the </v>

105
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.780
<v Speaker 1>glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Oliver.</v>

106
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I trust people with English accent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>glasses implicitly.</v>

107
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.580
<v Speaker 1>Immediately trust those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's really good at his shows.</v>

108
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did a fantastic thing breaking </v>

109
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.600
<v Speaker 1>down what a scumbag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Oz's,</v>

110
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.860

<v Speaker 1>sometimes you see those infomercials </v>

111
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.091
<v Speaker 1>where there'll be a doctor who will </v>
<v Speaker 1>vouch for something that's happening </v>

112
00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:36.511
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You almost wonder if there shouldn't be </v>

113
00:05:36.511 --> 00:05:38.071
<v Speaker 1>some kind of regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's some kind of abuse of their </v>

114
00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:39.160
<v Speaker 1>position in society or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you,</v>

115
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.600
<v Speaker 1>it's abusive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here's one of the more insidious </v>

116
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.600
<v Speaker 1>things about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real raw,</v>

117
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>real problem is there are things out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that can benefit you,</v>

118
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:50.650
<v Speaker 1>but the only way to find out is to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that have been backed by science,</v>

119
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 1>double blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>placebo controlled tests,</v>

120
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.090
<v Speaker 1>things that have been done where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know for sure and getting back to on it,</v>

121
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff that we sell is stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

122
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a history of human use,</v>

123
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:06.791
<v Speaker 1>it goes back a long time and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>research pages on every one of the </v>

124
00:06:06.791 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 1>supplements and supplements are just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of what we sell it on it,</v>

125
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.550
<v Speaker 1>but I think that supplements can give </v>
<v Speaker 1>you things that you're just not going to</v>

126
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:18.551
<v Speaker 1>get from your diet when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain nootropics and things along </v>

127
00:06:18.551 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 1>those lines.</v>

128
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.830
<v Speaker 1>The amount of food that you would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat to get the same nutrients that </v>

129
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.950
<v Speaker 1>you would get from four Alpha brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>pills.</v>

130
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.760
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking substantial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to eat like bowls of Moss and</v>

131
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>you gotta keep that shit fresh and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be able to take it on a plane.</v>

132
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.630
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of issues with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

133
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.730
<v Speaker 1>also I think that when we isolate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>locate various components of food that </v>

134
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>are beneficial for people like that is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific thing.</v>

135
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Like there's this idea of anti-science </v>
<v Speaker 1>in connection to nutrients and vitamins </v>

136
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.470
<v Speaker 1>and nothing could be crazier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

137
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 1>the issue is that some of them are being</v>
<v Speaker 1>sold without this science and that some </v>

138
00:06:56.331 --> 00:07:01.331
<v Speaker 1>of them are just bullshit and we add on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it are very committed to making sure </v>

139
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 1>anything we sell has some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit.</v>

140
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:11.021
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely provable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go to Alpha brain and read the </v>

141
00:07:11.021 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Speaker 1>research page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've conducted our own studies.</v>

142
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:17.590
<v Speaker 1>We conducted our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in the middle of the second one </v>

143
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:17.590
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We conducted one a,</v>

144
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.630
<v Speaker 1>a double blind placebo controlled study </v>
<v Speaker 1>that showed benefit and memory,</v>

145
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.660
<v Speaker 1>showed a couple statistically measurable</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers and you could see those.</v>

146
00:07:27.051 --> 00:07:32.051
<v Speaker 1>We have it all listed and we also have </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the data that is currently </v>

147
00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:36.101
<v Speaker 1>available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the studies that have been on been </v>

148
00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:38.111
<v Speaker 1>done on the individual ingredients,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very important to point out </v>

149
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:39.880
<v Speaker 1>before we sell anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we do it,</v>

150
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 1>we make sure that there's data on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual ingredients first.</v>

151
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.520
<v Speaker 1>The idea behind things like Alpha brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>are that you can combine various </v>

152
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.960
<v Speaker 1>nutrients and use them in a synergistic </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion,</v>

153
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.570
<v Speaker 1>but sound smart when I say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm actually really dumb,</v>

154
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.930
<v Speaker 1>so don't listen to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go to [inaudible] dot com and read all </v>

155
00:07:58.930 --> 00:07:58.930
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>

156
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.640
<v Speaker 1>we sell the very best strength and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning equipment that you could </v>

157
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:03.640
<v Speaker 1>buy.</v>

158
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.480
<v Speaker 1>I like kettlebells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan of them because I believe</v>

159
00:08:05.481 --> 00:08:10.481
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're swinging things and using </v>

160
00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:11.240
<v Speaker 1>momentum and using your whole body as </v>
<v Speaker 1>one unit,</v>

161
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.780
<v Speaker 1>it mimics actions that you would have in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real world.</v>

162
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Like even just like moving furniture or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

163
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Like there's Kettlebell exercises that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would make you better at picking up shit</v>

164
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 1>and moving around your houses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>practicals that kettlebell swings.</v>

165
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're doing pass throughs in </v>

166
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.531
<v Speaker 1>between your legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're doing figure eights in </v>

167
00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:34.421
<v Speaker 1>between your legs with kettlebells when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing cleans and presses and </v>

168
00:08:34.421 --> 00:08:37.571
<v Speaker 1>cleans and jerks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those different exercises to </v>

169
00:08:37.571 --> 00:08:37.571
<v Speaker 1>strengthen your whole body as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual unit.</v>

170
00:08:37.571 --> 00:08:41.420
<v Speaker 1>And when it comes to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the term human optimization,</v>

171
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean that it embodies it in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion,</v>

172
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:48.760
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm interested in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the human body should be like a </v>

173
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.421
<v Speaker 1>race car and I think that if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>race car and for whatever reason you </v>

174
00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:55.991
<v Speaker 1>don't want to put race fuel in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for whatever reason you don't want </v>

175
00:08:55.991 --> 00:08:58.571
<v Speaker 1>to give it a 500 horsepower engine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason you want to give it </v>

176
00:08:58.571 --> 00:08:59.310
<v Speaker 1>a big fat tires that grip the road.</v>

177
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.640
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck face your race car is going to </v>

178
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:04.640
<v Speaker 1>suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to suck.</v>

179
00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.781
<v Speaker 1>It's just not gonna work as well as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>race car that is designed and </v>

180
00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:13.611
<v Speaker 1>constructed by a guy who took his body </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a Gal who took their body and did the</v>

181
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:16.470
<v Speaker 1>best thing they could do for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drank a lot of water.</v>

182
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:21.471
<v Speaker 1>Eight fresh leafy green vegetables takes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of high quality protein and </v>

183
00:09:21.471 --> 00:09:23.520
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make that mother fucker work.</v>

184
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.700
<v Speaker 1>You got to exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most critical parts of </v>

185
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.460
<v Speaker 1>life because if your body doesn't think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it has to do anything,</v>

186
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.670
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just starts to go soft and get </v>

187
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.161
<v Speaker 1>useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your body doesn't think that it has </v>

188
00:09:37.161 --> 00:09:37.161
<v Speaker 1>to work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

189
00:09:37.161 --> 00:09:37.161
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to use any resources.</v>

190
00:09:37.161 --> 00:09:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staying healthy and fit.</v>

191
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Let's just fucking turn into a ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>mush.</v>

<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

193
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.160
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

<v Speaker 1>supplements.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to return the pills.</v>

198
00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

199
00:09:58.081 --> 00:09:59.850

<v Speaker 1>you are selling snake oil.</v>

203
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 1>Go read the research behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why we sell it.</v>

204
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:13.530
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is we are trying to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>people an edge and edge in life and edge</v>

205
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:16.110

<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

210
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.840

230
00:11:31.311 --> 00:11:31.890
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

231
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:33.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

232
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:38.850
<v Speaker 2>I figured coming straight from Google io</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it would make a lot of sense to </v>

233
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:39.480
<v Speaker 2>bring some of this stuff inside would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been ashamed to.</v>

234
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.900
<v Speaker 2>What exactly is Google io?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

235
00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:46.901
<v Speaker 2>it's their developers conference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's focused on bringing together </v>

236
00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:51.521
<v Speaker 2>people that are making apps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of Google centric type of </v>

237
00:11:51.521 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 2>applications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also turned a consumer facing</v>

238
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.430
<v Speaker 3>conference because a lot of people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>paying attention at that time.</v>

239
00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 3>I think they had a million concurrent </v>
<v Speaker 3>streamers of the actual event.</v>

240
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:05.140
<v Speaker 3>So a million,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a million worldwide.</v>

241
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.490
<v Speaker 3>So current,</v>
<v Speaker 3>concurrent,</v>

242
00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:08.470
<v Speaker 3>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>

243
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:11.680
<v Speaker 3>It sounded like too much to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not going to question google.</v>

244
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 3>Well that's a good television show on </v>
<v Speaker 3>HBO,</v>

245
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it?</v>

246
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean like if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

247
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.180
<v Speaker 3>what does game?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they do.</v>

248
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they do a concurrent.</v>

249
00:12:22.001 --> 00:12:23.860
<v Speaker 3>I guess it would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine.</v>

250
00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:26.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of his dvr this day and age,</v>

251
00:12:26.131 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 3>that's what I was wondering else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's Dvr,</v>

252
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.600
<v Speaker 3>so it has to be an event where you sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of feel like you need to capture your </v>

253
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.330
<v Speaker 3>catchy and live or else you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>miss something.</v>

254
00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:35.440
<v Speaker 3>Whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

255
00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:37.390
<v Speaker 3>you could watch the Google io conference</v>
<v Speaker 3>after,</v>

256
00:12:37.391 --> 00:12:42.391
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people paying a lot of </v>

257
00:12:42.391 --> 00:12:42.391
<v Speaker 3>attention to the things they were doing.</v>

258
00:12:42.391 --> 00:12:43.270
<v Speaker 3>What do those Mac world conferences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the big ones,</v>

259
00:12:43.271 --> 00:12:43.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do those.</v>

260
00:12:43.991 --> 00:12:45.940
<v Speaker 3>Not Anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not anymore.</v>

261
00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:49.450
<v Speaker 3>A WWDC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apple holds its own conferences now,</v>

262
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:54.510
<v Speaker 3>so Mac world was actually like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>independent body and they just used it </v>

263
00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.280
<v Speaker 3>as a vehicle to introduce new products.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like a convention for Mac,</v>

264
00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.340
<v Speaker 3>apple and apple related stuff and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to opt out of all third party </v>

265
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.050
<v Speaker 3>conventions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not at ces in any form.</v>

266
00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:06.880
<v Speaker 3>Apples,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not apple.</v>

267
00:13:06.881 --> 00:13:09.790
<v Speaker 3>They want to control the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

268
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:14.791
<v Speaker 3>And so many of them happened on their </v>
<v Speaker 3>campus and then some happened in </v>

269
00:13:14.791 --> 00:13:18.121
<v Speaker 3>downtown San Francisco like Google Io.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big point of debate and </v>

270
00:13:18.251 --> 00:13:19.150
<v Speaker 3>dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

271
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 3>With apple?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

272
00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:21.850
<v Speaker 3>The controlled environment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

273
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.890
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

274
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

275
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.110
<v Speaker 3>there's good sides and bad sides to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of approach.</v>

276
00:13:29.111 --> 00:13:34.111
<v Speaker 3>Obviously controlling the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>software and hardware experience means </v>

277
00:13:34.111 --> 00:13:36.280
<v Speaker 3>that you're going to get a product that </v>
<v Speaker 3>generally is fairly polished,</v>

278
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:41.340
<v Speaker 3>but from an innovation standpoint it </v>
<v Speaker 3>means you're sort of cutting off your </v>

279
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:45.930
<v Speaker 3>limbs in a sense that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing people into that development </v>

280
00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:49.351
<v Speaker 3>circle that might have otherwise been </v>
<v Speaker 3>there because it is sort of a walled </v>

281
00:13:49.351 --> 00:13:49.351
<v Speaker 3>garden effect.</v>

282
00:13:49.351 --> 00:13:50.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that fascinating?</v>

283
00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:54.160
<v Speaker 3>I always remember the back in the day </v>
<v Speaker 3>when the clones were legal,</v>

284
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:55.230
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

285
00:13:55.240 --> 00:14:00.240
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apple clones be able to go and there </v>

286
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.451
<v Speaker 3>were stores that would construct you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>an apple computer like semi recently </v>

287
00:14:03.451 --> 00:14:05.220
<v Speaker 3>macintosh's they were called not even </v>
<v Speaker 3>semi recently,</v>

288
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:08.710
<v Speaker 3>a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Used to be actual retail distributors to</v>

289
00:14:08.711 --> 00:14:12.910
<v Speaker 3>sell Mac products.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way more powerful than apple was making.</v>

290
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.810
<v Speaker 3>It would sell them with five fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard drives and souped up.</v>

291
00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:21.730
<v Speaker 3>I built a couple other way back and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>apple just put the Kibosh on that.</v>

292
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:22.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

293
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:25.300
<v Speaker 3>I can almost remember the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>big company.</v>

294
00:14:25.301 --> 00:14:28.740
<v Speaker 3>It was like either cylon or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

295
00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.930
<v Speaker 3>I think it was siloed and there is some </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of court case and they had to stay.</v>

296
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you want to go up against </v>
<v Speaker 3>apple in court.</v>

297
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.990
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>back then apple was way weaker but still</v>

298
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.380
<v Speaker 3>formidable till scariest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they.</v>

299
00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.560
<v Speaker 3>So they now are the one computer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is if you look at it </v>

300
00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.370
<v Speaker 3>from the product point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

301
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.500
<v Speaker 3>They make the best shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just do.</v>

302
00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:53.210
<v Speaker 3>They make the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make the best desktops.</v>

303
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.340
<v Speaker 3>They make the shit that crashes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>least.</v>

304
00:14:55.341 --> 00:15:00.341
<v Speaker 3>They make an operating system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the most I would say they make </v>

305
00:15:00.341 --> 00:15:00.770
<v Speaker 3>the best shit for the most people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the most people.</v>

306
00:15:00.771 --> 00:15:05.771
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think that if you really want </v>

307
00:15:05.771 --> 00:15:05.870
<v Speaker 3>to get in there and tinker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're like a heavy duty power user,</v>

308
00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.860
<v Speaker 3>a lot of this like you look at this Mac </v>
<v Speaker 3>book air or your Mac book pro,</v>

309
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:15.250
<v Speaker 3>there's so much of it that's embedded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It requires the entire package top or </v>

310
00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:19.571
<v Speaker 3>you want to go in there and put more ram</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it or something or a swap out a hard </v>

311
00:15:19.571 --> 00:15:19.571
<v Speaker 3>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not gonna happen.</v>

312
00:15:19.571 --> 00:15:22.880
<v Speaker 3>You got to bring it somewhere and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>geniuses at the apple geniuses.</v>

313
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Tentious you look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love apple,</v>

314
00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:31.541
<v Speaker 3>but how fucking dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel about the apple store </v>

315
00:15:31.541 --> 00:15:31.550
<v Speaker 3>experience in general?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy it.</v>

316
00:15:31.551 --> 00:15:32.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

317
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.010
<v Speaker 3>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's um,</v>

318
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.810
<v Speaker 3>it's a very busy place when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling computers.</v>

319
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:41.820
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember when windows tried to have a </v>

320
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:41.820
<v Speaker 3>windows store and they're still trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>coyote hunting.</v>

321
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:46.760
<v Speaker 3>They're fun coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know nobody in those fucking things.</v>

322
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.420
<v Speaker 3>I took a picture of an empty one before </v>
<v Speaker 3>and tweeted it out and everybody got it.</v>

323
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:54.980
<v Speaker 3>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not.</v>

324
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.950
<v Speaker 3>They're not known for selling hardware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

325
00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.850
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were a software company.</v>

326
00:15:58.851 --> 00:16:01.460
<v Speaker 3>You see a Microsoft sign on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a mall.</v>

327
00:16:01.461 --> 00:16:02.020
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

328
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.940
<v Speaker 3>What am I buying here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>As an ignorant person,</v>

329
00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm ignorant to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as development development of a </v>

330
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:10.340
<v Speaker 3>product,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a laptop,</v>

331
00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:15.341
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty ignorant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know too much other than the </v>

332
00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:15.341
<v Speaker 3>things I've vaguely paid attention to </v>
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>

333
00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:20.120
<v Speaker 3>What is stopping someone from making </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a super high end windows laptop </v>

334
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.820
<v Speaker 3>that looks like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that feels there are so many that look </v>

335
00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:26.750
<v Speaker 3>and feel like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are this high quality and they give</v>

336
00:16:26.751 --> 00:16:28.010
<v Speaker 3>you the same experience?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

337
00:16:28.011 --> 00:16:33.011
<v Speaker 3>because you're running windows is </v>
<v Speaker 3>windows so much worse.</v>

338
00:16:33.051 --> 00:16:38.051
<v Speaker 3>They have so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Drop the ball out of the drought but </v>

339
00:16:38.051 --> 00:16:39.790
<v Speaker 3>pretty bad after the windows experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>of 19 whatever.</v>

340
00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.070
<v Speaker 3>Like they dropped the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they dropped it and then they shit on it</v>

341
00:16:43.071 --> 00:16:45.410
<v Speaker 3>and then they fell on it and then they </v>
<v Speaker 3>broke their hip.</v>

342
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:50.470
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't want to speak for </v>

343
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:51.971
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't recall any experience with </v>

344
00:16:51.971 --> 00:16:54.371
<v Speaker 3>windows where I cracked open a laptop </v>
<v Speaker 3>lid and felt that kind of experience </v>

345
00:16:54.981 --> 00:16:59.981
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even when x p was the thing or even </v>

346
00:16:59.981 --> 00:17:00.800
<v Speaker 3>before that 95 or however far back you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to go,</v>

347
00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:02.840
<v Speaker 3>you didn't get that same pleasure.</v>

348
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:07.840
<v Speaker 3>You get out of booting up an apple </v>
<v Speaker 3>product and getting into the eos and </v>

349
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.260
<v Speaker 3>seeing the cohesion of the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Windows,</v>

350
00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:14.261
<v Speaker 3>even in the old days was sort of like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary evil windows was the way to </v>

351
00:17:14.261 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 3>get to the shit you actually liked </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you wanted to download a game or</v>

352
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:19.130
<v Speaker 3>a web browser or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on its own it was.</v>

353
00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.560
<v Speaker 3>It's always been utilitarian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always been ugly.</v>

354
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always end with the dudes who ran nt </v>

355
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:26.830
<v Speaker 3>windows nt guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a really new thing.</v>

356
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:27.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

357
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.100
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

358
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.400
<v Speaker 3>He's running into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

359
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:34.420
<v Speaker 3>and there's a bunch of shit you couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>get like drivers for certain video </v>

360
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.050
<v Speaker 3>cards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you wanted to play games,</v>

361
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:41.080
<v Speaker 3>if you rent and ti,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be real issues for people do that </v>

362
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:41.240
<v Speaker 3>now with Linux.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of the counterculture.</v>

363
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:42.590
<v Speaker 3>OSTP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

364
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:46.470
<v Speaker 3>like off the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Opensource savages.</v>

365
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ibm actually originally that and now I </v>

366
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.350
<v Speaker 3>don't know who it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just open source.</v>

367
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:57.330
<v Speaker 4>If it's in anyone's hands now I do think</v>
<v Speaker 4>apple is the best of making an operating</v>

368
00:17:57.331 --> 00:17:59.850
<v Speaker 4>system slowly die,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like have a,</v>

369
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.880
<v Speaker 4>like a cancer instead of just </v>
<v Speaker 4>immediately like I'm going through an </v>

370
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.580
<v Speaker 4>experience right now where my Imac is </v>
<v Speaker 4>just dying.</v>

371
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:11.640
<v Speaker 4>It's the operating time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read it a scratch,</v>

372
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.650
<v Speaker 4>I put new memory in it and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

373
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.320
<v Speaker 4>The operating systems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just saying like this model,</v>

374
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.060
<v Speaker 4>you need to replace it soon.</v>

375
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.730
<v Speaker 3>This is the Brian redband conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 3>theory,</v>

376
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.390
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to operating systems</v>

377
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.260
<v Speaker 4>with iphones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone knows you.</v>

378
00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:28.010
<v Speaker 4>You have an iphone four and you get the </v>
<v Speaker 4>new operating system.</v>

379
00:18:28.011 --> 00:18:30.280
<v Speaker 4>We've got all the new updates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's going to be way slower.</v>

380
00:18:30.281 --> 00:18:31.720
<v Speaker 4>Even some programs might not work.</v>

381
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.420
<v Speaker 3>It's not always the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is.</v>

382
00:18:33.421 --> 00:18:38.421
<v Speaker 3>That does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there are sometimes things that </v>

383
00:18:38.421 --> 00:18:41.751
<v Speaker 3>happen within an eos that require more </v>
<v Speaker 3>hardware to be able to perform at the </v>

384
00:18:41.751 --> 00:18:46.701
<v Speaker 3>same level of non Brian's worlds goddamn</v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy to trying to get people to </v>

385
00:18:46.701 --> 00:18:47.910
<v Speaker 3>buy these new fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

386
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:50.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you want to get a Mac pro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go for it.</v>

387
00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:51.600
<v Speaker 3>Like there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're beautiful things,</v>

388
00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.980
<v Speaker 3>but it seems like with this or with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Samsung galaxy note three or whatever,</v>

389
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:59.880
<v Speaker 3>when new shit gets made new </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibilities,</v>

390
00:18:59.881 --> 00:19:01.470
<v Speaker 3>you're going to need more processing </v>
<v Speaker 3>power.</v>

391
00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:03.870
<v Speaker 3>You're going to get an apps require </v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

392
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.840
<v Speaker 3>The new videos that they're taking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new photographs,</v>

393
00:19:06.841 --> 00:19:09.060
<v Speaker 3>we take Bursa photographs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

394
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:10.560
<v Speaker 3>there's got to be some processing going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

395
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:13.020
<v Speaker 3>Definitely going to need a faster ship </v>
<v Speaker 3>rig.</v>

396
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.810
<v Speaker 3>That's just the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt that the.</v>

397
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Especially on the apple products,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in general there's this.</v>

398
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:24.470
<v Speaker 3>There's this structure built in where </v>
<v Speaker 3>the expectation is to upgrade your </v>

399
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.600
<v Speaker 3>device every time that contract is up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

400
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:30.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's no option if you want </v>

401
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:30.020
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're in the game,</v>

402
00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.830
<v Speaker 3>if you're in this loving electronics </v>
<v Speaker 3>that everyone in this room's,</v>

403
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.280
<v Speaker 3>then we're all fucking dork and hammers </v>
<v Speaker 3>when it comes.</v>

404
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.810
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New Electronics.</v>

405
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.010
<v Speaker 3>When you're in that game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to keep up.</v>

406
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.240
<v Speaker 3>If you do not keep up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you try to run an iphone three on the</v>

407
00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:47.241
<v Speaker 3>newest iphone software,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be clunky because the </v>

408
00:19:47.241 --> 00:19:49.240
<v Speaker 3>iphone three didn't have near the </v>
<v Speaker 3>capabilities and these new applications.</v>

409
00:19:49.241 --> 00:19:51.600
<v Speaker 3>Each new video that you can take the </v>
<v Speaker 3>photos,</v>

410
00:19:51.601 --> 00:19:54.910
<v Speaker 3>you can take the new weird things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can measure your heartbeat with your</v>

411
00:19:54.911 --> 00:19:56.730
<v Speaker 3>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with your camera lens,</v>

412
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.380
<v Speaker 3>with this watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can do with your watch,</v>

413
00:19:58.381 --> 00:20:00.000
<v Speaker 3>but you didn't do it with your iphone.</v>

414
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Can do it or an android phone can do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>just by holding your finger over the </v>

415
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.020
<v Speaker 3>camera lens and it measured.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie showed it to me.</v>

416
00:20:07.021 --> 00:20:08.880
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was written thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would work.</v>

417
00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:12.360
<v Speaker 3>I at work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe it's a super active.</v>

418
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.580
<v Speaker 3>I know I did it with a regular heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>monitor.</v>

419
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:19.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did it with a chest heart monitor and </v>

420
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:19.670
<v Speaker 3>I did it without at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dead on.</v>

421
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:20.310
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dead on.</v>

422
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.800
<v Speaker 3>I have a new watch though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That does it on your wrist.</v>

423
00:20:22.801 --> 00:20:27.801
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to wear a chest strap </v>

424
00:20:27.801 --> 00:20:29.691
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got the newest watch that we're in </v>

425
00:20:29.691 --> 00:20:29.691
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see it on the bottom.</v>

426
00:20:29.691 --> 00:20:34.671
<v Speaker 3>There is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the heart monitor on the bottom </v>

427
00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:34.671
<v Speaker 3>was watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

428
00:20:34.671 --> 00:20:36.730
<v Speaker 3>that's so pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

429
00:20:36.731 --> 00:20:38.310
<v Speaker 3>so pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How'd you make it green?</v>

430
00:20:38.311 --> 00:20:39.840
<v Speaker 3>It was green for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

431
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.960
<v Speaker 3>it might've been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might've gone into sleep mode or </v>

432
00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:44.960
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the model that watch?</v>

433
00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 3>So that's the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gear live they're</v>

434
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.600
<v Speaker 5>calling it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is kind of bizarre.</v>

435
00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:51.610
<v Speaker 5>They tried to get me into this at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>verizon store.</v>

436
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:52.950
<v Speaker 5>I told him to go fuck themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

437
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
<v Speaker 5>they probably try to get you into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>old version of it because this isn't </v>

438
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.290
<v Speaker 5>even on the market yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you devil you're one of those guys?</v>

439
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll look at that color.</v>

440
00:21:00.671 --> 00:21:05.200
<v Speaker 5>I made it to go green.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>

441
00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:07.840
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the difference here between the previous</v>

442
00:21:07.841 --> 00:21:12.841
<v Speaker 5>Samsung watches and this one is this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>the first to be running the open </v>

443
00:21:12.841 --> 00:21:15.130
<v Speaker 5>platform that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that Google has created.</v>

444
00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:20.160
<v Speaker 5>So not a modified version of software.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's running something called android </v>

445
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.110
<v Speaker 5>wear.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what Google is hoping to do to do on</v>

446
00:21:23.111 --> 00:21:26.350
<v Speaker 5>your wrist is essentially replicate what</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've done on the phone.</v>

447
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:28.510
<v Speaker 5>And if you look into it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the risk thing.</v>

448
00:21:28.511 --> 00:21:30.730
<v Speaker 5>That thing in there is the monitor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

449
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:36.120
<v Speaker 5>So it's optical.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's actually going to look under the </v>

450
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.270
<v Speaker 5>surface of your skin and it has like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>class on the back that locks into place.</v>

451
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.130
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the,</v>

452
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:45.200
<v Speaker 5>the beauty of this going this direction </v>
<v Speaker 5>with it is if you can build a platform </v>

453
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.750
<v Speaker 5>instead of a one off device,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then uh,</v>

454
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:52.770
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the likelihood that a developer will </v>

455
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.070
<v Speaker 5>jump into it and build something really </v>
<v Speaker 5>cool that you never foresaw happening is</v>

456
00:21:54.071 --> 00:21:57.490
<v Speaker 5>that much higher because of the mass </v>
<v Speaker 5>market effect.</v>

457
00:21:57.491 --> 00:21:59.560
<v Speaker 5>If everyone's running the same software </v>
<v Speaker 5>on their wrist,</v>

458
00:21:59.561 --> 00:22:01.770
<v Speaker 5>it's better for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

459
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.280
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's this kind of love hate </v>

460
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.731
<v Speaker 5>relationship between Samsung and Google </v>
<v Speaker 5>over this because for the longest time </v>

461
00:22:08.731 --> 00:22:13.201
<v Speaker 5>Samsung has been trying to diminish its </v>
<v Speaker 5>a reliance on Google as a,</v>

462
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:18.770
<v Speaker 5>as a whole for their brand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so essential for them to sell </v>

463
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.991
<v Speaker 5>products.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so they've been moving into some </v>

464
00:22:21.991 --> 00:22:22.270
<v Speaker 5>different operating systems now that are</v>
<v Speaker 5>not very good.</v>

465
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.540
<v Speaker 5>But independent of Google.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

466
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:25.930
<v Speaker 5>This is awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

467
00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

468
00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.140
<v Speaker 5>So I can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you some of what he does.</v>

469
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:29.650
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

470
00:22:29.651 --> 00:22:34.651
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not really that much new </v>

471
00:22:34.651 --> 00:22:36.421
<v Speaker 5>comparative to the old smartwatches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Essentially you're gonna get your </v>

472
00:22:36.421 --> 00:22:37.420
<v Speaker 5>notifications here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has a microphone on it so that,</v>

473
00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can input a voice commands,</v>

474
00:22:39.911 --> 00:22:41.770
<v Speaker 5>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So if you,</v>

475
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.050
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to text somebody back,</v>

476
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.200
<v Speaker 5>you can catch the notification here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>respond to the text right on your wrist </v>

477
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.590
<v Speaker 5>and leave your phone in your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A,</v>

478
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:55.830
<v Speaker 5>they were saying on stage that they </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe 70 percent of our interaction </v>

479
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.510
<v Speaker 5>with our device could be curbed by </v>
<v Speaker 5>having one of these on your wrists.</v>

480
00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.930
<v Speaker 5>So essentially most of the day your </v>
<v Speaker 5>phone could remain in your pocket.</v>

481
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:06.070
<v Speaker 5>But I was talking earlier with Brian </v>
<v Speaker 5>about how really the goal here,</v>

482
00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:08.260
<v Speaker 5>the end game is preemptive computing.</v>

483
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.260
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

484
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:14.510
<v Speaker 5>the idea that this thing will know what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to do before you know that you </v>

485
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.930
<v Speaker 5>want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

486
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.810
<v Speaker 5>and that's what Google now has been </v>
<v Speaker 5>pushing,</v>

487
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.170
<v Speaker 5>has been pushing in that direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So your flight lands and it can,</v>

488
00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.930
<v Speaker 5>it can estimate how long it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>take you to get home.</v>

489
00:23:22.931 --> 00:23:25.540
<v Speaker 5>Or the proximity sensor says that you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the airport,</v>

490
00:23:25.541 --> 00:23:30.541
<v Speaker 5>so it looks at your travel itinerary and</v>
<v Speaker 5>brings up your boarding pass right on </v>

491
00:23:30.541 --> 00:23:33.991
<v Speaker 5>your wrist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So those kinds of things are what make </v>

492
00:23:33.991 --> 00:23:37.740
<v Speaker 5>wearing something on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on your exterior more interesting where </v>

493
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:38.500
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a buzzing in your pocket is maybe not as</v>

494
00:23:38.501 --> 00:23:40.300
<v Speaker 5>effective as the information you can get</v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

495
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.630
<v Speaker 5>Like so travel distance and things along</v>
<v Speaker 5>those lines,</v>

496
00:23:43.631 --> 00:23:46.040
<v Speaker 5>things that updates those updates that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you get on</v>

497
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.650
<v Speaker 4>your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your warnings.</v>

498
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.990
<v Speaker 4>So things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

499
00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:55.991
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that we can necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagined all the potential uses for </v>

500
00:23:55.991 --> 00:23:58.991
<v Speaker 4>preemptive computing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean essentially much like the nest </v>

501
00:23:58.991 --> 00:24:02.321
<v Speaker 4>Thermostat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you've heard of that </v>

502
00:24:02.321 --> 00:24:03.731
<v Speaker 4>before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a really fancy thermostats you put </v>

503
00:24:03.731 --> 00:24:04.250
<v Speaker 4>in your house and it's alert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a learning thermostat and they just</v>

504
00:24:04.251 --> 00:24:06.530
<v Speaker 4>took over the marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They recently got acquired by Google,</v>

505
00:24:06.531 --> 00:24:07.520
<v Speaker 4>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

506
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.060
<v Speaker 4>and one of their designers was one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the original guys who worked on Ipod.</v>

507
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.150
<v Speaker 4>So really there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a cool story there.</v>

508
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:15.150
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

509
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.060
<v Speaker 4>anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they acquired nest.</v>

510
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:21.170
<v Speaker 4>Nest product is a learning thermostat </v>
<v Speaker 4>that never needs to be programmed.</v>

511
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.830
<v Speaker 4>The programming is just you using it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you come,</v>

512
00:24:24.831 --> 00:24:29.831
<v Speaker 4>it's Wifi connected,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you come home and you adjust it and you </v>

513
00:24:29.831 --> 00:24:32.240
<v Speaker 4>don't realize there's patterns in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior that at 3:00</v>

514
00:24:32.241 --> 00:24:37.241
<v Speaker 4>you always like it to be a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>temperature and at six it's different </v>

515
00:24:37.241 --> 00:24:39.050
<v Speaker 4>and eventually it will dry out in </v>
<v Speaker 4>algorithm to deal with your behavior,</v>

516
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:42.680
<v Speaker 4>at which point you no longer need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever worry about it or touch it.</v>

517
00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.400
<v Speaker 4>The goal of the product is to require </v>
<v Speaker 4>less and less interaction from you.</v>

518
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:51.490
<v Speaker 4>The more you use it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's weird about nest is that they </v>

519
00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:52.220
<v Speaker 4>also have these new products where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

520
00:24:52.221 --> 00:24:54.260
<v Speaker 4>they're now taking over washer and </v>
<v Speaker 4>dryers.</v>

521
00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:59.290
<v Speaker 4>They're getting to the point where it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be like that old flintstones </v>

522
00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:00.830
<v Speaker 4>where they control their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the central computer of your house.</v>

523
00:25:00.831 --> 00:25:02.180
<v Speaker 4>And there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hello computer,</v>

524
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.210
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what they are.</v>

525
00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:06.580
<v Speaker 4>And they also have these uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

526
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:10.040
<v Speaker 4>smoke detectors that also do carbon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>carbon monoxide and stuff like that.</v>

527
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.990
<v Speaker 4>So they could even turn off and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

528
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.310
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turn on the oven,</v>

529
00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:19.590
<v Speaker 4>gas this guy and kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Google is going to be able to murder </v>

530
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:21.851
<v Speaker 4>us in her house and warn you if </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's breaking into your house </v>

531
00:25:21.851 --> 00:25:21.851
<v Speaker 4>trying to murder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

532
00:25:21.851 --> 00:25:22.600
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they just acquired drop camp,</v>

533
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:27.710
<v Speaker 4>which is a jack was preaching about </v>
<v Speaker 4>forever because the drop cam is one of </v>

534
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:29.240
<v Speaker 4>the greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think inventions in a long time.</v>

535
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.750
<v Speaker 4>It's these little cameras that film </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing hd,</v>

536
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:37.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that you could put all over your </v>

537
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:37.950
<v Speaker 4>house that connect to your Wifi and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get a text like,</v>

538
00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:38.780
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody is walking through my house.</v>

539
00:25:38.781 --> 00:25:42.140
<v Speaker 4>You're sitting there watching full hd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's recording in the cloud for you.</v>

540
00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.300
<v Speaker 4>Recording our stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

541
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.440
<v Speaker 4>And it could also learn certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

542
00:25:45.441 --> 00:25:47.480
<v Speaker 4>just watch this part of the house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

543
00:25:47.481 --> 00:25:52.481
<v Speaker 4>if it's me walking around because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing detections of what kind of object </v>

544
00:25:52.481 --> 00:25:56.381
<v Speaker 4>motions it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you shut all that off cover with tee </v>

545
00:25:56.381 --> 00:25:58.520
<v Speaker 4>shirts when he fucked you put socks over</v>
<v Speaker 4>them when I remember.</v>

546
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:02.210
<v Speaker 4>And then of course that he needs that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to have that in the cloud.</v>

547
00:26:02.211 --> 00:26:02.480
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

548
00:26:02.481 --> 00:26:03.230
<v Speaker 4>I need that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

549
00:26:03.231 --> 00:26:04.940
<v Speaker 4>I need that in the clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can get hacked.</v>

550
00:26:04.941 --> 00:26:06.680
<v Speaker 4>But I also need,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how about as proof,</v>

551
00:26:06.681 --> 00:26:11.681
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that video we were talking about </v>

552
00:26:11.681 --> 00:26:11.681
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the,</v>

553
00:26:11.681 --> 00:26:15.010
<v Speaker 4>that a guy that was doing the drone over</v>
<v Speaker 4>the beach and that woman attacked,</v>

554
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:17.630
<v Speaker 4>attacked him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he had recorded.</v>

555
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.850
<v Speaker 4>If it wasn't for that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his little recording there,</v>

556
00:26:19.910 --> 00:26:22.130
<v Speaker 4>what would have happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She said that he attacked her,</v>

557
00:26:22.131 --> 00:26:22.640
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

558
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.570
<v Speaker 4>There was beating the shit out of 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what if you meet a girl at a bar,</v>

559
00:26:26.571 --> 00:26:28.880
<v Speaker 4>you're both drunk and you go back to </v>
<v Speaker 4>your living room.</v>

560
00:26:28.881 --> 00:26:30.060
<v Speaker 4>Like that comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that judge.</v>

561
00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:34.130
<v Speaker 4>I just happened to a comic I recently </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Denver and uh,</v>

562
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 4>and he got in a whole bunch of trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you feel about that world though?</v>

563
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.860
<v Speaker 4>Everything being recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the question I was going to ask.</v>

564
00:26:39.861 --> 00:26:42.080
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be great once something </v>
<v Speaker 4>bad happens,</v>

565
00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:43.840
<v Speaker 4>when it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing's bad to happen.</v>

566
00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:44.210
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

567
00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:45.720
<v Speaker 3>don't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

568
00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:50.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Except if you do something fucked up and</v>

569
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.660
<v Speaker 3>someone gets a hold of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

570
00:26:51.661 --> 00:26:53.100
<v Speaker 3>just don't do anything fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

571
00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:54.930
<v Speaker 3>It's like that Lego movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything is awesome.</v>

572
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:59.950
<v Speaker 3>Is it really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's really that simple </v>

573
00:26:59.950 --> 00:26:59.950
<v Speaker 3>though because in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you've seen,</v>

574
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.510
<v Speaker 3>you've seen before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the effect of say for example,</v>

575
00:27:03.511 --> 00:27:06.450
<v Speaker 3>editing on the end product on a show or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

576
00:27:06.451 --> 00:27:09.060
<v Speaker 3>You can totally change context,</v>
<v Speaker 3>change narrative.</v>

577
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:14.540
<v Speaker 3>Somebody having footage of you doing any</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of behavior could potentially be </v>

578
00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:18.561
<v Speaker 3>used to harm you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we all know if you have a photoshop </v>

579
00:27:18.561 --> 00:27:18.561
<v Speaker 3>that there's wastage detective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's photoshop.</v>

580
00:27:18.561 --> 00:27:18.710
<v Speaker 3>If there's an editor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>

581
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 3>There's so much smart little algorithms </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can tell that there's one grain</v>

582
00:27:22.411 --> 00:27:27.411
<v Speaker 3>that's not supposed to be there in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>film as far as like actually altering </v>

583
00:27:27.411 --> 00:27:29.940
<v Speaker 3>the image itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not the context of the image itself.</v>

584
00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:30.810
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

585
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:35.870
<v Speaker 3>you could have someone doing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's actually not fucked up and you </v>

586
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.870
<v Speaker 3>knew the whole story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

587
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:38.940
<v Speaker 3>that's yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's an issue.</v>

588
00:27:38.941 --> 00:27:43.941
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly an issue and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly an issue because there's </v>

589
00:27:43.941 --> 00:27:43.941
<v Speaker 3>people that have that power over others.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

590
00:27:43.941 --> 00:27:45.860
<v Speaker 3>That's what the real issue with the NSA </v>
<v Speaker 3>is like,</v>

591
00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.240
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're monitoring every single person in</v>

592
00:27:48.241 --> 00:27:51.180
<v Speaker 3>the country that use,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assuming we're all criminals,</v>

593
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:56.360
<v Speaker 3>because if not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then do you pick a target like that you </v>

594
00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:56.360
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is innocent.</v>

595
00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:56.550
<v Speaker 3>Is it okay for you to monitor them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

596
00:27:56.551 --> 00:27:57.810
<v Speaker 3>it's not right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all agree.</v>

597
00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:02.960
<v Speaker 3>So the only reason why it's okay as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're looking at us all as potential </v>

598
00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.000
<v Speaker 3>criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a real issue.</v>

599
00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:08.020
<v Speaker 3>That's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely just that philosophy of </v>

600
00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.760
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that philosophy of ruling over people </v>

601
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.610
<v Speaker 3>because it's omnipotent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

602
00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:16.140
<v Speaker 3>On my way over this just reminded me of </v>
<v Speaker 3>something or before I left the hotel,</v>

603
00:28:16.141 --> 00:28:21.141
<v Speaker 3>I saw on the TV about that guy whose kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>died in the backseat of his car.</v>

604
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you've heard about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Georgia.</v>

605
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.830
<v Speaker 3>His,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

606
00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.780
<v Speaker 3>so he leave the kid in the back left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old was the kid?</v>

607
00:28:27.781 --> 00:28:30.590
<v Speaker 3>The kid was toddler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>left him in the backseat,</v>

608
00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.680
<v Speaker 3>overheated and died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And today I guess they find out the dude</v>

609
00:28:34.681 --> 00:28:37.590
<v Speaker 3>was googling hot car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>death,</v>

610
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:42.720
<v Speaker 3>backseat death prior to the event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to see how long did it on purpose.</v>

611
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.330
<v Speaker 3>That's the thought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

612
00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:50.610
<v Speaker 3>he was saying how long he could leave </v>
<v Speaker 3>his kid in there while he runs in and </v>

613
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:50.610
<v Speaker 3>gets a fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's pretty.</v>

614
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:52.220
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty fucked up on its own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

615
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:54.450
<v Speaker 3>Either one is fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He tried to kill this kid.</v>

616
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:59.480
<v Speaker 3>He killed his kid pc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the problem is stories like that </v>

617
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.190
<v Speaker 3>resonate so close to home that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

618
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.960
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Give them all the power they need.</v>

619
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.670
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

620
00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's how I feel sometimes telling</v>

621
00:29:07.601 --> 00:29:08.220
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull this up,</v>

622
00:29:08.221 --> 00:29:09.220
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to see that guy's.</v>

623
00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:09.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

624
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.690
<v Speaker 3>you don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I feel like that when it comes</v>

625
00:29:12.691 --> 00:29:17.691
<v Speaker 3>to like location services,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want google to know where you </v>

626
00:29:17.691 --> 00:29:17.691
<v Speaker 3>are?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

627
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I got to think about where am I?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What am I doing?</v>

628
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.220
<v Speaker 3>I showed them on yesterday's podcast how</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's iphones has on default.</v>

629
00:29:26.221 --> 00:29:28.620
<v Speaker 3>Just all the locations that they sit at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

630
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.870
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very strange that that's it is.</v>

631
00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:35.940
<v Speaker 3>And you and you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really start to wonder about all of </v>

632
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.590
<v Speaker 3>this power we give to these devices over</v>
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>

633
00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to these companies that,</v>

634
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:45.020
<v Speaker 3>that we have this inherent trust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're at a point now where we rely on </v>

635
00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:48.520
<v Speaker 3>these things to a degree that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really allow for an opt out.</v>

636
00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not for me,</v>

637
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.470
<v Speaker 3>obviously now for this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

638
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.690
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not for all kinds of exercise.</v>

639
00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:59.690
<v Speaker 3>And if we knew that the police and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dea and the whatever organization that </v>

640
00:30:00.011 --> 00:30:03.430
<v Speaker 3>might be investigating you was </v>
<v Speaker 3>infallible and super ethical.</v>

641
00:30:03.431 --> 00:30:08.431
<v Speaker 3>There was no corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no issues whatsoever with the </v>

642
00:30:08.431 --> 00:30:08.920
<v Speaker 3>lying in order to close cases to go look</v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

643
00:30:08.921 --> 00:30:10.720
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we know that's true.</v>

644
00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:15.930
<v Speaker 3>We know that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know there's been a lot of </v>

645
00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.760
<v Speaker 3>prosecutors that have willingly put </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in jail because they didn't want </v>

646
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:17.760
<v Speaker 3>to admit they were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got the wrong person.</v>

647
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:22.670
<v Speaker 3>One of those stories always messed me up</v>
<v Speaker 3>when this guy gets let out of jail 25 </v>

648
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:27.451
<v Speaker 3>years later on DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like the only truth is the </v>

649
00:30:27.451 --> 00:30:27.470
<v Speaker 3>scientific truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

650
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:30.850
<v Speaker 3>it seems there's no other truth once </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in human being's hands,</v>

651
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:34.030
<v Speaker 3>it's like Google with these self driving</v>
<v Speaker 3>cars like they can.</v>

652
00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.560
<v Speaker 3>They can eliminate so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

653
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:40.420
<v Speaker 3>Almost like 90 percent are human error,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

654
00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at airplanes,</v>

655
00:30:41.891 --> 00:30:45.160
<v Speaker 3>how their safety records are insane and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the majority of that pro,</v>

656
00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.400
<v Speaker 3>we'll put a plane in the sky and let it </v>
<v Speaker 3>fly itself,</v>

657
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.890
<v Speaker 3>but we won't let a car on the road do so</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>

658
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:56.040
<v Speaker 3>The number one way that you will die </v>
<v Speaker 3>between the ages of four and 34 is in a </v>

659
00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:56.560
<v Speaker 3>vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

660
00:30:56.561 --> 00:31:01.561
<v Speaker 3>we're letting it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you say we're not going to let it </v>

661
00:31:01.561 --> 00:31:04.381
<v Speaker 3>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're letting google cars </v>

662
00:31:04.381 --> 00:31:04.381
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're driving them right now for.</v>

663
00:31:04.381 --> 00:31:05.290
<v Speaker 3>Well they're out there but they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>publicly available.</v>

664
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.580
<v Speaker 3>There will be some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

665
00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:12.760
<v Speaker 3>I mean the oil and gas companies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealerships liquidated to Tesla in New </v>

666
00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.560
<v Speaker 3>Jersey there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there'll be able to do </v>

667
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:16.560
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not long term,</v>

668
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:16.560
<v Speaker 3>not long term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they can put,</v>

669
00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:20.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorta like the marijuana thing in </v>

670
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:20.760
<v Speaker 3>Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's.</v>

671
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:20.860
<v Speaker 3>It ebbs and flows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

672
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes a little bit this way and I was </v>

673
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:25.920
<v Speaker 3>back that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be so transparent though.</v>

674
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.821
<v Speaker 3>It'd be the real issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like why would you try to avoid </v>

675
00:31:29.821 --> 00:31:30.370
<v Speaker 3>something that is easy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>convenient and unbelievably safe.</v>

676
00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:35.530
<v Speaker 3>It'll just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There'll be somebody with some kind of </v>

677
00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.130
<v Speaker 3>economic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think personal freedom issues are </v>

678
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:39.010
<v Speaker 3>going to still apply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I liked to be able to drive our.</v>

679
00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:40.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

680
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.450
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine a point at which that </v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes illegal?</v>

681
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what happened?</v>

682
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.740
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

683
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.020
<v Speaker 3>or you could have to take your car to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking race track.</v>

684
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:52.070
<v Speaker 3>You imagine if the only way you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>drive your Subaru was taking on a </v>

685
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.070
<v Speaker 3>racetrack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

686
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.780
<v Speaker 3>but if you haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you haven't relic.</v>

687
00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:57.840
<v Speaker 3>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sometimes feel like on the regular </v>

688
00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:57.840
<v Speaker 3>roads if you have a really nice car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of like,</v>

689
00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>putting a muzzle on the dog,</v>

690
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really to to get the most out of it.</v>

691
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:08.090
<v Speaker 3>A race track would be good anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is definitely true to get the most </v>

692
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:08.090
<v Speaker 3>out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can get something.</v>

693
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:08.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

694
00:32:08.561 --> 00:32:09.610
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

695
00:32:09.611 --> 00:32:12.550
<v Speaker 3>You can still get something you get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot out of it depends on where it rode.</v>

696
00:32:12.551 --> 00:32:15.420
<v Speaker 3>Take like a angel's crest forest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

697
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:16.990
<v Speaker 3>The Angeles Crest highway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

698
00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:18.610
<v Speaker 3>you've been up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

699
00:32:18.611 --> 00:32:23.611
<v Speaker 3>like out near where that gun ranges to </v>
<v Speaker 3>all these crazy winding.</v>

700
00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.750
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fun to drive.</v>

701
00:32:25.751 --> 00:32:30.751
<v Speaker 3>There is a way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just that unfortunately 98 percent </v>

702
00:32:30.751 --> 00:32:32.320
<v Speaker 3>of the way people drive sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're sitting in gridlock.</v>

703
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:37.350
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your phone should not receive or send </v>

704
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:39.961
<v Speaker 3>tax once it's in the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once it's in the car should be a thing </v>

705
00:32:39.961 --> 00:32:39.961
<v Speaker 3>where the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

706
00:32:39.961 --> 00:32:40.570
<v Speaker 3>the car recognizes</v>

707
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.810
<v Speaker 5>actually a bluetooth that your phone is </v>
<v Speaker 5>a good segue.</v>

708
00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:43.600
<v Speaker 5>No tax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

709
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:48.640
<v Speaker 5>That's a good segue because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>announcements actually at Google io was </v>

710
00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:48.800
<v Speaker 5>googling the car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which,</v>

711
00:32:48.801 --> 00:32:49.940
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>again,</v>

712
00:32:49.941 --> 00:32:54.941
<v Speaker 5>talks to all these different devices and</v>
<v Speaker 5>is essentially going to overhaul your </v>

713
00:32:54.941 --> 00:32:57.710
<v Speaker 5>car dash unit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which by the way,</v>

714
00:32:57.711 --> 00:32:59.720
<v Speaker 5>they all suck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're all terrible.</v>

715
00:32:59.721 --> 00:33:03.680
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's experienced the shitty </v>
<v Speaker 5>capacitive screens in the slow input and</v>

716
00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:08.860
<v Speaker 5>pretty much everyone agrees,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just slapping your phone in the center </v>

717
00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.831
<v Speaker 5>of the dash that's going to give you a </v>
<v Speaker 5>better experience than the three or </v>

718
00:33:11.831 --> 00:33:14.891
<v Speaker 5>$4,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>a unit that the car company installed a </v>

719
00:33:14.891 --> 00:33:18.441
<v Speaker 5>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Part of what holds them back is that </v>

720
00:33:18.441 --> 00:33:18.441
<v Speaker 5>they have to have approval so far in </v>
<v Speaker 5>advance,</v>

721
00:33:18.441 --> 00:33:22.661
<v Speaker 5>three years or four years or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>to get to get approved to go into a </v>

722
00:33:22.661 --> 00:33:23.990
<v Speaker 5>motor vehicle that they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

723
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.170
<v Speaker 5>that they're so far behind by the time </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're actually driving it,</v>

724
00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:29.060
<v Speaker 5>that you've got a crappy experience.</v>

725
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:34.060
<v Speaker 5>But the goal here for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for Google is that your phone is </v>

726
00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:34.280
<v Speaker 5>actually the brain because this is </v>
<v Speaker 5>modular,</v>

727
00:33:34.281 --> 00:33:36.380
<v Speaker 5>this changes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You upgrade this all the time.</v>

728
00:33:36.381 --> 00:33:37.970
<v Speaker 5>Your car on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not so much.</v>

729
00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:43.180
<v Speaker 5>So if this is the brain doing all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>processing and just outputting video to </v>

730
00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:43.930
<v Speaker 5>a monitor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that also happens to be touch screen.</v>

731
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.380
<v Speaker 5>You don't necessarily have to worry </v>
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>

732
00:33:45.381 --> 00:33:47.690
<v Speaker 5>So much new points of interest on Nav,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for example.</v>

733
00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:49.610
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't happen on these,</v>

734
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.640
<v Speaker 5>these locked off circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whether you have a,</v>

735
00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.730
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a vw or a Ford or whatever,</v>

736
00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.880
<v Speaker 5>each one of those experiences relies on </v>
<v Speaker 5>those companies to go input those new </v>

737
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:01.160
<v Speaker 5>pos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So a new restaurant opens,</v>

738
00:34:01.161 --> 00:34:03.710
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas in the case of this,</v>

739
00:34:03.711 --> 00:34:05.420
<v Speaker 5>it's always going to be current </v>
<v Speaker 5>information.</v>

740
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:10.930
<v Speaker 5>So the phone will sort of the car rather</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're sort of act as an app sort of.</v>

741
00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:14.690
<v Speaker 5>I would honestly think of it as more of </v>
<v Speaker 5>an as an output method.</v>

742
00:34:14.691 --> 00:34:17.600
<v Speaker 5>So like basically imagine when you plug </v>
<v Speaker 5>this in,</v>

743
00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:21.500
<v Speaker 5>when you plug this phone into a TV,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would see this,</v>

744
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.660
<v Speaker 5>let's say you say see this image up on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the screen there.</v>

745
00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.880
<v Speaker 5>So let's imagine the same thing but on </v>
<v Speaker 5>your car dash right?</v>

746
00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:28.540
<v Speaker 5>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why,</v>

747
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:31.790
<v Speaker 5>why we're all doing this anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's say phone would be an APP,</v>

748
00:34:31.791 --> 00:34:33.820
<v Speaker 5>but I'm in your car would be an APP.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

749
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.050
<v Speaker 5>Essentially your car where you'd plug </v>
<v Speaker 5>into your phone.</v>

750
00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:41.140
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those dudes who run those really large </v>

751
00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:41.140
<v Speaker 5>lenses,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they take photographs,</v>

752
00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:46.330
<v Speaker 5>they plugged it in and there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently there's software that allows </v>

753
00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:46.880
<v Speaker 5>you to use these lenses with certain </v>
<v Speaker 5>cell phones.</v>

754
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:48.260
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You haven't seen that?</v>

755
00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:50.350
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They make large lenses.</v>

756
00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:51.500
<v Speaker 5>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know about all that shit.</v>

757
00:34:51.501 --> 00:34:51.740
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

758
00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.730
<v Speaker 5>The like a physical adapter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

759
00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:59.850
<v Speaker 5>They put like your lap and I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 5>some of them have applications that go </v>

760
00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:03.821
<v Speaker 5>along.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Definitely sort of the car is sort of </v>

761
00:35:03.821 --> 00:35:03.821
<v Speaker 5>acting like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

762
00:35:03.821 --> 00:35:07.661
<v Speaker 5>an extension and there's some sort of an</v>
<v Speaker 5>application that allow your car to </v>

763
00:35:07.661 --> 00:35:09.380
<v Speaker 5>interface with your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only thing is we would be.</v>

764
00:35:09.381 --> 00:35:14.381
<v Speaker 5>You wouldn't have to do any work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Essentially it would be baked into your </v>

765
00:35:14.381 --> 00:35:15.020
<v Speaker 5>phone and if you never used it you'd </v>
<v Speaker 5>never need to worry about it,</v>

766
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:18.470
<v Speaker 5>but you would have to have a specific </v>
<v Speaker 5>operating system though because like say</v>

767
00:35:18.471 --> 00:35:20.940
<v Speaker 5>if you have a Subaru and Subaru only </v>
<v Speaker 5>handles android,</v>

768
00:35:20.941 --> 00:35:21.620
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly,</v>

769
00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:26.800
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they announced like 50 auto </v>

770
00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:26.800
<v Speaker 5>manufacturers that are on board.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That makes sense.</v>

771
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:30.530
<v Speaker 5>That's a huge pain that dick though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when it comes to switching phones,</v>

772
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:35.120
<v Speaker 5>like I like going back and this and this</v>
<v Speaker 5>is something that I wanted to talk about</v>

773
00:35:35.121 --> 00:35:40.121
<v Speaker 5>how now with more and more devices,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's becoming super important to pick </v>

774
00:35:40.501 --> 00:35:41.040
<v Speaker 5>your team.</v>

775
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're separating people.</v>

776
00:35:45.111 --> 00:35:46.550
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like both.</v>

777
00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:48.380
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love my note.</v>

778
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:50.570
<v Speaker 1>I love the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The screen is incredible.</v>

779
00:35:50.571 --> 00:35:53.240
<v Speaker 1>I love the online experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I got recently,</v>

780
00:35:53.241 --> 00:35:55.310
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to fucking IPAD air.</v>

781
00:35:55.311 --> 00:36:00.311
<v Speaker 1>The big one with a horizon connection is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I got this connection happen.</v>

782
00:36:00.621 --> 00:36:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

783
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.000
<v Speaker 1>My web browsing with a laptop or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

784
00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean my website is done with a phone </v>
<v Speaker 1>or basically over.</v>

785
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.990
<v Speaker 5>Do you know what's great about this I </v>
<v Speaker 5>suggest is when you're on the road,</v>

786
00:36:09.991 --> 00:36:12.540
<v Speaker 5>I had t and t as my wife or as my cell </v>
<v Speaker 5>phone,</v>

787
00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:17.541
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of places [inaudible] and t </v>
<v Speaker 5>sucks or vice versa and you could just </v>

788
00:36:17.541 --> 00:36:18.060
<v Speaker 5>make a hotspot using this so you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>always having the best time.</v>

789
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Could have a boy.</v>

790
00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:20.860
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's,</v>

791
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.420
<v Speaker 5>here's an interesting thing there in </v>
<v Speaker 5>that picking a,</v>

792
00:36:25.421 --> 00:36:30.421
<v Speaker 5>picking a platform,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe it won't be such an issue in the </v>

793
00:36:30.421 --> 00:36:32.550
<v Speaker 5>future anyways because I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I sort of view as much as I like apple.</v>

794
00:36:32.551 --> 00:36:35.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean I've got products here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I use the iphone is in my pocket daily.</v>

795
00:36:35.981 --> 00:36:40.981
<v Speaker 5>You've got this laptop here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have no track zero traction in </v>

796
00:36:40.981 --> 00:36:43.810
<v Speaker 5>emerging markets at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not even of interest to them.</v>

797
00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.270
<v Speaker 5>They sell here and only here,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about you,</v>

798
00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:51.330
<v Speaker 1>but I'm American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really give a fuck about some </v>

799
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:55.880
<v Speaker 1>mud hut yet except that those people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those mud huts are making killer apps </v>

800
00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:58.600
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh dammit.</v>

801
00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:03.690
<v Speaker 1>And if their first device that they get </v>
<v Speaker 1>their hands on happens to be an android </v>

802
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:03.880
<v Speaker 1>device that matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

803
00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a global circumstance.</v>

804
00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying for awhile that it's </v>

805
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:11.680
<v Speaker 1>almost like apple can't win because even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though they have really high level stuff</v>

806
00:37:11.681 --> 00:37:14.110
<v Speaker 1>and you start looking at like the moto m</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

807
00:37:14.111 --> 00:37:14.770
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

808
00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:16.690
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty God damn close to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>iphone.</v>

809
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it just had a better camera,</v>

810
00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.700
<v Speaker 1>the camera's kind of whack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

811
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:25.030
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I heard you guys talk about this before </v>

812
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:27.070
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wanted to talk about this </v>

813
00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:27.650
<v Speaker 5>specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cell or cell phone cameras.</v>

814
00:37:27.651 --> 00:37:32.651
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody in the tech world knows that </v>

815
00:37:32.651 --> 00:37:33.710
<v Speaker 5>distinct takes the best instagram </v>
<v Speaker 5>photos.</v>

816
00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:34.990
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

817
00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:40.680
<v Speaker 5>I said that specifically because it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>the number one way or the way that we </v>

818
00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:42.560
<v Speaker 5>share photos and ultimately how you </v>
<v Speaker 5>share it is the biggest part of it.</v>

819
00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:47.590
<v Speaker 5>Who cares if it looks great on your </v>
<v Speaker 5>phone when when other people have to </v>

820
00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:47.600
<v Speaker 5>have to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If it doesn't.</v>

821
00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:50.240
<v Speaker 5>So other phones came out and you guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>talked to him.</v>

822
00:37:50.241 --> 00:37:54.220
<v Speaker 5>There was one from note instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You saying this go.</v>

823
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:56.860
<v Speaker 5>I keep talking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right,</v>

824
00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.380
<v Speaker 5>so other devices came out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a Gnocchi devices,</v>

825
00:38:00.381 --> 00:38:04.640
<v Speaker 5>a 41 megapixel phone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a windows phone 40.</v>

826
00:38:04.641 --> 00:38:06.410
<v Speaker 5>What?</v>
<v Speaker 5>40 one megapixel.</v>

827
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.130
<v Speaker 5>But you see that device is not focused </v>
<v Speaker 5>on the output method.</v>

828
00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:13.250
<v Speaker 5>It's just like let's just make these </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy images that are huge.</v>

829
00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:18.370
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how the hell do I get that thing on </v>

830
00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:18.370
<v Speaker 5>instagram for the longest time windows </v>
<v Speaker 5>phone didn't even have instagram,</v>

831
00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:18.620
<v Speaker 5>but here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

832
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.880
<v Speaker 5>Instagram is a piece of software and in </v>
<v Speaker 5>order for it to work smoothly,</v>

833
00:38:22.881 --> 00:38:25.190
<v Speaker 5>it has to compress your photos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

834
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:30.430
<v Speaker 5>so the thing you're taking on your phone</v>
<v Speaker 5>just in the camera app is not the same </v>

835
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:32.330
<v Speaker 5>thing that other people end up seeing on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the other side of instagram.</v>

836
00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.530
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean,</v>

837
00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.750
<v Speaker 5>and that compression algorithm is very </v>
<v Speaker 5>sophisticated.</v>

838
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:42.900
<v Speaker 5>It has to go in there and figure out </v>
<v Speaker 5>what can I remove and what do I need to </v>

839
00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:43.180
<v Speaker 5>leave in time to make a beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 5>picture.</v>

840
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:48.540
<v Speaker 5>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're building the Ios side of </v>

841
00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:48.850
<v Speaker 5>Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of that APP,</v>

842
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:52.540
<v Speaker 5>it's very easy to build because what are</v>
<v Speaker 5>your parameters?</v>

843
00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.880
<v Speaker 5>It's the same camera every time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

844
00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:57.970
<v Speaker 5>Android,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Holy Shit.</v>

845
00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.740
<v Speaker 5>How many android phones are on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>market?</v>

846
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:04.800
<v Speaker 5>A lot of fucking android phones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So now how many parameters as a </v>

847
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.131
<v Speaker 5>developer do you need to deal with?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because all those phones have different </v>

848
00:39:08.131 --> 00:39:11.191
<v Speaker 5>attributes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So the way they take a picture is </v>

849
00:39:11.191 --> 00:39:13.441
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So going in and trying to figure out </v>

850
00:39:13.441 --> 00:39:15.211
<v Speaker 5>what to remove in terms of bits and </v>
<v Speaker 5>bytes to still have a good picture on </v>

851
00:39:15.211 --> 00:39:19.021
<v Speaker 5>the other side is very difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's not necessarily a technical </v>

852
00:39:19.021 --> 00:39:21.670
<v Speaker 5>limitation on the side of the device.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The galaxy s five for example,</v>

853
00:39:21.671 --> 00:39:26.671
<v Speaker 5>has a great camera,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a great camera until you try to upload </v>

854
00:39:26.671 --> 00:39:26.671
<v Speaker 5>to instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

855
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:28.020
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking</v>

856
00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:33.050
<v Speaker 4>talking about taking photos on my camera</v>
<v Speaker 4>on both and trying to take the best </v>

857
00:39:34.471 --> 00:39:34.890
<v Speaker 4>photos,</v>

858
00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:35.710
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

859
00:39:35.711 --> 00:39:36.130
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's.</v>

860
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:37.940
<v Speaker 5>That exists.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is a great camera.</v>

861
00:39:37.941 --> 00:39:39.650
<v Speaker 5>Don't get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It has a big aperture.</v>

862
00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:44.120
<v Speaker 5>Is still like in terms of mass market,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can argue this against the Nokia one</v>

863
00:39:44.121 --> 00:39:46.490
<v Speaker 5>just because that's how it hangs off the</v>
<v Speaker 5>back.</v>

864
00:39:46.491 --> 00:39:51.491
<v Speaker 5>It's a giant thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what I'm saying is the bigger </v>

865
00:39:51.491 --> 00:39:54.881
<v Speaker 5>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe the bigger problem is the </v>

866
00:39:54.881 --> 00:39:54.881
<v Speaker 5>instagram problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People,</v>

867
00:39:54.881 --> 00:39:58.300
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people hit me up on twitter all the </v>

868
00:39:58.300 --> 00:39:58.300
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like my photos look great.</v>

869
00:39:58.300 --> 00:39:58.460
<v Speaker 5>Then I uploaded it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>looked like mud.</v>

870
00:39:58.461 --> 00:39:59.710
<v Speaker 5>They looked like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

871
00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.360
<v Speaker 5>once I get them up there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So this,</v>

872
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:07.390
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this goes deep tech guys will carry </v>

873
00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:07.730
<v Speaker 5>around two devices for that specific </v>
<v Speaker 5>reason.</v>

874
00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:12.170
<v Speaker 5>I will take pictures on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even if I took a picture on here,</v>

875
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.110
<v Speaker 5>but if I uploaded it on here it would be</v>
<v Speaker 5>different.</v>

876
00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:16.700
<v Speaker 5>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

877
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.270
<v Speaker 5>it's crazy.</v>

878
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:22.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean when I upload my photos from both</v>
<v Speaker 4>of my devices that note three and my </v>

879
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:27.701
<v Speaker 4>iphone five s all my fucking phone's all</v>
<v Speaker 4>my gal or notes photos are shit compared</v>

880
00:40:29.781 --> 00:40:31.430
<v Speaker 4>to this camera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not as good.</v>

881
00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:36.580
<v Speaker 4>And if you have a program like instagram</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is taking random,</v>

882
00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:42.220
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of times I use instagram </v>
<v Speaker 4>but just like photos I find on the </v>

883
00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:42.220
<v Speaker 4>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like screenshots,</v>

884
00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:47.530
<v Speaker 4>that's another good example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And those programs should be able to be </v>

885
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:47.530
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

886
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:49.250
<v Speaker 4>we're going to make everything a </v>
<v Speaker 4>screenshot that's uploaded through this,</v>

887
00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:51.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>algorithm like meaning.</v>

888
00:40:51.111 --> 00:40:53.090
<v Speaker 4>Like if you have a photo that's taken on</v>
<v Speaker 4>one camera,</v>

889
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:56.210
<v Speaker 4>you have a screenshot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a camera that you uploaded,</v>

890
00:40:56.211 --> 00:41:01.211
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All those photos should be able to go </v>

891
00:41:01.211 --> 00:41:03.641
<v Speaker 4>through one single program and thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're all going to transfer this </v>

892
00:41:03.641 --> 00:41:04.940
<v Speaker 4>into what a screenshot is of that phone </v>
<v Speaker 4>or whatever.</v>

893
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:09.040
<v Speaker 4>Meaning it shouldn't be like who cares </v>
<v Speaker 4>if it what different photos that is.</v>

894
00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:13.520
<v Speaker 4>It's the programming that should be able</v>
<v Speaker 4>to interpret it and no doubt about it,</v>

895
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:18.550
<v Speaker 4>but it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you say you're the developer on </v>

896
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.550
<v Speaker 4>Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

897
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:19.580
<v Speaker 4>instagram is not really making much </v>
<v Speaker 4>money right now anyways,</v>

898
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.230
<v Speaker 4>but if you're good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could they be.</v>

899
00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:24.640
<v Speaker 4>That's a question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean people pay for Instagram,</v>

900
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:30.390
<v Speaker 4>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>facial recognition so that they can own </v>

901
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.390
<v Speaker 4>all your apps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One APP,</v>

902
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:35.380
<v Speaker 4>download it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You downloaded for free or do you pay </v>

903
00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:35.380
<v Speaker 4>for it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

904
00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:35.380
<v Speaker 4>it's a free app,</v>

905
00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:39.460
<v Speaker 5>but at the u you will eventually start </v>
<v Speaker 5>to see promoted instagram posts from </v>

906
00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.640
<v Speaker 5>brands in your feed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No choice.</v>

907
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:44.200
<v Speaker 5>Twitter's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do they own what I was doing?</v>

908
00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.030
<v Speaker 5>They gross me out when they do read </v>
<v Speaker 5>them.</v>

909
00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:50.600
<v Speaker 5>Promoting your friend is following x </v>
<v Speaker 5>brand's instagram.</v>

910
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.300
<v Speaker 5>Own your photos.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are they allowed to use whatever?</v>

911
00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:58.760
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they recently they updated their tos </v>

912
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.821
<v Speaker 5>because they said that and then people </v>
<v Speaker 5>freaked out and then they monitored it </v>

913
00:42:00.821 --> 00:42:04.181
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure what the current state of </v>

914
00:42:04.181 --> 00:42:04.181
<v Speaker 5>their terms of services,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

915
00:42:04.181 --> 00:42:08.830
<v Speaker 5>honestly instagram is probably my </v>
<v Speaker 5>favorite social network outside of </v>

916
00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:10.700
<v Speaker 5>youtube because it's streamlined.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's images,</v>

917
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 5>it's fast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not too much.</v>

918
00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:14.930
<v Speaker 5>Facebook is a disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

919
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:20.110
<v Speaker 5>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure that's why they </v>

920
00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:20.110
<v Speaker 5>purchased them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For example,</v>

921
00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:20.570
<v Speaker 5>if I put a picture on Instagram from an </v>
<v Speaker 5>interactivity stamp,</v>

922
00:42:20.571 --> 00:42:21.020
<v Speaker 5>this is how,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

923
00:42:21.021 --> 00:42:22.850
<v Speaker 5>software is working when people want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>use it.</v>

924
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:28.090
<v Speaker 5>If I put a picture on Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the comment stream is happening </v>

925
00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:28.670
<v Speaker 5>faster than anywhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though I don't have the same number</v>

926
00:42:28.671 --> 00:42:33.671
<v Speaker 5>of followers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were a lot of douchebags on </v>

927
00:42:33.671 --> 00:42:33.671
<v Speaker 5>instagram though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

928
00:42:33.671 --> 00:42:35.240
<v Speaker 5>maybe more than on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

929
00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:37.850
<v Speaker 5>Lauren,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can we do a Douche bag?</v>

930
00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.720
<v Speaker 5>Is Definition when you say douchebag </v>
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>

931
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:45.200
<v Speaker 5>I'm curious as to the what specifically?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just dumb assholes.</v>

932
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.620
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

933
00:42:45.910 --> 00:42:46.540
<v Speaker 5>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

934
00:42:46.541 --> 00:42:51.541
<v Speaker 5>Lots of the assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you ever go to Kim Kardashians </v>

935
00:42:51.541 --> 00:42:52.180
<v Speaker 5>instagram page,</v>
<v Speaker 5>none of them a little weasel.</v>

936
00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:55.640
<v Speaker 5>Go there and just read some of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking comments about children.</v>

937
00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:59.480
<v Speaker 5>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anything that's a fucking.</v>

938
00:42:59.481 --> 00:43:01.610
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it's.</v>

939
00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Diluted Youtube.</v>

940
00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:04.980
<v Speaker 5>It's because it's you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

941
00:43:04.981 --> 00:43:09.981
<v Speaker 5>you're commenting on a photo or a video </v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of a twitter where you're just </v>

942
00:43:09.981 --> 00:43:11.750
<v Speaker 5>talking about words.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I honestly think anything worth anything</v>

943
00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:13.370
<v Speaker 5>should be comments,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deleted,</v>

944
00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:18.290
<v Speaker 5>comics disabled,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the problem is they very rarely,</v>

945
00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.510
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's rare that you.</v>

946
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.810
<v Speaker 5>It generates a really fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation in the comments.</v>

947
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.650
<v Speaker 5>It's super common.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is just shitheads.</v>

948
00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:29.060
<v Speaker 5>It depends on the subject matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In my case,</v>

949
00:43:29.061 --> 00:43:31.250
<v Speaker 5>sometimes I do get relevant discussion </v>
<v Speaker 5>in the comments,</v>

950
00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.640
<v Speaker 5>a tech discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they're pretty respectful,</v>

951
00:43:34.641 --> 00:43:37.520
<v Speaker 5>but you do get this weird fanboys and </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff that gets militant.</v>

952
00:43:37.521 --> 00:43:40.070
<v Speaker 5>Surprisingly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a more way.</v>

953
00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:44.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have this theory like,</v>

954
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:47.420
<v Speaker 5>you know when you go to a coffee shop </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you look around you at starbucks,</v>

955
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:52.510
<v Speaker 5>everyone has their phones on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You notice that like it's in a public </v>

956
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:52.510
<v Speaker 5>space.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

957
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:56.930
<v Speaker 5>it's like representative of you in some </v>
<v Speaker 5>way and I have this feeling that this is</v>

958
00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.750
<v Speaker 5>for a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a major investment,</v>

959
00:43:59.751 --> 00:44:01.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>outside of their car or whatever.</v>

960
00:44:01.401 --> 00:44:03.260
<v Speaker 5>It's really close to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's in your pocket all the time.</v>

961
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:08.530
<v Speaker 5>And so I think people are really </v>
<v Speaker 5>concerned with making the wrong </v>

962
00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:08.530
<v Speaker 5>decision,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

963
00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:10.310
<v Speaker 5>they're really concerned that their </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing is not the best.</v>

964
00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:15.880
<v Speaker 5>And so in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what will happen is I'll put up a video </v>

965
00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:15.880
<v Speaker 5>within,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

966
00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:20.200
<v Speaker 5>they haven't even had time to finish </v>
<v Speaker 5>watching it and apple socs or android </v>

967
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.320
<v Speaker 5>sucks or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And really it's fear.</v>

968
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.340
<v Speaker 5>It's fear that you made the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 5>decision and so,</v>

969
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:27.140
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like many places in life,</v>

970
00:44:27.141 --> 00:44:29.450
<v Speaker 5>you get angry when you're afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>

971
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:34.630
<v Speaker 5>God forbid a new product comes out that </v>
<v Speaker 5>obsoletes yours and you don't have the </v>

972
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.850
<v Speaker 5>money to replace it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you,</v>

973
00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:39.920
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you take this position of defending the </v>

974
00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:40.770
<v Speaker 5>other thing because that's easier than </v>
<v Speaker 5>justifying the cost of the new one.</v>

975
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:41.990
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

976
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:42.810
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've actually,</v>

977
00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:47.890
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there were a couple of really cool </v>

978
00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:48.190
<v Speaker 5>articles on Fanboy ism that I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>interviewed for and you know,</v>

979
00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.980
<v Speaker 5>we went,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we went deep into how,</v>

980
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:51.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how people sort of figure that out.</v>

981
00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:57.170
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's definitely this undercurrent </v>

982
00:44:57.170 --> 00:45:01.130
<v Speaker 5>below the tech space,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the consumer product space where these </v>

983
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:02.430
<v Speaker 5>are becoming more and more like fashion </v>
<v Speaker 5>symbols,</v>

984
00:45:02.431 --> 00:45:04.080
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>

985
00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:04.590
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>rep,</v>

986
00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:08.280
<v Speaker 5>representative of your personality maybe</v>
<v Speaker 5>more so than this then as a tool,</v>

987
00:45:08.281 --> 00:45:08.850
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>less,</v>

988
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:12.360
<v Speaker 5>less of a hammer and more like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a piece of jewelry,</v>

989
00:45:12.361 --> 00:45:13.140
<v Speaker 5>like a watch or something.</v>

990
00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:16.050
<v Speaker 5>Isn't it also that people just love </v>
<v Speaker 5>being on teams,</v>

991
00:45:16.051 --> 00:45:17.140
<v Speaker 5>whether it's team.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

992
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:21.000
<v Speaker 5>Publican team shelly most,</v>
<v Speaker 5>most definitely.</v>

993
00:45:21.001 --> 00:45:23.190
<v Speaker 5>And I've done some rants on this in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>past.</v>

994
00:45:23.191 --> 00:45:28.191
<v Speaker 5>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel the need to tell people like I'm </v>

995
00:45:28.191 --> 00:45:28.191
<v Speaker 5>a fan of technology when I was coming up</v>
<v Speaker 5>as a kid,</v>

996
00:45:28.191 --> 00:45:30.750
<v Speaker 5>like if anybody brought me any of this </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff I would,</v>

997
00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:34.320
<v Speaker 5>I would be super excited of course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm cool with saying that,</v>

998
00:45:34.321 --> 00:45:36.300
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but uh,</v>

999
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.650
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is,</v>

1000
00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:40.890
<v Speaker 5>there is definitely a team aspect where </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1001
00:45:40.891 --> 00:45:45.210
<v Speaker 5>they want to belong to something I say </v>
<v Speaker 5>belong to team technology if that's what</v>

1002
00:45:45.211 --> 00:45:50.211
<v Speaker 5>you're into because the truth is these </v>
<v Speaker 5>devices and these platforms push one </v>

1003
00:45:50.211 --> 00:45:54.261
<v Speaker 5>another that the positive things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened in android push ios to be </v>

1004
00:45:54.261 --> 00:45:58.791
<v Speaker 5>better in the positive things that </v>
<v Speaker 5>happened in Ios push android to be </v>

1005
00:45:58.791 --> 00:45:59.490
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the same thing goes for laptops,</v>

1006
00:45:59.491 --> 00:46:00.570
<v Speaker 5>desktops really anywhere.</v>

1007
00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:05.570
<v Speaker 5>There's innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Having a little bit of competition is a </v>

1008
00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:05.570
<v Speaker 5>positive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1009
00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:09.831
<v Speaker 5>unquestionably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think that it's important that </v>

1010
00:46:09.831 --> 00:46:11.340
<v Speaker 5>there's all this competition out there </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's important that there's debate,</v>

1011
00:46:11.341 --> 00:46:15.050
<v Speaker 5>but people just have to be good is just </v>
<v Speaker 5>assholes.</v>

1012
00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:16.680
<v Speaker 5>So solar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's true as well.</v>

1013
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:17.970
<v Speaker 5>Really what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're out there.</v>

1014
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
<v Speaker 5>People just getting off slobber mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well if there their various platforms </v>

1015
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.650
<v Speaker 5>need to do right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting angry is probably the easiest </v>

1016
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:27.650
<v Speaker 5>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1017
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:29.240
<v Speaker 5>like I mean in terms of emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anger is,</v>

1018
00:46:29.241 --> 00:46:33.600
<v Speaker 5>is a reaction that people that don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have the ability to process something,</v>

1019
00:46:33.601 --> 00:46:35.370
<v Speaker 5>they choose anger.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the easiest one.</v>

1020
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:37.020
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>

1021
00:46:37.021 --> 00:46:40.770
<v Speaker 5>any kind of like those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those are not the dominating comments.</v>

1022
00:46:40.771 --> 00:46:45.771
<v Speaker 5>I not definitely not on my stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The dominating ones are more along the </v>

1023
00:46:45.771 --> 00:46:47.130
<v Speaker 5>lines of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1024
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:48.720
<v Speaker 5>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>technology in general,</v>

1025
00:46:48.721 --> 00:46:49.890
<v Speaker 5>being happy about innovation.</v>

1026
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:54.890
<v Speaker 5>You post a new unboxing video of one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>these things and everybody's cool with </v>

1027
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:58.011
<v Speaker 5>it and everybody's interested and that's</v>
<v Speaker 5>part of the reason why people watch my </v>

1028
00:46:58.011 --> 00:46:58.740
<v Speaker 5>videos is because they sort of want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>see.</v>

1029
00:46:58.830 --> 00:47:01.810
<v Speaker 5>They want to see the whole movement of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the place in general.</v>

1030
00:47:01.811 --> 00:47:03.210
<v Speaker 5>Like I could,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it could have been an apple channel.</v>

1031
00:47:03.211 --> 00:47:05.160
<v Speaker 5>A lot of people do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they'll have like an,</v>

1032
00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:10.220
<v Speaker 5>an ios related channel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether they'll do app reviews </v>

1033
00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:10.220
<v Speaker 5>specifically for a platform or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

1034
00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:10.320
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1035
00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:15.620
<v Speaker 5>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to give them a bad rap </v>

1036
00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:15.620
<v Speaker 5>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not all Douche bag.</v>

1037
00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:15.620
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1038
00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:15.620
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's not.</v>

1039
00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:16.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's a small,</v>

1040
00:47:16.681 --> 00:47:18.510
<v Speaker 5>loud minority really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1041
00:47:18.511 --> 00:47:21.960
<v Speaker 5>but that loud minority can ruin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a problem.</v>

1042
00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:26.040
<v Speaker 5>I mean a youtube implemented this idea </v>
<v Speaker 5>where you have your real name,</v>

1043
00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:27.380
<v Speaker 5>that's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1044
00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:30.110
<v Speaker 5>I love that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They show a fucking picture of you two</v>

1045
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:32.530
<v Speaker 3>and a picture of you when you wake up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the morning.</v>

1046
00:47:32.531 --> 00:47:36.580
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So and so cocky now about Kim Kardashian</v>

1047
00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.220
<v Speaker 3>run little cute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1048
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:42.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's one way to remove </v>
<v Speaker 3>anonymity on the web,</v>

1049
00:47:42.701 --> 00:47:44.710
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people don't necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1050
00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:46.060
<v Speaker 3>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Reddit.</v>

1051
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:51.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could there ever be your real identity </v>

1052
00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:51.120
<v Speaker 3>on reddit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

1053
00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:51.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1054
00:47:51.121 --> 00:47:52.900
<v Speaker 3>there's benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's pros and cons.</v>

1055
00:47:52.901 --> 00:47:57.901
<v Speaker 3>There's benefits to anonymity because a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of times you'll get truth that </v>

1056
00:47:57.901 --> 00:47:59.430
<v Speaker 3>someone might shield from you because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the social stigma,</v>

1057
00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:01.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just social cues and interactions.</v>

1058
00:48:01.691 --> 00:48:03.320
<v Speaker 3>They might just back off of it and go </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

1059
00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:05.800
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't honest with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go to see someone in a movie,</v>

1060
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when you think man,</v>

1061
00:48:07.151 --> 00:48:11.260
<v Speaker 3>like Oh fucking piece of shit to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you go home,</v>

1062
00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:12.400
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty fucking good man.</v>

1063
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:16.390
<v Speaker 3>If you were a random guy that there's so</v>
<v Speaker 3>many things wrong with this movie,</v>

1064
00:48:16.391 --> 00:48:19.000
<v Speaker 3>they should burn it on the Marae for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

1065
00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:21.550
<v Speaker 3>Say something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you would really mean that.</v>

1066
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:26.910
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that things are better for </v>

1067
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:29.350
<v Speaker 3>people having that ability or would they</v>
<v Speaker 3>be better in the alternative space where</v>

1068
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:31.300
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you know anyways,</v>

1069
00:48:31.301 --> 00:48:36.301
<v Speaker 3>right when somebody really isn't into </v>
<v Speaker 3>something they don't really need to say </v>

1070
00:48:36.301 --> 00:48:36.301
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they know?</v>

1071
00:48:36.301 --> 00:48:36.820
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can feel it,</v>

1072
00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:41.020
<v Speaker 3>but I think that interaction in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think first of all,</v>

1073
00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:46.140
<v Speaker 3>I think this stage that we're in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage of commenting and being able to </v>

1074
00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:49.840
<v Speaker 3>interact with people online,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like you put up a video,</v>

1075
00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:55.050
<v Speaker 3>they could just shit all over your face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the face guys doing something.</v>

1076
00:48:56.681 --> 00:49:01.681
<v Speaker 3>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just decide that this is a new ability </v>

1077
00:49:01.681 --> 00:49:01.681
<v Speaker 3>that's never existed.</v>

1078
00:49:01.681 --> 00:49:04.090
<v Speaker 3>A decade ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two decades ago,</v>

1079
00:49:04.091 --> 00:49:06.250
<v Speaker 3>there was nothing remotely similar to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1080
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:11.370
<v Speaker 3>Not that we don't really know how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with it and there's so many people </v>

1081
00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:12.640
<v Speaker 3>that just get away with doing things on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1082
00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:17.820
<v Speaker 3>They would never do in real life share </v>
<v Speaker 3>just because they really shouldn't have </v>

1083
00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:17.820
<v Speaker 3>that ability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not a natural ability.</v>

1084
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:22.910
<v Speaker 3>The natural ability to communicate with </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other is it's an ebb and flow </v>

1085
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:24.280
<v Speaker 3>interact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not send a missile and sit back and</v>

1086
00:49:24.281 --> 00:49:26.440
<v Speaker 3>wait to explode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1087
00:49:26.441 --> 00:49:27.100
<v Speaker 3>that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1088
00:49:27.101 --> 00:49:29.110
<v Speaker 3>not that you have the art form of </v>
<v Speaker 3>trolling,</v>

1089
00:49:29.111 --> 00:49:32.260
<v Speaker 3>like that's a whole thing and it is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>art form when done.</v>

1090
00:49:32.261 --> 00:49:37.261
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's sometimes there's this new </v>

1091
00:49:37.261 --> 00:49:40.921
<v Speaker 3>website that I just started following or</v>
<v Speaker 3>new twitter feed that I just started </v>

1092
00:49:40.921 --> 00:49:40.921
<v Speaker 3>following.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a total troll.</v>

1093
00:49:40.921 --> 00:49:42.490
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a parody account.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Troll,</v>

1094
00:49:42.491 --> 00:49:44.680
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turns into a troll.</v>

1095
00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:49.070
<v Speaker 3>I shot almost not say the name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anybody.</v>

1096
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:50.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well fuck it.</v>

1097
00:49:50.081 --> 00:49:52.210
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all about salon.com</v>

1098
00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:55.660
<v Speaker 3>and it's salon like their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their twitter handle.</v>

1099
00:49:55.661 --> 00:49:59.140
<v Speaker 3>I think his salon.com,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's salon.</v>

1100
00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.320
<v Speaker 3>That is one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twitter handle their salon.com.</v>

1101
00:50:02.321 --> 00:50:07.321
<v Speaker 3>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say I'll find out who it is on salon is </v>

1102
00:50:07.321 --> 00:50:10.180
<v Speaker 3>the official verified one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

1103
00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:12.810
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called Salon yet.</v>

1104
00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:15.940
<v Speaker 3>Salon.com</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's hilarious.</v>

1105
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:17.830
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really funny.</v>

1106
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:20.320
<v Speaker 3>The unfortunate part of that is them </v>
<v Speaker 3>using that name.</v>

1107
00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:25.321
<v Speaker 3>Maybe a problem in the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're the one that you're want to </v>

1108
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:26.500
<v Speaker 3>announce that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

1109
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:28.710
<v Speaker 3>they need more people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

1110
00:50:28.711 --> 00:50:30.650
<v Speaker 3>It's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

1111
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:35.480
<v Speaker 3>there was one about a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a misogynist superheroes,</v>

1112
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.300
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Men's rights activists are wearing capes</v>

1113
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:44.390
<v Speaker 3>and they're just trolling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really funny,</v>

1114
00:50:44.391 --> 00:50:45.040
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1115
00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.600
<v Speaker 3>If it's sophisticated and well thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1116
00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.220
<v Speaker 3>it's acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In my opinion,</v>

1117
00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:54.250
<v Speaker 3>Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the six most popular video games that </v>

1118
00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:54.250
<v Speaker 3>allow you to kill female players online.</v>

1119
00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last antisemitic slur.</v>

1120
00:50:58.821 --> 00:51:01.250
<v Speaker 3>We need to stop using the j word </v>
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>

1121
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:02.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just trolling.</v>

1122
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:05.150
<v Speaker 3>This is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's gold.</v>

1123
00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:07.850
<v Speaker 3>I like this kind of trolling because if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to the fucking comments,</v>

1124
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:12.880
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people that do not </v>

1125
00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:12.880
<v Speaker 3>think this is trolling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1126
00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:12.880
<v Speaker 3>Isn't this the kind of trolling you </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight.</v>

1127
00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:14.210
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1128
00:51:14.211 --> 00:51:16.040
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because this is obvious,</v>

1129
00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:21.310
<v Speaker 3>but mom errands or gay for 10 year olds </v>
<v Speaker 3>vile rant to proves what a homophobic </v>

1130
00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:26.141
<v Speaker 3>patriarchy we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it.</v>

1131
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:31.360
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a place for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This place.</v>

1132
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:32.660
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>If it's look,</v>

1134
00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:37.510
<v Speaker 3>you don't deserve to be able to come and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it should be your,</v>

1135
00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.890
<v Speaker 3>your test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you really believe this,</v>

1136
00:51:39.891 --> 00:51:41.780
<v Speaker 3>you either not paying attention like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're half awake.</v>

1137
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:45.410
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel about this?</v>

1138
00:51:45.411 --> 00:51:50.411
<v Speaker 3>What if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if there was some like reputation </v>

1139
00:51:50.411 --> 00:51:52.421
<v Speaker 3>attached to your name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like because that's essentially what's </v>

1140
00:51:52.421 --> 00:51:52.421
<v Speaker 3>happening on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1141
00:51:52.421 --> 00:51:55.940
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you log onto a video and it happens </v>

1142
00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:56.150
<v Speaker 3>to be somebody in your google plus </v>
<v Speaker 3>circles,</v>

1143
00:51:56.151 --> 00:51:58.270
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll rise to the top of the.</v>

1144
00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.710
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why you shouldn't use google plus</v>

1145
00:52:00.711 --> 00:52:04.250
<v Speaker 3>because that's retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have a choice for commenting.</v>

1146
00:52:04.251 --> 00:52:06.430
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 signs your cat might be racist.</v>

1147
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:15.220
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1148
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:20.280
<v Speaker 3>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of different ways to </v>

1149
00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:20.280
<v Speaker 3>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's any,</v>

1150
00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.210
<v Speaker 3>there's any absolute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think ultimately the real issue is</v>

1151
00:52:23.211 --> 00:52:25.010
<v Speaker 3>that we're just not used to this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom,</v>

1152
00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:28.340
<v Speaker 3>this freedom of communication and </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom of interaction,</v>

1153
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:30.730
<v Speaker 3>freedom of reaching people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feeding them.</v>

1154
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:34.820
<v Speaker 3>You mean there's websites dedicated to </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like anything.</v>

1155
00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:37.670
<v Speaker 3>Like you could reach people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can contact people,</v>

1156
00:52:37.671 --> 00:52:39.320
<v Speaker 3>you could comment on people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

1157
00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:41.660
<v Speaker 3>you could start your own website and </v>
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

1158
00:52:41.661 --> 00:52:42.890
<v Speaker 3>people comment on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>

1159
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:44.540
<v Speaker 3>this kind of interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1160
00:52:44.810 --> 00:52:47.410
<v Speaker 3>it's completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an adolescent thing,</v>

1161
00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:52.580
<v Speaker 3>so when you have cases like that guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that got fired because they outed him on</v>

1162
00:52:52.581 --> 00:52:57.581
<v Speaker 3>Reddit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he used to do a lot of creepy shit on </v>

1163
00:52:57.581 --> 00:52:57.581
<v Speaker 3>reddit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember that guy in Texas,</v>

1164
00:52:57.581 --> 00:52:57.990
<v Speaker 3>I believe he lived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1165
00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:01.130
<v Speaker 3>his name was something acres or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1166
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:06.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was a really interesting debate </v>

1167
00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:06.860
<v Speaker 3>because obviously the guy was really </v>
<v Speaker 3>creepy online,</v>

1168
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:10.400
<v Speaker 3>but to him it was like a role that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was playing to him.</v>

1169
00:53:10.401 --> 00:53:15.401
<v Speaker 3>He got enjoyment out of this trolling </v>
<v Speaker 3>and posting pictures of dead people and </v>

1170
00:53:15.651 --> 00:53:18.320
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His big one was creep shots,</v>

1171
00:53:18.321 --> 00:53:20.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so,</v>

1172
00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:23.300
<v Speaker 3>like an up the skirt type picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which surprisingly,</v>

1173
00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:26.100
<v Speaker 3>for a long time if you searched for</v>

1174
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 2>reddit it was the top hit was like slash</v>
<v Speaker 2>creeps shots.</v>

1175
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:32.550
<v Speaker 2>So I want to know who's searching reddit</v>
<v Speaker 2>for creep shots.</v>

1176
00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:32.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

1177
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:37.910
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They banked a lot of dough on that guys </v>

1178
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.910
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

1179
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1180
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:38.780
<v Speaker 1>read it did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

1181
00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:43.810
<v Speaker 1>if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're accumulating traffic through </v>

1182
00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Google searches right to that particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>thread,</v>

1183
00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:45.980
<v Speaker 1>ultimately they earn money through </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising revenue.</v>

1184
00:53:45.981 --> 00:53:49.160
<v Speaker 1>Like anyone else keeping people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to write,</v>

1185
00:53:49.161 --> 00:53:52.000
<v Speaker 1>but they're an open forum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely Open Forum.</v>

1186
00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:54.920
<v Speaker 1>Not Completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not completely because of moderated.</v>

1187
00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying that by them </v>

1188
00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.490
<v Speaker 1>tolerating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If so,</v>

1189
00:54:01.491 --> 00:54:03.610
<v Speaker 1>if it could be proved to the stollery </v>
<v Speaker 1>though he got,</v>

1190
00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:06.320
<v Speaker 1>he got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a red or a trophy,</v>

1191
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:08.570
<v Speaker 1>a statute for being one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>moderators.</v>

1192
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:11.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he did a lot of ups shots.</v>

1193
00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creep shots was I think maybe the most </v>

1194
00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:17.170
<v Speaker 1>famous thread or a subreddit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

1195
00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ran a subreddit called creep shots </v>

1196
00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:21.460
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was another one.</v>

1197
00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

1198
00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So reddit knew about the subreddit?</v>

1199
00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1200
00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:28.800
<v Speaker 1>that shit's sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you guys all.</v>

1201
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Kilts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Scottish.</v>

1202
00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:33.040
<v Speaker 2>Still a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1203
00:54:33.041 --> 00:54:35.110
<v Speaker 2>like the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the under age ones though.</v>

1204
00:54:35.111 --> 00:54:39.820
<v Speaker 2>He was also on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm under 18 only and I think,</v>

1205
00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:44.500
<v Speaker 2>I believe the goal was to attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 2>harvest pictures from girls,</v>

1206
00:54:44.501 --> 00:54:47.560
<v Speaker 2>facebook accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would pretend to be,</v>

1207
00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:49.930
<v Speaker 2>you'd have like one of their friend's </v>
<v Speaker 2>profile pictures.</v>

1208
00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:52.240
<v Speaker 2>You'd beat somebody at their school or I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't fake it,</v>

1209
00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:57.870
<v Speaker 2>get access and then pulled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pulled down the facebook photos and </v>

1210
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:58.240
<v Speaker 2>upload them to the girls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had no idea they were showing up on this</v>

1211
00:54:58.250 --> 00:55:00.550
<v Speaker 2>subreddit until they found out at school</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next day.</v>

1212
00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is so fucked up.</v>

1213
00:55:02.631 --> 00:55:04.820
<v Speaker 1>And that was a grown man doing that to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little girl.</v>

1214
00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:09.850
<v Speaker 1>And guess what the moderator's job was </v>
<v Speaker 1>to remove pictures of girls that look </v>

1215
00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:12.260
<v Speaker 1>too old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1216
00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:16.070
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your thoughts about that?</v>

1217
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:16.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1218
00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:19.710
<v Speaker 2>I have a love hate relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>reddit.</v>

1219
00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Like this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's an open forum is one that </v>

1220
00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:26.430
<v Speaker 2>everybody believes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the vast majority of reddit users or</v>

1221
00:55:26.431 --> 00:55:29.640
<v Speaker 2>consumers and producers right there just</v>
<v Speaker 2>user to consume content.</v>

1222
00:55:29.641 --> 00:55:32.850
<v Speaker 2>You would never know if you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing an open forum or not.</v>

1223
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.040
<v Speaker 2>You're not managing it in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1224
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:40.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like super against self </v>

1225
00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:40.100
<v Speaker 2>promotion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1226
00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:44.780
<v Speaker 2>And this is how I've bumped into them a </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of times because I'll tweet out </v>

1227
00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:44.780
<v Speaker 2>if somebody's talking about me on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Reddit,</v>

1228
00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I'll tweet the link right on numerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>occasions tweeting that link brought the</v>

1229
00:55:48.571 --> 00:55:49.230
<v Speaker 2>whole post down.</v>

1230
00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1231
00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:55.440
<v Speaker 2>I just stayed in my sobriety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't go out of Reddit March.</v>

1232
00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.750
<v Speaker 2>I think it's good for certain things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1233
00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:01.800
<v Speaker 2>like I use it for episode discussions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a podcast,</v>

1234
00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:06.050
<v Speaker 2>the subreddit and Joe suburbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still human beings.</v>

1235
00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.920
<v Speaker 2>There's obviously cool people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1236
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:12.950
<v Speaker 2>that's not up for discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these veiled moderators in the </v>

1237
00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:14.430
<v Speaker 2>background Canis essentially shape your </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>

1238
00:56:14.431 --> 00:56:14.730
<v Speaker 2>There</v>

1239
00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:18.950
<v Speaker 1>is also been issues with censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexis Ohanian,</v>

1240
00:56:18.951 --> 00:56:23.951
<v Speaker 1>when he was on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about issues of things being </v>

1241
00:56:23.951 --> 00:56:24.550
<v Speaker 1>censored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a technology forums.</v>

1242
00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

1243
00:56:25.590 --> 00:56:26.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1244
00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:28.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain certain keywords.</v>

1245
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain keywords would knock the post </v>

1246
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:33.150
<v Speaker 1>down immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't type in those keywords.</v>

1247
00:56:33.150 --> 00:56:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Bull or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I strange list of keyword.</v>

1248
00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Someone did a little investigation on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1249
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:37.500
<v Speaker 2>They did a little study.</v>

1250
00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that's still the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't attempted it.</v>

1251
00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:43.880
<v Speaker 1>We actually found this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was after Alexis was here,</v>

1252
00:56:43.881 --> 00:56:45.620
<v Speaker 1>so we didn't get a chance to ask him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1253
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:47.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1254
00:56:47.031 --> 00:56:52.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're making money off of the fact </v>

1255
00:56:52.031 --> 00:56:55.931
<v Speaker 1>that their forum gets a tremendous </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of traffic and you have a </v>

1256
00:56:55.931 --> 00:56:58.100
<v Speaker 1>subreddit that you're aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone must be aware of that,</v>

1257
00:56:58.101 --> 00:56:59.000
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1258
00:56:59.001 --> 00:57:00.350
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not there anymore,</v>

1259
00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:05.380
<v Speaker 1>but how crazy is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The you're censoring things like the </v>

1260
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:07.970
<v Speaker 1>word apple or Samsung or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the technology words are,</v>

1261
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:13.080
<v Speaker 1>you're censoring that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not censoring obscured shots </v>

1262
00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:13.080
<v Speaker 1>of 18 year old.</v>

<v Speaker 2>They don't want.</v>

1265
00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:24.380
<v Speaker 2>They don't want people come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want people hacking their </v>

1266
00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:28.251
<v Speaker 2>system in a way finding a way to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>exposure through their platform without </v>

1267
00:57:28.251 --> 00:57:28.251
<v Speaker 2>paying for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1268
00:57:28.251 --> 00:57:28.650
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1269
00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:29.450
<v Speaker 2>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>

1270
00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:32.040
<v Speaker 2>doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if facebook promoted posts,</v>

1271

<v Speaker 2>I don't know how active you guys are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1273
00:57:35.221 --> 00:57:37.350
<v Speaker 2>your post is reaching what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like five,</v>

1274
00:57:37.351 --> 00:57:41.340
<v Speaker 2>10 percent of the actual audience that </v>
<v Speaker 2>signed up to see your posts and Oh,</v>

1276
00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:44.310
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1277
00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:49.330
<v Speaker 2>that's inevitably where we end up on any</v>
<v Speaker 2>of this shit is that eventually they </v>

1278
00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:49.890
<v Speaker 2>hook you and then they find a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>monetize.</v>

1279
00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:51.410
<v Speaker 2>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel about bitcoin?</v>

1280
00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:53.970
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about electronic </v>
<v Speaker 2>currency and love it.</v>

1281
00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super Cool.</v>

1282
00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1283
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:59.070
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1284
00:57:59.071 --> 00:57:59.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1285
00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:03.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an expert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that money is super low tech</v>

1286
00:58:03.511 --> 00:58:05.340
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Money socks right now,</v>

1287
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:10.510
<v Speaker 2>like this idea that there's this </v>
<v Speaker 2>intermediary body that needs to sit in </v>

1288
00:58:10.561 --> 00:58:13.620
<v Speaker 2>between you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we want to exchange money that that's</v>

1289
00:58:13.621 --> 00:58:18.621
<v Speaker 2>bizarre in today's Day and age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I can send you email that can be </v>

1290
00:58:18.621 --> 00:58:18.621
<v Speaker 2>encrypted and here's how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1291
00:58:18.621 --> 00:58:19.890
<v Speaker 2>it's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have all the money</v>

1292
00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:25.560
<v Speaker 1>deal is rigged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's messed up.</v>

1293
00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:28.200
<v Speaker 1>What they're providing is really not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that big of a deal.</v>

1294
00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Are they storing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they do?</v>

1295
00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Their processing a bunch of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly in computers today.</v>

1296
00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:33.610
<v Speaker 1>And that's</v>

1297
00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:38.610
<v Speaker 2>what bitcoin proved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoin proved it because bitcoin was </v>

1298
00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:41.230
<v Speaker 2>able to process transactions on an </v>
<v Speaker 2>enormous scale that was bigger than a,</v>

1299
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:45.610
<v Speaker 2>than an independent institution and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were able to do it in a,</v>

1300
00:58:45.611 --> 00:58:46.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

1301
00:58:46.301 --> 00:58:51.301
<v Speaker 2>in a fashion that's completely secure </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were able to do it for free </v>

1302
00:58:51.301 --> 00:58:52.960
<v Speaker 2>without any kind of venture capital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1303
00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:56.380
<v Speaker 2>If he didn't like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about the fees you paid or how big</v>

1304
00:58:56.381 --> 00:59:01.381
<v Speaker 2>the banks or go to any city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The biggest skyscrapers or the big </v>

1305
00:59:01.381 --> 00:59:01.381
<v Speaker 2>banks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1306
00:59:01.381 --> 00:59:03.490
<v Speaker 2>Insurance companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial institutions,</v>

1307
00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:08.520
<v Speaker 2>crooks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the crooks in their big fucking </v>

1308
00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:08.520
<v Speaker 2>capital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1309
00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.660
<v Speaker 2>you think about a bitcoin came out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>out and all those guys,</v>

1310
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:15.610
<v Speaker 2>but in a way because it said you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need to take all this money to</v>

1311
00:59:15.611 --> 00:59:18.190
<v Speaker 2>achieve the transaction to achieve the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end game,</v>

1312
00:59:18.191 --> 00:59:19.360
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1313
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:20.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1314
00:59:20.321 --> 00:59:20.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1315
00:59:20.621 --> 00:59:22.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of alternative currencies </v>
<v Speaker 2>in general.</v>

1316
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:25.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's going to be bitcoin</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something else.</v>

1317
00:59:25.581 --> 00:59:29.550
<v Speaker 2>We're probably at a super early point </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now with it and it's,</v>

1318
00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:30.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be,</v>

1319
00:59:30.610 --> 00:59:35.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard at any time when you're </v>

1320
00:59:35.610 --> 00:59:35.660
<v Speaker 2>looking at something in its earliest </v>
<v Speaker 2>form to see the end game to see where it</v>

1321
00:59:35.661 --> 00:59:37.220
<v Speaker 2>ends up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1322
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:38.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the first,</v>

1323
00:59:38.661 --> 00:59:43.661
<v Speaker 2>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the first iphone jumped on the </v>

1324
00:59:43.661 --> 00:59:43.730
<v Speaker 2>scene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget that moment you before</v>

1325
00:59:43.731 --> 00:59:46.190
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the devices before that and after that,</v>

1326
00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:51.220
<v Speaker 2>how much they changed in an instant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I feel like once when there's </v>

1327
00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:55.661
<v Speaker 2>some big dynamic moment that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>bitcoin is able to achieve or </v>

1328
00:59:55.661 --> 00:59:59.201
<v Speaker 2>alternative currencies are able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve some really cool feature where </v>

1329
00:59:59.201 --> 01:00:02.381
<v Speaker 2>we can tap watches and spend money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we never have to pull anything out of </v>

1330
01:00:02.381 --> 01:00:02.510
<v Speaker 2>our pocket like the starbucks APP.</v>

1331
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:04.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm using that shit all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>

1332
01:00:04.811 --> 01:00:09.811
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it one of those things that pull you </v>

1333
01:00:09.811 --> 01:00:09.811
<v Speaker 2>scan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

1334
01:00:09.811 --> 01:00:11.480
<v Speaker 2>So what it is is like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to,</v>

1335
01:00:11.481 --> 01:00:15.050
<v Speaker 2>but you put in your favorite locations </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when it sends its proximity nearby,</v>

1336
01:00:15.051 --> 01:00:18.080
<v Speaker 2>you just swipe over and as a barcode and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done or you could just shake it.</v>

1337
01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:20.840
<v Speaker 2>Now the new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the latest one you can shake and it just</v>

1338
01:00:20.841 --> 01:00:22.650
<v Speaker 2>brings up your payment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1339
01:00:22.850 --> 01:00:24.240
<v Speaker 2>it collects your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1340
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:28.240
<v Speaker 2>every 10 times you get a free drink </v>
<v Speaker 2>loyalty programs and then also gives you</v>

1341
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:31.700
<v Speaker 2>free music and free apps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that starbucks did their APP,</v>

1342
01:00:31.701 --> 01:00:32.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1343
01:00:32.391 --> 01:00:35.370
<v Speaker 2>the starbucks happens every 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a free one every time.</v>

1344
01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:36.870
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1345
01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.870
<v Speaker 2>that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Automatically uploads.</v>

1346
01:00:38.871 --> 01:00:40.480
<v Speaker 2>So like you'll always have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1347
01:00:40.570 --> 01:00:45.570
<v Speaker 2>the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing is like in the past I've been </v>

1348
01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:45.890
<v Speaker 2>so reluctant to do rewards programs like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1349
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:50.890
<v Speaker 2>So bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're at a department store and it's </v>

1350
01:00:50.890 --> 01:00:51.240
<v Speaker 2>like every thousand dollars you get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>earn a dollar.</v>

1351
01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:52.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like Oh fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

1352
01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:55.440
<v Speaker 2>But this one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1353
01:00:55.450 --> 01:01:00.450
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they made it in such a way that it's a </v>

1354
01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:00.450
<v Speaker 2>more convenient purchasing process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

1355
01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:04.840
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take the loyalty on the side to </v>

1356
01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:04.840
<v Speaker 2>side deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not,</v>

1357
01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.020
<v Speaker 2>that's a cool way of looking at it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's nice that they did that.</v>

1358
01:01:06.021 --> 01:01:07.820
<v Speaker 2>That's so clever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And 10 to one,</v>

1359
01:01:07.821 --> 01:01:11.480
<v Speaker 2>it's like a really good ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like by 10 drinks you get one free.</v>

1360
01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.020
<v Speaker 2>That's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really is it 10,</v>

1361
01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:16.910
<v Speaker 2>10.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you get to get whatever you want.</v>

1362
01:01:16.911 --> 01:01:19.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's when you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have seven shots.</v>

1363
01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Chocolate by throwing and I know it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not even a commensurate drank so he </v>

1364
01:01:26.421 --> 01:01:29.990
<v Speaker 2>could buy like five shots of Espresso </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've done it before.</v>

1365
01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.280
<v Speaker 2>You can get a super drink and they give </v>
<v Speaker 2>you one on your birthday as well to give</v>

1366
01:01:34.281 --> 01:01:34.660
<v Speaker 2>you a.</v>

1367
01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:36.100
<v Speaker 2>because of the APP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the APP,</v>

1368
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:41.110
<v Speaker 2>just tell them they go get a free drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you're at the store you hit the </v>

1369
01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:44.420
<v Speaker 2>APP and then just shake it and then it </v>
<v Speaker 2>pays for the world's getting ridiculous.</v>

1370
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:47.780
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about Google glass?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

1371
01:01:47.781 --> 01:01:52.781
<v Speaker 2>that's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing to talk about </v>

1372
01:01:52.781 --> 01:01:52.781
<v Speaker 2>because I feel like these are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interim glass.</v>

1373
01:01:52.781 --> 01:01:57.040
<v Speaker 2>These watches interim that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get you to a glass one day glasses.</v>

1374
01:01:57.050 --> 01:02:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Nowhere near ready for mass mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumption it.</v>

1375
01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.040
<v Speaker 2>Well it's $1,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1376
01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which to some people might see,</v>

1377
01:02:06.810 --> 01:02:09.110
<v Speaker 2>might not seem like a huge hurdle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's gigantic.</v>

1378
01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:14.350
<v Speaker 2>And second of all it's obtrusive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just got back from San Francisco </v>

1379
01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:14.740
<v Speaker 2>where there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1380
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:19.780
<v Speaker 2>glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a huge percentage of people </v>

1381
01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:22.931
<v Speaker 2>wearing glass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't someone get in trouble for </v>

1382
01:02:22.931 --> 01:02:22.931
<v Speaker 2>driving with</v>

1383
01:02:22.931 --> 01:02:22.931
<v Speaker 3>them on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't hear that story,</v>

1384
01:02:22.931 --> 01:02:24.870
<v Speaker 3>but I think they could imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they had to drop the case.</v>

1385
01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:26.430
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the thing the guy got in trouble for</v>

1386
01:02:26.431 --> 01:02:29.490
<v Speaker 3>driving with the mom because they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that he was using was driving.</v>

1387
01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:34.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure that's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know some bars have outlawed them </v>

1388
01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:34.620
<v Speaker 3>should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1389
01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:38.550
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have those weird cameras you can </v>

1390
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:41.061
<v Speaker 3>buy that look like buttons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have those and they'll also have </v>

1391
01:02:41.061 --> 01:02:41.190
<v Speaker 3>stan hope used.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stan hope had a,</v>

1392
01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:46.191
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a hidden camera show for awhile and he </v>

1393
01:02:46.191 --> 01:02:46.191
<v Speaker 3>had glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was a long fucking time ago.</v>

1394
01:02:46.191 --> 01:02:46.600
<v Speaker 3>Camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>

1395
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:49.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say this isn't the nineties.</v>

1396
01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:54.560
<v Speaker 3>Might've been the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doug had a really funny fucking like </v>

1397
01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:55.920
<v Speaker 3>hidden camera show and one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did is he had these glasses and there</v>

1398
01:02:55.950 --> 01:02:59.130
<v Speaker 3>just like this little center thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't tell.</v>

1399
01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:00.540
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely the.</v>

1400
01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:02.880
<v Speaker 3>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That already exists.</v>

1401
01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:03.660
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1402
01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:05.070
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1403
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the case of glass I don't.</v>

1404
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.200
<v Speaker 3>There's this really weird experience if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1405
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:12.420
<v Speaker 3>if you own it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't really wear it.</v>

1406
01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:16.200
<v Speaker 3>If you go out wearing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people have no problem doing it,</v>

1407
01:03:16.201 --> 01:03:21.201
<v Speaker 3>but it becomes the whole event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wants to ask about it or try.</v>

1408
01:03:21.511 --> 01:03:23.300
<v Speaker 3>It may not nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not so much anymore,</v>

1409
01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:26.730
<v Speaker 3>but it's just not a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something wrong with it.</v>

1410
01:03:26.731 --> 01:03:28.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it's hard to pinpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1411
01:03:28.861 --> 01:03:30.930
<v Speaker 3>But if I came in here wearing glass </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately,</v>

1412
01:03:30.931 --> 01:03:35.931
<v Speaker 3>you would go work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would have a different perception of </v>

1413
01:03:35.931 --> 01:03:35.931
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1414
01:03:35.931 --> 01:03:38.310
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think we're ready to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of a statement.</v>

1415
01:03:38.340 --> 01:03:40.110
<v Speaker 3>I think it's going to have to look up </v>
<v Speaker 3>your glasses.</v>

1416
01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:40.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll have.</v>

1417
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.460
<v Speaker 3>It'll have to be regular glasses and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

1418
01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:44.640
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1419
01:03:44.641 --> 01:03:47.190
<v Speaker 3>as things get smaller and smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shouldn't be prohibitive.</v>

1420
01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the,</v>

1421
01:03:48.421 --> 01:03:51.360
<v Speaker 3>the lenses themselves though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bars on the side of the lenses.</v>

1422
01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:54.180
<v Speaker 3>Just some sort of like right now it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little oversized.</v>

1423
01:03:54.181 --> 01:03:55.390
<v Speaker 3>And you swipe it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1424
01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:56.550
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've done it.</v>

1425
01:03:56.590 --> 01:03:57.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like it.</v>

1426
01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:58.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1427
01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:58.450
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1428
01:03:58.451 --> 01:04:03.451
<v Speaker 3>it felt silly to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want this thing in front of my </v>

1429
01:04:03.451 --> 01:04:03.451
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1430
01:04:03.451 --> 01:04:06.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's this prism and I actually </v>

1431
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:06.420
<v Speaker 3>got the version,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wear sunglasses all the time.</v>

1432
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:11.070
<v Speaker 3>So if I went out and I had no navigation</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my car,</v>

1433
01:04:11.071 --> 01:04:14.160
<v Speaker 3>I just slap these bitches on and I see </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything that's coming at me.</v>

1434
01:04:14.161 --> 01:04:17.670
<v Speaker 3>I see the weather up here for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that would be the shit.</v>

1435
01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.590
<v Speaker 3>Why haven't they done this shit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't.</v>

1436
01:04:19.591 --> 01:04:24.591
<v Speaker 3>They just created some dope ass Oakley </v>
<v Speaker 3>style sunglasses that have a fucking </v>

1437
01:04:24.591 --> 01:04:24.900
<v Speaker 3>screen in it.</v>

1438
01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:29.900
<v Speaker 3>Like your goddamn movie theater and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>driving around and all my information </v>

1439
01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.530
<v Speaker 3>you're done with your girlfriends is </v>
<v Speaker 3>right over here.</v>

1440
01:04:31.590 --> 01:04:33.540
<v Speaker 3>That's what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what every year at target.</v>

1441
01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:39.020
<v Speaker 3>I think what it's going to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all gonna have our own google </v>

1442
01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:41.721
<v Speaker 3>glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's also going to have something </v>

1443
01:04:41.721 --> 01:04:41.721
<v Speaker 3>that broadcast is our Avatar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not going to.</v>

1444
01:04:41.721 --> 01:04:43.850
<v Speaker 3>We're going to feel comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You recording me because you're acting.</v>

1445
01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:47.280
<v Speaker 3>My face is going to be replaced with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cat face and my voice has to be replaced</v>

1446
01:04:47.281 --> 01:04:49.430
<v Speaker 3>with something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just your retarded world.</v>

1447
01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.250
<v Speaker 3>No one's buying it the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some ways there's like a,</v>

1448
01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:55.380
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a race between,</v>

1449
01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:59.560
<v Speaker 3>between a glass and other forms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>augmented reality to like,</v>

1450
01:04:59.561 --> 01:05:01.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this thing I brought over here,</v>

1451
01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:06.530
<v Speaker 3>this little piece of cardboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but ultimately isn't like glasses the </v>

1452
01:05:06.530 --> 01:05:09.210
<v Speaker 3>most convenient to have more common </v>
<v Speaker 3>because people have all the time anyway.</v>

1453
01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely.</v>

1454
01:05:10.111 --> 01:05:10.680
<v Speaker 3>What is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian?</v>

1455
01:05:10.681 --> 01:05:12.750
<v Speaker 3>What do you got here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is Oakley airwaves,</v>

1456
01:05:12.751 --> 01:05:14.670
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of like their version of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1457
01:05:14.671 --> 01:05:16.930
<v Speaker 3>I dunno like a google glass where it </v>
<v Speaker 3>has.</v>

1458
01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:18.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like</v>

1459
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:23.160
<v Speaker 2>a ski goggles to drive around with </v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the privacy.</v>

1462
01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:30.970
<v Speaker 2>A face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was kind of pulled up.</v>

1463
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:33.370
<v Speaker 2>That it has navigation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The fuck can't play that shit.</v>

1467
01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:45.061
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the craziest thing I've ever </v>

1468
01:05:45.061 --> 01:05:45.061
<v Speaker 2>heard in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we can get this to work,</v>

1469
01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.550

<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even want to give it the </v>

1518
01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:47.580
<v Speaker 2>exposure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>give him some exposure.</v>

1521
01:07:54.690 --> 01:07:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Some guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate doing this though.</v>

1522
01:07:56.791 --> 01:07:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Some guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the dream.</v>

<v Speaker 2>One guy had,</v>

1525
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:08.130
<v Speaker 2>this was back in the day and when a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people were into like,</v>

1526
01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.760
<v Speaker 2>like little docking stands for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>phones and shit like that.</v>

1527
01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:17.120
<v Speaker 2>And some guy had one kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially glued onto your phone like </v>

1528
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 2>this sloppy material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I regretted it immediately.</v>

1529
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:23.960
<v Speaker 2>I was upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's an example.</v>

1530

<v Speaker 2>So you put it on your phone?</v>

01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:50.480
<v Speaker 2>really come because the controllers are </v>
<v Speaker 2>not very durable.</v>

1542
01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:54.580
<v Speaker 2>I had within,</v>
<v Speaker 2>within a few weeks I had the,</v>

1543
01:08:54.581 --> 01:08:59.581
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rubber from the thumb sticks </v>

1544
01:08:59.581 --> 01:08:59.581
<v Speaker 2>starting to degenerate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I posted a video.</v>

1545
01:08:59.581 --> 01:09:01.340
<v Speaker 2>It has almost a million views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>

1546
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:04.220
<v Speaker 2>I tell you when I'm sick of Berenger </v>
<v Speaker 2>mixers,</v>

1547
01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:10.090
<v Speaker 2>I found out that Berenger as a company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always used [inaudible] because I </v>

1548
01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:11.080
<v Speaker 2>always go to the budget and budget </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1549
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:15.390
<v Speaker 2>German brands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was created Germany,</v>

1550
01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:16.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or something like that.</v>

1551
01:09:16.101 --> 01:09:19.090
<v Speaker 2>I think they just use a German.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hilarious.</v>

1552
01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Brian's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His research pro.</v>

1553
01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:22.280
<v Speaker 2>You always use German.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

1554
01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:24.500

<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's that.</v>

1555
01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:26.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it's not German.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's been.</v>

1556
01:09:26.021 --> 01:09:31.021
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually it was just the first mixer </v>

1557
01:09:31.021 --> 01:09:31.021

<v Speaker 2>but I had to.</v>

1559
01:09:31.021 --> 01:09:35.300
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had to replace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've spent more on mixers in the </v>

1560
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:35.420
<v Speaker 2>last five years and then I researched </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1561
01:09:35.650 --> 01:09:36.560
<v Speaker 2>Podcast mics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stairs.</v>

1562
01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:39.260
<v Speaker 2>I just had to replace my third one and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this time I went with the Yamaha,</v>

1563
01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:40.890
<v Speaker 2>just whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1564
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:46.030

<v Speaker 2>like in the past they've had lawsuits </v>

1565
01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:49.660
<v Speaker 2>and stuff are pretty much they just take</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good concert and just copy it was </v>

<v Speaker 2>shitty parts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the first version of like when you </v>

1568
01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:56.420
<v Speaker 2>it's the exact same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I,</v>

1569
01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:58.220
<v Speaker 2>I went to guitar center the other day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>this and I just now found out after </v>

1572
01:10:04.090 --> 01:10:07.450
<v Speaker 2>spending so much money on Berenger and </v>
<v Speaker 2>having so much shit fry out.</v>

1573
01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:10.100
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to do so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yamaha is a good move though,</v>

1574
01:10:10.101 --> 01:10:11.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Omaha is pretty good.</v>

1575
01:10:11.151 --> 01:10:13.160
<v Speaker 2>There's something with an m I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember.</v>

1576
01:10:13.161 --> 01:10:18.161
<v Speaker 2>Like Moki Makie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makie supposedly is what everyone else </v>

1577
01:10:18.161 --> 01:10:18.161
<v Speaker 2>loves.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

1580
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:21.320
<v Speaker 2>This is a parent in church and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>headphone,</v>

1581
01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.620
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1582
01:10:24.710 --> 01:10:26.710
<v Speaker 2>I've replaced three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1583
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:29.780
<v Speaker 2>like 400,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$500 mixers in the last two years.</v>

1584
01:10:29.781 --> 01:10:34.781
<v Speaker 2>Three years down the headphone Jack just</v>
<v Speaker 2>went out like the yesterday or second </v>

1585
01:10:34.781 --> 01:10:36.500
<v Speaker 2>headphone Jack headphone jacks went out </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

1586
01:10:36.501 --> 01:10:38.720
<v Speaker 2>They all fucking suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

1587
01:10:39.150 --> 01:10:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Not a candidate even leaving these mics </v>
<v Speaker 2>are the shit.</v>

1588
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:45.050
<v Speaker 2>I just want to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the statements.</v>

1589
01:10:45.051 --> 01:10:50.051
<v Speaker 2>You just heard the opinion only that of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian's my opinion do not represent the </v>

1590
01:10:50.051 --> 01:10:51.700
<v Speaker 2>rest of this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in Gen,</v>

1591
01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:53.990
<v Speaker 2>in general though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>products have gotten a lot better.</v>

1592
01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:56.780
<v Speaker 2>They have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've gotten just like market wide.</v>

1593
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:58.750
<v Speaker 2>You can't get away with a nod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

1594
01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:01.880
<v Speaker 2>It's this too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too much pr now.</v>

1595
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Total exposure exposure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's one thing I fucking love.</v>

1596
01:11:07.371 --> 01:11:12.371
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons why I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>have you on is the kind of videos that </v>

1597
01:11:12.371 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 2>you do and there's a lot of other that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are doing them now.</v>

1598
01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:17.640
<v Speaker 3>There's so comprehensive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would have never existed on a network</v>

1599
01:11:17.641 --> 01:11:20.070
<v Speaker 3>television show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like even like the,</v>

1600
01:11:20.071 --> 01:11:22.290
<v Speaker 3>like when you used to have the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>tech tv days,</v>

1601
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:24.580
<v Speaker 3>which was excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the screensavers.</v>

1602
01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:29.660
<v Speaker 3>I love that they didn't have the time to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do what you're doing and specific to </v>

1603
01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:31.590
<v Speaker 3>that device.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to worry about,</v>

1604
01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:32.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1605
01:11:32.671 --> 01:11:35.610
<v Speaker 3>I have to be off the air in six minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when the commercial goes.</v>

1606
01:11:35.611 --> 01:11:37.230
<v Speaker 3>We have to go to break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no break.</v>

1607
01:11:37.231 --> 01:11:39.330
<v Speaker 3>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that stuff is dog shit.</v>

1608
01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:41.470
<v Speaker 3>That's a dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With that silent movies,</v>

1609
01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:46.950
<v Speaker 3>you're doing a puppet show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might as well be shown this was a </v>

1610
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.950
<v Speaker 3>real monster girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1611
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:47.520
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1612
01:11:47.521 --> 01:11:49.590
<v Speaker 3>You can't use the rubber claymation </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

1613
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:54.120
<v Speaker 3>It's 2014 and you can't keep reviewing </v>
<v Speaker 3>tech items on television.</v>

1614
01:11:54.121 --> 01:11:59.121
<v Speaker 3>So essentially what's going on as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet has created a platform for you </v>

1615
01:11:59.121 --> 01:12:01.560
<v Speaker 3>guys to completely change the technology</v>
<v Speaker 3>review market.</v>

1616
01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:03.300
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And make it super interactive.</v>

1617
01:12:03.301 --> 01:12:08.301
<v Speaker 3>Like say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're thinking about getting a new </v>

1618
01:12:08.301 --> 01:12:08.301
<v Speaker 3>iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go online,</v>

1619
01:12:08.301 --> 01:12:08.301
<v Speaker 3>go to cnet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to your site,</v>

1620
01:12:08.301 --> 01:12:13.191
<v Speaker 3>go to all these different sites and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll just hit review after review </v>

1621
01:12:13.191 --> 01:12:16.341
<v Speaker 3>after review informed detailed in depth </v>
<v Speaker 3>reviews that many times the guy will </v>

1622
01:12:16.341 --> 01:12:21.231
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had this phone for the past five </v>

1623
01:12:21.231 --> 01:12:21.231
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking with it.</v>

1624
01:12:21.231 --> 01:12:22.150
<v Speaker 3>Here are my thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just not gonna.</v>

1625
01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:23.710
<v Speaker 3>Get that anywhere else?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1626
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:27.900
<v Speaker 3>it's the platform.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The platform has enabled that to happen.</v>

1627
01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:31.050
<v Speaker 3>Like like it's enabled so many new forms</v>
<v Speaker 3>of entertainment to happen.</v>

1628
01:12:31.051 --> 01:12:32.940
<v Speaker 3>Like this podcast is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

1629
01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:36.360
<v Speaker 3>if somebody would have given us a show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not a fucking chance in hell,</v>

1630
01:12:36.370 --> 01:12:38.610
<v Speaker 3>a radio show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now bringing this guy with me.</v>

1631
01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:39.770
<v Speaker 3>We're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1632
01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.230
<v Speaker 3>He started shit because it's kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cute because of the.</v>

1633
01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:44.700
<v Speaker 3>Because of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the way you said that,</v>

1634
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:46.860
<v Speaker 3>like in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>old media,</v>

1635
01:12:46.861 --> 01:12:48.330
<v Speaker 3>somebody had to give you something.</v>

1636
01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:51.150
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now you go out and get it.</v>

1637
01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the old days someone had to hire you for</v>

1638
01:12:53.761 --> 01:12:54.590
<v Speaker 3>a show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I mean.</v>

1639
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:57.830
<v Speaker 3>There's no way you had to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a predetermined time slot,</v>

1640
01:12:57.831 --> 01:13:02.831
<v Speaker 3>like if you had a radio station,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all you have on that radio station is </v>

1641
01:13:02.831 --> 01:13:05.370
<v Speaker 3>the times that you're broadcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could simultaneously broadcast.</v>

1642
01:13:05.371 --> 01:13:08.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean we could if we wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian and I got together and said,</v>

1643
01:13:08.101 --> 01:13:10.400
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's start a fucking podcast empire.</v>

1644
01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:13.320
<v Speaker 3>Let's right everybody that we can </v>
<v Speaker 3>contact online,</v>

1645
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:16.200
<v Speaker 3>have those centers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We could start hiring people before,</v>

1646
01:13:16.201 --> 01:13:21.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get up 50 podcast going on at the </v>

1647
01:13:21.201 --> 01:13:21.600
<v Speaker 3>same time just dumping them out into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet.</v>

1648
01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:24.870
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to have a 24 hour time </v>
<v Speaker 3>period where you know,</v>

1649
01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.210
<v Speaker 3>frosty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heidi and frank are from eight to 10 and</v>

1650
01:13:27.211 --> 01:13:29.760
<v Speaker 3>then after that it's fucking conway and </v>
<v Speaker 3>steckler.</v>

1651
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:31.290
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to have that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1652
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:36.390
<v Speaker 3>And brings it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brings up a lot of deficiencies in the </v>

1653
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.790
<v Speaker 3>traditional media model that now that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is same,</v>

1654
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.920
<v Speaker 3>everything is essentially on demand and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1655
01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:45.150
<v Speaker 3>it honestly feels strange for me to plan</v>
<v Speaker 3>my day around a live event and about </v>

1656
01:13:45.150 --> 01:13:47.490
<v Speaker 3>watching commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you want to fucking throw up in your</v>

1657
01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:50.280
<v Speaker 3>pants like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you showing me?</v>

1658
01:13:50.281 --> 01:13:53.210
<v Speaker 3>Why is the program stopped vs Horse </v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit?</v>

1659
01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:58.250
<v Speaker 3>To be honest with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>commercials don't need to be as bad as </v>

1660
01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:58.470
<v Speaker 3>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now Look at Art Formula Joe.</v>

1661
01:13:58.471 --> 01:14:03.471
<v Speaker 3>Now we might do it a little long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what if we were advertising Coca </v>

1662
01:14:03.471 --> 01:14:04.140
<v Speaker 3>Cola in 30 seconds so we can do whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck we want.</v>

1663
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:06.750
<v Speaker 3>I would watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing,</v>

1664
01:14:06.751 --> 01:14:11.751
<v Speaker 3>like when the super bowl happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone has come to replenish glycogen </v>

1665
01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 3>corn</v>

1666
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:17.100
<v Speaker 5>syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you put a frog inside that can of </v>

1667
01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:17.170
<v Speaker 5>cook for two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>coke bad for you.</v>

1668
01:14:17.171 --> 01:14:18.130
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's bad.</v>

1669
01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:23.660
<v Speaker 5>I was living in a city you fuck face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How about coconut smile and shut the </v>

1670
01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:24.850
<v Speaker 5>fuck up pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's old school.</v>

1671
01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:26.410
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1672
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:32.070
<v Speaker 5>but they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only reason why that works is </v>

1673
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:32.440
<v Speaker 5>because that forced that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they're constantly trying to get me</v>

1674
01:14:32.441 --> 01:14:34.030
<v Speaker 5>to do ads in the middle of a podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1675
01:14:34.031 --> 01:14:39.031
<v Speaker 5>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Every new ad that's like one of the </v>

1676
01:14:39.031 --> 01:14:39.031
<v Speaker 5>first things that comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a debate.</v>

1677
01:14:39.031 --> 01:14:41.080
<v Speaker 5>It's like they want to interrupt the </v>
<v Speaker 5>show and insert ads.</v>

1678
01:14:41.730 --> 01:14:43.180
<v Speaker 5>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's not an option.</v>

1679
01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:46.720
<v Speaker 5>It's a super stupid crappy models and </v>
<v Speaker 5>work.</v>

1680
01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:48.430
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't and defensive.</v>

1681
01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:51.130
<v Speaker 5>It's a holdover.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a holdover from a time that doesn't</v>

1682
01:14:51.131 --> 01:14:52.000
<v Speaker 5>exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

1683
01:14:52.030 --> 01:14:57.030
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just take the platform that </v>

1684
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:58.351
<v Speaker 5>existed and and bolted onto this new </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing instead of developing something </v>

1685
01:14:58.351 --> 01:15:00.340
<v Speaker 5>from the ground up that fits with this </v>
<v Speaker 5>language.</v>

1686
01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:05.370
<v Speaker 5>This is a whole new language.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I even feel this way about indi </v>

1687
01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:07.330
<v Speaker 5>individual social networks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I feel like youtube has a language.</v>

1688
01:15:07.331 --> 01:15:09.370
<v Speaker 5>Facebook hasn't language.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Twitter has a language.</v>

1689
01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.060
<v Speaker 5>Instagram that sort of when you're a </v>
<v Speaker 5>content producer,</v>

1690
01:15:13.061 --> 01:15:18.061
<v Speaker 5>you sort of feel like all those places </v>
<v Speaker 5>at the same because you're broadcasting </v>

1691
01:15:18.061 --> 01:15:19.360
<v Speaker 5>to all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but ultimately more often than not,</v>

1692
01:15:19.361 --> 01:15:21.460
<v Speaker 5>those users,</v>
<v Speaker 5>our platform independent,</v>

1693
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:26.550
<v Speaker 5>they have a place where they like to get</v>
<v Speaker 5>at you more than one other place and </v>

1694
01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:30.361
<v Speaker 5>that becomes their habit and so since </v>
<v Speaker 5>their consumption model is unique,</v>

1695
01:15:30.490 --> 01:15:35.490
<v Speaker 5>so say your people who people who viewed</v>
<v Speaker 5>this podcast on youtube versus who </v>

1696
01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:39.310
<v Speaker 5>listened to the audio only versus who.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are all independent people,</v>

1697
01:15:39.311 --> 01:15:43.240
<v Speaker 5>all with their their own mindset and </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to.</v>

1698
01:15:43.690 --> 01:15:48.690
<v Speaker 5>Trying to figure out the right way of </v>
<v Speaker 5>interacting with all those groups is </v>

1699
01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:50.290
<v Speaker 5>something that big brands are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>do now through their,</v>

1700
01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:52.600
<v Speaker 5>their,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their social experiments and et cetera.</v>

1701
01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.620
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1702
01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.150
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when people come and talk to me,</v>

1703
01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:58.600
<v Speaker 5>brands or advertisers or whoever it </v>
<v Speaker 5>might be,</v>

1704
01:15:58.601 --> 01:15:59.380
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

1705
01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:03.640
<v Speaker 5>we need to build something from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ground up native to this platform.</v>

1706
01:16:03.940 --> 01:16:06.100
<v Speaker 5>Don't bring me something from somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 5>else.</v>

1707
01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:10.350
<v Speaker 5>This is not a national ad campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is 850,000</v>

1708
01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:15.360
<v Speaker 5>very sophisticated viewers with a super </v>
<v Speaker 5>high sensitivity to bullshit,</v>

1709
01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:21.570
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because they're not used to getting it </v>

1710
01:16:21.570 --> 01:16:21.570
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not getting any of it.</v>

1711
01:16:21.570 --> 01:16:22.780
<v Speaker 5>They're not getting any of it about your</v>
<v Speaker 5>own life.</v>

1712
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:28.470
<v Speaker 5>People who are hosting podcasts will </v>
<v Speaker 5>tell you the truth about their own </v>

1713
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.470
<v Speaker 5>personal fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1714
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:30.130
<v Speaker 5>And so that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a,</v>

1715
01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:32.980
<v Speaker 5>it's a really unique proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huge value,</v>

1716
01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:38.070
<v Speaker 5>huge value for a brand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In some ways I feel like this whole </v>

1717
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:40.600
<v Speaker 5>marketplace is heavily undervalued.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you compare a CPM figures like from</v>

1718
01:16:40.601 --> 01:16:42.280
<v Speaker 5>the traditional media world to this </v>
<v Speaker 5>world,</v>

1719
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:44.990
<v Speaker 5>these people are more fucking dedicated </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1720
01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:50.160
<v Speaker 5>They're loyal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know that you're kicking them the </v>

1721
01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:50.160
<v Speaker 5>real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Unbox therapy is not going to lie.</v>

1722
01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:55.110
<v Speaker 5>You're not allowing your deep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your eyes and you're also,</v>

1723
01:16:55.151 --> 01:17:00.151
<v Speaker 5>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're deep into discovering the flaws </v>

1724
01:17:00.151 --> 01:17:01.510
<v Speaker 5>which is actually essential to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>development process,</v>

1725
01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:06.670
<v Speaker 5>like for to ensure that you still have a</v>
<v Speaker 5>job and that these companies create an </v>

1726
01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:08.170
<v Speaker 5>innovative,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it might be painful for them.</v>

1727
01:17:08.171 --> 01:17:10.250
<v Speaker 5>They might not enjoy some of your </v>
<v Speaker 5>criticisms,</v>

1728
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:11.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's critical.</v>

1729
01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:14.330
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you an example right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please do live example,</v>

1730
01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:16.580
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Samsung.</v>

1731
01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Samsung keeps making these shitty ass </v>
<v Speaker 2>chargers.</v>

1732
01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:21.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1733
01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Look at this damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just the charger for their </v>

1734
01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:26.560
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a beautiful looking device,</v>

1735
01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the charger.</v>

1736
01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Installed the charger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1737
01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:29.630
<v Speaker 2>go for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

1738
01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.980
<v Speaker 2>You know who also done that in the past?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sony used to do that shit all the time.</v>

1739
01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:34.530
<v Speaker 2>If they're like Bluetooth headsets and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

1740
01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.870
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean proprietary stuff?</v>

1741
01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:37.790
<v Speaker 2>Well these are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are all going to be proposed.</v>

1742
01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:39.470
<v Speaker 2>That's what you gotta do every night </v>
<v Speaker 2>before bed.</v>

1743
01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:42.200
<v Speaker 2>You're not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had a few drinks.</v>

1744
01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why the new Apple Watch is going </v>

1745
01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:47.230
<v Speaker 2>to be a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm coordinators.</v>

1746
01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Fuck no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1747
01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:47.230
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1748
01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:48.080
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be on heroin.</v>

1749
01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you can't do it,</v>

1750
01:17:50.391 --> 01:17:52.220
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a pleasurable experience.</v>

1751
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:56.270
<v Speaker 2>You're so funny that you would like it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be just like a regular usb.</v>

1752
01:17:56.290 --> 01:17:58.760
<v Speaker 2>You remember what I said before about </v>
<v Speaker 2>opening up an apple laptop.</v>

1753
01:17:59.210 --> 01:18:02.060
<v Speaker 2>That breath of fresh air that you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1754
01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:07.840
<v Speaker 2>You can't measure it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just keeps you liking in using the </v>

1755
01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.140
<v Speaker 2>device is sort of like their keyboards </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the mice.</v>

1756
01:18:09.570 --> 01:18:12.350
<v Speaker 2>They're so clean and everything is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I want.</v>

1757
01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.510
<v Speaker 2>I just want to look at the damn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1758
01:18:14.511 --> 01:18:16.910
<v Speaker 2>If a beautiful thing will always be more</v>
<v Speaker 2>attractive.</v>

1759
01:18:16.911 --> 01:18:19.010
<v Speaker 2>I forgot the damn charger for the LG g </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch,</v>

1760
01:18:19.011 --> 01:18:21.440
<v Speaker 2>but no worries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lg on the other hand,</v>

1761
01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:24.970
<v Speaker 2>the entire back is a magnet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you do is you just drop it.</v>

1762
01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Lg Winds better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apple's new watch.</v>

1763
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:33.070
<v Speaker 2>You just lay it down on the of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the minute you laid down on the </v>

1764
01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:35.090
<v Speaker 2>counter that charger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

1765
01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:35.960
<v Speaker 2>How's that possible?</v>

1766
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey.</v>

1767
01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of you could do this right now.</v>

1768
01:18:38.841 --> 01:18:42.670
<v Speaker 2>You can go to best buy and buy these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that fit on the back of your mind</v>

1769
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:45.430
<v Speaker 2>and some phones you need to buy anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>is already ci enabled.</v>

1770
01:18:45.490 --> 01:18:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you could just lay down on the mat</v>

1771
01:18:47.571 --> 01:18:52.571
<v Speaker 2>and we'll show a map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A specific part thought you were saying </v>

1772
01:18:52.571 --> 01:18:56.231
<v Speaker 2>it charges in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like apple is a watch supposedly has </v>

1773
01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:56.990
<v Speaker 2>it where you could just lay it down on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1774
01:18:56.991 --> 01:18:57.710
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1775
01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:00.260
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you my one criticism of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mat.</v>

1776
01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:03.070
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that with the mat is </v>
<v Speaker 2>traveling,</v>

1777
01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:05.240
<v Speaker 2>traveling with a Goddamn Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1778
01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:07.490
<v Speaker 2>Unless it's becomes as big as the iphone</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then Hook,</v>

1779
01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.800
<v Speaker 2>just have that mat which is probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna have if,</v>

1780
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:11.660
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's gonna take awhile,</v>

1781
01:19:11.690 --> 01:19:16.580
<v Speaker 2>but starbucks actually are starting to </v>
<v Speaker 2>implement ci enabled surfaces so it will</v>

1782
01:19:16.581 --> 01:19:18.140
<v Speaker 2>happen but it's definitely not there </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

1783
01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:20.510
<v Speaker 2>And in the meantime the little charger </v>
<v Speaker 2>for this LG is,</v>

1784
01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:23.260
<v Speaker 2>it's super thin and it's about the size </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the watch and they,</v>

1785
01:19:23.261 --> 01:19:25.520
<v Speaker 2>they can connect if you put them </v>
<v Speaker 2>together in your bag.</v>

1786
01:19:25.521 --> 01:19:28.640
<v Speaker 2>So because it has a magnet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had to watch before this,</v>

1787
01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:30.570
<v Speaker 2>the galaxy gear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1788
01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:34.070
<v Speaker 2>This is the gear live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The naming conventions are terrible.</v>

1789
01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:36.230
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the hardest parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>job actually.</v>

1790
01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Just getting the names right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's better than like the old days </v>

1791
01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:41.440
<v Speaker 2>off model numbers like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1792
01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:41.440
<v Speaker 2>I guess so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1793
01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:45.470
<v Speaker 2>the galaxy gear had this wacky thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that strapped around the whole device.</v>

1794
01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.530
<v Speaker 2>It was shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it screwed up the experience for me.</v>

1795
01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:51.650
<v Speaker 2>And I think that ruined the device if </v>
<v Speaker 2>the UI.</v>

1796
01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:54.080
<v Speaker 2>So Ui doesn't end here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>User interface.</v>

1797
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1798
01:19:54.861 --> 01:19:55.670
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or,</v>

1799
01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:00.720
<v Speaker 2>or you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used going to fuck or user or user </v>

1800
01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:04.121
<v Speaker 2>experience in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people assume like if </v>

1801
01:20:04.121 --> 01:20:07.841
<v Speaker 2>you're a developer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're building it for this and that's </v>

1802
01:20:07.841 --> 01:20:07.841
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1803
01:20:07.841 --> 01:20:07.841
<v Speaker 2>this is Ui,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this aluminum or,</v>

1804
01:20:07.841 --> 01:20:12.141
<v Speaker 2>or you eat it's user experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole experience is encompassed in </v>

1805
01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:13.190
<v Speaker 2>the way you interact with the damn thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

1806
01:20:13.210 --> 01:20:18.210
<v Speaker 2>Selling a wine connoisseur who sound </v>
<v Speaker 2>like one of those dudes is really in a </v>

1807
01:20:18.210 --> 01:20:18.510
<v Speaker 2>certain grade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm getting fired up right now.</v>

1808
01:20:21.010 --> 01:20:25.830
<v Speaker 2>I like this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you 100 percent and I think</v>

1809
01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:28.350
<v Speaker 2>that also what were saying before is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your,</v>

1810
01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:29.790
<v Speaker 2>these criticisms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1811
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.000
<v Speaker 2>this very detailed review that you'll do</v>
<v Speaker 2>about these products is super critical,</v>

1812
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:38.280
<v Speaker 2>super critical for the development and </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be hiring you.</v>

1813
01:20:38.610 --> 01:20:43.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get lots of interesting to get offers </v>

1814
01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:43.610
<v Speaker 2>to join apple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell you.</v>

1815
01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:44.040
<v Speaker 2>Shut the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just come over here.</v>

1816
01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:45.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shut the fuck.</v>

1817
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:50.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure apple is not a huge fan of mine</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I did some leaking of different </v>

1818
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:51.530
<v Speaker 2>components.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How dare you do that?</v>

1819
01:20:51.570 --> 01:20:53.580
<v Speaker 2>You've got it offline from China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1820
01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:57.150
<v Speaker 2>It's on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's out there on the ocean.</v>

1821
01:20:57.550 --> 01:20:59.310
<v Speaker 2>So deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not a big fan of mine.</v>

1822
01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:00.960
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did their keynote.</v>

1823
01:21:01.330 --> 01:21:02.400
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had leaked,</v>

1824
01:21:02.401 --> 01:21:04.350
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the IPAD air chassis,</v>

1825
01:21:04.351 --> 01:21:08.340
<v Speaker 2>the entire body before it came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had the entire form factor,</v>

1826
01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:08.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1827
01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:10.620
<v Speaker 2>It was on Forbes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get mad at you.</v>

1828
01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:11.810
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't.</v>

1829
01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:16.820
<v Speaker 2>I never heard a word about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the keynote they addressed it </v>

1830
01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:17.790
<v Speaker 2>like the big keynote that everyone was </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching.</v>

1831
01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:20.040
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think you guys might be familiar with</v>

1832
01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:22.050
<v Speaker 2>this next device,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Tim Cook addressed it,</v>

1833
01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:27.140
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you feel like certain amount of </v>

1834
01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:27.140
<v Speaker 2>power on the radar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1835
01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:29.470
<v Speaker 2>did something he made?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1836
01:21:29.670 --> 01:21:34.670
<v Speaker 2>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really because I feel like </v>

1837
01:21:34.670 --> 01:21:34.670
<v Speaker 2>these things are going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to leak out regardless.</v>

1838
01:21:34.670 --> 01:21:35.970
<v Speaker 2>There's just because of guys like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like saying people,</v>

1839
01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:40.980
<v Speaker 2>it's almost going to murder someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless because of a murderer I </v>

1840
01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:40.980
<v Speaker 2>guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1841
01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:42.110
<v Speaker 2>I guess I guess you're right about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1842
01:21:42.111 --> 01:21:43.870
<v Speaker 2>I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1843
01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:45.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more interested in the demand </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

1844
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Like why do people care so much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another thing that shows about </v>

1845
01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:51.780
<v Speaker 2>how our attachment to these devices.</v>

1846
01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:55.470
<v Speaker 2>It's insane that I put out a video like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and he's like,</v>

1847
01:21:55.471 --> 01:22:00.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know 2 million views or it's on </v>

1848
01:22:00.471 --> 01:22:00.471
<v Speaker 2>Forbes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1849
01:22:00.471 --> 01:22:00.750
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was everywhere.</v>

1850
01:22:00.751 --> 01:22:03.600
<v Speaker 2>Like it was posted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I had to google notifications turned</v>

1851
01:22:03.601 --> 01:22:08.601
<v Speaker 2>on for whenever it was getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was getting a news notification every </v>

1852
01:22:08.601 --> 01:22:11.631
<v Speaker 2>time my name was being used and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>just going off like it was on all these </v>

1853
01:22:11.631 --> 01:22:13.450
<v Speaker 2>different sites that we're embedding my </v>
<v Speaker 2>video and they're uh,</v>

1854
01:22:13.730 --> 01:22:18.730
<v Speaker 2>they're doing it because investors want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make adjustments to their plans </v>

1855
01:22:19.770 --> 01:22:23.490
<v Speaker 2>preemptively based on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on what they like.</v>

1856
01:22:24.170 --> 01:22:25.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean not the review.</v>

1857
01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leak.</v>

1858
01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.640
<v Speaker 2>So they see the IPAD air chassis before </v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually comes out and you go home </v>

1859
01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:33.540
<v Speaker 2>and people going like that chassis or </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are going to buy that chess.</v>

1860
01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:35.730
<v Speaker 2>Do you review when there's a leak?</v>

1861
01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:37.920
<v Speaker 2>You give opinions on the leak?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1862
01:22:37.921 --> 01:22:39.750
<v Speaker 2>I can share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I compare it to the old one,</v>

1863
01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.690
<v Speaker 2>like I do physical dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pulled a measuring tape out.</v>

1864
01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:47.960
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever known of anyone that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>given some sort of review and it's </v>

1865
01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:51.861
<v Speaker 2>actually changed the final product </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they listened to what people </v>

1866
01:22:51.861 --> 01:22:53.260
<v Speaker 2>were saying about a leak product and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit the bricks.</v>

1867
01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:55.500
<v Speaker 2>It can be a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>

1868
01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:57.750
<v Speaker 2>Probably like on kickstarter or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

1869
01:22:58.230 --> 01:23:03.230
<v Speaker 2>but not in a big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't feel like they would ever let you </v>

1870
01:23:03.230 --> 01:23:03.230
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean,</v>

1871
01:23:03.230 --> 01:23:07.420
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think brands are definitely paying</v>

1872
01:23:07.421 --> 01:23:12.421
<v Speaker 2>attention to the chatter they need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the market research is going deep </v>

1873
01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:12.421
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1874
01:23:12.421 --> 01:23:16.951
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they invest way too much money in </v>

1875
01:23:16.951 --> 01:23:18.130
<v Speaker 2>creating these things to take a risk </v>
<v Speaker 2>that everyone's going to hate it.</v>

1876
01:23:18.131 --> 01:23:23.131
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a guy like you is a direct line to </v>

1877
01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:23.131
<v Speaker 2>that because.</v>

1878
01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:23.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1879
01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:25.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm tapped into the pipeline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing this all day long.</v>

1880
01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Access to the vein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1881
01:23:26.261 --> 01:23:27.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is my thing.</v>

1882
01:23:27.790 --> 01:23:30.240
<v Speaker 2>When I used to do cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>

1883
01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.920
<v Speaker 2>when those little baby video cameras </v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be,</v>

1884
01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:35.250
<v Speaker 2>became really popular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever those were called.</v>

1885
01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:40.260
<v Speaker 2>Remember used to have a couple of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>are hd ones with the SD cards and a </v>

1886
01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Kodak had one and I did a really bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>review on one of codex,</v>

1887
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:48.800
<v Speaker 2>a little exactly what you're telling me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was because of low,</v>

1888
01:23:48.801 --> 01:23:53.801
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went during low lighting and stuff like </v>

1889
01:23:53.801 --> 01:23:53.801
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had a bunch of fucked up problems.</v>

1890
01:23:53.801 --> 01:23:55.420
<v Speaker 2>Kodak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kodak contact me and they actually did a</v>

1891
01:23:55.421 --> 01:23:58.780
<v Speaker 2>firmware upgrade based on just wondering</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's an example.</v>

1892
01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.270
<v Speaker 2>That's tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1893
01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1894
01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:03.910
<v Speaker 2>that's a super valuable resource for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>

1895
01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:07.270
<v Speaker 2>Definitely they're not going to get that</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of objectivity from the people that</v>

1896
01:24:07.271 --> 01:24:10.720
<v Speaker 2>work there and it was also a hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 2>with managers and people that work under</v>

1897
01:24:10.721 --> 01:24:15.721
<v Speaker 2>the managers and maybe the managers a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dick and he doesn't want to listen to </v>

1898
01:24:15.721 --> 01:24:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Mike's Advice and Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know Mike is kind of soft spoken,</v>

1899
01:24:16.241 --> 01:24:17.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's got really good ideas.</v>

1900
01:24:17.710 --> 01:24:22.710
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that social shit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes on to incorporate something that </v>

1901
01:24:22.710 --> 01:24:25.000
<v Speaker 2>doesn't get talked about is the is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural aspect,</v>

1902
01:24:25.050 --> 01:24:28.060
<v Speaker 2>like the vast majority of this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from halfway across the world.</v>

1903
01:24:28.061 --> 01:24:28.990
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know that.</v>

1904
01:24:31.090 --> 01:24:36.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what I can say on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are you withholding information </v>

1905
01:24:36.090 --> 01:24:36.560
<v Speaker 2>information?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just.</v>

1906
01:24:36.990 --> 01:24:38.800
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't want to burden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>

1907
01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to just try a way to name </v>

1908
01:24:44.250 --> 01:24:45.790
<v Speaker 2>any brands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some rhymes at ams young.</v>

1909
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:51.940
<v Speaker 2>Some are completely out of touch with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way life works over here.</v>

1910
01:24:52.150 --> 01:24:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In America,</v>

1911
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:59.070
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense and it shines through </v>

1912
01:24:59.070 --> 01:25:03.031
<v Speaker 2>and certain decision making when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes not only to products but to the </v>

1913
01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:06.601
<v Speaker 2>way they market those products to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way they communicate with press or the </v>

1914
01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:07.480
<v Speaker 2>way they communicate with their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1915
01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:09.110
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1916
01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:14.120
<v Speaker 2>I've been in some certain circumstances </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's been very foreign that makes </v>

1917
01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:18.310
<v Speaker 2>a tremendous amount of sap and seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1918
01:25:18.610 --> 01:25:23.610
<v Speaker 2>of course it seems obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everyone wants to pretend that a </v>

1919
01:25:23.650 --> 01:25:27.460
<v Speaker 2>user experience and in Asia is the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that we're going to want here.</v>

1920
01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how many.</v>

1921

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:26.760
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the R and d that goes into that </v>

1947
01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:26.760
<v Speaker 2>software.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Extensive,</v>

1948
01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:28.700
<v Speaker 2>so much money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many smart people,</v>

1949
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:30.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does Samsung do?</v>

1950
01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:32.960
<v Speaker 2>Three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they overhauled a motherfucker.</v>

1951
01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.110
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you going to take something that</v>

1952
01:26:36.111 --> 01:26:41.111
<v Speaker 2>took that long to develop and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to skin it and you're going to </v>

1953
01:26:41.111 --> 01:26:42.590
<v Speaker 2>change everything about it is three </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks while no,</v>

1954
01:26:42.650 --> 01:26:43.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm exaggerating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1955
01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:47.090
<v Speaker 2>if you pick up a samsung device,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same as an LG device.</v>

1956
01:26:47.091 --> 01:26:48.890
<v Speaker 2>Not the same as a Motorola device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same.</v>

1957
01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:52.080
<v Speaker 2>There's this fragmentation and that's in</v>
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

1958
01:26:52.090 --> 01:26:54.350
<v Speaker 2>because in the tech space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called the f word by the way,</v>

1959
01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.000
<v Speaker 2>fragmented for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they call it the f word.</v>

1960
01:26:56.001 --> 01:27:00.350
<v Speaker 2>It's a big deal because they decide to </v>
<v Speaker 2>add their own user interface.</v>

1961
01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:05.380
<v Speaker 2>They're old shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Samsung has their own thing that they </v>

1962
01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:05.380
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it called?</v>

1963
01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:08.270
<v Speaker 2>Samsung is called Touchwiz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1964
01:27:08.271 --> 01:27:10.340
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not touching my dick.</v>

1965
01:27:11.330 --> 01:27:13.490
<v Speaker 2>That's what I hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you have.</v>

1966
01:27:13.570 --> 01:27:14.980
<v Speaker 2>You have the ring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1967
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:17.080
<v Speaker 2>So that's the original operating system </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything.</v>

1968
01:27:17.110 --> 01:27:19.100
<v Speaker 2>Do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it night and day difference?</v>

1969
01:27:19.110 --> 01:27:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Because I've always used I guess a skin </v>
<v Speaker 2>version.</v>

1970
01:27:22.050 --> 01:27:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Balls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You San Francisco Mall.</v>

1971
01:27:23.690 --> 01:27:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Fuck all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got his hardcore dude.</v>

1972
01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.760
<v Speaker 2>He's super hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like Antonopoulos.</v>

1973
01:27:28.761 --> 01:27:31.010
<v Speaker 2>Remember Antonopoulos that he breaks </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything down.</v>

1974
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:32.840
<v Speaker 2>Roots it and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing.</v>

1975
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:37.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like I just really believe in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence level of the original </v>

1976
01:27:38.241 --> 01:27:43.241
<v Speaker 2>developers and I can't imagine how they </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep at night knowing that most </v>

1977
01:27:43.241 --> 01:27:45.260
<v Speaker 2>people's interpretation of android is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>galaxy device.</v>

1978
01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:48.240
<v Speaker 2>Get one of these next disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like smashed.</v>

1979
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:53.290
<v Speaker 2>You're sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is their art form and they're </v>

1980
01:27:53.290 --> 01:27:55.751
<v Speaker 2>sitting there putting all of this energy</v>
<v Speaker 2>into simple decisions like the shape of </v>

1981
01:27:55.751 --> 01:27:55.751
<v Speaker 2>an icon.</v>

1982
01:27:55.751 --> 01:27:58.250
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Design and then someone goes and goes,</v>

1983
01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.530
<v Speaker 2>I will build a better gun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be happy face.</v>

1984
01:28:00.710 --> 01:28:03.920
<v Speaker 2>No big deal is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

1985
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:09.070
<v Speaker 2>It would be like you'd get some </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful painting and you send it half </v>

1986
01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:09.410
<v Speaker 2>way across the world to Asia and tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1987
01:28:10.090 --> 01:28:12.120
<v Speaker 2>do what you want with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1988
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:14.030
<v Speaker 2>We never do that with any other kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>art.</v>

1989
01:28:14.300 --> 01:28:15.770
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

1990
01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:18.530
<v Speaker 2>you're accepting it as an art form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you're right,</v>

1991
01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:20.780
<v Speaker 2>it's created some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Creates it.</v>

1992
01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Someone draws the whole thing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1993
01:28:22.561 --> 01:28:23.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the,</v>

1994
01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:28.300
<v Speaker 2>this uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy behind this isn't Mathias </v>

1995
01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:28.300
<v Speaker 2>Duarte.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was at Google Io.</v>

1996
01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:30.000
<v Speaker 2>He's their lead designer on the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1997
01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:31.700
<v Speaker 2>and it's about to get overhauled as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

1998
01:28:31.701 --> 01:28:35.780
<v Speaker 2>The new version is called L and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>even more beautiful in my opinion,</v>

1999
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:40.810
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than what this four point four point </v>

2000
01:28:40.810 --> 01:28:40.810
<v Speaker 2>four that I'm working on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's another problem.</v>

2001
01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:44.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm using four point four point four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the latest android Ios.</v>

2002
01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:46.520
<v Speaker 2>What's that called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2003
01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:48.510
<v Speaker 2>it's always candy Kit Kat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kat.</v>

2004
01:28:48.970 --> 01:28:50.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next,</v>

2005
01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:55.620
<v Speaker 2>the dispersion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the specific iteration of this software </v>

2006
01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:57.350
<v Speaker 2>is you will not find it on any galaxy </v>
<v Speaker 2>device right now,</v>

2007
01:28:57.830 --> 01:29:00.350
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The updates and this,</v>

2008
01:29:00.351 --> 01:29:01.320
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

2009
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 2>this is a big</v>

2010
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:05.340
<v Speaker 3>discussion because we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>involve the carriers.</v>

2011
01:29:05.341 --> 01:29:10.341
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The carriers are really to blame for </v>

2012
01:29:10.341 --> 01:29:13.611
<v Speaker 3>enabling this process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So android in the beginning of Andrew </v>

2013
01:29:13.611 --> 01:29:17.811
<v Speaker 3>has had to meet so many sacrifices to </v>
<v Speaker 3>catch up and one of those sacrifices is </v>

2014
01:29:17.811 --> 01:29:20.490
<v Speaker 3>letting carriers dictate how they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to implement these devices.</v>

2015
01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:21.620
<v Speaker 3>Verizon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>atnt,</v>

2016
01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.970
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you buy a phone from verizon,</v>

2017
01:29:23.971 --> 01:29:26.760
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of bullshit from boot it</v>
<v Speaker 3>up and you see a verisign logo.</v>

2018
01:29:26.790 --> 01:29:29.910
<v Speaker 3>The whole juSt discussed dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some cases they put the logo right on</v>

2019
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.100
<v Speaker 3>the outside of the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a galaxy,</v>

2020
01:29:32.101 --> 01:29:35.430
<v Speaker 3>I think the [inaudible] had verizon on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the button on the front,</v>

2021
01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:38.700
<v Speaker 3>tiny little button strapped with </v>
<v Speaker 3>verizon.</v>

2022
01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:42.090
<v Speaker 3>So those are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are changes that the carriers want</v>

2023
01:29:42.091 --> 01:29:47.091
<v Speaker 3>to make because they're hoping to build </v>
<v Speaker 3>their own ecosystems and capitalize </v>

2024
01:29:47.091 --> 01:29:47.091
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The carriers are,</v>

2025
01:29:47.370 --> 01:29:49.950
<v Speaker 3>they're not in an innovative business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're in,</v>

2026
01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:55.010
<v Speaker 3>in an accounting business of finding a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to just use you for a few more </v>

2027
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:55.010
<v Speaker 3>pennies.</v>

2028
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:56.050
<v Speaker 3>You can do a little ting spot right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

2029
01:29:56.060 --> 01:30:00.210
<v Speaker 3>except for the pockets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're clever.</v>

2030
01:30:00.570 --> 01:30:05.570
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when an economy moves in that direction </v>

2031
01:30:05.570 --> 01:30:05.570
<v Speaker 3>where their objective is just a pinch </v>
<v Speaker 3>more pennies,</v>

2032
01:30:05.570 --> 01:30:10.040
<v Speaker 3>what happens to innovation takes a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking nosedive because knows I'll </v>

2033
01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:14.100
<v Speaker 3>fucking nosedive it does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because all of a sudden now the </v>

2034
01:30:14.100 --> 01:30:17.590
<v Speaker 3>bottom line is effected by someone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some nerd with a,</v>

2035
01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:19.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a report in front of them saying,</v>

2036
01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:21.420
<v Speaker 3>just get rid of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2037
01:30:21.450 --> 01:30:23.310
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's made through subtraction,</v>

2038
01:30:23.311 --> 01:30:26.340
<v Speaker 3>not addition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating.</v>

2039
01:30:26.341 --> 01:30:27.930
<v Speaker 3>That's a really interesting way to look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at it.</v>

2040
01:30:27.931 --> 01:30:30.240
<v Speaker 3>I really liked the idea that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of art.</v>

2041
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:32.940
<v Speaker 3>I love that you were looking at it that </v>
<v Speaker 3>way because you're absolutely correct.</v>

2042
01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:37.970
<v Speaker 3>I think of it as technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is something that's created </v>

2043
01:30:37.970 --> 01:30:38.310
<v Speaker 3>anything created as art and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>certainly beautiful.</v>

2044
01:30:38.570 --> 01:30:40.740
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love like scrolling through.</v>

2045
01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:45.740
<v Speaker 3>I love how android,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my galaxy note three has like a </v>

2046
01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:45.990
<v Speaker 3>different thing when I'm flipping </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the pages.</v>

2047
01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:49.830
<v Speaker 3>I like animation or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the fucking pen,</v>

2048
01:30:49.890 --> 01:30:51.760
<v Speaker 3>I love that they figured out how to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2049
01:30:51.761 --> 01:30:53.490
<v Speaker 3>And you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're using the pen on a regular basis.</v>

2050
01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:56.580
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a comic notes.</v>

2051
01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:59.910
<v Speaker 3>I knew that part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big.</v>

2052
01:31:00.060 --> 01:31:05.060
<v Speaker 3>I think there's something about </v>
<v Speaker 3>physically writing things that there is </v>

2053
01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:05.060
<v Speaker 3>a different impact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

2054
01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:07.890
<v Speaker 3>And then I upload them to um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2055
01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:12.920
<v Speaker 3>to evernote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I have the actual note itself on my </v>

2056
01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:12.990
<v Speaker 3>iphone as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

2057
01:31:13.050 --> 01:31:14.700
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh dude.</v>

2058
01:31:14.701 --> 01:31:16.430
<v Speaker 3>Evernote is fucking fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2059
01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:19.290
<v Speaker 3>But what I really love about it is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you take like,</v>

2060
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:21.500
<v Speaker 3>like a note like this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2061
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:26.340
<v Speaker 3>This is a note that I wrote on on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>note.</v>

2062
01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.080
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Decent writing yet.</v>

2063
01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:28.920
<v Speaker 3>Not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2064
01:31:29.410 --> 01:31:31.620
<v Speaker 3>So you could put it here and it comes </v>
<v Speaker 3>out like,</v>

2065
01:31:31.670 --> 01:31:32.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good man.</v>

2066
01:31:32.460 --> 01:31:33.600
<v Speaker 3>Yellow paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

2067
01:31:33.660 --> 01:31:38.660
<v Speaker 3>It's really big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you see that you're not gonna be </v>

2068
01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:42.381
<v Speaker 3>able to see it because of the phone </v>
<v Speaker 3>itself that just the glare but </v>

2069
01:31:42.381 --> 01:31:44.700
<v Speaker 3>handwritten notes come off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So responsive.</v>

2070
01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.620
<v Speaker 3>The pen is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it is definitely.</v>

2071
01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:48.780
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any handwritten note that you make?</v>

2072
01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:53.800
<v Speaker 3>It looks really like alex ohanian did a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He made a little reddit alien on the </v>

2073
01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:55.380
<v Speaker 3>note.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We put it up.</v>

2074
01:31:55.381 --> 01:31:55.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2075
01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:59.130
<v Speaker 3>you do things with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt that the</v>

2076
01:32:00.050 --> 01:32:05.050
<v Speaker 2>pen is a far more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has far more precision than your </v>

2077
01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:05.050
<v Speaker 2>fingertip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2078
01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:05.230
<v Speaker 2>no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2079
01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:07.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all kinds of industries that are</v>

2080
01:32:07.571 --> 01:32:09.670
<v Speaker 2>affected by that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Comedy is one as you,</v>

2081
01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:12.400
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also like artists for example,</v>

2082
01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:15.490
<v Speaker 2>are doing insane illustrations on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>note.</v>

2083
01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like top quality stuff on there.</v>

2084
01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:21.990
<v Speaker 2>It's the apps that exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a different sketching out.</v>

2085
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.000
<v Speaker 2>What do you got there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's something for an ounce of </v>

2086
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:27.000
<v Speaker 2>sketching up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2087
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.090
<v Speaker 2>This is actually an art app and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>great because it has,</v>

2088
01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:33.120
<v Speaker 2>it's called color box hd and it has like</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single pen you could possibly </v>

2089
01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:36.961
<v Speaker 2>imagine that uses the photoshop if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a favorite pen that you actually </v>

2090
01:32:36.961 --> 01:32:37.880
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kerrick.</v>

2091
01:32:38.050 --> 01:32:38.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2092
01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:42.470
<v Speaker 1>So now when you draw with a pen of </v>
<v Speaker 1>stylists,</v>

2093
01:32:42.471 --> 01:32:44.510
<v Speaker 1>what kind of stylist to use?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a specific one.</v>

2094
01:32:44.511 --> 01:32:44.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2095
01:32:44.650 --> 01:32:49.650
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just got this app recently </v>

2096
01:32:49.650 --> 01:32:50.440
<v Speaker 2>because I've been trying to draw more on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my ipad.</v>

2097
01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:52.870
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to use my ipad more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

2098
01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:56.010
<v Speaker 2>I have two ipads and I've been trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>just carry this around.</v>

2099
01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:58.630
<v Speaker 2>Stiff a laptop lately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a surface,</v>

2100
01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:00.330
<v Speaker 2>microsoft's version of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2101
01:33:00.331 --> 01:33:01.940
<v Speaker 2>it just released this whole thing where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2102
01:33:02.050 --> 01:33:07.050
<v Speaker 2>you could trade in your old mac book air</v>
<v Speaker 2>or and get like $650 credit towards </v>

2103
01:33:07.391 --> 01:33:12.391
<v Speaker 2>their new surface,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like their version of this </v>

2104
01:33:12.391 --> 01:33:15.391
<v Speaker 2>mixed with a laptop or a mac book air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been trying to see if I could just </v>

2105
01:33:15.391 --> 01:33:19.501
<v Speaker 2>use this more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony hinchcliffe doesn't even have a </v>

2106
01:33:19.501 --> 01:33:21.961
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything that he uses is just on an </v>

2107
01:33:21.961 --> 01:33:22.030
<v Speaker 2>ipad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ridiculous.</v>

2108
01:33:22.031 --> 01:33:27.031
<v Speaker 2>I know that when I'm trying to see if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can get to though because I love this </v>

2109
01:33:27.031 --> 01:33:27.031
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>

2110
01:33:27.031 --> 01:33:27.040
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite things at tech.</v>

2111
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:29.160
<v Speaker 1>Just bond that's a hasn't been delivered</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>

2112
01:33:29.161 --> 01:33:31.350
<v Speaker 1>but I'm looking forward to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought a mechanical keyboard.</v>

2113
01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear it.</v>

2114
01:33:33.010 --> 01:33:36.900
<v Speaker 1>You just got a major street cred in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tech world for doing that.</v>

2115
01:33:36.901 --> 01:33:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>

2116
01:33:37.650 --> 01:33:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I missed that.</v>

2117
01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Of course you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2118
01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:44.370
<v Speaker 1>It comes back to user experience in </v>
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

2119
01:33:44.430 --> 01:33:49.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about user experience is very </v>

2120
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.430
<v Speaker 1>critical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about things that I enjoy.</v>

2121
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:50.610
<v Speaker 1>I drive a manual transmission most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

2122
01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:53.180
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like shifting the gears like wow,</v>

2123
01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:57.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm a part of it and an enjoyable </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

2124
01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Tactile feel the snicks of the gear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I wouldn't want to do it if I was</v>

2125
01:34:02.361 --> 01:34:03.600
<v Speaker 1>stuck in traffic all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2126
01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:08.660
<v Speaker 1>But if I'm not stuck in traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm not going to be driving that </v>

2127
01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:10.530
<v Speaker 1>car and I think there's something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that tactile experience for sure.</v>

2128
01:34:10.580 --> 01:34:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of pushback happening now.</v>

2129
01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Digital interfaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people miss all kinds.</v>

2130
01:34:15.450 --> 01:34:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Like mechanical keyboards are a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

2131
01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:19.590
<v Speaker 1>It's also an issue with cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Electronic steering,</v>

2132
01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:22.590
<v Speaker 1>electric steering is the new thing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports cars.</v>

2133
01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2134
01:34:23.370 --> 01:34:25.020
<v Speaker 1>What people don't like about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

2135
01:34:25.021 --> 01:34:29.040
<v Speaker 1>there's actually a blowback and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are buying older sports cars that</v>

2136
01:34:29.041 --> 01:34:34.041
<v Speaker 1>have no steering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no power steering like the old </v>

2137
01:34:34.041 --> 01:34:34.920
<v Speaker 1>porsche's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2138
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:38.310
<v Speaker 1>The old porsches were super light car </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had manual steering.</v>

2139
01:34:38.311 --> 01:34:40.950
<v Speaker 1>So you turn the wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you felt everything.</v>

2140
01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're connected to those front wheels,</v>

2141
01:34:43.561 --> 01:34:47.370
<v Speaker 1>like a go cart and the new ones are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally electric,</v>

2142
01:34:47.371 --> 01:34:49.740
<v Speaker 1>so it's sort of like a video game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference.</v>

2143
01:34:49.741 --> 01:34:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have a hard turn or if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have an easy turn,</v>

2144
01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:54.360
<v Speaker 1>there's no difference in the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>correcting.</v>

2145
01:34:54.980 --> 01:34:57.880
<v Speaker 1>It's just going same as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmissions.</v>

2146
01:34:57.910 --> 01:35:00.740
<v Speaker 1>A I drove a gtr which has a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2147
01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:04.280
<v Speaker 1>the electronic transmission that's a can</v>
<v Speaker 1>can behave,</v>

2148
01:35:04.281 --> 01:35:09.281
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can shift more efficiently than any </v>

2149
01:35:09.281 --> 01:35:09.281
<v Speaker 1>human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

2150
01:35:09.281 --> 01:35:10.330
<v Speaker 1>what is that really about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2151
01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:13.100
<v Speaker 1>what are we really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we really connected to?</v>

2152
01:35:13.101 --> 01:35:18.101
<v Speaker 1>Like is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we really need to go that split </v>

2153
01:35:18.101 --> 01:35:18.440
<v Speaker 1>second faster or do we get more out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

2154
01:35:18.441 --> 01:35:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through feeling more of it.</v>

2155
01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:26.740
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to really pinpoint if you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old school muscle car and it's an </v>

2156
01:35:26.740 --> 01:35:29.981
<v Speaker 1>automatic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're missing out on half the fun of </v>

2157
01:35:29.981 --> 01:35:29.981
<v Speaker 1>having an old school muscle car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2158
01:35:29.981 --> 01:35:29.981
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2159
01:35:29.981 --> 01:35:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Shifting those gears yourself is I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>an automatic barracuda and I hated it.</v>

2160
01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I hated the fact that it was automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You used to drive me crazy,</v>

2161
01:35:36.291 --> 01:35:37.880
<v Speaker 1>but that's how they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were building it,</v>

2162
01:35:37.881 --> 01:35:41.300
<v Speaker 1>they were saying there's no way to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>this engine with a manual transfer.</v>

2163
01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:44.630
<v Speaker 1>They're just knuckleheads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I talked to a guy who I was going to</v>

2164
01:35:44.631 --> 01:35:49.631
<v Speaker 1>have it fixed up before I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them to selling it and getting </v>

2165
01:35:49.631 --> 01:35:49.631
<v Speaker 1>rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it was just.</v>

2166
01:35:49.631 --> 01:35:53.640
<v Speaker 1>There was a negative connotation </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably associated because of the </v>

2167
01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:54.350
<v Speaker 1>automatic transmission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was because of the bill.</v>

2168
01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:57.740
<v Speaker 1>I had a bill for a television show and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was always behind the scenes drama</v>

2169
01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:00.680
<v Speaker 1>from the people that made the show with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the builders of the car itself.</v>

2170
01:36:00.710 --> 01:36:02.550
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of nightmares.</v>

2171
01:36:02.551 --> 01:36:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Shit that I don't want to get into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2172
01:36:04.181 --> 01:36:04.400
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2173
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:07.160
<v Speaker 1>The big nightmare shit was that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust those things.</v>

2174
01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:10.040
<v Speaker 1>I got it home and as I was pulling into </v>
<v Speaker 1>my driveway,</v>

2175
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:13.900
<v Speaker 1>the suspension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say yes,</v>

2176
01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I was just on the highway 10 minutes ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>going 65,</v>

2177
01:36:16.851 --> 01:36:21.410
<v Speaker 1>70 miles an hour and a a death man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would have been horrendous if that</v>

2178
01:36:21.411 --> 01:36:22.010
<v Speaker 1>blew out.</v>

2179
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:25.060
<v Speaker 1>I would have crashed into other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what,</v>

2180
01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:27.800
<v Speaker 1>if I was responsible for someone else </v>
<v Speaker 1>being injured or killed,</v>

2181
01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I would have felt horrible just to drive</v>
<v Speaker 1>this cool thing.</v>

2182
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:31.580
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

2183
01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:35.630
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes get that feeling about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast cars in general,</v>

2184
01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:37.900
<v Speaker 1>like I feel like home great </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

2185
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Like you drive that car and you get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>an accident and is completely not your </v>

2186
01:36:42.910 --> 01:36:42.910
<v Speaker 1>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he goes,</v>

2187
01:36:42.910 --> 01:36:43.460
<v Speaker 1>look at the dickhead in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the fast car.</v>

2188
01:36:43.710 --> 01:36:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they should.</v>

2189
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:48.830
<v Speaker 1>I guess they should because it does say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about,</v>

2190
01:36:49.450 --> 01:36:54.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it says something about your </v>

2191
01:36:54.450 --> 01:36:54.450
<v Speaker 1>personality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2192
01:36:54.450 --> 01:36:57.480
<v Speaker 1>it auto insurers would say it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also says something about your </v>

2193
01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:00.731
<v Speaker 1>ability to control something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And The problem with buying a fast car </v>

2194
01:37:00.731 --> 01:37:05.351
<v Speaker 1>is that they don't have any gauge </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever on your ability to control </v>

2195
01:37:05.351 --> 01:37:05.351
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2196
01:37:05.351 --> 01:37:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Say like tanner foust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a race car driver,</v>

2197
01:37:06.621 --> 01:37:11.621
<v Speaker 1>the guy and tie him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet that guy walks into a corvette </v>

2198
01:37:11.621 --> 01:37:11.621
<v Speaker 1>dealership and buys a corvette.</v>

2199
01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:14.450
<v Speaker 1>You can be rest assured he knows how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>handle that,</v>

2200
01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:16.610
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of people that get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

2201
01:37:16.611 --> 01:37:18.000
<v Speaker 1>They hit the gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just spin and,</v>

2202
01:37:18.330 --> 01:37:23.330
<v Speaker 1>and slamming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know sometimes I feel like it is kind </v>

2203
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:25.811
<v Speaker 1>of bizarre that they let people walk out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the shop with 500 horsepower more.</v>

2204
01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:30.590
<v Speaker 1>How about in the shitty chassis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shelby mustangs?</v>

2205
01:37:30.591 --> 01:37:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I fucking love the shelby mustangs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2206
01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2207
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:35.720
<v Speaker 1>they're not that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

2208
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:38.450
<v Speaker 1>they have a solid rear axle there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>

2209
01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a massive piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering to control that solid rear </v>

2210
01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:45.560
<v Speaker 1>axle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you could get one for like $50,000</v>

2211
01:37:45.561 --> 01:37:49.400
<v Speaker 1>and it has 670 fucking horsepower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

2212
01:37:49.401 --> 01:37:51.410
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so fun to drive.</v>

2213
01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:53.750
<v Speaker 1>They're one of the most fun american </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars ever created.</v>

2214
01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 1>The new shelby mustangs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not the best</v>

2215
01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:01.040
<v Speaker 3>handling car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't break the best brakes are </v>

2216
01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:01.230
<v Speaker 3>mushy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That dog shit.</v>

2217
01:38:01.231 --> 01:38:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you get a convertible,</v>

2218
01:38:02.581 --> 01:38:04.740
<v Speaker 3>you might as well be driving around in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking wetland,</v>

2219
01:38:04.741 --> 01:38:09.741
<v Speaker 3>sanya noodle bouncing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the tactile field that you get from </v>

2220
01:38:10.171 --> 01:38:14.040
<v Speaker 3>those is so fun though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The engine,</v>

2221
01:38:14.110 --> 01:38:17.520
<v Speaker 3>the wine of the fucking supercharger </v>
<v Speaker 3>whine.</v>

2222
01:38:17.910 --> 01:38:20.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think sometimes efficiency is boring.</v>

2223
01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:22.470
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Prius is suck.</v>

2224
01:38:22.471 --> 01:38:24.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are boring as shit.</v>

2225
01:38:24.190 --> 01:38:25.560
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just fuel efficiency,</v>

2226
01:38:25.561 --> 01:38:28.590
<v Speaker 3>but efficiency in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like think about coffee for example.</v>

2227
01:38:29.190 --> 01:38:34.190
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could find some crazy way to </v>

2228
01:38:34.190 --> 01:38:36.681
<v Speaker 3>precision engineer some coffee bean and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and get it into a form factor that could</v>

2229
01:38:36.991 --> 01:38:40.430
<v Speaker 3>ship to you already made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you talked to any coffee connoisseur</v>

2230
01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:43.260
<v Speaker 3>and it's like they got to get the beans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got a roast the beans,</v>

2231
01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:45.870
<v Speaker 3>they got to put them in the grinder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2232
01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:49.590
<v Speaker 3>part of the experience is not just the </v>
<v Speaker 3>consumption of it,</v>

2233
01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:51.360
<v Speaker 3>but everything leading up to it.</v>

2234
01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>

2235
01:38:52.441 --> 01:38:54.020
<v Speaker 3>I heard you talking about addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2236
01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:55.090
<v Speaker 3>last night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was thinking,</v>

2237
01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:58.320
<v Speaker 3>and we were talking about ritual on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast last night.</v>

2238
01:38:58.321 --> 01:38:59.490
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2239
01:38:59.491 --> 01:39:00.450
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

2240
01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:03.120
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that at least in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>business,</v>

2241
01:39:03.121 --> 01:39:04.640
<v Speaker 3>the ritual is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2242
01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:06.630
<v Speaker 3>so wanting is way better than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>having.</v>

2243
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:12.070
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's better than having because </v>

2244
01:39:12.070 --> 01:39:16.640
<v Speaker 3>you want to know what happens when you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you have something is you </v>

2245
01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:17.910
<v Speaker 3>immediately start to think about whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not you should still have it.</v>

2246
01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:21.330
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>iT has to enter your mind at some point.</v>

2247
01:39:21.600 --> 01:39:25.110
<v Speaker 3>I think that's an attitude though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a matter of focus because</v>

2248
01:39:25.111 --> 01:39:30.111
<v Speaker 3>there are things that I have that you'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>never get rid of or feel like that that </v>

2249
01:39:30.111 --> 01:39:33.210
<v Speaker 3>you'll never get rid of my car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I might one day sell if you will,</v>

2250
01:39:33.211 --> 01:39:33.600
<v Speaker 3>one day.</v>

2251
01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:36.180
<v Speaker 3>I'd love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had it for a couple of years.</v>

2252
01:39:36.181 --> 01:39:41.181
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying you can't love products,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying it's like a </v>

2253
01:39:41.181 --> 01:39:44.421
<v Speaker 3>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just changes you when you see a </v>

2254
01:39:44.421 --> 01:39:45.960
<v Speaker 3>really hot girl and you start to hit it </v>
<v Speaker 3>off or whatever.</v>

2255
01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:49.920
<v Speaker 3>That's a certain type of magic that </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't ever happen again.</v>

2256
01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:51.030
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2257
01:39:51.031 --> 01:39:56.031
<v Speaker 3>You can never recreate that and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>people go their whole lives trying to </v>

2258
01:39:56.031 --> 01:39:56.520
<v Speaker 3>get to that first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>

2259
01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:58.350
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who did that for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>longest time.</v>

2260
01:39:58.420 --> 01:40:00.660
<v Speaker 3>Eventually got married and had a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the things he said,</v>

2261
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:02.880
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want a lot of beginnings.</v>

2262
01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:04.620
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

2263
01:40:04.621 --> 01:40:05.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't like relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2264
01:40:05.881 --> 01:40:06.990
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the beginning,</v>

2265
01:40:06.991 --> 01:40:08.720
<v Speaker 3>everybody's trying so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>

2266
01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:10.950
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's so excited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's so friendly,</v>

2267
01:40:11.110 --> 01:40:15.820
<v Speaker 3>and he goes and then all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 3>bItches are yelling overnights.</v>

2268
01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:18.240
<v Speaker 3>I just want a bunch of beginnings where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people like,</v>

2269
01:40:18.241 --> 01:40:23.241
<v Speaker 3>but not not to make this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not to pull this back and make it super </v>

2270
01:40:23.241 --> 01:40:23.241
<v Speaker 3>nerdy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the same thing here,</v>

2271
01:40:23.241 --> 01:40:24.120
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My channel,</v>

2272
01:40:24.121 --> 01:40:29.121
<v Speaker 3>it's called unbox therapy for a reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there is some kind of intangible </v>

2273
01:40:29.121 --> 01:40:30.690
<v Speaker 3>thing that happens when you get some new</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2274
01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:36.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's definitely something to </v>

2275
01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:38.121
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's also what you people would </v>

2276
01:40:38.121 --> 01:40:39.951
<v Speaker 3>say it's material fetishism that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely constantly obsessing about </v>

2277
01:40:40.051 --> 01:40:41.910
<v Speaker 3>materials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you should go for a hike,</v>

2278
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:45.480
<v Speaker 3>go out and look at the birds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See the meadows.</v>

2279
01:40:45.780 --> 01:40:48.630
<v Speaker 3>Except that except that the eventual </v>
<v Speaker 3>futures.</v>

2280
01:40:48.631 --> 01:40:53.631
<v Speaker 3>Everybody lying down on a couch with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>vr headset interacting with a world </v>

2281
01:40:53.631 --> 01:40:55.600
<v Speaker 3>isn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's possible.</v>

2282
01:40:55.700 --> 01:40:57.610
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probably inevitable.</v>

2283
01:40:57.910 --> 01:41:02.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists believe that may be going on </v>

2284
01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:04.801
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be the world we actually has </v>

2285
01:41:04.801 --> 01:41:04.801
<v Speaker 3>written.</v>

2286
01:41:04.801 --> 01:41:04.801
<v Speaker 3>It's just so complex and so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2287
01:41:04.801 --> 01:41:05.860
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could be this.</v>

2288
01:41:05.861 --> 01:41:07.720
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to talk about this cardboard </v>
<v Speaker 3>over here.</v>

2289
01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:09.550
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting back to vr.</v>

2290
01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:14.920
<v Speaker 3>There's just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could tell you were excited when I </v>

2291
01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:17.380
<v Speaker 3>first picked it up because it's a piece </v>
<v Speaker 3>of bark or something inside of it.</v>

2292
01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:19.600
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing inside of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2293
01:41:19.670 --> 01:41:20.260
<v Speaker 3>for real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2294
01:41:20.261 --> 01:41:21.940
<v Speaker 3>let's play this game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guess what it is.</v>

2295
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:25.690
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you can't open it though.</v>

2296
01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:27.730
<v Speaker 3>It stays this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2297
01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:29.770
<v Speaker 3>You know nothing of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2298
01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:30.820
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2299
01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:35.880
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would assume there's like a memory </v>

2300
01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:36.130
<v Speaker 3>card in here or a screen or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're protecting.</v>

2301
01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:37.960
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That this is the shipping material.</v>

2302
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:42.990
<v Speaker 3>That's what I would assume.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the first thing they gave us at </v>

2303
01:41:42.990 --> 01:41:46.021
<v Speaker 3>io before they gave us any watches and </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the world's cheapest vr headset </v>

2304
01:41:46.021 --> 01:41:46.021
<v Speaker 3>right here.</v>

2305
01:41:46.050 --> 01:41:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

2306
01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:50.890
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it opens up,</v>

2307
01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:53.140
<v Speaker 3>it opens up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's lenses inside of it.</v>

2308
01:41:53.141 --> 01:41:58.141
<v Speaker 3>You build it and it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a place that the phone sits </v>

2309
01:41:58.141 --> 01:41:58.141
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is nfc enabled.</v>

2310
01:41:58.141 --> 01:42:02.610
<v Speaker 3>Your phone sits on that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so your phone mounts inside of here and </v>

2311
01:42:02.610 --> 01:42:05.941
<v Speaker 3>the nfc on the back of the phone will </v>
<v Speaker 3>launch an application and that </v>

2312
01:42:05.941 --> 01:42:10.201
<v Speaker 3>application on the screen then is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to display a,</v>

2313
01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:12.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2314
01:42:12.490 --> 01:42:15.400
<v Speaker 3>through the lenses in interactivity </v>
<v Speaker 3>similar to oculus rift,</v>

2315
01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:17.690
<v Speaker 3>but right here with a piece of cardboard</v>
<v Speaker 3>for $5.</v>

2316
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:19.000
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what happens,</v>

2317
01:42:19.001 --> 01:42:20.030
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone gets cocky,</v>

2318
01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:23.230
<v Speaker 3>they spent billions of dollars to </v>
<v Speaker 3>helping oculus rift.</v>

2319
01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:26.380
<v Speaker 3>Someone comes along and says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only fuck you,</v>

2320
01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:29.260
<v Speaker 3>fuck you with cardboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's google.</v>

2321
01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:34.680
<v Speaker 3>Google did say fuck you with cardboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the real reason for that is because </v>

2322
01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:37.960
<v Speaker 3>vr is going to be tough to sell in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

2323
01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:38.560
<v Speaker 3>in the long run.</v>

2324
01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:40.810
<v Speaker 3>It's too expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too elaborate.</v>

2325
01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:44.980
<v Speaker 3>And so developers won't get on board.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a development material,</v>

2326
01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:46.770
<v Speaker 3>a development kit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>

2327
01:42:46.930 --> 01:42:51.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the imaginations of developers </v>

2328
01:42:51.930 --> 01:42:51.930
<v Speaker 3>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can,</v>

2329
01:42:51.930 --> 01:42:54.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can check out what their app might </v>

2330
01:42:54.990 --> 01:42:54.990
<v Speaker 3>be like if they did a virtual reality </v>
<v Speaker 3>version of it.</v>

2331
01:42:54.990 --> 01:42:56.890
<v Speaker 3>So for folks who are listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is most people,</v>

2332
01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:58.560
<v Speaker 3>most people download this and listened </v>
<v Speaker 3>to it,</v>

2333
01:42:58.561 --> 01:43:03.561
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we're </v>

2334
01:43:03.561 --> 01:43:03.820
<v Speaker 3>looking@islikesayifyoueverorderabookonamazon.com</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it comes in a little box,</v>

2335
01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:07.420
<v Speaker 3>it was very similar to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe back when used to buy cds.</v>

2336
01:43:07.450 --> 01:43:12.450
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You buy a cd on amazon that would get </v>

2337
01:43:12.450 --> 01:43:12.450
<v Speaker 3>delivered to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you still do that.</v>

2338
01:43:12.450 --> 01:43:13.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would look like that.</v>

2339
01:43:13.511 --> 01:43:15.790
<v Speaker 3>It's a small,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe like 10 by eight.</v>

2340
01:43:16.630 --> 01:43:17.920
<v Speaker 3>Ten by eight probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2341
01:43:17.921 --> 01:43:19.600
<v Speaker 3>Something like that just looks like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece of cardboard.</v>

2342
01:43:19.850 --> 01:43:21.370
<v Speaker 3>Have you done this yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

2343
01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:26.680
<v Speaker 3>Can we do it now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how smooth it's going to </v>

2344
01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:29.761
<v Speaker 3>be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll just know that we'll talk about </v>

2345

<v Speaker 3>inside this folded up piece of </v>

2379
01:44:43.090 --> 01:44:46.670
<v Speaker 3>cardboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's lenses to that looked like those</v>

2380
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.940
<v Speaker 3>little instamatic things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are those things called?</v>

2381
01:44:49.941 --> 01:44:51.530
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you press that button and those,</v>

2382
01:44:52.010 --> 01:44:52.610
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2383
01:44:52.611 --> 01:44:53.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like a polaroid,</v>

2384
01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:56.150
<v Speaker 3>but you remember those old school </v>
<v Speaker 3>things?</v>

2385
01:44:56.151 --> 01:44:59.660
<v Speaker 3>We had press and there will be a picture</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a dinosaur and you'd look at it.</v>

2386
01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:00.970
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>viewmaster.</v>

2387
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:04.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very much like a viewmaster lenses,</v>

2388
01:45:04.250 --> 01:45:06.710
<v Speaker 3>but I'm assuming they're a high quality </v>
<v Speaker 3>lens.</v>

2389
01:45:06.711 --> 01:45:10.550
<v Speaker 3>It's just embedded in this plastic </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they look pretty slick.</v>

2390
01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:13.490
<v Speaker 8>Does it look good?</v>

2391
01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:19.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not supposed to be looking at </v>

2392
01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:19.160
<v Speaker 3>distance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2393
01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:21.661
<v Speaker 3>We'll put this all together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going through the user experience or </v>

2394
01:45:21.661 --> 01:45:22.270
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

2395
01:45:22.271 --> 01:45:27.271
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a little bit perplexed right now to </v>

2396
01:45:27.271 --> 01:45:29.551
<v Speaker 3>insert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you should have to build this </v>

2397
01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:31.210
<v Speaker 3>google cardboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So good idea.</v>

2398
01:45:31.211 --> 01:45:32.020
<v Speaker 3>Is there any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2399
01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:35.200
<v Speaker 3>directions the directions are only </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's on there and a finished product.</v>

2400
01:45:35.201 --> 01:45:36.130
<v Speaker 3>Take care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Assemble.</v>

2401
01:45:36.131 --> 01:45:41.131
<v Speaker 3>Insert the numbered tabs into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>corresponding slots at four,</v>

2402
01:45:43.091 --> 01:45:44.050
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three,</v>

2403
01:45:44.051 --> 01:45:46.500
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two of the salt.</v>

2404
01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:48.910
<v Speaker 3>So everything's numbered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting how they did it.</v>

2405
01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:49.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2406
01:45:49.571 --> 01:45:51.160
<v Speaker 3>In the meantime I'm going to hop on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wifi.</v>

2407
01:45:51.161 --> 01:45:52.780
<v Speaker 3>Would this device.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's ready to go?</v>

2408
01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:54.020
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

2409
01:45:55.870 --> 01:45:57.580
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not good for a podcast.</v>

2410
01:45:57.730 --> 01:45:58.640
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>

2411
01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.690
<v Speaker 3>I told you we'll try it out after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2412
01:46:01.691 --> 01:46:04.840
<v Speaker 3>we'll try it out after and we'll uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll post a quick video here.</v>

2413
01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here.</v>

2414
01:46:05.650 --> 01:46:06.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could do that.</v>

2415
01:46:06.341 --> 01:46:11.341
<v Speaker 3>We can do a quick video experimentation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the role here is not only to say </v>

2416
01:46:11.341 --> 01:46:13.420
<v Speaker 3>fuck you to facebook for spending </v>
<v Speaker 3>$2,000,000,000,</v>

2417
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:18.750
<v Speaker 3>but to essentially say that vr is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get anywhere in its current </v>

2418
01:46:18.750 --> 01:46:21.781
<v Speaker 3>state and to give up a sort of a way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prototype applications without </v>

2419
01:46:22.241 --> 01:46:24.790
<v Speaker 3>necessarily investing in a vr headset </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

2420
01:46:24.860 --> 01:46:26.050
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the objective of this.</v>

2421
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:31.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the games on the iphone didn't kill </v>

2422
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:33.370
<v Speaker 3>playstation one or for whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>it or kill it.</v>

2423
01:46:33.371 --> 01:46:37.380
<v Speaker 3>But the rumor is these are the last of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the consoles really the last for,</v>

2424
01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:42.390
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the three 60 and the playstation three </v>

2425
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.390
<v Speaker 3>lasted for a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2426
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:43.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

2427
01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:45.820
<v Speaker 3>the experience of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got an xbox one recently.</v>

2428
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.370
<v Speaker 3>He played that ufc game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2429
01:46:47.371 --> 01:46:49.820
<v Speaker 3>I haven't played it yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you and I should do one.</v>

2430
01:46:49.850 --> 01:46:50.180
<v Speaker 3>One,</v>

2431
01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:52.230
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one versus one.</v>

2432
01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:54.030
<v Speaker 1>You'll get a shit ton of views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2433
01:46:54.031 --> 01:46:54.740
<v Speaker 1>that'll be fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2434
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:56.480
<v Speaker 1>definitely do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I narrated it.</v>

2435
01:46:56.490 --> 01:46:59.880
<v Speaker 1>So it'd be weird playing with my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice saying I'm right.</v>

2436
01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:01.320
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Narrate.</v>

2437
01:47:01.670 --> 01:47:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about that.</v>

2438
01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:06.120
<v Speaker 1>That'd be extra cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit took forever.</v>

2439
01:47:06.970 --> 01:47:09.420
<v Speaker 1>I had to narrate all of the specific </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements.</v>

2440
01:47:09.450 --> 01:47:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Specific combinations came out well </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

2441
01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>because was a bad mother.</v>

2443
01:47:15.031 --> 01:47:20.031

<v Speaker 1>basketball game or something and it's </v>

<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

2473
01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:52.020

<v Speaker 7>unsure if you're a real person anymore.</v>

01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:20.420
<v Speaker 7>Total disregard for the laws.</v>

2479
01:49:21.730 --> 01:49:26.730
<v Speaker 7>Spin take down.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's been leading those effectively all </v>

<v Speaker 7>I want to know what they do.</v>

2483
01:49:36.210 --> 01:49:41.210
<v Speaker 7>I mean it's a glitch obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but like what does the combination that </v>

2484
01:49:41.210 --> 01:49:44.591
<v Speaker 7>makes the character behave like this?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Gustafson for folks listening to this,</v>

2485
01:49:45.530 --> 01:49:50.530
<v Speaker 7>he's flying through the air,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like around and flipping and then </v>

2486
01:49:50.530 --> 01:49:52.630
<v Speaker 7>landing on his head and flipping around.</v>
<v Speaker 7>70 foot sliding.</v>

<v Speaker 7>We'll be looking intensely at the action</v>
<v Speaker 7>tire herself out.</v>

2492
01:50:07.271 --> 01:50:09.370
<v Speaker 7>Mike rod.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It needs to be careful not to hit her in</v>

2493
01:50:09.371 --> 01:50:14.371
<v Speaker 7>the back of the head.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Answer for this mummy guard.</v>

2494
01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:17.680

2495
01:50:17.681 --> 01:50:20.500
<v Speaker 7>You're not gonna get anything out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so just go to ea.</v>

2496
01:50:21.010 --> 01:50:22.990
<v Speaker 7>Ufc glitches.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Tommy toehold,</v>

2497
01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:25.960
<v Speaker 7>he's a really funny guy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He does a lot of these videos.</v>

2498
01:50:26.110 --> 01:50:29.530
<v Speaker 7>He's got a whole series of them.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Really funny stuff</v>

2499
01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:33.240
<v Speaker 2>on most of it on a ufc and mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch how it ends I think,</v>

2500
01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:35.840
<v Speaker 7>and</v>

2501
01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:39.010
<v Speaker 2>nothing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's funny.</v>

2502
01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:41.520
<v Speaker 2>So those little glitches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not good.</v>

2503
01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:46.780
<v Speaker 2>No very upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're upset that you just showed the </v>

2504
01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:49.590
<v Speaker 2>actual tough shit because a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to keep people from </v>

2505
01:50:49.590 --> 01:50:51.460
<v Speaker 2>buying a patch a wave to fix that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's just funny enough.</v>

2506
01:50:51.461 --> 01:50:52.210
<v Speaker 2>Two people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2507
01:50:52.211 --> 01:50:55.120
<v Speaker 2>there's a new ufc game out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2508
01:50:55.121 --> 01:50:58.390
<v Speaker 2>but that's the reason I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not fully on board with it,</v>

2509
01:50:58.391 --> 01:51:03.391
<v Speaker 2>is only because it kind of fucks up or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between independent </v>

2510
01:51:03.391 --> 01:51:05.440
<v Speaker 2>content creators and game developers </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what they do is,</v>

2511
01:51:05.441 --> 01:51:10.441
<v Speaker 2>and the reality are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to take a hard line stance </v>

2512
01:51:10.441 --> 01:51:12.100
<v Speaker 2>and then it happened with nintendo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fucked up.</v>

2513
01:51:12.250 --> 01:51:16.210
<v Speaker 2>They were guys making a career posting </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos about nintendo shit gone complete</v>

2514
01:51:16.211 --> 01:51:18.460
<v Speaker 2>career over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2515
01:51:18.850 --> 01:51:22.480
<v Speaker 2>that's bad on nintendo and nintendo got </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit for it,</v>

2516
01:51:22.481 --> 01:51:24.880
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't change the reality.</v>

2517
01:51:25.050 --> 01:51:28.060
<v Speaker 2>You know my joke because I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>attach all there that money,</v>

2518
01:51:28.061 --> 01:51:30.160
<v Speaker 2>all that advertising youtube money too.</v>

2519
01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:35.080
<v Speaker 2>That's extra income now for a nintendo </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to put an intender videos up.</v>

2520
01:51:35.081 --> 01:51:38.550
<v Speaker 2>Now tendo owns the rights to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they get money off all of these.</v>

2521
01:51:38.710 --> 01:51:43.710
<v Speaker 2>There's a real discussion about whose </v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual property that is that we </v>

2522
01:51:43.710 --> 01:51:47.641
<v Speaker 2>just watched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did we watch something for me a or did </v>

2523
01:51:47.641 --> 01:51:48.130
<v Speaker 2>we watch something from tommy toehold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>toehold.</v>

2524
01:51:48.490 --> 01:51:50.560
<v Speaker 2>And he see he doesn't have a product </v>
<v Speaker 2>without them,</v>

2525
01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:55.860
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have a product without them </v>

2526
01:51:55.860 --> 01:51:57.480
<v Speaker 2>in this instance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they might put a block on that </v>

2527
01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:57.480
<v Speaker 2>particular video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2528
01:51:57.930 --> 01:52:02.930
<v Speaker 2>why don't they would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the ufc sanctions his show that </v>

2529
01:52:02.930 --> 01:52:02.930
<v Speaker 2>like his show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

2530
01:52:02.930 --> 01:52:04.570
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sure he has some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrangement with them.</v>

2531
01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't think it's going to be an </v>

2532
01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:09.620
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2533
01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:12.540
<v Speaker 2>go for the record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's funny as hell and I w I </v>

2534
01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:12.540
<v Speaker 2>would totally watch it at all.</v>

2535
01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:17.010
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to say is that I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of friends in the gaming </v>

2536
01:52:17.010 --> 01:52:17.980
<v Speaker 2>side of youtube and fucking disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2537
01:52:17.981 --> 01:52:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does that work?</v>

2538
01:52:19.361 --> 01:52:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Like when guys are doing comments when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're commentating on a match,</v>

2539
01:52:23.140 --> 01:52:25.750
<v Speaker 2>who owns that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like star crash or.</v>

2540
01:52:26.510 --> 01:52:28.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are big things,</v>

2541
01:52:28.301 --> 01:52:28.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

2542
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:33.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Podcasts and most of the super </v>

2543
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:33.790
<v Speaker 2>competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2544
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:37.530
<v Speaker 2>gaming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The developers are on board with it </v>

2545
01:52:37.530 --> 01:52:38.700
<v Speaker 2>because that's the big part of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>community business model,</v>

2546
01:52:39.010 --> 01:52:44.010
<v Speaker 2>but generally speaking they're also </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in the events themselves and </v>

2547
01:52:44.010 --> 01:52:48.601
<v Speaker 2>the setup and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have a more control than an </v>

2548
01:52:48.601 --> 01:52:49.630
<v Speaker 2>independent guy in his bedroom or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever his office shopping together,</v>

2549
01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:54.640
<v Speaker 2>something like that know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are enormous youtubers like </v>

2550
01:52:55.520 --> 01:52:58.280
<v Speaker 2>tens of 10 million subscribers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 million subscribers,</v>

2551
01:52:58.281 --> 01:53:01.220
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that their whole model is playing games,</v>

2552
01:53:01.221 --> 01:53:06.221
<v Speaker 2>other people's intellectual property and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no clear guideline yet on </v>

2553
01:53:06.221 --> 01:53:07.310
<v Speaker 2>what's considered fair use and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>

2554
01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:09.590
<v Speaker 2>especially when you're commercializing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the content.</v>

2555
01:53:09.770 --> 01:53:14.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys who make create the video </v>

2556
01:53:14.770 --> 01:53:17.411
<v Speaker 2>games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it would be foolish to try to stop </v>

2557
01:53:17.411 --> 01:53:17.570
<v Speaker 2>any sort of an interactive community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what we all think.</v>

2558
01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:22.660
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got some gray hair dudes sitting </v>

2559
01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:25.151
<v Speaker 2>in an office that they actually got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>job after blockbuster went under these </v>

2560
01:53:25.151 --> 01:53:27.440
<v Speaker 2>motherfuckers and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2561
01:53:27.441 --> 01:53:29.580
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's their way of that.</v>

2562
01:53:29.610 --> 01:53:31.970
<v Speaker 2>That's the way they behave and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to change overnight.</v>

2563
01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Malicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How blockbuster went down.</v>

2564
01:53:33.951 --> 01:53:36.290
<v Speaker 2>I warned them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on the board.</v>

2565
01:53:36.291 --> 01:53:41.291
<v Speaker 2>I told him you got to be careful because</v>
<v Speaker 2>these dvds or on the light and laser </v>

2566
01:53:41.991 --> 01:53:44.780
<v Speaker 2>discs that have ruined our market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

2567
01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:49.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much everything within the next </v>

2568
01:53:49.930 --> 01:53:49.930
<v Speaker 2>couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2569
01:53:49.930 --> 01:53:50.510
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a cd slot that I,</v>

2570
01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:52.870
<v Speaker 2>a usb cd slot that I attached to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2571
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:55.820
<v Speaker 2>external or dvds on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never used it once.</v>

2572
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Never touched it.</v>

2573
01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:02.160
<v Speaker 2>And it made me realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember when the floppy disk went away </v>

2574
01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:02.160
<v Speaker 2>and everybody fucking freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like apple said,</v>

2575
01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:06.611
<v Speaker 2>no more floppies no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the weird thing about </v>

2576
01:54:06.611 --> 01:54:08.900
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking earlier about how,</v>

2577
01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:14.680
<v Speaker 2>about how about how uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these devices are becoming almost a </v>

2578
01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:15.500
<v Speaker 2>status symbol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having old shit.</v>

2579

<v Speaker 2>People were going to sneer at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You rock and old computer and old </v>

2585
01:54:32.211 --> 01:54:34.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a tech prejudice.</v>

2586
01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:37.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you have an archi?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll have an rq park.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2588
01:54:38.871 --> 01:54:42.500
<v Speaker 2>where they put a piece of tape over that</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

2589
01:54:42.501 --> 01:54:47.501
<v Speaker 2>folsom tape up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>draw the letter or on it and stick it </v>

2590

<v Speaker 2>do you save old tech?</v>

2592
01:54:47.970 --> 01:54:51.170
<v Speaker 2>Like I just found my own a dash the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other day.</v>

2593
01:54:51.171 --> 01:54:54.300
<v Speaker 2>I was just wanting to have the stats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a dash that's not.</v>

2594
01:54:55.130 --> 01:54:57.710
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain age at which I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it becomes cool again,</v>

2595
01:54:57.711 --> 01:54:59.780
<v Speaker 2>kind of like cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I recently,</v>

2596
01:54:59.781 --> 01:55:01.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed my four year old,</v>

2597
01:55:01.161 --> 01:55:06.161
<v Speaker 2>the original second genesis and we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>playing streets of rage heat and he </v>

2598
01:55:06.161 --> 01:55:10.241
<v Speaker 2>fucking dominating what you said for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that because it gave me that game at </v>

2599
01:55:10.241 --> 01:55:10.910
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be crying,</v>

2600
01:55:11.330 --> 01:55:12.080
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2601
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:13.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2602
01:55:13.011 --> 01:55:17.030
<v Speaker 2>I like to sort of go back and those </v>
<v Speaker 2>origin stories in my childhood and stuff</v>

2603
01:55:17.031 --> 01:55:17.770
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2604
01:55:17.771 --> 01:55:20.420
<v Speaker 2>I did an unboxing video of the original </v>
<v Speaker 2>nes,</v>

2605
01:55:20.421 --> 01:55:25.050
<v Speaker 2>nintendo 1985 found going one in mint </v>
<v Speaker 2>condition in the box seat.</v>

2606
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:26.480
<v Speaker 2>People in the comments were telling me </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2607
01:55:26.481 --> 01:55:28.100
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this brought tears to my eyes,</v>

2608
01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:31.430
<v Speaker 2>just swear to god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not because of the product,</v>

2609
01:55:31.431 --> 01:55:33.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that because of the promise?</v>

2610
01:55:33.770 --> 01:55:38.770
<v Speaker 2>If you remember being a kid and that nes</v>
<v Speaker 2>being under that christmas tree at that </v>

2611
01:55:38.770 --> 01:55:39.450
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

2612
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:42.320
<v Speaker 2>if your dad was a fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know your mom was a bitch,</v>

2613
01:55:42.930 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 2>that console</v>

2614
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:49.040
<v Speaker 3>strong words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that console for a moment guaranteed a </v>

2615
01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:50.730
<v Speaker 3>certain number of hours together because</v>
<v Speaker 3>people use the game together.</v>

2616
01:55:51.780 --> 01:55:53.970
<v Speaker 3>Like for me and my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me and my brother,</v>

2617
01:55:54.150 --> 01:55:56.340
<v Speaker 3>that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is under the tree,</v>

2618
01:55:56.370 --> 01:55:57.470
<v Speaker 3>you look at one another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2619
01:55:57.480 --> 01:56:00.620
<v Speaker 3>I know what this means.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not about the console and,</v>

2620
01:56:00.621 --> 01:56:04.410
<v Speaker 3>and this is a huge problem with gaming </v>
<v Speaker 3>now is that it's all online.</v>

2621
01:56:04.680 --> 01:56:07.260
<v Speaker 3>Yet the most beautiful shit happens in </v>
<v Speaker 3>real life.</v>

2622
01:56:07.290 --> 01:56:10.980
<v Speaker 3>You want to fuck up the guy next to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not some dude in who knows where.</v>

2623
01:56:11.010 --> 01:56:12.780
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why land part is they're so fun.</v>

2624

<v Speaker 3>multiplayer match will be over.</v>

2629
01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:28.940
<v Speaker 3>The losing team would run up to where </v>
<v Speaker 3>the winning team wasn't immediately </v>

<v Speaker 3>those are fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2636
01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:35.380
<v Speaker 3>Land parties are fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's so.</v>

2637
01:56:35.381 --> 01:56:40.381
<v Speaker 3>It's so true too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about so many games taking place online </v>

2638
01:56:40.381 --> 01:56:43.341
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So much of the experiences people not </v>

2639
01:56:43.341 --> 01:56:46.161
<v Speaker 3>interacting with other people online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very different experience than </v>

2640
01:56:46.161 --> 01:56:49.041
<v Speaker 3>being in a room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if we set up computers on this </v>

2641
01:56:49.041 --> 01:56:49.530
<v Speaker 3>beautiful big ass table,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this would be a great place for India.</v>

2642
01:56:49.690 --> 01:56:52.410
<v Speaker 3>A safe place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This will be the who was land party ever</v>

2643
01:56:52.540 --> 01:56:54.270
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely mario kart.</v>

2644
01:56:54.330 --> 01:56:56.700
<v Speaker 3>We should totally have a fucking party </v>
<v Speaker 3>here down.</v>

2645
01:56:57.130 --> 01:57:00.630
<v Speaker 3>I haven't played quake forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet I suck my ass.</v>

2646
01:57:00.631 --> 01:57:02.040
<v Speaker 3>I was never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was never that good.</v>

2647
01:57:02.041 --> 01:57:07.041
<v Speaker 3>So while I was never good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was good compared to regular </v>

2648
01:57:07.041 --> 01:57:09.351
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But listen to this elitist talk over </v>

2649
01:57:09.351 --> 01:57:09.900
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

2650
01:57:09.930 --> 01:57:10.140
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>

2651
01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:12.270
<v Speaker 3>Compared to regular compared to regular </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2652
01:57:12.271 --> 01:57:15.510
<v Speaker 3>I'll fuck you up compared to like those </v>
<v Speaker 3>real quake players.</v>

2653
01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:17.220
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like those guys always killed me.</v>

2654
01:57:17.221 --> 01:57:22.221
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well see this is about like the brands </v>

2655
01:57:22.221 --> 01:57:24.441
<v Speaker 3>trying to to own the entire experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to own not just your money when </v>

2656
01:57:26.941 --> 01:57:31.941
<v Speaker 3>you buy the game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they want to own everything you do </v>

2657
01:57:31.941 --> 01:57:33.861
<v Speaker 3>with that game after the fact.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You take this psychological approach </v>

2658
01:57:33.861 --> 01:57:37.611
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think that it's a very </v>

2659
01:57:37.611 --> 01:57:38.751
<v Speaker 3>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just the psychological approach to </v>

2660
01:57:38.751 --> 01:57:38.751
<v Speaker 3>the reason why people become fanboys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but particular brands,</v>

2661
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:44.030
<v Speaker 3>but the interactive experience of two </v>
<v Speaker 3>people enjoying the video game together </v>

2662
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:48.030
<v Speaker 3>been like those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those fight games,</v>

2663
01:57:48.090 --> 01:57:49.830
<v Speaker 3>those karate games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2664
01:57:49.831 --> 01:57:52.410
<v Speaker 3>like mortal kombat duking it out with </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other.</v>

2665
01:57:52.560 --> 01:57:55.560
<v Speaker 3>That's half the fun is that you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it with another person.</v>

2666
01:57:55.570 --> 01:57:56.360
<v Speaker 3>We used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2667
01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:58.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get home from school and I mean,</v>

2668
01:57:58.290 --> 01:57:59.340
<v Speaker 3>you knew who was good.</v>

2669
01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:01.590
<v Speaker 3>The guy who was good was the guy down </v>
<v Speaker 3>the street,</v>

2670
01:58:01.970 --> 01:58:02.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>

2671
01:58:02.850 --> 01:58:03.690
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beat the game.</v>

2672
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:05.320
<v Speaker 3>Didn't die once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2673
01:58:06.110 --> 01:58:07.890
<v Speaker 3>it were legends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Legends were made,</v>

2674
01:58:07.891 --> 01:58:12.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's an anonymous face somewhere </v>

2675
01:58:12.891 --> 01:58:12.891
<v Speaker 3>else and everyone's bitching and </v>
<v Speaker 3>complaining online.</v>

2676
01:58:13.110 --> 01:58:15.060
<v Speaker 3>You get on xbox live.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a disaster.</v>

2677
01:58:15.330 --> 01:58:19.920
<v Speaker 3>The thing about those games though is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they can make the day vanish.</v>

2678
01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:21.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are magic.</v>

2679
01:58:22.050 --> 01:58:25.200
<v Speaker 3>You throw those games on your day and oh</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2680
01:58:25.201 --> 01:58:27.000
<v Speaker 3>you're starving to death and it's three </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning.</v>

2681
01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:33.880
<v Speaker 3>That happened at world of warcraft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That baby died more than one.</v>

2682
01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:36.240
<v Speaker 3>More than one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a few of them.</v>

2683
01:58:36.430 --> 01:58:41.430
<v Speaker 3>It was war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See those games scare the shit out of </v>

2684
01:58:41.430 --> 01:58:43.791
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't get invested for that reason </v>

2685
01:58:43.791 --> 01:58:43.791
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what's going to happen</v>

2686
01:58:43.791 --> 01:58:47.010
<v Speaker 2>though is especially with all the apple </v>
<v Speaker 2>tv's and and like google tvs and stuff </v>

2687
01:58:47.010 --> 01:58:48.520
<v Speaker 2>that we're getting going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are going to start taking over the</v>

2688
01:58:48.521 --> 01:58:51.400
<v Speaker 2>game market to a point where all our </v>
<v Speaker 2>phones are going to be controllers.</v>

2689
01:58:51.640 --> 01:58:56.640
<v Speaker 2>If you have an apple tv you can use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could download a angry birds and we </v>

2690
01:58:56.640 --> 01:58:58.000
<v Speaker 2>all come over to my house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all pull out our phones.</v>

2691
01:58:58.020 --> 01:59:00.210
<v Speaker 2>I can hit up your controller app and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>all are applying.</v>

2692
01:59:00.270 --> 01:59:02.620
<v Speaker 2>It can already send.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have apple tv.</v>

2693
01:59:02.621 --> 01:59:07.621
<v Speaker 2>You can already send images and video </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen and you could watch it up on a </v>

2694
01:59:07.621 --> 01:59:08.500
<v Speaker 2>big screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll touch a video.</v>

2695
01:59:08.530 --> 01:59:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately they can't if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're connected,</v>

2696
01:59:11.950 --> 01:59:16.950
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're tapped in oculus rift </v>

2697
01:59:16.950 --> 01:59:18.901
<v Speaker 2>style plugged in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't monetize what's going on </v>

2698
01:59:18.901 --> 01:59:19.660
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The enjoyment we're having,</v>

2699
01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:22.270
<v Speaker 2>they don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't do fuck all for them.</v>

2700
01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Like they intend to wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it first launched,</v>

2701
01:59:24.461 --> 01:59:26.590
<v Speaker 2>it was all about getting together with </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>

2702
01:59:26.680 --> 01:59:31.680
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't even have online gaming I </v>

2703
01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:33.181
<v Speaker 2>believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you play sports and people are </v>

2704
01:59:33.181 --> 01:59:35.550
<v Speaker 2>goofing around in front of the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>tv and dancing and doing whatever it </v>

2705
01:59:35.550 --> 01:59:35.550
<v Speaker 2>was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was too.</v>

2706
01:59:35.550 --> 01:59:39.571
<v Speaker 2>It got to a point and then didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now nintendo has all kinds of problems </v>

2707
01:59:39.571 --> 01:59:42.691
<v Speaker 2>because at first it was like it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately appealing and then it </v>

2708
01:59:42.691 --> 01:59:43.270
<v Speaker 2>eventually fizzled out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't have that same kind of.</v>

2709
01:59:43.330 --> 01:59:45.090
<v Speaker 2>Nobody gives a fuck about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're never here when.</v>

2710
01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2711
01:59:46.810 --> 01:59:48.520
<v Speaker 2>But in your bedroom it changes </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2712
01:59:48.590 --> 01:59:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

2713
01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're back to playing.</v>

2714
01:59:50.561 --> 01:59:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I took.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took my wig.</v>

2715
01:59:51.621 --> 01:59:53.620
<v Speaker 2>You never used it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got the new eu.</v>

2716
01:59:53.900 --> 01:59:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Has a nice big controller,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tablet and stuff.</v>

2717
01:59:56.321 --> 01:59:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Never touched it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Decided fuck it.</v>

2718
01:59:58.151 --> 02:00:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put in my bedroom tv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use it for netflix.</v>

2719
02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:03.320
<v Speaker 2>Now I can't get enough of it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got a huge screen,</v>

2720
02:00:03.321 --> 02:00:05.980
<v Speaker 2>so you're scrolling through netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surfing the net,</v>

2721
02:00:06.010 --> 02:00:11.010
<v Speaker 2>and then you watch it on the screen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you watch on the screen is the perfect </v>

2722
02:00:11.010 --> 02:00:13.540
<v Speaker 2>bedroom pool video games so better as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>controller than as a video game console.</v>

2723
02:00:14.190 --> 02:00:15.220
<v Speaker 2>It kind of is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2724
02:00:15.250 --> 02:00:20.250
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just great because your controller </v>

2725
02:00:20.250 --> 02:00:22.681
<v Speaker 2>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like having an ipad and you're </v>

2726
02:00:22.681 --> 02:00:23.170
<v Speaker 2>searching for videos on netflix or stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>

2727
02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:25.450
<v Speaker 2>which is way better than using your </v>
<v Speaker 2>remote control.</v>

2728
02:00:25.451 --> 02:00:27.230
<v Speaker 2>The fund,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the r dot,</v>

2729
02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:32.760
<v Speaker 2>o dot s and when you're trying to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>the name of a movie that is annoying as </v>

2730

<v Speaker 2>fuck that you can't just go like that </v>

<v Speaker 2>version of that,</v>

2733
02:00:39.621 --> 02:00:41.110
<v Speaker 2>of the xbox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that connect?</v>

2734
02:00:41.111 --> 02:00:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it's called?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it called?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2736
02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:47.830
<v Speaker 2>And it's like a video thing to camera </v>
<v Speaker 2>sees your body move.</v>

2737
02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:50.080
<v Speaker 2>How is that not ready for prime time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You don't look excited.</v>

2739
02:00:51.970 --> 02:00:56.970
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a huge controversy with it </v>

2740
02:00:56.970 --> 02:00:58.680
<v Speaker 2>over them having it all be always on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2741
02:00:58.690 --> 02:01:02.300
<v Speaker 2>so they could watch fuck on the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't do,</v>

2742
02:01:02.630 --> 02:01:07.630
<v Speaker 2>we came,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we seem to keep coming back to that </v>

<v Speaker 2>but we're immature.</v>

2744
02:01:10.300 --> 02:01:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Perfect spot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2745
02:01:12.730 --> 02:01:14.770
<v Speaker 2>so there was a big controversy at first </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2746
02:01:14.810 --> 02:01:19.810
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that nobody wanted it and they were </v>

2747
02:01:19.810 --> 02:01:19.810
<v Speaker 2>including the names then it was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be always on and then,</v>

2748
02:01:19.810 --> 02:01:21.190
<v Speaker 2>and then it was gonna be expensive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that shit.</v>

2749
02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:23.380
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reason I think people don't want</v>

2750
02:01:23.381 --> 02:01:28.381
<v Speaker 2>it is because like an xbox buyer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to look at the core </v>

2751
02:01:28.381 --> 02:01:28.381
<v Speaker 2>demographic of who's going to get an </v>
<v Speaker 2>xbox.</v>

2752
02:01:28.381 --> 02:01:29.220
<v Speaker 2>The minute it comes out it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2753
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:31.870
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain sex in a certain age </v>
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>

2754
02:01:31.871 --> 02:01:32.420
<v Speaker 2>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2755
02:01:32.421 --> 02:01:37.421
<v Speaker 2>that stuff is popular with and they want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to run around shooting people online </v>

2756
02:01:37.421 --> 02:01:39.010
<v Speaker 2>essentially the vast majority or play </v>
<v Speaker 2>sports games,</v>

2757
02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:39.740
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>

2758
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:44.330
<v Speaker 1>And there's just only so much you can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now in terms of emotion game.</v>

2759
02:01:44.910 --> 02:01:46.820
<v Speaker 1>I do I want to do dance dance </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

2760
02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I want to.</v>

2761
02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Do people learn martial arts on those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

2762
02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>It's striking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martial arts could learn.</v>

2763
02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:54.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the joe rogan game,</v>

2764
02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:59.400
<v Speaker 4>the fitness apps joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or some of the best things about the </v>

2765
02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:02.731
<v Speaker 4>connect because it reads your body and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so like if you're doing like some kind </v>

2766
02:02:02.731 --> 02:02:05.350
<v Speaker 4>of hard workout that they have available</v>
<v Speaker 4>using xbox fitness,</v>

2767
02:02:05.530 --> 02:02:07.240
<v Speaker 4>it will tell you if you're not bending </v>
<v Speaker 4>your arms,</v>

2768
02:02:07.241 --> 02:02:07.500
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2769
02:02:07.540 --> 02:02:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your arms,</v>

2770
02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:10.960
<v Speaker 1>big drums and it tracks how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>calories,</v>

2771
02:02:10.990 --> 02:02:13.690
<v Speaker 1>so I want you to do that with martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts techniques.</v>

2772
02:02:13.750 --> 02:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2773
02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:15.470
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2774
02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:16.060
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2775
02:02:16.110 --> 02:02:16.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2776
02:02:16.340 --> 02:02:16.930
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2777
02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Not somebody with his credibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2778
02:02:18.801 --> 02:02:23.801
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be something that would be </v>

2779
02:02:23.801 --> 02:02:26.251
<v Speaker 1>really beneficial to someone learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts techniques because most of </v>

2780
02:02:26.251 --> 02:02:30.751
<v Speaker 1>the striking techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a striking with your hands </v>

2781
02:02:30.751 --> 02:02:31.300
<v Speaker 1>or with your feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knees and elbows,</v>

2782
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>you're learning them in the air before </v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever strike things as like a </v>

2783
02:02:36.750 --> 02:02:38.350
<v Speaker 1>beginner sort of not even just as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginner,</v>

2784
02:02:38.380 --> 02:02:42.730
<v Speaker 1>like one of the most important things </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I teach people a kicks,</v>

2785
02:02:42.910 --> 02:02:47.910
<v Speaker 1>specific kicks is practicing them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there because if you're constantly </v>

2786
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>relying on hitting something to maintain</v>
<v Speaker 1>your balance and to maintain the </v>

2787
02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>distribution of your weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bounce off of things and you'll.</v>

2788
02:02:54.931 --> 02:02:59.931
<v Speaker 1>You'll rely on those things if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>penetrate them enough and one of the </v>

2789
02:02:59.931 --> 02:03:04.051
<v Speaker 1>keys to learning how to kick correctly </v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually learning how to kick in the </v>

2790
02:03:04.051 --> 02:03:04.051
<v Speaker 1>air.</v>

2791
02:03:04.051 --> 02:03:08.070
<v Speaker 1>It's also controlling the dexterity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your legs because you're not relying on </v>

2792
02:03:08.070 --> 02:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>anything to stop the momentum of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>

2793
02:03:09.430 --> 02:03:14.430
<v Speaker 1>You have to tighten up your entire body </v>
<v Speaker 1>on on the extension of the kick or the </v>

2794
02:03:14.430 --> 02:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>punch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in doing so,</v>

2795
02:03:15.461 --> 02:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>you actually strengthened the tendons </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're doing it correctly,</v>

2796
02:03:19.630 --> 02:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>you develop more dexterity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more dexterity.</v>

2797
02:03:21.701 --> 02:03:26.701
<v Speaker 1>When you're throwing kicks your ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was always a thing in </v>

2798
02:03:26.701 --> 02:03:26.701
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2799
02:03:26.701 --> 02:03:28.120
<v Speaker 1>my instructor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>

2800
02:03:28.180 --> 02:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jay hahn,</v>

2801
02:03:29.141 --> 02:03:34.141
<v Speaker 1>kim will do these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do these really impressive </v>

2802
02:03:34.141 --> 02:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations where they would throw </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicks at your face,</v>

2803
02:03:35.590 --> 02:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>like you would stand there and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would stop them like right here,</v>

2804
02:03:38.741 --> 02:03:39.650
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop at all.</v>

2805
02:03:39.740 --> 02:03:41.120
<v Speaker 1>We would all do that and demonstrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2806
02:03:41.121 --> 02:03:41.470
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2807
02:03:41.471 --> 02:03:42.490
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael o'malley,</v>

2808
02:03:42.491 --> 02:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>who's another one of my instructors </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's this incredible,</v>

2809
02:03:44.711 --> 02:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>a taekwondo black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple times national champion,</v>

2810
02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>and he's a big tall guy and he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw these insanely impressive kicks,</v>

2811
02:03:52.151 --> 02:03:56.520
<v Speaker 1>like half an inch from your face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just we'll kicks where the toad just,</v>

2812
02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:00.550
<v Speaker 1>just he knew because he threw so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicks in the air,</v>

2813
02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:02.590
<v Speaker 1>he knew where objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he knew how to stop.</v>

2814
02:04:02.591 --> 02:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>So you developed this dexterity so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could use that.</v>

2815
02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>The teaching is correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you would essentially need is an </v>

2816
02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:12.150
<v Speaker 1>open area where you could extend your </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

2817
02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:17.160
<v Speaker 1>but I was just about to say is that how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people are going to put their foot </v>

2818
02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:18.900
<v Speaker 1>through their tv on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's actually actually two</v>

2819
02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:21.720
<v Speaker 4>games that I know of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one's called ufc trainer,</v>

2820
02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:24.310
<v Speaker 4>which is a game that does,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does that,</v>

2821
02:04:24.311 --> 02:04:29.311
<v Speaker 4>it teaches you different ufc moves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a new ronda rousey one also </v>

2822
02:04:29.311 --> 02:04:29.610
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2823
02:04:29.670 --> 02:04:31.770
<v Speaker 4>that you just does that pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 4>does.</v>

2824
02:04:31.810 --> 02:04:35.520
<v Speaker 4>It uses your connect and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it teaches you different moves.</v>

2825
02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:37.400
<v Speaker 4>Kick to the balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kids</v>

2826
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:41.530
<v Speaker 2>kick the balls when you're ready.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go and kick you out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2841
02:05:25.710 --> 02:05:26.190

2859
02:06:15.811 --> 02:06:20.811
<v Speaker 2>I'm not that addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like this whole process of doing </v>

2860
02:06:20.811 --> 02:06:22.710
<v Speaker 2>what I do has actually desensitizes me </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a way to a lot of this stuff.</v>

2861
02:06:22.711 --> 02:06:25.760
<v Speaker 2>Like I think I was in in some ways more </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a fanatic before then.</v>

2862
02:06:25.761 --> 02:06:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Now that make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How come you're jaded?</v>

2863
02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you don't see my kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2864
02:06:33.271 --> 02:06:36.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you're just normalized.</v>

2865
02:06:36.230 --> 02:06:40.950
<v Speaker 2>What it is is it's like so much for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people.</v>

2866
02:06:40.980 --> 02:06:45.980
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these devices are really important to </v>

2867
02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:45.980
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get,</v>

2868
02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:45.980
<v Speaker 2>they get some new thing that's like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>super highlight,</v>

2869
02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:50.750
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you're going to be </v>

2870
02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:51.330
<v Speaker 2>psychologically impacted when companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>are just sending you fucking everything.</v>

2871
02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:54.750
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] how can it not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It affects you get everything for free.</v>

2874
02:06:57.540 --> 02:06:58.320
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everything.</v>

2875
02:06:58.321 --> 02:07:00.960
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to keep them and this and this.</v>

2876
02:07:00.961 --> 02:07:02.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to pay for your laptop.</v>

2877
02:07:03.110 --> 02:07:06.490
<v Speaker 2>That's apples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apple won't give you shit really ever.</v>

2878
02:07:06.810 --> 02:07:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you use something that's.</v>

2879
02:07:08.580 --> 02:07:13.580
<v Speaker 2>You said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you say there's all these windows </v>

02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:13.580
<v Speaker 2>computers that are grades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the user experience was not as good</v>

02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:18.390
<v Speaker 2>when he loves windows.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>

2884
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:25.830

<v Speaker 2>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear this clearly as I.</v>

2886
02:07:27.930 --> 02:07:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Let me put it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me put it this way.</v>

2887
02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much that the vast majority of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in my business on youtube,</v>

2888
02:07:33.570 --> 02:07:36.370
<v Speaker 2>I know them all personally use apple </v>
<v Speaker 2>computers.</v>

2889
02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:41.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of universal amongst anybody </v>

2890
02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:41.700
<v Speaker 3>who has enough money to buy an apple </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer.</v>

2891
02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:44.590
<v Speaker 3>Dell pc people are going to fucking not </v>
<v Speaker 3>like you saying that.</v>

2892
02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:45.370
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

2893
02:07:45.371 --> 02:07:47.470

<v Speaker 3>dark shit.</v>

2894
02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:52.050
<v Speaker 3>Tried windows seven diggity diggity dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a reason why apple is,</v>

2895
02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:54.340
<v Speaker 3>is the company they are and microsoft is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a company there.</v>

2896
02:07:54.341 --> 02:07:55.570
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the way I like to say it.</v>

2897
02:07:55.660 --> 02:07:58.220
<v Speaker 3>We used alienware for the podcast for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while,</v>

2898
02:07:58.470 --> 02:08:03.470
<v Speaker 3>which makes fucking awesome computers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We use it for the podcast for awhile </v>

2899
02:08:03.470 --> 02:08:07.320
<v Speaker 3>because they were sponsoring us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they gave us some free computers and </v>

2900
02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:07.570
<v Speaker 3>and I liked that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Last box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2910
02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:22.810
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of guys had been sponsored so </v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2911
02:08:22.830 --> 02:08:25.150
<v Speaker 3>we really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The computers are incredible.</v>

2912
02:08:25.151 --> 02:08:28.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean and they are as far as like high </v>
<v Speaker 3>end laptops,</v>

2913
02:08:28.251 --> 02:08:30.220
<v Speaker 3>like for gaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're monstrous.</v>

2914
02:08:30.221 --> 02:08:31.960
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I didn't like the interface.</v>

2915
02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:34.270
<v Speaker 3>The windows notifications kept popping </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2916
02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:39.540
<v Speaker 3>All these different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The notification is driving me fucking </v>

2917
02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:39.540
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit was ridiculous.</v>

2918
02:08:40.220 --> 02:08:43.390
<v Speaker 3>This is a clunky operating system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys are clunkers.</v>

2919
02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:44.110
<v Speaker 3>It's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2920
02:08:44.111 --> 02:08:46.930
<v Speaker 3>They the gates too busy chasing pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what he's doing.</v>

2921
02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:48.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doing coke.</v>

2922
02:08:48.670 --> 02:08:53.670
<v Speaker 3>He's flying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>flying around his private fucking </v>

2923
02:08:53.670 --> 02:08:53.800
<v Speaker 3>spacecraft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Allegedly.</v>

2924
02:08:53.860 --> 02:08:58.300
<v Speaker 3>Allegedly because tooling around fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>harbor and his boat.</v>

2925
02:08:58.600 --> 02:09:01.190
<v Speaker 3>Microsoft does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does some good things like the xbox.</v>

2926
02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.340
<v Speaker 3>It's a success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The xbox is success.</v>

2927
02:09:03.550 --> 02:09:06.460
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If microsoft is so god damn popular,</v>

2928
02:09:06.461 --> 02:09:10.220
<v Speaker 3>why if microsoft is so immersive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>microsoft's prop problem is that they're</v>

2929
02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:11.650
<v Speaker 3>so damn popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2930
02:09:12.010 --> 02:09:17.010
<v Speaker 3>They had to fucking hold on to vintage </v>
<v Speaker 3>retro stuff for so long because </v>

2931
02:09:17.591 --> 02:09:19.200
<v Speaker 3>otherwise they would give up a </v>
<v Speaker 3>percentage of the mark.</v>

2932
02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:22.960
<v Speaker 3>God forbid somebody can't type a word </v>
<v Speaker 3>document or open their excel spreadsheet</v>

2933
02:09:22.961 --> 02:09:25.990
<v Speaker 3>from 1997.</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really what held them back.</v>

2934
02:09:26.260 --> 02:09:27.970
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2935
02:09:28.570 --> 02:09:30.430
<v Speaker 3>how do they hold them back in the user </v>
<v Speaker 3>interface though?</v>

2936
02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:35.320
<v Speaker 3>Because when they put out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they put out windows a seven,</v>

2937
02:09:35.650 --> 02:09:37.990
<v Speaker 3>they put this new.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it seven or eight?</v>

2938
02:09:37.991 --> 02:09:38.380
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

2939
02:09:38.381 --> 02:09:43.381
<v Speaker 3>windows eight new ui,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they didn't really want to give a </v>

2940
02:09:43.381 --> 02:09:43.500
<v Speaker 3>name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>

2941
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:47.170
<v Speaker 3>it was essentially a touch based ui that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a huge overhaul,</v>

2942
02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:52.240
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where now they wanted one platform to </v>

2943
02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:52.240
<v Speaker 3>work on tablets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>laptops,</v>

2944
02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:52.750
<v Speaker 3>desktops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>etc.</v>

2945
02:09:53.380 --> 02:09:55.450
<v Speaker 3>People freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People were like,</v>

2946
02:09:55.451 --> 02:09:56.860
<v Speaker 3>how am I going to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A,</v>

2947
02:09:56.861 --> 02:09:57.400
<v Speaker 3>b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>

2948
02:09:57.401 --> 02:09:59.260
<v Speaker 3>d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the market penetration of the</v>

2949
02:09:59.261 --> 02:10:02.290
<v Speaker 3>old ostp windows seven and xp before </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2950
02:10:02.290 --> 02:10:07.290
<v Speaker 3>So on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The voice of the people that their old </v>

2951
02:10:07.290 --> 02:10:09.880
<v Speaker 3>customers was louder than that of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>new customers.</v>

2952
02:10:09.881 --> 02:10:12.320
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have yet much like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>automakers in,</v>

2953
02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:13.020
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2954
02:10:13.090 --> 02:10:16.480
<v Speaker 3>the domestic automakers I think had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same problem here.</v>

2955
02:10:16.481 --> 02:10:21.481
<v Speaker 3>Your user base gets so big that your </v>
<v Speaker 3>user base gets so big that you're more </v>

2956
02:10:22.571 --> 02:10:27.571
<v Speaker 3>worried about pissing them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you are about attracting new </v>

2957
02:10:27.571 --> 02:10:27.571
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

2958
02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:29.170
<v Speaker 3>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

2959
02:10:29.430 --> 02:10:31.930
<v Speaker 3>They have to take those things into </v>
<v Speaker 3>consideration when they,</v>

2960
02:10:32.050 --> 02:10:34.400
<v Speaker 3>when they innovate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to pull back all the time,</v>

2961
02:10:35.630 --> 02:10:40.630
<v Speaker 3>but if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want ever bought a mac book </v>

2962
02:10:40.630 --> 02:10:40.630
<v Speaker 3>because they were worried about </v>
<v Speaker 3>microsoft word.</v>

2963
02:10:40.630 --> 02:10:44.740
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the key is you bought a macbook </v>

2964
02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:47.170
<v Speaker 3>because it was a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just a platform and essentially like </v>

2965
02:10:47.170 --> 02:10:47.510
<v Speaker 3>when you deal with things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>documents,</v>

2966
02:10:47.511 --> 02:10:49.410
<v Speaker 3>spreadsheets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2967
02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:52.280
<v Speaker 3>dot doc things almost anything can open </v>
<v Speaker 3>those now.</v>

2968
02:10:52.281 --> 02:10:54.080
<v Speaker 3>It's not just microsoft word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

2969
02:10:54.081 --> 02:10:59.081
<v Speaker 3>and that's their problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that what the exclusivity that they </v>

2970
02:10:59.081 --> 02:11:00.620
<v Speaker 3>had for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not really that important anymore.</v>

2971
02:11:00.621 --> 02:11:02.690
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once upon a time it was,</v>

2972
02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:04.040
<v Speaker 3>but now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean google has everything.</v>

2973
02:11:04.041 --> 02:11:05.770
<v Speaker 3>You do everything in the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google docs does everything.</v>

2974
02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:07.490
<v Speaker 3>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't touched a microsoft product in</v>

2975
02:11:07.491 --> 02:11:11.270
<v Speaker 3>a very long time in terms of software,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which brings me to those google laptops.</v>

2976
02:11:11.330 --> 02:11:13.610
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel about those chromebooks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you like them?</v>

2977
02:11:13.670 --> 02:11:15.100
<v Speaker 3>I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2978
02:11:15.550 --> 02:11:16.140
<v Speaker 3>you fuck with them.</v>

2979
02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:21.400
<v Speaker 4>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the perfect finally price point to </v>

2980
02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:25.301
<v Speaker 4>be able to give somebody like your mom a</v>
<v Speaker 4>laptop and have her do exactly what she </v>

2981
02:11:25.431 --> 02:11:30.431
<v Speaker 4>wants to do with no extra bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my mom just probably wants to just </v>

2982
02:11:30.431 --> 02:11:32.240
<v Speaker 4>surf the net.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe look at some photos,</v>

2983
02:11:32.241 --> 02:11:35.840
<v Speaker 4>watched some netflix and that's all </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's really probably going to do to the</v>

2984
02:11:35.841 --> 02:11:38.300
<v Speaker 4>max.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's not going to be editing videos and</v>

2985
02:11:38.301 --> 02:11:43.301
<v Speaker 4>if she desert,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's an app that she can </v>

2986
02:11:43.301 --> 02:11:43.301
<v Speaker 4>actually do it at if she wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is a lot of people</v>

2987
02:11:43.301 --> 02:11:46.210
<v Speaker 3>saying with chromebooks is why aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>chromebooks just android books,</v>

2988
02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:51.880
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is enormous ecosystem of apps available </v>

2989
02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:52.200
<v Speaker 3>on android.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it because of the fact that chrome is</v>

2990
02:11:52.210 --> 02:11:54.510
<v Speaker 3>their browser and they're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chrome is their browser.</v>

2991
02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:57.410
<v Speaker 3>Make the leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the girl,</v>

2992
02:11:57.420 --> 02:11:58.000
<v Speaker 3>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

2993
02:11:58.060 --> 02:11:58.830
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By,</v>

2994
02:11:58.900 --> 02:12:03.900
<v Speaker 3>by far too crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They beat out microsoft internet </v>

2995
02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:06.660
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>ASk people who ask the average person </v>

2996
02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:07.740
<v Speaker 3>how they feel about google in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2997
02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:10.780
<v Speaker 3>and everyone always thinks it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>positive brand.</v>

2998
02:12:11.410 --> 02:12:15.430
<v Speaker 3>Ask them how they feel about microsoft </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's a completely different.</v>

2999
02:12:15.670 --> 02:12:17.710
<v Speaker 3>So maybe there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

3000
02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:22.760
<v Speaker 3>some public relations issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly what he got fucked </v>

3001
02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:25.981
<v Speaker 3>up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but google appears like this company </v>

3002
02:12:25.981 --> 02:12:29.041
<v Speaker 3>that's giving us all this great shit and</v>
<v Speaker 3>not asking for anything because what </v>

3003
02:12:29.041 --> 02:12:31.000
<v Speaker 3>they're asking for is fucking way deeper</v>
<v Speaker 3>than that.</v>

3004
02:12:32.020 --> 02:12:33.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're asking for connection with you.</v>

3005
02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:35.650
<v Speaker 3>They're asking for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're asking for.</v>

3006
02:12:35.670 --> 02:12:40.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're immersing themselves in your </v>

3007
02:12:40.670 --> 02:12:40.670
<v Speaker 3>world and to control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want more than your wallet.</v>

3008
02:12:40.670 --> 02:12:43.480
<v Speaker 3>Google and microsoft and apple and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody else.</v>

3009
02:12:43.481 --> 02:12:45.220
<v Speaker 3>Remember that song?</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want your soul.</v>

3010
02:12:45.880 --> 02:12:48.760
<v Speaker 3>You are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your house is it?</v>

3011
02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:49.510
<v Speaker 3>oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3012
02:12:49.930 --> 02:12:50.560
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3013
02:12:50.740 --> 02:12:52.060
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody else.</v>

3014
02:12:52.270 --> 02:12:53.080
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool song.</v>

3015
02:12:53.470 --> 02:12:56.890
<v Speaker 3>But essentially about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This immersive connection.</v>

3016
02:12:57.020 --> 02:13:02.020
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that microsoft fucked up </v>

3017
02:13:02.020 --> 02:13:03.601
<v Speaker 3>because they were a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were essentially one of the very </v>

3018
02:13:03.601 --> 02:13:06.120
<v Speaker 3>first like portals into this new world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3019
02:13:06.250 --> 02:13:08.920
<v Speaker 3>like using windows and this world of </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>

3020
02:13:08.921 --> 02:13:13.921
<v Speaker 3>but now there's new world has kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>emerged from the people who grew up in </v>

3021
02:13:14.351 --> 02:13:19.351
<v Speaker 3>the internet and they grew up with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>accountability of forums of social </v>

3022
02:13:20.201 --> 02:13:23.680
<v Speaker 3>media.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take it as a given that this,</v>

3023
02:13:23.730 --> 02:13:27.110
<v Speaker 3>this accountability has sort of shaped </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they do business were,</v>

3024
02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:32.400
<v Speaker 3>which is what I've been saying for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time is what gives me hope because </v>

3025
02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:34.050
<v Speaker 3>I think the smartest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most innovative,</v>

3026
02:13:34.051 --> 02:13:39.051
<v Speaker 3>most progressive people in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of technology and innovation </v>

3027
02:13:39.051 --> 02:13:39.060
<v Speaker 3>also are very ethical.</v>

3028
02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:39.900
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3029
02:13:39.901 --> 02:13:42.330
<v Speaker 3>it seems to be a part of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>package.</v>

3030
02:13:42.331 --> 02:13:45.690
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't hear about evil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big new tech companies.</v>

3031
02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:50.840
<v Speaker 3>You hear about companies like google </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies that are trying to do things </v>

3032
02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:55.101
<v Speaker 3>correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That there were a couple of protests at </v>

3033
02:13:55.101 --> 02:13:56.340
<v Speaker 3>google io.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course they're a,</v>

3034
02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:59.250
<v Speaker 3>they recently acquired a boston </v>
<v Speaker 3>dynamics.</v>

3035
02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:00.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They make robots.</v>

3036
02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:04.230
<v Speaker 3>You make pretty fucking gnarly robots </v>
<v Speaker 3>are robots pro and so,</v>

3037
02:14:04.231 --> 02:14:05.340
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they also,</v>

3038
02:14:05.630 --> 02:14:10.630
<v Speaker 3>they also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of their technology goes into some </v>

3039
02:14:10.630 --> 02:14:10.630
<v Speaker 3>of those drones doing that activity out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3040
02:14:10.630 --> 02:14:12.000
<v Speaker 3>how about artificial intelligence as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well?</v>

3041
02:14:12.001 --> 02:14:17.001
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they also have kurzweil on board who </v>

3042
02:14:17.001 --> 02:14:17.001
<v Speaker 3>wants to make people turn into fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>computers.</v>

3043
02:14:17.001 --> 02:14:20.870
<v Speaker 3>So The overlords.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't honestly don't be scared.</v>

3044
02:14:21.660 --> 02:14:26.460
<v Speaker 3>I feel like super technologically </v>
<v Speaker 3>advanced people are insanely secular.</v>

3045
02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:29.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where their moral compass </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

3046
02:14:29.251 --> 02:14:33.890
<v Speaker 3>I think they get off on control really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In what way?</v>

3047
02:14:34.590 --> 02:14:36.030
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

3048
02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:39.380
<v Speaker 3>Look at google's ecosystem for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or even apple's.</v>

3049
02:14:39.450 --> 02:14:41.310
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everywhere you go.</v>

3050
02:14:41.311 --> 02:14:43.980
<v Speaker 3>The objective of one product is to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>you to buy the next one.</v>

3051
02:14:44.010 --> 02:14:46.920
<v Speaker 3>Is it though is the objective of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>products?</v>

3052
02:14:46.930 --> 02:14:48.990
<v Speaker 3>Let's talk about google maps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google.</v>

3053
02:14:49.020 --> 02:14:54.020
<v Speaker 3>Google is an advertising company and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny that I'm talking about them </v>

3054
02:14:54.020 --> 02:14:55.470
<v Speaker 3>because in a sense that employee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the both of us,</v>

3055
02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:59.820
<v Speaker 3>we both post shit on youtube and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a big fan since monday and I love.</v>

3056
02:15:00.660 --> 02:15:03.000
<v Speaker 3>I have a unique insight as well because </v>
<v Speaker 3>a good friend works there.</v>

3057
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:04.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At a very high level.</v>

3058
02:15:04.190 --> 02:15:09.190
<v Speaker 3>My friends worked there too and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to say anything negative </v>

3059
02:15:09.190 --> 02:15:09.300
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but.</v>

3060
02:15:09.301 --> 02:15:10.020
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you're not.</v>

3061
02:15:10.230 --> 02:15:14.760
<v Speaker 3>But the model is such that for us to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most out of technology,</v>

3062
02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:16.980
<v Speaker 3>we technology has to get the most out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

3063
02:15:17.190 --> 02:15:19.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But isn't that just a side effect of the</v>

3064
02:15:19.381 --> 02:15:20.310
<v Speaker 3>immersion?</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

3065
02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:21.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don'T think that's what I said.</v>

3066
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:24.310
<v Speaker 3>It's not negative or positive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just is.</v>

3067
02:15:24.900 --> 02:15:29.900
<v Speaker 3>But that's what we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>today about your phone preemptively </v>

3068
02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:34.551
<v Speaker 3>knowing how far you are from work </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're going to work and it's </v>

3069
02:15:34.551 --> 02:15:36.030
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We always look at the negatives,</v>

3070
02:15:36.031 --> 02:15:39.780
<v Speaker 3>but the positives of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's go back to the porsche or let's go</v>

3071
02:15:39.781 --> 02:15:44.781
<v Speaker 3>back to the muscle car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That there will always be individuals </v>

3072
02:15:44.781 --> 02:15:44.781
<v Speaker 3>that liked it better the way it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

3073
02:15:44.781 --> 02:15:46.890
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the good thing is you can have both,</v>

3074
02:15:47.520 --> 02:15:48.570
<v Speaker 3>but you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With phones,</v>

3075
02:15:49.230 --> 02:15:50.220
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some do.</v>

3076
02:15:50.230 --> 02:15:53.660
<v Speaker 3>Do they go back to the flip phone?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We sell them on ting tang.</v>

3077
02:15:53.690 --> 02:15:57.540
<v Speaker 3>So they sold the beautiful fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty button phones.</v>

3078
02:15:58.590 --> 02:16:01.350
<v Speaker 3>My guess would be that that's not an </v>
<v Speaker 3>expanding market.</v>

3079
02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:06.380
<v Speaker 3>Dana white,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fucking uses one of those all the </v>

3080
02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:06.380
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how he does all his texting.</v>

3081
02:16:06.380 --> 02:16:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you do appreciate you telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>that to everybody.</v>

3082
02:16:07.170 --> 02:16:08.640
<v Speaker 3>He loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He jokes about it.</v>

3083
02:16:08.641 --> 02:16:13.641
<v Speaker 3>He takes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have pictures of him holding up his </v>

3084
02:16:13.641 --> 02:16:13.641
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He um,</v>

3085
02:16:13.641 --> 02:16:16.790
<v Speaker 3>he can do it at a dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could be at dinner and he's so good </v>

3086
02:16:16.790 --> 02:16:20.631
<v Speaker 3>with his thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] he can be underneath the </v>

3087
02:16:20.631 --> 02:16:23.511
<v Speaker 3>table texting you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a very bizarre use case scenario </v>

3088
02:16:23.511 --> 02:16:24.960
<v Speaker 3>I liked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really like it.</v>

3089
02:16:24.961 --> 02:16:27.510

<v Speaker 3>So I've had him show me.</v>

3090
02:16:27.690 --> 02:16:30.130
<v Speaker 3>He's done it before where he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll go,</v>

3091
02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:36.120
<v Speaker 1>he'll look at his phone real quick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then he puts it out because he gets it </v>

3092
02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:36.340
<v Speaker 1>onto my number and he puts it under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>table and just.</v>

3093
02:16:36.341 --> 02:16:37.630
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

3100
02:16:51.521 --> 02:16:52.900
<v Speaker 1>That's a skill he doesn't want to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

3101
02:16:52.930 --> 02:16:54.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got to stick with it.</v>

3102
02:16:54.131 --> 02:16:59.131
<v Speaker 1>It is a skill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading this thing the other day </v>

3103
02:16:59.131 --> 02:17:01.891
<v Speaker 1>about typing and handwriting recognition</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that they were </v>

3104
02:17:01.891 --> 02:17:05.620
<v Speaker 1>talking about was shorthand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that like,</v>

3105
02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:08.140
<v Speaker 1>people forget that short really writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3106
02:17:08.141 --> 02:17:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3107
02:17:08.860 --> 02:17:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Gregg shorthand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called.</v>

3108
02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:13.810
<v Speaker 1>I forget the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like really old technology from the</v>

3109
02:17:13.811 --> 02:17:15.220
<v Speaker 1>18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow.</v>

3110
02:17:15.250 --> 02:17:17.890
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the implementation of it when they first</v>

3111
02:17:17.891 --> 02:17:20.530
<v Speaker 1>started using it and like what things </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand for,</v>

3112
02:17:20.531 --> 02:17:25.531
<v Speaker 1>what vowels and what things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could write hundreds of words </v>

3113
02:17:25.531 --> 02:17:27.040
<v Speaker 1>per minute in shorthand faster than you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could ever fucking type.</v>

3114
02:17:27.130 --> 02:17:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3115
02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.920
<v Speaker 1>But it never took off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it did.</v>

3116
02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:34.950
<v Speaker 1>It just took off for people didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers and once people develop </v>

3117
02:17:34.950 --> 02:17:39.361
<v Speaker 1>typewriters and computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a new pen that they have that </v>

3118
02:17:39.361 --> 02:17:39.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

3119
02:17:39.790 --> 02:17:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ordered it just to see like what the </v>

3120
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:44.790
<v Speaker 1>fuck the technology was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3121
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:45.400
<v Speaker 1>one of those scribe pens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>

3122
02:17:45.401 --> 02:17:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what it does.</v>

3123
02:17:46.751 --> 02:17:50.440
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't just know this is what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>does as you're writing,</v>

3124
02:17:50.590 --> 02:17:53.590
<v Speaker 1>it takes a photograph of your notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

3125
02:17:53.770 --> 02:17:58.770
<v Speaker 1>It also transcribes and audio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if there's an audio recording </v>

3126
02:17:58.770 --> 02:17:59.360
<v Speaker 1>capability.</v>

3127
02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:00.940
<v Speaker 1>So say if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I were talking,</v>

3128
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:03.550
<v Speaker 1>I was doing an interview with you and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was asking you about all these different</v>

3129
02:18:03.551 --> 02:18:06.580
<v Speaker 1>things and I was writing down my notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would take photos of the notes and it</v>

3130
02:18:06.581 --> 02:18:11.581
<v Speaker 1>would take photos of the notes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>correspond those notes to the audio </v>

3131
02:18:11.581 --> 02:18:13.720
<v Speaker 1>recording.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I said at that time has come,</v>

3132
02:18:13.790 --> 02:18:18.790
<v Speaker 1>no biggest dick is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like I would click on that and </v>

3133
02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:21.931
<v Speaker 1>then it would go back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation where You were talking </v>

3134
02:18:21.931 --> 02:18:22.150
<v Speaker 1>about women always being in pain when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have sex.</v>

3135
02:18:22.151 --> 02:18:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

3136
02:18:22.810 --> 02:18:24.250
<v Speaker 1>that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3137
02:18:24.430 --> 02:18:27.590
<v Speaker 1>So for students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a student lecture,</v>

3138
02:18:27.610 --> 02:18:30.040
<v Speaker 1>whatever that perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect example,</v>

3139
02:18:30.220 --> 02:18:32.100
<v Speaker 1>as long as it didn't lecture was clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

3140
02:18:32.101 --> 02:18:34.030
<v Speaker 1>You didn't take in too much extraneous </v>
<v Speaker 1>noise.</v>

3141
02:18:34.031 --> 02:18:39.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were close to the actual yes or </v>

3142
02:18:39.031 --> 02:18:39.031
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what a great idea.</v>

3143
02:18:39.031 --> 02:18:39.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3144
02:18:39.031 --> 02:18:40.350
<v Speaker 1>I think I should pull up the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3145
02:18:40.380 --> 02:18:43.620
<v Speaker 1>the name of it just in case I've heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

3146
02:18:43.750 --> 02:18:44.560
<v Speaker 1>I've never tried it.</v>

3147
02:18:44.570 --> 02:18:49.570
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to have the old one where you </v>

3148
02:18:49.570 --> 02:18:49.700
<v Speaker 4>just had a little memory card and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>just remembered what you wrote.</v>

3149
02:18:50.080 --> 02:18:55.080
<v Speaker 4>And I just never really does he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does this translate the written word </v>

3150
02:18:55.080 --> 02:18:56.990
<v Speaker 4>into a digital form?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a very good question.</v>

3151
02:18:56.991 --> 02:18:57.950
<v Speaker 4>Icd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

3152
02:18:58.010 --> 02:18:59.720
<v Speaker 4>I think it did back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3153
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:04.990
<v Speaker 4>I never really played with it too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I know like a lot of things can do </v>

3154
02:19:04.990 --> 02:19:04.990
<v Speaker 4>that now with most scanners.</v>

3155
02:19:05.310 --> 02:19:09.810
<v Speaker 1>it's called a live scribe guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why fly pen?</v>

3156
02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:11.820
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3157
02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm really curious to try this thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

3158
02:19:14.221 --> 02:19:16.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish almost that I was a reporter will</v>

3159
02:19:16.681 --> 02:19:19.890
<v Speaker 1>report on it when you get hit much work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

3160
02:19:20.060 --> 02:19:25.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea behind it is quite fascinating </v>

3161
02:19:25.060 --> 02:19:25.060
<v Speaker 1>and I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3162
02:19:25.060 --> 02:19:27.950
<v Speaker 1>I had read something about shorthand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where,</v>

3163
02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:28.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

3164
02:19:28.860 --> 02:19:29.450
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3165
02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:32.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys have been around for a bit,</v>

3166
02:19:32.900 --> 02:19:35.120
<v Speaker 1>but this is obviously a new product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3167
02:19:35.330 --> 02:19:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shorthand is fucking interesting,</v>

3168
02:19:37.911 --> 02:19:39.860
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>

3169
02:19:39.890 --> 02:19:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is gregg shorthand.</v>

3170
02:19:41.601 --> 02:19:46.601
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>named after the inventor who's named </v>

3171
02:19:46.601 --> 02:19:46.601
<v Speaker 1>john robert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greg,</v>

3172
02:19:46.601 --> 02:19:48.560
<v Speaker 1>system of penn stenography that gained </v>
<v Speaker 1>popularity,</v>

3173
02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:53.980
<v Speaker 1>popularity in the early 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was a crate created a long </v>

3174
02:19:54.231 --> 02:19:55.550
<v Speaker 1>fucking time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No kidding.</v>

3175
02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:56.870
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3176
02:19:56.900 --> 02:20:01.900
<v Speaker 1>but I love the idea that this pen </v>
<v Speaker 1>records an audio of us having a </v>

3177
02:20:01.900 --> 02:20:04.130
<v Speaker 1>conversation and then like I should use </v>
<v Speaker 1>it for podcasts.</v>

3178
02:20:04.190 --> 02:20:08.780
<v Speaker 1>That's really what I think I might </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually use it because I have stacks of</v>

3179
02:20:08.781 --> 02:20:13.781
<v Speaker 1>these things sometimes that I go over </v>
<v Speaker 1>like these nodes during shows.</v>

3180
02:20:14.060 --> 02:20:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm underperforming you only</v>

3181
02:20:16.071 --> 02:20:18.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you took like one note so </v>
<v Speaker 1>far today.</v>

3182
02:20:18.170 --> 02:20:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really usually things that I wanted</v>

3183
02:20:19.881 --> 02:20:24.881
<v Speaker 1>to talk about that I forgot or that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew I was going to look that or didn't </v>

3184
02:20:24.881 --> 02:20:29.141
<v Speaker 1>want to forget or an idea that I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>while it was happening because I don't </v>

3185
02:20:29.141 --> 02:20:31.430
<v Speaker 1>remember half of these fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nigerian gay marriage.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The world's end herbie's infected monkey</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Florida?</v>

3188
02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:39.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional needs dog.</v>

02:20:42.921 --> 02:20:46.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know what half these </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking things mean what the point was.</v>

3192
02:20:46.551 --> 02:20:51.551
<v Speaker 1>But if I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had written them down with a </v>

3193
02:20:51.551 --> 02:20:51.890
<v Speaker 1>corresponding audio recording,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3194
02:20:51.891 --> 02:20:53.370
<v Speaker 1>then I would really be able to click on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3195
02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Possibly jr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The that's when he was talking about </v>

<v Speaker 1>this and I wanted to bring up that </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

3197
02:20:59.590 --> 02:21:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Just I love that aspect of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of new technology and apparently it </v>

3198
02:21:04.590 --> 02:21:05.840
<v Speaker 1>works on a special type of paper as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

3202
02:21:11.820 --> 02:21:14.300
<v Speaker 1>I think you should do not doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should.</v>

3203
02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:15.920
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you about it and you could do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3204
02:21:15.930 --> 02:21:20.420
<v Speaker 1>That's why I have decided to limit </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself as far as how many things I do.</v>

3205
02:21:21.410 --> 02:21:23.600
<v Speaker 1>If I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will just keep doing things true.</v>

3206
02:21:23.660 --> 02:21:24.320
<v Speaker 1>And next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3207
02:21:24.321 --> 02:21:26.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll be a professional racquetball </v>
<v Speaker 1>player or something stupid,</v>

3208
02:21:26.841 --> 02:21:28.820
<v Speaker 1>which would be pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take up a lot of time.</v>

3209
02:21:30.380 --> 02:21:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever my disease is,</v>

3210
02:21:33.321 --> 02:21:34.760
<v Speaker 1>I know how to manage it.</v>

3211
02:21:34.970 --> 02:21:36.230
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do too many things.</v>

3212
02:21:36.231 --> 02:21:37.930
<v Speaker 1>So no unboxing videos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3213
02:21:37.950 --> 02:21:38.140
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3214
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:43.150
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just joking around what you want to </v>

3215
02:21:43.150 --> 02:21:45.401
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like the origin of unboxing </v>

3216
02:21:45.401 --> 02:21:46.460
<v Speaker 1>videos is the everyday guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not in this world.</v>

3217
02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3218
02:21:48.170 --> 02:21:53.170
<v Speaker 1>getting something and giving you his </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaction in some ways you become </v>

3219
02:21:53.170 --> 02:21:57.311
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated to a point where you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>not be addressing the things that the </v>

3220
02:21:57.311 --> 02:21:57.311
<v Speaker 1>everyday guy is looking to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>addressed.</v>

3221
02:21:57.311 --> 02:22:02.310
<v Speaker 1>It's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but essentially you are the everyday </v>

3222
02:22:02.310 --> 02:22:03.830
<v Speaker 1>god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sTill am the everyday guy but immersed</v>

3223
02:22:03.831 --> 02:22:08.831
<v Speaker 1>in this world of technology and a far </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper level and isn't it the everyday </v>

3224
02:22:08.831 --> 02:22:11.890
<v Speaker 1>guys opportunity to listen to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch those and then I'm on.</v>

3225
02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:15.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the joe rogan podcast right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

3226
02:22:16.610 --> 02:22:18.470
<v Speaker 1>in some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes you already everyday guy,</v>

3227
02:22:18.471 --> 02:22:20.630
<v Speaker 1>but when you start talking to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>brands directly,</v>

3228
02:22:20.631 --> 02:22:23.840
<v Speaker 1>things get fucking weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but things get weird.</v>

3229
02:22:23.841 --> 02:22:25.440
<v Speaker 1>It affects you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you a does.</v>

3230
02:22:25.450 --> 02:22:25.660
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

3231
02:22:25.990 --> 02:22:27.660
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesN't affect us.</v>

3232
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:28.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean it does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't.</v>

3233
02:22:29.010 --> 02:22:33.640
<v Speaker 3>It goes men.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what way did you do,</v>

3234
02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:37.010
<v Speaker 3>do you like put on kid gloves for lg?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3235
02:22:37.020 --> 02:22:37.800
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3236
02:22:37.860 --> 02:22:38.440
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3237
02:22:38.580 --> 02:22:41.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm having a hard way to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm finding it hard to articulate,</v>

3238
02:22:41.491 --> 02:22:43.380
<v Speaker 3>but tech news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3239
02:22:43.470 --> 02:22:45.770
<v Speaker 3>Big tech sites that are out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3240
02:22:46.920 --> 02:22:49.890
<v Speaker 3>They have a report underneath on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>review,</v>

3241
02:22:49.891 --> 02:22:54.891
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the product they're reviewing does a </v>

3242
02:22:54.891 --> 02:22:56.070
<v Speaker 3>huge banner ad right above it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3243
02:22:56.071 --> 02:23:00.180
<v Speaker 3>but if they are honest and always </v>
<v Speaker 3>committed to being honest,</v>

3244
02:23:00.210 --> 02:23:03.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean that isn't that goddamn essential</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the company themselves.</v>

3245
02:23:03.420 --> 02:23:05.040
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you put out a dud,</v>

3246
02:23:05.250 --> 02:23:07.050
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you put out a fucking done.</v>

3247
02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:12.200
<v Speaker 3>Well you need to do is get rid of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>weak ass engineers and designers to put </v>

3248
02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:12.200
<v Speaker 3>out that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doug,</v>

3249
02:23:12.200 --> 02:23:12.590
<v Speaker 3>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your fucking business is gonna.</v>

3250
02:23:12.610 --> 02:23:13.920
<v Speaker 3>Go under.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do do that.</v>

3251
02:23:13.921 --> 02:23:16.530
<v Speaker 3>There's a tide coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you've got a shitty foundation,</v>

3252
02:23:16.850 --> 02:23:18.990
<v Speaker 3>fucking house is going to get into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ocean definitely,</v>

3253
02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:24.200
<v Speaker 3>but all these tech websites have a floor</v>
<v Speaker 3>full of salespeople in a floor full of </v>

3254
02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:26.250
<v Speaker 3>reporters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those floor for whoever's the problem.</v>

3255
02:23:26.310 --> 02:23:28.200
<v Speaker 3>Then they need to say anybody's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

3256
02:23:28.201 --> 02:23:31.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying thrown into the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not reporting on a murder.</v>

3257
02:23:31.380 --> 02:23:36.380
<v Speaker 3>You're reporting on something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody spending a lot of money to try </v>

3258
02:23:36.380 --> 02:23:36.380
<v Speaker 3>and sell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if it's dog shit,</v>

3259
02:23:36.380 --> 02:23:37.800
<v Speaker 3>dog shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with that,</v>

3260
02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:43.040
<v Speaker 3>but that's not so much of an issue </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore because this is getting really </v>

3261
02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:43.950
<v Speaker 3>iterative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not so much an issue anymore of dog</v>

3262
02:23:43.951 --> 02:23:44.970
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dog shit.</v>

3263
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.770
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about a sliver.</v>

3264
02:23:47.520 --> 02:23:50.940
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a popular tech website that I won't name</v>

3265
02:23:51.930 --> 02:23:54.990
<v Speaker 3>for a very long time has been running </v>
<v Speaker 3>ties.</v>

3266
02:23:54.991 --> 02:23:59.580
<v Speaker 3>They do appoint analysis on devices and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd been running ties on the flagship,</v>

3267
02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:01.680
<v Speaker 3>a android phones and the iphone.</v>

3268
02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:05.640
<v Speaker 3>A tie on a point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a decimal point analysis.</v>

3269
02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:07.680
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck do they tie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3270
02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:10.590
<v Speaker 3>We'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tie exactly because they just tie.</v>

3271
02:24:10.591 --> 02:24:11.430
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3272
02:24:11.460 --> 02:24:16.460
<v Speaker 3>they do not because they're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they don't want to piss people </v>

3273
02:24:16.460 --> 02:24:16.460
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you don't believe them.</v>

3274
02:24:16.590 --> 02:24:18.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I won't make that leap,</v>

3275
02:24:18.690 --> 02:24:22.250
<v Speaker 3>but when I see something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I automatically might.</v>

3276
02:24:22.270 --> 02:24:25.590
<v Speaker 3>My mind starts telling me that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>something more here than meets the eye.</v>

3277
02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:30.100
<v Speaker 3>Isn't there an issue also with putting a</v>
<v Speaker 3>quantitative value on a roof?</v>

3278
02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:32.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most dedicated five stalls,</v>

3279
02:24:33.040 --> 02:24:38.040
<v Speaker 3>four and a half star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm talking like eight point three </v>

3280
02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:41.790
<v Speaker 3>decimal point analysis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What we saw that about the ufc game when</v>

3281
02:24:41.791 --> 02:24:46.791
<v Speaker 3>you were watching that connect ufc game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like six point five and it's </v>

3282
02:24:46.791 --> 02:24:47.640
<v Speaker 3>review.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3283
02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:52.820
<v Speaker 3>Because those exist because people want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be told what to buy.</v>

3284
02:24:53.460 --> 02:24:57.840
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to do the work and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>not hating on the audience.</v>

3285
02:24:57.870 --> 02:25:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's busy as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3286
02:25:00.390 --> 02:25:04.020
<v Speaker 3>if you can tune in and find out what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best shit is in five minutes or less,</v>

3287
02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:05.730
<v Speaker 3>so be it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

3288
02:25:05.810 --> 02:25:10.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that the more you take </v>

3289
02:25:10.810 --> 02:25:13.671
<v Speaker 3>your guard down and the more that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>allow for yourself to be programmed to </v>

3290
02:25:13.741 --> 02:25:18.741
<v Speaker 3>respond to those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the less likely that you're going to be </v>

3291
02:25:18.741 --> 02:25:19.080
<v Speaker 3>able to get any kind of accuracy out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3292
02:25:19.770 --> 02:25:21.900
<v Speaker 3>Totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3293
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:23.970
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see what you're saying.</v>

3294
02:25:24.150 --> 02:25:26.530
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly opens up the door to that</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>

3295
02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:29.350
<v Speaker 3>So you've got all these people in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>business calling themselves journalists.</v>

3296
02:25:29.380 --> 02:25:31.990
<v Speaker 3>I've always been against it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always been against it.</v>

3297
02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:34.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you can be a product </v>
<v Speaker 3>journalists,</v>

3298
02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:37.810
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very interesting situation when</v>

3299
02:25:37.811 --> 02:25:39.520
<v Speaker 3>someone's an embedded journalist.</v>

3300
02:25:39.790 --> 02:25:41.350
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what do you mean by embedded?</v>

3301
02:25:41.380 --> 02:25:46.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were also in bed with the company </v>

3302
02:25:46.380 --> 02:25:46.380
<v Speaker 3>that literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3303
02:25:46.380 --> 02:25:46.380
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got it.</v>

3304
02:25:46.380 --> 02:25:46.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3305
02:25:46.380 --> 02:25:51.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's an issue with mixed </v>
<v Speaker 3>martial arts and the ufc has had </v>

3306
02:25:51.551 --> 02:25:55.720
<v Speaker 3>problems with companies that have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>critical of the ufc and it's damaged the</v>

3307
02:25:55.721 --> 02:25:58.780
<v Speaker 3>relationship they have with the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the reporters.</v>

3308
02:25:59.170 --> 02:26:04.170
<v Speaker 3>But if you're a real reporter and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a real opinion that the problem is </v>

3309
02:26:04.601 --> 02:26:09.601
<v Speaker 3>when you work for a corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're an independent like </v>

3310
02:26:09.601 --> 02:26:12.421
<v Speaker 3>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is the responsibility of that </v>

3311
02:26:12.421 --> 02:26:14.941
<v Speaker 3>independent to be completely objective </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's what everybody turns to </v>

3312
02:26:14.941 --> 02:26:15.850
<v Speaker 3>you for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as soon as we can't count on you for</v>

3313
02:26:15.851 --> 02:26:20.851
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole process of having an </v>

3314
02:26:20.851 --> 02:26:21.010
<v Speaker 3>independent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes irrelevant.</v>

3315
02:26:21.230 --> 02:26:22.930
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not an independent.</v>

3316
02:26:22.931 --> 02:26:25.380
<v Speaker 3>You might say you're an independence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're an lg fan boy.</v>

3317
02:26:25.440 --> 02:26:30.440
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt that there is no doubt </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the reason channels like mine have </v>

3318
02:26:30.440 --> 02:26:34.330
<v Speaker 3>successes because we are third parties </v>
<v Speaker 3>because we are not in any meaningful way</v>

3319
02:26:34.331 --> 02:26:35.080
<v Speaker 3>attached to anything.</v>

3320
02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:38.370
<v Speaker 3>And because for the most part we look to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a like,</v>

3321
02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:40.270
<v Speaker 3>like everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like here we are.</v>

3322
02:26:40.271 --> 02:26:45.271
<v Speaker 3>We started a youtube channel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well anybody could start a youtube </v>

3323
02:26:45.271 --> 02:26:45.271
<v Speaker 3>channel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the context helps,</v>

3324
02:26:45.271 --> 02:26:48.931
<v Speaker 3>helps to support the messaging in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is that the further </v>

3325
02:26:48.931 --> 02:26:53.371
<v Speaker 3>along this path you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more important you become and the </v>

3326
02:26:53.371 --> 02:26:53.550
<v Speaker 3>and the treatment changes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3327
02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:56.170
<v Speaker 3>it's like if you were walking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a.</v>

3328
02:26:56.260 --> 02:27:00.640
<v Speaker 3>If you're a really good looking person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lets me bitch to future rogan and you're</v>

3329
02:27:00.641 --> 02:27:02.140
<v Speaker 3>walking around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3330
02:27:02.170 --> 02:27:03.370
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>

3331
02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:05.890
<v Speaker 3>Let's use joe rogan as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just brian red band,</v>

3332
02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:08.320
<v Speaker 3>too late,</v>
<v Speaker 3>too late,</v>

3333
02:27:08.321 --> 02:27:10.210
<v Speaker 3>sexy face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're walking around,</v>

3334
02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:15.540
<v Speaker 3>you get a certain kind of treatment and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that treatment that you get develops </v>

3335
02:27:15.540 --> 02:27:16.360
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't help it.</v>

3336
02:27:16.380 --> 02:27:17.750
<v Speaker 3>So like hot women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hot women,</v>

3337
02:27:17.860 --> 02:27:20.230
<v Speaker 3>women grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a certain amount of worth that</v>

3338
02:27:20.231 --> 02:27:22.900
<v Speaker 3>they attached to themselves because they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are everywhere they go.</v>

3339
02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:25.240
<v Speaker 3>They treated like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like royal hate him for it.</v>

3340
02:27:25.330 --> 02:27:27.610
<v Speaker 3>That's the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're a product of the environment.</v>

3341
02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:32.640
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I can't pretend that I am not a </v>

3342
02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:32.640
<v Speaker 3>product of the environment that I have </v>
<v Speaker 3>to exist within.</v>

3343
02:27:32.640 --> 02:27:36.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just have specIfic rules that I.</v>

3344
02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.010
<v Speaker 3>When I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I engage in,</v>

3345
02:27:39.100 --> 02:27:44.100
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my environments where I have </v>

3346
02:27:44.100 --> 02:27:44.100
<v Speaker 3>privileges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have very specific.</v>

3347
02:27:44.100 --> 02:27:44.740
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's hear about it.</v>

3348
02:27:44.830 --> 02:27:49.830
<v Speaker 3>like martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a huge one because the ufc that I </v>

3349
02:27:49.830 --> 02:27:52.240
<v Speaker 3>work for is the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>greatest mixed martial arts organization</v>

3350
02:27:52.241 --> 02:27:53.440
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

3351
02:27:53.530 --> 02:27:58.530
<v Speaker 3>along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the time that I've been employed </v>

3352
02:27:58.530 --> 02:28:01.771
<v Speaker 3>with them over the past 12 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there have been instances where I've </v>

3353
02:28:01.771 --> 02:28:05.101
<v Speaker 3>actively promoted fighters that were in </v>
<v Speaker 3>other organizations really because I </v>

3354
02:28:05.101 --> 02:28:08.641
<v Speaker 3>liked them because I liked him because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>think they're really good and they </v>

3355
02:28:08.641 --> 02:28:08.641
<v Speaker 3>didn't have to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't pay you anything.</v>

3356
02:28:08.641 --> 02:28:09.250
<v Speaker 3>Not a fucking penny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

3357
02:28:09.251 --> 02:28:10.660
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I have to be honest,</v>

3358
02:28:10.810 --> 02:28:15.810
<v Speaker 3>when fate or amelia danko was in pride,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was one of the best heavyweights in </v>

3359
02:28:15.810 --> 02:28:16.450
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I constantly,</v>

3360
02:28:16.451 --> 02:28:20.320
<v Speaker 3>we talk about him on broadcasts to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>point where like some people didn't like</v>

3361
02:28:20.321 --> 02:28:22.790
<v Speaker 3>it and some people thought it was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>not smart.</v>

3362
02:28:22.791 --> 02:28:24.560
<v Speaker 3>Not over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is smArt.</v>

3363
02:28:24.561 --> 02:28:27.140
<v Speaker 3>You know why it's smart?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I have to be honest,</v>

3364
02:28:27.350 --> 02:28:32.350
<v Speaker 3>if there's some guy out there that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>murdering motherfuckers and some other </v>

3365
02:28:32.350 --> 02:28:35.621
<v Speaker 3>organization and I pretend that the guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have and the only guys that I </v>

3366
02:28:35.621 --> 02:28:39.881
<v Speaker 3>want to see fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's ridiculous that I'm a </v>

3367
02:28:39.881 --> 02:28:39.881
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous person and I don't deserve </v>
<v Speaker 3>that position.</v>

3368
02:28:39.881 --> 02:28:42.500
<v Speaker 3>I completely agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in that same vein,</v>

3369
02:28:42.620 --> 02:28:44.900
<v Speaker 3>isn't it the case with tech reporting </v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

3370
02:28:44.901 --> 02:28:48.110
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do get a very privileged position.</v>

3371
02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:49.340
<v Speaker 3>Lg center,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they you,</v>

3372
02:28:49.350 --> 02:28:51.660
<v Speaker 3>they're sexy new watch and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting all this.</v>

3373
02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:52.760
<v Speaker 3>Let me explain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me,</v>

3374
02:28:53.090 --> 02:28:55.850
<v Speaker 3>let me give you an example of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This phone,</v>

3375
02:28:55.880 --> 02:28:58.340
<v Speaker 3>the most popular single device on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet.</v>

3376
02:28:58.341 --> 02:28:59.600
<v Speaker 3>You paid for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3377
02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:04.490
<v Speaker 3>but this phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this phone specifically is,</v>

3378
02:29:05.850 --> 02:29:06.380
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3379
02:29:06.470 --> 02:29:10.460
<v Speaker 3>it's probably the best way to do an </v>
<v Speaker 3>analysis of the entire market because of</v>

3380
02:29:10.461 --> 02:29:13.940
<v Speaker 3>how popular it is and because of how </v>
<v Speaker 3>important it is as a piece of news,</v>

3381
02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:15.620
<v Speaker 3>iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>iphone,</v>

3382
02:29:15.621 --> 02:29:18.350
<v Speaker 3>iphone five s with little thumbprint </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

3383
02:29:18.351 --> 02:29:20.990
<v Speaker 3>you can use your dick for as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

3384
02:29:20.991 --> 02:29:22.370
<v Speaker 3>I did this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You did.</v>

3385
02:29:22.490 --> 02:29:24.950
<v Speaker 3>And you could spoof it and you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>spoof it with a little bit of wax.</v>

3386
02:29:24.951 --> 02:29:25.710
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who fit?</v>

3387
02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:26.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hack it.</v>

3388
02:29:26.980 --> 02:29:31.880
<v Speaker 3>So chop off somebody's finger and use in</v>
<v Speaker 3>april battery or you could do that.</v>

3389
02:29:31.881 --> 02:29:32.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eight volt battery.</v>

3390
02:29:32.990 --> 02:29:35.780
<v Speaker 3>I think if you catch a person sleeping </v>
<v Speaker 3>and dip their finger in hot wax,</v>

3391
02:29:35.781 --> 02:29:36.660
<v Speaker 3>that will do the job to.</v>

3392
02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:42.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to chop terrible level.</v>

3393
02:29:42.350 --> 02:29:46.310
<v Speaker 3>This device.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This device moves the needle.</v>

3394
02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:51.880
<v Speaker 3>The reason apple doesn't spend as much </v>
<v Speaker 3>money on marketing and samsung because </v>

3395
02:29:51.880 --> 02:29:51.880
<v Speaker 3>they don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This phone comes out.</v>

3396
02:29:51.880 --> 02:29:53.330
<v Speaker 3>It's on the cover in the New York times </v>
<v Speaker 3>has done.</v>

3397
02:29:54.350 --> 02:29:55.520
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3398
02:29:55.580 --> 02:29:57.800
<v Speaker 3>it's the best because there's a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>of reasons though.</v>

3399
02:29:58.150 --> 02:30:00.380
<v Speaker 3>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually not that easy.</v>

3400
02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:02.810
<v Speaker 3>When they are about to launch a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>device.</v>

3401
02:30:03.770 --> 02:30:05.510
<v Speaker 3>They give this out to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They sent it to.</v>

3402
02:30:05.570 --> 02:30:08.480
<v Speaker 3>Apple does send stuff to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Read that to me,</v>

3403
02:30:08.930 --> 02:30:12.260
<v Speaker 3>but to come out to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh god knows.</v>

3404
02:30:12.261 --> 02:30:17.261
<v Speaker 3>I picked some south american traditional</v>
<v Speaker 3>media people fucking business week.</v>

3405
02:30:17.901 --> 02:30:19.220
<v Speaker 3>That kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3406
02:30:19.250 --> 02:30:20.920
<v Speaker 3>Wall street journal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bingo.</v>

3407
02:30:20.930 --> 02:30:23.110
<v Speaker 3>Some fucking crook over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got it.</v>

3408
02:30:25.430 --> 02:30:27.740
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

3409
02:30:27.950 --> 02:30:29.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just noticed that was shot in toronto,</v>

3410
02:30:29.811 --> 02:30:31.190
<v Speaker 3>that jimi hendrix pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

3411
02:30:31.191 --> 02:30:34.460
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got arrested for heroin down there on.</v>

3412
02:30:35.360 --> 02:30:37.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3413
02:30:37.221 --> 02:30:40.190
<v Speaker 3>So a very selective group of people gets</v>
<v Speaker 3>this device,</v>

3414
02:30:40.250 --> 02:30:42.590
<v Speaker 3>then they maintain something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3415
02:30:42.850 --> 02:30:47.850
<v Speaker 3>beside it called the black list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And black list is people who are never </v>

3416
02:30:47.850 --> 02:30:48.290
<v Speaker 3>going to get the device for one reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>or another.</v>

3417
02:30:48.320 --> 02:30:50.610
<v Speaker 3>There are many ways to get on that list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you blacklisted?</v>

3418
02:30:50.660 --> 02:30:55.660
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no public record of the black </v>

3419
02:30:55.660 --> 02:30:55.660
<v Speaker 3>list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just a black list.</v>

3420
02:30:55.660 --> 02:30:56.150
<v Speaker 3>Everyone in business knows that it </v>
<v Speaker 3>exists.</v>

3421
02:30:56.180 --> 02:30:58.310
<v Speaker 3>I want to do a fucking documentary on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this by the way,</v>

3422
02:30:58.340 --> 02:31:01.890
<v Speaker 3>because nobody would watch it except you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your friend that review shit.</v>

3423
02:31:01.950 --> 02:31:03.200
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because apple,</v>

3424
02:31:03.230 --> 02:31:08.230
<v Speaker 3>apple is a giant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like apple affects our lives in ways </v>

3425
02:31:08.230 --> 02:31:09.860
<v Speaker 3>everyone's life in a way that might not </v>
<v Speaker 3>be or I might not be articulating.</v>

3426
02:31:09.890 --> 02:31:13.460
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how does that process work?</v>

3427
02:31:13.461 --> 02:31:15.490
<v Speaker 3>How do they decide who gets that device?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3428
02:31:15.890 --> 02:31:19.260
<v Speaker 3>you would assume that the people with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the biggest audiences maybe would get it</v>

3429
02:31:19.470 --> 02:31:20.100
<v Speaker 3>or maybe just</v>

3430
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:21.720
<v Speaker 2>send it to anybody who wants to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

3431
02:31:21.721 --> 02:31:23.370
<v Speaker 2>You'd think all the exposure would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

3432
02:31:23.480 --> 02:31:28.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well why is it that when this device </v>

3433
02:31:28.480 --> 02:31:31.200
<v Speaker 2>launched like 15 motherfuckers got it </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldwide,</v>

3434
02:31:31.650 --> 02:31:36.650
<v Speaker 2>like a super limited number in inner </v>
<v Speaker 2>circle of reporters because they can </v>

3435
02:31:37.201 --> 02:31:42.201
<v Speaker 2>count on those people to only give </v>
<v Speaker 2>glowing reviews and if those people </v>

3436
02:31:42.201 --> 02:31:46.790
<v Speaker 2>working for whoever decide that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to write something different </v>

3437
02:31:46.790 --> 02:31:51.051
<v Speaker 2>guests where they can find their new </v>
<v Speaker 2>home to blacklist some motherfucking </v>

3438
02:31:51.051 --> 02:31:51.051
<v Speaker 2>black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3439
02:31:51.051 --> 02:31:52.290
<v Speaker 2>but that's their fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whose fault?</v>

3440
02:31:52.440 --> 02:31:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Their fault really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the reason that newspapers doors</v>

3441
02:31:55.861 --> 02:31:57.930
<v Speaker 2>are open is because of the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>device.</v>

3442
02:31:57.990 --> 02:32:02.990
<v Speaker 2>The coverage sells the ads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why newspapers doors is open </v>

3443
02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:04.110
<v Speaker 2>while they're barely fucking burned to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground,</v>

3444
02:32:04.450 --> 02:32:06.930
<v Speaker 2>great fires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but truthfully,</v>

3445
02:32:06.931 --> 02:32:11.931
<v Speaker 2>it's not just the newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's big tech sites that get them as </v>

3446
02:32:11.931 --> 02:32:11.931
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

3447
02:32:11.931 --> 02:32:11.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's a.</v>

3448
02:32:11.931 --> 02:32:15.210
<v Speaker 2>There is a group that gets it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is you have this fear,</v>

3449
02:32:15.330 --> 02:32:20.330
<v Speaker 2>this inherent fear that if you don't do </v>
<v Speaker 2>what the controlling party says to do,</v>

3450
02:32:20.761 --> 02:32:25.761
<v Speaker 2>you don't get that access to the device </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore and unfortunately it's the </v>

3451
02:32:25.761 --> 02:32:28.320
<v Speaker 2>access to the device that drives the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trafficking.</v>

3452
02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Because if you get this review up a week</v>
<v Speaker 2>before anyone else gets what happens to </v>

3453
02:32:33.560 --> 02:32:36.660
<v Speaker 2>everybody else's reviews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens to the value of them dips,</v>

3454
02:32:36.720 --> 02:32:41.720
<v Speaker 2>because the majority of the purchasing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and purchasing decisions are made based </v>

3455
02:32:41.720 --> 02:32:45.531
<v Speaker 2>on the very initial reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how much value is there in a high </v>

3456
02:32:45.531 --> 02:32:49.650
<v Speaker 2>traffic site these days?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Big massive values.</v>

3457
02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:51.800
<v Speaker 2>Fucking you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a site like,</v>

3458
02:32:51.950 --> 02:32:55.620
<v Speaker 2>like ars technica.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a high traffic one?</v>

3459
02:32:55.680 --> 02:32:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big one.</v>

3460
02:32:56.581 --> 02:33:01.581
<v Speaker 2>Diverge is with the verge verge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a guy who writes for one of those is </v>

3461
02:33:02.371 --> 02:33:03.390
<v Speaker 2>going to get access.</v>

3462
02:33:03.400 --> 02:33:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Let me say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me put it this.</v>

3463
02:33:04.380 --> 02:33:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Let me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me say this like this.</v>

3464
02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:10.880
<v Speaker 2>If you're a reporter working at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>verge and you get the task of doing the </v>

3465
02:33:10.880 --> 02:33:10.880
<v Speaker 2>new iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and listen,</v>

3466
02:33:10.880 --> 02:33:14.420
<v Speaker 2>I am not fucking attacking to verge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Iphone is a great phone call,</v>

3467
02:33:14.440 --> 02:33:17.220
<v Speaker 2>arguably the best phone in the market </v>
<v Speaker 2>and nobody really comes out and says,</v>

3468
02:33:17.221 --> 02:33:22.221
<v Speaker 2>shit that's untrue about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking about a potential that </v>

3469
02:33:22.221 --> 02:33:26.061
<v Speaker 2>exists that steers in a direction </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside way outside the world of </v>

3470
02:33:26.061 --> 02:33:30.891
<v Speaker 2>journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't happen when somebody is </v>

3471
02:33:30.891 --> 02:33:32.691
<v Speaker 2>murdered or you're investigating a crime</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you're whatever it is that </v>

3472
02:33:32.691 --> 02:33:36.141
<v Speaker 2>investigative journalism is when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story is something that somebody else </v>

3473
02:33:36.541 --> 02:33:39.540
<v Speaker 2>controls and dishes to only certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>parties.</v>

3474
02:33:39.720 --> 02:33:44.010
<v Speaker 2>There's behavioral patterns that exist </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of that relationship of course,</v>

3475
02:33:44.190 --> 02:33:49.190
<v Speaker 2>and there's also behavioral patterns </v>
<v Speaker 2>that exist in it being financially </v>

3476
02:33:49.190 --> 02:33:50.640
<v Speaker 2>beneficial for you to support certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>

3477
02:33:50.670 --> 02:33:55.670
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is also the psychological </v>

3478
02:33:55.670 --> 02:33:57.561
<v Speaker 2>aspect of knowing that you're on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>elite list of 15 journalists that are </v>

3479
02:33:57.561 --> 02:33:58.200
<v Speaker 2>going to receive a new phone that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be like,</v>

3480
02:33:58.201 --> 02:33:59.760
<v Speaker 2>look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't write that.</v>

3481
02:34:00.020 --> 02:34:01.090
<v Speaker 2>do you think guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

3482
02:34:01.091 --> 02:34:04.070
<v Speaker 2>like really scathing reviews and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>like park them aside and go,</v>

3483
02:34:04.071 --> 02:34:05.190
<v Speaker 2>ha ha ha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was just for fun.</v>

3484
02:34:05.910 --> 02:34:07.740
<v Speaker 2>LeT's suck some dick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

3485
02:34:07.770 --> 02:34:12.770
<v Speaker 2>There's guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's guys that have written stories </v>

3486
02:34:12.770 --> 02:34:12.770
<v Speaker 2>after the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after they've been blacklisted,</v>

3487
02:34:12.770 --> 02:34:13.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about blending the,</v>

3488
02:34:13.700 --> 02:34:15.810
<v Speaker 2>explaining what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I getting a device anymore.</v>

3489
02:34:16.110 --> 02:34:19.210
<v Speaker 2>And the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the verge for example,</v>

3490
02:34:19.211 --> 02:34:20.980
<v Speaker 2>has record page views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The days these,</v>

3491
02:34:21.130 --> 02:34:24.580
<v Speaker 2>these devices launch record page views </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

3492
02:34:24.780 --> 02:34:27.010
<v Speaker 2>So they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to have it early.</v>

3493
02:34:27.340 --> 02:34:32.340
<v Speaker 2>They have to can't the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally people are employed on </v>

3494
02:34:32.340 --> 02:34:36.391
<v Speaker 2>that paycheck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're seeing a percentage that came </v>

3495
02:34:36.391 --> 02:34:37.600
<v Speaker 2>from that fucking report from having </v>
<v Speaker 2>access to that product.</v>

3496
02:34:37.630 --> 02:34:42.630
<v Speaker 2>BuT if you get one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if how much difference would it </v>

3497
02:34:42.630 --> 02:34:44.710
<v Speaker 2>make if you get one of the day comes out</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when everybody is just what I do,</v>

3498

<v Speaker 2>idiot who could junior old school you </v>

<v Speaker 2>for this stuff.</v>

3500

<v Speaker 2>The other stuff I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get early now and the other brands do </v>

02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:57.430
<v Speaker 2>let's get this shit out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3503
02:34:58.120 --> 02:35:01.840
<v Speaker 2>apple fuck note.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their pr team is like,</v>

3504
02:35:01.841 --> 02:35:03.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm definitely blacklisted after this </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

3505
02:35:03.851 --> 02:35:05.460
<v Speaker 2>So are you this podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3506
02:35:05.770 --> 02:35:07.750
<v Speaker 2>Why I'm using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're both using apple products.</v>

3507
02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:09.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm the phones both.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both have.</v>

3508
02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:12.730
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter because I've even </v>
<v Speaker 2>brought up the notion.</v>

3509
02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:16.030
<v Speaker 2>The notion is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's by the apple.</v>

3510
02:35:16.031 --> 02:35:18.910
<v Speaker 2>Engineers write me all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love listening to this show.</v>

3511
02:35:18.911 --> 02:35:20.210
<v Speaker 2>I think we have like this weird shit.</v>

3512
02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just fucked it all up.</v>

3513
02:35:23.291 --> 02:35:26.320
<v Speaker 2>or everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the shit.</v>

3514
02:35:26.321 --> 02:35:31.321
<v Speaker 2>I love the shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the stuff they're making all the </v>

3515
02:35:31.321 --> 02:35:34.351
<v Speaker 2>rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking about people prancing </v>

3516
02:35:34.351 --> 02:35:35.410
<v Speaker 2>around calling themselves journalists </v>
<v Speaker 2>when that's not the reality.</v>

3517
02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:40.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not an open access story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like some shit went down in </v>

3518
02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:42.640
<v Speaker 2>some foreign country and you and another</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy both have the same opportunity to go</v>

3519
02:35:42.641 --> 02:35:45.410
<v Speaker 2>there and investigated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is way different.</v>

3520
02:35:45.430 --> 02:35:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying.</v>

3521
02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:51.720
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely see what you're saying and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when there such a large financial </v>

3522
02:35:51.720 --> 02:35:56.221
<v Speaker 2>benefit to having early access,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when you look at page views </v>

3523
02:35:56.221 --> 02:35:57.970
<v Speaker 2>and things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean when an iphone comes out you have</v>

3524
02:35:57.971 --> 02:36:01.360
<v Speaker 2>essentially 24 to 48 hours where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>were really freaking out.</v>

3525
02:36:01.361 --> 02:36:06.361
<v Speaker 2>RIght.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And during that time that you can </v>

3526
02:36:06.361 --> 02:36:06.361
<v Speaker 2>accumulate millions and millions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hits.</v>

3527
02:36:06.361 --> 02:36:06.361
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3528
02:36:06.361 --> 02:36:07.840
<v Speaker 2>it's tricky shit man.</v>

3529
02:36:07.840 --> 02:36:12.100
<v Speaker 2>But if everybody did it ethically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see with the iphones,</v>

3530
02:36:12.310 --> 02:36:17.310
<v Speaker 2>iphone maybe a bad example because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a stellar product and it's really </v>

3531
02:36:17.310 --> 02:36:19.930
<v Speaker 2>an a uniquely couldn't controlled </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>

3532
02:36:20.140 --> 02:36:21.580
<v Speaker 2>which is what we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier,</v>

3533
02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:24.310
<v Speaker 2>which is their whole argument like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look what we've done.</v>

3534
02:36:24.311 --> 02:36:29.311
<v Speaker 2>Like the reason why we have this </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled environment is that we put </v>

3535
02:36:29.311 --> 02:36:30.520
<v Speaker 2>together the hardware we put together </v>
<v Speaker 2>the operating system,</v>

3536
02:36:30.521 --> 02:36:33.610
<v Speaker 2>we make everything compatible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uses nothing that fucks up.</v>

3537
02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:34.900
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why?</v>

3538
02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:39.960
<v Speaker 2>But why are they sending out 15 units if</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know their shit is bad ass because </v>

3539
02:36:39.960 --> 02:36:39.960
<v Speaker 2>you're tired of your bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

3540
02:36:40.210 --> 02:36:45.210
<v Speaker 2>Tardy fucking snarky comments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are there because they deep down </v>

3541
02:36:45.790 --> 02:36:50.590
<v Speaker 2>they are fucking masterminds that </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlling public relations.</v>

3542
02:36:50.680 --> 02:36:53.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mastermind climate.</v>

3543
02:36:53.561 --> 02:36:58.561
<v Speaker 2>Any different with tim cook as opposed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to a steve jobs fanboy alert.</v>

3544
02:36:58.680 --> 02:37:00.520
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's the ceo of apple?</v>

3545
02:37:00.820 --> 02:37:01.450
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty good.</v>

3546
02:37:01.730 --> 02:37:06.730
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that I can accurately </v>

3547
02:37:06.730 --> 02:37:06.730
<v Speaker 2>answer that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3548
02:37:06.730 --> 02:37:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I think people always say that's under </v>
<v Speaker 2>steve's influence.</v>

3549
02:37:08.261 --> 02:37:10.890
<v Speaker 2>They had product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got guidelines,</v>

3550
02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:14.260
<v Speaker 2>forecasts for way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way after his death.</v>

3551
02:37:14.650 --> 02:37:19.650
<v Speaker 2>So I think they're probably still </v>
<v Speaker 2>executing on stuff that he had in the </v>

3552
02:37:19.650 --> 02:37:19.650
<v Speaker 2>pipeline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a fucking maniac.</v>

3553
02:37:19.650 --> 02:37:24.411
<v Speaker 2>That guy was definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there was an article at some </v>

3554
02:37:24.531 --> 02:37:28.400
<v Speaker 2>billionaire investor guy dumped all his </v>
<v Speaker 2>apple stock after you read the biography</v>

3555
02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:30.800
<v Speaker 2>because he said steve jobs as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>

3556
02:37:31.250 --> 02:37:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably swipe.</v>

3557
02:37:33.170 --> 02:37:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Dumped it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should pull that up is because it's a </v>

3558
02:37:38.170 --> 02:37:41.380
<v Speaker 2>fascinating story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's pretty hard to manage a </v>

3559
02:37:41.380 --> 02:37:41.380
<v Speaker 2>company of that stature and not be an </v>
<v Speaker 2>asshole.</v>

3560
02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta think about what is an average</v>

3561
02:37:45.141 --> 02:37:48.380
<v Speaker 2>person's life and average person's life </v>
<v Speaker 2>is you have a job,</v>

3562
02:37:48.381 --> 02:37:50.840
<v Speaker 2>but you also have like a fucking family </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of other shit you do.</v>

3563
02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:52.760
<v Speaker 2>Your job is not your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3564
02:37:52.820 --> 02:37:57.200
<v Speaker 2>To steve jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apple was his whole fucking life and his</v>

3565
02:37:57.201 --> 02:37:59.060
<v Speaker 2>personal life suffered because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3566
02:37:59.061 --> 02:37:59.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3567
02:37:59.661 --> 02:38:01.880
<v Speaker 2>that's probably had something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 2>his health as well.</v>

3568
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:05.840
<v Speaker 2>Probably no investor drop dumps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apple stock.</v>

3569
02:38:06.050 --> 02:38:07.550
<v Speaker 2>I need to get one of these nexus phones </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

3570
02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:12.560
<v Speaker 2>Now I can't stop thinking that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may never have ever used the actual </v>

3571
02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:16.181
<v Speaker 2>fucking operating dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can find clips of the even newer </v>

3572
02:38:16.181 --> 02:38:16.700
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're calling it l.</v>

3573
02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:19.790
<v Speaker 2>I saw the saw the dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks so beautiful.</v>

3574
02:38:20.270 --> 02:38:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Just the way they're looking at design </v>
<v Speaker 2>and working with dimensions up and down.</v>

3575
02:38:23.661 --> 02:38:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Now is the next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3576
02:38:25.620 --> 02:38:27.450
<v Speaker 2>is that five?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is fine.</v>

3577
02:38:27.451 --> 02:38:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the nexus five.</v>

3578
02:38:28.551 --> 02:38:33.551
<v Speaker 2>They only one that does that or this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody like sony or somebody running </v>

3579
02:38:33.551 --> 02:38:36.791
<v Speaker 2>four point four percent for it now is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just the nexus will always get updates </v>

3580
02:38:36.791 --> 02:38:37.120
<v Speaker 2>first because it doesn't have to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the carrier.</v>

3581
02:38:37.121 --> 02:38:39.140
<v Speaker 2>This isn't unlock device.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Completely open.</v>

3582
02:38:40.020 --> 02:38:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>

3583
02:38:40.660 --> 02:38:43.660
<v Speaker 1>This guy's name was julian robertson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's number five.</v>

3584
02:38:43.661 --> 02:38:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three on forbes billionaire list and cnn</v>

3585
02:38:47.201 --> 02:38:49.660
<v Speaker 1>reported monday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is while ago.</v>

3586
02:38:49.661 --> 02:38:54.661
<v Speaker 1>this was way back in 2013 and october,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right after the book came out that the </v>

3587
02:38:54.661 --> 02:38:57.730
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this hedge fund investor sold all of his</v>

3588
02:38:57.910 --> 02:39:01.910
<v Speaker 1>shares in apple because he's read the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biography of steve jobs and uh,</v>

3589
02:39:02.170 --> 02:39:07.170
<v Speaker 1>decided that apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the founder of apple was a really awful </v>

3590
02:39:07.170 --> 02:39:10.711
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He admits this stock did very well for </v>

3591
02:39:10.711 --> 02:39:14.461
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he would rather let someone else </v>

3592
02:39:14.461 --> 02:39:15.400
<v Speaker 1>make the money from now on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the cnn investment show,</v>

3593
02:39:15.401 --> 02:39:16.240
<v Speaker 1>closing bell,</v>

3594
02:39:16.400 --> 02:39:19.730
<v Speaker 2>see even that I'm off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always skeptical of that whole.</v>

3595
02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:25.660
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying it caused a crisis of </v>

3596
02:39:25.660 --> 02:39:25.660
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3597
02:39:25.940 --> 02:39:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy who's worth billions saying </v>

3598
02:39:30.940 --> 02:39:34.271
<v Speaker 1>anything it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came to the conclusion that it was </v>

3599
02:39:34.271 --> 02:39:36.710
<v Speaker 1>unlikely that a man as really awful as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think steve jobs was,</v>

3600
02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:39.980
<v Speaker 1>could possibly create a great company </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the long term.</v>

3601
02:39:40.430 --> 02:39:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I just don't believe that bad guys do </v>
<v Speaker 1>well in the long run.</v>

3602
02:39:43.930 --> 02:39:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who fucking wrote that book though?</v>

3603
02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:48.670
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does he.</v>

3604
02:39:48.730 --> 02:39:50.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how well does he know steve jobs?</v>

3605
02:39:50.691 --> 02:39:55.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you can decide to paint us a </v>

3606
02:39:55.691 --> 02:40:00.100
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know your best friend all the </v>

3607
02:40:00.100 --> 02:40:02.741
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know him when you're hanging around </v>

3608
02:40:02.741 --> 02:40:04.661
<v Speaker 1>with true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of times when people are </v>

3609
02:40:04.661 --> 02:40:06.761
<v Speaker 1>alone like to paint a portrait of steve </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs without a deeply intimate </v>

3610
02:40:06.761 --> 02:40:10.460
<v Speaker 1>relationship with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you could go all sorts of ways.</v>

3611
02:40:10.461 --> 02:40:15.461
<v Speaker 1>You could go the way of these 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies that their apple phones in </v>

3612
02:40:15.461 --> 02:40:18.150
<v Speaker 1>advance and paint this really glowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glamorous picture,</v>

3613
02:40:18.151 --> 02:40:21.570
<v Speaker 1>or you could just paint some picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you think is going to sell a lot of</v>

3614
02:40:21.571 --> 02:40:22.280
<v Speaker 1>fucking books.</v>

3615
02:40:22.430 --> 02:40:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Scathing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awful depiction of.</v>

3616
02:40:25.470 --> 02:40:28.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like you ever watch a historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>depiction,</v>

3617
02:40:28.651 --> 02:40:32.080
<v Speaker 1>like a historical documentary like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lincoln received the show.</v>

3618
02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:33.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is,</v>

3619
02:40:33.511 --> 02:40:35.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people didn't really say that.</v>

3620
02:40:35.160 --> 02:40:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3621
02:40:35.791 --> 02:40:36.350
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3622
02:40:36.351 --> 02:40:41.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they dIdn't say that in that arthur </v>

3623
02:40:41.351 --> 02:40:41.940
<v Speaker 1>reenacted or so when you have like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>book on steve jobs,</v>

3624
02:40:41.941 --> 02:40:46.941
<v Speaker 1>life mean you have some vague facts that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't maybe know the tire </v>

3625
02:40:47.431 --> 02:40:50.250
<v Speaker 1>circumstAnces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the context of the conversations.</v>

3626
02:40:50.610 --> 02:40:51.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3627
02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:54.240
<v Speaker 1>you're flavoring things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have facts you can't,</v>

3628
02:40:54.241 --> 02:40:59.241
<v Speaker 1>and then you're throwing those flat </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts in and pouring your own colors on </v>

3629
02:40:59.241 --> 02:41:02.280
<v Speaker 1>them and your own shapes to paint your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own picture.</v>

3630
02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:03.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3631
02:41:03.530 --> 02:41:05.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of wonder though.</v>

3632
02:41:05.450 --> 02:41:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting back,</v>

3633
02:41:06.271 --> 02:41:09.600
<v Speaker 1>getting back to the asshole comment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the movies and stuff as well.</v>

3634
02:41:09.900 --> 02:41:12.660
<v Speaker 1>He'll come in and fire somebody in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of everyone else.</v>

3635
02:41:12.930 --> 02:41:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

3636
02:41:13.381 --> 02:41:15.750
<v Speaker 1>This guy's an idiot because listen to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of his quote.</v>

3637
02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:20.800
<v Speaker 1>an interesting twist of logic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robertson also said that a steve jobs </v>

3638
02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:21.330
<v Speaker 1>was still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd still be an apple investor.</v>

3639
02:41:21.360 --> 02:41:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he said,</v>

3640
02:41:22.921 --> 02:41:27.070
<v Speaker 1>after watching the ashton kutcher movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought steve jobs was sexy as though</v>

3641
02:41:27.310 --> 02:41:29.510
<v Speaker 1>you didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even steve jobs is.</v>

3642
02:41:29.511 --> 02:41:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Ashton kutcher says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no question in that.</v>

3643
02:41:31.651 --> 02:41:33.150
<v Speaker 1>He's the man who killed three and a half</v>
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>

3644
02:41:33.330 --> 02:41:34.550
<v Speaker 1>What does that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two and a half years,</v>

3645
02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:38.130
<v Speaker 1>they're all fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a billionaire.</v>

3646
02:41:38.131 --> 02:41:40.160
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do any interviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just be bawling.</v>

3647
02:41:40.300 --> 02:41:43.770
<v Speaker 1>I just be flying around in spaceships </v>
<v Speaker 1>and throwing champagne of people.</v>

3648
02:41:43.980 --> 02:41:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Why would you even do interviews?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I sold my apple stock fall 90 </v>

3649
02:41:49.830 --> 02:41:54.830
<v Speaker 1>fucking old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The objective there is to influence the </v>

3650
02:41:54.830 --> 02:41:54.830
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

3651
02:41:54.830 --> 02:41:54.830
<v Speaker 1>That's what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3652
02:41:54.830 --> 02:41:59.710
<v Speaker 1>so that I can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're that big and you hold that </v>

3653
02:41:59.710 --> 02:42:02.730
<v Speaker 1>much stock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your behavior affects so many things.</v>

3654
02:42:02.731 --> 02:42:04.000
<v Speaker 1>He might be hedging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3655
02:42:04.020 --> 02:42:05.920
<v Speaker 1>we don't know how much stock you had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3656
02:42:05.940 --> 02:42:06.870
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's sold his stock.</v>

3657
02:42:06.871 --> 02:42:08.330
<v Speaker 1>We know he's a billionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

3658
02:42:08.340 --> 02:42:11.940
<v Speaker 1>He probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could afford to influence the market.</v>

3659
02:42:14.700 --> 02:42:16.860
<v Speaker 1>This is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3660
02:42:16.861 --> 02:42:17.910
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>

3661
02:42:17.940 --> 02:42:19.560
<v Speaker 1>but nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>

3662
02:42:19.590 --> 02:42:21.170
<v Speaker 1>nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it took.</v>

3663
02:42:21.210 --> 02:42:26.210
<v Speaker 1>I find the stock market to be a bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>place because you're talking about the </v>

3664
02:42:26.210 --> 02:42:28.680
<v Speaker 1>evaluatIon of a company and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>impacted by confidence.</v>

3665
02:42:29.490 --> 02:42:31.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking ski to ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>scheme.</v>

3666
02:42:31.980 --> 02:42:35.520
<v Speaker 1>So one of the weirdest methods of </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling an economy ever.</v>

3667
02:42:35.521 --> 02:42:38.790
<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that it's actually what we rely</v>

3668
02:42:38.791 --> 02:42:39.300
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3669
02:42:39.570 --> 02:42:42.540
<v Speaker 1>That's confidence games that like those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things have stock,</v>

3670
02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:46.470
<v Speaker 1>those fucking those movies of wall </v>
<v Speaker 1>street where people are on the floor and</v>

3671
02:42:48.150 --> 02:42:53.150
<v Speaker 1>like that's the underlying system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps foundation on your table and your </v>

3672
02:42:55.471 --> 02:42:58.720
<v Speaker 1>mortgage paid roof over your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goofy antics.</v>

3673
02:42:58.721 --> 02:43:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Shit's so crazy and that's that some </v>
<v Speaker 1>archaic shit that may be worked out with</v>

3674
02:43:03.211 --> 02:43:07.520
<v Speaker 1>something like bitcoin that like when </v>
<v Speaker 1>digital currency starts taking over,</v>

3675
02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:12.250
<v Speaker 1>we have a sort of a different idea of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monetized value</v>

3676
02:43:12.610 --> 02:43:14.350
<v Speaker 3>because of digital currency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It could.</v>

3677
02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:17.740
<v Speaker 3>That could be something that eventually </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets reworked as well.</v>

3678
02:43:17.741 --> 02:43:18.250
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3679
02:43:18.251 --> 02:43:23.251
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you have to worry about the </v>

3680
02:43:23.251 --> 02:43:25.270
<v Speaker 3>financial companies getting a hold of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'll do it.</v>

3681
02:43:25.310 --> 02:43:30.310
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that that in that sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's one of the reasons why </v>

3682
02:43:30.310 --> 02:43:31.300
<v Speaker 3>transparency is a good idea because </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are,</v>

3683
02:43:31.330 --> 02:43:35.440
<v Speaker 3>who do have ulterior motives and obvious</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad attentions,</v>

3684
02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:40.920
<v Speaker 3>financial intentions and bad social </v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of transparency to like to </v>

3685
02:43:40.920 --> 02:43:43.750
<v Speaker 3>what degree will transfer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a good question because I,</v>

3686
02:43:43.790 --> 02:43:47.230
<v Speaker 3>because because you were mentioning </v>
<v Speaker 3>earlier that you are transparent.</v>

3687
02:43:47.231 --> 02:43:48.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying I'm transparent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

3688
02:43:48.971 --> 02:43:51.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily share everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

3689
02:43:51.940 --> 02:43:53.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3690
02:43:53.020 --> 02:43:58.020
<v Speaker 3>There's a level of transparency that </v>
<v Speaker 3>makes sense and then at some point it </v>

3691
02:43:58.020 --> 02:43:58.020
<v Speaker 3>gets weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3692
02:43:58.020 --> 02:43:59.170
<v Speaker 3>Like if a financial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a finance guy had to,</v>

3693
02:44:00.310 --> 02:44:05.310
<v Speaker 3>if we were able to grasp the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>money these fucking guys are making by </v>

3694
02:44:05.310 --> 02:44:07.710
<v Speaker 3>trading one inanimate thing for another </v>
<v Speaker 3>anatomy thing,</v>

3695
02:44:08.110 --> 02:44:10.660
<v Speaker 3>I don't think society would be very </v>
<v Speaker 3>happy about it.</v>

3696
02:44:11.110 --> 02:44:12.790
<v Speaker 3>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3697
02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:17.500
<v Speaker 3>like it's essentially a gambling ring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like so many of these hedge funds now.</v>

3698
02:44:17.530 --> 02:44:19.780
<v Speaker 3>it's not even about investing in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>company you believe in.</v>

3699
02:44:19.781 --> 02:44:24.781
<v Speaker 3>It's in making a play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's one of the reasons why the </v>

3700
02:44:24.781 --> 02:44:26.140
<v Speaker 3>bernie madoff situation was so confusing</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was like,</v>

3701
02:44:26.170 --> 02:44:27.490
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this guy,</v>

3702
02:44:27.730 --> 02:44:31.530
<v Speaker 3>he was involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3703
02:44:31.600 --> 02:44:36.600
<v Speaker 3>people that were incredibly rich and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was moving their money and he was doing </v>

3704
02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:40.771
<v Speaker 3>it in full view of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like he had a huge business </v>

3705
02:44:40.771 --> 02:44:42.530
<v Speaker 3>building a whole floor man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3706
02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:47.260
<v Speaker 3>you watch them move money around and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these billionaires and millionaires were</v>

3707
02:44:47.261 --> 02:44:50.650
<v Speaker 3>investing with him and he did it in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of everybody.</v>

3708
02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:52.000
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

3709
02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:55.000
<v Speaker 3>that exposes the entire system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about the crash?</v>

3710
02:44:55.300 --> 02:44:56.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about the bailout?</v>

3711
02:44:56.740 --> 02:44:57.840
<v Speaker 3>What about the bail?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3712
02:44:57.990 --> 02:45:00.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was in front of all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's all so crazy.</v>

3713
02:45:00.880 --> 02:45:04.060
<v Speaker 3>It's also crazy and I think that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the news,</v>

3714
02:45:04.061 --> 02:45:09.061
<v Speaker 3>like the evening news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of things we're dealing with </v>

3715
02:45:09.061 --> 02:45:13.320
<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're dealing with these forgotten </v>

3716
02:45:13.320 --> 02:45:14.440
<v Speaker 3>relics or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not forgotten,</v>

3717
02:45:14.441 --> 02:45:19.441
<v Speaker 3>but current relics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>young of an age where they're not </v>

3718
02:45:19.441 --> 02:45:19.441
<v Speaker 3>relevant anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just there.</v>

3719
02:45:19.441 --> 02:45:21.130
<v Speaker 3>The ideas behind them that make them </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't relevant.</v>

3720
02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:26.160
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they've also been compromised to a </v>

3721
02:45:26.160 --> 02:45:26.890
<v Speaker 3>point where they're so unstable when it </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes to things like the stock market.</v>

3722
02:45:27.070 --> 02:45:29.230
<v Speaker 3>When you look at derivatives and I tried</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

3723
02:45:29.260 --> 02:45:31.990
<v Speaker 3>peter schIff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to explain to riveting to me and,</v>

3724
02:45:31.991 --> 02:45:33.610
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3725
02:45:33.660 --> 02:45:38.660
<v Speaker 3>the how people bet on things failing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying there is in that </v>

3726
02:45:39.071 --> 02:45:44.071
<v Speaker 3>aspect of the economy and it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>bewildering that anybody ever let that </v>

3727
02:45:44.071 --> 02:45:45.790
<v Speaker 3>happen and it's not about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not about what makes sense.</v>

3728
02:45:45.850 --> 02:45:48.670
<v Speaker 3>It's about what you can convince people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that that's the problem.</v>

3729
02:45:48.670 --> 02:45:50.830
<v Speaker 3>It's much like a betting line on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

3730
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:52.300
<v Speaker 3>ufc fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

3731
02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:56.140
<v Speaker 3>it's the vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not necessarily about you.</v>

3732
02:45:56.310 --> 02:45:58.930
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to one of your fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>broadcast.</v>

3733
02:45:58.931 --> 02:46:03.931
<v Speaker 3>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were saying you had a great record </v>

3734
02:46:03.931 --> 02:46:03.931
<v Speaker 3>picking winners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3735
02:46:03.931 --> 02:46:04.030
<v Speaker 3>but you will never say it or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

3736
02:46:04.050 --> 02:46:06.910
<v Speaker 3>but I never give predictions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to give predictions,</v>

3737
02:46:06.911 --> 02:46:10.010
<v Speaker 3>but I would imagine be being who you </v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

3738
02:46:10.011 --> 02:46:12.230
<v Speaker 3>that you can fairly accurately predict </v>
<v Speaker 3>winners.</v>

3739
02:46:12.231 --> 02:46:13.250
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Over And over again.</v>

3740
02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:15.230
<v Speaker 3>Pretty accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not 100 percent.</v>

3741
02:46:15.231 --> 02:46:17.210
<v Speaker 3>There's certain fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like here's a perfect example.</v>

3742
02:46:17.211 --> 02:46:19.400
<v Speaker 3>Well name one that you got surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3743
02:46:19.401 --> 02:46:20.780
<v Speaker 3>I get surprised all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3744
02:46:20.781 --> 02:46:23.000
<v Speaker 3>so this weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anderson silva surprised me.</v>

3745
02:46:23.450 --> 02:46:25.550
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was going to give him some </v>
<v Speaker 3>troubles,</v>

3746
02:46:25.580 --> 02:46:30.580
<v Speaker 3>but I never thought he would win by </v>
<v Speaker 3>knockout in the first round or the </v>

3747
02:46:30.580 --> 02:46:30.650
<v Speaker 3>second round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fight surprised any.</v>

3748
02:46:31.740 --> 02:46:32.540
<v Speaker 3>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was no way,</v>

3749
02:46:32.541 --> 02:46:37.541
<v Speaker 3>but I guess you don't necessarily need </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be perfect in order to make a lot of </v>

3750
02:46:37.541 --> 02:46:37.541
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tj dillashaw,</v>

3751
02:46:37.541 --> 02:46:39.040
<v Speaker 3>hanan barao.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's another one at hidden brown,</v>

3752
02:46:39.120 --> 02:46:42.890
<v Speaker 3>one of the best fighters on the planet </v>
<v Speaker 3>or a tj dillashaw dominates him for five</v>

3753
02:46:42.891 --> 02:46:45.240
<v Speaker 3>rounds and then head kicks him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3754
02:46:45.241 --> 02:46:46.280
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

3755
02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:47.380
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a.</v>

3756
02:46:47.630 --> 02:46:50.090
<v Speaker 3>It's not a science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that being said,</v>

3757
02:46:50.091 --> 02:46:55.091
<v Speaker 3>I think you could knock it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>park a good enough percentage of the </v>

3758
02:46:55.091 --> 02:46:55.091
<v Speaker 3>time to make a killing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3759
02:46:55.091 --> 02:46:57.320
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I wanted to bet money on fights every</v>

3760
02:46:57.320 --> 02:46:57.980
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm saying.</v>

3761
02:46:58.010 --> 02:47:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>What could make solar so the law,</v>

3762
02:47:00.620 --> 02:47:04.040
<v Speaker 3>the lIne that they draw is based on what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can sell.</v>

3763
02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:08.030
<v Speaker 3>So it's relative to what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To the bedding that's already occurring.</v>

3764
02:47:08.060 --> 02:47:09.380
<v Speaker 3>That's why the line moves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3765
02:47:10.100 --> 02:47:11.840
<v Speaker 3>It's no different in the stock market.</v>

3766
02:47:11.840 --> 02:47:14.150
<v Speaker 3>If you can convince people that have </v>
<v Speaker 3>stock is valuable,</v>

3767
02:47:14.151 --> 02:47:15.260
<v Speaker 3>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's valuable.</v>

3768
02:47:15.410 --> 02:47:17.720
<v Speaker 3>Do you think is unethical?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I bet on fights,</v>

3769
02:47:17.780 --> 02:47:21.350
<v Speaker 3>I can't affect the outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I bet on fights myself,</v>

3770
02:47:21.470 --> 02:47:24.830
<v Speaker 3>if I decided to do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think so.</v>

3771
02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:26.480
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

3772
02:47:26.510 --> 02:47:28.400
<v Speaker 3>This is breaking news right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>joe rogan.</v>

3773
02:47:29.010 --> 02:47:29.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

3774
02:47:29.841 --> 02:47:33.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm not a player player or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>coach.</v>

3775
02:47:33.350 --> 02:47:36.140
<v Speaker 3>Then I would think that betting on </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights can be very problematic.</v>

3776
02:47:36.141 --> 02:47:38.180
<v Speaker 3>Contact you have contact with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighters.</v>

3777
02:47:38.790 --> 02:47:42.590
<v Speaker 3>That insider trading that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3778
02:47:43.010 --> 02:47:48.010
<v Speaker 3>I would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should have your own show on </v>

3779
02:47:48.010 --> 02:47:48.010
<v Speaker 3>youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like who was that guy that got ousted?</v>

3780
02:47:48.010 --> 02:47:49.730
<v Speaker 3>He used to be the bedding machine and </v>
<v Speaker 3>football.</v>

3781
02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:51.020
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greek champion.</v>

3782
02:47:51.021 --> 02:47:51.710
<v Speaker 3>The greek.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3783
02:47:51.711 --> 02:47:54.170
<v Speaker 3>but that was because he was racist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't even racist.</v>

3784
02:47:54.171 --> 02:47:56.670
<v Speaker 3>He was just kInd of being accurate about</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they used to breed slaves.</v>

3785
02:47:57.950 --> 02:47:58.890
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

3786
02:47:58.970 --> 02:48:03.970
<v Speaker 3>So fucking exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he had a segment on national tv </v>

3787
02:48:03.970 --> 02:48:04.280
<v Speaker 3>about bedding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3788
02:48:04.281 --> 02:48:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Like people care,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3789
02:48:05.960 --> 02:48:10.960
<v Speaker 3>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>many people would watch a show of you </v>

3790
02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:11.330
<v Speaker 3>giving your pics on an upcoming event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too mean.</v>

3791
02:48:11.410 --> 02:48:13.280
<v Speaker 3>It's too rude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is it rude?</v>

3792
02:48:13.310 --> 02:48:14.840
<v Speaker 3>It's rude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been rude before.</v>

3793
02:48:14.841 --> 02:48:16.700
<v Speaker 3>Pull up kimbo slice versus seth </v>
<v Speaker 3>prejudice.</v>

3794
02:48:16.701 --> 02:48:17.960
<v Speaker 3>Ellie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>

3795
02:48:18.010 --> 02:48:20.630
<v Speaker 3>We were in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a perfect example of it.</v>

3796
02:48:20.631 --> 02:48:25.631
<v Speaker 3>We were backstage in atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was working at the punchline in </v>

3797
02:48:25.631 --> 02:48:30.281
<v Speaker 3>atlanta and while we were there it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>when elite ecc was on tv and ken </v>

3798
02:48:30.471 --> 02:48:32.390
<v Speaker 3>shamrock was supposed to fight kimbo </v>
<v Speaker 3>slice,</v>

3799
02:48:32.540 --> 02:48:37.540
<v Speaker 3>but ken shamrock got cut backstage like </v>
<v Speaker 3>while he's warming up and the doctors </v>

3800
02:48:37.540 --> 02:48:39.470
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't let him fight so because it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be on tv.</v>

3801
02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:44.800
<v Speaker 3>Seth pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee who was on earlier on in the card </v>

3802
02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:44.800
<v Speaker 3>already been approved by athletic </v>
<v Speaker 3>commission,</v>

3803
02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:49.121
<v Speaker 3>already made weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>decided to fight kimbo in the main </v>

3804
02:48:49.121 --> 02:48:49.121
<v Speaker 3>event.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had already fought that night?</v>

3805
02:48:49.121 --> 02:48:49.150
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3806
02:48:49.170 --> 02:48:50.430
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Approved to fight.</v>

3807
02:48:50.600 --> 02:48:52.190
<v Speaker 3>It all happened that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>

3808
02:48:52.191 --> 02:48:57.191
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they rearranged the car that day of </v>

3809
02:48:57.191 --> 02:48:57.191
<v Speaker 3>the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They paid the other guy money.</v>

3810
02:48:57.191 --> 02:48:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Got a got kimbo to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seth.</v>

3811
02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:02.680
<v Speaker 3>Ellie got it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we're backstage and I found out </v>

3812
02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:02.680
<v Speaker 3>about it literally as it was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3813
02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:04.390
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seth petrocelli's gonna.</v>

3814
02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:08.190
<v Speaker 3>Fuck him up and then the fight happens </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it literally six seconds of seth</v>

3815
02:49:08.190 --> 02:49:10.050
<v Speaker 1>veggies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ellie knocks him out and I was like,</v>

3816
02:49:10.051 --> 02:49:12.210
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you where it is.</v>

3817
02:49:12.670 --> 02:49:16.990
<v Speaker 7>Play it petro silly,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but is this the fight?</v>

3818
02:49:16.991 --> 02:49:18.250
<v Speaker 7>Is this me watching the fight?</v>

3819
02:49:18.810 --> 02:49:23.810
<v Speaker 1>This is not me watching the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull up the video of me predicting it </v>

3820
02:49:23.810 --> 02:49:27.470
<v Speaker 1>because I predicted and we were watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>it backstage as it was happening on the </v>

3821
02:49:27.470 --> 02:49:28.590
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very mean because I was like,</v>

3822
02:49:28.591 --> 02:49:30.300
<v Speaker 1>seth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure is always going to fuck him up,</v>

3823
02:49:30.301 --> 02:49:31.210
<v Speaker 1>but I like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3824
02:49:31.230 --> 02:49:36.230
<v Speaker 1>he's a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I felt bad after I said it even </v>

3825
02:49:36.230 --> 02:49:39.741
<v Speaker 1>though I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the weird thing about fighting </v>

3826
02:49:39.741 --> 02:49:40.950
<v Speaker 1>that when it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on the ground in bloody.</v>

3827
02:49:41.130 --> 02:49:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

3828
02:49:42.620 --> 02:49:44.660
<v Speaker 7>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's a last minute replacement.</v>

3829
02:49:44.890 --> 02:49:46.690
<v Speaker 7>Got to parts of san francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's gonna.</v>

3830
02:49:46.710 --> 02:49:49.470
<v Speaker 7>Fuck him up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If I'm wrong,</v>

3831
02:49:49.471 --> 02:49:54.471
<v Speaker 7>you never see this sitting backstage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What's wrong with it?</v>

3832
02:49:57.250 --> 02:50:02.250
<v Speaker 7>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Watch how fast.</v>

3833
02:50:13.410 --> 02:50:15.020
<v Speaker 7>I felt bad</v>

3834
02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:15.910
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3835
02:50:15.911 --> 02:50:18.010
<v Speaker 1>I probably shouldn't do I look in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

3836
02:50:18.011 --> 02:50:18.800
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>TattooS,</v>

3837
02:50:19.750 --> 02:50:20.720
<v Speaker 1>beard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3838
02:50:20.950 --> 02:50:21.540
<v Speaker 1>sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>BeArd.</v>

3839
02:50:21.541 --> 02:50:25.960
<v Speaker 1>But I looked very intoxicating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3840
02:50:25.961 --> 02:50:28.000
<v Speaker 1>you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were motivated at the time.</v>

3841
02:50:28.001 --> 02:50:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I think he was a lIttle more composure </v>
<v Speaker 1>will not only was I motivated,</v>

3842
02:50:32.681 --> 02:50:33.890
<v Speaker 1>it was in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3843
02:50:34.380 --> 02:50:37.890
<v Speaker 1>I got offstage quite yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3844
02:50:37.950 --> 02:50:38.950
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

3845
02:50:38.951 --> 02:50:42.190
<v Speaker 1>So I literally had just gotten off stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>and boom,</v>

3846
02:50:42.230 --> 02:50:44.320
<v Speaker 1>you're in the dressing room and oh they </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't fought yet.</v>

3847
02:50:44.321 --> 02:50:49.321
<v Speaker 1>And black seth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's gonna find out and then we made </v>

3848
02:50:49.321 --> 02:50:51.871
<v Speaker 1>the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if with a little more preparation </v>

3849
02:50:51.871 --> 02:50:52.720
<v Speaker 1>you could phrase it in a way that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>insulting.</v>

3850
02:50:52.721 --> 02:50:57.721
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well my partner at on it opry is an act </v>

3851
02:50:57.721 --> 02:50:57.730
<v Speaker 1>active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Better undermined.</v>

3852
02:50:57.750 --> 02:51:02.750
<v Speaker 1>I heard him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard him betting on one of the fight </v>

3853
02:51:02.750 --> 02:51:02.800
<v Speaker 1>broadcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very strong average,</v>

3854
02:51:02.801 --> 02:51:04.330
<v Speaker 1>like well into the 80 percent.</v>

3855
02:51:04.330 --> 02:51:05.920
<v Speaker 1>At one point in time we were at 90 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

3856
02:51:06.540 --> 02:51:09.310
<v Speaker 1>We've gone full cards where we are 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent correct.</v>

3857
02:51:09.610 --> 02:51:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3858
02:51:11.110 --> 02:51:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He fucking doing this page.</v>

3859
02:51:14.380 --> 02:51:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're 90 percent,</v>

3860
02:51:16.450 --> 02:51:18.530
<v Speaker 1>you need to be spending some money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3861
02:51:18.760 --> 02:51:21.290
<v Speaker 1>because I would get addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is this,</v>

3862
02:51:21.310 --> 02:51:23.050
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why don't gamble on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3863
02:51:23.051 --> 02:51:25.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I worried it would affect </v>
<v Speaker 1>my commentary because I absolutely would</v>

3864
02:51:25.811 --> 02:51:30.811
<v Speaker 1>not let it sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been accused of being biased </v>

3865
02:51:30.811 --> 02:51:32.971
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I am biased because I enjoy </v>

3866
02:51:32.971 --> 02:51:33.160
<v Speaker 1>certain styles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not biased because I want</v>

3867
02:51:33.161 --> 02:51:38.161
<v Speaker 1>one person to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I juSt think I like when people fIght </v>

3868
02:51:38.161 --> 02:51:38.800
<v Speaker 1>effectively in an intelligent way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that.</v>

3869
02:51:39.160 --> 02:51:44.160
<v Speaker 1>I like when people are exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked when I have like very specific </v>

3870
02:51:44.160 --> 02:51:46.210
<v Speaker 1>things that I like about the sport of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting and one of them is I,</v>

3871
02:51:46.211 --> 02:51:50.680
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy technique and someone who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real technician,</v>

3872
02:51:50.681 --> 02:51:53.390
<v Speaker 1>a craftsman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody really immerses himself.</v>

3873
02:51:53.390 --> 02:51:58.390
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean they're going to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes a fighter was just </v>

3874
02:51:58.390 --> 02:51:58.390
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>

3875
02:51:58.390 --> 02:51:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Just club someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's fighters.</v>

3876
02:52:00.130 --> 02:52:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Fights have been lost where the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy was clearly the better fighter,</v>

3877
02:52:03.401 --> 02:52:06.160
<v Speaker 1>but he's still lost like right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A perfect is our nesto.</v>

3878
02:52:06.180 --> 02:52:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Hoost fought bob sapp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird example because it was in k</v>

3879
02:52:10.061 --> 02:52:12.330
<v Speaker 1>one have a huge guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

3880
02:52:12.580 --> 02:52:15.760
<v Speaker 1>And ernesto hoost is one of the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>kickboxers of all time,</v>

3881
02:52:15.970 --> 02:52:19.630
<v Speaker 1>but bob sapp is beat him twice and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make any sense.</v>

3882
02:52:19.631 --> 02:52:24.631
<v Speaker 1>it was only because bob sapp is 375 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds a fucking solid steroids and just</v>

3883
