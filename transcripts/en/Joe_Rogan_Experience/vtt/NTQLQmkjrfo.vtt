<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why I love going on</v>

10
00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:32.880
<v Speaker 1>these trips at Brian is because it</v>

13
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.010
<v Speaker 1>You're going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also your style of humor.</v>

14
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when there's a group of guys around</v>

15
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.010
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you would think that you would</v>

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:47.900
<v Speaker 1>get tired of gay jokes after five days.</v>

<v Speaker 1>do it an unnamed way.</v>

26
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.180

<v Speaker 1>audience and you're one of the best</v>

27
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:22.970
<v Speaker 1>laughers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>20 years.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's seductive to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm literally,</v>

34
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.700
<v Speaker 1>and then those guys or those guys are</v>
<v Speaker 1>such good audiences too.</v>

35
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Quintessential rock star with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different spectrum than,</v>

36
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:47.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>

37
00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Not too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

38
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:53.211
<v Speaker 1>You're being drug induced delirium and</v>
<v Speaker 1>going through the,</v>

39
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think those dudes at that time had,</v>

40
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>had probably been through enough to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen,</v>

41
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>I've been to the limit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

42
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I've seen the edge of the cliff debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the old adage like if you</v>

43
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:07.180
<v Speaker 1>suck enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:09.451 --> 00:02:12.750

<v Speaker 1>Like if a gay guy gets to some breaking</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well it doesn't happen,</v>

49
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.150

<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

67
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:16.350
<v Speaker 1>Joe Lou Reed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't that Lou Reed?</v>

68
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 1>David Bowie's God net worths Steve</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gutenberg.</v>

69
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 1>David Bowie's Goddamn free lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know there was some study recently</v>

70
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>about uh rehydrating and they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about like how much more people</v>

71
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 1>rehydrate if they're around things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>taste good.</v>

72
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Like if you have like sugary drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like gatorade type drink,</v>

73
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 1>like how much more you'll drink than if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just water,</v>

74
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

75
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.340
<v Speaker 1>we're just gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gross.</v>

76
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Slovenly and sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those simple sugars,</v>

77
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>like those are really not good for you</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean you didn't get away with eating</v>

78
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 1>them after you work out because your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body is sorta glucose craving,</v>

79
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>but the reality of those kinds of sports</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinks and stuff like that,</v>

80
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll fucking healthy for you at</v>

81
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:03.230
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This are corn syrup when liquid.</v>

82
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers.</v>

83
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Well I think most of the sports drinks</v>
<v Speaker 1>or are owned by companies that produce</v>

84
00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>soft drinks.</v>

85
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure a lot of them are for sure.</v>

86
00:04:13.421 --> 00:04:16.000
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them are for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they say the chocolate milk is the</v>

87
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>best thing to drink right after your</v>
<v Speaker 1>workout.</v>

88
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.200
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it depends who you talk to.</v>

89
00:04:21.201 --> 00:04:23.770
<v Speaker 1>You and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is based on some studies</v>

90
00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>that they've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you talk to anyone that's in the</v>

91
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Chinese medicine or like my wife's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really into Ayurvedic Medicine,</v>

92
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>milk is the demon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

93
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 1>what do they say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see it's drinking plus and then oak</v>

94
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 1>is drinking pus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's it drinking?</v>

95
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Pus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hate milk.</v>

96
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Who are these people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

97
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have they ever eaten cookies because</v>

98
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:48.280
<v Speaker 1>milk without cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just bullshit.</v>

99
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Cookies without milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crowded.</v>

100
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

101
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people into this method</v>
<v Speaker 1>of eating and you know,</v>

102
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 1>eating for your body type and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

103
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.270
<v Speaker 1>And anyone that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's three things in Chinese medicine</v>

104
00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:02.280
<v Speaker 1>that caused a lot of phlegm.</v>

105
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.460
<v Speaker 1>And in Chinese medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phlegm is not only what you hack up when</v>

106
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 1>you're exercising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They do all sorts of crazy stuff.</v>

119
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.790
<v Speaker 1>How about tiger bone make you strong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I take all this stuff with a grain of</v>

122
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think back at some of the</v>

123
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:49.720
<v Speaker 1>misconceptions you had in your youth</v>
<v Speaker 1>about sex,</v>

124
00:05:49.721 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 1>and it really is hilarious.</v>

125
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 1>I was under the impression that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed what was called at the time a</v>

126
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 1>scumbag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a condom.</v>

127
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 1>A rubber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are called that.</v>

128
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:01.000
<v Speaker 1>It was a condom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where a scumbag comes from.</v>

129
00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.970
<v Speaker 1>It was called a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

130
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 1>A condom was a scumbag back in the old</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

131
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was when I was a kid.</v>

132
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:10.880
<v Speaker 1>So I had never used that term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I heard my parents say that my dad's</v>

133
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

134
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have a scumbag last night,</v>

135
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>so shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

136
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 1>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought you needed one to get a</v>

137
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 1>girl pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought the shit that was on it got</v>

138
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 1>the girl pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

140
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>and I thought you had a fucker in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>

141
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't know that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vagina.</v>

142
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:32.870
<v Speaker 1>I just thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>is an ass you've so you fucker in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>

144
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Why with a condom and she has a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why</v>

145
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.610
<v Speaker 1>you off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the fucked up thing is now I fucked</v>

146
00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 1>girls don't want to have a kid so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't wear a condom and I fucked him on</v>

147
00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>the policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it did have some kind of an influence</v>

148
00:06:49.491 --> 00:06:54.491
<v Speaker 1>on my future when I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't remember where I learned</v>

149
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 1>this or if it was taught in class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I specifically remember something</v>

150
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.260
<v Speaker 1>where it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a real source where they</v>

151
00:07:01.261 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 1>were saying that in order for a woman to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get pregnant that she has to have an</v>

152
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.640
<v Speaker 1>orgasm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when a woman has an orgasm,</v>

153
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 1>it opens up the canal and the eggs get</v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

154
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 1>I remember like there's been some just</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously ignorant shit that I was</v>

155
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:15.170
<v Speaker 1>taught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

156
00:07:15.171 --> 00:07:15.861
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

157
00:07:15.861 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think may because of the</v>

158
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 1>moisture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:23.660
<v Speaker 1>it gives a little more fluid for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sperm cells to swim up,</v>

160
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:25.570
<v Speaker 1>but it was like a door was only good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

161
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.920
<v Speaker 1>like tall planing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a door was opening.</v>

162
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:32.380
<v Speaker 1>There's like 1980s healthcare shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno if they didn't know back then or</v>

163
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an older even textbook where they</v>

164
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:38.120
<v Speaker 1>were just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like something you'd tell a</v>

165
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:38.780
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

166
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.760
<v Speaker 1>so you could come in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

167
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:43.340
<v Speaker 1>I won't give you an Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll be fine.</v>

168
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.180
<v Speaker 1>As long as they don't make you calm when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm making any payments.</v>

169
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.710
<v Speaker 1>And then after I come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll make you come.</v>

170
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Nothing better than that.</v>
