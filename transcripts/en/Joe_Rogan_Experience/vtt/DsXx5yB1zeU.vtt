00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.280
<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're also paying for the sins of a lot</v>

2
00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:05.410
<v Speaker 1>of other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like for centuries let's,</v>

3
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white American men dominated everything</v>

4
00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:10.000
<v Speaker 1>in this country and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:14.590
<v Speaker 1>there's also a reality of a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were treated like garbage for a</v>

6
00:00:14.591 --> 00:00:18.400
<v Speaker 1>long time and a lot of promises were</v>
<v Speaker 1>broken and there's a reality to that.</v>

7
00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:20.080
<v Speaker 1>That's not excuse making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

8
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they say,</v>

9
00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:26.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know why people have benefited from</v>

10
00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:28.900
<v Speaker 1>that system leading to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's happening is in an effort to</v>

11
00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:33.370
<v Speaker 1>balance the playing field a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of us today are being treated</v>

12
00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:37.390
<v Speaker 1>unfairly because the balancing act is</v>
<v Speaker 1>making things go so far and like I do</v>

13
00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I had a conversation after a</v>

14
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.790
<v Speaker 1>tosh has a 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who did they get?</v>

15
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tracy's gay jokes.</v>

16
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.590
<v Speaker 1>And I had to get from folks who don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

17
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Tracy Morgan did a joke about if someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>was gay who had stabbed them.</v>

18
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody went crazy and I had a</v>

19
00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:55.300
<v Speaker 1>couple of gay comics on Rick Chrome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim David,</v>

20
00:00:55.301 --> 00:00:57.340
<v Speaker 1>and we talked about this on this comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>special I did.</v>

21
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.140
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the as Comedians,</v>

22
00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I asked them how do they feel about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>imbalance in the language,</v>

23
00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:04.640
<v Speaker 1>like the fact that you get in trouble</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that now and Jim Davidson,</v>

24
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

25
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.001
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

26
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:08.560
<v Speaker 1>how are you okay with it as a comic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

27
00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 1>because it's not a level playing field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning what he thought was like in</v>

28
00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:14.020
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay people had not treated as well,</v>

29
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.260
<v Speaker 1>so he didn't give a shit if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that guy got into a little bit more</v>

30
00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I kind of,</v>

31
00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I heard what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

32
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.580
<v Speaker 1>even though I don't want to get in</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble for it,</v>

33
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.530
<v Speaker 1>in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was right.</v>

34
00:01:23.531 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.780
<v Speaker 1>we still have a big segment of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>country that can't get married and</v>

36
00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:30.700
<v Speaker 1>they're treated like second class</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens.</v>

37
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.610
<v Speaker 1>But yet we go around and tell other</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries how to live their lives were</v>

38
00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Speaker 1>so full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me nuts.</v>

39
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a real legitimate</v>

40
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:42.851
<v Speaker 1>argument in the idea that until it</v>
<v Speaker 1>balances out,</v>

41
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.050
<v Speaker 1>until everyone completely relaxes on</v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination towards gays,</v>

42
00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's no discrimination on</v>

43
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:52.090
<v Speaker 1>bachelors anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.020
<v Speaker 1>like if a man has a 50 year old man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

45
00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not getting married again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no discrimination or social,</v>

46
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.650
<v Speaker 1>not a social pariah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if he decides to marry a man than it</v>

47
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:02.060
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what?</v>

48
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is that and why is that not</v>

49
00:02:03.921 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 1>eradicated from our culture that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:07.370
<v Speaker 1>once that is eradicated from our</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>

51
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.760
<v Speaker 1>then I think people are going to be much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely to accept gay jokes much</v>

52
00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:15.110
<v Speaker 1>more like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I keep hearing that gay jokes or</v>

53
00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:16.820
<v Speaker 1>homophobic and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

54
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

55
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not homophobic at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a gay joke.</v>

56
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Just like ha jokes about straight sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't header of Bobek.</v>

57
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are jokes about sex and there's,</v>

58
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.900
<v Speaker 1>there's jokes about everything and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really about context.</v>

59
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not about the subject matter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't eliminate certain subject</v>

60
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:35.990
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't because the human</v>

61
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:39.500
<v Speaker 1>language is very nuanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit going on and every</v>

62
00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:43.520
<v Speaker 1>single interaction that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're humor could potentially be crafted</v>

63
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:46.580
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be taken in a whole wide variety</v>

64
00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:49.490
<v Speaker 1>of different ways and I like all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ways.</v>

65
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I like people saying fucked up shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really mean.</v>

66
00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something funny and</v>

67
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Tracy Morgan saying if a photo most</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

68
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ludicrous,</v>

69
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not real.</v>

70
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Of course he wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it would be.</v>

71
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

72
00:03:06.571 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that it's like,</v>

73
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:09.930
<v Speaker 1>I do a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

74
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny cash didn't really shoot a man in</v>

75
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:14.120
<v Speaker 1>Reno just to watch him die either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

76
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might have more likely that he did</v>

77
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Tracy Morgan would establish son,</v>

78
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 1>stupid johnny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny.</v>

79
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Johnny cash probably should have said I</v>
<v Speaker 1>took some pills and fell asleep on the</v>

80
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>tour bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might be more accurate.</v>

81
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Longest boxing match ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out.</v>

82
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.090
<v Speaker 2>March ever typing</v>

83
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.050
<v Speaker 1>was the longest boxing match in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

84
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.550
<v Speaker 1>A boxing match landed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lasted seven hours already.</v>

85
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.560
<v Speaker 1>If I can do the man fuck is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>

86
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this.</v>

87
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.710
<v Speaker 1>The longest boxing match ever took place</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New Orleans on April sixth of 18,</v>

88
00:03:55.711 --> 00:03:58.770
<v Speaker 1>93.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The matches between Andy Bowen and Jack</v>

89
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Burke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both of whom claimed the lightweight</v>

90
00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 1>title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the reigning champ,</v>

91
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Jack Mccall full all of fee all fluffy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Mccall.</v>

92
00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:08.730
<v Speaker 1>If he retired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the winner of this take all purse was</v>

93
00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:13.650
<v Speaker 1>set at $2,500 and in order to decide who</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really the new champion,</v>

94
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.050
<v Speaker 1>that match was set to fought to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>finish.</v>

95
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.890
<v Speaker 1>They fought to a finish like that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the contest.</v>

96
00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Fighters went at each other aggressively</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounding each other with their gloves,</v>

97
00:04:23.071 --> 00:04:27.630
<v Speaker 1>inflicting and sustaining tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment that read like someone wrote</v>

98
00:04:27.631 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 1>it with their pants off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That Red Light is vigorously oiled,</v>

99
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.270
<v Speaker 1>up and shaved and are yet three minute</v>
<v Speaker 1>rounds wore off.</v>

100
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went to a hundred and 11 rounds.</v>

101
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Both fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dazed and weary gave up and did not come</v>

102
00:04:46.171 --> 00:04:47.010
<v Speaker 1>out of their corner.</v>

103
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.570
<v Speaker 1>Pull zoos or you can't fight one hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>and twelfth round.</v>

104
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.880
<v Speaker 1>We'll move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be one guy telling them,</v>

105
00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:58.140
<v Speaker 1>just get up rocky here and you'll win</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guinness.</v>

106
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Guinness says it's 276 rounds in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 English people might.</v>

107
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.240
<v Speaker 1>We heard it much longer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are.</v>

108
00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Endurance is superior with proper boxing</v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

109
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.960
<v Speaker 1>That sounded more South African,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe they're right man.</v>

110
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever fought over 100 rounds is the</v>

111
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:20.100
<v Speaker 1>craziest fucking human being that's ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived.</v>

112
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.720
<v Speaker 1>That fight was only four and a half</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

113
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.823
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>

114
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.560
<v Speaker 1>One of the 32nd rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even make sense.</v>

115
00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:29.400
<v Speaker 1>I can't even do the math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to try 2,500 bucks.</v>

116
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:30.743
