1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.280
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're also paying for the sins of a lot</v>

2
00:00:03.281 --> 00:00:05.260
<v Speaker 1>of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for centuries,</v>

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.040
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.220
<v Speaker 1>white American men dominated everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country.</v>

5
00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:09.760
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

6
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also a reality of a lot of</v>

7
00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:16.420
<v Speaker 1>people were treated like garbage for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time and a lot of promises were</v>

8
00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:18.400
<v Speaker 1>broken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a reality to that.</v>

9
00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:20.240
<v Speaker 1>That's not excuse making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not right.</v>

10
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

11
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.040
<v Speaker 1>and then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

12
00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:27.250
<v Speaker 1>you know why people have benefited from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that system even to,</v>

13
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.670
<v Speaker 1>so what's happening is in an effort to</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance the fucking playing field a</v>

14
00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:33.370
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of us today are being treated</v>

15
00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>unfairly because the balancing act is</v>
<v Speaker 1>making things go so far.</v>

16
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Like I do understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

17
00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>that's why I had a conversation after a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tashas.</v>

18
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 1>and who did they get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

20
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Tracy's gay jokes.</v>

21
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.590
<v Speaker 1>And I had a couple of days from folks</v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't know,</v>

22
00:00:47.591 --> 00:00:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Tracy Morgan did a joke about if his son</v>
<v Speaker 1>was gay,</v>

23
00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:51.650
<v Speaker 1>he would stab them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 1>And everybody went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had a couple of gay comics on Rick</v>

25
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.340
<v Speaker 1>Chrome and Jim David and we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this on this comedy special I did.</v>

26
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.140
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the as Comedians,</v>

27
00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:01.690
<v Speaker 1>I asked them how do they feel about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>imbalance in the language?</v>

28
00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Like the fact that you get in trouble</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that now.</v>

29
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.380
<v Speaker 1>And Jim David said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay with it.</v>

30
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.880
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

31
00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:08.260
<v Speaker 1>well how are you okay with there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic?</v>

32
00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:09.940
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's not a level playing field.</v>

33
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Meaning what he thought was like in</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

34
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:15.400
<v Speaker 1>gay people had not treated as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he didn't give a shit if,</v>

35
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>if that guy got in a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble and I kind of,</v>

36
00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I heard what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

37
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.580
<v Speaker 1>even though I don't want to get in</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble for it,</v>

38
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.530
<v Speaker 1>in that sense he was right.</v>

39
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.780
<v Speaker 1>we still have a big segment of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>country that can't get married and</v>

41
00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:30.700
<v Speaker 1>they're treated like second class</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens,</v>

42
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.580
<v Speaker 1>but yet we go around and tell other</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries had to live their lives were</v>

43
00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Speaker 1>so fully shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes me nuts.</v>

44
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a real legitimate</v>

45
00:01:37.871 --> 00:01:39.910
<v Speaker 1>argument in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:01:39.911 --> 00:01:44.911
<v Speaker 1>idea that until it balances out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until everyone completely relaxes on</v>

47
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:48.310
<v Speaker 1>discrimination towards gays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

48
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.160
<v Speaker 1>like there's no discrimination on</v>
<v Speaker 1>bachelors anymore.</v>

49
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if a man is a 50 year old man,</v>

50
00:01:53.741 --> 00:01:55.150
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not getting married again.</v>

51
00:01:55.151 --> 00:01:58.120
<v Speaker 1>There's no discrimination or social pro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not a social pariah.</v>

52
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.630
<v Speaker 1>But if he decides to marry a man than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>

53
00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:02.201
<v Speaker 1>well what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 1>what is that and why is that not</v>
<v Speaker 1>eradicated from our culture yet?</v>

55
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once that is eradicated from our</v>

56
00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:10.360
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I shank people are going to be much</v>

57
00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:13.210
<v Speaker 1>more likely to accept gay jokes much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more like,</v>

58
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.360
<v Speaker 1>because I keep hearing that gay jokes or</v>
<v Speaker 1>homophobic and I'm like,</v>

59
00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:16.810
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>

60
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

61
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not homophobic at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a gay joke.</v>

62
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Just like jokes about straight sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't Hetero volvic alright,</v>

63
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.050
<v Speaker 1>they're jokes about sex and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

64
00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:29.890
<v Speaker 1>there's jokes about everything and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really about context.</v>

65
00:02:29.891 --> 00:02:33.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not about the subject matter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't eliminate certain subject</v>

66
00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:35.980
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just can't because the human</v>

67
00:02:35.981 --> 00:02:39.490
<v Speaker 1>language is very nuance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of shit going on in every</v>

68
00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:43.510
<v Speaker 1>single interaction that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're humor could potentially be crafted</v>

69
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:45.880
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be taken into a whole wide</v>

70
00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:49.510
<v Speaker 1>variety of different ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I like all of those ways.</v>

71
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.180
<v Speaker 1>I like people saying fucked up shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't really mean.</v>

72
00:02:52.181 --> 00:02:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this something funny and Tracy</v>

73
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.870
<v Speaker 1>Morgan saying if a photo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them was good,</v>

74
00:02:56.871 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>I still be a little new glue and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

75
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.660
<v Speaker 1>It's ludicrous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

76
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course he wouldn't do that.</v>

77
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Of course it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous.</v>

79
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>The idea that it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a joke in my act like guess what,</v>

80
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Cash didn't really shoot a man in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reno just to watch him die either.</v>

81
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he did.</v>

82
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>He might more likely that he did it then</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tracy Morgan would stab his son.</v>

83
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bid johnny,</v>

84
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Cash probably should have said I</v>

85
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>took some pills and fell asleep on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tour bus.</v>

86
00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I'd be more accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Longest boxing match ever.</v>

87
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:28.984
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out.</v>

<v Speaker 1>if I can do the math man,</v>

92

<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that real?</v>

93
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this.</v>

95
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.460
<v Speaker 1>The longest boxing match ever took place</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New Orleans on April six of 1893 the</v>

96
00:03:56.461 --> 00:03:58.770
<v Speaker 1>matches between Andy Bowen and Jack</v>
<v Speaker 1>Burke,</v>

97
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 1>both of whom claimed the lightweight</v>
<v Speaker 1>title after the reigning Champ,</v>

98
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Jack McCall,</v>

100
00:04:08.701 --> 00:04:13.680
<v Speaker 1>set at $2,500 and in order to decide who</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really the new champion,</v>

101
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.970
<v Speaker 1>the match was set to fought to a finish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fought to a finish.</v>

102
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.890
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All through the contest,</v>

103
00:04:19.891 --> 00:04:23.070
<v Speaker 1>fighters went at each other aggressively</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounding each other with their gloves,</v>

104
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.500
<v Speaker 1>inflicting and sustaining tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>

105
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.170
<v Speaker 1>That red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone wrote it with their pants</v>

106
00:04:28.171 --> 00:04:30.260
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That red light is a vigorous.</v>

107
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.810
<v Speaker 1>They masturbating oiled up and shaved</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ah,</v>

108
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.080
<v Speaker 1>yet three minute rounds wore off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

109
00:04:37.081 --> 00:04:42.081
<v Speaker 1>They went to 111 rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both fighters,</v>

110
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.000
<v Speaker 1>dazed and weary gave up.</v>

111
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.180
<v Speaker 1>And did not come out of their corner</v>
<v Speaker 1>pools.</v>

112
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't fight on hundred and 12th</v>

113
00:04:51.091 --> 00:04:56.091
<v Speaker 1>around how to be one guy telling him</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get up rocky and your win.</v>

114
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Guinness Guinness says it's 276 rounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1825 that's the English people.</v>

115
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Why might we heard it much longer than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

116
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Our endurance is superior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've proper boxing training.</v>

117
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.630
<v Speaker 1>That sounded more South African,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe they're right,</v>
