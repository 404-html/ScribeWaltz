150
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:12.480
<v Speaker 5>very talented Brazilian Jujitsu fighter.</v>

151
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 5>But his real last name I don't believe was initially Gracie.</v>

152
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.860
<v Speaker 5>I think he sort of,</v>

153
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.860
<v Speaker 4>and those cousins,</v>

154
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.460
<v Speaker 5>his hands,</v>

155
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.200
<v Speaker 5>his cousin.</v>

156
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.770
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

157
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:22.521
<v Speaker 5>And I think his,</v>

158
00:04:22.521 --> 00:04:22.751
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>

159
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:24.290
<v Speaker 5>his mom's name is Gracie,</v>

160
00:04:24.291 --> 00:04:27.020
<v Speaker 5>but his dad's name and his birth name was not Gracie.</v>

161
00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:27.854
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

162
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.083
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

163
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.230
<v Speaker 5>I believe this is what I believe.</v>

164
00:04:36.231 --> 00:04:38.840
<v Speaker 5>I believe he's a very talented fighter,</v>

165
00:04:38.841 --> 00:04:43.841
<v Speaker 5>but I believe this whole idea of connecting yourself to the word Gracie is it is</v>

166
00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:48.530
<v Speaker 5>ultimately very self defeating and when a guy does that,</v>

167
00:04:48.531 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 5>I almost want to pull them aside.</v>

168
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:50.991
<v Speaker 5>If the look Daniel,</v>

169
00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:53.690
<v Speaker 5>you're a bad motherfucker or whatever the fuck your last name is,</v>

170
00:04:53.691 --> 00:04:54.620
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't matter.</v>

171
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.820
<v Speaker 5>You know you need to get your head wrapped around the fact that that's all</v>

172
00:04:58.821 --> 00:04:59.480
<v Speaker 5>bullshit.</v>

173
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 5>Gracie is a great name but it's 2013 and when he was competing eight,</v>

174
00:05:05.841 --> 00:05:06.440
<v Speaker 5>nine,</v>

175
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.670
<v Speaker 5>10 whatever the fuck it was,</v>

176
00:05:07.671 --> 00:05:12.671
<v Speaker 5>2000 it doesn't matter what matters is how good you are and adopting the name.</v>

177
00:05:14.421 --> 00:05:17.300
<v Speaker 5>Gracie almost makes people think like,</v>

178
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.670
<v Speaker 5>oh well this guy is trying to get a little extra attention for for no reason.</v>

179
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.310
<v Speaker 5>The the,</v>

180
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.491
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

181
00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:26.390
<v Speaker 5>the world championships or the world championships and you either mounted guy</v>

182
00:05:26.391 --> 00:05:27.290
<v Speaker 5>who take us back,</v>

183
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.133
<v Speaker 5>you tap him,</v>

184
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.090
<v Speaker 5>whatever you do,</v>

185
00:05:29.091 --> 00:05:33.170
<v Speaker 5>you either do or you don't do and it doesn't matter if your name is Marcello</v>

186
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.570
<v Speaker 5>Garcia who's unbelievably respected.</v>

187
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.780
<v Speaker 5>I mean Marcel Garcia is the top of the pyramid when it comes to Brazilian</v>

188
00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:41.421
<v Speaker 5>Jujitsu.</v>

189
00:05:41.421 --> 00:05:44.300
<v Speaker 5>In the world today in 2013 or Gracie,</v>

190
00:05:44.301 --> 00:05:45.200
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't matter.</v>

191
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.820
<v Speaker 5>So whatever his name was,</v>

192
00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:47.840
<v Speaker 5>what was his real name?</v>

193
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.951
<v Speaker 5>Matt.</v>

194
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:55.180
<v Speaker 5>How many times you've been hiding in your life?</v>

195
00:05:55.181 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 5>Don't lie to me many times.</v>

196
00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 5>What have you been hiding your life?</v>

197
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

198
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 5>more than 10 is it more than 10</v>

199
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.900
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

200
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:05.620
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

201
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.453
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

202
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.710
<v Speaker 5>so we could probably go camping together.</v>

203
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.980
<v Speaker 5>How many times do you eat and pot brownies and thought about chicks you fingered</v>

204
00:06:11.981 --> 00:06:12.850
<v Speaker 5>when you were 14?</v>

205
00:06:12.851 --> 00:06:14.450
<v Speaker 5>You were really upset like Kyra.</v>

206
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.320
<v Speaker 5>Gracie more than 10.</v>

207
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.090
<v Speaker 5>That's why I love talking to you,</v>

208
00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:19.924
<v Speaker 5>Matt.</v>

209
00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.150
<v Speaker 5>Let's keep it together,</v>

210
00:06:22.151 --> 00:06:22.984
<v Speaker 5>Matt.</v>

211
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.180
<v Speaker 5>But there was a few guys that did that.</v>

212
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.420
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

213
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.160
<v Speaker 5>the Gracie thing where they use,</v>

214
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.480
<v Speaker 1>what I'm going to say is Daniel Gracie's,</v>

215
00:06:30.481 --> 00:06:31.470
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to go,</v>

216
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:32.191
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to say?</v>

217
00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:33.240
<v Speaker 1>He's a bad motherfucker,</v>

218
00:06:33.241 --> 00:06:33.501
<v Speaker 1>but oh,</v>

219
00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:34.110
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

220
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.640
<v Speaker 1>he took us around Brazil.</v>

221
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:36.750
<v Speaker 1>He took us to the valley.</v>

222
00:06:36.751 --> 00:06:37.351
<v Speaker 1>Tudo Jim's.</v>

223
00:06:37.351 --> 00:06:38.400
<v Speaker 1>He took us to the gyms.</v>

224
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.240
<v Speaker 1>He took us with Matt and I got to say it was fucking,</v>

225
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.901
<v Speaker 1>I got to say,</v>

226
00:06:42.901 --> 00:06:45.780
<v Speaker 1>you see a different level of shit down there.</v>

227
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll see anywhere else they did.</v>

228
00:06:47.431 --> 00:06:49.050
<v Speaker 1>These guys trained like motherfuckers</v>

229
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.330
<v Speaker 5>to hear this mat and do you agree with this?</v>

230
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:06.700
<v Speaker 4>At the time was like the worst of the worst and we had to go ask the boss if we</v>

231
00:07:07.591 --> 00:07:10.850
<v Speaker 4>could come in here and tell the boss you're here,</v>

232
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.521
<v Speaker 4>no problem.</v>
