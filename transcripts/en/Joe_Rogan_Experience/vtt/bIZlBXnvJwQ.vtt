15
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of bands,</v>

16
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.201
<v Speaker 1>oh by the way,</v>

17
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:20.450
<v Speaker 1>we are sponsored by the fleshlight.</v>

18
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.411
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>

20
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:23.244
<v Speaker 1>we're sponsored by them.</v>

21
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>And what we were talking about before we got into that was this thing on the</v>

22
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>highway today in Los Angeles there was a band and was the band called perial</v>

23
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.030
<v Speaker 1>stars imperial stars.</v>

24
00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>Now I didn't know about this.</v>

25
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I lucky I missed this.</v>

26
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>I didn't leave the house today,</v>

27
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.370
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

28
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.370
<v Speaker 1>when it happened apparently was these guys got on the highway and they turned</v>

29
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:43.831
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

30
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>their stopped their truck and turned it sideways so that the create a traffic</v>

31
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>jam.</v>

32
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.540
<v Speaker 1>And then they started saying,</v>

33
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.413
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

34
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.460
<v Speaker 1>the biggest piece of attention whoring may be anyone's ever done stood on the</v>

35
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>truck playing music by the way.</v>

36
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>Like they had like full now these dumb motherfuckers probably thought that this</v>

37
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:02.221
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

38
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>this is like the opening scene in our movie,</v>

39
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

40
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.071
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

41
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like they were so wild.</v>

42
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Like this is how they got discovered.</v>

43
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:11.490
<v Speaker 1>They got on top of the truck and they stopped traffic and the fucking music was</v>

44
00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:12.210
<v Speaker 1>so good.</v>

45
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>People who didn't care man get it.</v>

46
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:16.150
<v Speaker 1>And the crazy thing is,</v>

48
00:01:16.151 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>is they actually,</v>

49
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I listened to the song,</v>

50
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've heard it.</v>

51
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:20.094
<v Speaker 1>I have not heard it.</v>

52
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>If I want to hate them,</v>

53
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.231
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

54
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>If it was really good I would have been like,</v>

55
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:24.691
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

56
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:27.570
<v Speaker 1>there's no way it could be really good cause it's w it was really good.</v>

57
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.620
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't be willing to do this.</v>

58
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>It just makes you have to be a Douche bag.</v>

59
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a Douche bag to want to stop traffic and get on the news and do</v>

60
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>all this at other people's expense.</v>

61
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.041
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

62
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Because you want to be known for your fucking music.</v>

63
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

64
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Especially in this city where that fucking row.</v>

65
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>What about people who are on the way to the hospital?</v>

66
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 1>What about people were on the way to serious emergencies?</v>

67
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>What about people that lost their job because of you?</v>

68
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:54.620
<v Speaker 1>That was the one day that were late again over the mark are,</v>

69
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>maybe if it had a fucking thing,</v>

71
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.200
<v Speaker 1>if you're late again this month you're fired and they were fired because you</v>

72
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>fuck you dude.</v>

73
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Even if the song is all about traffic on the one on one,</v>

74
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:05.761
<v Speaker 1>that's the bad thing.</v>

75
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the song is all about and what sucks is that every news place it's going</v>

76
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>to talk about this and you know,</v>

77
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:13.740
<v Speaker 1>there's so many dumb asses out there that's going to like fall for this whole</v>

78
00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:15.230
<v Speaker 1>trick and they're going to become their,</v>

79
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>their Twitter account went up today.</v>

80
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming a bit that I maybe,</v>

81
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they did.</v>

82
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably fall.</v>

83
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.441
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

84
00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:23.450
<v Speaker 1>I would have hope for the,</v>

85
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>they'll say something really stupid,</v>

86
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>but I mean that we just have to discourage that kind of shit.</v>

87
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that,</v>

88
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

89
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.121
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

90
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:30.331
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

91
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing if you want to do something for publicity and it doesn't fuck</v>

92
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 1>with everybody else's life,</v>

93
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>but when you want to do something like that in La and you want to stop traffic,</v>

94
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:41.280
<v Speaker 1>just so that you get a tension essentially,</v>

95
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>like this is how we're going to make it,</v>

96
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

97
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 1>this is brilliant publicity style.</v>

98
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Like you guys are idiots.</v>

99
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>That's an idiot move,</v>

100
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:48.210
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

101
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.043
<v Speaker 1>It sucks.</v>

102
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.831
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

103
00:02:49.831 --> 00:02:50.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>maybe a bounce back from it and you maybe you fucked up and maybe you guys were</v>

105
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>all high on coke and it seems like an awesome idea.</v>

106
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you shitty human beings.</v>

107
00:02:58.711 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>You fucked though.</v>

108
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.453
<v Speaker 1>You want to hear this song</v>

109
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>is fucking song.</v>

110
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.053
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

111
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

112
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.923
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

113
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

114
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Now actually I,</v>

115
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.053
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>

116
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.001
<v Speaker 1>I forgot.</v>

117
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that on this computer.</v>

118
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Remember it gets right.</v>

119
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>I can't get him to do it on the IPAD.</v>

120
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

121
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.253
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>

122
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

123
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

124
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 1>talk about some joy.</v>

125
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.083
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>

126
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand the appeal for all of these reality shows where all these</v>

127
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>people become famous for no reason.</v>

128
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.841
<v Speaker 1>And then people go,</v>

129
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:35.531
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

130
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>it's all just about getting eyes on you and then once you get eyes on you,</v>

131
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>you can be a business and you can even use that for good.</v>

132
00:03:40.571 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 1>You can go on Oprah Style and fucking save the world with all the money.</v>

133
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:44.081
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

134
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Kim Kardashians is going to do that,</v>

135
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>so maybe all this will become a good thing.</v>

136
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:48.260
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

137
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>

138
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 1>people are trying to find ways to get attention outside of the normal shit</v>

139
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 1>outside of being recognized for something recognized for what you do.</v>

140
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>You know this fucking Dee aunt word is perfect.</v>

141
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 1>However you say it.</v>

142
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Diane would die at Word Diet Ward.</v>

143
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>That rap band.</v>

144
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>We were playing it.</v>

145
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

146
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>we haven't,</v>

147
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>there's no publicity stunts.</v>

148
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing.</v>

149
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>They didn't fucking start a fire in a mall.</v>

150
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.250
<v Speaker 1>All they did was make bad ass music and it got on youtube and everybody's like,</v>

151
00:04:15.251 --> 00:04:15.461
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

152
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>this is the shit.</v>

153
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:16.991
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>

154
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>This is fucking cool.</v>

155
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>It's real smart.</v>

156
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>They did it to the whole clip is like two minutes long.</v>

157
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Is this the song dude in?</v>

158
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>It's really poor green screen effects.</v>

159
00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.841
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

160
00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:29.674
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

161
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.640
<v Speaker 1>this is really low.</v>

162
00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:51.474
<v Speaker 1>Can we turn it off?</v>

163
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.040
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

164
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.413
<v Speaker 2>stuck in</v>

165
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.553
<v Speaker 2>traffic.</v>

166
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.880
<v Speaker 1>So it sounds,</v>

167
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.960
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like to me it's like a fake video used inside a movie.</v>

168
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

169
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.280
<v Speaker 1>like tropic thunder,</v>

170
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.790
<v Speaker 1>look at this new video that's on.</v>

171
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.610
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

172
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.600
<v Speaker 1>That's what it sounds like to me.</v>

173
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Perfect way of describing it,</v>

174
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.991
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

175
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>That is the perfect way to describe fake videos.</v>

176
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.760
<v Speaker 1>They're playing musicians,</v>

177
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:45.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

178
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

179
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:46.211
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

180
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:47.610
<v Speaker 1>They do look like you even had a wig on.</v>

181
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Two got fabulous hair.</v>

182
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.603
<v Speaker 1>Don't hate,</v>

183
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

184
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

185
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.981
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

186
00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:53.311
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

187
00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.110
<v Speaker 1>they sounded like they're playing musicians.</v>

188
00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 1>I just hope there's no trying to get famous it bad.</v>

189
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was,</v>

190
00:05:58.271 --> 00:05:59.390
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't say it was terrible.</v>

191
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 1>I just hope there's another like copy catters you know,</v>

192
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

193
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 1>oh Mike Acoustic people,</v>

194
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

195
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 1>putting their bikes in the middle of a highway.</v>

196
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.790
<v Speaker 1>You got to talk people,</v>

197
00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:11.760
<v Speaker 1>we hit that guy might have started something and you know,</v>

198
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 1>the economy is bad,</v>

199
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>but what the fuck people,</v>

200
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

201
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.253
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

202
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

203
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.150
<v Speaker 1>what if that does happen?</v>

204
00:06:17.151 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 1>What do people started doing that all the time now?</v>

205
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.440
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to make a,</v>

206
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.160
<v Speaker 1>make an example out of these guys,</v>

207
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 1>they're probably going to charge them a lot of money.</v>

208
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

209
00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 1>What if it's nothing?</v>

210
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 1>What if it's like,</v>

211
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.831
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

212
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:27.670
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be something that's got to be something big because they blocked</v>

213
00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 1>traffic.</v>

214
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 1>That's like a felony.</v>

215
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.470
<v Speaker 1>I think what they did for publicity's,</v>

216
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:32.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fairly serious,</v>

217
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

218
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.791
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

219
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

220
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 1>I think they could go to jail.</v>

221
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.110
<v Speaker 1>It's actually possible they go to jail for something like that.</v>

222
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Like unlawful restraint.</v>

223
00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:40.401
<v Speaker 1>You're an offer restraint.</v>

224
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

225
00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.850
<v Speaker 1>You can put like a kidnapping charge on danger to you put human beings danger to</v>

226
00:06:44.851 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 1>your clothes off the highways and make,</v>

227
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.160
<v Speaker 1>make it tough for people to get around ambulances.</v>

228
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

229
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.450
<v Speaker 1>someone's dad could have died because you know,</v>

230
00:06:51.451 --> 00:06:54.050
<v Speaker 1>there's a heart attack and they rushed him to the hospital and they can't get</v>

231
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 1>there in time because you fucking decided to sing in the road.</v>

232
00:06:56.781 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 1>You can't fuck you.</v>

233
00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

234
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 1>that's just dumb.</v>

235
00:07:00.621 --> 00:07:01.371
<v Speaker 1>And everybody,</v>

236
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 1>everybody should react the same way to them.</v>

238
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Even if you like him.</v>

239
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.811
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

240
00:07:04.811 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

241
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 1>that was a dumb move,</v>

242
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

243
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 1>There's just something so not cool.</v>

244
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 1>Something should start from this like it's a new tradition.</v>

245
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Every time you see these guys in public,</v>

246
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 1>you have to throw a tomato at them.</v>

247
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.110
<v Speaker 1>They should charge them for everybody that was late.</v>

248
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Think about all the people that were late,</v>

249
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of people that were late there.</v>

250
00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Their employers have to pay the person for the time that they weren't even at</v>

251
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:23.710
<v Speaker 1>work because they were stuck in a traffic jam because these assholes,</v>

252
00:07:23.711 --> 00:07:24.544
<v Speaker 1>they should all like,</v>

253
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>they should like,</v>

254
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.330
<v Speaker 1>they could stack all that up.</v>

255
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.111
<v Speaker 1>They should like find out,</v>

256
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:27.291
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

257
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:27.771
<v Speaker 1>what do you get?</v>

258
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:28.880
<v Speaker 1>You get $50 an hour.</v>

259
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:29.530
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

260
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.390
<v Speaker 1>this guy gets 20 bucks an hour and this guy,</v>

261
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.320
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

262
00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.130
<v Speaker 1>45 minutes and we'll calculate it up and you know,</v>

263
00:07:35.131 --> 00:07:35.481
<v Speaker 1>and Oh,</v>

264
00:07:35.481 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 1>you owe $1 million.</v>

265
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 1>You Fuck?</v>

266
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.031
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

267
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:40.910
<v Speaker 1>This guy was auditioning for iron man for he could've made this much money.</v>

268
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

269
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:42.891
<v Speaker 1>you crazy.</v>

270
00:07:42.891 --> 00:07:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

271
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:43.963
<v Speaker 1>You could get crazy.</v>

272
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Like I had a fishing in a dream.</v>

273
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I knew it was going to happen for me.</v>

274
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Everything in my vision was absolutely perfect and true,</v>

275
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 1>except you decided to sing on the fucking freeway.</v>

276
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.020
<v Speaker 1>What would have been smarter if they hired these guys at these guys were</v>

277
00:07:57.021 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 1>homeless guys and they were,</v>

278
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 1>they made like this fake video up just to make it look like they were the ones</v>

279
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:01.491
<v Speaker 1>singing.</v>

280
00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:03.950
<v Speaker 1>But the real band hired these people to get in trouble,</v>

281
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:05.920
<v Speaker 1>to go to jail so they wouldn't get in trouble I think.</v>

282
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.880
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with a band like that,</v>

283
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:10.250
<v Speaker 1>is it anybody that would come up with a stunt like that,</v>

284
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:11.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be good.</v>

285
00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

286
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.101
<v Speaker 1>You're just not going to be good.</v>

287
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

288
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Because obviously aren't famous yet.</v>

289
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:15.381
<v Speaker 1>What's not?</v>

290
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:16.021
<v Speaker 1>And even not the,</v>

291
00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:16.870
<v Speaker 1>you're not famous yet.</v>

292
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's a lot of good bands that aren't famous.</v>

293
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:22.460
<v Speaker 1>It's about being famous in the music business is a fucking weird thing.</v>

294
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:23.930
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really make sense.</v>

295
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy.</v>

296
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.113
<v Speaker 1>It's tricky,</v>

297
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

298
00:08:26.571 --> 00:08:26.931
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

299
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:28.100
<v Speaker 1>but with the Internet,</v>

300
00:08:28.101 --> 00:08:29.890
<v Speaker 1>like look at this word thing,</v>

301
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.370
<v Speaker 1>you can get famous.</v>

302
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:32.660
<v Speaker 1>You just have to put something together.</v>

303
00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:34.130
<v Speaker 1>And their shit was cheap.</v>

304
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:34.701
<v Speaker 1>I mean it wasn't,</v>

305
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:35.241
<v Speaker 1>there was nothing.</v>

306
00:08:35.241 --> 00:08:35.460
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

307
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.201
<v Speaker 1>For the high tech,</v>

308
00:08:36.201 --> 00:08:37.940
<v Speaker 1>nothing to it from South Africa.</v>

309
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:38.774
<v Speaker 1>We know about him.</v>

310
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.873
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

311
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean he did.</v>

312
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.690
<v Speaker 1>They did it right.</v>

313
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:42.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

314
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:43.131
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

315
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:43.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

316
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:48.470
<v Speaker 1>it's tricky like to try to like get record sales and shit and get in the door</v>

317
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:50.180
<v Speaker 1>and get played on the radio and everything.</v>

318
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like man,</v>

319
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.540
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking funky business.</v>

320
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 1>And it got gutted because of the MP3S online.</v>

321
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Like the music business is a state of shambles.</v>

322
00:08:59.011 --> 00:08:59.844
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

323
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.470
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting with something like this,</v>

324
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Dee aunt word comes in and shakes things up,</v>

325
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's annoying when you see the other manifestations of it,</v>

326
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 1>like these assholes with their fucking bus on the highway.</v>

327
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.793
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

328
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 1>it's just sad that someone would decide to do that.</v>

329
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 1>That you would be so fucking selfish and stupid.</v>

330
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 1>You would want to block off a main route just so that you could,</v>

331
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

332
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.520
<v Speaker 1>make it man,</v>

333

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:26.701

00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:28.800
<v Speaker 1>what are the odds those guys aren't annoying as fuck.</v>

337
00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:29.091

338
00:09:29.091 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 1>here's a quote.</v>

339
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.760
<v Speaker 1>The band describes themselves as rock stars living on the edge.</v>

340
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 1>They're known for getting crazy and hanging out with their friends.</v>

341
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a real quote.</v>

342
00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Shut the fuck up.</v>

343
00:09:40.801 --> 00:09:41.910
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God.</v>

344
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.680
<v Speaker 1>Fucking La times.com.</v>

345
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:44.401
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading it right now.</v>

00:09:44.401 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck up the band?</v>

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.251
<v Speaker 1>The band.</v>

348
00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 1>This is a subtle colony.</v>

349
00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:48.781
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>

351
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm starting to become a thing.</v>

352
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.500
<v Speaker 1>I think I just became a thing.</v>

353
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:55.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

356
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.800
<v Speaker 1>This is a subtle comedy.</v>

357
00:09:58.830 --> 00:09:59.820
<v Speaker 1>My bad internet.</v>

358

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

380
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.650
<v Speaker 1>The band describes itself,</v>

381
00:10:31.651 --> 00:10:33.470
<v Speaker 1>says rock stars.</v>

382
00:10:33.471 --> 00:10:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

383

<v Speaker 1>This is an all caps with an exclamation point.</v>

384
00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:38.343
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

385
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.660
<v Speaker 1>living on the edge.</v>

386
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:43.080
<v Speaker 1>They're known for getting crazy and hanging out with their friends.</v>

387
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.331
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

388
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:50.331
<v Speaker 1>It says they debuted in 2010 with a hardcore hip hop album,</v>

389
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:52.111
<v Speaker 1>but wait a minute.</v>

390
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Are they rock stars or are they hardcore hip hop artists?</v>

391
00:10:55.621 --> 00:10:56.760
<v Speaker 1>They can do anything.</v>

392
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.600
<v Speaker 1>That is crazy.</v>

393
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Is that a new thing that's going on now?</v>

394
00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Like hip hop and rock?</v>

395
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.500
<v Speaker 1>It's just this all together.</v>

396
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just a setting and garage band nowadays so they can do anything they</v>

397
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:05.490
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>

398
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.140
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

399
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:06.973
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

400
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.940
<v Speaker 1>The band describes itself.</v>

401
00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:09.571
<v Speaker 1>I'll say this again.</v>

402
00:11:09.571 --> 00:11:14.571
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who haven't crashed your fucking cars in furious white knuckled</v>

403
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:16.320
<v Speaker 1>anger at these cunts.</v>

404
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.480
<v Speaker 1>The Ben described itself as rock stars live in the on the edge.</v>

405
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.680
<v Speaker 1>They're known for getting crazy and hanging out with their friends.</v>

406
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:26.990
<v Speaker 1>That's a real quality.</v>

407
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.210
<v Speaker 1>He's seen the truck to that that was pulled over that was like,</v>

408
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:30.630
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

409
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:31.800
<v Speaker 1>it looks like Wayne's world</v>

410
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.340
<v Speaker 1>fucking picture of them.</v>

411
00:11:35.341 --> 00:11:36.900
<v Speaker 1>It looks like something from Wayne's world.</v>

412
00:11:36.901 --> 00:11:37.591
<v Speaker 1>It looks vague.</v>

413
00:11:37.591 --> 00:11:38.640
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even look real.</v>

414
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.110
<v Speaker 1>I hope this is not a movie.</v>

415
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:41.970
<v Speaker 1>It might be.</v>

416
00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.050
<v Speaker 1>They might be brilliant.</v>

417
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:44.340
<v Speaker 1>It seems like it is.</v>

418
00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:45.601
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>

419
00:11:45.601 --> 00:11:45.961
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

420
00:11:45.961 --> 00:11:47.970
<v Speaker 1>it seemed like a fake band inside of a movie.</v>

421
00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.290
<v Speaker 1>What full thing is a fake hand?</v>

422
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:50.603
<v Speaker 1>I bet it is.</v>

423
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.683
<v Speaker 1>I bet it is.</v>

424
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:52.410
<v Speaker 1>There just is.</v>

425
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:52.680
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

426
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

427
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:53.730
<v Speaker 1>if they are,</v>

428
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>

429
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.420
<v Speaker 1>then they're really fucked because if they make a movie and they closed the</v>

430
00:11:58.421 --> 00:12:00.490
<v Speaker 1>highway down for a movie like that.</v>

431
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

432
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:01.983
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

433
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that because first of all,</v>

434
00:12:04.421 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 1>you would have cameras everywhere.</v>

435
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:06.970
<v Speaker 1>You'd have real cameras.</v>

436
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.330
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't have a fucking little youtube cameras or they're going to do a stunt</v>

437
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:11.110
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

438
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:12.590
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have to have like real permits.</v>

439
00:12:12.591 --> 00:12:12.881
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:15.070
<v Speaker 1>Photos.</v>

443
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:15.903
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

444
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.440
<v Speaker 1>They turn the car sideways,</v>

445
00:12:17.441 --> 00:12:18.340
<v Speaker 1>turned sideways.</v>

446
00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:19.330
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect lighting.</v>

447
00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:20.164
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>

448
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.020
<v Speaker 1>It even looks like it kind of caught Tam.</v>

449
00:12:22.021 --> 00:12:22.721
<v Speaker 1>And if this is a movie,</v>

450
00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:23.620
<v Speaker 1>I want to be really mad.</v>

451
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm already mad.</v>

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:26.080
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

455
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that these guys were like Andy Kaufman.</v>

456
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.021
<v Speaker 1>They'll just,</v>

457
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:31.150
<v Speaker 1>he's brilliant artists.</v>

458

<v Speaker 1>you're not like that.</v>

460
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:34.240
<v Speaker 1>The quote is so bad.</v>

461
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Speaker 1>This band describes itself as rock stars.</v>

462
00:12:38.411 --> 00:12:39.400
<v Speaker 1>This is all in caps,</v>

463
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:40.540
<v Speaker 1>living on the edge.</v>

464
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.390
<v Speaker 1>They're known for getting crazy and hanging out with their friends.</v>

465
00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

466
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.310
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're known for is this guy.</v>

467
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.173
<v Speaker 1>My neighborhood,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He hangs out with his friends.</v>

471
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.010
<v Speaker 1>That's how you say it.</v>

472
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Like you lived in Glendale though.</v>

473
00:12:53.411 --> 00:12:55.450
<v Speaker 1>If they totally changed the whole sentence,</v>

474
00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:56.490
<v Speaker 1>you'll member walks.</v>

475
00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Doves were living on the edge.</v>

476
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:58.181
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

477
00:12:58.181 --> 00:12:58.720
<v Speaker 1>they're getting,</v>

478
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.840
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to get crazy and hanging with the blue or Flynn's not an Armenian guy.</v>

479
00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:02.201

480
00:13:02.201 --> 00:13:02.601
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

481
00:13:02.601 --> 00:13:04.810
<v Speaker 1>I sense that a Swedish Swedish.</v>

482
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I listen,</v>

485
00:13:06.791 --> 00:13:07.870
<v Speaker 1>I think that these guys,</v>

486
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:08.763
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

487
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:09.040
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

488
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.050
<v Speaker 1>if this is a scam and if this is just a,</v>

489
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.003
<v Speaker 1>a hustle,</v>

490
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.500

<v Speaker 1>I'm on the fence.</v>

492
00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:17.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the fence now.</v>

493
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 1>It's not like if they decided to make a bad band on purpose,</v>

494
00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:21.950
<v Speaker 1>I might think this is pretty fucking,</v>

495
00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 1>if the song was good.</v>

496
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.351
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was saying.</v>

497
00:13:24.351 --> 00:13:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Remember when we went to see that band steel panther?</v>

498
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.361
<v Speaker 1>That was good music.</v>

499
00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Fucking awesome music if you haven't seen those guys.</v>

500
00:13:31.601 --> 00:13:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Steel Panther or this,</v>

501
00:13:32.531 --> 00:13:35.170
<v Speaker 1>they do this like eighties um,</v>

502
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.510
<v Speaker 1>thing where they play like all the,</v>

503
00:13:37.511 --> 00:13:39.710
<v Speaker 1>like the best eighties rock and they,</v>

504
00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.750
<v Speaker 1>the dude does the most insane Ozzy Osborne impression man.</v>

505
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.740
<v Speaker 1>And it's all like hair,</v>

506
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:45.370
<v Speaker 1>metal stuff.</v>

507
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.203
<v Speaker 1>It's all like,</v>

508
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:46.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

509
00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:46.860
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

510
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.100
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

511
00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.130
<v Speaker 1>and it's good man.</v>

512
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:52.990
<v Speaker 1>It's good music but it's like this like hilarious good music parody on.</v>

513
00:13:52.991 --> 00:13:54.910
<v Speaker 1>But you love it because you know they're a fake band,</v>

514
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:55.121
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

515
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:55.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

516
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:56.643
<v Speaker 1>but they're good.</v>

517
00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.060
<v Speaker 1>These guys,</v>

518
00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.350
<v Speaker 1>what if they are fake Ben too?</v>

519
00:13:59.390 --> 00:13:59.720
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

520
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.260
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't do the good part of the music so it doesn't go together.</v>

521
00:14:02.261 --> 00:14:02.981
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work.</v>

522
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:04.720
<v Speaker 1>It has to actually cause cause cause I,</v>

523
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.430
<v Speaker 1>if I liked these guys and I respect,</v>

524
00:14:06.431 --> 00:14:08.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually have to get into their music and I'm not,</v>

526
00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:10.790
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

527
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.690
<v Speaker 1>It's just this brilliant performance piece which just make the worst,</v>

528
00:14:13.691 --> 00:14:14.920
<v Speaker 1>most cliche,</v>

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.800
<v Speaker 1>And we'll do it with like a lot of confidence and let's see if we could sell it.</v>

532
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.240
<v Speaker 1>What if they just want to make friends?</v>

533
00:14:22.241 --> 00:14:23.530
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is just a friend thing.</v>
