00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.250
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about this fight card?</v>

3
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>Got a Fox fight tomorrow night.</v>

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>We're going to come back and watch the fights after I kill a monster buck.</v>

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>It's on the books folks in the cards.</v>

6
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:14.454
<v Speaker 1>I'm making a prediction.</v>

7
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:15.121
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>it's a big fight.</v>

9
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>The main event is huge.</v>

10
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.621
<v Speaker 1>It's high failed.</v>

11
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:23.621
<v Speaker 1>Dos Anjos is the former UFC lightweight champ versus Tony Ferguson who is</v>

12
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>undoubtedly without question one of the best lightweights in the world.</v>

13
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Speaker 1>And the guys have been knocking on the door to a title shot for a while.</v>

14
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>It's a really interesting fight because it highlights a real issue with MMA</v>

15
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:35.994
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

16
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

17
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 1>and that issues weight cutting.</v>

18
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I failed.</v>

19
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

20
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Sandra's had a terrible weight cut for the Eddie Alvarez fight.</v>

21
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm hearing a lot of like conflicting stories,</v>

22
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>but all of them really bad.</v>

23
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Now I shouldn't say conflicting,</v>

24
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I should say a different stories,</v>

25
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>but of what went on when he was making wait for his fight with Eddie Alvarez.</v>

26
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>And apparently he was in bad shape,</v>

27
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>like really bad shape,</v>

28
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:01.530
<v Speaker 1>like barely made wait for that.</v>

29
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.431
<v Speaker 1>And was,</v>

30
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>just really in physical discomfort.</v>

32
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>And pain and just all screwed up from that weight cut.</v>

33
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I think weight cutting is one of the worst aspects of fighting.</v>

34
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be worse than the beatings he's guys take [inaudible] we don't</v>

35
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>see it visually.</v>

36
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't see cuts in their face.</v>

37
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>We don't see knock outs,</v>

38
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>we don't see blood when they're cutting weight.</v>

39
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:27.180
<v Speaker 1>So we don't think of it as the same kind of damage that we do from a beating.</v>

40
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>But I think it might be as bad if not worse.</v>

41
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>I would say worse.</v>

42
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>It could very well be.</v>

43
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>And then even more worse is the fact these guys are dehydrating themselves</v>

44
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:42.801
<v Speaker 1>literally to death's door and then fighting trained killers 24 hours later.</v>

45
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.520
<v Speaker 1>It's unavoidable.</v>

46
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>It's unnecessary.</v>

47
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not unavoidable.</v>

48
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 1>It's avoidable.</v>

49
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>It's unnecessary and it's foolish.</v>

50
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of the most foolish aspects of the,</v>

51
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>for the sport.</v>

52
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.231
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

53
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>we were talking today,</v>

54
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.851
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:01:56.851 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 1>with some of the guys at your camp about um,</v>

56
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>like issues with MMA and with the new owners are going to do,</v>

57
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.940
<v Speaker 1>now that the UFC has been purchased and I hope they institute a program to</v>

59
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 1>eliminate weight cutting.</v>

60
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it is one of the biggest problems and biggest,</v>

61
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>it's a time bomb and it's just waiting to go off in everybody's face.</v>

62
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>And a guy like Hofeld Dosantos who's one of the elite of the elite,</v>

63
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.460
<v Speaker 1>before you lost it,</v>

64
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:24.294
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Alvarez,</v>

65
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people including me,</v>

66
00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>were making the argument that he might be the best lightweight ever.</v>

67
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>You look at a knocked out Benson Henderson,</v>

68
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>he beat the shit out of Nate Diaz.</v>

69
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>He knocked out cowboy Serone in one round.</v>

70
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>He's a fucking monster.</v>

71
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's a killer.</v>

72
00:02:37.961 --> 00:02:41.580
<v Speaker 1>It beat the shit out of Anthony Pettis for five rounds to win the title.</v>

73
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Just rolled him over,</v>

74
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>just beat him down.</v>

75
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

76
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>you can make the argument he's one of the greatest,</v>

77
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.180
<v Speaker 1>certainly one of the greatest light weights of all time might be the best in</v>

78
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:56.181
<v Speaker 1>terms of like champions and the guy was so depleted from his weight cut that he</v>

79
00:02:59.501 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

80
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I heard he's passing out backstage.</v>

81
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

82
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

83
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.241
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

85
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>if that guy died,</v>

86
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 1>what's imagine,</v>

87
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

88
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.741
<v Speaker 1>God forbid,</v>

89
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

90
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>But let's imagine if a guy like that dies because of a weight cut and it has</v>

91
00:03:13.601 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>happened the last week.</v>

92
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.070
<v Speaker 1>The last death in MMA was in Brazil and it was from a fighter who cut weight.</v>

93
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>He died from weight cutting.</v>

94
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>He didn't die from the fight itself.</v>

95
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

96
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a terrible thing that can be eliminated and I think that if we did,</v>

97
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>you would see better fights.</v>

98
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't really what I'm saying,</v>

99
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>I think how,</v>

100
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

101
00:03:34.391 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>someone like that that's having to cut that much,</v>

102
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>are they really,</v>

103
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 1>are you really seeing them at their best?</v>

104
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.811
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

105
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Are Not.</v>

106
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 1>There's no question about it.</v>

107
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I think cowboy looks way better when he's,</v>

108
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>when he's fighting heavier,</v>

109
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.743
<v Speaker 1>much better.</v>

110
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Look how good he looks at one seven.</v>

111
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>I think that's it.</v>

112
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.163
<v Speaker 1>He was always,</v>

113
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>he's always been an elite fighter even at 55 but at one 70 he looks like a world</v>

114
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 1>champion.</v>

115
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

116
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

117
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm waiting to see a title contention right there.</v>

118
00:03:58.751 --> 00:03:59.584
<v Speaker 1>That way.</v>

119
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an old thing.</v>

120
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a thing of the day about Cyborg.</v>

121
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 1>Cause you were telling me what she walks around at one 75.</v>

123
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

124
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.523
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

125
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.581
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

126
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>well Jack does,</v>

127
00:04:10.781 --> 00:04:11.321
<v Speaker 1>she is,</v>

128
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:11.950
<v Speaker 1>how does she,</v>

129
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>how does she cut that much?</v>

130
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean that seems like an impossibility.</v>

131
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.730
<v Speaker 1>She does it sheer strength of will.</v>

132
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.690
<v Speaker 1>George Lockhart,</v>

133
00:04:19.691 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 1>who's her coach,</v>

134
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.590
<v Speaker 1>who's a Oh really,</v>

135
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.910
<v Speaker 1>really high level,</v>

136
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

137
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.860
<v Speaker 1>nutritionist and weight cutting expert and he gets her down to that weight but</v>

138
00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:29.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not pretty,</v>

139
00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:30.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

140
00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:33.060
<v Speaker 1>there's a video of her struggling to make one 40 the,</v>

141
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.700
<v Speaker 1>the weight classes in the UFC for women.</v>

142
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.130
<v Speaker 1>As of right now there's only two,</v>

143
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.340
<v Speaker 1>there is a one 15 and then there's one 35 and they've experimented with one 25</v>

144
00:04:45.151 --> 00:04:47.490
<v Speaker 1>that talked about doing one 25 pound weight classes.</v>

145
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.481
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

146
00:04:48.481 --> 00:04:51.420
<v Speaker 1>like a title at one 25 but as of yet it doesn't exist.</v>

147
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

148
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 1>but I think honestly Cyborg is said that really her best way class classes,</v>

149
00:04:56.921 --> 00:05:00.140
<v Speaker 1>even 45 what she's a champion of an invicta.</v>

150
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Her best way class would be 55.</v>

151
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

152
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:03.331
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

153
00:05:03.331 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

154
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.320
<v Speaker 1>And there's other girls out there man build it and they will come,</v>

155
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I think 55 would be a really good women's class cause you'd almost,</v>

157
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>you could almost have that like Mark Hunt Brock Lesnar's style.</v>

158
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 1>You'd get some real just powerhouses in there that are still not too big where</v>

159
00:05:23.221 --> 00:05:24.180
<v Speaker 1>they're out of shape.</v>

160
00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.500
<v Speaker 1>But they could just,</v>

161
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean they could be like Cyborg.</v>

162
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.530
<v Speaker 1>I think if you built it,</v>

163
00:05:28.531 --> 00:05:32.250
<v Speaker 1>you'd have people coming from other countries that you probably don't even know</v>

164
00:05:32.251 --> 00:05:33.084
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

165
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.660
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

166
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I think you certainly would after a few years.</v>

167
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.370
<v Speaker 1>And that's just an investment that I think they have to make within women's MMA</v>

168
00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:42.204
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

169
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.420
<v Speaker 1>women's MMA is,</v>

170
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 1>is where men's MMA was when the UFC was first purchased.</v>

171
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people don't realize,</v>

172
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 1>but when the UFC bought the,</v>

173
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 1>when they purchased it from the old owners,</v>

174
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.820
<v Speaker 1>they eliminated the 155 pound weight class because a,</v>

175
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.870
<v Speaker 1>they used to have a one 55 then they had a one 70 and then they had,</v>

176
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 1>I think they had a middle weight and a light heavyweight and heavyweight still,</v>

177
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't have anything lower than one 70 so a lot of guys either left the</v>

178
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 1>UFC to fight in other organizations or they moved up to one 70 and competed at</v>

179
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 1>one 70 and some guys were like really oversized or undersized for that weight</v>

180
00:06:20.181 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

181
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.763
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

182
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.170
<v Speaker 1>that's not enough.</v>

183
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>

184
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 1>you mean that it's really important that for a guy like mighty mouse,</v>

185
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 1>like if there wasn't a 125 pound weight class,</v>

186
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 1>which were mighty mouse competes,</v>

187
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't be able to see the best fighter of all time compete in his perfect</v>

188
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:39.920
<v Speaker 1>way class or one 35 you know,</v>

189
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be able to see Dominic Cruz compete at his optimal weight class one</v>

190
00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 1>45 you wouldn't be able to see Josie Aldo going that reign of terror for all</v>

191
00:06:48.111 --> 00:06:48.591
<v Speaker 1>those years.</v>

192
00:06:48.591 --> 00:06:53.591
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be able to see Conor McGregor fight at one 45 and beat Aldo and</v>

193
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:55.850
<v Speaker 1>then 55 54 for the long time,</v>

194
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 1>55 which is one of the most competitive and talent rich divisions in the UFC</v>

195
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:01.280
<v Speaker 1>didn't even exist.</v>

196
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:02.721
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

197
00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 1>so I think that the UFC,</v>

198
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:08.330
<v Speaker 1>if they really want to make that commitment for women's MMA,</v>

199
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:11.660
<v Speaker 1>they should have a full range of weight classes for those girls to compete at.</v>

200
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.100
<v Speaker 1>I think they should start maybe even lower than one 15 I mean you could,</v>

201
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.660
<v Speaker 1>you can make a real strong argument for 105 pound woman's class a one five a one</v>

202
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:25.210
<v Speaker 1>15 to one 25 and then I think really the trend of those 10 pound per weight</v>

203
00:07:25.211 --> 00:07:26.590
<v Speaker 1>class that should exist,</v>

204
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.800
<v Speaker 1>the men's division as well,</v>

205
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 1>there's two big,</v>

206
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.780
<v Speaker 1>the bat that gaps in the men's divisions are way too big.</v>

207
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:35.720
<v Speaker 1>There's one 70 and then there's 15 counts higher.</v>

208
00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:37.100
<v Speaker 1>One 85 that's a big jump.</v>

209
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 1>And then there's 20 pounds above that.</v>

210
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.930
<v Speaker 1>85 to two oh five 20 pounds.</v>

211
00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.140
<v Speaker 1>Think about taking 2016 ounce t boned steaks and that's how much bigger that guy</v>

212
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:49.700
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

213
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 1>Then the guy before him,</v>

214
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.930
<v Speaker 1>then you go to oh five to two 65 so think about taking 60 t bone stage six zero</v>

215
00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 1>it's stacking up and thinking about all the horsepower that comes with all that</v>

216
00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:04.364
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

217
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.533
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

218
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.470
<v Speaker 1>there's too,</v>

219
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:08.450
<v Speaker 1>the gaps are too large.</v>

220
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.070
<v Speaker 1>It's too few weight classes.</v>

221
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.640
<v Speaker 1>So I think the UFC would be,</v>

222
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.990
<v Speaker 1>it would be very smart for them to make more weight classes,</v>

223
00:08:17.991 --> 00:08:21.440
<v Speaker 1>do a weight class every 10 pounds and eliminate the weight cutting if they</v>

224
00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:22.190
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>

225
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.610
<v Speaker 1>And I think it can be done there.</v>

226
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 1>They're probably going to have to get rid of some champions though.</v>

227
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Not Get rid of,</v>

228
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:31.770
<v Speaker 1>but they're going to have to re you going to have to move radio around is</v>

229
00:08:31.771 --> 00:08:32.604
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

230
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.640
<v Speaker 1>And the people who are just samples,</v>

231
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:35.211
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

232
00:08:35.211 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to want to do that.</v>

233
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:36.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

234
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:37.663
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be able to,</v>

235
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.190
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a hard fight to tell a guy like Dominick Cruz,</v>

236
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:41.024
<v Speaker 1>he can't cut weight.</v>

237
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:41.511
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

238
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 1>when he's the world champion and say,</v>

239
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:44.180
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>

240
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:44.831
<v Speaker 1>what do you weigh?</v>

241
00:08:44.831 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Weigh one 55 and you're going to have to fight at one 55.</v>
