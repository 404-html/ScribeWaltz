WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.950
Going to the contender after Freddie Roach.
Yeah.

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.260
Nice live.
Boom.
We're live.
You going to wear headphones or no?
Yeah,

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.600
it's better I get this right.
Do you wear or your cauliflower ears?

4
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:16.890
They keep you from wearing earbuds.

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.090
You know those little things that go in your ear.
Does I need to it?
No,

6
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:23.120
I don't need it.
You don't need it?
I don't know.

7
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.870
I don't have to just keep this goes to your face and we're good.
All right.

8
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.710
There we go.
What's up man?
How are you?
Fantastic.
He'll good.

9
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.300
I feel good.
And I feel that if it wouldn't be for my,
uh,
I like,
uh,

10
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.770
all sort of that ad that I would be if I feel better than,
than I when I was 25.

11
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.520
What did,
what did you have you had colitis?
Yeah.
Called ideas yet.
What is that?

12
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.960
What causes that?
We don't really know what it causes it,
but,

13
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.260
uh,
the best,

14
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.870
the best tre is that,
uh,
before my last fight with Michael Bisping,

15
00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:00.030
I tried to put on weight extra weight.

16
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.830
So I followed a diet program that I was eating every,

17
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:09.630
almost every two hours.
And um,
I think our system is like a car,

18
00:01:09.631 --> 00:01:11.220
you know,
if you do a lot of mileage,

19
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.200
it overuse it and said that's what happened with distress and everything.

20
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.390
During my training camp at big problem,
you know,

21
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:23.070
I couldn't sleep at crazy cramps,
you know,
sometimes add blood.

22
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.380
Even when I went to the bathroom at one point I had to go do some tests because

23
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:31.830
I was worried that it was something more like,
I mean it's,

24
00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:32.880
collider is very serious,

25
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:36.390
but that it was like cancer or something because he had blood.

26
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.920
So I did some tests.
It came out and they get to live and I said to myself,

27
00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.650
I said,
this fight been delayed,
delayed,

28
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:47.060
but postponed so many times that if I do something I,

29
00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:49.830
if I say that perfectly,
what is going on,

30
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.940
I'm going to lose the opportunity to fight for the title at one 85.

31
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.890
So I keep it shut and I told myself,
said it,
whatever it is,

32
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:02.850
I'll deal with it after the fight.
So I did the fight.
Everything went well.

33
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:05.910
Then after I went to do a,
it's called a colonoscopy,

34
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:08.430
they put a camera inside of you and I did.

35
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.590
I got diagnosed with ulcerative colitis.

36
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.960
That's probably the mix of distress and also the,

37
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.980
the fact that I was constantly eating,
I was eating and not only eating Joe,

38
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:20.140
I was trying to put on some weight.
It was very hard.
Sometime I was,

39
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.340
I remember many times I was having breakfast but I was regurgitating,

40
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.870
regurgitating my breakfast.

41
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.480
Oh like chewing up cause you're just eating too much food,

42
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.870
but add to it because I needed to keep my seven a certain weight and definitely

43
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.170
the crazy thing about it is first not realize it's a mistake.

44
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:38.100
I should never have done it,

45
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.700
but when I made the weight at the one 85 the day before the fight,

46
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.100
I could not go back up to a one 90 that's a,

47
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.060
the higher side was going back up so that they have that fight.
I,

48
00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.320
I woke up and I added a little breakfast.
I chew up my breakfast again.
Wow.

49
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.530
Yeah.
Wait,
I was really messed up.
Then I went to weigh myself.

50
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:02.980
I was like one 91 wow.
Yeah.
And what do you think Mike Wade,

51
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.110
you felt very strong.
I mean it's not really the weight at this time because

52
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.340
the way that you weigh right now,
depending on what you eat,

53
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.480
you have a lot of stuff inside your,
your,
your intestine and everything.
So you,

54
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:18.010
and also water retention.

55
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.320
I felt like add a lot of water retention and um,
unnecessary weight.

56
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.130
Yeah,
exactly.
So it's like dead weight.

57
00:03:25.131 --> 00:03:26.980
It's like a bag that you would carry it on your shoulder show.

58
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:30.640
What I should have done,
I think is just stay the same way that I am.

59
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.630
My natural weight.

60
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:36.631
I think the buddy has a way that it's best way to perform an athletic

61
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:41.500
performance and that's what I should have done.
But it was a mistake of my part.

62
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:42.460
It was a big mistake.

63
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:45.280
So you were just thinking that because you're going up to one 85 and you're

64
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:48.760
fighting a guy in Bisbing that used to fight at two oh five.
Exactly.

65
00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:53.740
It's a pretty big guy.
Exactly.
That I taught that to,
to perform better.

66
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:57.280
I needed to elevate my weight.
But by doing that,
I create,

67
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.540
I create the big problem of [inaudible] healthy.
She was so,
and that,

68
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.900
that colitis didn't exist before that,
eh,

69
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.660
not that I got diagnosed for no,
no,
at being that,

70
00:04:09.661 --> 00:04:12.340
that's what trigger it.
And so after the fight,

71
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.480
now they've gone back to a normal diet.
Has it changed?
So,
so after that fight,

72
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.240
what happened?
And it's very interesting too,

73
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.080
I got an on medication and I met the doctor that his name is Jason Fung is

74
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.410
intermodal people can research,
has this amazing,
amazing guy.

75
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.270
And I met a doctor that,

76
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.300
that treat people with cancer and diabetes with a intermitted fasting.

77
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.840
So I started doing a program of intermitted fasting and time restricted eating

78
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.880
and all my symptoms diminish like every,
every week,
every month diminish.

79
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.680
So he's got,
it's getting better.
It's not 100% now,
but he's getting a lot better,

80
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.000
a lot better.
And I fill out a lot better.
A lot of people eat like that.
Now.

81
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:58.930
We had Ben Greenfield on yesterday who,
uh,
you know,
he's a,

82
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.500
a journalist,
does a lot of experimenting with his body,
thought a lot,

83
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.910
a lot of scientific stuff and it scientific,
uh,
uh,

84
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.790
research on diet and restricted eating is a big part of it.

85
00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:10.660
He does a lot of that.

86
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.700
It's interesting because we're conditioned to think that,
oh,
I want to,

87
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.530
I want to gain muscle,
don't want to get,
you know,

88
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:20.080
I need to eat more to accelerate my metabolism.

89
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.260
But I never felt better in my life if we would not be for that particular issue.

90
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:30.010
I feel better now.
I sleep better.
Uh,
I,
uh,

91
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.060
inflammation and I'll also did a test in January.

92
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:38.980
I went to McGill university to do a scan of my,
uh,
my weight,

93
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.580
my purse,
my fat person at age,
my,
uh,
muscle density,

94
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.590
bone density and my,
I'm in five months.
I did it that few days ago,

95
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:52.510
like not letting that this week,
the Tuesday of that last week and my,
uh,

96
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.570
my fat person,
that dish has a decrease.

97
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.900
My muscle mass has and my weight is at the same.

98
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.370
Then it was in January.
And you think this is all from restricted eating?
My,

99
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.230
my training didn't that have to change?

100
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.240
So they only thing has changed pretty much is the,
the,
the,

101
00:06:09.241 --> 00:06:13.840
the restricted restricted at time eating and interpreted.

102
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:14.960
Fascinating.
Yes.
Yeah.

103
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:18.950
That intermittent fasting gives your digestive system a break and it lets your

104
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:20.120
body recuperate better.

105
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.440
I think that that's what had helped me out a that mostly I think that's what it

106
00:06:24.441 --> 00:06:29.030
is a it I felt like I was like,
like I,
like I said,
like a car,

107
00:06:29.031 --> 00:06:33.350
I was putting too much for nothing.
And I think as human being,
we're overfed.

108
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:38.280
I,
uh,
I'm very interested about paleontology and,
and also,
uh,

109
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.851
his story.

110
00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:43.851
And I know that human being in anther gatherer time then that eat three meals a

111
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:47.810
day.
No,
they,
they maybe a few times a week.

112
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.620
But when they eat they eat a lot because I need to do with fat.

113
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:56.050
So I think it's more natural for a human being to do so.
And also,
I,

114
00:06:56.051 --> 00:06:59.330
I now I read a lot of stuff and I watch a lot of stuff on the Internet.

115
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:02.240
How about intermittent fasting and time restricted aid eating.

116
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.950
And I just wish I knew that before,
uh,
for so many years.
I,

117
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.810
I used to follow the rules are we need to eat at least three times a day.
And,

118
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.540
you know,
I don't really care of what I eat,
but I,
I've,

119
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.400
even though in the morning I w I was not hungry.
I was always,

120
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:23.470
am I forcing myself to eat,
which is bad,
you know?
Yeah.
What,

121
00:07:23.471 --> 00:07:25.910
what has changed in your diet?
Like what do you eat?
Like what's a,

122
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:29.360
what's a normal meal for you?
Ah,
no,
I don't really,

123
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.250
I don't really watch what I eat and Mr I,
I,
it's more a,

124
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:38.400
when I eat,
uh,
I tried to eat the Lt,
but I don't have a specific diet.

125
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.930
Like for example,
like,
oh,
she was the,
I'm going to eat this,
this,
this,

126
00:07:41.931 --> 00:07:46.710
that's on how it works.
Uh,
I just tried to eat lt,
you know,
like I,

127
00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:52.010
I,
I tried to eat good and,
uh,
of course I don't look at,
oh,
there's a desert.

128
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.830
I'm,
you know,
if I wanted the SR chocolate,
I'll,

129
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.860
I'll get them over that from one of your old videos,

130
00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:00.710
like you were having a glass of wine during training camp.
You're like,
oh,

131
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.250
so wasn't wrong.
One glass of wine while they think about it,
it,

132
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.740
I don't think glass of wine or anything,

133
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.930
let you know before I fight where we have the tendency to be too much.

134
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:16.250
Like,
oh,
what should I eat?
What should I do this,
they should I do that?

135
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:20.420
I think it's,
man,
it's a tense to 10.
So I've met,

136
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.190
when I went to in Thailand,
I met some,

137
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.210
some world champion Thai boxer and they smoked.

138
00:08:26.211 --> 00:08:29.890
They get drunk before the fight.
I'm like,
you're fighting tomorrow man.
It's like,

139
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.590
it's like,
ah.
It's like,
it's no problem.
But when you think about it,

140
00:08:33.591 --> 00:08:36.900
this is an extreme.
This is to the other extreme.
Yes.

141
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.590
But I don't think it as that much of an effect at,
you know what I would,

142
00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:45.320
I used to eat before like before a fight,
my meal of choice,

143
00:08:45.321 --> 00:08:49.670
before I got into reading about,
uh,

144
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.750
eating and stuff like that.
I was eating a pastor before,
uh,

145
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:57.570
before fight most of my fat.
I like fit to fit two cine Alfredo.

146
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.080
Hi again.
That's a lot of carbs.
I mean it seems like not that bad.
I mean it's,

147
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.010
it's not bad,
but I,
if you eat,
if you talk to her,
for example,

148
00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:09.210
a nutritionist will be like,
oh my God,
it will grab his head will be you serious.

149
00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:13.220
So my dice and you state that see Steeda steak and pasta before his fights,
that,

150
00:09:13.221 --> 00:09:13.951
that was my thing.

151
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:17.760
I used sweet pass all the time and then there's no problem with that for me.

152
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.460
And I felt great.
But since I,

153
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:25.350
I start reading about nutrition and stuff like that,
it's like,

154
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:28.890
oh,
you need to eat clean and an m like it never affect me.

155
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.040
I don't think it as that much of a big,
big effect.
You know,

156
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:33.690
it's more psychological I think.

157
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.110
Well it's also you think about how much energy you're burning and I think for

158
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:39.570
the average person,
a bowl of pasta is not a good idea.

159
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.660
But for an athlete that's about to fight five,

160
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:46.020
five minute rounds against a world class fighter,

161
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.810
the ut of different energy requirements,
you know,

162
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:52.230
you have different nutrition requirements,
you can burn off way more fuel.

163
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.441
You know,

164
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:55.800
like I was listening to Chad Mendez and a podcast the other day and he was

165
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:57.690
talking about how he's so hungry.

166
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.810
He eats so much that he has to wakes up in the middle of the night and he goes

167
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:02.790
and eats sometimes.
Wow.
He just can't.

168
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:06.480
He can't go a couple of hours without eating.
He just has this crazy metabolism.

169
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.280
You know what says?
I discover time restricted eating and intermittent fasting.

170
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:16.370
Now I feel better by a training with an empty stomach and sharper up here.

171
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.450
I feel more creative,
especially in Jujitsu.

172
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.430
I feel better if the lighter on my feet.

173
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.660
You do like first Jiu Jitsu class in the morning?
No,

174
00:10:26.661 --> 00:10:29.670
no food in your stomach and never have a food.
I haven't eat today.
This isn't,

175
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:32.700
but the coffee you give me is the first thing I have.
So when will you eat?

176
00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:35.640
It's 1224 right after this.
I'm gonna.

177
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:40.530
I'm going to go train with Freddie Roach and then I'm an elite and AI and maybe

178
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:44.070
I'll eat another time.
I,
I'm a late eater.
That's one thing.

179
00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.240
I'm not too good and I don't like to eat too much earlier during the day and

180
00:10:48.241 --> 00:10:52.890
they're really hungry.
I used to eat because everybody eat.
But now I'm an I,

181
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.990
I'm not gonna eat this as I have.
I've discovered this.
I don't eat when I,

182
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.833
when I'm not hungry.

183
00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:02.190
And the thing is why people eat is because they're a spike of insulin,
you know?

184
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:07.110
So when you like when I started doing intermittent fasting and time restricted

185
00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:07.890
eating,

186
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.760
it was hard in the beginning because I was conditioned to eat all the time,

187
00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:17.010
but my buddy acclimate to it and now it's very easy.
I can eat once a day.

188
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:19.980
It's no problem.
Like right now,
you know,
I could do it.

189
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.290
And I think it's good to be hungry in a way that I remembered.

190
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.590
A doctor has said something to me.
He said,
would you rather be like,
uh,
uh,

191
00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.630
a lion that just,
uh,

192
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:35.220
add a full belly or an angry lion?
I'm like,
as a fighter,

193
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.890
I'd rather it be like a hungry lion and it makes sense to me.

194
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.820
If you look at nature,
it makes sense.
You know what I mean?
It doesn't make sense.

195
00:11:41.821 --> 00:11:44.310
Especially when you do time restricted eating,
your,

196
00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:48.600
your body gets used to burning off fat too and using fat as fuel.
It's true.

197
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.290
It's true.
That's why I think when I did the test to compare my,
uh,

198
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.070
my phot percent,

199
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.490
<v 1>they just diminish and I dealt with have much fat but it diminished.</v>

200
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.340
And the doctor I met,
uh,
east,
I says to him and said,
yeah,
again,

201
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.110
a lot of weight.
He said,
you handled,
you think I'm going to lose muscle.

202
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:08.470
He says to me,
he believed that the way that I put on,

203
00:12:08.471 --> 00:12:13.450
because now I'm about 185 pounds.
And I,
when I joined for Bisping,

204
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:18.160
I went up to 197.
And when I,
after,
after their way and I was,

205
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.220
I couldn't put back that weight up to wasn't 190.

206
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.500
He believed that the extra weight that ad was more water retention and um,

207
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.990
residual inside my and my buddy,

208
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:34.110
it was not like a solid mass and it makes sense to me because now I feel much

209
00:12:34.151 --> 00:12:36.640
better and I'm just as strong and even stronger.

210
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:41.320
Like when I do Olympic lifting much stronger,
I'll a gymnastic much longer.

211
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.400
Like I feel sharper.
Yeah.
And you said it reduced your inflammation as well?

212
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.070
It does.
Avid sometime elbows,

213
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:52.150
you know like you used to have always that big inflated elbow.
Yes.

214
00:12:52.151 --> 00:12:54.860
Swollen elbow.
What was that a was a

215
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.500
bursitis or birthday.
It was my birthday.

216
00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.670
That was during my fight of the Jaguar vets,
but the,

217
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:06.120
I got to get a surgery to take her with the,
there is a draw the bone,

218
00:13:06.121 --> 00:13:07.630
a chip inside my elbow,

219
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:12.640
isn't it from landing elbows or I think is just use users using it.

220
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:16.570
But now I don't have any problem anymore.
I don't want to feel like,

221
00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:20.800
it used to be be a chronic thing that I used to feel some once in a while.

222
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:25.510
Sometimes it came and it goes,
but since I started this,
it didn't game at all.

223
00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:29.140
I felt great.
I can touch my hair,
my to shoulder like this.
No.
Came back.

224
00:13:29.141 --> 00:13:33.100
It's very interesting because with a lot of people they take time off and then

225
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:36.340
they come back and you wonder what they're going to look like.

226
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:40.720
But one of the things that I was very hopeful with you is that you've always

227
00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:45.721
been almost a martial artist first and a fight or second and that you're always

228
00:13:47.231 --> 00:13:49.620
learning and you're always practicing like you will.

229
00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:53.220
You would always take time in between camps and you would,
you know,

230
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:57.500
do Jujitsu in Brazil or you would be constantly practicing your Moitai.

231
00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.770
You're always trying to learn and improve your game.

232
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.810
And I was thinking when you came back and was like,

233
00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:04.900
if you were saying that you are better than ever,
I'm like man,

234
00:14:04.901 --> 00:14:07.060
he might be better than ever.
Like you.

235
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:10.570
You were willing to one guy that I believed because a lot of times guys come

236
00:14:10.571 --> 00:14:13.990
back and like,
man,
he's been out of the game a long time.

237
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.680
Who knows how hard he's been training because a lot of fighters when they're not

238
00:14:17.681 --> 00:14:20.380
in camp,
when they're not preparing for a fight,
they don't,

239
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.410
they don't like to train that much cause they,
they the,
the,

240
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:26.290
the grind of camp almost.
Where's I'm like,

241
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.200
you know how you see a lot of fighters after they retire,
they get really fat.

242
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.480
Yeah.
And you're like,
wow,
how could he get fat?

243
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.470
Like I was looking at my Donna the other day,
there's a picture of my Donna's um,

244
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.690
uh,
Chino,
Mondo Madonna.
He's got a Instagram page.
He's fat as fuck.

245
00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.270
He's got a sick car.
He's drinking a whiskey.
Me,

246
00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:47.170
he just fought Floyd Mayweather a couple of years ago.
He was ripped and this,

247
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.030
they retire.
They don't give a fuck anymore though.

248
00:14:49.031 --> 00:14:52.310
I don't want to do this anymore.
But you,
I knew you were still

249
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.280
<v 0>training cause I would see like an the Henzel Gracie,</v>

250
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.790
the guys who were training with you there and I knew you were training with

251
00:14:58.791 --> 00:15:01.670
Donna her.
I knew you were constantly training and you look good.

252
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:06.770
So I was like that when I left off like more than four years ago.
I,
uh,

253
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.790
I knew I wanted it to come back.
Uh,
the guy was not in an APP.

254
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:15.791
You place had a lot of personal problems and I should have even stopped earlier

255
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:20.000
than that after my fight with Hendricks.
If,
if I would have stopped earlier,

256
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:24.020
I would have maybe come back earlier as well.
Uh,
it was,

257
00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:25.843
I was,

258
00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:31.430
I felt like I was like kind of a feeling of a cluster claustrophobic feeling,

259
00:15:31.431 --> 00:15:34.660
you know,
like it,
I was,
I couldn't breathe well.
I couldn't sleep well.
I,

260
00:15:34.661 --> 00:15:39.140
in my mind,
I too much pressure or personal problem.
There's so much stuff,

261
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:43.340
a lot of stuff happened to me that it's still too early in my life and for the

262
00:15:43.341 --> 00:15:45.950
respect of some people I know I couldn't talk about it.

263
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.770
One day I will all mixed together.

264
00:15:48.771 --> 00:15:53.600
I knew it was a drug issue in the sport.
I feel,
I felt it.

265
00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.570
I did filter well and uh,

266
00:15:55.571 --> 00:16:00.571
I was trying to perform under those condition and it was catching up to me and,

267
00:16:00.801 --> 00:16:02.120
um,
I did it.

268
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.550
But the reason why I think I didn't lose the edge is a lot of people,

269
00:16:07.551 --> 00:16:09.410
because we do an extreme sport,

270
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:14.710
it's like what we do is kind of a life and death situation.

271
00:16:14.781 --> 00:16:18.490
It's not because there's a referee,
but the spirit is the same as a gladiator,

272
00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:23.450
gladiator or a person in a war that goes toward,
he thinks he's going to die,

273
00:16:23.451 --> 00:16:25.720
is the same spirit,
even though he's not as anything.

274
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.670
But we'll go over there and the same spirit they were ready to give it or give

275
00:16:28.671 --> 00:16:33.671
it all is such an extreme feeling that wants.

276
00:16:33.681 --> 00:16:38.090
You don't have that,
then your life life kind of become boring.

277
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.320
You feel like you're not alive anymore.
So that's why when people step,

278
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.870
they retired and I tried to come back.

279
00:16:44.871 --> 00:16:48.680
A lot of the people they fall into drugs because I want to catch up to that.

280
00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.630
They want to feel alive again.
So they want,

281
00:16:50.631 --> 00:16:54.350
they need that sensation that they add previously,

282
00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:56.750
but I couldn't get it back.

283
00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.310
And as they do drugs or they do something crazy extravagant,

284
00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.440
the thing with me is I knew I was going to come back.
Uh,

285
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:10.160
and also I always like to train and keep myself in shape and I never did drugs.

286
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:14.350
You know,
like I never did drugs.
I drink,
I drink sometime.

287
00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.870
If my birthday last Saturday I went out and I was completely wasted.
Okay.

288
00:17:17.871 --> 00:17:21.980
It is what it is.
I like to deter rate myself sometime.
I'm not perfect.

289
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:25.550
Just have a little fun.
Exactly.
And I,
what's the goal of doing this?

290
00:17:25.551 --> 00:17:28.220
If you're not enjoying her life?
What's the goal of it?
Right.

291
00:17:28.221 --> 00:17:30.830
And no people to fight.
It's like,
no,
I don't like to fight.

292
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:35.640
And that was another thing I liked to talk to you about people's like what do

293
00:17:35.641 --> 00:17:37.640
you do that if you don't like to fight?
And it's like,

294
00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:40.640
because I like my lifestyle,
you know,
that it gives me,

295
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.820
but that's why people I believe will come back to what you would say.

296
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.770
That's why I think people,

297
00:17:45.771 --> 00:17:48.650
they have a hard time to come back after so many years because they fall into

298
00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:51.810
that they need to feel alive.
So they,
they,

299
00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.110
they find ways to make them feel alive.
But it's the,

300
00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:00.220
it's the interior.
They tell you your rate themselves neither.

301
00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.300
I didn't do that.
I did not do that and I wouldn't never will.

302
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.880
Hopefully it's not my thing,
you know?

303
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:11.140
So when you decided to come back,
how far out did you decide?
Like,
but you,

304
00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:15.300
you,
you took four years off.
How many years in where you were like,

305
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.770
I think I'm ready to come back.
Uh,

306
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:23.810
when I see USA USA DEA and the drug testing program being implemented and

307
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:30.860
implemented,
then I saw a lot of deflate.
Yes.

308
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.050
You feel like it.

309
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.940
Did you feel vindicated when you saw like some of these people just,

310
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.410
I feel a little bit of a,

311
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:42.500
I mean it feels bad to wish people bad luck to get some kind of recognition,

312
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:46.230
but that's not what I want.
I want to do.
I don't wish people bad luck,

313
00:18:46.231 --> 00:18:50.970
but if you cheat,
you cheat man.
And they,
lot of people get cut.
And finally,

314
00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.430
a lot of people in the beginning,
including my own friend,

315
00:18:53.431 --> 00:18:56.580
they think like I was talking to some of my own friend that they say,
oh,

316
00:18:56.581 --> 00:19:00.150
you're paranoid.
You become paranoid.
You need to take a break.
You,

317
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:05.220
you're going crazy.
Just retire or get out.
[inaudible] you're paranoid.

318
00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.680
Because I was talking about it a long time before Hendrix and they had,

319
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.670
everybody was disregarding me but not in when it happened.

320
00:19:11.671 --> 00:19:16.671
A lot of it that champion fell and then a lot of the role in the sport,

321
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.700
they got pointed out with the fingers,
hey,
he's a cheater.

322
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.750
So now it become real.
So when I saw that happen,
it was,

323
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:29.340
it was for me a beginning to start and now it's time to come back.
You know,

324
00:19:29.341 --> 00:19:32.220
because I'm,
I'm a guy have of,
uh,

325
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.540
if I said something,
you know,
that's become going to,
I'm going to do it.

326
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.960
I didn't want to come back when the sport was dirty.
That's one of my thing.

327
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.710
And so when I,
when I,
the site to come back,

328
00:19:43.711 --> 00:19:47.780
I had a big talk with one of my trainer,
John Than Rna and Ferris,

329
00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:51.660
there were my two main guy and they're like my friend,
I brought her with me.

330
00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.500
I mean I'm undefeated with these,
with these two guys,
you know,
and they,

331
00:19:55.501 --> 00:19:56.334
they're like,

332
00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:00.450
well I need them when I fight series knowledge between those two men and they

333
00:20:00.451 --> 00:20:04.380
mixed together is crazy.
You know,
there are two different person,
very different.

334
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.380
They both have a um,
um,

335
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.590
they both studied philosophy.

336
00:20:10.591 --> 00:20:14.850
It a variant and trusting people for me to talk with because I have two

337
00:20:14.851 --> 00:20:19.800
different mentalities,
you know,
they see the world different ways.

338
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.600
So I like to,
to have both of their expertise and um,

339
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.060
so John,
John,
he told me,
he said,
listen,

340
00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.600
he said you always have tree big criticizing,

341
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.440
criticize us when you were fighting.
It just never went up.

342
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.230
A weight class you never,
you,

343
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:41.910
you people say is that you kind of borrowing or too much cerebral with
technical.

344
00:20:41.911 --> 00:20:42.210
You,

345
00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:47.040
you don't want to take on SSA rerelease which make the fight boring and also you

346
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:51.610
finish your appointment.
You know,
that was one of my big criticizing criticizes.

347
00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.990
I decide to come back and we change our,
um,

348
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.890
the way I was training because that the way you train reflects the way you
fight.

349
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.760
You know,
people say,
Oh,
I'm gonna,
I'm not gonna train too hard,

350
00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:05.950
I'm going to do this and training,
but when I,
it's time to five,

351
00:21:05.951 --> 00:21:07.930
I'm going to step up.
There is no step up.

352
00:21:07.931 --> 00:21:12.630
You're just gonna do what what you did everyday,
you know,
investment.

353
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.900
So I decide to change a few things and uh,

354
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:19.000
to correct those three things and that's what happened.
And you know,
I'm,
I'm,

355
00:21:19.001 --> 00:21:22.420
I'm happy it worked.
It worked out well,
but that was my goal.

356
00:21:22.421 --> 00:21:26.590
I wanted to come back for something that excite me,
something that was different,

357
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.780
something that was unique and rare,
you know,
and,

358
00:21:30.781 --> 00:21:34.750
and I didn't want to come back to do the same thing I was doing before and

359
00:21:34.751 --> 00:21:39.130
that's why I decided to come back.
When you came back,
first of all,

360
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:41.380
you came back and fought a very tough guy,
right?

361
00:21:41.381 --> 00:21:45.790
You fought a big Michael Bisping at 185 pounds.
But what was impressive to me,

362
00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:49.000
it's like you,
you didn't look like you were gone.
Like,

363
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:53.230
like right away you,
it felt like you felt right back into the groove again.

364
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:54.490
You didn't look out of place,

365
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.720
you didn't look uncomfortable and you were showing things,

366
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:02.650
especially different things with your kicking and your movement that we hadn't

367
00:22:02.651 --> 00:22:05.890
seen from you before.
Like you looked like you had improved.

368
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:09.720
I was tested and then the training,
uh,

369
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.020
even Ferris,

370
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.410
some of the guys for the rest went to tell them like he whispered to them as,

371
00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:17.680
hey,
if you knocked out with George inspiring,
I'll give you money.
Or you know,

372
00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.500
things like,
yeah,
man,
he's crazy.
He's crazy.

373
00:22:21.501 --> 00:22:25.060
If I rest is my worst enemy in training sometimes,
you know,
he tell Diet,

374
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.000
he tells people,
it's like,
hey,
if you,
if you beat Jay for you heard George,

375
00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:32.110
I'm going to glorify you.
You know,
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna.
Wow.

376
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.760
I'm going to talk about you and you know,
hey,

377
00:22:33.761 --> 00:22:36.610
we're going to be IP because that's the opposite of what a lot of people think

378
00:22:36.611 --> 00:22:39.930
of training camp should be for a champion.
It depends on what kind of,
you know,

379
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.030
we don't train like this everyday,
but for my heart sparing,
I've,

380
00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.340
when I'm training for a fight of two days,
uh,

381
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.950
for my last training camp at two days that it was like hard sparring that was

382
00:22:50.951 --> 00:22:54.160
called,
we called it shoot bucks.
Fight should shoot bucks fighting,

383
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:59.170
which we put the big loves the Shin Pad and his feet to floor.

384
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.010
Once we touched the floor we stop and we go back up.

385
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.330
And that was the area of expertise.
We're Bisping was the most uh,
uh,

386
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:09.183
competent.

387
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:14.310
The striking department he's going to at that floor is why I uh,
I,

388
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.580
I was,
I was,

389
00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:20.230
I was bringing in a lot of good guys for aspiring with Mia and in,
in that,

390
00:23:20.231 --> 00:23:21.790
that and that particular training,

391
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:26.560
it's hard to find someone that is exactly like,
like are you going to fight?

392
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:31.180
But you can find that guy that does things better than him in that particular

393
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.500
area.
You know,

394
00:23:32.501 --> 00:23:37.150
I cannot find a replica of Michael Bisping was complete as much as Michael

395
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:41.710
Bisping fight.
Again,
find a guy,
for example,
I gave for coming from Spain is,

396
00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:42.800
his name is Cesar.

397
00:23:42.801 --> 00:23:47.720
He's a k one fighter and he's big guy like 205 pounds and he's big and he's just

398
00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:50.660
very,
very good kickbox so,
so add him.
During my training camp,

399
00:23:50.661 --> 00:23:54.890
I flew him from Spain at a different bunch of guys that I,
that I,

400
00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:59.310
that I was training with and all of these guys that I was training with there

401
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.590
are not like Michael Bisping,

402
00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.910
but in a certain area that I was training with them.

403
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.950
It could be grappling or Shush,

404
00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.860
shush should box or a different different area there.

405
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.110
There could be just as good or maybe better than Michael Bisping.

406
00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:20.030
So that's how I do my training camp.
You know,
I remember when you brought,

407
00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.980
how do you say his last name?
[inaudible] not Charlotte Scott Buskey.

408
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.670
Yeah.
When you are that character,
the character in deed,

409
00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.960
when you brought him to work with you on the ultimate fighter and he would be

410
00:24:32.961 --> 00:24:37.460
partying all night drunk and show up at the gym the next day and still fuck

411
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:40.200
everybody up.
Yeah.
And did that

412
00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.150
influence your,
this,

413
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.280
your idea about just being more relaxed and training and just not worrying about

414
00:24:49.281 --> 00:24:52.580
it as much?
Yeah,
but he's at the front.
Like it,

415
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:55.640
it's a total different extreme,
you know,
like,

416
00:24:55.641 --> 00:25:00.140
like I don't believe in that extreme,
but Scholly.
Yeah.

417
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.440
I remember the producer of their show with the ultimate fighter when he was,

418
00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.710
is how about you were supposed to stay one week.
And when he was about to say,

419
00:25:06.711 --> 00:25:08.090
the producer was telling me,
hey,

420
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.860
can we keep him for the rest of their show because it was a good TV,
you know,

421
00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:16.830
so I'm like,
I don't know,
I'm going to ask him.
And,
and the in the same time,

422
00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:20.750
like it,
a lot of the people in my thing,
they were like,
man,
okay,
that's enough.

423
00:25:20.751 --> 00:25:24.190
Now we got what we need and that,
and I was like,
yeah,
I like him,

424
00:25:24.191 --> 00:25:25.670
but he's just kind of a,
you know what,

425
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.000
I need to kind of babysit them and this idea of dying.

426
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:33.010
But the knowledge that this guy ad and he gave us was just a big,

427
00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.670
a big edge,
you know?
And,
um,
but as I shot is a different extreme.

428
00:25:40.671 --> 00:25:44.510
A Joe I take there is a center line that you need to keep,
you know,

429
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.460
uh,
that's what I believe.
I believe in life.
It's not white.
It's not black.

430
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:54.230
It's always grade there.
There's middle zone for everything I believe.
Yeah.
No,

431
00:25:54.231 --> 00:25:56.630
I think you're right about that.
So when you,

432
00:25:56.631 --> 00:26:00.240
when you have a camp and you set up a camp and you have Donna,
her and for Ross,

433
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:03.650
did they essentially,
uh,
or they are the architects of the whole camp,

434
00:26:03.651 --> 00:26:06.740
do they get together and try to figure out what you're doing and when you're

435
00:26:06.741 --> 00:26:09.140
doing it and how is for Ross,

436
00:26:09.141 --> 00:26:12.500
the guy who handles like more of the striking aspects of it or putting the

437
00:26:12.501 --> 00:26:14.470
grappling and the striking together?
I,

438
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.350
I am a little bit the head guy in a way.
You know,
I,

439
00:26:18.351 --> 00:26:22.160
I believe as a fighter you need to be the guy.
You're,
you're the maestro.

440
00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.670
We have the people that work like with you and,
and,

441
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:30.890
but that you need to know how to use these people.
Good.
For instance,

442
00:26:30.891 --> 00:26:34.280
I don't know nothing about business,
but I have uh,

443
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:38.030
agents that are there to Nigga shade five day.
Dave knows number,

444
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.590
they know a lot about the investment.

445
00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.830
I have one to another guy he knows about fiscally is a,

446
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.900
is a lawyer in a is good for a tax report.

447
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:50.280
I don't know nothing but I know how to get the good people to help me for that

448
00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.530
particular thing.
Right,
right,
right.

449
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:56.750
So Ferris and Joan for me are the most competent people that I can have to help

450
00:26:57.481 --> 00:27:01.320
me going to fight someone because in John,

451
00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:04.650
especially in the grapping area,
but Johnny is known he and grabbing

452
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:09.990
the difference with John and Feras,
that makes them very unique as trainers.

453
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:14.910
They not really on the trainers that are teachers and I would say the same thing

454
00:27:14.911 --> 00:27:15.840
about Freddie Roach.

455
00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.930
Same thing about free road down and you train or their teachers.

456
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.400
The way I structure my,
my training camp there is like a pyramid.

457
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:29.290
The first layer,
the fund,
the,
the,
the,
the,

458
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.210
the fundamental.
The foundation is physical.

459
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.400
Are you in shape?
Are you a zero?
We are vo two Max.

460
00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.950
Are you in shape?
Are you in good condition,
no injuries,

461
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.950
athleticism or you are an athlete or you're a good,
good athlete.

462
00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.510
Does that physical layer,
this is the wider one.
Does the the bottom one,

463
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:52.830
it's like a pyramid.
Then it goes up one layer.
The technical layer.

464
00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:56.340
Do you know what to do with your knowledge?
Do you know a non bar,

465
00:27:56.670 --> 00:28:01.050
a defense to a triangle,
choke out to counter a jab or I'll,

466
00:28:01.051 --> 00:28:05.210
do you know what the technical aspect or not in terms of knowledge of fighting,

467
00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:09.510
that's where the trainer comes into play.
Also the physical,

468
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.480
the technical and a lot of the trainer,

469
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:16.380
they don't have the last layer or down the,

470
00:28:16.381 --> 00:28:20.160
I have one of those or two of those,
but they don't want to have the tree layers.

471
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:25.470
That's where a fire as John and also I would say free Freddie and boxing comes

472
00:28:25.471 --> 00:28:28.830
into play,
but in MMA,
especially for us and John,

473
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.950
the tactical layer,
which is the last one,

474
00:28:31.951 --> 00:28:36.810
that's what separate contenders and champion.
There's a physical,

475
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:41.040
the technical and the technical.
Let's say we're equal.

476
00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.440
We're the same person.

477
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:47.100
What can I make the difference between me winning against who are you winning

478
00:28:47.101 --> 00:28:49.380
against?
Me As a tactical because we're the same person.

479
00:28:49.381 --> 00:28:51.530
We're a complete replica word.

480
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:56.350
We're a clone that the difference is the tactical.
I will know how,

481
00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:01.110
where I can take you out of your comfort zone and I can bring the fight where

482
00:29:01.111 --> 00:29:04.890
I'm the strongest and and fight you to eliminate.

483
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:09.920
Eliminate The ads word that the fight we're will s was strobe.

484
00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:14.870
The odds of me winning to my advantage.
That's where John and Ferris,

485
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.010
our master at this and Freddie Roach,

486
00:29:17.011 --> 00:29:21.930
he's a master at this unboxing and that's why I'm so,
I feel just very,

487
00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.860
very lucky to have these guy on with me in,
in,

488
00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:30.930
in my corner because they,
they,
they,
they are competent in these tree layers.

489
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.860
Physical technique,
technical and tactical,

490
00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:39.050
which most strainer can have only one,
two or maybe they,

491
00:29:39.051 --> 00:29:43.830
they don't have trees.
Very rare to find,
treat those,
the trainer who can do that,

492
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:47.170
these thing.
So when you get to the tactical layer,

493
00:29:47.171 --> 00:29:50.320
is this something that you all agree on?
Do you discuss it?

494
00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:54.440
Like when we are approaching a fight,
like say Michael Bisping,
like what?

495
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.410
How does,
how do you,
uh,
how do you do it?

496
00:29:56.411 --> 00:29:58.690
You say this is what I see in his fights.

497
00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:02.290
And then for Ross gives his input and John gives his input and then Freddie

498
00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:05.980
gives his input.
Yeah.
And you start discussing what's the best way to handle it.

499
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.440
So,
so coming into that fight with Michael Bisping,

500
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:11.630
Michael Bisping was very well prepared.
It was very,

501
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:15.010
very [inaudible] as a very good team with Jason Parillo.

502
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.440
So we were expecting,

503
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:22.740
you always have to gauge also to know you and to know your opponent.

504
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:27.520
You know,
sometime knowing you open it is easier than to knowing yourself,

505
00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:30.400
you know?
So we have to be relaxed,

506
00:30:30.401 --> 00:30:34.450
realistic about your strengths and weaknesses and how you're going to match up.

507
00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.230
I your appointment with Michael Bisping.

508
00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.620
What mess mess me up a little bit is an and all of us is what we're expecting

509
00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:46.810
Michael Bisping to come straight at straight at me,

510
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.260
tried to to take me out right away instead of that,

511
00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.500
it was moving especially more in the second round.

512
00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.170
So the first one was I was doing well,

513
00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.710
but then the second round he started moving away and be more

514
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.710
instead of coming at me.

515
00:31:02.711 --> 00:31:06.790
It was more trying to running our way from me and that's why I love people.

516
00:31:06.791 --> 00:31:08.430
They had said to me as a man that big,

517
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:12.130
because I lost that second round against Michael Bisping and people was like,

518
00:31:12.131 --> 00:31:15.450
man,
what happened to you?
You were you,
you seem like you,
you were,

519
00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:18.730
you slowed down a little bit and it's only that I saw Donna is also at,
yeah,

520
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.740
I got hit with whatever we strong right hand,

521
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:24.610
right on the bottom by a guy who maybe outweigh me,
but 20 pounds,
you know,

522
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:29.680
so it slows them down when something,
not that my cardio was bad,
it's not,

523
00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:32.980
my car was fine,
but did we get punched on the bottom?

524
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:35.560
It's still a man down and he caught me off guard.

525
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.820
He changed his strategy from round one to round two we became more like,

526
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.050
it was more like a runner instead of a hunter kind of guy.

527
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.260
And so he caught you with a counter shot.
What he did is very smart.

528
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:48.910
He couldn't get to me,

529
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.340
if you look at the replay of that fight with Michael Bisping,

530
00:31:51.341 --> 00:31:54.820
he couldn't get to me straight to my head.
Was he trying to hit me with his jab,

531
00:31:54.821 --> 00:31:58.180
with his trike,
tried to target my head,
but I was too fast for him.

532
00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:01.720
So I don't know if it's his trainer or a hymn.
We decide to change.

533
00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:04.300
So he decided to be like,
like a runner.

534
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:08.650
So I decide to try to chase him a little bit more.
And what happened to me,

535
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:14.140
he jab my,
my lead hand,
which square me,

536
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:18.180
and then he connected me straight on the,
on the Chin Wa and that same thing.

537
00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:21.880
I was trying to throw a leg kick so it was a perfect time,

538
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.350
beautiful execution.
And I don't if he practice that,
but it was very well done.

539
00:32:26.351 --> 00:32:30.080
Very smart.
Instead of,
I tried to target my head,
he jab my,
my,

540
00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:33.850
my hand and hit me with the rear hand.

541
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.220
And that's why it hurt me.
It hurt me.

542
00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.260
I tried to put that poker face on and during that five way did it me,

543
00:32:39.261 --> 00:32:40.910
it's one of their strike that hurt me the most.

544
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.730
Even though Michael Bisping is not known as a knockout guy.
This,
this,

545
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.260
this shot really hurt me because of the precision was the timing was good.

546
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:50.780
I've never understood what people don't think he hits hard and we look what he

547
00:32:50.781 --> 00:32:53.390
did to Rockhold.
He hits fucking hard.
It's,

548
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:56.150
I think it's wet hurt someone in a fight.
I mean,

549
00:32:56.151 --> 00:32:59.630
what can put away someone isn't necessarily the power,

550
00:32:59.631 --> 00:33:03.380
but it's more precision and timing.
And that particular,
uh,

551
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.970
Ryan was perfectly time and with great precision.
So that's why I got hurt.

552
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:11.240
And you win their second around,
then add to make adjustment for the third round.

553
00:33:11.241 --> 00:33:15.980
And that's when fair.
Uh,
Freddie Joan and,
and uh,
for the rest come into play.

554
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.830
They were,

555
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:21.810
they saw what it was doing and they say after the Ryan just slip and come with

556
00:33:21.811 --> 00:33:25.730
the hook over the top and the right hand.
And that's what I did.

557
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:30.380
And then the knock him down and,
but in,
in that fight,

558
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:35.730
whatever your trainer tells you,
if you didn't practice it,
it's,

559
00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:40.640
it's not gonna work.
I mean,
you don't have time to think it's autopilot.
Yeah.

560
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.840
So I was on autopilot.
Sometimes you just need some,

561
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.940
some kind of guidance that put you back,

562
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.020
that put your autopilot in the right direction.

563
00:33:50.021 --> 00:33:53.960
And that's what happened into that fight.
A reminder.
Yes.
I little reminder,
Aa,

564
00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.690
we're not going this way.
We're going this way.
Okay.
Then you,

565
00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.850
then it's still there with,
to pilot,
but it's different direction.

566
00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.670
The crazy thing about Mike is,
uh,
he,

567
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:08.750
he has very poor vision in his right eye.

568
00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:13.340
A lot of people might not know about it,
but in the Vito Belfort fight,

569
00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.590
he damaged his retina very badly.

570
00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:20.090
He's had several surgeries and he's got oil in his eye that's sort of like

571
00:34:20.091 --> 00:34:24.350
protecting it and he'll have it fixed once he's done fighting.
But you know,

572
00:34:24.351 --> 00:34:25.041
if you look at him,

573
00:34:25.041 --> 00:34:29.450
one of his eyes is darker than the other eye and that's that right eye.

574
00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:34.100
And did you particularly target things going to that right side,

575
00:34:34.101 --> 00:34:36.020
like things off of your left side?
Yeah,

576
00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:39.320
it's a lot of things that would drill done uh,
with the left hook.

577
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:43.000
That's why like when I,
when I hit him with a left hook that was a lot of,

578
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:47.120
he would have a harder time seeing things coming out of Heelys vision was more

579
00:34:47.121 --> 00:34:48.140
blurry.
He does.

580
00:34:48.141 --> 00:34:52.340
But the thing is with Michael is he adjust himself very well to this,
you know,

581
00:34:52.341 --> 00:34:55.960
like,
like it's like a,
he knows it and probably knows it themselves,

582
00:34:55.961 --> 00:34:58.670
but the way he fights he adjusted very well.
You know,

583
00:34:58.671 --> 00:35:03.440
you put them self in a position that he cannot get hit often with this,
you know,

584
00:35:03.441 --> 00:35:04.540
especially in the,
in my fights.

585
00:35:04.541 --> 00:35:08.540
So I needed almost to wait for him to commit with the right hand to come over

586
00:35:08.541 --> 00:35:09.200
the top.

587
00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:11.900
And you look at that fight with Kevin and guests at them as the same thing he

588
00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:14.260
missed with that right hand.
And then he get counted.

589
00:35:14.261 --> 00:35:18.170
It's always when he missed with the right hand that he got caught carbon fight.

590
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:19.370
I think it was a mistake.

591
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.030
It wasn't a mistake because he was not preparer for this.
He didn't.
Right.

592
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:26.640
What's also,
he just got off of a crazy fight with you.
It was bad.

593
00:35:26.660 --> 00:35:30.710
I think it was a bad mistake.
Farm.
I sparred but,
but look,
to his credit,

594
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:35.260
he tried to do something and that I do try to do all the time.

595
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:40.310
You tried to do something unique and very special and if you would have,

596
00:35:40.441 --> 00:35:44.610
when we would not have this discussion we would have,
would be saying like,
man,

597
00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:48.180
why did I come back?
It's unbelievable.
He lose a title,

598
00:35:48.181 --> 00:35:51.630
come back straight to FICA,
Galvin gasoline and what's amazing.

599
00:35:51.631 --> 00:35:52.530
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

600
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.660
You took a risk man and I can't blame him for it.

601
00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:59.580
I took a risk myself too.
It's just sometimes you roll the dice,

602
00:35:59.581 --> 00:36:03.830
you know when you expect things to go your way and it didn't go his way.
Yeah,

603
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:08.550
I felt bad,
but it is what it even,
he said that when he came out to that fight,

604
00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:09.630
the Kelvin on fight,

605
00:36:09.631 --> 00:36:12.510
he just didn't feel like he ha he just didn't feel there off.

606
00:36:12.511 --> 00:36:15.930
Of course it didn't feel there because he didn't have the time to prepare for

607
00:36:15.931 --> 00:36:17.970
this.
Like I said,
but you're not,

608
00:36:17.971 --> 00:36:21.090
you're not going to go into a fight then and improvise everything.

609
00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.420
You're going to do the same thing you've been doing in training.

610
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.930
What have you been doing in training?

611
00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.470
He didn't have enough time to prepare for that particular type of buddy.

612
00:36:28.471 --> 00:36:32.130
That particular type of of uh,
like I said,
physical,

613
00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:36.420
technical and tactical,
which is that most important one.

614
00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:41.430
You didn't have the tech that the tactical preparation physical was not prep,

615
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:46.950
prep,
prep and be 100% as well.
And the technical is there because this is brain,

616
00:36:46.951 --> 00:36:49.310
but you know,
it's,

617
00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:54.180
he didn't program is autopilot to react to a certain situation that Kevin will

618
00:36:54.181 --> 00:36:58.980
give him.
It was,
he's a lefty,
shorter stockier,
you know,
different style than me.

619
00:36:58.981 --> 00:37:02.480
Completely different.
It's like you couldn't have a difference.
A moat.
Amal.

620
00:37:02.481 --> 00:37:05.550
Amal was different style than me and then this guy,

621
00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.510
but he won the title that way.
One of the title on 11 days notice.
I agree.

622
00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:14.290
It's like it worked for him in the past.
It went for,

623
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.450
it worked for him in that past.

624
00:37:15.451 --> 00:37:20.451
But you didn't get knocked down or choked out before if I Ratko that messed up

625
00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:24.840
your recuperation too.
You know what I mean?
He was fresh,
proud be,
I don't know.

626
00:37:24.841 --> 00:37:28.840
Maybe he wasn't.
I don't,
I don't know personally where what he was doing,
but,

627
00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.243
or was it,

628
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:35.820
he was not like maybe not even a month or something like that.

629
00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:39.180
You wouldn't not have been clear to fight if it would have been in America.

630
00:37:39.181 --> 00:37:41.160
I don't think it would have been cleared to site.

631
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.880
I think it would not have been clear to fighting.
It was suspended,
I think.

632
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.470
I don't think so because they don't think so.
I think they,
because it wasn't,

633
00:37:49.471 --> 00:37:54.300
China is the maybe the three weeks.
Wow.
Three weeks.
Yeah,

634
00:37:54.301 --> 00:37:57.360
man.
Yeah.
That seems pretty close.
Yeah.
Yeah.

635
00:37:57.361 --> 00:38:00.330
Because you heard him with that left hook and then you choke them unconscious.

636
00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.760
If it would be me,
me,
like maybe I don't,

637
00:38:02.761 --> 00:38:05.700
I'm not as courageous as Michael Bisping.
I wouldn't have not take the fight.

638
00:38:05.701 --> 00:38:07.740
Even me,
if I win the fight with Michael Bisping,

639
00:38:07.741 --> 00:38:10.230
I wouldn't not take that fight the word though.
Courageous.

640
00:38:10.231 --> 00:38:14.360
You're pretty courageous guy.
Is that grace or is it tactical?
Tactical.
I moved.

641
00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.990
Not,
I would not have to take that risk,
that risk,
but it's,

642
00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:19.330
I'm not in this shoe was,
I don't know.
Right,
right,
right.

643
00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:23.430
These environment maybe would have,
the toughness is paid off for him though.

644
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:27.330
I mean,
he's one of the toughest fucking guys in the sport.
He always has been.

645
00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.570
And that toughness is the reason why I was like,
fuck it,
I'll fight again.

646
00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.990
That's do it.
He's just a fucking animal.
He is.

647
00:38:33.991 --> 00:38:38.991
And he's a great example of hard work and perseverance and,

648
00:38:40.481 --> 00:38:41.350
and,
and you know,

649
00:38:41.351 --> 00:38:46.351
like when you say everything is possible is it is unbelievable,

650
00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:51.670
unbelievable fighter.
This guy,
you know,
and as courageous and,

651
00:38:51.671 --> 00:38:56.500
and what I like about him do we stand for the same thing then I stand for,

652
00:38:56.501 --> 00:39:00.520
for against performance enhancing drug and I think is very important for me.

653
00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.080
And for me it was like an honor to fighting him.
It was like a,

654
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.680
a lot of guy he lost to this guy that they would that have been cut on

655
00:39:08.681 --> 00:39:12.060
performance enhancing drugs and,
and um,
he's very open.

656
00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.980
He talks about it all the time and I think is great.
Great model for this part.

657
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:20.470
Yeah,
I know,
I agree.
I agree.
And a great model for,

658
00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:25.070
it's just an example of how you can achieve great things if you work hard.
Yeah.

659
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:29.500
And that's what he's done is he's one of that guy that like,

660
00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:33.460
I hate him when I wasn't trying again,
but I loved them as well.
And the same,

661
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.560
same time.
I remember at one point,

662
00:39:35.561 --> 00:39:40.561
at one point we were in the conference in Toronto and that is the largest story

663
00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:48.010
I've heard at a conference.
We go back to back kind of the back door of a mall.

664
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:52.840
And,
um,
there's like a,
I don't know if it's a,
it was staged or not.
I,
I mean,

665
00:39:52.841 --> 00:39:55.180
I'm not aware if it was stage,
I wasn't that aware of it.

666
00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.930
So there's a camera around,
like I think he said was TMZ or something.

667
00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:02.500
It was like,
Kimra,
that photo.
So there was kids following us too.

668
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:06.480
They're about to ask us.
The,
asked me to take pictures and then,

669
00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.720
then I say camera coming towards me.
And then that's Michael.
That's after the,

670
00:40:10.721 --> 00:40:13.510
the,
the governance and Michael the system.

671
00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:18.430
He's a bill at you f book,
you're an on me again because then,
and then,

672
00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:23.230
and then I look in his face and I was like,
what as I do it,

673
00:40:23.231 --> 00:40:26.440
I'll put you back.
And then he create,
create gotta have a buzz word that fight.

674
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:30.250
And we started to shout at each other and it kind of almost boosts each other.

675
00:40:30.251 --> 00:40:34.950
And Jerry [inaudible] is leave it fortified boy.

676
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:38.650
So,
but it's,
it's not stage.
It's true.
Now I'm like,
man,

677
00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:41.780
what the hell he was doing there.
But then after I realize it go,

678
00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:45.310
it was on TMZ where I came out right there.
Then they chose,

679
00:40:45.311 --> 00:40:48.940
they came through asking me for another graph.
They can,
they can,

680
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:52.000
they kind of get um,
intimidating.
They were like,

681
00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:56.380
they went back.
Then I turned around,
I was like,
it's okay.

682
00:40:56.381 --> 00:40:58.030
It's Spanish and all you can come in and go.

683
00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:01.300
They get where they went back to their,
if I write I'm like,
Oh God,
what?

684
00:41:01.301 --> 00:41:02.410
It is what it is,
you know?

685
00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:06.250
But that was probably the best promotion of the old fight,

686
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:08.860
like that particular incident,
you know what I mean?

687
00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:13.000
So I hate him and I love him this same way.
Michael is kind of a guidance.

688
00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:14.910
He's,
he's a pro at,

689
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:19.960
at boosting the anticipation for a fight hype.

690
00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:24.480
You want to hate them,
but you kind of love him.
And then the same way for the,

691
00:41:24.481 --> 00:41:28.520
the human being that he is,
you know?
No,
he's great at talking Shit for sure.
A,

692
00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:32.290
that is a big thing these days.
I'm going,
especially after Connor,

693
00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:36.110
Connor Mcgregor has kind of changed the sport and a lot of ways and that,

694
00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:40.310
that shit talking is a,
is a huge factor now.
It is,

695
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:43.280
but sometimes you don't know when is really what it is.
Not because I'm,
I'm not,

696
00:41:43.281 --> 00:41:44.690
it's not part of my personality.

697
00:41:44.691 --> 00:41:49.330
And same thing at the Espn in Boston,
same thing.

698
00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.700
We do an interview,
we go back and forth,
blah,
blah,
blah.
I kind of,
uh,

699
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:55.220
almost insulting each other.
So resource mean

700
00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.860
then at the UFC does everything to separate us for me,
one of each other.

701
00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:02.690
Like I'm like,
I don't know if it's real or not.

702
00:42:02.691 --> 00:42:04.210
I don't even know if he's trying to push me.

703
00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:06.590
I'm going to push him back cause I feel I felt threatening.

704
00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:11.420
So you don't know if it's hype or myself because I'm not an instigator.

705
00:42:11.421 --> 00:42:13.880
I don't like confrontation,
but it is what it is.

706
00:42:13.881 --> 00:42:16.250
So I go to the bathroom in between.

707
00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.310
Who comes next to the bathroom with us?

708
00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:24.420
It's my [inaudible].
We're,
I'm,

709
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:27.080
we're taking a piss now,
next to each other.
We're like this.

710
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:29.420
Then I throw us Michael Microbus,
ally,
Holy Shit.

711
00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:33.350
Then the camera at any telecom earth,
we twoF out.
As I get out there,

712
00:42:33.351 --> 00:42:35.900
never camera goes out.
They look at me,
look at it.

713
00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:40.440
Then he start laughing and then I start laughing.
Then.

714
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:44.870
Then I told him,
I said,
hey,
you get a range rover?
He's like,
yeah,

715
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:48.740
but now he's in the garage.
I'm like,
yeah,
it's a,
you need to get rid of it.

716
00:42:48.741 --> 00:42:52.070
Because after a while it did start breaking down is I?
Yeah,
I know it was.

717
00:42:52.071 --> 00:42:53.720
I came game phase two later.

718
00:42:56.870 --> 00:43:01.340
I didn't want to hate I guy like this.
You know what I mean?
Oh,
that's hilarious.

719
00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:04.070
But I hate him because when we insult each other,

720
00:43:04.071 --> 00:43:07.310
we say real and salt and real things that we think about each other,

721
00:43:07.311 --> 00:43:11.240
but in a way we have the respect.
Yeah.
So it's really,

722
00:43:11.241 --> 00:43:15.680
but so with that relationship that I have with Bisping was very unique.

723
00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.750
I didn't have the same relationship with [inaudible],
for example,
Diaz.

724
00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:22.840
I didn't know if like if I meet him,
even the district too,
there may,

725
00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.510
he hates my guts and I don't know what he's going to write.

726
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:29.360
I don't know if he wanted to fight me or he might not really want to fight you,

727
00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:31.610
but he's not a hype guy.
I think he's,

728
00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.970
I think he takes it personal and I think he,
it's man,

729
00:43:34.971 --> 00:43:39.920
it's a Freakin spart man is more to life than what it is.

730
00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.820
It was I all fighting his might now,
man,
fighting is not my life,
man.

731
00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:48.260
My life is my family.
Man is,
is my friend.
The people I love.

732
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:53.030
This is what I do in my life is not my life.
I need,
the fighting is over,

733
00:43:53.031 --> 00:43:55.850
it's over.
I turn around and do something else.
You know what I mean?

734
00:43:55.851 --> 00:43:59.870
Like is what I do in my life,
some my life.
You know what I mean?

735
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:04.150
At the end of the world,
man,
this is more to life than fighting who.

736
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.670
It's funny hearing that from you because you would,

737
00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:10.910
you would expect to hear that from someone who isn't considered one of the

738
00:44:10.911 --> 00:44:13.560
greatest of all time.
But you're considered one of the greatest of all times.

739
00:44:13.561 --> 00:44:15.140
So it would be very art.

740
00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:19.700
It would be very hard to argue your approach because it's been so successful.

741
00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:23.090
They,
they,
they,
they got it.
That'd be super obsessed.

742
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.890
I'm super obsessed Joe,

743
00:44:24.891 --> 00:44:28.850
but that's why I become crazy day and I stopped for four years and then when I

744
00:44:28.851 --> 00:44:33.830
came back I,
I some of my circuit and the brains then I am,

745
00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:38.730
I started to analyze myself and like,
why am,
why become crazy?
Why did I stop?

746
00:44:38.731 --> 00:44:41.160
Because I'm taking this stuff too seriously,
man.

747
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:44.420
You have to take it for what it is,
you know,
like yeah,

748
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:47.130
it's a world championship fight.
I'm fighting.
I was fighting.

749
00:44:47.131 --> 00:44:49.280
Michael made after four years be boom,

750
00:44:49.281 --> 00:44:54.281
I got the fight are promoted on drama and like John said,

751
00:44:54.631 --> 00:44:55.410
John Dinner,

752
00:44:55.410 --> 00:45:00.410
he says is I fight are not one Andrae Ma r one r on mundane things than we do

753
00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:08.100
every day.
That's how fight are one.
How you program it,
program your,

754
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:13.140
your,
uh,
your cruise,
uh,
your,
your,
your,
your,

755
00:45:13.141 --> 00:45:15.270
your cruise driver.
You're not doing your,
your,
your,

756
00:45:15.271 --> 00:45:18.600
your autopilot to win the fight.
That's how you me,

757
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:22.110
I see it a fight like an autopilot.
You know like so when I fight,

758
00:45:22.111 --> 00:45:25.740
when I prepare myself for a fight,
especially with the tactical part,

759
00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:28.410
I program like a computer out,

760
00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:33.150
I want to react against that specific problem.
I'm going to take care of that,

761
00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:38.190
that specific problem.
The only way to program it is to do repetition,

762
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.610
repetition and repetition and repetition and repetition.

763
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:46.290
It's like you said a one point the Eddie Bravo,
we said like tie,
tie,

764
00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:47.730
tie up your shoes.

765
00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:50.880
Cause we've been doing it so many times you can talk to someone.

766
00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:53.550
The same thing when I get into a fight,

767
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:59.270
I analyze again and I'm fighting and I see what pattern he does the most often.

768
00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:05.250
So I want to program my computer to react to that pattern that would give me the

769
00:46:05.251 --> 00:46:08.730
advantageous to the fight.
I don't know what,
when that pattern,
when I occur,

770
00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:13.350
when I want to program myself that when at Acura I have an answer for it right

771
00:46:13.351 --> 00:46:15.720
away.
I don't have to think about it.
I don't think.

772
00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:18.030
I just react and that's my problem.

773
00:46:18.031 --> 00:46:21.390
When I used to fight and I got a lot of criticize them before I was thinking too

774
00:46:21.391 --> 00:46:24.420
much towards the end of my carer at so much pressure,

775
00:46:24.421 --> 00:46:27.300
I didn't perform as well as I was earlier,

776
00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:30.180
especially my last fight before I stopped for the four years.

777
00:46:30.181 --> 00:46:34.170
I was thinking too much overthinking too,
putting too much pressure.

778
00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:37.350
Like you said,
it's too serious.
You have to take it for what it is.

779
00:46:37.351 --> 00:46:42.090
It's only a fight in a 10 years,
you know it's,
you know,

780
00:46:42.091 --> 00:46:44.880
it's sucks if you lose,
but man,
it is what it is.
You know what I mean?

781
00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:48.390
Don't take it for,
don't make it bigger than what it is.

782
00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:52.230
It's only a fight and sometimes it's something very therapeutic that I like to

783
00:46:52.231 --> 00:46:56.970
do.
Before a fight,
I could drive a car.

784
00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:01.130
Hey,
when I fight in Vegas,
for example,
I drive a car or a New York,
same thing.

785
00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:05.280
I drive a car.
When I used to fight in Vegas bag before my fight,

786
00:47:05.281 --> 00:47:06.990
I used to be very,
very stressed in one.

787
00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:12.220
A very therapeutic things I that I like to do is drive my car around and see

788
00:47:13.021 --> 00:47:15.350
normal people.
Then I go and I,

789
00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:20.650
I explained to you why I drive an icy old lady with our grocery store bag is

790
00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:21.480
that,

791
00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.990
and I'm thinking it's like she doesn't care if I win the fight Saturday or not.

792
00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.890
She's not even going to hear about it.
Then I look,
oh,

793
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:32.660
he's another guy yelling another guy because the whatever problem,
Oh,

794
00:47:32.661 --> 00:47:37.661
this guy is going to the bank to pays his mortgage stuff and they don't care.

795
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:39.700
They don't care.
You know?

796
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:44.050
The effect that I have on the universe is so freaking small.

797
00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:47.530
Nobody cares.
I'm the only one putting the pressure on me.

798
00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:51.430
Nobody gives a damn about it.
So that's why they helped me to perform.

799
00:47:51.431 --> 00:47:55.090
Now that's how some younger Getty,
I say,
oh,
they are nervous.

800
00:47:55.091 --> 00:47:59.110
How do I heard you don't sleep well the night before I said,
yeah,
it's true.

801
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:02.530
I don't see well is how,
what is your trick?
How do you find a way to see?
Well,

802
00:48:02.531 --> 00:48:06.190
it was like,
ah,
I don't really sleep well either.
Nowadays is how I'll do,

803
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:07.540
but how do you feel better about it?

804
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:10.690
Like I just know that I'm not going to sleep well and it's not going to affect

805
00:48:10.691 --> 00:48:13.180
the outcome of the competition is just a normal thing.

806
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:16.270
You learn how to deal with it better.
You're not going to change it.

807
00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:21.700
Just accept it.
Yeah.
Distress is your friend,
man.
That's gonna make you react.

808
00:48:21.701 --> 00:48:25.480
There's going to be on the edge.
Have you ever slept well before a fight?
Never.

809
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:30.310
Never.
Only one time when I fought Matt Serra and I got knocked out

810
00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:37.330
and then after that knocked out,
I got so scared.

811
00:48:37.331 --> 00:48:42.331
I ended up and again is the most humiliating day of my career.

812
00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:46.540
I was so angry.
Like I said,
it was like putting too much on myself.

813
00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:48.920
It start there is,

814
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:53.770
I don't even want to go to to buy eggs at the grocery store because people are

815
00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:58.240
these.
They look,
you get knocked out.
I taught.
Everybody cares about,

816
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:01.390
nobody cares about you.
Nobody cares.

817
00:49:01.391 --> 00:49:04.930
It's only a small percentage of population.

818
00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:09.550
Nobody gives a them.
And even if they do what you make a mistake,

819
00:49:09.551 --> 00:49:11.830
you zig when you should have zagged you to get clips.

820
00:49:11.831 --> 00:49:16.450
So what everybody make mistake,
you have to take fight like it is,

821
00:49:16.451 --> 00:49:19.990
you know it's a sporting event.
That's why I don't take it personally.

822
00:49:19.991 --> 00:49:23.350
Like I want to have the problem with the diaspora at no problem and is that

823
00:49:23.351 --> 00:49:27.400
fight is not personal for me.
You're,
you're in my life now.

824
00:49:27.401 --> 00:49:31.060
You won't be there in 10 years.
Maybe.
Maybe you will,
man,
I,
who knows.

825
00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:36.010
It's only like a chunk of life that we share together and then after he's gone,

826
00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:39.470
no problem with that.
That's definitely a better attitude to look at that.

827
00:49:39.850 --> 00:49:42.580
That's the way it is.
That's all athletes they should think,
you know,

828
00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:47.770
and that's that knowledge that I have is with years of years of competition,

829
00:49:47.771 --> 00:49:51.010
you know,
all the,
the problem I have,
their colitis and all that.

830
00:49:51.011 --> 00:49:55.390
That's because of that,
that,
that bs that I got it like putting too much on me.

831
00:49:55.820 --> 00:50:00.280
It's normal.
And if I fight again,
it will be,
it will go back.
That same pattern.

832
00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:04.000
I will,
I will not be,
I will be very stressed and it's normal to be stressed,

833
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:05.620
but I will accept it.

834
00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:09.610
I accept it better now than I used to do when I was younger.

835
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:11.620
Now after you won the title,

836
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.680
there was thoughts of whether or not you would defend it if you were going to

837
00:50:14.681 --> 00:50:17.590
fight Robert Whittaker,
like what you were going to do,
what,

838
00:50:17.591 --> 00:50:21.280
what caused your decision?
What made you decide to relinquish the belt?

839
00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:24.520
So the reason why I relinquish your belt is ag.

840
00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.010
I went to do some physical tests to see what,
what,

841
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:29.630
what does that problem with my elk condition?

842
00:50:29.631 --> 00:50:33.110
Because during the decap I knew ad problem.
I didn't know what it was.

843
00:50:33.111 --> 00:50:34.070
I knew it was,
you know,

844
00:50:34.071 --> 00:50:37.790
that that tests the blood tests and everything for the cancer.
He came negative.

845
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:43.080
So after I went to do like,
like I say,
a colonoscopy,
it came back that Adva.
Uh,

846
00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.880
no sir.
Inside my stomach that has a doctor,

847
00:50:46.881 --> 00:50:50.450
I say how long it takes to get rid of this is a,
is all your life.

848
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:54.440
But the symptom,
the symptom can go up,
down,
depending every people,

849
00:50:54.441 --> 00:50:56.240
whatever they do differently.

850
00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:00.140
Then I started researching who's the best doctor or I'll can I do this?

851
00:51:00.141 --> 00:51:03.620
And that's when I start reading about like the fast thing and stuff.

852
00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:06.950
And I,
and I then I,
then I tried it,
but

853
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:12.560
I saw that a lot of,
you know,
in that sport of MMA,

854
00:51:12.561 --> 00:51:16.730
a lot of the guys are a starving day.
They don't,
they're not home,
they not rich.

855
00:51:16.731 --> 00:51:20.180
You know,
I'm lucky now I have enough money for the rest of my life.

856
00:51:20.181 --> 00:51:21.980
I don't need to fight anymore.
You know,

857
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:26.570
if I don't do nothing crazy like buying a private airplane and I'm not that kind

858
00:51:26.571 --> 00:51:31.370
of person or falling into drugs and stuff and I,
I think I'm good,
you know,

859
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:35.950
for me,
my family and everything,
I think I'm good.
However,
at,

860
00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:39.410
when I'm looking at the landscape,
I see a lot of guy,
like for example,

861
00:51:39.411 --> 00:51:42.520
Connor Mcgregor,
you hold onto the title two to four,

862
00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:47.230
the attention the sponsors at this and that.
And I love people do that,

863
00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:50.810
that they kind of stole the division.
And I'd say I do my side.
I said,

864
00:51:50.811 --> 00:51:55.040
you know what I stand for,
for the fighters always did.
You know,

865
00:51:55.041 --> 00:51:56.030
and publicly as,

866
00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:00.980
why am I going to keep that title until to see if I feel better or not and

867
00:52:00.981 --> 00:52:05.090
defend it because I don't even know if my leg,
my weight was dropping down.

868
00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:05.900
It's like I,

869
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:10.640
I'm not even a one 85 or a Memoriam one 70 or one 55 hours.

870
00:52:10.641 --> 00:52:15.050
I'm not,
I don't have the size of a one 85 hours.
So I'm like,

871
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.590
I,
I relinquish it right away.
You know,

872
00:52:18.591 --> 00:52:22.160
I don't want to install the division and make people wait because of me.

873
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:26.040
They're the,
well,
don't go around me.
You know what I mean?
So I,

874
00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:27.680
for the respect I did,
I did it,

875
00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:31.550
but I didn't know before the fight I was going to do it is it happened like

876
00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:36.230
[inaudible] like this people,
I was like,
oh yeah.
You know,
not knowing.
No,
I did.

877
00:52:36.231 --> 00:52:38.330
I didn't know he was going,
I didn't know it was going to have a call.

878
00:52:38.331 --> 00:52:41.990
Ideas and all that stuff.
He,
it came up,
I never tried it before.

879
00:52:41.991 --> 00:52:45.140
I didn't know what would be the outcome,
how I would feel.
I never did it.

880
00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:49.130
You know,
it was a test and this I know,
but I didn't know.
You know,

881
00:52:49.131 --> 00:52:53.010
I have a lot of them.
I'm not a perfect man,
and Joe have a lot of,
uh,

882
00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:56.870
negative stuff about me.
But one thing that I'm not is that I'm not a coward.

883
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:59.390
This,
I swear,
if I say I'm going to do something,
I'm going to do,

884
00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:03.980
I'm not a coward,
you know,
and every of my fight,
every of my fight I was,

885
00:53:03.981 --> 00:53:07.880
I'm scared.
I'm scared.
I'm terrified.
But whatever.

886
00:53:07.881 --> 00:53:10.820
I feel I stepped and I,
and I,
uh,

887
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:16.390
I respect my contract and I do it,
you know?
And,
um,
I didn't,

888
00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:20.720
I didn't know the colitis and all that.
It was,
it would be illogical.

889
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:24.200
Right now if we,
if I want to go back when I'm ready to go back one,
eight,
five,

890
00:53:24.201 --> 00:53:27.570
I'm not one 80,
you know?
Right,
right.
It would be a stupid move.

891
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:32.800
And so if you're gonna fight again and it'd be one 70 or one 55.
Yes.

892
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:36.180
What,
where,
where are you leaning?
Are you leaning towards 55 or 70?

893
00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:42.360
I don't know.
I'm Emily.
I'm gonna.
I want to lean.
We're,

894
00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.200
if I want,
you know what?

895
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:50.310
I've climb the Everest many times.
You know,
I've climate.

896
00:53:50.311 --> 00:53:54.420
Once I lose to Matt Hughes,
then I climate too.
I loosed,

897
00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:58.260
I then I,
then I got it,
then I lose to Masada.
I climate again.

898
00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:03.720
I've done it like three time and you're like,
I'm 37 years old.
I just turned 37,

899
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:08.210
few,
two days ago.
I don't have much left.
Right.

900
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:11.080
And for what I have left,
I want to make the,
the,

901
00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:15.000
the big fight that fight that the fan want to see,
they want to enjoy.

902
00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:16.373
Um,

903
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:20.970
I also want personally for me to achieve something that is unique,

904
00:54:20.971 --> 00:54:25.380
that is rare,
that maybe that never been attempted before.
You know,

905
00:54:25.381 --> 00:54:27.030
that would be something that excites me.

906
00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:32.490
And I'm not only driven by money,
you know,
like,
like,
like,

907
00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:37.290
Eh,
it's good to have money.
We like money.
It's,
it drives us all,

908
00:54:37.291 --> 00:54:40.950
including myself,
but it's not the unique thing that drives me.

909
00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.500
It need to be more than money and they need,

910
00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:47.070
need to be some kind of achievement think that comes with it.

911
00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:51.030
That would exciting me.
So what would that be?

912
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:55.910
That would be 155 pound title.
They,
they,
they,
they offer me Nate Diaz note.
Yeah.

913
00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:00.990
And,
and,
and uh,
it was,
uh,
it was a rumor.
They said it was a done deal.

914
00:55:00.991 --> 00:55:03.270
It's not a done deal if not on my part.

915
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:07.080
And I don't think it was on Nate Diaz part as well,
because from what I've heard,

916
00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:11.800
his brother Nick set,
and even Nate says,
that's his big brother,

917
00:55:11.801 --> 00:55:12.271
his fight,

918
00:55:12.271 --> 00:55:17.120
it's not his fight from Nick,
Nate,
Nate Diaz is,

919
00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:20.430
it is I incredible fight are very well rounded.

920
00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:25.650
However,
from,
if you put yourself in my shoes,

921
00:55:25.651 --> 00:55:29.400
there's nothing good that can come out of it except money and money is not the

922
00:55:29.401 --> 00:55:32.410
only thing that really drive me.
If I beat Nick Diaz,

923
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:37.470
Nate Diaz decisively,
some people will say,
ah,

924
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:41.330
most people would say,
oh,
you took an easy fight or whatever.
Like the,
the,

925
00:55:41.331 --> 00:55:45.820
the criticize them,
we'll say to say,
ah,
he,
uh,
he's a bully,
you know,

926
00:55:45.821 --> 00:55:49.380
155 yeah,
he fought that smaller guide that compete at a smaller,

927
00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:53.550
maybe it's not even smarter than me.
Maybe we're about the most fifth one.

928
00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:57.660
A lot of one 55 or the guys are bigger than me right now.
Nate's a big guy.

929
00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:59.540
He's a big guy.
He's about that same size.
I mean,

930
00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:04.310
but because I compete at one 74 most of my carer and you won the title of West,

931
00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.730
it wouldn't make me look bad.

932
00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:09.600
They will make me look like a bully and this is if I win decisively,
if I,

933
00:56:09.601 --> 00:56:14.220
for example,
if I win,
not decisively,
if I wouldn't not get savoir back and forth,

934
00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:17.560
that people was high,
you suck.
You cannot even,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

935
00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:19.440
And if I got beat,
oh my God,
if I get it,

936
00:56:19.441 --> 00:56:23.160
this format I guess is the end of the world is all the work I put in his finish

937
00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:25.720
and I could have a bad day.
Yeah.

938
00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:30.100
Something that I discovered during my career has been the strongest men in the

939
00:56:30.101 --> 00:56:33.490
world as my,
that was my dream when I was young.
That's why I did UFC.

940
00:56:33.491 --> 00:56:35.410
I want it to be the stronger men in the world.

941
00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:39.010
And I realize over there it did not exist.

942
00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:41.830
You cannot be the stronger men and their world.
This is an illusion.

943
00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:45.340
I love the younger guy.
They said,
well,
the bad ass minute now you're not man,

944
00:56:45.341 --> 00:56:48.760
it doesn't exist.
You would be strong.

945
00:56:48.790 --> 00:56:53.170
You would be a better fighter than this guy and that particular day at that

946
00:56:53.171 --> 00:56:57.580
particular location,
at that particular moment,
maybe in an hour,

947
00:56:57.581 --> 00:57:01.360
if the I would occur an hour later or an hour before or maybe in a different

948
00:57:01.361 --> 00:57:05.920
place where they,
the altitude desire or lower or the different scenario,

949
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:09.880
different environment,
you will lose that fight.
It's always that question of uh,

950
00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:14.110
you know what I mean?
So being the stronger man in the world,
it does its style.

951
00:57:14.111 --> 00:57:18.840
Makes fight.
Maybe were tree guys,
I beat you,
you beat him,
he beat me.
Who's us?

952
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:23.430
It was the best guy is no bad guy.
Right.
That's MMA math,
right?
It is.

953
00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:27.580
It is like this.
That's the way to see it.
There is no stronger men in the world.

954
00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.670
You can't,
you'll say,
oh,
I'm the baddest man on the planet because I'm champion.

955
00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:36.370
Like the belting is is an illusion.
The belting belting is assemble,

956
00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:40.120
but it's an illusion.
It doesn't exist.
You're not the stronger men in the world.

957
00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:44.230
I know a lot of people will disagree with me,
but is it is what it is.

958
00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:46.420
That's if you ask most experienced fighter,

959
00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:51.450
most people would think the same way because we realize at one point like when

960
00:57:51.791 --> 00:57:52.181
we're young,

961
00:57:52.181 --> 00:57:57.181
because of our confidence or maybe are the cockiness or confidence after it.

962
00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:02.770
Not that it fades,
but we,
we,
we see,
we have more experience and knowledge.

963
00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:07.540
We rise.
They tell it's all bs.
It's not true.
So the UFC offered you,
Nate Diaz.

964
00:58:07.541 --> 00:58:11.160
Did you consider it at all or was it like I say it,

965
00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:14.530
I consider it however Aa,

966
00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:19.300
I analyze it.
I talk with Ferris,
what my trainer and everybody,

967
00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:22.390
we were all in the same page on death.
They say say Sally,
it's not,

968
00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:25.120
it's not worth it.
But did the UFC announced it?

969
00:58:25.121 --> 00:58:27.940
Did they say that they were working on it?
I think,
I think they announce it.

970
00:58:27.941 --> 00:58:30.790
I'm not sure.
I think they said there was a done deal.
Look,

971
00:58:30.791 --> 00:58:32.290
it's not our first time it happened and,

972
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:36.340
and I'm not the have a business to run their UFC and they're,

973
00:58:36.341 --> 00:58:41.341
their biggest fear is someone take that title and run with it and has been,

974
00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:45.730
I've been doing it two times with Johny Hendricks.

975
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.530
I know with that Michael Bisping like I run,
they say I run.

976
00:58:50.531 --> 00:58:55.270
But as for the reasons,
you know,
there's always a reasons and,

977
00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:58.480
and that's their biggest fear.
Sure.
So that the,

978
00:58:58.481 --> 00:59:01.600
and I understand that they have a business to run.
It's by this,

979
00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.150
it's like WWE when

980
00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.340
g three the giant passed the torch to all Cogan.

981
00:59:09.850 --> 00:59:14.290
He passed that torch because it's for an a business and he agreed to pass the

982
00:59:14.291 --> 00:59:18.450
torch.
Yes,
but the thing in this,
in this,
in this part,
we're nothing.

983
00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:22.700
Wwe is my life on the line here.
Yes.

984
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:27.350
I don't care about the business.
I do.
What is the best for my interest to me?

985
00:59:27.410 --> 00:59:30.650
Sure.
You have to.
I have to.
I have to be selfish and I am selfish.

986
00:59:30.651 --> 00:59:34.370
I say it opened the I am,
I say it to the fan.

987
00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:38.750
I am selfish because it's a,
it's a sport that I can die.

988
00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:42.990
You can die in this sport and this is the truth can get or not maybe not die,

989
00:59:42.991 --> 00:59:44.200
but he could create,

990
00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:48.380
create at your death and the next time to come in the next year,

991
00:59:48.381 --> 00:59:52.130
maybe you get a blow that messed up something in your brain because of a trauma

992
00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:56.830
that create the something else.
So it's a very serious sport man is,

993
00:59:56.850 --> 01:00:00.050
is not like a,
you play hockey,
play baseball,
play football.

994
01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:03.800
You don't play fighting.
So you do it for yourself.

995
01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.780
You do what is best for yourself.

996
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:08.900
The organization will do what is best for the organization.

997
01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:11.010
They're not your friend.
Right?

998
01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.480
So that's why their relationship with Dana and some other guy in UFC,

999
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:16.850
it's a very special relationship.

1000
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:20.360
Maybe one day we'll sit down and we'll talk about the good old day then and have

1001
01:00:20.361 --> 01:00:24.770
a blast.
Have a laugh.
But right now I always am always on the defensive.

1002
01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:29.560
When my phone rang,
I see that now way like God damn.
Then I say it.

1003
01:00:29.561 --> 01:00:31.980
What I should say,
what I should not say then and then,
uh,

1004
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:36.830
and I'm completely honest about it is like some no man,
no,

1005
01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:40.910
just as I,
if you do this because you are needy yet if you do that,

1006
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.030
if you just take any fight that fight in that name.
No,

1007
01:00:44.031 --> 01:00:45.080
I mean it doesn't work like that.

1008
01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:49.910
It's the ascension to be champion is not a straight line is this all is a nap

1009
01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:53.990
stakeholder.
Oh,
then you come back and that is it.
It is what it is.

1010
01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:57.470
It is what it is.
And you need to be surrounded by smart people.

1011
01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:58.880
And if you don't want to have smart people,

1012
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.420
you need to be smart enough to find those people that are competent,

1013
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:04.400
that will help you in particular domain,

1014
01:01:04.401 --> 01:01:09.320
that you are not competent to make the job for you and complete your circle,

1015
01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:12.290
you know?
Yeah.
Dana was saying for a while that you didn't want to fight.

1016
01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:15.160
He was saying George doesn't want to fight.
He Sat,
he said before,

1017
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:18.250
I didn't want to fight before I fought Bisping.
You know,
he said the life.
Why?

1018
01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:19.210
Why do you think you were saying that?

1019
01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:21.800
Do you think he was putting pressure on you psychologically?

1020
01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:25.790
It was fucking with your head.
Yeah.
So,
um,
so my ego would've made me,

1021
01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:31.340
I'll show you that I could fight brewing me.
This guy.
Right.
That's what it is,

1022
01:01:31.341 --> 01:01:34.700
man.
It's I freaking game.
It's all that game.
We say it's not a game.

1023
01:01:34.701 --> 01:01:37.460
It's real out.
It's all a game.
It's all business.
It's all a game.

1024
01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:43.490
I like Dana,
Dana,
man.
This part was nowhere.

1025
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:48.320
That sparked was government.
He didn't go nowhere because of Dana.
We hold Dana,

1026
01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.391
my living,

1027
01:01:50.391 --> 01:01:54.950
I hoe it to Dana white when I do the UFC Wayans when I introduced everybody,

1028
01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.310
I point to him,
I say,
Dana White,
without him,
none of this would be possible.

1029
01:01:58.311 --> 01:02:03.050
And you write a hundred percent a hundred percent ease that best pound for pound

1030
01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:06.130
promoter of all time.
I don't care about dunking.

1031
01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:10.750
Wherever you Dana White,
he's the best.
He's better than all sport included.

1032
01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.020
I never seen anything like this.

1033
01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:17.050
He can sell ice to an Eskimo if you want to ease an incredibly good fun.

1034
01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:21.410
And He's good at messing up with my head too because even though I,

1035
01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:24.230
sometimes my ego was like Nate,

1036
01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:27.060
Nate Diaz it because of their stuff he said to and the way they try,

1037
01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:31.410
I don't know if the UFC tried to make him say stuff because some fighters are

1038
01:02:31.411 --> 01:02:36.411
more like pond on a chest on a check check chess board and others.

1039
01:02:36.690 --> 01:02:40.830
Me,
I'm not,
I don't follow wind.
Everything analyze.
I'm thinking.
I was like,

1040
01:02:40.831 --> 01:02:43.130
why you say it that way?
Okay,
that's big.

1041
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:47.390
So a lot of stuff had been setting my ego somehow.
Like,
man,

1042
01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:51.240
I want to say,
all right,
you think my schedule is too busy,

1043
01:02:51.241 --> 01:02:53.670
I'll take their far east.
No,
I kicked her out.
You know what I mean?

1044
01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:58.260
But I shall not do that.
This as Tupin move.
If I start acting like this,

1045
01:02:58.261 --> 01:03:00.740
I Barone and a lot of guys,

1046
01:03:00.741 --> 01:03:03.870
they don't have that self control and self discipline in them.

1047
01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:09.060
It's all that game,
man.
That's all that game there was a,
it's not,
it's all,

1048
01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:11.610
it's bs.
It's all a game.
Men,
it's all a game.

1049
01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:16.290
What did Nate say that fucked with you?
Okay.
And they'd be eyes and,
and nick.

1050
01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:18.030
Nick is like kind of together.

1051
01:03:18.031 --> 01:03:22.740
And then when they say that I took steelhead when I fought this brother,
uh,
I,

1052
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:26.580
I messed up my glove,
my rap.
Um,

1053
01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:31.540
I didn't make weight.
And uh,
what did you say?
Oh yeah,

1054
01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:33.810
I put something in that in div of his brother.

1055
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.910
So he said if I want to take care of it,
like if,

1056
01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:38.610
I don't know why you said it in his own like word,

1057
01:03:38.611 --> 01:03:43.170
like in English slang like Oh yeah,
if you want to take care of this,
I'm there.

1058
01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:47.160
You know,
all kinds of,
someone poisoned him.
Yes.
Who was was that for?

1059
01:03:47.161 --> 01:03:51.270
Which fight was that?
So at Anderson Silver.
Okay.
I gotta confess the Joe,

1060
01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:55.170
I got to confess,
I got to confess.
Okay.

1061
01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:00.250
I was,
I was so scared during this,
this fight.

1062
01:04:00.251 --> 01:04:04.440
So we tried to poison,
I was so scared of fighting Nick Diaz.

1063
01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:07.950
So we poison is ivy.
What the survived.

1064
01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:11.580
So it was even more terrifying,
you know,
so

1065
01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:15.370
all the athletic commission was on my payroll,

1066
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:18.000
so they trade away and then I made it

1067
01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:22.560
and it went through.
So I was even more than verifier.

1068
01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:26.540
So the Elio and abduct me,
what that guy,

1069
01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:31.410
they put the Gay Gamma Ray do increase my strength.
Like the Oak,

1070
01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:36.600
that guy a performance enhancing drug and ended the fight was still happening.

1071
01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:41.460
So right before I put some glass and cement in my gloves,

1072
01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:46.650
make sure
and still add a crazy hard fight,
you know?

1073
01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:50.190
So I got to confess with Nick Mal,
but it's completely insane.
You know,

1074
01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.193
fight.

1075
01:04:52.330 --> 01:04:56.430
You said all that you said for my fight that I present is ivy,

1076
01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.760
that I was on steroids,
that I,
my,
my,

1077
01:05:00.030 --> 01:05:04.550
my rap was wrong.
And you said also what,
what did he say?

1078
01:05:04.551 --> 01:05:08.460
That he said?
Yeah,
the,
the way and like,
I didn't make weight.

1079
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:13.470
Like I w I tricked the athletic commission or they were on my likes total today.

1080
01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:18.130
Is it just when he is,
I think he's,
he's,
he has a,

1081
01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:22.780
he has a problem of a consideration.
Consideration to eat,
to eat.

1082
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.130
Take everybody's against him,
you know,
paranoia.
Yes.
I think that's what it is.

1083
01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:30.940
That might be the weed.
It could be weed.
You know,

1084
01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:36.110
I don't wanna I don't wanna say nothing.
Vida are weighed that take bubba,

1085
01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:40.300
but we'd like all things can be good,
but also can be Buckeye.
Okay.

1086
01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:43.740
I know you're,
you're afforded a weed stuff.
I've,

1087
01:05:43.741 --> 01:05:45.940
I do enjoy weed and you're a smart guy.

1088
01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:50.941
You'll have much better argument than I in R four four that time we'll use

1089
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:55.570
though of everything,
including drinking.
Right.
I like a drink every now and then.

1090
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:59.020
I like pot.
I don't think you should smoke it all day,

1091
01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.920
but I think that's why it is.
I think we,
I don't if it's a weed,

1092
01:06:02.921 --> 01:06:07.921
but I think it's maybe we'd social environment or and genetic can create some

1093
01:06:08.771 --> 01:06:13.090
kind of disorder disorder in,
in the brain and make you have the inspiration,

1094
01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:17.980
conspiracy problem you think everybody is against you,
isn't good,
good happen.

1095
01:06:17.981 --> 01:06:21.910
And the could happen.
I've seen a lot of my friend,
we smoke a lot.

1096
01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:26.890
They have this problem.
Sometime they think they can't,
they paranoid.
Yeah.

1097
01:06:26.891 --> 01:06:30.690
I think it's like all things you do too much of it.
It can fuck with your head.

1098
01:06:30.740 --> 01:06:33.520
Everything could be good or a bad thing.
Now I'll you use.
Yes.

1099
01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:36.130
So what fight is interesting to you?

1100
01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:41.050
There's this talk of Khabib at one 55 was the champion now and Connor.

1101
01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:45.430
Those are the two fights that I hear right?
Right now.
Right now as we speak now.

1102
01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:50.440
I wouldn't want not won't right now to put myself immediately in a training camp

1103
01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:52.780
because the reason is my symptom is not gone.

1104
01:06:52.781 --> 01:06:55.630
I ate your colitis a fill a little bit.
It's not,

1105
01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:59.980
it's not as bad as it was.
Not even close.
It's much better,

1106
01:06:59.981 --> 01:07:04.720
but I want to get the rear of it before I get into a training camp before I got

1107
01:07:04.721 --> 01:07:09.640
put myself into a stress cause that stress what it does,
it amplify everything.

1108
01:07:09.641 --> 01:07:14.290
So if you have like little issue is that it will amplify it and at least I need

1109
01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:15.500
to take care of that is my,

1110
01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:19.810
my lt is an bus in front of my performance in sport.

1111
01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.980
This is why we're important and when I'm ready like I don't know,
I may,

1112
01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:27.670
I would like go something like I said,
unique,
rare,

1113
01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:29.800
something that is reared that never been done before.

1114
01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:34.780
That would be a 55 con champion should be 55 which is the the first and Emma in

1115
01:07:34.781 --> 01:07:37.030
MMA to have the three title never been done before.

1116
01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:41.260
Or it could be maybe by that time it would be another guy maybe,
I don't know.

1117
01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:47.230
It would be someone will come back and do something great that w will be the man

1118
01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:48.840
to beat.
You know what I mean?
Right.

1119
01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:53.270
We talk about the Diaz brother and Alzheimer's.
I change,

1120
01:07:53.271 --> 01:07:57.190
shoved it subject a little bit,
but we on the same way,

1121
01:07:58.540 --> 01:08:03.540
it's sad for four and Nick Diaz that he doesn't fight because stylistically

1122
01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:05.710
people might think I'm crazy,

1123
01:08:05.711 --> 01:08:10.270
but stylistically I think he can beat Tyron Woodley.
I think he can.

1124
01:08:10.810 --> 01:08:13.390
He's that kind of guy.
I keep coming at to keep coming at you.

1125
01:08:13.391 --> 01:08:16.760
And Tay is good at taking shots that keep coming,
keep coming at you.

1126
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:18.470
And I remember when I fought him.

1127
01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:24.260
It's terrifying because you got tired and this guy keeps coming at you and make

1128
01:08:24.261 --> 01:08:26.420
you feel like you claustrophobic and you,

1129
01:08:26.750 --> 01:08:30.290
you do things at him and he keep coming in and he's very nature and they're laid

1130
01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:35.150
around like after like three,
four rounds.
Fuck man is like,
it's very,

1131
01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:39.050
he never gets tired.
It doesn't get terrible.
[inaudible] it makes you,

1132
01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.310
it's exhausting.

1133
01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:45.920
So nervous on the nervous system and the mental system,

1134
01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:48.940
not only physically solo numb,
not much physically it's,

1135
01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:52.990
it's on the nervous system.
He'd come at you and you fake.
And then,
uh,
and,

1136
01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:57.870
and there was like a reaction time and recent time when you fight in all like,

1137
01:08:57.910 --> 01:09:02.910
like I studied this with my thing when I was fighting guys and Nate Diaz,

1138
01:09:03.501 --> 01:09:07.760
he make people tired.
He make the nick,
nick,
Nick.

1139
01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:10.820
That's why he wins fight.
He's kind of a slow Gabe up,

1140
01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:15.440
but people get more tired than him quickly,
especially in their nervous system.

1141
01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.680
There was a guy like Bj Penn for example,
when I fought Bj Penn,

1142
01:09:18.681 --> 01:09:23.030
I knew that Bj Penn at the best reaction time of all fire we have seen in UFC

1143
01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:25.580
when he was at his best.
I measure the guy,

1144
01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:29.450
we know what I mean for rest of merger with with the frame,
you know a frame,

1145
01:09:29.451 --> 01:09:31.940
like a picture.
When you throw a bunch of big click,
click,
click,

1146
01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:36.560
Bj Penn at the best reaction time of all fighters be Bj Penn when he was in his

1147
01:09:36.561 --> 01:09:41.210
best.
When I fought him,
I knew if I go straight at him,

1148
01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.880
you have a better reaction time that then than me.

1149
01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:47.750
So my goal is he had a very good reaction time,

1150
01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:51.330
but a bad reset time.
So it was recent time is,
is,
is kind of a,

1151
01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:54.930
the endurance for the brain so he could react like a smell.

1152
01:09:54.931 --> 01:09:57.680
You could react very fast.
But after a while he got tired very,

1153
01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:01.970
very fast after a lot of faking it and then this,
I make him guests and stuff.

1154
01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.190
So it was getting very tired fast.

1155
01:10:04.191 --> 01:10:08.380
So because of that I could get him because of that equity.

1156
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:13.390
I could fake it and make him tired and lower his reaction time and then get him

1157
01:10:13.461 --> 01:10:18.020
later.
Yeah.
So Nate Diaz us.
Why he's so good.
And they,
nick,
Nick's Yas.
Sorry.

1158
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:21.570
That's what he's so good.
And then that sad for him and he can't,

1159
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:25.830
he doesn't fight is fast.
Are his best years are now.
We should do now.

1160
01:10:25.831 --> 01:10:29.870
And that's why you should do man.
He needs only 33 is that what we said?

1161
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:33.920
33 or 34 I mean he's in his Yay.
Should do it now.
He should do it.

1162
01:10:33.921 --> 01:10:37.220
The man he had done a port city make a lot money.
He could,
he could do it could,

1163
01:10:37.221 --> 01:10:37.851
you could do it.

1164
01:10:37.851 --> 01:10:42.050
They suspended him for pot after he fought Anderson Silva and then he had to pay

1165
01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.700
a fine.
They never paid the father because he's,
he's Nick Diaz is it now?

1166
01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:50.630
But I respect that because in his mind need,
think is wrong and he don't,

1167
01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:54.710
he has a line.
You have a code,
you know and the same thing.

1168
01:10:54.711 --> 01:10:57.350
I have the code for me for the drug test policy.

1169
01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:59.120
I didn't want to come back unless they do some,

1170
01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:01.910
I say it to Lorenzo and Dana after my fight,

1171
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:07.580
my last fight I say it is that I my code and I it they wouldn't have done it.

1172
01:11:07.581 --> 01:11:10.400
I would not have come back.
I have never Hendricks was on something.

1173
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:14.250
This is is that,
there's that question.

1174
01:11:14.850 --> 01:11:17.730
I don't have the evidence and we'll never have it.

1175
01:11:17.731 --> 01:11:22.130
Like you don't have the evidence and I we talk about fighters like I like that

1176
01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:25.620
got cut.
You don't have the evidence they were there before it got cut.

1177
01:11:25.621 --> 01:11:27.150
Like I not to have the evidence.

1178
01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.730
The only thing I can say is I didn't want to attack one particular individual

1179
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:37.470
and I wanted to change the system because if you have one individual,

1180
01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:38.490
another one would come.

1181
01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:43.380
So in that particular case it was Hendrix and I want it to change it.

1182
01:11:43.410 --> 01:11:46.290
And in the beginning he agreed with me to do it,

1183
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:50.330
but then he changed his mind and that's when I got very angry.

1184
01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:54.480
Agreed with you to take me.
I agreed.
I agreed that it was public.
He agreed.

1185
01:11:54.481 --> 01:11:56.550
When we say you can look,

1186
01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:01.380
you have the evidence that in the interview he said he agreed to do a test but

1187
01:12:01.381 --> 01:12:03.840
then he said,
ah no,
I did not agree.

1188
01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:08.840
Because also the UFC told him to not agri that UFC told him the UFC told him is

1189
01:12:10.171 --> 01:12:15.120
the truth.
They told him to not do it because they weren't,
they didn't want,

1190
01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:19.090
they had a problem maybe with the um,
the VAD Duh,

1191
01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:24.290
the Wa that Aveda world anti-doping that there is a wider that make the

1192
01:12:25.421 --> 01:12:28.150
guideline but there vadder that's Vander that I took.

1193
01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:30.160
They had a problem with them.
I don't know why.

1194
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Did he know he was Marimekko rep read something or it was a lady but they had a

1195
01:12:36.211 --> 01:12:40.950
problem so they said to not do with the test may not do it,

1196
01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.570
period.
I don't know if it was big.

1197
01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:46.140
I think it was because of weather because I made that little investigation on

1198
01:12:46.141 --> 01:12:47.760
that and I got very angry.

1199
01:12:47.761 --> 01:12:52.470
That's why like sickle logically I said to myself,
I shouldn't,
I should not have.

1200
01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.740
If I would have go back in time and I would not have that,

1201
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:56.940
that fight I'm going to have to take,
that's fine.

1202
01:12:57.330 --> 01:12:59.580
That's why I respect a lot of fight or they stand up for themselves.

1203
01:12:59.610 --> 01:13:03.750
I didn't have the courage that I didn't do it when it was time to do it and I

1204
01:13:03.751 --> 01:13:06.580
should,
that I regret it about this one thing.
I regretted my career.

1205
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.140
I should have done it as I don't want to sign.
Okay,
take your belt.
I'm going,

1206
01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:13.830
I should have done that before.
Maybe I would have come back earlier

1207
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:20.130
so I would miss a paycheck,
but wouldn't who you know and I enough,

1208
01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.750
I would have enough.
You know what I mean?

1209
01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:24.660
So you don't want to say whether or not you suspect that Johnny Hendricks is

1210
01:13:24.661 --> 01:13:29.490
doing something,
but there was people that were definitely doing something.
Yes.

1211
01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:34.260
I don't have the evidence.
Maybe you did.
Maybe you don't want to accuse.

1212
01:13:34.290 --> 01:13:37.470
And I a lot of guide,
they do it and I don't,

1213
01:13:37.710 --> 01:13:41.640
I don't want to judge them because I love that they have a family to feed and

1214
01:13:41.641 --> 01:13:46.641
everything and this could make the difference between winning $1 million or not

1215
01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:51.600
winning and like,
Eh,
at all.
You know what I mean?

1216
01:13:51.930 --> 01:13:56.330
So everybody has a different reason why are they the,

1217
01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:57.210
they do it and I,

1218
01:13:57.211 --> 01:14:02.211
and it's just a system and courageous it to do with it has that problem.

1219
01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.730
Yeah.
And especially if there's no testing or the testing is very poor,

1220
01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:09.090
like the testing when you first started your career,

1221
01:14:09.290 --> 01:14:13.090
I mean basically just had to pee after the weigh in and you were okay.

1222
01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:18.160
You have to be,
even now,
it's still easy to,
to even now it's even so,
yeah,

1223
01:14:18.161 --> 01:14:22.150
man,
it is like how would someone rig,
okay,
let's say you have a,

1224
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:25.690
we're about on my phone.
Okay.
You know,
I'm saying it then everybody knows that.

1225
01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:28.780
Especially that she thought,
I didn't know that look after I thought it true.

1226
01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:32.980
It's not 100% sure,
but let's say I want to have a,

1227
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
an injection of a product that will last and my buddy for two days or one day.

1228
01:14:40.210 --> 01:14:44.620
So I know that particular day I cannot be tested because if I am,
I'm screwed.

1229
01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.210
Right?
So I put in a,

1230
01:14:46.211 --> 01:14:51.211
I put my tea and my worry about that I'm traveling to the Freakin Antarctica,

1231
01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:56.050
Antarctica or anywhere like somewhere that is crazy believable.

1232
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:59.020
And then I come back and do two days after.

1233
01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:04.330
But that's obsessed with sin,
my buddy for a certain period of time.
But it will,

1234
01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.510
they effect of it will last maybe a month.

1235
01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:10.570
And now we talk about performance enhancing drugs.

1236
01:15:10.571 --> 01:15:12.400
Joe People don't misunderstand.
Is there all,
yeah,

1237
01:15:12.401 --> 01:15:15.250
but it still doesn't make different.
Yes,
it does make the difference.

1238
01:15:15.251 --> 01:15:20.251
And then athlete and the reason is in the 80s and before it w it was giving you

1239
01:15:21.131 --> 01:15:24.940
more power,
more stem in a Morin Germans now a man with the technology,

1240
01:15:24.941 --> 01:15:28.450
they have stuff that will change your reaction time,
your confidence,

1241
01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.840
your reset time and not,
this is a huge,

1242
01:15:31.841 --> 01:15:36.510
huge application man.
If you're,
if you're play baseball or union in finding,

1243
01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:39.010
you see the things coming,
you have your reaction time,

1244
01:15:39.011 --> 01:15:42.640
your sharper in dead brain.
What makes a guy athletic?

1245
01:15:42.850 --> 01:15:46.680
It's not as muscle.
The reason why you saying both is you run faster.

1246
01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:50.050
There's many reasons why.
But one of the main reason is because his brain,

1247
01:15:50.051 --> 01:15:52.360
his nervous system is better.

1248
01:15:53.110 --> 01:15:56.860
And if you make your nervous system better and more,
more competent,

1249
01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.650
a better,
you're a better athlete,
man,

1250
01:15:59.651 --> 01:16:01.840
you better fight or you better baseball player,
you better,

1251
01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:04.660
you better person a better person in a way.

1252
01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:09.740
Of course that effect is limited,
but there's still the,

1253
01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:14.810
the muscle memory thing that will last,

1254
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:16.420
you know,
and he could laugh forever.

1255
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:19.480
So now where that technology man at one point that sport,

1256
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:24.370
that's why I'm afraid I'm afraid to sport becomes so messed up that with the

1257
01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:25.630
gene doping and all that,

1258
01:16:25.631 --> 01:16:29.710
I want point it would be off sport would be completely,

1259
01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:34.210
completely messed up in the future.
I talk not now,
but sport will be,

1260
01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:39.490
it won't be any normal people competing would be all like kind of a Seaborg

1261
01:16:39.491 --> 01:16:41.200
people cyborgs ever.

1262
01:16:41.201 --> 01:16:44.080
But people are really worried about gene doping and the [inaudible] are already

1263
01:16:44.081 --> 01:16:47.290
starting to do that.
But not any gene.
Even the mother,
the mother and stuff,

1264
01:16:47.291 --> 01:16:50.770
performance enhancing drug de Doo,
man.
It's very hard to catch up people.

1265
01:16:50.771 --> 01:16:54.250
So like I said,
it's easy to take something.
I mean,

1266
01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:58.090
there's always that chance that you get cut,
but that's how I,
if I would do it,

1267
01:16:58.091 --> 01:17:00.220
that's how I would do.
I would break down,

1268
01:17:00.221 --> 01:17:04.840
I'm going to Nark Antartica get an injection,
then I come back and I'm,
I'm good.

1269
01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:07.510
No.
Wicki told me that there are starting,
will they,

1270
01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:10.310
they have it and they don't

1271
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:12.410
<v 1>know whether or not people are taking it,
but they're taking,</v>

1272
01:17:12.411 --> 01:17:16.700
testosterone's is derived from animals,
not from wild yams,

1273
01:17:16.910 --> 01:17:20.810
like the way they get testosterone now if you get like a testosterone injection,

1274
01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:25.370
they're getting it from a wild yams and some yams.
Yeah.

1275
01:17:25.371 --> 01:17:28.550
The fruit of the,
the,
you know,
the vegetable,
the tube or you know,

1276
01:17:28.551 --> 01:17:32.060
it's like in Jamaica is they,
they,
yeah.
Yeah.

1277
01:17:32.061 --> 01:17:35.270
That's how they're getting testosterone.
They're getting it from that

1278
01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:41.820
plant based,
um,
wild Yam testosterone.
But now,
uh,

1279
01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:46.990
they're able to get it from animals and the animal testosterone,
you,

1280
01:17:46.991 --> 01:17:47.840
you don't like,

1281
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:52.870
they do carbon isotope tests and the carbon isotope test don't detect the

1282
01:17:53.241 --> 01:17:57.380
difference between a animal testosterone and human testosterone,

1283
01:17:57.710 --> 01:17:58.910
but there's a current tests.

1284
01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:02.360
One of the things that they do is they freeze your piss and they freeze your

1285
01:18:02.361 --> 01:18:04.880
blood for,
I think they're doing it for years,

1286
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:09.170
and this is how they've caught some of these Russian wrestlers and they've taken

1287
01:18:09.171 --> 01:18:13.240
away gold medals from guys at one in the early two thousands for a,

1288
01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:16.190
they've found new tests,
and with the new test,

1289
01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.450
they'd be able to determine that they were taking several days.

1290
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:23.140
That same thing when Ben Johnson beat Carl Lewis.
Yes.
Yeah,
yeah.

1291
01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:26.510
And Ben Johnson this,
well,
he was on some shit,
but guess what,

1292
01:18:26.511 --> 01:18:28.610
Carl [inaudible] some shit.
Yeah.

1293
01:18:28.611 --> 01:18:31.960
Then I think nine out of 10 or eight out of that,

1294
01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:36.320
like the guy that that finished like eight,
like it was a Brazilian guy.

1295
01:18:36.321 --> 01:18:38.570
He would eat it.
Any enter,
you got interviews?
I'd,
yeah,

1296
01:18:38.571 --> 01:18:41.360
it was just aligned fillers for the main guy.

1297
01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:44.780
He would have won the gold medal.
Right.
Because the man,

1298
01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:47.010
that shit changed your life,
man,

1299
01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.180
that changed your life may make you a better living.

1300
01:18:50.181 --> 01:18:54.780
Million naira may be sponsorship that just so bad,
you know.
I see.

1301
01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:57.290
Yeah man,
this is crazy.
How about Lance Armstrong?

1302
01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:00.080
I mean when you go the Tour de France,

1303
01:19:00.081 --> 01:19:02.810
when he won and then they took his title away,

1304
01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:05.600
all the people that were below him,
we're also guilty.

1305
01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:09.590
So you'd take his title away.
What about the number two?
He's fucking guilty too.

1306
01:19:09.591 --> 01:19:12.680
Number three,
they said that on one of the years that he won,

1307
01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:17.210
you had to go back to 18th place to find a guy who's never caught taken anything

1308
01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:23.480
that's a dirty sport.
But man,
you asked me if I think he was taking,

1309
01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:28.460
I don't know.
I haven't asked suspicions have a suspicion,
but it's not right.

1310
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:31.130
If you know what that would the evidence because Iq,
someone,
yes,

1311
01:19:31.190 --> 01:19:35.720
I agree with and even today it's,
if,
I think there was some guys,

1312
01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:40.720
there is a lot of guy that takes the red and performance enhancing drug.
Yes,
yes.

1313
01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:45.820
And I have an idea of who and I'm pretty like just for my gut feeling,

1314
01:19:46.730 --> 01:19:50.900
99.9% sure,
but I don't want to have the abundance.

1315
01:19:50.901 --> 01:19:55.170
It's not what you think.
Some way you know is what you can prove.
And I,

1316
01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:58.730
I don't know,
you know,
talking to,
you know,
I'm in that game,

1317
01:19:58.731 --> 01:20:02.120
I'm talking to a lot of people in between fighters.
We know who does,
who.

1318
01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:05.750
There's only a few and full of people with does the old,

1319
01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:07.860
the whole team.

1320
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:11.340
<v 0>Yeah they don't,
one guy could do these steam,
the steam,</v>

1321
01:20:11.341 --> 01:20:13.860
these theme and one other guy can do two team.

1322
01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:17.260
The word guy that goes around them,
especially when you're,

1323
01:20:17.330 --> 01:20:20.970
you're top elite fighter got world goes I,
the word goes around,

1324
01:20:20.971 --> 01:20:24.940
you know like lady people,
they,
they talk to me and they say if I,

1325
01:20:24.941 --> 01:20:25.970
if I would be interested,

1326
01:20:25.971 --> 01:20:28.770
I'd been off different offered before in different things,
you know,

1327
01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:29.910
what have you been offered before?

1328
01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:34.710
I've been offered men too sometime to go train and then like some deals,

1329
01:20:34.711 --> 01:20:39.240
you know like good go train and do,
do,
do something.
Being being part of a,

1330
01:20:39.241 --> 01:20:41.880
you know,
like they have a,
they take sample of your blood,

1331
01:20:41.881 --> 01:20:44.910
they know what is missing.
Then they put the stuff that is missing.

1332
01:20:44.911 --> 01:20:48.090
Make Cube as I know as I rather stay in Montreal,
you know,

1333
01:20:48.091 --> 01:20:51.110
like I like I and I don't say much Montrell could I,

1334
01:20:51.111 --> 01:20:54.840
it could be a lot of cheater too,
right?
Like I that's the thing.

1335
01:20:54.841 --> 01:20:56.580
You accuse a gym of cheating.

1336
01:20:56.581 --> 01:20:59.910
You can actually was a gym of cheating because everybody is different.
You know,

1337
01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:03.570
there's people cheating everywhere now you can't say,
oh this,

1338
01:21:03.571 --> 01:21:06.870
these people are cheap now man,
they just doesn't work like that.
It works.

1339
01:21:06.871 --> 01:21:11.310
Every individual,
you know,
if you made the choice,
if you decide to go that path,

1340
01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:13.740
you have to be ready to face the consequences.

1341
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:16.180
If you don't face a consequence Zirena your,

1342
01:21:16.190 --> 01:21:21.190
your competition years and maybe you'll face later after you're gone and you

1343
01:21:21.361 --> 01:21:25.170
retire for your carrier.
As I,
a lot of a lot of people I know is creating a lot.

1344
01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:28.380
Some of my friend,
they were bodybuilders now the seed seed there,

1345
01:21:28.381 --> 01:21:33.200
buddy are mess up man.
There are moans all messed up date.
They,

1346
01:21:33.230 --> 01:21:36.690
they,
they got bad problem.
I don't want to be like that,
you know?

1347
01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:40.650
I don't want to be like that.
I want to be happy,
you know?
I want to be healthy.

1348
01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:44.430
Yeah.
They tear the joint apart too.
That's like,
uh,
I had um,

1349
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:46.590
Dorian Yates on the podcast.

1350
01:21:46.591 --> 01:21:50.400
He can't even do pushups now and Dorian Yates was Mister Olympia.

1351
01:21:50.401 --> 01:21:54.810
It was a fucking giant guy.
But all that,
everything just ripped apart.

1352
01:21:54.811 --> 01:21:59.400
It's like everything's all fucked up.
It just doesn't work right anymore.
However,

1353
01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.370
if you ask these people,
would you do it again?
Maybe they say,
yeah,

1354
01:22:02.371 --> 01:22:05.790
maybe it was worth it.
Maybe it was worth it.
Maybe it wasn't.

1355
01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:09.270
I think it depends on every individual.
You know what I mean?
But for me,

1356
01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:14.100
I'm happy with what I have so far.
I know I could get more,
maybe the future,

1357
01:22:14.101 --> 01:22:18.820
but I don't want to do to go that path to try to risk everything or what do you

1358
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:21.930
want to think when testosterone replacement therapy was a thing and they were

1359
01:22:21.931 --> 01:22:25.470
allowing people like ve tour and these people who take testosterone,

1360
01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:29.430
how as so freaking angry about this?
I think it was like,
you know,

1361
01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:35.130
I everybody,
it's a different case for everybody,
but I believe if you,

1362
01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:40.160
if you need to take the medication to compete performance and medication to

1363
01:22:41.701 --> 01:22:45.150
compete,
you shouldn't be allowed.
Shouldn't be.
And,
and,
and Joe,

1364
01:22:45.151 --> 01:22:48.240
I'm not against steroids.
I'm going to explain it to like,
people say,
oh he's,

1365
01:22:48.241 --> 01:22:52.960
I guess I'm not against Purr like stay steroid or Tessa.

1366
01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:56.220
I'm not against it.
If it's for their wellbeing,

1367
01:22:56.670 --> 01:23:01.360
if it's an older man who we cannot have sex with his wife and he is like,
man,

1368
01:23:01.361 --> 01:23:04.740
that he goes to the doctor,
it's like,
man,
I,
I lose the edge at it a bit.

1369
01:23:04.741 --> 01:23:08.090
Can director was a yeah,
I put the cream that that will increase it.

1370
01:23:08.091 --> 01:23:11.260
That sounds so you and the guy is happier.
You have sex with his wife?

1371
01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:15.070
Competition?
Yes.
In terms of competition,
if me and you were fighting and I,

1372
01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:20.130
we sign that we're not using any weapon and I'm talking about biological weapon

1373
01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:25.800
and we'll fight men to men as real martial artists by a card of a code of honor

1374
01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:27.790
and you'll behind or me,

1375
01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:32.530
I go and inject myself something to make me stronger or more competent.

1376
01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:36.970
Might my could also help my neurone deferred to fire.

1377
01:23:36.971 --> 01:23:40.840
Better to get something to be more,
to be better,

1378
01:23:40.841 --> 01:23:44.260
to enhance my performance.
Now,
now I'm against that.

1379
01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:47.980
This is a code of honor and the the,
if you don't respect that code man,

1380
01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:49.960
it should be out of martial arts.

1381
01:23:49.990 --> 01:23:53.220
What are people taking that makes the reaction time better?
It makes her mind,

1382
01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:56.660
I don't know that that name,
but there there is many.
If you talk to a guy,

1383
01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:59.560
there's a lot of things,
a lot of things I know baseball player,

1384
01:23:59.561 --> 01:24:01.750
they take stuff for the reaction time,

1385
01:24:02.050 --> 01:24:07.050
like the picture because in baseball and tennis and even in fighting before you

1386
01:24:07.171 --> 01:24:10.150
throw a punch,
there is an indication you're,
but the body language,

1387
01:24:10.151 --> 01:24:12.190
he reads something like before you throw a ball,

1388
01:24:12.191 --> 01:24:16.750
there's a movement for you punched her as well.
So you see better you,
you brain,

1389
01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:20.860
there's even a medication you can take for exam.
You study in school,

1390
01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.720
there is an exam to you have an exam.

1391
01:24:22.721 --> 01:24:26.430
Tomorrow you're going to study or your your desk stuff that you need to know.

1392
01:24:26.450 --> 01:24:29.350
Then and night he will increase you.
Then you go pass the exam.

1393
01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.040
I know it some crazy go,
go,
go get it.
And it's crazy man.
Well,
I know Adderall,

1394
01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:37.660
Adderall Swan.
It makes you a man.
He make you better,
better in the brain.

1395
01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:40.510
If you make your brain better,
your nervous system better,
man.

1396
01:24:40.511 --> 01:24:44.470
You bet you you're a better fighter.
Yeah.
It's not only the physic,
physical,

1397
01:24:44.810 --> 01:24:49.150
[inaudible] uh,
enhancement.
It wasn't the 80s.

1398
01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:52.600
Now winning the 2000 year now.
Now it's neurologic man.

1399
01:24:52.630 --> 01:24:55.440
That's when it's crazy dangerous and so new.

1400
01:24:55.450 --> 01:24:58.540
It will be like it would the gene doping.
Forget it man.

1401
01:24:58.541 --> 01:25:00.940
The athlete will be born athlete.
You want me?

1402
01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:05.080
I got like me or anybody that fight in UFC won't be able to compete and you have

1403
01:25:05.081 --> 01:25:09.210
seen it anymore because they are not super humane human.
You know what I mean?
No,

1404
01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:12.700
I agree.
The future sport will be so messed up.
It will be crazy.

1405
01:25:12.850 --> 01:25:16.870
We're all going to be gamers.
Play video game.
Yeah,
right.
Yeah.

1406
01:25:16.871 --> 01:25:19.390
You're probably right.
We're all going to be gamers.
They're this,

1407
01:25:19.391 --> 01:25:23.020
this will be m this thing that like being an athlete,

1408
01:25:23.550 --> 01:25:26.860
will it?
It's not gonna make any sense in the future.

1409
01:25:26.861 --> 01:25:29.590
I believe in or maybe it will be completely ridiculous.
It's like,
oh,

1410
01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:32.530
you're not born.
You never going to be,
you have no choice.
You know what I mean?

1411
01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:36.080
And it will be real because you're not born to be an APP.

1412
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:40.540
You're not bred to be an athlete.
Yeah.
They would with gene editing with their,

1413
01:25:40.541 --> 01:25:44.860
they're going to be able to change your height.
They're going,
they can do it now.

1414
01:25:44.861 --> 01:25:45.694
They can do it now.

1415
01:25:45.790 --> 01:25:48.730
They haven't really shown that they can do it with humans in America,
at least.

1416
01:25:48.730 --> 01:25:49.210
Crazy.

1417
01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:52.330
But there are absolutely experiencing are experimenting with it all over the

1418
01:25:52.331 --> 01:25:55.440
world,
the cow and every like.
It's insane.
It's insane.

1419
01:25:55.540 --> 01:25:59.980
They're doing a lot of crazy shit.
Yeah,
and I think maybe it's a hundred years,

1420
01:25:59.981 --> 01:26:01.120
maybe it's 50 years,

1421
01:26:01.121 --> 01:26:04.430
but whatever it is in that amount of you're going to be dealing with people that

1422
01:26:04.431 --> 01:26:09.350
are basically superheroes.
Yeah.
Sport will be destroyed.
That's what when,

1423
01:26:09.351 --> 01:26:12.350
when that APP in sport it will be destroyed.
Yeah.
No,

1424
01:26:12.351 --> 01:26:15.320
I agree with sport will be finish the hundred meter.

1425
01:26:15.321 --> 01:26:20.321
Can you believe like how fricking fast a human being can be to be closer to the

1426
01:26:20.831 --> 01:26:25.250
zero second yeah.
Do you think we'll pass the bar of nine second one day?

1427
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:29.030
It's tear are radically not impossible in a way.
Like,

1428
01:26:29.031 --> 01:26:31.760
I mean I won't point there.
There's a line that you can't,

1429
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:36.140
you can't diminish that time,
but it's like a,
a charter of Zuno like you can't,

1430
01:26:36.170 --> 01:26:41.030
you know.
But if we got that sort of performance and ensuing drug decks would be,

1431
01:26:41.210 --> 01:26:44.060
but there'll probably be some sort of a side effect to it and some sort of a

1432
01:26:44.061 --> 01:26:45.790
downside to it.
You know,

1433
01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:49.910
they'd probably die younger or their tissue will diminish faster.
But who knows,

1434
01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:51.540
maybe they'll be able to regenerate stuff if,

1435
01:26:51.610 --> 01:26:55.970
if you talk to some doctor that knows,
I know you have done,

1436
01:26:56.390 --> 01:27:00.500
they said that steroid leg it performance enhancing drug if you do it,

1437
01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:04.730
if they do it well,
it's okay.
Some people don't have any side effects of it.

1438
01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:07.910
Right.
They don't abuse it.
Yes.
Yeah.
So man,

1439
01:27:07.911 --> 01:27:11.300
maybe it won't have any side effect.
Maybe everybody will be on it.

1440
01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:16.190
Maybe it will be like a,
like a iPhone will be like,
oh,
that's like,
who knows,

1441
01:27:16.191 --> 01:27:19.490
who knows the future,
who knows?
You know,
that's totally possible.
I mean we,

1442
01:27:19.491 --> 01:27:23.750
you might be in a lot of ways,
one of the last of the natural athletes.

1443
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:28.190
Maybe.
Maybe it's a few more years before we get there,
but yeah,
man,

1444
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:31.330
when I think about it,
this is going to be,
it's going to be finished.

1445
01:27:31.331 --> 01:27:32.420
It's going to be,
I don't know,

1446
01:27:32.450 --> 01:27:36.080
maybe we'll going to be video game players or whatever.

1447
01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:37.910
When you see yourself competing again,

1448
01:27:37.911 --> 01:27:41.000
how much longer do you think you'll wait out?
I mean,
you're 37 now.

1449
01:27:41.001 --> 01:27:43.640
When do you think you'll will be healthy enough?

1450
01:27:43.641 --> 01:27:45.980
When will your colitis feel good enough?

1451
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.520
Like do you have a time period to say maybe a few weeks.

1452
01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:51.680
Maybe take a few weeks,
maybe

1453
01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:58.190
one to three month Max.
Maybe maximum.
Maybe I'd be less than that.

1454
01:27:58.191 --> 01:28:02.240
Maybe less than that.
A little bit of time off.
Just a little bit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1455
01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:07.780
I want to make sure I get past that because I feel like if I go back into it and

1456
01:28:07.821 --> 01:28:11.400
I,
and it will start all over again.
I don't want that.
It was bad Jew.

1457
01:28:11.401 --> 01:28:15.530
I couldn't like,
I couldn't sleep night [inaudible] crap.
Like bad crap neg.

1458
01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:19.610
I stay up all night and add the sparing the next day and he,
oh my God.

1459
01:28:19.611 --> 01:28:23.350
It was crazy,
man.
It was very bad.
He had blood.
I had to go in the bachelor,

1460
01:28:23.351 --> 01:28:27.160
add blood,
man,
you feel like you,
you want to go to the bathroom.
I then in,

1461
01:28:27.210 --> 01:28:30.050
I think [inaudible] is the blood,
the blood that come on man,

1462
01:28:30.051 --> 01:28:32.570
that you could look at the bathroom and you see the blood.
You think it's like,

1463
01:28:32.571 --> 01:28:34.690
man,
what's wrong?
You think get like them,

1464
01:28:35.890 --> 01:28:40.820
the dream Catcher to movie with eh?
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Like it's like,

1465
01:28:40.821 --> 01:28:44.300
what the hell?
You know what I mean?
It's crazy,
man.
You're,
you're like,

1466
01:28:44.330 --> 01:28:48.080
you're like,
what's happening with me?
Am I dying?
His eye is,
it was very,

1467
01:28:48.081 --> 01:28:51.130
it was very well read.
I don't want to go back to this.
I want to make sure I,

1468
01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:51.981
I think Cara,

1469
01:28:51.981 --> 01:28:56.690
this stuff and so just maybe even a few more months of just taking care of your

1470
01:28:56.691 --> 01:29:00.540
body.
Mont Week,
week,
I want,
I want to see when I felt good,
I I lethal.

1471
01:29:00.541 --> 01:29:05.460
I let a little bit time when I felt like 100% like I don't feel anything like

1472
01:29:05.930 --> 01:29:09.200
some Thai Seville.
I when I going to eat,
I felt,
I felt not that grant,

1473
01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:12.750
not that pain,
but I,
I feel inside is something different,

1474
01:29:13.170 --> 01:29:17.750
but it's diminish every,
every week it's every month it diminished.

1475
01:29:17.751 --> 01:29:18.750
I see a difference.

1476
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:24.110
So if you do go back and you'd go back to 55 have you tried to make that cut

1477
01:29:25.471 --> 01:29:28.950
before?
I never tried and I won't.
I'm going to explain it to you.

1478
01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:33.510
I'm not a fan of weight cutting.
I think weight cutting should be

1479
01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.970
like a marathon runner,
a marathon runner.
When you train for my right on.

1480
01:29:38.971 --> 01:29:40.830
He never does a marathon in this training.

1481
01:29:41.670 --> 01:29:45.330
He does af or maybe a quarter of it,
the different things.

1482
01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:48.240
So it's not lt to lose your weight.

1483
01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:53.610
You dehydrate yourself and starving is not that bad.

1484
01:29:53.611 --> 01:29:56.430
But it is more than the hydrating dry duration problem.
Yeah.

1485
01:29:56.431 --> 01:30:01.140
I'm very worried about lt issue and I don't want this very important.

1486
01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:04.320
So when I do it,
I go all in.
I'll do like the Bisping fight.

1487
01:30:04.321 --> 01:30:07.020
I never tried to do to get my weight much.

1488
01:30:07.230 --> 01:30:11.700
It's different and you don't when you go up and go down.
But
I said yes,

1489
01:30:11.701 --> 01:30:14.220
I do it.
And I go and I,
you know what I mean?
And I do it.

1490
01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:16.260
Do you like that trail of it?

1491
01:30:16.261 --> 01:30:19.560
The excitement of the unknown kind of excite me in a way.

1492
01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:22.410
I don't know if you know,
so it's kind of an experimentation.
It's live.

1493
01:30:22.411 --> 01:30:26.850
I cannot messed up.
That's what excite me.
It's not the,
Oh,

1494
01:30:26.851 --> 01:30:30.480
I know I can't.
No,
I don't know man.
I'm going to do it now.
It's happening now.

1495
01:30:30.481 --> 01:30:33.060
That's,
that's what excite me.
Well this guy's a year,
so I was like,

1496
01:30:33.061 --> 01:30:36.150
Kevin Lee's your size.
You know,
he'd given me is about my size.

1497
01:30:36.151 --> 01:30:38.060
I think a Guy Gabby is about,

1498
01:30:38.130 --> 01:30:42.140
I think close to 200 I saw a 24 Ferguson,
is that you?

1499
01:30:42.141 --> 01:30:43.470
He was I posting picture.

1500
01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:48.471
He was 200 I never been naturally 200 like when I fought best thing at one point

1501
01:30:48.691 --> 01:30:51.770
I was almost 200 like I was like big guy at like,

1502
01:30:51.771 --> 01:30:55.140
but I was like all like water retention and I didn't feel,
I didn't feel right.

1503
01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:56.910
It was not feeling good man.

1504
01:30:57.090 --> 01:31:00.900
Kevin is a big guy and there was an article today I saw somewhere there was

1505
01:31:00.901 --> 01:31:04.110
saying,
you know the Kevin really wants a water and 65 pound weight loss.

1506
01:31:04.110 --> 01:31:07.080
Like you can't really make one 55 very much longer.

1507
01:31:07.470 --> 01:31:09.270
I think it would be the best man.
This guy,

1508
01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:14.220
I think if I look all the new guy that are coming,
it's freaking scary,

1509
01:31:14.221 --> 01:31:15.054
man.

1510
01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:19.310
I'm 37 maybe I have one or maybe two maybe three I don't know.

1511
01:31:19.311 --> 01:31:21.630
When I do my thing and I get out of there,

1512
01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:24.260
when do you think you're going to retire?
Do you have an idea?
Oh,

1513
01:31:24.530 --> 01:31:26.850
I never got a 40 you've,

1514
01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:30.090
it's impossible that I fight pass 40 I'll be impossible.

1515
01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:34.780
I'm not going to fight in a cage at four years old and it's like 37 demand is

1516
01:31:34.781 --> 01:31:38.510
that you feel a kid that played like that's our nurse wasn't a girl.

1517
01:31:38.511 --> 01:31:41.910
What he says to me is like I could that play with a train.
He's two years old,

1518
01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:44.730
three years old,
four years old,
five years old.

1519
01:31:45.870 --> 01:31:49.920
Then you look at the train when you get six years old and like the hell I'm

1520
01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:54.210
doing with that train at 40 years old is Spanish for me fighting in the cage.

1521
01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:58.570
I've done it.
It's not interesting or,
and I'm 40 years old.
I am,
I'm a,

1522
01:31:58.571 --> 01:32:01.840
I'm a grown man.
I'm not going to fight in a freaking cage at 40 years old.

1523
01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:05.950
Only 36 months from now.
You're saying you're saying it like it's forever.
Yeah,

1524
01:32:05.951 --> 01:32:09.460
exactly.
So it has to happen fast.
It has to happen fast and if it don't happen,

1525
01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:11.860
I might be,
I might be doing well.

1526
01:32:11.890 --> 01:32:15.970
The comeback alone will select one of the greatest comebacks ever to come back

1527
01:32:15.971 --> 01:32:20.790
after four years when the title beat the champion and beat him definitive

1528
01:32:20.860 --> 01:32:23.410
definitively rear naked choke,
put him to sleep.

1529
01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:27.910
That's why I drew it need to be something that really excite me.
Begin.

1530
01:32:27.911 --> 01:32:31.420
I'm going to tell you something.
One of my friends,
CT Fletcher,

1531
01:32:31.421 --> 01:32:33.190
he says something also CT Fletcher,

1532
01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:37.450
just that as a heart transplant and he's going good now.
He said,

1533
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:40.420
I love to CT CT,

1534
01:32:40.930 --> 01:32:45.610
you're at the inspiration man.
See d your inspiration man.
I love that guy.

1535
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:49.900
He says sets his faction.
Is that Dev Dev blue and it's true.

1536
01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:51.880
Now I'm happy,
I'm satisfied.

1537
01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:56.620
But if I see something on satisfaction as what was he says deaf.
Blue is finish.

1538
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:58.120
If you're satisfied,

1539
01:32:58.900 --> 01:33:03.340
if you're a champion and you satisfy your retirement because you're going down,

1540
01:33:03.370 --> 01:33:06.730
you finish going to get hurt.
As an athlete,

1541
01:33:06.731 --> 01:33:09.970
especially in game not and everything I do,

1542
01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:14.410
I go further and further.
That's why I didn't want this fight Nate Diaz.

1543
01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:19.720
Cause I've,
I fight Nate Diaz.
If it's been done before,
it's been,

1544
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:20.650
it's not excite.

1545
01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:24.880
Excite that for me and I would be going into that fight,

1546
01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:28.900
satisfy and if I could do that,
I'm going to,
it's very dangerous.

1547
01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:33.580
I want to do something that I'm like,
like the one 55 I'm like,

1548
01:33:33.581 --> 01:33:34.900
I never did it before.

1549
01:33:34.930 --> 01:33:39.930
Title or beating a certain guy that ease on that freak and the rise and beat

1550
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:44.620
them because ebay already beaten Connor.
Go be be.
It could be.

1551
01:33:44.621 --> 01:33:49.621
I don't know if they're new guy that do something that is unbeatable and may I

1552
01:33:49.691 --> 01:33:53.560
come back,
I'm like,
oh George never going to be that.
It may just say never man.

1553
01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:57.820
I love it.
They say never when they are not as as it is.

1554
01:33:57.830 --> 01:34:00.880
And when he said never going to come back am I could excite me.

1555
01:34:00.881 --> 01:34:04.790
And when you say I cannot do that,
it's never been done before.
That's mean.

1556
01:34:04.791 --> 01:34:07.390
If I do it,
it would be the first time that excited me.

1557
01:34:07.540 --> 01:34:09.040
That really turned me on as,

1558
01:34:09.041 --> 01:34:10.790
but there's a lot of things that turned me on in life is,

1559
01:34:10.791 --> 01:34:14.900
is a woman dinosaurs and this,
the people that say,
you don't,

1560
01:34:14.901 --> 01:34:18.160
I don't that really going crazy.

1561
01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:21.590
Dinosaurs body ontologies is up.
Can I really love?

1562
01:34:22.810 --> 01:34:26.680
Wow.
That's awesome.
I traveled the world during those four years off,
by the way,

1563
01:34:26.681 --> 01:34:30.070
that,
did you?
Yeah.
Did you do during those four years off?
I was,

1564
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:35.840
I trouble a lot of the world on the site.
On a sightseeing.
Yeah.

1565
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:37.460
I W I wouldn't ever be that.

1566
01:34:37.461 --> 01:34:40.270
That made me realize too that I could never be a paleontologist.

1567
01:34:40.271 --> 01:34:44.750
I don't have the patience to go like a toothbrush for hours.

1568
01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:49.210
I like to get the knowledge of it to be on the field,
to get the knowledge fast,

1569
01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:52.240
but I don't like to work together.
Not as dry,

1570
01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:54.900
which make me not that real cardiologists.

1571
01:34:55.610 --> 01:35:00.290
They find out that they're just as willing put the work into it.
Yeah.
In MMA,

1572
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:05.090
I'm willing to pour the work into it to become the champion,
you know,

1573
01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:08.720
but then pan out.
That's how I,
I,
because I want point.

1574
01:35:08.721 --> 01:35:13.270
I thought I liked both equally.
Now I realize,
no,
I like the sport better.

1575
01:35:13.290 --> 01:35:17.630
Album of the sport of MMA is so exciting and paleontology is probably very

1576
01:35:17.631 --> 01:35:20.330
exciting once you find like a t rex head or something like that.

1577
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:22.880
Is that knowledge?
The knowledge is exciting.

1578
01:35:23.590 --> 01:35:27.250
I mean I have a thing in every month.
Every time they have a discoveries,

1579
01:35:27.290 --> 01:35:29.770
it's in my phone.
Oh,
APP.
Yes.

1580
01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:32.660
Every time is a new discovery or something like boom.

1581
01:35:33.290 --> 01:35:34.690
And my friend that make fun of me,
they're like,

1582
01:35:34.860 --> 01:35:37.890
<v 2>then you fight it a cage.
You beat up people.</v>

1583
01:35:37.891 --> 01:35:39.780
Why didn't you like paleontology was real.
We do

1584
01:35:40.110 --> 01:35:44.760
<v 0>cause they make fun of me.
I went in Argentina,
in them,
in a Patagonia.</v>

1585
01:35:45.110 --> 01:35:49.330
I was there too with uh,
patio,
Telogis,

1586
01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.610
bio biologists and uh,

1587
01:35:51.690 --> 01:35:55.440
and and microbiologists to four have an on site,
you know.

1588
01:35:55.441 --> 01:35:58.870
And I had that blast,
man,
it was amazing.
But people is,
I,

1589
01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:04.280
Georges is gone and that Freakin bad land and buy like I loan is a laden for the

1590
01:36:05.011 --> 01:36:06.500
rest of the world too,

1591
01:36:08.890 --> 01:36:11.580
to do that kind of stuff.
But you know,
so they were making fun.

1592
01:36:11.710 --> 01:36:16.660
Did you find anything?
I did not find it,
but I went on site.
I saw eggs.

1593
01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:21.070
I saw a sauropod remains tight dinosaurs.
They're there.

1594
01:36:21.071 --> 01:36:23.470
These are the still in the ground when you were there,

1595
01:36:23.650 --> 01:36:28.510
like they're fine eating it.
Yeah,
but Julie thinks it's a long process,
man.

1596
01:36:28.511 --> 01:36:28.940
Yeah,

1597
01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:33.940
it does that mean that as been covered for at least like 66 million years,

1598
01:36:34.451 --> 01:36:37.120
man.
You talk about light and the place where I was,
it was,

1599
01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:40.440
it was a early cretaceous.
I know it was eight grade they should have,

1600
01:36:40.441 --> 01:36:42.700
but it was like a hundred million years.
So that's mean.

1601
01:36:42.940 --> 01:36:47.270
It did not get exposed to oxygen for a hundred million years.

1602
01:36:47.271 --> 01:36:50.710
That's where you get,
so you,
it's like a crime scene man.

1603
01:36:50.711 --> 01:36:54.040
Where go into these thing.
It's Frickin there,
man.

1604
01:36:54.041 --> 01:36:55.690
It's like a crime scene that you discover,

1605
01:36:55.691 --> 01:36:59.230
but like I like a hundred million years quite seen man.

1606
01:36:59.260 --> 01:37:03.130
You see these soul rapids robots,
these dinosaurs.
It's insane,
man.

1607
01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.560
What's crazy too,
that it's not even really a bone anymore.

1608
01:37:05.561 --> 01:37:10.360
The mineral has replaced the bone and you just get the shape of the bone that's

1609
01:37:10.361 --> 01:37:12.430
sort of been fossilized.
Yeah.

1610
01:37:12.940 --> 01:37:15.370
That's why if you see like mega don teeth,

1611
01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:19.900
they're black and milds that Miguel is crazy.
It's insane.

1612
01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:24.480
Man May got it done just like the strongest bite.
Fourth ever recorded,
man.

1613
01:37:24.490 --> 01:37:28.710
It's crazy.
It's a big fucking animal.
It was a huge fish.
Yeah,
just shoot it.

1614
01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:32.730
Feed on wells like it's crazy.
But I,

1615
01:37:33.390 --> 01:37:35.400
this is one of the things that I really excited me,

1616
01:37:35.401 --> 01:37:38.640
so during those four years I was doing,
man,
I had to add a blast.

1617
01:37:38.641 --> 01:37:43.350
I didn't have that time to do it before that and I felt like it was missing in

1618
01:37:43.351 --> 01:37:47.280
my life.
Really?
Paleontology man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's fascinating.

1619
01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:48.360
I went down to Alberta.

1620
01:37:48.361 --> 01:37:53.361
I went all swing the in m and a that quota and United States that want to go in

1621
01:37:53.431 --> 01:37:56.730
Egypt and Egypt and Morocco.

1622
01:37:57.010 --> 01:38:00.620
There was some site that they were once upon a time.
He was like,

1623
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:04.020
like I'm talking about this,
probably be,
nobody cares,
but I,
I love it.

1624
01:38:04.510 --> 01:38:08.750
They were like treat giant,
giant Apex Burnett's or living in the same,
uh,

1625
01:38:08.970 --> 01:38:12.530
like a giant crocodile sarco,
sue sushis,
Karch,
Armando,

1626
01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:14.400
Zuora and a spinal sores.

1627
01:38:14.700 --> 01:38:19.700
These two live in the same area and wonder what happened like Tree Alpha

1628
01:38:21.090 --> 01:38:23.220
freaking Predator if we're living in at the same time.

1629
01:38:23.221 --> 01:38:26.060
And I wonder if they interact with each other and it would,

1630
01:38:26.190 --> 01:38:27.900
it must have been a crazy time man.

1631
01:38:28.110 --> 01:38:33.110
I have a friend and one of his good friends has a ranch in Montana and uh,

1632
01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:38.360
he found something on the ranch and he called this a paleontologist and they

1633
01:38:38.821 --> 01:38:42.300
went to his ranch and they shut the place down.
Like,
dude,
you got a t rex here.

1634
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:46.410
Really?
Yeah.
They gave him over a million dollars for it.
Yeah.

1635
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:49.230
And they escalated this t rex and his,
his ranch.

1636
01:38:49.231 --> 01:38:53.190
And apparently it was a really good specimen.
Can either,
if you find something,

1637
01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:58.230
it's part of it,
it belongs to the government.
Let's say.

1638
01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:02.880
Let's say,
let's say you find a bone in your backyard.
It doesn't belong to you.

1639
01:39:03.410 --> 01:39:07.340
Can you believe it locked up?
Yeah.
That's sack van.
This is very bad.
Americans.

1640
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:09.690
Got You guys beat for that?
When I was young Joe,

1641
01:39:09.691 --> 01:39:12.620
I remember I used to live in countryside.
I used to go with it,

1642
01:39:12.860 --> 01:39:14.370
try to go with find bones,

1643
01:39:14.371 --> 01:39:17.520
but I didn't know back then I was not educated as I thought.

1644
01:39:17.521 --> 01:39:20.760
Maybe I could find dynasts I was spending hours and finding,

1645
01:39:20.850 --> 01:39:23.840
trying to find dinosaur that everywhere,
like I took,
I thought it was a dinosaur.

1646
01:39:23.841 --> 01:39:28.530
I used to bring it back.
Am I?
My mom is a,
yeah,
it's a dyno.
Sorry.
I stayed,
yeah,

1647
01:39:28.531 --> 01:39:31.320
right there because it was kind of a triangular shape.

1648
01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:34.770
But then I found out that all of that place where I come from,

1649
01:39:34.771 --> 01:39:36.420
it was all erosion.

1650
01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:40.570
So there is nothing from Cretaceous or Jurassic Triassic backdate.

1651
01:39:40.590 --> 01:39:45.390
It's all like before that.
So it's all gone.
So it's just crazy,

1652
01:39:45.391 --> 01:39:48.870
man.
It has been a long time.
I was in Montana once and the,

1653
01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:53.790
there's this area that used to be the great western inland sea and this,

1654
01:39:53.791 --> 01:39:57.900
uh,
this area,
like the ground is like this mucky ground,

1655
01:39:57.901 --> 01:40:02.700
especially when it rains,
it's essentially silt,
like the bottom of a lake,

1656
01:40:02.701 --> 01:40:03.850
you know?
That's because it was a,

1657
01:40:03.851 --> 01:40:08.170
it was like a seat in between saying cutting the,
I met the,

1658
01:40:08.171 --> 01:40:11.310
the cutting and the America in Af.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1659
01:40:11.311 --> 01:40:15.930
And so last year and lateral media to conduct,
you know,

1660
01:40:15.931 --> 01:40:17.510
all about that.
Knowing this man,

1661
01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:22.470
I know as much as I met me with this daily almost.
Yeah.
Wow.
Maybe not,

1662
01:40:22.471 --> 01:40:25.230
but I am passionate with this man a long time.

1663
01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:28.050
It's fascinating when you're walking around this area in Montana,

1664
01:40:28.051 --> 01:40:32.190
it's called the Missouri breaks and uh,
because this,
uh,
this ground,

1665
01:40:32.250 --> 01:40:35.670
it does feel like,
you know,
if you've ever like seen a lake bed,

1666
01:40:35.671 --> 01:40:39.660
if the water recedes,
it's got that silty sort of weird mud.
This is all,

1667
01:40:39.661 --> 01:40:42.710
the whole ground is like this.
It sticks to your boots.
Like it,

1668
01:40:42.711 --> 01:40:47.640
it gets heavy and comps on the bottom of your boots.
Like this muck,
maybe it,
man,

1669
01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:52.020
we don't know what the future would look like,
man.
Eh,
sometime I'm thinking too,

1670
01:40:52.021 --> 01:40:55.250
I'm like,
you know what?
People talk about the environment and they say,
oh,

1671
01:40:55.570 --> 01:40:59.430
the pollution will make,
we have hot hair,
an ice age hot here.

1672
01:40:59.830 --> 01:41:03.430
It's been going forever.
But what I'm thinking,
I'm like,
yeah,
okay.

1673
01:41:03.431 --> 01:41:07.720
Of course the pollution and the human as an effect on the climate,
the climate.

1674
01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:12.100
But I wonder how much of the,
um,
how big we have an ethic.

1675
01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:16.930
Some people say is it's debatable,
is it,
is it that big or is not that big?

1676
01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:20.380
Some some sizes,
yes,
it is bad.
Some says,
yeah,
it's bad ways.

1677
01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.490
We don't have that much of an effect.
As you know,
we,
I don't know about that.

1678
01:41:24.491 --> 01:41:27.360
I would like to have a clear answer to two to four days.
I think.

1679
01:41:27.460 --> 01:41:28.870
I think we have an effect,
but I like,

1680
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:32.580
I wonder how now we're going into a hot here.

1681
01:41:32.590 --> 01:41:37.030
The glacier or for our,
our are melting,
but the hot hair,

1682
01:41:37.570 --> 01:41:41.920
we'll uh,
we'll,
we'll go to a,
an ice age,

1683
01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:45.130
you know that,
right?
Because of the current and everything.
So I wonder how,

1684
01:41:45.190 --> 01:41:48.610
you know,
how much of an effect and how long it'll take.
You know,

1685
01:41:48.611 --> 01:41:52.570
because we don't have any record,
recent record of all long.
Everything takes,

1686
01:41:52.571 --> 01:41:56.620
we know a little bit,
but not that much.
You know,
it's a fascinating subject.
Yeah,

1687
01:41:56.621 --> 01:41:59.950
man,
it would be,
are we going to live through that time?
Probably not,

1688
01:41:59.951 --> 01:42:02.590
but I'm leaving.
You know what I mean?
It's like how long it will take.

1689
01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:05.570
I'm very interesting about that.
That's why I love the,
these things.

1690
01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:08.470
Learning from that past make you understand something,

1691
01:42:08.471 --> 01:42:13.290
the present and in the future I may I think is really interesting.
Yeah,
no I'm,

1692
01:42:13.291 --> 01:42:14.440
I'm very fascinated by it.

1693
01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:18.490
Are you still interested in aliens that's demand this deal?

1694
01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:22.030
So that's the thing.
When I first came on your show,
yeah,

1695
01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:26.170
you cut me really off guard because Bruno's most,

1696
01:42:26.171 --> 01:42:28.660
most people that we talk about aliens,

1697
01:42:28.661 --> 01:42:31.930
they completely think you're crazy or you're disregards I,

1698
01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:33.910
Yah you got to talk about like,
you know they,
they,

1699
01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:37.330
most people that I attract with their,
you know,
they,
they,

1700
01:42:37.690 --> 01:42:40.600
so you feel like ridicules then I,

1701
01:42:40.601 --> 01:42:43.570
and then after I find out you read a lot about that stuff,

1702
01:42:43.571 --> 01:42:44.920
like the Sumerian texts,

1703
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:49.750
the creation tablets like a rescission and all that stuff.
And I do too.
I mean,

1704
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:52.270
I don't know if there is,

1705
01:42:52.930 --> 01:42:56.910
if there is early on that like I think they would be life form.
I don't.

1706
01:42:56.930 --> 01:43:00.400
If it's intelligence,
we don't have evidence for it and I think,

1707
01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:05.460
or ego as human being want us to believe that the alien came and interact with

1708
01:43:07.451 --> 01:43:09.040
us.
That's our ego.

1709
01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:13.360
But if they're that far advanced from us and they come from a different,

1710
01:43:13.361 --> 01:43:17.170
well maybe they don't want to interact because we have nothing to offer them.

1711
01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:20.860
They're not going to conduct a farmer and ask him what kind of suspension is

1712
01:43:20.861 --> 01:43:23.990
wearing.
You know what I mean?
Like they,
they don't get,
you know what I mean?

1713
01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:27.100
But think about what you just said about paleontology.

1714
01:43:27.250 --> 01:43:30.730
I mean we're paying attention to the stupid fucking lizards that lived 65

1715
01:43:30.730 --> 01:43:32.110
million years ago.
It's true.
I mean,

1716
01:43:32.111 --> 01:43:35.350
don't you think there would be curious to this weird monkey with nuclear
weapons?

1717
01:43:35.370 --> 01:43:38.770
Yeah,
but we don't communicate with it.
We don't take direct.
We observe.

1718
01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:42.670
There's ways that you can learn from us without communicate.
I don't know.

1719
01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:47.320
I mean it's,
I think it's our ego that make us,
we want to feel special.

1720
01:43:47.321 --> 01:43:52.160
We want to feel that
like,
oh,
we were different,
you know,

1721
01:43:52.161 --> 01:43:56.780
like we were different beans then.
For example,
a Doug or,
yeah,

1722
01:43:56.781 --> 01:44:00.310
we can think because we're smart,
but like,
I dunno,

1723
01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:03.700
how would this have been giving,
giving to a cycad oh no.
You know,
and I,

1724
01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:08.950
and you were talking about it like when I was young,
I used to have uh,

1725
01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:12.990
like you talk about the last time you said,
ah,
you,

1726
01:44:12.991 --> 01:44:14.900
you were talking about like the experience.

1727
01:44:14.901 --> 01:44:19.901
I said I remembered that I remembered but I can't recall it when I was,

1728
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:24.200
when I was young ad I don't if it's a dream,
I remember I used to dry,

1729
01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:28.800
I used to draw a figure of bud store.
I say my mom is a,
is the amount sir.

1730
01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:32.120
They come get me at night.
That I was,
that's why I,

1731
01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:33.570
that that's what we talked last time.

1732
01:44:34.590 --> 01:44:38.600
I was very uncomfortable and I didn't want to talk about it because I was like,

1733
01:44:38.601 --> 01:44:41.210
man,
how the hell do you nosy,
you know,
everything man,
this guy,

1734
01:44:41.211 --> 01:44:44.780
he knows everything.
He may research and stuff.
So I,
I'm,
I made,

1735
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:49.490
I made the drawing and,
and uh,
then my,
my mom,

1736
01:44:49.491 --> 01:44:53.440
even though today I said,
hey,
I want to,
I want to see the drawing,
you know,

1737
01:44:53.441 --> 01:44:58.430
like I,
and I,
and I showed the drawing and I'm like,
and then I,
then after,

1738
01:44:58.431 --> 01:45:03.260
I remember later I rem,
I remember that.
I remember,

1739
01:45:03.261 --> 01:45:05.120
but I couldn't remember.
You understand what I mean?

1740
01:45:05.150 --> 01:45:08.270
I remembered that I remembered that something that happened,

1741
01:45:08.300 --> 01:45:13.160
but now I can't remember what exactly happened.
Could be a nightmare.

1742
01:45:13.161 --> 01:45:14.480
It could be another slip,

1743
01:45:14.481 --> 01:45:18.380
sleep paralysis or paralysis in my imagination.

1744
01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:20.420
I don't have evidence,
you know what I mean?

1745
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:23.870
And that's what we talk about it last time.
And,
uh,
that's,

1746
01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:28.580
that's what happened to me.
And,
and,
and,
and I hope,
I hope,
I hope it's nightmare.

1747
01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:31.460
It's a nightmare.
You know what I mean?
But the thing is,

1748
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.850
later on I saw some documentary on TV.

1749
01:45:34.851 --> 01:45:38.600
I saw some people that had a similar experience as me,

1750
01:45:38.770 --> 01:45:42.830
loss of memory and things like this when they were young and they claimed day,

1751
01:45:42.831 --> 01:45:46.060
they get a,
they get to hypnosis and stuff.
Then they,
they,
they,

1752
01:45:46.061 --> 01:45:49.350
they go back and time and they explained to get an abducted by Alan.

1753
01:45:49.380 --> 01:45:52.430
Then I start to freak out about it because I,
I send them.

1754
01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:55.190
Is it that what happened to me and then I,
but there was more,

1755
01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:57.920
a lot more logical explanation,
you know what I mean?

1756
01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:01.340
But that's why when you brought that back,
I freaked out.
I was like,
oh,

1757
01:46:01.450 --> 01:46:04.660
daddy knows this.
Like how the hell he knows this.
I,
I,

1758
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:08.410
I didn't want to talk about it.
But then he,
then it was also,
my agent was there.

1759
01:46:08.411 --> 01:46:11.020
He was like,
Hey,
we need it in 10 minutes.
I'm going,
I,
I didn't,

1760
01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:14.270
we were misinformed.
We didn't know what that podcast was.
I that long in this,

1761
01:46:14.271 --> 01:46:16.850
out of the high,
all of these things in my head,
I baby,
we've been,

1762
01:46:16.851 --> 01:46:21.350
I didn't know what to make of it,
you know?
So that,
that's what it was.
Yeah.

1763
01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:25.940
It's entirely possible that we're experiencing something when we're dreaming

1764
01:46:26.210 --> 01:46:28.340
that were angry,
sleeping well,
maybe unconscious,

1765
01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:32.930
that maybe there's dimensions that consciousness travels too that are

1766
01:46:32.931 --> 01:46:36.650
nonphysical that like this,
this dimension,
what we're in right now.

1767
01:46:36.651 --> 01:46:39.980
We could touch this table,
move this microphone around.

1768
01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:41.750
These are physical dimensions,

1769
01:46:41.751 --> 01:46:46.751
but it's entirely possible that whatever your spirit is or your consciousness or

1770
01:46:46.791 --> 01:46:50.340
your,
your mind,
when,
when,
when you're thinking of your thoughts

1771
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:55.110
<v 1>and your soul that you say you're,
you said you're a soul.
Yeah.</v>

1772
01:46:55.111 --> 01:46:57.840
Whatever that means you believe is this is a soul.
You believe.

1773
01:46:57.841 --> 01:47:01.030
You don't know what that means.
It's a weird word,
right?
It's a real,

1774
01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:03.690
it has religious connotations,
but,
but the,

1775
01:47:03.691 --> 01:47:07.470
the idea of whatever your essence is as a human being,
there's,

1776
01:47:07.471 --> 01:47:11.850
there's something inside of all of us that makes us conscious and aware and,

1777
01:47:11.851 --> 01:47:15.660
and there and then that something is not there when you're sleeping.

1778
01:47:16.050 --> 01:47:20.110
And so is it dormant?
Is it just recovering,
which is,
you know,

1779
01:47:20.130 --> 01:47:21.450
the scientific version of it?

1780
01:47:21.630 --> 01:47:26.630
Or is it possible that while you're in this dream state in your body shuts off,

1781
01:47:27.690 --> 01:47:32.690
that your mind and your consciousness travels to a nonphysical dimension that

1782
01:47:33.841 --> 01:47:37.200
you can only access through the chemicals that are released in your brain,

1783
01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:40.710
which we know produce psychedelic experiences.

1784
01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:45.660
So if you took the chemicals that are released during your brain or inside your

1785
01:47:45.661 --> 01:47:49.320
brain,
like dimethyl trip to me and,
and uh,
there,

1786
01:47:49.321 --> 01:47:53.730
there's all sorts of different psychedelic chemicals that are produced by the

1787
01:47:53.731 --> 01:47:58.410
mind.
If you take these outside of,
you know,
the dream state,

1788
01:47:58.620 --> 01:48:00.720
if you take these drugs,
you have these crazy,

1789
01:48:00.721 --> 01:48:04.740
fantastic experiences and we know these are produced by the brain.
They produce,

1790
01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:07.530
they produced by the brain.
Now they're produced by the brain,

1791
01:48:07.590 --> 01:48:09.480
then produced by the liver and the lungs.

1792
01:48:09.670 --> 01:48:13.290
We believe they're produced by your third eye,
which is your pineal gland.

1793
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:16.920
They've shown the cottonwood research foundation has shown that this,

1794
01:48:16.921 --> 01:48:21.090
this is done in rats.
The rats produced dimethyltryptamine in their pineal gland.

1795
01:48:21.150 --> 01:48:22.830
It doesn't necessarily mean that people do,

1796
01:48:22.831 --> 01:48:25.950
but it's logical to imply that people probably,

1797
01:48:25.951 --> 01:48:28.980
or conclude the people probably do it as well.
So those,

1798
01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:34.040
those chemicals that are producing these psychedelic experiences are being

1799
01:48:34.381 --> 01:48:36.480
released by the brain.
But we don't know why.

1800
01:48:36.481 --> 01:48:39.840
And we don't know what they're doing.
Well wait,
when,
when you sleep that guy,

1801
01:48:39.841 --> 01:48:43.650
that guy at Metro Walker,
yes.
It was amazing.
Right?
When you sleep,
you're,

1802
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:48.100
you're a guardian.
You're logic is not there.
That part of your brain.
Yeah.

1803
01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:52.170
So we could,
that's probably the most Ajay called exper experience,

1804
01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:57.490
but it's,
it's kind of a freaking scary thought of thinking that man is like,

1805
01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:01.410
it makes me wonder sometime sometime you at night that you're at night that loan

1806
01:49:01.411 --> 01:49:03.780
and you were thinking then,
I mean I'm my guide,
I think I left,
you know,

1807
01:49:03.781 --> 01:49:06.650
I'm thinking about all kinds of scenario.
Like in a fight I fight.

1808
01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:09.720
Think about a all of a sudden,
oh by the knife.
On the same way you thinking,

1809
01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:14.710
what if this happened for real?
Or what if like,

1810
01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:19.470
man,
it's sick care.
We talk,
man.
It's,
it's,
it's a,

1811
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:22.660
it's just nothing more scary in the world.
Well,
what is scarier?

1812
01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:27.270
Is it scary to think that when you die you're just gone and nothing happens?

1813
01:49:27.271 --> 01:49:31.950
Or is it scary to think that your consciousness leaves this physical dimension

1814
01:49:32.130 --> 01:49:35.520
and goes into what's essentially a well of souls?

1815
01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:40.080
Just a dimension,
a nonphysical dimension of consciousness.

1816
01:49:40.230 --> 01:49:43.260
We're all consciousness interacts with each other and it's just geometric

1817
01:49:43.261 --> 01:49:48.150
patterns that don't have a,
a physical being attached to them.
It's,
it's,

1818
01:49:48.190 --> 01:49:53.190
<v 0>it's hard for me to believe the consciousness is not material material.</v>

1819
01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.980
Cause that's how you would say sometime people have,
they say,

1820
01:49:56.981 --> 01:49:58.630
oh he's a good person,
is a bad person.

1821
01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:03.040
I don't believe there is good and bad person.
I believe there is no people,

1822
01:50:03.250 --> 01:50:05.020
no baby born good or bad,

1823
01:50:05.021 --> 01:50:08.620
I believe is your environment and that makes that shape you.

1824
01:50:08.621 --> 01:50:10.940
And it has a lot to do with it.
[inaudible] have a lot to do.

1825
01:50:10.941 --> 01:50:15.370
And when you say they the mine,
let's say I'm a surfer,
I'm a person,

1826
01:50:15.371 --> 01:50:18.640
I'm a certain way,
you know me and as a certain way and it happened to me.

1827
01:50:18.641 --> 01:50:22.330
I know I have a friend that happened to him.
It was my best friend and he,

1828
01:50:22.331 --> 01:50:25.780
and he's dead now.
Unfortunately the Di,
it was a certain way,

1829
01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:30.910
but he got a car accident.
I remember after his car accident,
he changed man.

1830
01:50:30.910 --> 01:50:33.960
He was not that same guy.
He become a little bit paranoid.
Yes,

1831
01:50:33.961 --> 01:50:37.660
I've kind of dementia.
Yeah.
So the person I knew

1832
01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:43.980
was kind of dead.
Yeah,
but it was physically Ed,

1833
01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:48.480
the DNA,
everything was the same.
But is this,
the person is different.
Right.

1834
01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:50.800
So when you say it,
the soul,
the mind,

1835
01:50:51.670 --> 01:50:55.750
if we'd be really not material lake,
my materialistic,

1836
01:50:55.751 --> 01:51:00.160
that would not have changed.
But his personality was completely different.
See,

1837
01:51:00.210 --> 01:51:04.060
he had a short temper.
I remember he had a girlfriend,
was extremely jealous.

1838
01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:08.440
He was starting to beat her and stuff.
It was completely different.

1839
01:51:08.530 --> 01:51:13.120
Completely different person that you knew before.
So if they say it,
the mine,

1840
01:51:13.150 --> 01:51:17.020
your brain,
your brain is materialism,

1841
01:51:17.050 --> 01:51:20.740
but your mind is not.
So if you have it,
if you'd be,

1842
01:51:20.741 --> 01:51:24.260
if you have like if you have an accident like my friend and me,

1843
01:51:24.270 --> 01:51:27.680
but you have some sort of dementia or something that's mean.

1844
01:51:27.681 --> 01:51:31.210
If it's not materialism,
it would not happen.
It's possible,

1845
01:51:31.211 --> 01:51:36.211
but it's hard to say and you have the explanation that are like,

1846
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:41.080
oh,
subjective and objective.
If I pinch you,
you say I'm a hurt.

1847
01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:46.540
There is no objective way to for me to to tell you that you really hurt because

1848
01:51:46.541 --> 01:51:48.910
even if I go away,
I'll open your brain.
I can't see it,

1849
01:51:48.970 --> 01:51:50.980
but you know the only way I know it's because of my experience,

1850
01:51:50.981 --> 01:51:55.570
but it can't prove it.
Right.
It's a fucking who knows.
Who knows.

1851
01:51:56.050 --> 01:51:56.320
It also

1852
01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:01.030
<v 1>possible that when you think of consciousness or the soul or the what's going on</v>

1853
01:52:01.031 --> 01:52:02.470
in the mind that is,

1854
01:52:02.471 --> 01:52:06.850
it's expressed through the body and then with the body is damaged,

1855
01:52:06.970 --> 01:52:10.810
that consciousness is damaged as well because your consciousness is now being

1856
01:52:10.811 --> 01:52:15.700
expressed through a lack of certain hormones.
Your,
your,

1857
01:52:15.701 --> 01:52:17.710
your,
your,
your mind itself.

1858
01:52:17.711 --> 01:52:22.711
The very brain might be an antenna or a something that uses consciousness in

1859
01:52:24.821 --> 01:52:26.290
order to move through life,

1860
01:52:26.291 --> 01:52:30.190
but that consciousness is independent from the brain and that the brain being

1861
01:52:30.191 --> 01:52:31.000
damaged.

1862
01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.260
It's just expressing consciousness in a fucked up way because you've got

1863
01:52:35.261 --> 01:52:40.240
dementia or Parkinson's or what other neurological disorders that people have.

1864
01:52:40.330 --> 01:52:42.970
But at the center of it,
it's still the same thing.

1865
01:52:42.971 --> 01:52:47.240
It's one of the things that people say when they have,
let's say you die,

1866
01:52:47.241 --> 01:52:50.310
you finish,
and then the best out of you will,

1867
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:53.750
you mean we're still exists somewhere or somewhere in that of you,

1868
01:52:53.751 --> 01:52:57.940
but you independent of the body,
and this is just theories.
There's,

1869
01:52:57.950 --> 01:53:02.120
there are people that believe that consciousness is nonlocal and that the body

1870
01:53:02.210 --> 01:53:05.270
actually is just like an antenna for your consciousness.
Now,

1871
01:53:05.271 --> 01:53:09.260
if the body is damaged,
if your hormonal balance is all fucked up,

1872
01:53:09.261 --> 01:53:11.880
your neurological system is out of whack.
You like,

1873
01:53:11.900 --> 01:53:14.780
one of the things that Muhammad Ali said,
uh,

1874
01:53:14.810 --> 01:53:19.520
when they were talking to him about his Parkinson's is that he's still in there.

1875
01:53:19.670 --> 01:53:24.670
He just can't express himself because his body had been damaged by so many

1876
01:53:25.101 --> 01:53:25.620
fights,

1877
01:53:25.620 --> 01:53:30.200
so many hard sparring sessions and so many blows to the head that he wasn't

1878
01:53:30.201 --> 01:53:31.970
capable of expressing himself.

1879
01:53:31.971 --> 01:53:35.210
But inside he was still the same guy but he was trapped.

1880
01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:38.450
His consciousness was trapped in a broken body.
I see.

1881
01:53:38.451 --> 01:53:39.560
It's like that like a prison,

1882
01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:45.160
like a locomotion system and you know when you think about CTE,

1883
01:53:45.561 --> 01:53:48.940
like a lot of these football players like you know that Aaron Hernandez guy that

1884
01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:52.850
was a murderer and he was a football player and they examine his brain after he

1885
01:53:52.851 --> 01:53:57.290
was dead and like this is one of the worst cases of CTE we've ever seen after he

1886
01:53:57.291 --> 01:53:58.400
killed himself in prison,

1887
01:53:58.490 --> 01:54:03.490
they examined him and the the idea is that your consciousness is supposed to be

1888
01:54:04.401 --> 01:54:06.560
expressing itself through a healthy brain,

1889
01:54:06.710 --> 01:54:10.790
right through healthy hormones and healthy endocrine system,

1890
01:54:10.791 --> 01:54:15.500
a healthy neurological system and that in that way your,
your brain can,

1891
01:54:15.540 --> 01:54:20.540
your consciousness can express itself and do so without any physical hindrances.

1892
01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:25.640
Then there's also psychological,
what is lt?
I wise age,

1893
01:54:26.050 --> 01:54:30.320
but what age are you at the,
at the moment you start breeding and living,

1894
01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:34.340
there's some sort of change that occurred in your so,
sure.
Yeah.

1895
01:54:34.370 --> 01:54:36.530
What is that Lt State?

1896
01:54:36.650 --> 01:54:40.720
That's 1512 one years old at an then,
right.
One years old.

1897
01:54:40.730 --> 01:54:44.270
You're not that same person at 15 and 15.
You're not that same as 30.

1898
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:47.390
I think it's pretty or not.
That's same.
My 60 I think they're not,

1899
01:54:47.420 --> 01:54:51.320
there's no independence.
I think they're all connected.
And I think that,
you know,

1900
01:54:52.220 --> 01:54:55.790
the,
the physical vitality of the body is important.

1901
01:54:55.791 --> 01:54:59.930
The vitality of the mines important.
But I think there's probably something,

1902
01:54:59.931 --> 01:55:04.550
you know,
when the first time I saw a real dead body,
like up close was,
uh,

1903
01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:08.540
my grandfather,
my grandfather died and uh,
you know,
went to the funeral,

1904
01:55:08.541 --> 01:55:10.490
they had an open casket.
It's very strange.

1905
01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:13.010
But one thing that I realized when I was standing there,
I'm like,

1906
01:55:13.011 --> 01:55:17.360
he's not even there.
He's not here.
Like,
he's not here.
It's this body.

1907
01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:20.540
I mean,
this might have been where my grandfather lived.

1908
01:55:20.541 --> 01:55:22.820
He might've lived in this body,
but he's not here anymore.

1909
01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:27.230
It was a very strange feeling to me because it was like internally I realized

1910
01:55:27.240 --> 01:55:27.750
something.

1911
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:32.060
I get the fact that he's dead and he's not moving his body and he's been

1912
01:55:32.061 --> 01:55:35.150
embalmed and they put makeup on you and all this weird shit,

1913
01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:40.040
but it was also this feeling like he's not there.
He's gone.
Yeah.
You know?

1914
01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:43.980
What is it?
The body then is the body of vehicle for whatever

1915
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:48.780
<v 0>you are.
Yeah.
Maybe one day we'll know my,
maybe we won't.</v>

1916
01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:54.090
It's very,
it's a really,
it's one of those questions.
It's conceptual.

1917
01:55:54.091 --> 01:55:55.050
It's also,
you know,

1918
01:55:55.051 --> 01:55:58.260
people have their ideological reasons for believing one thing or another.

1919
01:55:58.410 --> 01:56:00.360
There's people that are nihilist and think,
you know,

1920
01:56:00.361 --> 01:56:04.110
it's over when it's over and then you go to black and that's it.
You're done.

1921
01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:06.560
End of story.
Nothing happens when you're dead,

1922
01:56:06.570 --> 01:56:09.790
but you don't know that because you're never die.
We can't know.
Yeah.
It's,

1923
01:56:09.791 --> 01:56:14.170
it's a real,
it's a real open ended questions.
I'm on that same page as you.

1924
01:56:14.171 --> 01:56:15.870
If I do this,
I,
I do not know.

1925
01:56:16.410 --> 01:56:20.430
I a lot of idea has been presented to me.
A lot of the idea,

1926
01:56:20.431 --> 01:56:24.810
I reject it because it didn't make sense to me logically,
like descent,

1927
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:29.220
like all day.
Do you believe in free will?
Right.
That's a good one.

1928
01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:32.760
If my phone is there and it falls,

1929
01:56:32.850 --> 01:56:36.650
there's a reason why it follows the SME tree of the phone,
make it fall.
Maybe I,

1930
01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:41.580
I blew me is a reason I want to say my phone on the fail.
But if you,

1931
01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:46.230
if you do something wrong,
for example,
you kill someone,
you just

1932
01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:49.890
decided like kill someone.

1933
01:56:49.891 --> 01:56:53.160
Like there's a reason why you do something and if you go back,

1934
01:56:53.161 --> 01:56:56.610
the reason there's a reason of,
the reason,
the reason,
it's like,
it's like a dumb,

1935
01:56:56.611 --> 01:57:01.450
you know?
Yup.
Yup.
I'm thinking,
I'm like,
man,
it made me think like,

1936
01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:05.330
I have no choice.
Right.
I gala,
you're world champion or your work for you.
I said,

1937
01:57:05.331 --> 01:57:09.480
yeah,
but I have no choice.
Well,
so I have no,
no.
Uh,

1938
01:57:09.481 --> 01:57:12.000
I don't deserve any props because I had no choice.
Right.

1939
01:57:12.001 --> 01:57:14.220
You are the product of your life experience.
To me.

1940
01:57:14.250 --> 01:57:17.550
That's what makes the most sense for me.
People think I'm crazy,

1941
01:57:17.551 --> 01:57:21.000
but I have an argument with a lot sometimes like a lot of really just people,

1942
01:57:21.001 --> 01:57:25.350
they say,
Oh yeah,
but I,
that's why I believe,

1943
01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:28.890
I believe sometime like,
and it doesn't mean I don't believe in God or I don't,

1944
01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:33.720
it doesn't mean that I am different.
I get my buddy,
but I believe have no choice.

1945
01:57:33.721 --> 01:57:35.010
If I do something,
I have no choice.

1946
01:57:35.160 --> 01:57:38.850
But you do have ethics and you do have morals and you do make decisions.

1947
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:42.730
So that's where it gets slippery.
I don't think I made the decision.
No,
I didn't.

1948
01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:46.560
They,
they,
they,
it was a cause to that decision.

1949
01:57:47.220 --> 01:57:48.240
There was a cost to everything.

1950
01:57:48.241 --> 01:57:52.350
And by definition there is a cause there was no free will.
Well,

1951
01:57:52.351 --> 01:57:54.960
it's a good argument.
I've heard it.
I mean,

1952
01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:59.310
Sam Harris argued it to me the best and made me really reconsider.

1953
01:57:59.340 --> 01:58:02.370
And uh,
Robert Sapolsky,
who was a,
a,

1954
01:58:02.371 --> 01:58:07.371
a famous scientist and deals with a lot of the functions of the human brain in

1955
01:58:08.251 --> 01:58:11.850
terms of like our motivations for things.
He's his take.

1956
01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:14.670
Was that in the future that will be,
you know,

1957
01:58:14.671 --> 01:58:18.780
when we look back today at like people that burn people for witchcraft and stuff

1958
01:58:18.781 --> 01:58:19.980
like that and how foolish they are,

1959
01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:25.280
he thinks we will have the same reaction to people judging and punishing people

1960
01:58:25.411 --> 01:58:28.530
based on their behaviors.
I agree 100% wow.

1961
01:58:28.910 --> 01:58:33.210
The just look go back and time in the back in the,

1962
01:58:33.211 --> 01:58:36.640
I think it's an ancient Greek there that man,

1963
01:58:36.750 --> 01:58:40.170
they were good teaching knowledge to kids in exchange of sexual favor.

1964
01:58:40.171 --> 01:58:43.820
There wasn't,
you know,
it happens.
Yeah.
Now we call it that Pinto Philly.
It's,

1965
01:58:43.821 --> 01:58:48.040
it's a,
it's,
it's wrong.
We put the people in prison,

1966
01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:50.650
but back in the day was normal.
You know what I mean?

1967
01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:56.780
Sometimes our conception of good and bad or,
or choice,
you know,

1968
01:58:57.130 --> 01:59:01.150
I choose like I don't,
I don't know man.
I don't believe there is good and bad.

1969
01:59:01.151 --> 01:59:02.880
I don't believe they choice.
I don't,

1970
01:59:02.890 --> 01:59:06.250
I don't and I have a hard time to believe I choose something.
Well,

1971
01:59:06.251 --> 01:59:10.540
there's certainly things that you,
my finger more positive than negative.
Right?

1972
01:59:10.610 --> 01:59:12.430
Like to my mind,

1973
01:59:12.431 --> 01:59:16.840
to people and friendly to people's more positive than being,
you know a murderer.

1974
01:59:17.800 --> 01:59:21.090
Yeah.
That's how you have a gun.
Let's say you want to kill someone and say,

1975
01:59:21.091 --> 01:59:25.360
Hey George,
can you borrow me a gun please?
As I,
Oh yeah,
I'm nice.

1976
01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:29.080
A nice gesture.
I will give you a gun,
but then you go kill someone.

1977
01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:33.220
So it's my gesture is nice or not nice.
It all good,
bad.

1978
01:59:33.221 --> 01:59:36.090
They'd all they fan of all you see Joe is all their banner values.

1979
01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:38.500
Depends on why you're giving the person the gun.
Right?
Oh Hey,

1980
01:59:38.501 --> 01:59:42.700
this guy raped a little kid.
Give me your gun.
I'm going to go kill him.
So like,

1981
01:59:42.701 --> 01:59:45.260
oh yeah,
I'll go do a good thing and I'll let you borrow my guns.

1982
01:59:45.290 --> 01:59:49.930
You can go kill this bad.
Okay.
Then my argument is,
okay,
you want to go,
you said,

1983
01:59:49.931 --> 01:59:53.590
George,
give me your gun.
I want to go kill this guy.
I said,
okay,

1984
01:59:53.591 --> 01:59:56.050
I go give you that gun.
This guy is Adele fiddler.

1985
01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:59.620
You go kill him as good thing or bad thing to certain proposed would be good.

1986
01:59:59.621 --> 02:00:04.510
So sort of people would be bad.
It depends what's good.
Bad.
Yeah.

1987
02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:09.100
Aside some time and thinking,
I was like,
man,
all of this we,
who knows?

1988
02:00:09.110 --> 02:00:11.420
And I know we don't.
We freaking don't know man.
I know.

1989
02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:14.830
That's the interesting thing about life is that there's a lot of things in life

1990
02:00:14.831 --> 02:00:18.740
that are messy.
There's not,
there's not a simple answer.
Yeah.

1991
02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:23.140
So we have choices.
It is,
it's like a pool game.
Yeah.

1992
02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:26.960
If mathematically I can,
like I,

1993
02:00:26.961 --> 02:00:29.830
I thought at this talk with Faris and Perez,
he's very smart,

1994
02:00:29.831 --> 02:00:33.010
he studied philosophy degree in philosophy.

1995
02:00:34.010 --> 02:00:35.710
It's like fighting,
you fight a guy,

1996
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:38.800
you study a spatter and you know like when you do this,

1997
02:00:38.830 --> 02:00:41.950
you do that when you do this and do that.
So if you do this,

1998
02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:44.170
you think he will do that.

1999
02:00:44.171 --> 02:00:48.510
But maybe you won't because the environment has changed since then.
But you,

2000
02:00:48.511 --> 02:00:52.680
you know,
it's same thing.
So wait,
you play pool.
If I can measure the,
the,

2001
02:00:52.681 --> 02:00:56.770
the strength that I hit,
the ball ricocheted,
uncertain ball.

2002
02:00:56.980 --> 02:00:59.020
If I can measure everything precisely,

2003
02:00:59.230 --> 02:01:02.800
I will know where all the balls are ending up on the table.
You agree with that?

2004
02:01:03.370 --> 02:01:06.670
If I know the all the data of the universe and I boom,

2005
02:01:07.270 --> 02:01:10.930
I can predict do I up with that.
It would be the same thing with you.

2006
02:01:10.931 --> 02:01:14.320
If I know you by heart,
I know your genetic background.

2007
02:01:14.321 --> 02:01:17.110
I know all the data of the university and it's impossible to them.

2008
02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:18.010
If I wouldn't know,

2009
02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:23.520
I will know specifically what would you do exactly right now if I do that,

2010
02:01:23.530 --> 02:01:24.660
you will know.
You know what I mean?

2011
02:01:25.150 --> 02:01:29.610
How you would exactly react or what you about to say to me.
Yeah,
it's impossible.

2012
02:01:29.730 --> 02:01:31.800
So that's why.
That's why I don't believe in it.

2013
02:01:31.890 --> 02:01:34.000
That's why I believe I don't believe in free will.

2014
02:01:34.030 --> 02:01:37.060
I believe it's all it could be measurable if we don't.

2015
02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:39.770
It's impossible to measure.
Right?

2016
02:01:39.771 --> 02:01:44.390
And then when you see people that are doing good things and achieving good

2017
02:01:44.391 --> 02:01:44.721
things,

2018
02:01:44.721 --> 02:01:49.370
it motivates you to do good things and achieve thing and that also changes all

2019
02:01:49.371 --> 02:01:53.660
the people around you and makes them move in a certain direction as well.

2020
02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:57.620
And if you look at certain cultures that are extremely negative and Crime

2021
02:01:57.620 --> 02:02:01.730
Britain and fucked up,
they produce extremely negative crime,
fucked up people.

2022
02:02:02.290 --> 02:02:04.430
It's like there's,
there's all this going on there.

2023
02:02:04.431 --> 02:02:05.930
Is it the fault of those people?

2024
02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:08.960
And that's one of the things that people really criticized and I think rightly

2025
02:02:08.961 --> 02:02:13.670
so about like hardcore right wing people that think everyone should be

2026
02:02:13.671 --> 02:02:15.110
responsible for their own actions.

2027
02:02:15.111 --> 02:02:17.300
I don't care if you grow up at a crime Britain neighborhood,

2028
02:02:17.450 --> 02:02:22.320
you stop doing crime and you be a good person and that's not an easy task.

2029
02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:27.140
That brain has no way to know if a,
if an information is relevant or not.

2030
02:02:27.170 --> 02:02:29.030
If you grew up in the,
in the

2031
02:02:30.770 --> 02:02:34.820
Democrat system with democratic value,
you'll be,
if you're a smart,

2032
02:02:34.821 --> 02:02:36.230
you'd be as smart or Democrat.

2033
02:02:36.231 --> 02:02:40.730
If you grew up in this same but then the Republicans and we will be smarter

2034
02:02:40.731 --> 02:02:42.380
Republican.
However,

2035
02:02:42.381 --> 02:02:45.570
maybe there is things in your environment that would make you switch.
You know,

2036
02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:48.440
we don't eat your dad.
You're like,
fuck him,
I'm going to be a democrat.

2037
02:02:49.150 --> 02:02:53.840
We don't know.
But that your brain has no way.
So sometimes there's a show on TV,

2038
02:02:53.841 --> 02:02:58.750
like evil genius,
the guy a he outcomes.
He's so smart,
but he's a,

2039
02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:03.230
he's a naval [inaudible] that's,
this comes to what we talk about it.

2040
02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:07.370
Good,
bad.
There's no good bad.
There is no,
that's why when I fight,

2041
02:03:07.410 --> 02:03:12.100
I fight the guys like nick,
Nick,
Nick Diaz,
or if I,

2042
02:03:12.101 --> 02:03:13.330
and I swear it's true.
That's sad.

2043
02:03:13.340 --> 02:03:17.060
Drive my car and I see as a problem with the scarman I would stop to help him.

2044
02:03:17.570 --> 02:03:21.380
Yeah.
Give him too,
he was not nice or w w whoever it is,

2045
02:03:21.381 --> 02:03:25.580
I will do it because for me it's,
I don't think,
you know,
it's not that I'm nice.

2046
02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:29.630
Is that the way I think you know that it's who you are.
Yeah,
they are.
Exactly.

2047
02:03:29.631 --> 02:03:32.300
I have no choice to be at like I am.
It is what it is.
You know?

2048
02:03:32.450 --> 02:03:34.280
I've gotten better at that as I've gotten older,

2049
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:38.480
a better at forgiving people and not holding grudges and not being upset at

2050
02:03:38.481 --> 02:03:41.180
people.
And if I see someone that I had a problem with in the past,

2051
02:03:41.181 --> 02:03:44.750
just give him a hug.
You know,
I don't,
I don't care.
Yeah.
I think it's,
it's,
it's,

2052
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:48.680
it's not healthy to carry around grudges and it make you feel good.

2053
02:03:48.681 --> 02:03:52.940
Sometimes it feels real good and it feels real bad to keep that hate and anger

2054
02:03:52.941 --> 02:03:56.080
inside of you.
It festers away and you think of,
well,
if he says this down,

2055
02:03:56.090 --> 02:03:58.970
I'm going to say that.
Fuck him and he shouldn't have done this.
Well,

2056
02:03:58.971 --> 02:04:00.020
I shouldn't have done that.
But yeah,

2057
02:04:00.021 --> 02:04:02.300
but I only did that because he did this and you play,

2058
02:04:02.301 --> 02:04:04.550
you have these little stupid arguments in your head.

2059
02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:09.050
Instead of just saying hi and just being friendly or saying you're sorry or

2060
02:04:09.051 --> 02:04:11.840
saying,
hey man,
I don't,
I don't have a problem with you.
And there was a guy that,

2061
02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:16.100
um,
a few years ago I,
I drove my car on the,

2062
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:19.370
on the street and Montreal.
He's second in the evening.
I say,

2063
02:04:19.371 --> 02:04:22.730
I told the guy coming at me and he asked for you bake for money,

2064
02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:28.700
put down my window.
This guy swears it's true story.

2065
02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:32.900
He's the guy that used to bully me in school.
Well,
I say,

2066
02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:36.290
I don't want to say his name and I say,
Hey,
wait a second,
I parked my name,

2067
02:04:36.410 --> 02:04:39.310
I had parked my car,
parked the car,
go talk to him is,
is it,

2068
02:04:39.311 --> 02:04:42.870
what the hell you doing here man z
and the,

2069
02:04:42.900 --> 02:04:45.450
and he thought that would be angry because then when he see me,

2070
02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:49.400
he saw his record like I shoot like no,
I'm world champion.
You know,
like I,

2071
02:04:49.401 --> 02:04:51.240
I can't beat the beat them up.
You know,

2072
02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:54.060
back in the day was like two years older than me was bigger.

2073
02:04:54.061 --> 02:04:57.890
It was beating me up in the bus.
This guy,
now we see me as I kind of a scare.

2074
02:04:57.900 --> 02:05:00.510
I get out of my car,
you don't know what,
you don't know if he should run or not.

2075
02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:05.180
So I go to MSA and said,
what'd you do hair man?
Zach is like,
you're,

2076
02:05:05.990 --> 02:05:10.170
it's like,
yeah,
I know,
but things doesn't go well for me,
you know?
I'm like,

2077
02:05:11.330 --> 02:05:14.220
I was like,
all right.
As I was like,
man,
you're a tall guy.

2078
02:05:14.221 --> 02:05:15.960
You're good looking and like what you're doing here man.

2079
02:05:15.961 --> 02:05:19.410
It's like I give him what I have left on me.
You know,

2080
02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:23.660
like I don't remember like I got a hundred something or I give him,
I said,

2081
02:05:23.661 --> 02:05:26.730
get Outta here man.
It's,
I get your full of potential is a get outta here man.

2082
02:05:27.210 --> 02:05:30.740
When I was young and when I want it to be like you,
you're a tall guy,
man,
you,

2083
02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:33.720
you,
you're good looking.
It's like full of potential.

2084
02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:39.280
So he take his,
I was like,
no,
no problem at any site.
Thank you George.

2085
02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:42.180
You get out of that and I don't want to hear about him.

2086
02:05:44.430 --> 02:05:46.920
Few,
few weeks,
few months later,

2087
02:05:46.921 --> 02:05:51.190
I go to my grandma's house for having a dinner that my dad say,
you know,

2088
02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:56.190
come to the house a few days ago,
this guy,
I'm like,

2089
02:05:56.191 --> 02:05:58.620
yeah,
I met him.
He said,
yeah,
you said you met him in the street,

2090
02:05:58.621 --> 02:06:02.670
but now he said he came to thank you.
He came,
he wanted to talk to you,

2091
02:06:02.671 --> 02:06:04.800
but I said,
you don't live here and I didn't want to give you a number,

2092
02:06:04.801 --> 02:06:07.240
but he said,
he said,
look.
He said,
Hey George.

2093
02:06:07.241 --> 02:06:11.090
He talked to me and he said something,
he changed my life.
Now I have a job and I,

2094
02:06:11.091 --> 02:06:11.881
and I felt good.

2095
02:06:11.881 --> 02:06:16.881
I just wanted to say thank you to him and it feels so good now you,

2096
02:06:17.161 --> 02:06:21.000
Justin went and when I met him and I didn't get angry at him,
Jack,
you know,

2097
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:24.360
because it's,
it was still there.
We did very bad stuff to me when I was young.

2098
02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:27.450
But when I see him,
it made me feel good.
Kind of a relief now.

2099
02:06:28.230 --> 02:06:32.160
And this guy,
when I was young,
it was beating me up in the bus all the time.

2100
02:06:32.161 --> 02:06:35.280
It was [inaudible] radicalize me.
I'd like,
I did that Spence,

2101
02:06:35.281 --> 02:06:38.580
that you can tie it like this.
It was like taking off.

2102
02:06:38.581 --> 02:06:41.520
And so I was that Guy Nando where in front of everybody in front of the girl,

2103
02:06:41.521 --> 02:06:44.130
he was beating me up all the time and it was stronger than me,

2104
02:06:44.140 --> 02:06:48.150
was like trees four years older than me and he was tall and strong guy.

2105
02:06:48.151 --> 02:06:50.770
He's a hockey player back in the day and now we,

2106
02:06:50.830 --> 02:06:55.380
I couldn't beat him even when Marshall,
it was always stronger than me.

2107
02:06:55.650 --> 02:07:00.360
He hurt me a lot,
like back in another year.
So my dad,

2108
02:07:00.361 --> 02:07:02.070
one time I was getting beat up in the bus.

2109
02:07:02.071 --> 02:07:05.130
I told him because I came back with a black eye one time in my life,

2110
02:07:05.131 --> 02:07:09.420
I told my dad what happened.
I never said anything by something that Dad said,

2111
02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:12.570
yeah,
he's a guy in a bus.
He beat me up and said,
I tell him the name of the guy.

2112
02:07:12.990 --> 02:07:17.850
So my dad went,
you did,
you found out where?

2113
02:07:18.210 --> 02:07:22.800
I'm from countryside.
So everybody knows who everybody lives.
He goes to Dallas,

2114
02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:26.820
you know,
I could tell it,
talk to Daddy,
say listen and stop it.

2115
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:30.840
Can you tell your son to stop hitting my son in the bus because he need to be

2116
02:07:30.841 --> 02:07:34.950
focused on the school and the dad.
When my dad came back,
he said,
hey,

2117
02:07:34.951 --> 02:07:36.760
I to talk to his dad,
he's going to stop.

2118
02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:41.320
So he said is that it was like drinking and stuff and it was beating the shit

2119
02:07:41.321 --> 02:07:43.600
out of his son.
So the way

2120
02:07:45.100 --> 02:07:49.990
this guy learn to communicate to his dad was beating up.

2121
02:07:50.430 --> 02:07:54.640
He was drunk and beating him up.
That's the way he come.
He was coming in,

2122
02:07:54.670 --> 02:07:55.930
communicating with me.

2123
02:07:56.830 --> 02:08:00.880
It was beating me up because he learned that the same way from is that to

2124
02:08:00.881 --> 02:08:05.350
communicate.
So I was just happened to be at the right,

2125
02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:08.980
right,
the wrong time at the right time in his life at the perfect,
you know,

2126
02:08:08.981 --> 02:08:12.580
I was the guy that was getting beat.
So we say good and bad.

2127
02:08:13.090 --> 02:08:18.090
He wasn't not a bad person to my version of life too,

2128
02:08:18.581 --> 02:08:22.750
for my perspective.
It was a terrible person like them.
It was terrible.

2129
02:08:22.751 --> 02:08:27.640
I wanted to kill him like many May,
may I and my school time miserable man,

2130
02:08:27.641 --> 02:08:30.640
I was a mediated all the time.
I was getting beat up and I had,

2131
02:08:30.700 --> 02:08:32.770
I was very proud person.

2132
02:08:33.070 --> 02:08:37.870
So I used to go fight him all the time because I was proud and I want point.

2133
02:08:37.871 --> 02:08:39.840
I fought him so many times.
You say,
I like this guy,
he's completely,

2134
02:08:39.870 --> 02:08:43.240
and I stop buttering him because I was never going to giving up,

2135
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:46.990
even though it was beating,
getting beat up all that time went to my own eyes.

2136
02:08:46.991 --> 02:08:50.770
It was a bad person,
but true.
His eyes.
It was a different star.

2137
02:08:50.771 --> 02:08:54.680
Ran to his father was a different story to the everybody.

2138
02:08:54.681 --> 02:08:55.780
It was a different story.

2139
02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:59.350
It just to say that when I met him that what did we talk about?

2140
02:08:59.450 --> 02:09:03.610
Like it feels so good just to meet him in the street and make kind of a piece

2141
02:09:03.611 --> 02:09:06.460
and give him money.
Like,
yeah,
you beat me up,
you didn't.

2142
02:09:06.670 --> 02:09:08.290
But you know why even though you did that,

2143
02:09:08.950 --> 02:09:13.950
I give you the money and I make me feel like I'm kind of a revenge better than

2144
02:09:14.741 --> 02:09:16.560
their revenge in making me feel like,
yeah man,

2145
02:09:16.580 --> 02:09:21.580
you see without me you wouldn't have nothing maybe to sleep or eat tonight is I

2146
02:09:21.641 --> 02:09:24.130
give it to you.
I still give it to you if you do that to me,

2147
02:09:24.670 --> 02:09:28.810
that make me feel much better than if I would like be read them up.

2148
02:09:29.530 --> 02:09:33.700
And don't you think that maybe that guy and him doing that to was one of the

2149
02:09:33.701 --> 02:09:38.170
reasons why you became a champion
because you,

2150
02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:41.770
you got into martial arts very heavily because of being dad because I was

2151
02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:44.080
beating up and the school.
Maybe it was,

2152
02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:47.470
but he was not the only guy that was beating me up all his friend.

2153
02:09:47.471 --> 02:09:48.640
But he was kind of the,

2154
02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:53.800
the guy that was all their girl liked and he was like the taller or stronger

2155
02:09:53.801 --> 02:09:56.620
guys.
So he was kind of the Alpha guy at the time.

2156
02:09:58.240 --> 02:10:01.810
Maybe it was an effort.
Like I said,
I don't believe only one thing influenced me.

2157
02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:06.760
It's many things,
many cars that make that happen,

2158
02:10:06.761 --> 02:10:10.780
but maybe it's one of the calls.
Yes.
Yeah.
It was crazy.
I could be wrong.

2159
02:10:10.781 --> 02:10:14.650
I could be right,
but that's why.
That's my philosophy in life.
That's how I think.

2160
02:10:14.770 --> 02:10:16.240
So everybody,
I says,
oh George,

2161
02:10:16.250 --> 02:10:19.800
you're a true martial artists who are a good guy as I thank you.

2162
02:10:19.930 --> 02:10:23.770
I don't have the time to explain to them everything I just told you.
Right,
right,

2163
02:10:23.780 --> 02:10:26.650
right.
But that's how I think.
And might one day and say,
you're a good guy.
I was,

2164
02:10:26.651 --> 02:10:31.030
I am.
Thank you.
I'm not a fucking good guy,
man.
I'm me.

2165
02:10:31.031 --> 02:10:34.640
I myself,
I am die.
But it made me happy.

2166
02:10:34.641 --> 02:10:38.450
When people say that or a good guy and you try to be a good guy.
I tried to be,

2167
02:10:38.451 --> 02:10:43.400
but you are who you are.
I try.
I tried to be good model.

2168
02:10:43.401 --> 02:10:47.750
A good role model I think is important for me to my value that had been raised,

2169
02:10:47.751 --> 02:10:52.520
you know,
but doesn't mean like I don't like other guys.

2170
02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:56.030
I like the guys that I liked the most to,
to,
to watch their fight.

2171
02:10:56.031 --> 02:11:00.050
They're another good guy.
My favorite fighters to watch are not the good guys.

2172
02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:04.970
You Sauna and I like to watch him.
Nick Z eyes.

2173
02:11:04.971 --> 02:11:09.320
I like to watch Nick Diaz.
I like Conor McGregor when he fights.
I like him.
Yeah,

2174
02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:13.460
they're good.
Guys are boring man.
They boring guys.
You're making me fall asleep.

2175
02:11:13.461 --> 02:11:18.230
I like the drummer.
I like even though I don't act like it.
I like it.
We won't be.

2176
02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:23.480
I know it's completely contradictory.
I like,
I love the Tito Ortiz.

2177
02:11:23.481 --> 02:11:28.010
Back in the day was my favorite man.
Story.
T's man.
He was amazing.

2178
02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:31.880
Came with his flag like bad,
bad guy and I loved it.
Man.

2179
02:11:33.110 --> 02:11:37.710
Star Wars.
I love their sin,
Lord much.
They're much more charismatic than the jet.

2180
02:11:37.711 --> 02:11:42.470
I are you shitting me,
Jed?
I [inaudible] the new,
the new karate kid.

2181
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:46.220
I watched the first episode of moping Daniel's son get beat up all the time.

2182
02:11:46.221 --> 02:11:50.300
You know,
Johnny Lorenz,
I hope he smashes his head that you didn't do it.

2183
02:11:51.230 --> 02:11:56.030
So,
you know what I mean?
That make me a bad person.
No,
it's just,

2184
02:11:56.031 --> 02:11:59.420
I like,
you know,
it's different the way that's how you see things,
you know?
Right.

2185
02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:02.510
When you see a lion chasing the gazelle,
do you root for the gazelle?

2186
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:07.620
I hope the light catches it gives.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Is that good or bad?

2187
02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:10.980
Like if people and only eat meat,
there's nothing natural.
Right?

2188
02:12:11.250 --> 02:12:13.610
It's like what is natural?
What isn't that natural man?

2189
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:16.990
It's an interesting conversation when you talk about this.
If people think God,

2190
02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.790
your savior is just so you just get hit and they had to do too many times,

2191
02:12:19.791 --> 02:12:24.410
but it's just,
it's just not now.
My,
my English is good.
I can communicate it.

2192
02:12:24.450 --> 02:12:28.840
True truth with you like,
yeah.
Like it's easier,
I feel more call affordable.
Yeah.

2193
02:12:28.990 --> 02:12:30.930
And,
and it,
it is what it is.
But I I,

2194
02:12:30.940 --> 02:12:33.440
that's why I like it because you're a person too.

2195
02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:36.830
I'm kind of a big fan of youtube and I know you,

2196
02:12:37.250 --> 02:12:39.500
I didn't know that in the beginning when I first to know you,

2197
02:12:39.501 --> 02:12:40.640
but I now I know that,

2198
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:46.340
that you get interested in the same thing that I am interested and what I like

2199
02:12:46.341 --> 02:12:50.180
about usual is you don't give a damn.
You do whatever.
You have no bus,

2200
02:12:50.181 --> 02:12:53.890
you do whatever you want whenever you want.
We who you won't.
And me,

2201
02:12:53.891 --> 02:12:55.820
I'd respect that.
It's kind of a code.

2202
02:12:55.970 --> 02:12:58.850
You have your own code that you do and I respect that.

2203
02:12:59.150 --> 02:13:02.180
I like human being like this.
I like to,
to be

2204
02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:06.920
with human being like this guys,
I have no code and we're like this.

2205
02:13:07.930 --> 02:13:11.470
Me and my circle of friend is shortening and I have a few guy,
I like him.
I said,

2206
02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:15.260
I keep the,
the,
the,
the,
I'm diplomatic with a lot of people,

2207
02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:20.150
but I'm not friends with a lot of people and some blue Maddie because have to be

2208
02:13:20.151 --> 02:13:23.060
for the,
for my work,
for my business,
for the person I am,

2209
02:13:23.061 --> 02:13:25.820
and I don't like golf rotations.
I'm diplomatic,
but there's a mean.

2210
02:13:25.821 --> 02:13:27.380
I like everybody,
you know.
Well,

2211
02:13:27.381 --> 02:13:29.360
I think your relationships that you have with people,

2212
02:13:29.630 --> 02:13:31.260
the exchanges you have with people,

2213
02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:36.060
it's very important to keep only positive,
influential,

2214
02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:40.290
strong people around you because you learn and you grow from those people and

2215
02:13:40.470 --> 02:13:44.130
they give you fuel when you're around people who are inspirational or doing

2216
02:13:44.131 --> 02:13:47.940
interesting things,
who live their life by a code,
who are ambitious,

2217
02:13:48.060 --> 02:13:51.000
who succeeded,
who try hard,
difficult things,

2218
02:13:51.450 --> 02:13:54.210
those are the people that had spire and give you energy.

2219
02:13:54.210 --> 02:13:56.280
And I feel better around them.

2220
02:13:56.281 --> 02:14:00.660
I feel like I get energy from them versus people that are always making excuses

2221
02:14:00.661 --> 02:14:02.370
and people that are always falling short.

2222
02:14:02.490 --> 02:14:05.820
People that fail all the time and people that complain all the time,

2223
02:14:05.970 --> 02:14:07.680
those people are the opposite.
And those people,

2224
02:14:07.681 --> 02:14:10.890
they take away from you and you're around them.
You just like,
oh,

2225
02:14:10.891 --> 02:14:13.350
I just got to get away from this guy.
I however,

2226
02:14:13.351 --> 02:14:17.910
it doesn't mean that the good people that you have in your life will always be

2227
02:14:17.911 --> 02:14:20.790
the good people for different situation.
Example,

2228
02:14:21.330 --> 02:14:24.090
before I fight my families,

2229
02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:29.990
I stayed the hell away from them and I explain it to wire cause my family,

2230
02:14:30.391 --> 02:14:33.180
they care about me.
I remember before fights,

2231
02:14:33.181 --> 02:14:36.360
before I used to go eat at my and my parent with my parent,
my family,

2232
02:14:36.930 --> 02:14:40.980
it used to be like the last dinner.
They,
they,
they,
they,
they,
there are soup.

2233
02:14:41.010 --> 02:14:45.550
They look at me,
are you okay?
You feel good,
you're not sick ag.

2234
02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:49.290
And um,
and I,
before I fight,

2235
02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:53.640
I need to feel like I'm going to war with my soldier Allie to fill that what I'm

2236
02:14:53.641 --> 02:14:57.350
doing,
it's normal events though,
is not,
so when I hang out with,

2237
02:14:57.940 --> 02:15:02.160
with my family,
they have a normal life.
So what I do,
they see me like an outcast.

2238
02:15:02.161 --> 02:15:04.200
I collect man.
He's the guy he's is,
he's completely insane.

2239
02:15:04.201 --> 02:15:06.780
He's about to go fight.
And the gauge,
you can die.
Oh my God.

2240
02:15:07.110 --> 02:15:11.580
And I feel that because I love me.
So my family before the fight,

2241
02:15:11.710 --> 02:15:12.840
stay away from them.

2242
02:15:12.841 --> 02:15:16.200
I stay away from a lot of the people that I love that are in my circle of

2243
02:15:16.201 --> 02:15:19.050
friends or,
or real people.
I love it like family.

2244
02:15:19.770 --> 02:15:23.810
And I bring back closer to people like,
like Feras Joan,

2245
02:15:23.811 --> 02:15:25.410
and they had a fighter's guys,

2246
02:15:25.411 --> 02:15:27.600
even guys that are maybe not as much as my friend a day.

2247
02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:30.840
Like she don't understand the mentality.
Yes.

2248
02:15:31.110 --> 02:15:35.760
So it make me feel normally make me feel strong because we're going to war.

2249
02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:40.110
When you're going to war,
you don't bring in.
Yeah.
Why?
If you're a kid,

2250
02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:44.490
your family,
uh,
you bring the people that you go into war with.

2251
02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:47.190
You know what I mean?
It's very important for me.
So it's,

2252
02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:50.700
it's depending what's going on.

2253
02:15:50.701 --> 02:15:54.420
I believe it's good and bad people,
you know,
it's not always good.
Not always bad,

2254
02:15:54.421 --> 02:15:57.600
depending on the context,
you know?
Yeah,
no,
that makes a lot of sense.

2255
02:15:57.690 --> 02:16:01.470
That makes a lot of sense.
Especially them being nervous about your fight.

2256
02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:06.150
Like big nerve that that energy is contagious pro.
I'm already nervous like,

2257
02:16:06.180 --> 02:16:10.260
like it is.
I don't want to be more nervous and I hate,

2258
02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:14.700
I hate like I hate to fighting people's,
I know you had Donald is,

2259
02:16:14.701 --> 02:16:18.390
I really do and I know you're maybe a lot of people don't,

2260
02:16:18.430 --> 02:16:22.110
don't believe me,
but I'm going to try to explain the best I can

2261
02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:28.110
in every,
in every jobs there is no perfect job.
Do we agree that there is,

2262
02:16:28.111 --> 02:16:32.680
there's no job that you like everything about it.

2263
02:16:33.850 --> 02:16:34.750
It's impossible.

2264
02:16:35.830 --> 02:16:40.830
My job as a professional athlete and mixed martial art untree Android's 65 days.

2265
02:16:42.410 --> 02:16:44.300
I F I fight when I was very excited.

2266
02:16:44.310 --> 02:16:48.100
I used to fight twice a year approximately that much more than that.

2267
02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:50.800
I never wanted it to more than that'd be good.
I want it to stretch suspicion,

2268
02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:54.880
winery sh you want to stretch when you're a champion because it's better for for

2269
02:16:54.960 --> 02:16:59.320
advertising.
The,
the also for longevity and everything.

2270
02:16:59.350 --> 02:17:02.980
So we more time,
more money,
more business wise on everything and longevity.

2271
02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:07.840
So about twice a year in trudge at 65 days.

2272
02:17:07.930 --> 02:17:11.440
There's two days that I hate the most is that day that I'm fighting.

2273
02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:13.690
It's freaking unbearable.

2274
02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:17.410
The feeling event certainty that if you don't know,

2275
02:17:17.411 --> 02:17:20.020
if you're going to be humiliated,
you're going to be the victor.

2276
02:17:20.020 --> 02:17:22.420
We are going to be the loser.
It's,

2277
02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:25.260
I care so much about it that he is freaking I'm bare boat.

2278
02:17:25.261 --> 02:17:29.650
As much as I tried to dismiss it,
it's unbearable.

2279
02:17:30.430 --> 02:17:33.610
However,
I liked the fact that I'm a free man.
I'm my own bus.

2280
02:17:33.611 --> 02:17:35.740
I do whatever it ever read over Av,

2281
02:17:35.800 --> 02:17:39.280
AV access to certain things like VIP stuff that most people don't.

2282
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:44.790
And my quality of life,
uh,
the money,
I didn't have it before.

2283
02:17:44.810 --> 02:17:49.120
Now I do.
I love my job,
am very happy about my job,

2284
02:17:49.330 --> 02:17:53.890
but there is thing about my job that I hate.
Demos is fighting.

2285
02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:58.900
I freaking hate.
I love the study of fighting.
I love the science of it.

2286
02:17:58.901 --> 02:18:01.750
How,
um,
the tactical,
the physical.
I love to train.

2287
02:18:01.751 --> 02:18:04.900
I love to walk in a room for the strong.
I know if something happened,

2288
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:05.870
I'm the demand.

2289
02:18:05.890 --> 02:18:09.010
Even though it's an illusion because it with a bullet and nobody's faster than

2290
02:18:09.011 --> 02:18:13.330
this,
but I liked that lifestyle.

2291
02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:17.980
I do it for the lifestyle,
for what it is.
I don't do it for the fight.

2292
02:18:17.981 --> 02:18:20.890
I freaking hate to fight.
I had this talk with Robert McDonald wound boy,

2293
02:18:20.891 --> 02:18:24.010
and I was like,
hey,
why are you like fighting?
Oh,
I guess I like to fight.
He said,

2294
02:18:24.011 --> 02:18:26.280
you'd like to fight.
Is that you?
Fuck now I know,
and I,

2295
02:18:26.940 --> 02:18:30.130
and everybody in that room turn around.
They look at me like I'm crazy.
I'm like,

2296
02:18:30.370 --> 02:18:31.990
you guys are all crazy.

2297
02:18:32.140 --> 02:18:35.170
They got active fight the nic cage and 1 million of people maybe getting

2298
02:18:35.171 --> 02:18:40.150
mediated,
knocked out or die.
Are you crazy?
I don't like to fight.
I,
you're nuts.

2299
02:18:41.590 --> 02:18:45.850
I like to win.
When you win,
you're,
it's,
the feeling is unbelievable.

2300
02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:49.510
It's so good that it's worth this,

2301
02:18:51.070 --> 02:18:53.080
but I hate it,
man.

2302
02:18:53.081 --> 02:18:57.070
Do you hate the day of the fight up until the fight,

2303
02:18:57.100 --> 02:19:02.040
but once the fight starts,
how do you feel once it starts then and then,

2304
02:19:02.041 --> 02:19:05.440
no,
no,
and when it started,
it's gone.
I'll listen to all the anticipation.

2305
02:19:05.690 --> 02:19:08.950
I hate the day the buildup that they,

2306
02:19:09.680 --> 02:19:13.540
and the closer we get to the day I start,
I love it,

2307
02:19:13.541 --> 02:19:15.430
but I start to hate it more.

2308
02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:18.460
It's like a build ahead that build up like a bubble of hate.

2309
02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:24.160
And by that time that it's time to freak and walk out there like the

2310
02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:30.550
many second.
That is time to walk out.
And I burnt.

2311
02:19:30.551 --> 02:19:32.680
Watson used to be the guy used to kick out the door.

2312
02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:34.390
<v 3>Sorry.
Yeah,
you ready?</v>

2313
02:19:35.250 --> 02:19:37.170
<v 0>Now he's not there anymore,
unfortunately</v>

2314
02:19:39.780 --> 02:19:40.810
<v 3>Colin Bro.</v>

2315
02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:45.920
<v 0>So I used,</v>

2316
02:19:46.100 --> 02:19:49.980
it's like a bubble that build up in my stomach that hate,
hate,
hate.

2317
02:19:49.981 --> 02:19:53.030
Then I freaking hate that I'm even in the locker room before the fight and I

2318
02:19:53.031 --> 02:19:56.990
fucking hated my last fight.
I,
it's crazy.

2319
02:19:57.410 --> 02:20:01.850
I saw my friend,
Amen.
Gag knocked out and I'm glad the dinner,

2320
02:20:02.060 --> 02:20:05.410
everybody's like dead people like this and,
and has,

2321
02:20:05.420 --> 02:20:07.880
she wears something as long as they were just wrong.
And he's like,

2322
02:20:07.970 --> 02:20:11.510
they told themselves before I get into the room,
we don't tell them that,

2323
02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:14.270
that amen last.
Don't tell him he's just going to affect him.

2324
02:20:15.050 --> 02:20:18.940
So I get into their room and my friend Eddie,
who was in there one day,

2325
02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:22.970
when they tell each other,
first thing he says to me is,
I get numbers I amen.

2326
02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:26.540
Loss.
Oh,
he's okay physically is that?
Yeah,
is okay.
And everybody's like,
Whoa,

2327
02:20:26.541 --> 02:20:30.270
what are you shit.
So Emma last,
I remember Joe de Filez,

2328
02:20:30.900 --> 02:20:33.860
Micky gall loss.
So I go in my room in my locker room,

2329
02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:35.750
I see one guy with the ice bag,

2330
02:20:35.751 --> 02:20:38.810
the other guy is all fucked up like this and I'm like,
man,

2331
02:20:38.811 --> 02:20:42.140
all my locker room lose man.
Oh Holy Shit.

2332
02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:44.360
I freaking hate this job,
man.

2333
02:20:45.290 --> 02:20:48.790
Then I'm thinking is like everybody tried to make me take like,
oh,

2334
02:20:48.791 --> 02:20:53.000
he's going to be good is one of my agents like tone where everybody is going to

2335
02:20:53.001 --> 02:20:57.370
be fine as I as I,
it's okay man.
Don't talk to me like this.
I choose be here,
I'm,

2336
02:20:57.380 --> 02:21:01.040
I'm a warrior and a,
it's a goal.
Go sit now.
It's going to be fine.

2337
02:21:01.041 --> 02:21:04.120
Like I want it to be a warrior.
I don't want to be that high.

2338
02:21:04.300 --> 02:21:08.950
It's going to be fine.
Don't worry.
You know,
they go negative.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2339
02:21:10.030 --> 02:21:14.870
He was that first time they go like this guy,
they grabbed me like dory,
dory,

2340
02:21:14.880 --> 02:21:18.800
it's gotta be fine and it'll keep charter.
Is Heidi by a news Islam?

2341
02:21:18.801 --> 02:21:23.120
Everybody on the,
on his head all these years.
Um,
I'm feeling like I'm going to,

2342
02:21:23.130 --> 02:21:28.130
uh,
I guess are like a cemetery.
Like someone just died.
So I'm in the locker room.

2343
02:21:28.131 --> 02:21:32.690
Everybody,
if we can lose,
I'm like,
Damn.
Then I'm like,
yeah,
you shake it up.

2344
02:21:32.720 --> 02:21:34.460
I go in the bathroom by myself.
I go,

2345
02:21:34.461 --> 02:21:36.650
I go look myself in the mirror and that's why I do.

2346
02:21:36.651 --> 02:21:41.480
Before the fight I used James Lounge theory.
James.

2347
02:21:41.481 --> 02:21:46.300
Now James is a,
they say that the spirit can dictate your mind is a you,

2348
02:21:46.301 --> 02:21:48.380
you're thirsty,
you're mind tells I'm thirsty.

2349
02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:51.710
You grabbed the water and your spirit can dictate your mind,

2350
02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:56.000
but your mind can dictate your spirit.
So I go in the bathroom,
close the door.

2351
02:21:56.250 --> 02:21:58.970
People would think I go to bedroom to piss or whatever,
but I don't,

2352
02:21:59.300 --> 02:22:02.660
it goes to the door and I say,
I say,
now I see a lot of negative shit.
I go,

2353
02:22:02.661 --> 02:22:05.980
I go in front of the mirror and say,
I say to my son,
I say,
I say,

2354
02:22:06.110 --> 02:22:10.760
I tried to convince myself like a kid.
You know,
like I'm the greatest.

2355
02:22:10.761 --> 02:22:14.480
I'm the stronger as I know.
And I think,
I think I would look at me and I'm this,

2356
02:22:14.481 --> 02:22:18.860
I'm beautiful,
I'm stone and this,
I know I'm faster,
I'm stronger.

2357
02:22:18.861 --> 02:22:21.350
I'm getting a win as like these young guy they lose.

2358
02:22:21.351 --> 02:22:24.450
But I'm going to show them what the w the way to do it,
you know?

2359
02:22:24.451 --> 02:22:26.250
And maybe they fell,
but I won't.

2360
02:22:26.251 --> 02:22:30.660
I'm going to show everybody always should be done,
man.
So I come back in the gym,

2361
02:22:30.690 --> 02:22:32.120
go with the,

2362
02:22:32.130 --> 02:22:35.790
with the glory to show them that I achieve it and that's how it should be done

2363
02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:40.590
if they're going to follow me.
So I try boobs,
my eyes then open that are go,

2364
02:22:40.830 --> 02:22:42.690
go back.
I still hate my job,

2365
02:22:42.691 --> 02:22:45.030
but I am a different person than when I got in the door.

2366
02:22:45.780 --> 02:22:49.410
So I play with mind games like this with myself all the time.

2367
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:54.830
It's stuff that I had tried to change your attitude and it's very important for

2368
02:22:54.841 --> 02:22:59.400
our fighter because the confidence is a key for a fighter.
Some guy,

2369
02:22:59.401 --> 02:23:03.510
they do stuff very basic and a I,
but they do it.
When they do it.

2370
02:23:03.511 --> 02:23:05.610
They do it so good.
Then they believe in it.

2371
02:23:05.730 --> 02:23:08.550
They're not hesitate and you have no room for visitation and a fight.

2372
02:23:08.551 --> 02:23:12.360
You go 100% and when you go 100% with confidence,

2373
02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:16.590
that's when the magic can happen.
You know what I mean?
If you have there the tat,

2374
02:23:16.610 --> 02:23:17.520
the skills,

2375
02:23:18.540 --> 02:23:22.510
but you don't have the confidence is in is John says that that you have the

2376
02:23:22.511 --> 02:23:24.390
skills and they have no confidence.

2377
02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:28.890
It's like having money when you don't spend it.
That's what John and Eric on me.

2378
02:23:29.380 --> 02:23:33.420
But if you have the confidence without the skills,
it's not good to,

2379
02:23:33.421 --> 02:23:36.840
it's like a dream that cannot be achieved.
You don't have the any way together,

2380
02:23:36.841 --> 02:23:40.500
but you have boat.
That's when the magic can happen.
I remember when John,
John,

2381
02:23:40.501 --> 02:23:41.640
he says that to me all the time,

2382
02:23:41.940 --> 02:23:46.050
so you have the skill and you have the confidence and confidence is not a choice

2383
02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:49.900
is that is it a confidence isn't that is not a state of mind is a choice and

2384
02:23:49.901 --> 02:23:53.780
then you can build it in your head when something bad happened,

2385
02:23:53.781 --> 02:23:56.970
you build it and work,
tried to work on your person to build it.

2386
02:23:56.971 --> 02:23:59.160
This is something you can work on yourself,
you know,

2387
02:23:59.250 --> 02:24:01.830
and that's why I've been doing,
yeah,

2388
02:24:01.950 --> 02:24:04.970
it's like all these other things you're saying it's,
there's no,

2389
02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.770
there's no one answer to how all of this is done.

2390
02:24:07.770 --> 02:24:09.510
All of those pieces have to come together.

2391
02:24:09.720 --> 02:24:13.200
All those pieces have to be together in order for you to be able to just go out

2392
02:24:13.201 --> 02:24:16.170
there and do it.
But I love the fact that you say that you don't like it.

2393
02:24:16.350 --> 02:24:18.210
I freaking hate it.
I hate it.

2394
02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:20.910
Probably even in their locker room when I got there,

2395
02:24:20.970 --> 02:24:25.460
what I've got there that night and like every other night that I'm finding as by

2396
02:24:25.470 --> 02:24:29.520
my agent ask to ask.
Even for Assa.
I always tell them,
I look at him as like,

2397
02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:34.100
so what the hell I'm doing here or whatnot.
I got so stupid as you're like,

2398
02:24:34.170 --> 02:24:35.040
oh my God,

2399
02:24:35.530 --> 02:24:40.530
and they always laugh at it because now it becomes at that point that I know,

2400
02:24:41.370 --> 02:24:42.203
I know it.

2401
02:24:42.660 --> 02:24:47.010
People say with experience or you do become more courageous,
do you become,

2402
02:24:47.740 --> 02:24:51.540
how do you say,
do you lose the fair?
You don't lose every,
never lose a fair.

2403
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:56.220
You will learn how to deal with it.
You accept it.
Before I didn't,

2404
02:24:56.221 --> 02:24:59.760
I didn't get accepted in my earlier fight like Matthew was.

2405
02:24:59.761 --> 02:25:03.630
My first time I found my [inaudible] man,
I was fighting this monument.
They say,

2406
02:25:03.631 --> 02:25:08.010
oh my God.
I was like,
I didn't city for the week,
man.
I came like Africans Zombie.

2407
02:25:08.011 --> 02:25:11.010
I was like,
oh my God,
I can't even in this third down,

2408
02:25:11.011 --> 02:25:13.020
I couldn't even look at him.
I look up like this.

2409
02:25:13.080 --> 02:25:18.060
It's like I couldn't imagine myself as I knew I was going to lose the
confidence,

2410
02:25:18.061 --> 02:25:22.590
wasn't it?
There have the skip was another confidence,
so it's is very important.

2411
02:25:22.591 --> 02:25:26.590
The confidence know is for a fighter.
Confidence is very important.

2412
02:25:26.950 --> 02:25:29.230
That's why you have guys in the gym that are very good in the gym.

2413
02:25:29.231 --> 02:25:32.920
They get into a fight,
they shitty fighter.
They came in the gym,

2414
02:25:32.921 --> 02:25:36.970
they go into a fight,
all of that stuff.
Garage,

2415
02:25:37.500 --> 02:25:42.460
you have guys,
they're normal in the gym.
I've seen guys in UFC day fight the UFC.

2416
02:25:42.461 --> 02:25:45.550
Dave frigging bad.
I can't say for their respect,

2417
02:25:45.551 --> 02:25:49.750
but I spar with them and they suck.
When they fight,

2418
02:25:50.050 --> 02:25:53.590
they do stuff that it's amazing.
I'm like,
I didn't even know it.

2419
02:25:53.620 --> 02:25:58.360
That wasn't his repertoire of techniques.
They just did it.
I'm like,

2420
02:25:58.361 --> 02:26:03.340
man,
it's amazing.
I didn't even know he knew that because of confidence,

2421
02:26:03.341 --> 02:26:05.260
man.
And when you have bowed this,

2422
02:26:05.261 --> 02:26:08.890
get into confidence and I you see like John Jones,
man,
his magic man,

2423
02:26:08.891 --> 02:26:12.670
you go with there and pop,
pop,
pop as spinning,
frigging elbows and supply.

2424
02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:16.300
You don't hesitate.
He goes,
man,
you're Rodriguez.
He's amazing.

2425
02:26:16.650 --> 02:26:19.870
Ban and stuff like that.
It's just beautiful to watch.
You know,

2426
02:26:19.871 --> 02:26:23.770
and I really liked that.
The new generation man is carriers.
Oh my God,

2427
02:26:24.820 --> 02:26:28.910
what?
X,
which fight excites you more,
Connor?
Or it could be,

2428
02:26:28.911 --> 02:26:31.690
but those are the two fights.
If I was going to make a fight for your right,

2429
02:26:31.691 --> 02:26:35.900
right,
right now,
right now it's like the big five.
The thing is with Kbb,

2430
02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:40.920
calling me out physically now is not good time for me and he and neat the way a

2431
02:26:41.921 --> 02:26:42.754
little bit.

2432
02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:48.120
However I feel that one 55 division now is scanner is the champion is forgive

2433
02:26:49.171 --> 02:26:52.480
somebody.
I think Ferguson is out and,
and there's other guys too,

2434
02:26:53.140 --> 02:26:55.150
but there's the two guy,
Carter and cabby

2435
02:26:56.800 --> 02:26:58.720
cabby now I think he's that trap you in,

2436
02:26:58.721 --> 02:27:03.721
but the need to fight maybe the corner or are are to be like a champion.

2437
02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:06.311
He's the real chart.

2438
02:27:06.311 --> 02:27:11.020
I don't like to say they really not champion and my opinion on the belt is

2439
02:27:11.021 --> 02:27:12.520
really different than most people think.

2440
02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:14.260
I don't think even think you should be at belt.
You know?

2441
02:27:14.261 --> 02:27:18.850
I think it should be fight,
you know by then,
but it is what it is and make fun.

2442
02:27:18.851 --> 02:27:23.380
Fight.
There's no belt is you cannot be the strongest men in the world is I need

2443
02:27:23.381 --> 02:27:24.214
illusion.

2444
02:27:24.550 --> 02:27:28.600
The belt it claim it elevates on one like you think he's a god.

2445
02:27:28.601 --> 02:27:31.480
He's a strongest today and men and in that now he's not.

2446
02:27:31.510 --> 02:27:35.590
What's a good marketing tool that that rank guide that can beat you,

2447
02:27:35.591 --> 02:27:39.100
but maybe you cannot be the seven other in front of you or they say,

2448
02:27:39.220 --> 02:27:43.960
you know what I mean?
There's six either,
so I don't know how he could be done.

2449
02:27:43.961 --> 02:27:48.790
I know it's bad to criticize a system if you don't suggest any alternative.

2450
02:27:48.791 --> 02:27:52.090
I know it's better with I do,
but it's,
well,

2451
02:27:52.091 --> 02:27:54.250
the problem is in flux anyway,
right?

2452
02:27:54.250 --> 02:27:57.790
Because Tony was the interim champion and he didn't do anything to lose it.

2453
02:27:57.820 --> 02:28:01.630
All we do is fall down while doing press obligations is terrorists,
Nia part.

2454
02:28:01.930 --> 02:28:06.010
Then you have Connor who just didn't defend it and then they stripped him and so

2455
02:28:06.011 --> 02:28:09.280
you're going to give it to Khabib,

2456
02:28:09.310 --> 02:28:13.900
but he's fighting our Quinta who ordinarily wouldn't be fighting for the title.

2457
02:28:13.901 --> 02:28:17.530
So why is,
why is he have the potential to fight for the title?

2458
02:28:17.531 --> 02:28:18.430
It doesn't make any sense.

2459
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:22.040
They just had to do it for this event because they had this big event in

2460
02:28:22.041 --> 02:28:25.130
Brooklyn and they had to have a champion,
so they decided to sell.

2461
02:28:25.131 --> 02:28:25.964
They're going to do it.

2462
02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:29.730
But you gotta be careful when you make decisions like that.
Yeah.

2463
02:28:29.780 --> 02:28:33.230
Because you in many people's eyes and the eyes of the purists,

2464
02:28:33.410 --> 02:28:36.560
you de legitimize.
It loses value.
Yes,

2465
02:28:36.620 --> 02:28:39.620
I agree 100% it loses value to it.
Especially like,

2466
02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:44.180
like what I did make lose value to fight and drinks left the fight.

2467
02:28:44.181 --> 02:28:48.290
Bisping left.
They fricken hate my guts.
So that's why I don't think so though,

2468
02:28:48.291 --> 02:28:52.610
because I think it's not good for the brand is not good and I know it's not
good.

2469
02:28:52.620 --> 02:28:56.590
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm not stupid.
I realize it,
but I had no choice man.
I go back there,

2470
02:28:56.591 --> 02:29:00.200
I had in condition,
you know what I mean?
But I think it was not my aim.

2471
02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:03.650
Robbie Lawler won the title and then Robbie Lawler lost the title,

2472
02:29:03.670 --> 02:29:04.503
the Tyrone Woodley.

2473
02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:08.120
Nobody doesn't think Tyron Woodley is the legitimate champion because you

2474
02:29:08.121 --> 02:29:11.630
retired.
No,
I mean it's,
it's,
it's a clear path.
It makes sense.

2475
02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:15.530
Then on that is the same thing.
Like I said,
it's not WWE man.

2476
02:29:15.610 --> 02:29:18.890
I have to do what is the best for me and then,
and I don't regret my decision.

2477
02:29:19.450 --> 02:29:22.370
I regret that I stayed too long.
I should have retire.

2478
02:29:22.730 --> 02:29:27.730
Maybe take my first stop after the as cause Diaz was the fight,

2479
02:29:28.001 --> 02:29:32.720
the big fight and what,
you know what I mean?
It was the main guy you know,

2480
02:29:32.721 --> 02:29:36.740
to fight then after Russia,
but there's always that guy Joe,
that's that thing.

2481
02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:39.950
There's always another,
if we can guide as a way this sport,

2482
02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:44.570
you know we always believe that after that wall it will be no wall,

2483
02:29:44.571 --> 02:29:47.060
but now man is always another,
another,
another,
another.

2484
02:29:47.061 --> 02:29:49.650
And then I realized that it's an,

2485
02:29:49.651 --> 02:29:53.750
every fight are more expected than other and now are bigger than the other and

2486
02:29:53.751 --> 02:29:56.660
it is what it is,
man.
This is what it is.
It's a hard,

2487
02:29:56.690 --> 02:30:01.010
very hard life mentally like depending on your wire.

2488
02:30:01.040 --> 02:30:03.560
Psychologically for me it was a lot to take.

2489
02:30:03.770 --> 02:30:06.410
Well I think it's not a lot to say for me.
I have a theory about that.

2490
02:30:06.470 --> 02:30:08.810
One of the reasons why it's a lot to takes cause you're smart.

2491
02:30:09.380 --> 02:30:12.950
I think smart people,
they,
they entertain all the possibilities.

2492
02:30:12.951 --> 02:30:16.180
They think about all the possibilities.
They're aware of all the variables.
I,
I'm,

2493
02:30:16.280 --> 02:30:19.340
I'm a thinker.
I think I lost.
Yeah.
And allies I take a lot.

2494
02:30:19.480 --> 02:30:23.120
I mean it's good because it's prepared you very well and it's made you this

2495
02:30:23.121 --> 02:30:25.270
incredible martial artists.
But it's also,

2496
02:30:25.271 --> 02:30:28.400
it creates a lot of anxiety because you're aware of all the possibilities.

2497
02:30:28.610 --> 02:30:30.980
Whereas a person who doesn't think that much,
it's just,

2498
02:30:30.981 --> 02:30:32.690
I'm just going to go in there and fuck people up.

2499
02:30:32.900 --> 02:30:35.270
Like that person might have an easier path to fight,

2500
02:30:35.271 --> 02:30:38.720
but they might also have a shorter limited potential.
Absolutely.

2501
02:30:38.721 --> 02:30:41.870
Cause they're not aware of all the possibilities and they're not aware of all

2502
02:30:41.871 --> 02:30:44.840
their flaws and all not aware of other strengths and weaknesses.

2503
02:30:45.020 --> 02:30:48.350
They just know what they've done that's worked and they just keep doing that.

2504
02:30:48.530 --> 02:30:52.580
And instead of developing this incredibly well rounded game,
they have a very,

2505
02:30:52.581 --> 02:30:56.930
very,
uh,
limited game.
But that limited game works on some people.

2506
02:30:57.170 --> 02:31:01.980
I agree.
It's,
it's,
it's this sport,
the sport in general.
It's Kinda,

2507
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:05.530
it's Kinda not fair when you look at it.
Like,
look at Demetrius Johnson.

2508
02:31:05.531 --> 02:31:09.320
Spraberry right now.
The best ever.
The best ever.
Yeah,
I agree.

2509
02:31:09.380 --> 02:31:14.150
Like man,
when I talk about confidence and skills,

2510
02:31:14.151 --> 02:31:16.230
man weathers the better guide in this.

2511
02:31:17.690 --> 02:31:21.420
What better guide and this Dominik Cruz freaking amazing.

2512
02:31:21.750 --> 02:31:25.650
Uh,
man,
Tj Dillashaw that's one fight.
Look,

2513
02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:27.210
I don't watch every fight.
I came,

2514
02:31:27.540 --> 02:31:31.890
I don't watch every fight because I'm not a fan of every fighter,

2515
02:31:32.430 --> 02:31:37.430
but if there's a fight that I will pay my home to get to sit in front and fly

2516
02:31:37.891 --> 02:31:42.170
myself.
Is Dominick,
uh,
uh,

2517
02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:46.680
Demetrius Johnson against Tj Dillashaw?
Absolutely.
I eman they asked to be done.

2518
02:31:46.681 --> 02:31:50.020
This is what has to be done.
Crazy.
I agree.
I don't,

2519
02:31:50.220 --> 02:31:54.930
there was always things and in fact,
or that we don't know why it doesn't happen.

2520
02:31:54.931 --> 02:31:58.710
Maybe we don't know where everything unfortunately.
And um,

2521
02:32:00.150 --> 02:32:03.580
yeah,
like,
like back in the Damien Anderson Silva is a lot of the didn't happen.

2522
02:32:03.600 --> 02:32:07.080
And is there stuff that people don't know that led that back in the day I taught

2523
02:32:07.081 --> 02:32:11.410
and then I wanted to take care of it didn't happen,
but they,

2524
02:32:11.440 --> 02:32:16.020
there's this fight man.
It's just crazy man.
Sometime he sat in this sport like,

2525
02:32:16.050 --> 02:32:17.970
like you have a fight like Mayweather,

2526
02:32:18.060 --> 02:32:22.680
Mayweather Pacquiao and it did not happen.
It sucked.
But it is what it is,

2527
02:32:22.681 --> 02:32:23.161
you know?
Well,

2528
02:32:23.161 --> 02:32:28.161
I think that Demetrius wants Tj Dillashaw to fight once at 125 pounds.

2529
02:32:28.381 --> 02:32:29.460
Show that he can make the weight,

2530
02:32:29.700 --> 02:32:32.610
especially when he's dealing with this incredibly long wind streak.

2531
02:32:32.610 --> 02:32:34.770
He's defended his title more than any other champion ever.

2532
02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:38.530
So he doesn't want someone to come along and break his wind street.

2533
02:32:38.550 --> 02:32:41.040
It doesn't even make it the way they,
this as a,

2534
02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:45.360
I have thought about this because I've been in this similar situation.

2535
02:32:46.050 --> 02:32:50.940
This is a way to take care of this with the lawyers you write in the contract

2536
02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:55.230
that if don't make weight is no fight and the purse,

2537
02:32:55.470 --> 02:32:57.630
you make the guy paying you what purse,

2538
02:32:58.110 --> 02:33:01.680
not the UFC dealer show would take the papers,
give the purse.

2539
02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:05.460
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
No I do,
but I think it'd be game enough to do it.

2540
02:33:05.461 --> 02:33:08.070
It's a freaking risk.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2541
02:33:08.071 --> 02:33:11.940
But I think Demetrius is worried that the UFC would pressure him into fighting

2542
02:33:11.941 --> 02:33:15.390
Tj,
even if Tj doesn't make the weight.
So we have Tj Maxx for sure.
For sure.

2543
02:33:15.391 --> 02:33:19.890
You make it will make him look bad in terms of with the fan base and his Bram

2544
02:33:19.890 --> 02:33:22.590
Agri.
However we can make it through the lawyer to the,

2545
02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:26.490
if it's that much weight difference,
there was no fight.
Right.
You know,

2546
02:33:26.780 --> 02:33:30.570
there's always fights.
Men,
Joe,
there's something I haven't learned.

2547
02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:32.580
Fight can be negotiated the way you want.

2548
02:33:32.581 --> 02:33:36.600
I can negotiate a fight like depending the the laws.
Okay.

2549
02:33:36.601 --> 02:33:40.890
I want you to wear pink a speedos when I,
if I do,
it's under contract.

2550
02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:44.150
You have to wear a spring speedo.
I want you to wear this or,

2551
02:33:44.220 --> 02:33:48.600
or any fifth round or if it's everything could be done.

2552
02:33:48.601 --> 02:33:53.190
If it's written and,
and,
and by the law.
Uh,
agreed.

2553
02:33:53.300 --> 02:33:56.150
Yeah.
It could be worked out.
I don't think Demetrius do.

2554
02:33:56.151 --> 02:34:00.020
Whether it be worked out this guys,
let's do it,
man.
Let's go.
Well,

2555
02:34:00.030 --> 02:34:04.290
I think right now the rematch has set for Cody Garbrandt versus Tj Dillashaw and

2556
02:34:04.291 --> 02:34:06.390
mighty mouse just went through shoulder surgery.

2557
02:34:06.830 --> 02:34:08.190
He's rehabilitating your shoulder.

2558
02:34:08.191 --> 02:34:11.480
That's going to take quite a while and there there's Dominik Dominik Cruz to win

2559
02:34:11.481 --> 02:34:15.910
that mixed match.
He's amazing.
He's amazing.
I like to watch him a lot.
Yeah,

2560
02:34:15.930 --> 02:34:17.100
there's a lot of talent.

2561
02:34:17.140 --> 02:34:20.410
There's a lot of talent in the UFC right now that that smaller guy are so much

2562
02:34:20.411 --> 02:34:23.020
better than the bigger guy.
I am betting you that true.
Like,

2563
02:34:23.021 --> 02:34:25.450
like if I would have that same size as these guy,
man,

2564
02:34:25.451 --> 02:34:28.780
I don't want to fight these guy,
man.
I wish they would beat the shit out of me.

2565
02:34:29.190 --> 02:34:32.220
Like no man,
they don't have gravity fucking with them aggregate.

2566
02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:34.420
They know that that gravity,
they're not have that size.

2567
02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:38.800
But there are so good man.
It's so good to watch them.
I'm learning.

2568
02:34:38.801 --> 02:34:39.581
I'm learning a lot.

2569
02:34:39.581 --> 02:34:44.560
I watch a lot more of these guide and then in terms of for learning men,

2570
02:34:45.010 --> 02:34:47.890
I'll beautiful.
Was that on Bard at Demetrius Johnson?

2571
02:34:47.891 --> 02:34:52.450
Did I shit Medis slam slam to the arm bar in the air and he,
no,

2572
02:34:52.590 --> 02:34:56.950
I practice it.
Been trading learned.
I learned from these guy,
man.

2573
02:34:56.951 --> 02:34:58.910
I learned from a lot of these guys.
Yeah.

2574
02:34:59.080 --> 02:35:03.130
Tj Dillashaw he switch men every time he's changing.
Beautiful.

2575
02:35:03.340 --> 02:35:04.420
Dominick Cruz man,

2576
02:35:04.421 --> 02:35:09.421
his footwork and said same trained with Duane Ludwig a longtime ago.

2577
02:35:09.881 --> 02:35:12.300
Yes.
I have a spar w we train a,

2578
02:35:12.310 --> 02:35:16.600
when I was in Denver helping Nathan Marquardt for a fight.
I spar.

2579
02:35:16.630 --> 02:35:21.100
Uh,
Manny was crazy.
Spar with Dwayne,
Nate,

2580
02:35:21.100 --> 02:35:25.720
Shane cat when through all my was Shane car.
That was that smart.
But I did.
Yeah.

2581
02:35:25.870 --> 02:35:29.080
Fuck that.
Yeah,
that wasn't that smart.
I was back in the day.

2582
02:35:29.081 --> 02:35:32.800
Maybe I should have been smarter.
Man is as big as your head.
Thanks God.

2583
02:35:32.801 --> 02:35:35.440
I didn't get heard but oh my God.
It was,
yeah.

2584
02:35:35.450 --> 02:35:38.330
I won't point remember anything in a training.
[inaudible]
it wasn't grounded.

2585
02:35:38.340 --> 02:35:42.730
Pounded with another guy that is like a light everywhere.
He knock him out.
Yeah.

2586
02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:46.570
He's uh,
he's that big monster.
But that was stupid on my part.
When you're young,

2587
02:35:46.571 --> 02:35:50.260
you do stupid shit.
I should not have done it.
Yeah.
Fuck that.
Huh?

2588
02:35:50.730 --> 02:35:55.720
Where did he weigh back then?
You ways,
either me or him.
I just say,
man,

2589
02:35:55.730 --> 02:36:00.010
hey car Whitney's,
it might be like,
yeah,
he's a big guy.

2590
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:03.430
Fucking huge.
And I know it.
That was stupid,
but I did it and then I,
you know,

2591
02:36:04.060 --> 02:36:08.920
you move man.
You gotta fucking move.
Yeah man.
He hit,
I hit and run.

2592
02:36:08.921 --> 02:36:11.860
Man Doesn't run.
Don't try to stand in their pocket with this guy.

2593
02:36:11.861 --> 02:36:16.420
And if you go for a take down,
you go in and out and then quick man,
Holy Shit.

2594
02:36:16.940 --> 02:36:20.230
Your timing has to be perfect.
Fuck that.

2595
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:25.780
The only one round one round.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
All right.

2596
02:36:25.781 --> 02:36:29.860
As far as we went with everybody,
you know,
and there's this thing like I,
I,

2597
02:36:30.460 --> 02:36:33.580
when we train with the other guys,
especially guys I train with David,

2598
02:36:33.670 --> 02:36:36.520
everybody I traveled with Jon Jones,
I tried to,
it was part with everybody,

2599
02:36:36.521 --> 02:36:41.440
which it's,
it's,
it's good experience there,
you know?
And there's guys that,

2600
02:36:41.441 --> 02:36:45.070
that spar like it's our life depends on it.
Like it's a real fight.

2601
02:36:45.071 --> 02:36:46.150
There's other guys of course,

2602
02:36:46.180 --> 02:36:49.090
depending if you get ready for a fight or not and if it,

2603
02:36:49.170 --> 02:36:50.050
depending on the situation,

2604
02:36:50.051 --> 02:36:54.490
but there is when it's just a spring for spring that you're not in training camp

2605
02:36:54.491 --> 02:36:58.840
or whatever,
you spar.
But there are still guys that I see younger guy day they,

2606
02:36:58.930 --> 02:37:00.910
they load,
they lose a lot of their,

2607
02:37:01.540 --> 02:37:06.060
their years of fighting in the gym because they fight in the gym and he snuck

2608
02:37:06.070 --> 02:37:10.240
good for your brain man.
Holy Shit.
I never be a big,

2609
02:37:10.270 --> 02:37:11.470
been a big fan of this.

2610
02:37:12.310 --> 02:37:15.890
I feel like even now in my last spring guys a Camarda,
I mean,

2611
02:37:15.891 --> 02:37:18.170
but I have to go hard because otherwise they're going to hurt me.

2612
02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:22.100
But that's not because of meat as because my freaking trainer is telling them,

2613
02:37:22.550 --> 02:37:25.370
you got to put him away.
We're going to praise it or know what I mean.

2614
02:37:25.460 --> 02:37:29.480
So why does for us do that?
He's completely,
completely crazy for her ass man.

2615
02:37:29.481 --> 02:37:33.140
He's insane.
I love him to death.
But man,
he's completely insane.
He's,

2616
02:37:33.141 --> 02:37:37.670
my son sees my A's Pie.
He May,
I called him,
pay me John.
I do.
You know what,
John,

2617
02:37:37.671 --> 02:37:41.580
I call him the emperor.
The Emperor John Ice though or that you would,

2618
02:37:41.590 --> 02:37:45.230
they all have nicknames.
That's hilarious man.
Man.
They,
they,
they,
they tough guy.

2619
02:37:45.650 --> 02:37:46.850
John is another one.

2620
02:37:46.851 --> 02:37:49.480
Like when I'm in training camp and he put me with Gordon Ryan,

2621
02:37:49.490 --> 02:37:53.210
the Gabby throw it in one after Jake Shit,
I gotta go,
go,
go,
go a damn man.

2622
02:37:53.210 --> 02:37:55.700
I get smashed.
I get out like a pretzel.
Like

2623
02:37:58.690 --> 02:38:01.490
sometime it's not good for my coffin and sometime it is.
Sometime I'm like,

2624
02:38:01.491 --> 02:38:03.510
shit man.
I just,
it's hard to tell.

2625
02:38:03.511 --> 02:38:08.310
I have a hard life is a darkness inside John's brain.
Yeah,
man.
And it's hard.

2626
02:38:08.690 --> 02:38:11.000
It's hard,
man.
I made it,

2627
02:38:11.001 --> 02:38:14.240
I made a lot of good change for preparation.
Like,
you know,

2628
02:38:14.250 --> 02:38:15.650
I used to train like in on the ground,

2629
02:38:15.651 --> 02:38:18.010
I find the wing fight around a five minute.
You'd have,

2630
02:38:18.011 --> 02:38:21.530
we're going to spend five minutes on the ground when you train for an MMA fight.

2631
02:38:21.890 --> 02:38:26.600
So I did treatment around when one minute break in make you and starting form

2632
02:38:26.660 --> 02:38:31.660
scrambling position like Nepal had had an arm control then go right or mount

2633
02:38:32.391 --> 02:38:36.260
position Gopal we didn't start like shaken and then because you lose time while

2634
02:38:36.261 --> 02:38:39.810
you making,
so we start from position control at end goal.

2635
02:38:40.330 --> 02:38:42.560
So he make you more active in when you fight,

2636
02:38:43.010 --> 02:38:45.410
make you more reports on this stick.
That's how I,

2637
02:38:45.411 --> 02:38:47.570
and now I teach at Tristar 12 for rest.

2638
02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:52.600
Like I do it because I love it at 12 Ferris and that's why I teach the people

2639
02:38:52.821 --> 02:38:53.180
no,

2640
02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:56.180
no more five minute round when you drain for and it made me a fight two minute

2641
02:38:56.181 --> 02:38:56.840
round,

2642
02:38:56.840 --> 02:39:00.920
three minute round and a stone and you will never spend the entire five minute

2643
02:39:00.930 --> 02:39:01.763
round there.

2644
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:06.740
The minute that you get to spend on the ground that you have to be very economic

2645
02:39:06.741 --> 02:39:09.350
and very important is when you see something,
boom.

2646
02:39:09.380 --> 02:39:12.230
That's how I got into a fight with Bisping.
I see the neck boom,

2647
02:39:12.470 --> 02:39:15.920
I let him stand up,
do the,
the the leg,

2648
02:39:15.921 --> 02:39:17.630
drag it up right away.

2649
02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:21.380
I probably would not have reacted the same way a few years ago,

2650
02:39:21.381 --> 02:39:26.381
which would be more taking a position and safe kind of mentality.

2651
02:39:27.440 --> 02:39:32.430
You know what I mean?
That we need to learn it too.
Yeah,

2652
02:39:32.570 --> 02:39:33.380
it was this way,

2653
02:39:33.380 --> 02:39:37.640
but I practice it a lot because I learned the pattern of Bisping that when you

2654
02:39:37.641 --> 02:39:41.720
do this,
he liked to do with this.
So I predict we've,
we've,
we've,

2655
02:39:41.721 --> 02:39:43.310
we've worked on it,
you know,

2656
02:39:43.311 --> 02:39:47.510
like when I mean like it's stuff that we worry wasn't in my,
like I said,
like my,

2657
02:39:47.511 --> 02:39:52.460
uh,
my autopilot already in my hard disk.
So it's just reaction.

2658
02:39:52.461 --> 02:39:54.980
You don't know what to have time to think,
which before,

2659
02:39:55.760 --> 02:39:58.040
when you don't train like this,
you're trained in five minute,

2660
02:39:58.130 --> 02:40:02.190
it's slower pace or you're thinking more Shih Tzu is,
is more,
uh,
um,

2661
02:40:03.380 --> 02:40:06.170
it's not much of a dynamic.
It's more easy metric.
Sport.

2662
02:40:06.171 --> 02:40:10.100
Sometime you did make that is more,
is symmetric and position.

2663
02:40:10.340 --> 02:40:12.770
So you don't want to be like this for him and you want to be like bang,
Bang,

2664
02:40:12.771 --> 02:40:16.920
Bang fast.
And you know what I mean?
Make your,
make you more,
you know what I mean?

2665
02:40:16.921 --> 02:40:19.920
More efficient.
What kind of training you're doing now?
I mean you,

2666
02:40:19.921 --> 02:40:21.770
you're going to train with Freddie Roach now.

2667
02:40:22.060 --> 02:40:26.340
See how much time are you spending training?
I try.
I try normally twice a day.

2668
02:40:26.370 --> 02:40:30.510
Everyday still.
Yeah.
I don't train hard every day.
Twice a day.

2669
02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:34.020
Some days I do once a day.

2670
02:40:34.050 --> 02:40:39.050
I tried to train at least four days a week that are twice a day and maybe two

2671
02:40:39.991 --> 02:40:44.610
days that are a once a day at depending what I do.
Uh,
for example,

2672
02:40:44.820 --> 02:40:48.660
I wanted to get on a train one.
So day to day is with Freddy tomorrow have a,

2673
02:40:48.930 --> 02:40:52.490
I do it,
this new thing now it's,
that really changed my life to it.

2674
02:40:52.590 --> 02:40:57.170
I trained in a pool and all lift weight you don't live with now man.
I don't,

2675
02:40:57.250 --> 02:40:59.970
I don't really,
I still don't believe in conditioning.
You say conditioning.

2676
02:40:59.971 --> 02:41:03.330
I don't believe,
I don't believe,
I believe it's an illusion.
Everybody has a,

2677
02:41:03.740 --> 02:41:04.710
it's efficiency.

2678
02:41:04.740 --> 02:41:07.730
So I want to get tired more than the others because more efficient cause

2679
02:41:07.740 --> 02:41:12.630
everybody had their stores on level is in shape.
You know what I mean?
But,

2680
02:41:12.631 --> 02:41:16.410
but I trained in the pool.
I do,
uh,
for example,

2681
02:41:16.411 --> 02:41:19.720
I have resistance stuff,
equipment and I trained in the post.

2682
02:41:19.721 --> 02:41:22.850
So it's like my weight training aid,
we in a pool,
like it's what you do,

2683
02:41:22.860 --> 02:41:26.190
flies we have.
Uh,
but that guidance is not that good.

2684
02:41:26.191 --> 02:41:29.520
And this is my soul that works all the time.
And it's like doing flies,

2685
02:41:29.521 --> 02:41:32.550
but instead of that yet,
but agonists and antagonists,
you do,
I fly and,
and,

2686
02:41:32.551 --> 02:41:35.280
and the,
and the pool in the same time,
Bush Paul,

2687
02:41:35.550 --> 02:41:39.180
and you're doing it with rubber bands resistance.

2688
02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:43.650
No resistance equipment is like,
uh,
Shit.

2689
02:41:43.740 --> 02:41:48.020
I wish I would know where your table,
no,
Eh,
it's not a capital a resistant,

2690
02:41:48.060 --> 02:41:49.550
it's like a handle and send,

2691
02:41:49.551 --> 02:41:53.070
you would think they're Russian developed this like in days long time ago where

2692
02:41:53.071 --> 02:41:55.560
we just start to learn now about it.

2693
02:41:55.950 --> 02:41:58.590
And the Russian were way more advanced than us in the,
in the,

2694
02:41:58.730 --> 02:42:03.590
it's ea Gavin Mcmullin that made me discover this form of training when I at

2695
02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:07.470
Rehab,
my ACO.
So he,
um,

2696
02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:09.830
he hates to weight training.
He said Ha,
weight training.

2697
02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:12.820
They load up your joint damage,
your joints,

2698
02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:14.250
you know it depending on what you do it,

2699
02:42:14.251 --> 02:42:18.200
but when you go evi damaged your joining.
It is true.
That's why I stay.

2700
02:42:18.230 --> 02:42:22.740
I look young and I feel better at 37 now.
If it wouldn't be for this,
my,
my,

2701
02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:27.510
my old sir,
I feel better now at 37 that I felt like 25 mark.
My word is true.

2702
02:42:27.900 --> 02:42:32.220
The only differences let's I go out with like my birthday was may 19 last

2703
02:42:32.221 --> 02:42:35.190
Saturday I got completely wasted drunk.

2704
02:42:35.460 --> 02:42:39.780
It takes me more days to recuperate because I'm 37 and when I was 25 but

2705
02:42:39.810 --> 02:42:44.760
strength wise like I feel just more powerful.
Better.
Hmm.
Yeah man.

2706
02:42:44.770 --> 02:42:47.100
We,
there is hope for the older men there.

2707
02:42:47.101 --> 02:42:50.970
There is hope that we can lasts better.
We can have a better living.

2708
02:42:51.030 --> 02:42:53.250
It's kind of crazy that you don't believe it's strength and condition.

2709
02:42:53.251 --> 02:42:55.500
I don't think that is the thing that everybody does today.

2710
02:42:55.830 --> 02:42:58.930
Now I know that he's involved with strength and conditioning because sometime

2711
02:42:58.931 --> 02:43:03.450
they mixed up their performance and strength conditioning because of the
steroid.

2712
02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:08.460
I believe.
I love people.
They say,
oh,
my new nutrition is because of this,
this,

2713
02:43:08.461 --> 02:43:12.430
or my new training,
make me be stronger.
Look,
I'm a better fighter and man,

2714
02:43:12.690 --> 02:43:15.820
maybe it's because you taking something,
you know what I mean?

2715
02:43:16.330 --> 02:43:21.330
I believe and UFC like let's say I spar with some pro box.

2716
02:43:22.720 --> 02:43:26.080
Okay.
Uh,
for example like yes you right here.
Yeah.
This one an example.

2717
02:43:26.170 --> 02:43:29.450
So you've got low ankle weights on.
So what it is,
oh,

2718
02:43:29.870 --> 02:43:32.420
but they create that resistance on the way up.
You see?
So it's so,

2719
02:43:32.860 --> 02:43:36.650
so he doesn't load up my joint and you just explode.
Again.

2720
02:43:36.690 --> 02:43:39.050
This is like pistol squat,
but I,
there's like a hundreds,

2721
02:43:39.100 --> 02:43:42.240
like a exercise like this,
like I sounded with maybe not a hundred,
but they,

2722
02:43:42.241 --> 02:43:46.730
there's so many.
Yeah man.
There's that you can do with your,

2723
02:43:46.780 --> 02:43:51.550
every part of your buddy,
you can do an exercise and the Russians got it too.
Yes.

2724
02:43:51.551 --> 02:43:55.930
And,
and also the NFL football player payroll a lot train with that because it

2725
02:43:55.931 --> 02:44:00.520
increase your power in works.
So that thing that you don't have is the stability.

2726
02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:02.440
But if you want to increase your power,

2727
02:44:02.470 --> 02:44:06.430
it helped for increasing the power of four muscle,
the fiber of the muscle.

2728
02:44:06.460 --> 02:44:07.293
You know what I mean?

2729
02:44:07.720 --> 02:44:12.720
It won't make you a better fighter but it will longevity wise keep your,

2730
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:19.630
your car,
your,
your,
your car,
your vehicle,
your vehicle.
Ltr.

2731
02:44:19.990 --> 02:44:24.130
That's why I do strength conditioning.
I don't do for making me a better fighter.

2732
02:44:24.131 --> 02:44:28.480
I do it because I want to look good.
I want to be muscular,
I want to,

2733
02:44:28.481 --> 02:44:31.480
I want to be a balance.

2734
02:44:31.540 --> 02:44:34.180
I want to be at a longer longevity.

2735
02:44:34.300 --> 02:44:36.400
It's not going to make me hit harder or stronger.

2736
02:44:36.770 --> 02:44:40.030
Cal Know Freddie Roach might help me hit stronger for example.

2737
02:44:40.090 --> 02:44:43.450
You know what I mean?
John,
that hour would make me be more creative.

2738
02:44:43.451 --> 02:44:46.870
I have better on bars and the fair Ras would make me,
you know what I mean?

2739
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:50.890
Like better fighter and in terms of giving me knowledge and different things

2740
02:44:51.380 --> 02:44:53.390
that that's what I believe could be wrong or like,

2741
02:44:53.450 --> 02:44:56.320
like I know we think different ways in that regard.

2742
02:44:56.321 --> 02:44:57.790
We argued before I bought this,

2743
02:44:58.030 --> 02:45:00.520
but that's why I've been eating open minded and when a lot of times when I'm

2744
02:45:00.521 --> 02:45:02.350
arguing,
I'm just playing the devil's advocate.

2745
02:45:02.351 --> 02:45:05.770
I don't think there's any one way to do these things.
Like example,

2746
02:45:05.840 --> 02:45:10.440
I spar for example,
or you're a Jujitsu guy,

2747
02:45:10.460 --> 02:45:13.450
make it an experimentation.
Go wrestle or with a real wrestler,

2748
02:45:13.510 --> 02:45:16.800
like a high level wrestler,
pure wrestler,
right?
Wrestle with him.

2749
02:45:17.530 --> 02:45:18.450
You're going to get much.

2750
02:45:18.580 --> 02:45:22.810
If you're going to get tired much quicker than him for sure it's not because

2751
02:45:22.811 --> 02:45:25.120
he's got a better car do within you,
you know?

2752
02:45:25.121 --> 02:45:29.500
Or maybe he is it like I did depending,
but then after that go on the ground,

2753
02:45:29.530 --> 02:45:32.260
sit down and shake his hand and start rolling on the ground.

2754
02:45:32.350 --> 02:45:35.440
I guarantee he's going to get more tired than you because if you never,

2755
02:45:35.441 --> 02:45:37.730
then Jujitsu is going to spend a lot more energy is again,

2756
02:45:37.820 --> 02:45:41.950
you're going to be much more efficient than him even though maybe as a better

2757
02:45:41.951 --> 02:45:44.410
car in and then you,
if you take a vo two Max test,

2758
02:45:44.411 --> 02:45:47.740
maybe he's going to score better.
However you're more efficient.

2759
02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:51.820
It's all about efficiency.
Yeah.
They tried to sell you the product,

2760
02:45:51.821 --> 02:45:53.740
they tried to sell you the program.

2761
02:45:53.741 --> 02:45:57.430
They tell it's all freaking out for Thai advertising or life is made of

2762
02:45:57.431 --> 02:46:00.450
advertising.
That's why I was angry.
And I like,

2763
02:46:00.580 --> 02:46:02.160
we talk about intermittent fast thing,

2764
02:46:02.161 --> 02:46:07.161
like there's no pills for it is there is nobody that makes money.

2765
02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:09.790
That's why nobody talks about it.
But it's efficient.

2766
02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:12.050
The oldest remedy in the world,
you know what I mean?

2767
02:46:12.051 --> 02:46:16.880
In three days you can rebuild your,
your immune system and your gut.

2768
02:46:16.970 --> 02:46:19.280
All,
all of it in three days are fascinating.
You do it.

2769
02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:23.120
Take an Mli assault with di water.
You go train is perfect.

2770
02:46:23.121 --> 02:46:25.910
You go in autophagy phases their best,
you know I am,

2771
02:46:26.630 --> 02:46:29.600
but nobody talks about the same thing in,
in cards,
zoo and all that.

2772
02:46:29.601 --> 02:46:33.870
They have to commercialize eyes.
Their money is it,

2773
02:46:33.930 --> 02:46:37.760
it's all about selling you the thing or life.

2774
02:46:37.790 --> 02:46:42.440
It's all about branding.
Everywhere we'll go with freaking commercial.

2775
02:46:42.590 --> 02:46:44.400
We were surround by commercial if you want it.

2776
02:46:44.401 --> 02:46:47.030
And it's something that we don't even realize it because it's so present in our

2777
02:46:47.031 --> 02:46:50.630
life.
So it's,
it's,
it's,
uh,
it's not gonna make me a better fighter.

2778
02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:55.370
I do it because I fell good,
developed my muscle.
It is good for me to be,

2779
02:46:56.270 --> 02:47:00.260
you know,
to have a muscle for,
for my brand,
for,
for me,
for advertising,

2780
02:47:00.261 --> 02:47:04.730
for even for myself,
felt good.
You know what I mean?
Joey fell silent,
you know,

2781
02:47:04.731 --> 02:47:06.740
and I get it.
Yeah,
that's a real true it.

2782
02:47:06.741 --> 02:47:09.830
It's not going to make me hit you think this is gonna make me have a better
hook.

2783
02:47:09.890 --> 02:47:14.690
No,
man,
it's,
it's,
it doesn't transcend like that,
right.
Timing.

2784
02:47:14.691 --> 02:47:18.230
Precision a forms,
you know,
everything.
You,
it's not the,

2785
02:47:20.390 --> 02:47:25.370
if Georgia has had the smallest arm I think is one of the smallest army hit like

2786
02:47:25.371 --> 02:47:28.190
crazy.
Hey Daddy,
when you look at his build,

2787
02:47:28.191 --> 02:47:30.620
he wasn't like a Mike Tyson or a Lennox Lewis.

2788
02:47:30.650 --> 02:47:33.500
My friend had done is Stevenson like,
I mean he's,
Bill is on the hill,

2789
02:47:33.530 --> 02:47:36.230
he's an athlete.
But man,
I spar with him many times.

2790
02:47:36.350 --> 02:47:40.730
He hit like fucking track is probably the heaviest hitter ever seen in my life

2791
02:47:41.180 --> 02:47:44.540
and what I mean,
and he's not like,
he's strong,
he's athletic.

2792
02:47:44.541 --> 02:47:48.490
But there is guide more.
More should look,
look stronger to him or bodybuilder.

2793
02:47:48.540 --> 02:47:51.740
Yeah,
because that's because of his form.
The weight transfer,
his weight is,

2794
02:47:51.920 --> 02:47:55.270
is vector of force.
Everything.
His technique,
his timing's precision.

2795
02:47:55.310 --> 02:47:59.500
Everything is boom,
don't you?
They're a fakey bone structure to a little bit too,

2796
02:47:59.501 --> 02:48:03.820
right?
You actually power your freaking bad kick man.
Like this is something,

2797
02:48:03.830 --> 02:48:05.180
isn't it?
Because you were there and I said

2798
02:48:06.820 --> 02:48:08.870
the human being that have hit,

2799
02:48:09.350 --> 02:48:14.060
that had produced the highest amount of force that I have ever witnessed in my

2800
02:48:14.061 --> 02:48:18.110
life is human,
which are free.
And I'm not gonna say it like this.

2801
02:48:18.120 --> 02:48:18.953
This is their truth.

2802
02:48:19.310 --> 02:48:24.310
I never seen a human being physically capable of hitting something with that

2803
02:48:25.431 --> 02:48:29.810
much force than you is that perfect example of what the,
of what we argue.

2804
02:48:30.320 --> 02:48:33.650
It's not because you're stronger.
Yeah.
You strong guy,
you're a good athletic guy,

2805
02:48:34.770 --> 02:48:37.940
but you know,
like you're,
you're older,
you're older than me,
you know,
and I like,

2806
02:48:37.960 --> 02:48:42.650
you know what I mean?
Like why?
Because this is your form to technique.

2807
02:48:42.651 --> 02:48:47.480
The vector of forced your technique.
Everything is all freaking perfect timing.

2808
02:48:47.720 --> 02:48:52.100
That's why when you turn in,
you make that spill out.
I don't care who you are.

2809
02:48:52.101 --> 02:48:55.190
If you find this,
and again,
do you hit that shit on their face,

2810
02:48:55.340 --> 02:48:57.320
you going to be dead.
You know,
and I'm not there,

2811
02:48:57.321 --> 02:49:00.920
but you're going to be knocked out,
man.
This is crazy.
You know what I mean?

2812
02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:04.520
When you did that,
there wasn't a completely insane,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

2813
02:49:04.620 --> 02:49:08.450
That's the one.
I'm still working on it,
but a way,
but I,

2814
02:49:08.451 --> 02:49:11.430
I can't do like you do with my knee coming out.

2815
02:49:11.431 --> 02:49:14.990
I feel like when I do inspiring the guys,
they see it and they,

2816
02:49:16.090 --> 02:49:17.790
so I have to keep my knee tuck.

2817
02:49:18.450 --> 02:49:21.630
I think you're just thinking that maybe it's because of karate.

2818
02:49:21.630 --> 02:49:25.710
I learned in a different way,
so my,
my brain is wired so much in a certain way.

2819
02:49:26.240 --> 02:49:30.870
The problem with karate is that lower knee than need down by the,

2820
02:49:30.950 --> 02:49:35.070
the other knee versus up by the hip.
When you bring it up by the hip,
there's,

2821
02:49:35.071 --> 02:49:36.240
there's much more leverage.

2822
02:49:36.241 --> 02:49:40.410
There's tremendous amount of force and the alignment of your lower leg,

2823
02:49:40.440 --> 02:49:44.340
the supporting leg and the kicking leg is better to generate force,

2824
02:49:44.490 --> 02:49:48.630
whereas the kicking leg is almost independent of the lower leg if you're going

2825
02:49:48.631 --> 02:49:52.620
up because they're not moving in the same direction.
One leg is going up,

2826
02:49:52.621 --> 02:49:54.500
the other ladies going forward,
so it's like,
Eh,

2827
02:49:54.660 --> 02:49:58.800
it's all goofy when the hip is up,
when you turn,

2828
02:49:58.980 --> 02:50:03.180
the hip is up.
This is pushing and this is going forward.
It's just so boom,

2829
02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:06.520
I wherever.
It's where the power comes from.
However,
do you you,

2830
02:50:06.550 --> 02:50:10.380
you come from taekwondo.
Is all the Olympic athlete like champion?

2831
02:50:10.410 --> 02:50:12.720
They don't do it like that.
No.
No.

2832
02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:15.680
They don't know exactly that you do with the different ways.
Right.

2833
02:50:16.790 --> 02:50:19.830
I never seen anybody hit as hard like I don't care if it's a punch,

2834
02:50:19.831 --> 02:50:22.740
like I never see a strike,
a strike.

2835
02:50:23.160 --> 02:50:26.880
I blow from a human being that hard,
man.
I remember that.

2836
02:50:26.881 --> 02:50:31.650
That bag when you were working in it was I fricking whole lot of us in the bag.

2837
02:50:31.651 --> 02:50:36.240
It was like a curves and the bag,
like with your,
your footprint in it.

2838
02:50:36.780 --> 02:50:39.420
It's sculpted.
Insane man.
It's a lot of power.

2839
02:50:39.450 --> 02:50:43.290
I was with Bravo way that I remember we were freaking out then you want to going

2840
02:50:43.291 --> 02:50:44.620
back and forward and I like,

2841
02:50:44.670 --> 02:50:49.050
you know we worked together because of Donna her.
Yeah,

2842
02:50:49.080 --> 02:50:52.680
cause John came up to me and just asking me because I was a commentator,

2843
02:50:52.890 --> 02:50:57.360
he said I need someone to help George with the fundamentals of is spinning back

2844
02:50:57.361 --> 02:51:02.130
kick.
He needs like a,
like a technique refresher.
Do you know anybody?
And I said,

2845
02:51:02.131 --> 02:51:03.780
this is gonna sound crazy.

2846
02:51:03.810 --> 02:51:08.040
I could just gotta to listen to me but I have a really good spinning back kick.

2847
02:51:08.041 --> 02:51:11.190
So that's how,
that's how you put it out.
Just smart.
I said he put,

2848
02:51:11.191 --> 02:51:15.300
he put it to me just asking.
No,
no,
he would taekwondo.
He knew.
He said no,

2849
02:51:15.330 --> 02:51:16.470
he knew that.

2850
02:51:16.471 --> 02:51:20.610
He told me he's going to ask you is going to ask if you could work with me.

2851
02:51:20.910 --> 02:51:24.490
That's funny because he said it to me.
No,
no,
no,
no.
Now,

2852
02:51:24.510 --> 02:51:27.390
but you want to put it this way.
It's John,
John Johnny's smart guy.
John,

2853
02:51:27.391 --> 02:51:30.030
he's very smart guy at at at w you would have,

2854
02:51:30.031 --> 02:51:32.760
if we'd had have said he would have kind of right because he,

2855
02:51:32.761 --> 02:51:36.330
I remember he said that to me and I say,
because he's like my son,
so he's in my,

2856
02:51:36.331 --> 02:51:39.840
in my,
in my size,
I,
Yay.
Right?
I'm like,
Nah.
I was rolling my eyes like,

2857
02:51:39.841 --> 02:51:42.300
what the fuck is Joe Rogan?
I didn't know what your background,

2858
02:51:42.301 --> 02:51:44.490
you know like I knew,
I know you did some marsh.

2859
02:51:44.500 --> 02:51:49.380
I thought he was going to think no,
but he knew that because our word get around.

2860
02:51:49.410 --> 02:51:51.630
That word gets around that you have a very strong spinning back,

2861
02:51:51.631 --> 02:51:53.160
kick it somewhere.

2862
02:51:53.250 --> 02:51:57.990
Somehow told him or he's seen it or B because he told me,
I remember he told me.

2863
02:51:58.260 --> 02:51:59.100
Then I was like,
Yay,

2864
02:51:59.101 --> 02:52:01.980
I'll do it when I go and train with Freddie Roach and I then I,

2865
02:52:01.981 --> 02:52:04.500
then I couldn't believe it.
I called him the same night.
I said,

2866
02:52:04.501 --> 02:52:05.770
what the fuck was that?

2867
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:09.820
<v 1>It was like,
this should be an elite.
If he ever have fights,</v>

2868
02:52:09.821 --> 02:52:13.600
mount is there should be a Lego.
You can kill someone with this van is insane,

2869
02:52:13.601 --> 02:52:17.950
man.
What's fucked up is it almost feels like a lie because it was so long ago.

2870
02:52:17.951 --> 02:52:20.770
It was a different life.
Like I stopped fighting.
I'm 50 years old.

2871
02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:25.150
I stopped fighting when I was 21 so I haven't fought in forever.

2872
02:52:25.210 --> 02:52:29.500
So it's just I've,
I keep doing it and training,
but I haven't done it so long.

2873
02:52:29.501 --> 02:52:33.790
So when I tell someone that I can do it,
am I dizzy?
Assess,
is that true?

2874
02:52:33.791 --> 02:52:37.900
I'd be like saying,
is it true?
How many people did you,
did you ever lie it up?

2875
02:52:37.901 --> 02:52:42.850
Someone with that video of me when I was 19 from a taekwondo tournament.

2876
02:52:43.090 --> 02:52:47.020
Megan,
a guy fly through the air.
Yeah,
I you serious tube?
Yeah.
Jamie.

2877
02:52:47.080 --> 02:52:51.190
Oh my God.
Is He okay now?
Is He alive or no?
Here it is right here.

2878
02:52:53.510 --> 02:52:53.830
<v 4>Okay.</v>

2879
02:52:53.830 --> 02:52:56.380
<v 1>Are you kidding me man?
Yeah.</v>

2880
02:52:56.381 --> 02:53:01.381
That's how fucking scratchy VHS video from 1986 you realize you didn't even cut

2881
02:53:04.361 --> 02:53:06.670
him.
Like,
you know,
we talk about precision,

2882
02:53:06.700 --> 02:53:11.050
like there was like w your technique is freaking price.
So powerful.

2883
02:53:11.051 --> 02:53:14.470
Like you got him where on the shoulder on the,
no,
no,
I caught him on the body.

2884
02:53:14.740 --> 02:53:18.190
It wasn't in the shoulder.
You can see it again,
but yeah,
it's okay.

2885
02:53:18.460 --> 02:53:21.550
It's just his arm is underneath his arm.

2886
02:53:23.700 --> 02:53:26.740
But I,
and put on that guy always because it's very encouraged.

2887
02:53:26.750 --> 02:53:30.700
The incredibly powerful I guy would do the same thing it him and the same spot.

2888
02:53:30.701 --> 02:53:34.770
It would probably be not get put away like that.
Oh,
okay.
Okay.
See a z,

2889
02:53:34.810 --> 02:53:38.380
see the impact.
It goes right into his body.

2890
02:53:38.381 --> 02:53:42.280
And then I extend and then when I extended he was,
I was Kinda like,

2891
02:53:43.190 --> 02:53:43.860
<v 4>yeah,</v>

2892
02:53:43.860 --> 02:53:46.050
<v 1>hi.
Yeah.
You see no,
no.
And that was,
that was perfect.</v>

2893
02:53:46.230 --> 02:53:50.880
And he just sailed through the air.
It's just,
it's a crazy,

2894
02:53:51.010 --> 02:53:54.840
it's,
it's got so much power.
It's just a crazy technique.

2895
02:53:54.841 --> 02:53:59.841
And I was raised in a taekwondo school that came from the old school taekwondo

2896
02:54:00.811 --> 02:54:04.740
before tournament's see General Che Che Hong Yee.

2897
02:54:04.980 --> 02:54:07.280
He trained,
he was the inventor of talk,

2898
02:54:07.281 --> 02:54:11.580
one of the founder of taekwondo and he trained a small handful of,
of,

2899
02:54:11.581 --> 02:54:15.600
of elite instructors.
And one of them was Jay Hahn.
Kim,

2900
02:54:15.601 --> 02:54:16.770
who was my instructor.

2901
02:54:17.040 --> 02:54:21.660
So my taekwondo background was the old school taekwondo.

2902
02:54:21.770 --> 02:54:25.140
Oh four Olympic.
It was even a consideration.

2903
02:54:25.380 --> 02:54:29.670
And so everyone trained for power.
It was a different thing.
Breaking.
Yeah,

2904
02:54:29.671 --> 02:54:32.760
it was just,
it was,
you had to be able to defend yourself in this treat.

2905
02:54:32.910 --> 02:54:37.740
My instructor,
his idea was if you couldn't hurt someone with a kick,

2906
02:54:37.830 --> 02:54:41.040
like why are you then practice it?
And these taekwondo guys and tournaments,

2907
02:54:41.041 --> 02:54:42.090
there weren't tapping each other.

2908
02:54:42.210 --> 02:54:46.500
They were just moving really fast trying to score points and he hated that shit.

2909
02:54:46.650 --> 02:54:50.520
He hated that shit and he felt like you had to load up more.

2910
02:54:50.521 --> 02:54:52.590
There had to be more power into those techniques.

2911
02:54:52.710 --> 02:54:56.030
And it wasn't quite as fast as like the,
the,

2912
02:54:56.060 --> 02:54:59.560
the really quick style Olympic point style taekwondo.
Yeah.

2913
02:54:59.580 --> 02:55:02.100
But that Olympic point style wouldn't hurt anybody.

2914
02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:05.450
You couldn't keep them of you.
But,
but the thing is hard for me,

2915
02:55:05.510 --> 02:55:08.690
like I tried to practice your ways,
but to have are,

2916
02:55:08.750 --> 02:55:11.810
I don't know if it's my hips or the way,
it's just,
it's just reps.

2917
02:55:11.811 --> 02:55:14.450
It's just repetition.
Okay,
we'll go over here after we're done.

2918
02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:18.240
It's freaking hard,
man.
This Jim here,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll,

2919
02:55:18.410 --> 02:55:20.390
I'll just give you a refresher.
Yeah.

2920
02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:23.900
A lot of it comes from the front leg side kick.
Nobody I know.

2921
02:55:23.901 --> 02:55:26.480
Do you know I go back,
I went back to karate training because I,

2922
02:55:26.481 --> 02:55:30.770
I've done more at but I was conferring from karate background and we've done it

2923
02:55:30.771 --> 02:55:33.590
straight.
Not Straight.
That had more Moight I don't,

2924
02:55:33.591 --> 02:55:36.740
I haven't done it for a kid begging for a long time cause they don't really do

2925
02:55:36.741 --> 02:55:39.070
that much and more.
They,
when I went back to karate,

2926
02:55:39.080 --> 02:55:42.470
my last fight and when I start to to Redo it,

2927
02:55:42.980 --> 02:55:46.840
I've been taught that again with their knee.
Yeah.
I liked your,

2928
02:55:47.090 --> 02:55:49.900
I liked the way you do it man.
Hey dra.
Yeah.

2929
02:55:49.940 --> 02:55:52.280
Then he has to be hired to get the full power into it.

2930
02:55:52.340 --> 02:55:56.360
I just don't have that same efficiency with it is great.
It can be done.

2931
02:55:56.690 --> 02:56:00.620
You can learn that efficiency shit a hundred percent it's freaking nuts man.

2932
02:56:01.010 --> 02:56:04.970
But it comes from learning first the right way to do the front leg side kick.

2933
02:56:05.150 --> 02:56:06.440
See the front leg side kick.

2934
02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:10.190
You developed a tomb that that knee comes up and then boom,

2935
02:56:10.310 --> 02:56:12.800
it's all in trust in that hip and pop it it forward.

2936
02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:15.230
And then once you develop the speed from doing that,

2937
02:56:15.380 --> 02:56:19.340
then you do it with the turn,
then it's turned boom.
It's the same thing.

2938
02:56:19.341 --> 02:56:22.550
It's that twist of the hip and the extension of the leg.

2939
02:56:22.670 --> 02:56:26.210
But then it's also the term first.
So the turn,
first boom,

2940
02:56:26.211 --> 02:56:28.840
and then the extension of the leg.
That's why that power comes from she,

2941
02:56:28.860 --> 02:56:30.320
it's all in a straight line.

2942
02:56:30.770 --> 02:56:34.640
And then the three 60 when the right leg is forward and you step forward and

2943
02:56:34.641 --> 02:56:37.640
then throw that was,
that's,
that's like getting hit by a train.

2944
02:56:38.460 --> 02:56:42.590
That's that one that I,
there's the strongest Cyrus is,
that shit's crazy.

2945
02:56:42.940 --> 02:56:47.840
You're running it somewhere.
You're not even in your prior mountain 50 shit.
Yeah,

2946
02:56:47.870 --> 02:56:51.590
but when I was 19 I could do it like a laser beam that is so fast,

2947
02:56:52.070 --> 02:56:55.850
you know like in that video.
I mean was just,
that's all I did though.
I mean what?

2948
02:56:55.851 --> 02:57:00.230
From the time I was 15 till the time I was 21 I didn't do shit.

2949
02:57:00.231 --> 02:57:03.800
I barely did any homework and then pay attention in school at all.

2950
02:57:03.950 --> 02:57:07.340
All I did was fight.
That's all I did was Daytop one though.
It's all I did.

2951
02:57:07.370 --> 02:57:11.390
I just want it to be in the Olympics.
I wanted to be a taekwondo champion.
Wow.

2952
02:57:11.450 --> 02:57:12.560
Yeah.
That's all I wanted to do it.

2953
02:57:12.561 --> 02:57:17.090
But then the problem was I started sparring with kickboxers getting fucked up

2954
02:57:17.270 --> 02:57:20.120
and I realized that taekwondo has no hands.

2955
02:57:20.380 --> 02:57:21.920
Like the hand techniques were useless.

2956
02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:25.040
And when I would be in a boxing ring and it would be sparring with someone,

2957
02:57:25.130 --> 02:57:28.010
they just get me in a corner.
It started fucking me up and I was like,
oh,

2958
02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:31.280
I don't know how to do this.
Like I need to learn how to box.

2959
02:57:31.430 --> 02:57:35.870
And so I realized taekwondo in a lot of situations is not effective.

2960
02:57:35.871 --> 02:57:39.530
It's not useful.
Yeah.
Like I needed to learn how to box first.

2961
02:57:39.660 --> 02:57:42.980
And so then I started training that and then I started getting dry train with

2962
02:57:42.981 --> 02:57:45.860
Moitai guys getting leg kicked.
I'm like,
ah fuck.

2963
02:57:46.510 --> 02:57:51.440
Cause we were doing like above the waist kickboxing and then I saw Rick Rufus

2964
02:57:51.441 --> 02:57:54.050
when he fought that a tie fighter,
you know,

2965
02:57:54.051 --> 02:57:57.470
this is like really important fight when Rick Fuck this guy and the guy just

2966
02:57:57.471 --> 02:58:01.830
chopped his fucking lays out Ronda.
I'm like,
ah,
I saw that fight.
However

2967
02:58:02.190 --> 02:58:05.460
<v 0>you put the same fight in the,
in the MMA contest,
like,</v>

2968
02:58:05.461 --> 02:58:09.060
I mean Rick roofers beat the shit out of him.
The first,
the first,

2969
02:58:09.360 --> 02:58:13.380
first I think few,
few,
a few minutes he killed a guy,

2970
02:58:13.381 --> 02:58:18.090
but the guy who was kind of the rules to stand back up then he a you.

2971
02:58:18.091 --> 02:58:21.270
Okay.
You put that in the MMA context.
That's why they're striking.

2972
02:58:21.271 --> 02:58:24.780
And MMA people say,
Oh,
let's say my,
whether it goes into MMA,

2973
02:58:24.781 --> 02:58:27.890
it'll knock everybody out if they stay standing.
I don't agree with that.

2974
02:58:27.891 --> 02:58:31.820
And that old man,
he'll get killed.
Even his legs,
not only the leg too.

2975
02:58:31.821 --> 02:58:35.780
I think even the,
the end that,
that uh,
like rent,
Ecuador beat by Victor Belfor.

2976
02:58:35.790 --> 02:58:39.390
Remember with the [inaudible] you say that in English,

2977
02:58:39.391 --> 02:58:43.980
like the boxing,
the dirty boxing,
boxing,
glitching is dif.

2978
02:58:44.070 --> 02:58:46.560
Very different.
Even the distance,

2979
02:58:47.400 --> 02:58:52.020
the timing with each has a small glove,
you know,
it changed everything for sure.

2980
02:58:52.110 --> 02:58:53.490
Then I spar,

2981
02:58:53.491 --> 02:58:58.310
I spar with much better decorated pure wrestler than me in,

2982
02:58:58.311 --> 02:59:01.800
in,
in MMA.
I put them all down.
Oh yeah.
All of them.

2983
02:59:02.330 --> 02:59:04.440
That because I'm better restaurants because my timing,

2984
02:59:04.441 --> 02:59:07.890
I learned from karate out to close the gap in karate,

2985
02:59:08.490 --> 02:59:13.350
but I use that,
I use a karate for the tech down.

2986
02:59:13.590 --> 02:59:17.370
Some use karate for a blitzing and like wonder boy she has,

2987
02:59:17.371 --> 02:59:19.680
depending how you use your tool,
you know what I mean?

2988
02:59:19.740 --> 02:59:22.740
What do you think about Wonderboy tilt?
That's this weekend.
Oh,
I love the man.

2989
02:59:22.741 --> 02:59:25.920
I got to watch his fights.
I think two things can happen.

2990
02:59:25.950 --> 02:59:29.370
How long are you going to be in town for a,
I leave on Friday.

2991
02:59:29.371 --> 02:59:33.540
I got to go back on Friday.
I'm questioning.
Gee,
yeah,
fights on Sunday.
It's here.

2992
02:59:33.630 --> 02:59:38.040
Yeah.
No,
it's an England.
But it's early March.
I'm going to do a fight companion.

2993
02:59:38.490 --> 02:59:41.400
Come in here and watch it.
I gotta,
I gotta.
I gotta have balance man.

2994
02:59:41.401 --> 02:59:44.490
And I wish I lost the receipt is because I really got to balance,

2995
02:59:44.850 --> 02:59:47.970
but they had this weekend.
I have some something important this weekend,

2996
02:59:47.980 --> 02:59:52.270
but then I need to be a much shoulder Saturday.
I would fights,

2997
02:59:52.920 --> 02:59:53.690
we'll do an internet,

2998
02:59:53.690 --> 02:59:57.000
that type of her like every night or watch fight with people that doesn't know

2999
02:59:57.001 --> 02:59:59.550
nothing about fight.
It's fucking for prisoners are fun.

3000
02:59:59.551 --> 03:00:01.430
We'd drink a couple beers,
watched the fight.

3001
03:00:01.600 --> 03:00:05.790
My fight companion are different than,
you know,
most of my friend are not really.

3002
03:00:05.810 --> 03:00:08.730
Fighters are like no more guys,
Geek geeks or whatever.
You know,

3003
03:00:09.400 --> 03:00:11.770
they think they know,
but they don't know that they get about fighters

3004
03:00:13.530 --> 03:00:17.610
the way they are freaking out.
I'd always,
and I've tried to be diplomatic.

3005
03:00:17.611 --> 03:00:21.230
I'm sitting here and everybody's like,
why you didn't do this white into now?

3006
03:00:22.720 --> 03:00:26.790
And I,
I used to try to correct them.
I used to,

3007
03:00:27.270 --> 03:00:31.700
but I put so much effort and energy that I just gave up.
I want point.
I'm like,

3008
03:00:35.950 --> 03:00:38.970
fight would live with wonder by people.
Like I was watching the fight.
He's like,

3009
03:00:39.270 --> 03:00:42.030
it's so boring I do it.

3010
03:00:42.031 --> 03:00:46.250
You just don't understand that with Wonderboy you go with one of the way and you

3011
03:00:46.251 --> 03:00:49.260
you,
you charge him like this.
He would.
You know what I mean?

3012
03:00:49.261 --> 03:00:50.320
Like I don't want to talk about,

3013
03:00:50.330 --> 03:00:53.430
he's my friend and I don't want to talk about for dare until if he listened to

3014
03:00:53.431 --> 03:00:56.210
this
round,

3015
03:00:57.120 --> 03:00:59.940
but they just don't freaking get it.
They don't understand.
They don't,

3016
03:00:59.950 --> 03:01:01.540
they're not educated about the,

3017
03:01:01.541 --> 03:01:03.790
the cultural like it's the same thing on the floor or there.

3018
03:01:03.791 --> 03:01:08.500
Why don't you do mood like and they have a few fights on the street.
That is,

3019
03:01:08.960 --> 03:01:13.060
it is funny though.
My boys man,
I like,
I liked it but a lot of them likes,

3020
03:01:13.070 --> 03:01:16.260
I was like,
man,
I listened.
Not all of them,
but some of them were like,
oh Geez,

3021
03:01:16.930 --> 03:01:20.830
is this is frustrating?
They take,
they know but they don't know man.

3022
03:01:21.700 --> 03:01:24.370
A lot of,
damn,
they think they know what they don't know why.
I said,

3023
03:01:24.371 --> 03:01:27.820
I love you guys,
but oh my God.
Going to be tied to oil.
You can,
you know.
Well,

3024
03:01:27.821 --> 03:01:30.640
this isn't George.
Let's wrap this up man.
Thank you for coming here.

3025
03:01:30.641 --> 03:01:33.580
I really appreciate it,
brother.
It's always great to say thank you man.
Thank you.

3026
03:01:33.720 --> 03:01:35.500
Is it the real time?
Real time.

3027
03:01:36.180 --> 03:01:40.370
<v 5>Shoot.
I used to hear us by,
yeah,
we did three hours.
Oh my God.</v>

3028
03:01:40.580 --> 03:01:44.420
Are you serious?
Yeah.
You sure can be the real time warp in here,
man.

3029
03:01:45.350 --> 03:01:48.080
Dude,
that's insane.
I need to beat the deck on today.
Let me check.

3030
03:01:48.110 --> 03:01:51.050
Where are you going to go?
I go to dad.
They contended with Freddie Roach.

3031
03:01:51.080 --> 03:01:53.240
What time does it take me there?
Yeah,
I'm checking that,

3032
03:01:53.241 --> 03:01:54.670
but you needed to train with me.
I need that.

3033
03:01:54.671 --> 03:01:57.290
I think I needed it to be there at four 30 before.

3034
03:01:58.100 --> 03:02:01.910
I think it closes at four 30 if you leave now,
you can be there by four 30 yeah,

3035
03:02:01.911 --> 03:02:04.370
but I missed that fricking back kick and structure and all that,

3036
03:02:04.470 --> 03:02:07.670
which I want to give you a quick one real quick.
Fuck.
That's fucking do it.

3037
03:02:07.671 --> 03:02:08.504
You don't mind

3038
03:02:09.900 --> 03:02:12.360
<v 6>buddy.
You don't mind.</v>
