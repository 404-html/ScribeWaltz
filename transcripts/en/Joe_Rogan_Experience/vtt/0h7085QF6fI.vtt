00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.080
<v Speaker 1>She's saying him there and we go live and then things are crackling and then</v>

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.060
<v Speaker 1>people are talking and everybody's listening.</v>

3
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.200
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:10.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>no one's Thomas.</v>

6
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.941
<v Speaker 1>What the sign?</v>

7
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:12.774
<v Speaker 1>We could just do it.</v>

8
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.053
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

9
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>So right now we're starting right now.</v>

10
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.153
<v Speaker 1>That's for a second.</v>

11
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.043
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

12
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight.</v>

17
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>You'll save yourself a little bit of money.</v>

18
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I used mine the other day,</v>

19
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.771
<v Speaker 1>they'd like to remember,</v>

20
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:44.360
<v Speaker 1>I told him,</v>

21
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>you said Tim for the podcast.</v>

22
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>I just was sitting in my man cave and I was like,</v>

23
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to fuck my flashlight.</v>

24
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

25
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.550
<v Speaker 1>And it just,</v>

26
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>I looked at it and it was just sitting there like,</v>

27
00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

28
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.181
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

29
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:55.014
<v Speaker 1>Like it was</v>

30
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.341
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

31
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:56.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:00:56.611 --> 00:00:57.444
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing,</v>

33
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>when you take it on like the road with you for a weekend,</v>

34
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>you feel like it's a whore.</v>

35
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Like when you take it on the road with you</v>

36
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>and just fuck it,</v>

37
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>like a Chechen hoard the bottom of a coal mine.</v>

38
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.960
<v Speaker 1>That was a great analogy.</v>

39
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.370
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

40
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>it's a little too good.</v>

41
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't think women are very comfortable with it.</v>

43
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a little too effective.</v>

44
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

45
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>this is just the beginning.</v>

46
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

47
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>technology's going to improve,</v>

48
00:01:21.661 --> 00:01:21.871
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>200 years ago we didn't have a car and now we have a flashlight.</v>

50
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.441
<v Speaker 1>What would it be?</v>

51
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>The technology of flashlight.</v>

52
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's a robot fuck doll?</v>

53
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

54
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.303
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

55
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Something that like acts like the hottest porn star alive,</v>

56
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>but only exists to fuck.</v>

57
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.741
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

58
00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 1>like you shut it off,</v>

59
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>but when you turn it on it looks like a person and it wants to fuck.</v>

60
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.071
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

61
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>it's really creepy to us,</v>

62
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>but we have to assume that we are,</v>

63
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>we're not a perfect being.</v>

64
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>The human beings not perfect.</v>

65
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:50.521
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

66
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not at all.</v>

67
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not done being involved.</v>

68
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 1>It's just a step along the way.</v>

69
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Just like monkeys were step along the way.</v>

70
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Just like turtles are a step along the way.</v>

71
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.131
<v Speaker 1>We're this,</v>

72
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>this thing is still trying to advance and improve.</v>

73
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

74
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>So you got to accept the fact that that's a part of the equation.</v>

75
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Part of the equation.</v>

76
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.860
<v Speaker 1>We've got duplicate,</v>

77
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.780
<v Speaker 1>I forgot this analogy was about Jackie.</v>

78
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>We're going to duplicate bodies,</v>

79
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>we're going to duplicate them and fuck them.</v>

80
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.230
<v Speaker 1>I need,</v>

81
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.471
<v Speaker 1>I need,</v>

82
00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I just sometimes you don't want all the extra hassle that comes with dealing</v>

83
00:02:21.751 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Speaker 1>with a person.</v>

84
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

85
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 1>just want to be able to get rid of some loads and if you could have like a fake</v>

86
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>person like that can even make out with you and stuff like a fake person.</v>

87
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 1>It's creepy though cause the idea is like well what is that?</v>

88
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:38.460
<v Speaker 1>This is blade runner and he's just fucking,</v>

89
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>is this like some sort of human slavery?</v>

90
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>

91
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>do you really wish you had a real person?</v>

92
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:45.840
<v Speaker 1>What if this inspires people to actually get real slaves?</v>

93
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

94
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.730
<v Speaker 1>and then they don't do to have that.</v>

95
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.550
<v Speaker 1>That guy had that girl trapped under his bed and he was married.</v>

96
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>He made her sleep under his bed.</v>

97
00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that thing?</v>

98
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.461
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

99
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Where was that?</v>

100
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Where the,</v>

101
00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.750
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck was that?</v>

102
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.810
<v Speaker 1>She was like 18.</v>

103
00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.070
<v Speaker 1>She could like go to the mall to me,</v>

104
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

105
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.490
<v Speaker 1>And then she under the bed and they just fucking did crazy shit to her.</v>

106
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I would that it's that.</v>

107
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>It's that Stockholm Syndrome.</v>

108
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.363
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

109
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Where you believe that your capture is helping you out?</v>

110
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 1>So I've been in relationships like that.</v>

111
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.430
<v Speaker 1>The robot Fucker,</v>

112
00:03:14.431 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll start off with a mouth and then like as technology gets better,</v>

113
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:17.811
<v Speaker 1>the mouth,</v>

114
00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>it gets smaller and smaller and smaller and they know the beat and no mouth.</v>

115
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Why would you say that?</v>

116
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Because she taught a big bright,</v>

117
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>not like blowjobs through some issues.</v>

118
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

119
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>we're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com makers of Alpha brain,</v>

120
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Trintech,</v>

121
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.731
<v Speaker 1>immune shroom,</v>

122
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:37.564
<v Speaker 1>tech sport,</v>

123
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>and a new mood.</v>

124
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.720
<v Speaker 1>All these things are nootropics and uh,</v>

125
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 1>the other ones are performance enhancing substances.</v>

126
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 1>What's the five HTP one?</v>

127
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.963
<v Speaker 1>It's whole new moon.</v>

128
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I swear by that 100% and you're talking to me about a guy that has obsessive</v>

129
00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>compulsive and anxiety issues.</v>

130
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I swear by that.</v>

131
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Speaker 1>When I start spiraling I go for that instead of Xanax.</v>

132
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>And that is a bold fucking statement.</v>

133
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Well it's legit man.</v>

134
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 1>What it does is it boosts your brain's ability to make serotonin.</v>

135
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.030
<v Speaker 1>It gives you the building blocks are serotonin and l Tryptophan converts to five</v>

136
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:10.031
<v Speaker 1>HTP,</v>

137
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 1>so that's in there as well.</v>

138
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>So it's gone a sort of a time release effect to it.</v>

139
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.790
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

140
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 1>it's a very effective supplement and it's,</v>

141
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 1>it's not something you have to worry about if you're,</v>

142
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>if you're fascinated by any of this stuff.</v>

143
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Speaker 1>But there are,</v>

144
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>what they are is called nootropics.</v>

145
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.120
<v Speaker 1>NOOTROPIC is n o t r o p,</v>

146
00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:31.121
<v Speaker 1>I c and Google that and read some information because it's a very controversial</v>

147
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:31.990
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>

148

<v Speaker 1>I bought,</v>

149
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I believe in nootropics.</v>

150
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer in vitamins and supplements and eating healthy and uh,</v>

151
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.050
<v Speaker 1>I have always been interested in taking the best fuel for my body.</v>

152
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 1>And my belief,</v>

153
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:47.380
<v Speaker 1>the best fuel for your brain has been mapped out.</v>

154
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

155
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 1>they're called nootropics.</v>

156
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>And Alpha brain is the best combination of these nootropics that we know how to</v>

157
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>

00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>We need like a cough button or some shit.</v>

162
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I didn't turn down my volume.</v>

163
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:08.373
<v Speaker 1>We</v>

<v Speaker 1>I have like a button though.</v>

167
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.230

171
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.163
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

172

<v Speaker 1>We should just have a signal like you point to me.</v>

173
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good idea.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's crazy man.</v>

336
00:09:34.951 --> 00:09:37.010
<v Speaker 1>When you just look out over the ocean,</v>

337
00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.450
<v Speaker 1>like their view that they have like,</v>

338
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.141
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

339
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:41.220
<v Speaker 1>especially in Rio,</v>

340
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm so,</v>

341
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.660
<v Speaker 1>they're like so connected to nature.</v>

342
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:46.801
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

343
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 1>Like they're completely connected to nature.</v>

344
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.441
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

345
00:09:49.441 --> 00:09:50.280
<v Speaker 1>you look at uh,</v>

346
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.680
<v Speaker 1>how Rio is with the favelas and the hills and the city at the bottom and the</v>

347
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.970
<v Speaker 1>ocean's right there and the way you look at it,</v>

348
00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:57.211
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

349
00:09:57.211 --> 00:09:57.510
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

350
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.590
<v Speaker 1>they're constantly reminded by nature.</v>

351
00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:01.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

352
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.440
<v Speaker 1>that's something that a lot of places in America just don't have.</v>

353
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:05.850
<v Speaker 1>New York doesn't really have that.</v>

354
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.090
<v Speaker 1>You see mostly buildings see mostly shift that we made.</v>

355
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 1>There's something about being in the presence of something like mountains and</v>

356
00:10:13.831 --> 00:10:16.320
<v Speaker 1>ocean where it just makes it go shit.</v>

357
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Or even just like wind,</v>

358
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.870
<v Speaker 1>like I went to the top of Mount Washington and the winds were like 110 miles an</v>

359
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:24.680
<v Speaker 1>hour and you were up there and you literally,</v>

360
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I met my heart,</v>

361
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:27.480
<v Speaker 1>sunk out of my asshole.</v>

362
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.051
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

363
00:10:28.051 --> 00:10:29.810
<v Speaker 1>I could be lifted off his mountain by God.</v>

364
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.570

366
00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:35.190
<v Speaker 1>sides of cliffs?</v>

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.160
<v Speaker 3>Holy Dallas.</v>

437
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.360
<v Speaker 3>Look at that fucking thing,</v>

438
00:12:32.361 --> 00:12:32.631
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

439
00:12:32.631 --> 00:12:34.130
<v Speaker 3>Area around,</v>

440
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.013
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

441
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.690
<v Speaker 3>the Mesquite area just to the west of mosquitoes.</v>

442
00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:43.010
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird that we're so like so nonchalant about these things about</v>

443
00:12:43.411 --> 00:12:45.330
<v Speaker 1>tornadoes and living in the,</v>

444
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.080
<v Speaker 1>just even the remote possibility that a tornado might hate your area.</v>

445
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Like shitting.</v>

446
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.990
<v Speaker 1>You factor that in to where you fucking live.</v>

447
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Everything you do,</v>

448
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:54.420
<v Speaker 1>that should be factored.</v>

449
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.060
<v Speaker 1>You should have definite escape plans into a seller.</v>

450
00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Like you shouldn't just be like,</v>

451
00:12:58.471 --> 00:12:58.741
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

452
00:12:58.741 --> 00:12:59.251
<v Speaker 1>if it comes,</v>

453
00:12:59.251 --> 00:13:00.084
<v Speaker 1>let's just hope.</v>

454
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that Joplin Missouri footage where they showed the before and</v>

455
00:13:04.651 --> 00:13:05.470
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>

456
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was Joplin,</v>

457
00:13:06.571 --> 00:13:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Missouri,</v>

458
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.840
<v Speaker 1>it was a town that was literally erased,</v>

459
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.700
<v Speaker 1>literally erased the Tornado's coming.</v>

460
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:13.291
<v Speaker 1>It's scary.</v>

461
00:13:13.291 --> 00:13:15.270
<v Speaker 1>Scary thing is they can come in the middle of the night,</v>

462
00:13:15.271 --> 00:13:15.950
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

463
00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:17.160
<v Speaker 1>they can come in the middle of the night.</v>

464
00:13:17.161 --> 00:13:18.810
<v Speaker 1>So you have to have like tornado warnings,</v>

465
00:13:18.811 --> 00:13:22.130
<v Speaker 1>so someone's gotta be paying attention and they got a blow horns and then you've</v>

466
00:13:22.131 --> 00:13:27.131
<v Speaker 1>got to get it in your basement while the monster made out a wind rips your house</v>

467
00:13:27.271 --> 00:13:28.104
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

468
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:28.351
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

469
00:13:28.351 --> 00:13:28.591
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

470
00:13:28.591 --> 00:13:32.670
<v Speaker 1>they had entire communities just vanished.</v>

471
00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:35.550
<v Speaker 1>They completely vanished down to the foundation.</v>

472
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.121
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

473
00:13:36.121 --> 00:13:38.000
<v Speaker 1>if that was a wind that was a,</v>

474
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.170
<v Speaker 1>a werewolf that was doing that.</v>

475
00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.190
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

476
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.351
<v Speaker 1>A bad wolf.</v>

477
00:13:42.351 --> 00:13:44.160
<v Speaker 1>The once a huff and puff and blow your house down,</v>

478
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:44.671
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

479
00:13:44.671 --> 00:13:46.200
<v Speaker 1>we gotta kill that fucking thing.</v>

480
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.540
<v Speaker 1>We've got to get away from where it lives.</v>

481
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.021
<v Speaker 1>We can't,</v>

482
00:13:49.021 --> 00:13:49.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

483
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.200
<v Speaker 1>but instead of it being aware of scape plan,</v>

484
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a wind monster.</v>

485
00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.260
<v Speaker 1>And we just sort of accept it.</v>

486
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.080
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

487
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:56.670
<v Speaker 1>you live,</v>

488
00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.770
<v Speaker 1>you live in the path of a fucking werewolf.</v>

489
00:13:58.890 --> 00:13:59.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a wind monster,</v>

490
00:13:59.851 --> 00:14:00.450
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

491
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a god.</v>

492
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.273
<v Speaker 1>It's Thor.</v>

493
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:03.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

494
00:14:03.151 --> 00:14:04.710
<v Speaker 1>it's ripping houses a pie.</v>

495
00:14:04.711 --> 00:14:05.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a god.</v>

496
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

497
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.310
<v Speaker 1>no wonder why is storms.</v>

498
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

499
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:09.111
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

500
00:14:09.111 --> 00:14:11.190
<v Speaker 1>when you know people were savages,</v>

501
00:14:11.191 --> 00:14:13.530
<v Speaker 1>they thought it was the anger of the gods.</v>

502
00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:14.160
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

503
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:15.120
<v Speaker 1>No wonder why.</v>

504
00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine?</v>

505
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:16.651
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where.</v>

506
00:14:16.651 --> 00:14:18.990
<v Speaker 1>It's still something like Katrina,</v>

507
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.640
<v Speaker 1>where you don't know when it's coming.</v>

508
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.000
<v Speaker 1>You both,</v>

509
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.833
<v Speaker 1>maybe it is,</v>

510
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a reaction.</v>

511
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a reaction to what's being disrespectful.</v>

512
00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:26.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

513
00:14:26.221 --> 00:14:28.920
<v Speaker 1>it's maybe reaction just to the biological,</v>

514
00:14:28.921 --> 00:14:30.970
<v Speaker 1>the sheer size of the,</v>

515
00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:33.240
<v Speaker 1>the biological entities of the human race.</v>

516
00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:33.751
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

517
00:14:33.751 --> 00:14:37.380
<v Speaker 1>the massive amount of waste that we put out and if that makes it global warming</v>

518
00:14:37.381 --> 00:14:40.140
<v Speaker 1>and if that really does pick up the intensity of storms,</v>

519
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:41.640
<v Speaker 1>I know all that Shit's debated.</v>

520
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true or not.</v>

521
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:43.591
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not,</v>

522
00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:44.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

523
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:47.190
<v Speaker 1>people have tried to make that connection between human beings,</v>

524
00:14:47.191 --> 00:14:51.120
<v Speaker 1>global warming and the acceleration of these big storms,</v>

525
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.920
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know where the status of that is,</v>

526
00:14:52.921 --> 00:14:54.560
<v Speaker 1>so I don't want to speak to that,</v>

527
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:56.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's negative energy all collected.</v>

528
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:57.340
<v Speaker 1>But what,</v>

529
00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:57.550
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>

530
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:58.430
<v Speaker 1>where would it be if that's,</v>

531
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:01.940
<v Speaker 1>if we found out it was true that we found out that once people get to certain</v>

532
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:02.930
<v Speaker 1>fever pitch,</v>

533
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:03.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

534
00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:04.740
<v Speaker 1>the earth just has a,</v>

535
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.760
<v Speaker 1>a response of these big gusts of wind monsters to sorta like shut everybody the</v>

536
00:15:09.801 --> 00:15:10.634
<v Speaker 1>fuck up.</v>

537
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Why is it so fucking warm over here?</v>

538
00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.390
<v Speaker 2>If we were all hippies and it just be sunny every day</v>

539
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:16.880
<v Speaker 1>where sunny and beautiful.</v>

540
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Did you imagine that?</v>

541
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.741
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

542
00:15:18.741 --> 00:15:23.741
<v Speaker 1>It's like God's death squad is a tornado is God just sends them down every now</v>

543
00:15:24.621 --> 00:15:24.981
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

544
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:27.170
<v Speaker 1>please get these cuffs off my planet.</v>

545
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:28.100
<v Speaker 1>And you're just here,</v>

546
00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Jo Cox are,</v>

547
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.450
<v Speaker 1>it's just a thing where you know God created people,</v>

548
00:15:32.451 --> 00:15:37.451
<v Speaker 1>but people just figured out how to get way too good at some shit way too</v>

549
00:15:38.091 --> 00:15:38.924
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

550
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's the race between it nature trying to squash us and US trying to</v>

551
00:15:43.071 --> 00:15:44.600
<v Speaker 1>transcend being human.</v>

552
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.510
<v Speaker 1>I feel fucking bizarre concept.</v>

553
00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.320
<v Speaker 1>It's the race.</v>

554
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.370
<v Speaker 1>It's the race right now.</v>

555
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:50.571
<v Speaker 1>That's the rice.</v>

556
00:15:50.571 --> 00:15:55.100
<v Speaker 1>It's between us coming up with some sort of technology that lists us,</v>

557
00:15:55.430 --> 00:16:00.430
<v Speaker 1>lifts us out of our monkey existence or the to or swallowing us up in a super</v>

558
00:16:00.631 --> 00:16:01.464
<v Speaker 1>volcano.</v>

559
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:03.350
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

560
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.460
<v Speaker 1>That's some good champagne.</v>

561
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.500
<v Speaker 1>It was a great champagne.</v>

562
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.450
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking new.</v>

563
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Celebrating.</v>

564
00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.090
<v Speaker 1>They're celebrating.</v>

565
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:08.541
<v Speaker 1>Hold on,</v>

566
00:16:08.541 --> 00:16:08.841
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

567
00:16:08.841 --> 00:16:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Let's wrap this up because I'm a little,</v>

568
00:16:10.071 --> 00:16:11.200
<v Speaker 1>my mind's a little fucking blown.</v>

569
00:16:11.201 --> 00:16:12.034
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

570
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.400
<v Speaker 1>That fucking concept is like is it was bizarre.</v>

571
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.500
<v Speaker 1>The fucking God is just,</v>

572
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.060
<v Speaker 1>it's that ridiculous.</v>

573
00:16:20.061 --> 00:16:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

574
00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:21.173
<v Speaker 1>It's just weather.</v>

575
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.153
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

576
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.761
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

577
00:16:23.761 --> 00:16:27.010
<v Speaker 2>so the reason I'm say it,</v>

578
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.943
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

579
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.760
<v Speaker 1>the system and if like you know certain things got too high,</v>

580
00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:35.630
<v Speaker 1>like human waste of human waste cause a certain amount of disease which it does,</v>

581
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.050
<v Speaker 1>you know things where we fuck things up cause a certain amount of debt.</v>

582
00:16:39.051 --> 00:16:43.150
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like cancer with Saks you lost me fellow.</v>

583
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

584
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.980
<v Speaker 2>If you have sex then that's the planet's way of getting back.</v>

585
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.210
<v Speaker 2>Like stop having sex.</v>

586
00:16:49.211 --> 00:16:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Then did you read the fucking Bible and we're going to make cancer.</v>

587
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.620
<v Speaker 2>So if you stop having never mind,</v>

588
00:16:53.621 --> 00:16:54.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about,</v>

589
00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:58.091
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

590
00:16:58.091 --> 00:17:01.720
<v Speaker 2>I think I kind of like what if it was connected cancer,</v>

591
00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.420
<v Speaker 2>the worst thing in the real connected with the best thing in the world.</v>

592
00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like the same kind of Carmen.</v>

593
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:11.170
<v Speaker 2>We'll see what happens when you get high is that the eye is what I think is that</v>

594
00:17:11.171 --> 00:17:12.880
<v Speaker 2>you have a paragraph in your head.</v>

595
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.320
<v Speaker 2>It's very well thought out,</v>

596
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.310
<v Speaker 2>but all you can piece together like five words out of that paragraph and your</v>

597
00:17:18.311 --> 00:17:20.500
<v Speaker 2>brain's scrambled and picks the five best ones.</v>

598
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.140
<v Speaker 2>And the worst is when you're halfway into the paragraph and go,</v>

599
00:17:23.141 --> 00:17:23.974
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

600
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:25.343
<v Speaker 2>Talking about</v>

601
00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.533
<v Speaker 2>it is the worst</v>

602
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:29.660
<v Speaker 2>that out.</v>

603
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.670
<v Speaker 2>If it was a normal thing,</v>

604
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.190
<v Speaker 2>oh you know how awesome I would look.</v>

605
00:17:36.191 --> 00:17:39.250
<v Speaker 2>And then you would look and we would all look at the edited all these things and</v>

606
00:17:39.251 --> 00:17:44.251
<v Speaker 2>like our [inaudible] friends,</v>

607
00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.000
<v Speaker 2>I give an that.</v>

608
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking those best of the Brian Clips on Youtube.</v>

609
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.971
<v Speaker 2>They made me laugh.</v>

610
00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:54.270
<v Speaker 2>So fucking hard.</v>

611
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:57.900
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's something I'm very similar to Brian and a lot of ways is that</v>

612
00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:58.650
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

613
00:17:58.650 --> 00:17:59.970
<v Speaker 2>I think we're both very childish.</v>

614
00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Both have their child heart.</v>

615
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.160
<v Speaker 2>And so I hear some of these things and I can tell when he's trying to be funny.</v>

616
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:06.570
<v Speaker 2>I can tell he's trying to be serious.</v>

617
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.560
<v Speaker 2>I fucking laughed in a hotel room bed for an hour,</v>

618
00:18:10.561 --> 00:18:12.030
<v Speaker 2>just watching it over and over again.</v>

619
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.210
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty ridiculous.</v>

620
00:18:15.211 --> 00:18:17.820
<v Speaker 2>Which you call out all the best moments,</v>

621
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.590
<v Speaker 2>you know the best.</v>

622
00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:20.940
<v Speaker 2>My favorite one is when he goes,</v>

623
00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:22.620
<v Speaker 2>my dad has magic glasses,</v>

624
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.530
<v Speaker 2>you can one can see up close in one.</v>

625
00:18:25.531 --> 00:18:26.120
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm,</v>

626
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm listening and I go,</v>

627
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:29.330
<v Speaker 2>they're called bifocals ass judgment.</v>

628
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:30.480
<v Speaker 2>Franklin had their own business.</v>

629
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.060
<v Speaker 2>My Dad only has back in Ohio,</v>

630
00:18:33.061 --> 00:18:36.810
<v Speaker 2>bought one of those things where it's a belt that goes around really,</v>

631
00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:40.170
<v Speaker 2>really fast and it has like these metal prongs that,</v>

632
00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.360
<v Speaker 2>that I just hover over the belt,</v>

633
00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:43.740
<v Speaker 2>the rubber belts,</v>

634
00:18:43.741 --> 00:18:48.570
<v Speaker 2>so in it collects electricity and then you put this little dome on it and the</v>

635
00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:51.740
<v Speaker 2>electricity then collects inside the dome and it gets off.</v>

636
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 20,000 volts of electricity it makes or something like that quiz.</v>

637
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.300
<v Speaker 2>And so he's showing this to me and he's like,</v>

638
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:00.900
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

642
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:04.201

707
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.880
<v Speaker 2>I only got to see him one night.</v>

708
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.350
<v Speaker 2>And he was hanging out with us having us.</v>

709
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:37.541
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

00:20:37.541 --> 00:20:38.430
<v Speaker 2>he likes to drink,</v>

711
00:20:38.431 --> 00:20:39.510
<v Speaker 2>he likes to have a couple of drinks,</v>

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:40.403
<v Speaker 2>have a cocktail.</v>

713
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

714
00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:42.180
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:42.960
<v Speaker 2>He was having fun.</v>

716
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.171
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

717
00:20:43.171 --> 00:20:45.570
<v Speaker 2>so we were all sitting around and I think you are,</v>

718
00:20:45.571 --> 00:20:46.920

<v Speaker 2>huge champagne bottle.</v>

721
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:51.940
<v Speaker 2>It looked like a champagne bottle,</v>

722
00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 2>but it was a pop soda pop.</v>

723
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.740
<v Speaker 2>And so I poured a glass and Katie podcast and I was like,</v>

729
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:01.840

735
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:05.740
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

736

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

738
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.121
<v Speaker 2>it started off with,</v>

739
00:21:07.121 --> 00:21:07.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

740
00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:07.871
<v Speaker 2>my dad was just,</v>

741
00:21:07.871 --> 00:21:08.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

742
00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.280
<v Speaker 2>talking like he usually does,</v>

743
00:21:09.281 --> 00:21:09.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

744
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:10.600
<v Speaker 2>about how to,</v>

745
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.943
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

746
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:14.260
<v Speaker 2>break perpetual motion or whatever he always talks about.</v>

747
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.310
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

748
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

749
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.430
<v Speaker 2>then he just became giggly and happy and he,</v>

750
00:21:18.431 --> 00:21:20.890
<v Speaker 2>it was just like shitty grin the whole time.</v>

751
00:21:20.891 --> 00:21:21.400
<v Speaker 2>It's so great.</v>

752
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't you tell him about this?</v>

753
00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:23.763
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

754
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.910
<v Speaker 2>I guess it is like a big yeah,</v>

755
00:21:25.911 --> 00:21:27.210
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like he enjoyed it.</v>

756
00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:27.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

757

<v Speaker 2>he was a real job.</v>

761
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:31.480
<v Speaker 2>He would've got drug tested.</v>

762
00:21:31.481 --> 00:21:31.840
<v Speaker 2>I would've,</v>

763
00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.280
<v Speaker 2>he would've got fired from his job.</v>

764
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.100
<v Speaker 2>He gets drug test.</v>

772
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.063
<v Speaker 2>I could never do it.</v>

773
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.993

<v Speaker 2>I know I will.</v>

778
00:21:54.491 --> 00:21:55.324

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.970
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine my life like five years I've told me so crazy,</v>

782
00:22:03.971 --> 00:22:04.510

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.040
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell him so I could videotape it.</v>

788
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.110
<v Speaker 2>What the Fuck did you dad do to when you were young that you want to torture him</v>

789
00:22:20.111 --> 00:22:20.800
<v Speaker 2>like this?</v>

790
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:25.210
<v Speaker 2>He made me look at the his inventions and machines you've dealt with hours and</v>

791
00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:25.780
<v Speaker 2>hours on end.</v>

792
00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.160
<v Speaker 2>I just sat there and watched.</v>

793
00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:27.850
<v Speaker 2>That's what we did.</v>

794
00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Wires like there's,</v>

795
00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:32.160
<v Speaker 2>there's a picture of me like on a old school computer on,</v>

796
00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.380
<v Speaker 2>have you ever seen me tweeted or whatever and I'm just like playing on this old</v>

797
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:36.820
<v Speaker 2>like I don't know what it was.</v>

798
00:22:36.821 --> 00:22:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Machine.</v>

799
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's pretty much what I did.</v>

800
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:43.450
<v Speaker 2>Like every night I would go downstairs and watch my dad tried to invent crazy</v>

801
00:22:43.451 --> 00:22:45.580
<v Speaker 2>shit and fix things.</v>

802
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Like he's one of those guys that you could give him anything and he would fix</v>

803
00:22:48.791 --> 00:22:48.910
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

804
00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:49.820
<v Speaker 2>Like anything.</v>

805
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Like you give them a TV,</v>

806
00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.540
<v Speaker 2>you give him a fucking car,</v>

807
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:55.030
<v Speaker 2>he'll take apart the car and figuring out what's wrong with him.</v>

808
00:22:55.031 --> 00:22:55.631
<v Speaker 2>Rebuild.</v>

809
00:22:55.631 --> 00:22:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Like if that part isn't made anymore,</v>

810
00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:58.780
<v Speaker 2>he would build that part.</v>

811
00:22:58.781 --> 00:23:00.950
<v Speaker 2>And what's crazy sounds like your dad Mike.</v>

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.800
<v Speaker 2>To be a fun drug for your dad.</v>

815
00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:05.634
<v Speaker 2>He got Adderall.</v>

816
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:07.683
<v Speaker 2>Adderall.</v>

817
00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Close some shit down.</v>

818
00:23:10.781 --> 00:23:11.614
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

819
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.880
<v Speaker 2>Works like I love those lights.</v>

820
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Dude got in the Adderall and went on a rage.</v>

821
00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:18.940
<v Speaker 2>Who did?</v>

822
00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:19.291
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

823
00:23:19.291 --> 00:23:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

824
00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:21.850
<v Speaker 2>What other luck on the Adderall rates actually have?</v>

825
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:24.010
<v Speaker 2>My Dad's showing his computer machine.</v>

826
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:25.180
<v Speaker 2>You could hear how he talks.</v>

827
00:23:25.181 --> 00:23:26.050
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy.</v>

828
00:23:26.051 --> 00:23:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Love to hear.</v>

829
00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:27.011
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

830
00:23:27.011 --> 00:23:27.191
<v Speaker 2>let's,</v>

831
00:23:27.191 --> 00:23:29.620
<v Speaker 2>let's listen to my dad talk about it.</v>

832
00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:35.250
<v Speaker 2>This is him going into his workshop explaining his electricity machine or when</v>

833
00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.480
<v Speaker 2>should you be giving this stuff out on the air?</v>

834
00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:38.021
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

835
00:23:38.021 --> 00:23:40.120
<v Speaker 2>is this like a patent or anything that your dad</v>

836
00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.960
<v Speaker 2>generator now this hammer still shocked.</v>

837
00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:48.940
<v Speaker 2>So I use this one going,</v>

838
00:23:48.941 --> 00:23:49.774
<v Speaker 2>I buy their handle.</v>

839
00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:52.040
<v Speaker 2>Anything sharp like this.</v>

840
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:54.800
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't spark to it like a lightning rod,</v>

841
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:55.663
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

842
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Can we turn the light off?</v>

843
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.940
<v Speaker 2>I think it will probably work in the dark.</v>

844
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:01.120
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

845
00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

846
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 2>I was like Mister Science.</v>

847
00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

848
00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.910
<v Speaker 2>You have to get your eyes used to the car.</v>

849
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.400
<v Speaker 2>It was so scary because you can't see in the video,</v>

850
00:24:12.401 --> 00:24:14.730
<v Speaker 2>but there's like blue light sparkling in there.</v>

851
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.460
<v Speaker 2>See the glow come over to the hammer.</v>

852
00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

853
00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:23.671

855
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.570

856
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:28.463
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

860
00:24:32.371 --> 00:24:33.300

861
00:24:33.301 --> 00:24:33.570

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:27.800
<v Speaker 5>You ever met like the children of singers who can just naturally sing?</v>

00:25:30.891 --> 00:25:33.560
<v Speaker 5>like I genuinely say my kids are naturally funny.</v>

915
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:34.370
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

916
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.581
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

917
00:25:34.581 --> 00:25:35.450
<v Speaker 5>100%.</v>

918
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:38.060
<v Speaker 5>Like my kids are like,</v>

919
00:25:38.061 --> 00:25:39.680
<v Speaker 5>they make other people laugh.</v>

920
00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:40.281
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

921
00:25:40.281 --> 00:25:40.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

922
00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:41.450
<v Speaker 5>like how old are your kids?</v>

923
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:42.350
<v Speaker 5>Five and seven.</v>

924
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.480
<v Speaker 5>And they're fucking funny.</v>

925
00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:44.901
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

926
00:25:44.901 --> 00:25:48.260
<v Speaker 5>think it's from being around you been around a comic or do you think it's</v>

927
00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.273
<v Speaker 5>genetic?</v>

928
00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:50.061
<v Speaker 5>I think two things.</v>

929
00:25:50.061 --> 00:25:53.840
<v Speaker 5>I think one is being around me and I'm co I'm constantly lighthearted and I will</v>

930
00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:55.220
<v Speaker 5>always fucking,</v>

931
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:58.400
<v Speaker 5>my goal for everything is laughter about everything.</v>

932
00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:01.430
<v Speaker 5>And then I think also that I have a group of friends that run through my house</v>

933
00:26:01.431 --> 00:26:04.880
<v Speaker 5>and my kids had been around and they try to make them laugh.</v>

934
00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:06.730
<v Speaker 5>And I think that that takes up to the,</v>

935
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:06.981
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

936
00:26:06.981 --> 00:26:07.191
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

937
00:26:07.191 --> 00:26:07.460
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

938
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.740
<v Speaker 5>if you're sitting in the Baptist church and nothing has happened to people at</v>

939
00:26:09.741 --> 00:26:09.891
<v Speaker 5>all,</v>

940
00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:11.180
<v Speaker 5>but if you're sitting in a Baptist church,</v>

941
00:26:11.181 --> 00:26:12.590
<v Speaker 5>you're trying to make the baptist preacher lap,</v>

942
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:13.431
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty easy laugh.</v>

943
00:26:13.431 --> 00:26:14.310
<v Speaker 5>You don't really eat,</v>

944
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:14.991
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

945
00:26:14.991 --> 00:26:15.740
<v Speaker 5>isn't that right?</v>

946
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:16.670
<v Speaker 5>Good job like it.</v>

947
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.700
<v Speaker 5>But it's not like a cultivated like sense of humor.</v>

948
00:26:19.701 --> 00:26:22.730
<v Speaker 5>But when you got Thompson gorilla sitting on the couch and he's drinking beers</v>

949
00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.140
<v Speaker 5>and my kids are trying to make them laugh,</v>

950
00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.830
<v Speaker 5>they come up with some funny fucking my daughter.</v>

951
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:27.000
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

952
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:27.350
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

953
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:31.040
<v Speaker 5>this is going to sound like a lie because I'm just telling you this yesterday.</v>

954
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.680
<v Speaker 5>This is maybe the hardest I've ever laughed at.</v>

955
00:26:33.681 --> 00:26:34.514
<v Speaker 5>My youngest daughter,</v>

956
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:39.170
<v Speaker 5>my wife was trying to brag on the fact that her and my youngest daughter who</v>

957
00:26:39.171 --> 00:26:41.210
<v Speaker 5>were having problems with developmental leave,</v>

958
00:26:41.211 --> 00:26:42.200
<v Speaker 5>she's not retarded.</v>

959
00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 5>But that sounds horrible to fuck.</v>

960
00:26:43.981 --> 00:26:45.900
<v Speaker 5>I shouldn't be talking because she's not,</v>

961
00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:46.734
<v Speaker 5>she's not.</v>

962
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:49.680

963
00:26:49.681 --> 00:26:51.720
<v Speaker 5>she's a a very wild kid.</v>

964
00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:52.770
<v Speaker 5>She's a spirited child.</v>

965
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:53.400
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

966
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.920
<v Speaker 5>So my wife's trying to brag on her to a stranger.</v>

967
00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:57.720

1016
00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.420
<v Speaker 6>It's so foolish.</v>

1017
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:05.010
<v Speaker 6>The idea that you're going to exclude certain words and that somehow or another,</v>

1018
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 6>this excluding of certain words is going to make people behave differently.</v>

1019
00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:14.340
<v Speaker 6>Is it really are going to be comments is what it is.</v>

1020
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:20.440
<v Speaker 6>You can't change things by removing Fox and you know like if a little kid say</v>

1021
00:28:21.211 --> 00:28:21.541
<v Speaker 6>fuck,</v>

1022
00:28:21.541 --> 00:28:23.210
<v Speaker 6>it's funny what it was it,</v>

1023
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.113
<v Speaker 6>it's really bad.</v>

1024
00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:24.781
<v Speaker 6>It's bad.</v>

1025
00:28:24.781 --> 00:28:25.830
<v Speaker 6>If you over fuck,</v>

1026
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:26.281
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1027
00:28:26.281 --> 00:28:28.830
<v Speaker 6>if you're talking to him guys like this fucking guy with his fucking thing till</v>

1028
00:28:28.831 --> 00:28:29.664
<v Speaker 6>the fucking,</v>

1029
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.750
<v Speaker 6>after awhile you're like,</v>

1030
00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:31.350
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

1031
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:32.520
<v Speaker 6>you're killing my head.</v>

1032
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.980
<v Speaker 6>Like the way you're communicating is bizarre.</v>

1033
00:28:34.981 --> 00:28:35.814
<v Speaker 6>It's not,</v>

1034
00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.170
<v Speaker 6>it's not comfortable.</v>

1035
00:28:37.171 --> 00:28:40.220
<v Speaker 6>I'm not receiving your information very comfortably but,</v>

1036
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:45.060
<v Speaker 6>but just the occasional use of the word that you want to use in the right place.</v>

1037
00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:46.980
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's a reason why those words exist.</v>

1038
00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.810
<v Speaker 6>Just because some folks aren't that good at using all the colors to paint with.</v>

1039
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.000
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't mean that those boards should be excluded.</v>

1040
00:28:54.001 --> 00:28:57.750
<v Speaker 6>So I always get offended when people say that their kids shouldn't swear.</v>

1041
00:28:58.650 --> 00:28:58.891
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

1042
00:28:58.891 --> 00:28:59.724
<v Speaker 6>really?</v>

1043
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.713
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>

1044
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.100
<v Speaker 6>When is this going to stop?</v>

1045
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.070
<v Speaker 6>What is this nonsense of bad words going to stop?</v>

1046
00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:05.291
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1047
00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:09.000
<v Speaker 6>if he started off young then that it would never be a big deal.</v>

1048
00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.810
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

1049
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:10.530
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

1050
00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:12.720
<v Speaker 6>Like if there's a reason why in European countries,</v>

1051
00:29:12.721 --> 00:29:14.880
<v Speaker 6>a lot of kids get to drink and smoke house.</v>

1052
00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.710
<v Speaker 5>I was just in Italy and they were talking about this.</v>

1053
00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:18.520
<v Speaker 5>All the kids,</v>

1054
00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:19.101
<v Speaker 5>all of them were like,</v>

1055
00:29:19.101 --> 00:29:19.190
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1056
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:20.110
<v Speaker 5>it's not a big deal in our house.</v>

1057
00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.130
<v Speaker 5>I got up wine if I want,</v>

1058
00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.660
<v Speaker 5>so why would I care about getting fucked up?</v>

1059
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.730
<v Speaker 6>They don't have as many issues.</v>

1060
00:29:23.731 --> 00:29:26.880
<v Speaker 6>I think a lot of our issues with things that people have like as far as</v>

1061
00:29:26.881 --> 00:29:28.710
<v Speaker 6>obsessive compulsive issues or,</v>

1062
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.630
<v Speaker 6>or a addictive issues,</v>

1063
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:33.510
<v Speaker 6>I think it's just a little game that your brain plays when you can't get</v>

1064
00:29:33.511 --> 00:29:33.901
<v Speaker 6>something.</v>

1065
00:29:33.901 --> 00:29:36.040
<v Speaker 6>Then he'd get it and he shouldn't have it and then you want it.</v>

1066
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.590
<v Speaker 6>I think it's just this weird seesaw thing that your brain can play and that and</v>

1067
00:29:40.591 --> 00:29:45.040
<v Speaker 6>part that one of the triggers of that is suppressing people.</v>

1068
00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:46.200
<v Speaker 6>So look,</v>

1069
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:47.680
<v Speaker 6>when we all know this,</v>

1070
00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:49.120
<v Speaker 6>we all knew this growing up.</v>

1071
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.100
<v Speaker 6>Who were the sluttiest girls?</v>

1072
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:52.510
<v Speaker 6>Catholic school girl.</v>

1073
00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:53.773
<v Speaker 6>I say black.</v>

1074
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.110
<v Speaker 5>When I was growing up</v>

1075
00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.070
<v Speaker 6>that actually had to go to the Catholic school.</v>

1076
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:07.450
<v Speaker 6>They had to go to like all girls schools be academy was where our roles when</v>

1077
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.670
<v Speaker 6>they suppressed the shit out of these girls,</v>

1078
00:30:09.671 --> 00:30:10.031
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1079
00:30:10.031 --> 00:30:13.750
<v Speaker 6>they made them wear these little dresses and they told him to stay away from</v>

1080
00:30:13.751 --> 00:30:14.350
<v Speaker 6>boys.</v>

1081
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:18.070
<v Speaker 6>And I remember I dated two different girls that went to Catholic school and they</v>

1082
00:30:18.071 --> 00:30:20.790
<v Speaker 6>were both fucking free like,</v>

1083
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:21.910
<v Speaker 6>and when you're that age,</v>

1084
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:23.530
<v Speaker 6>when you get introduced to a freak,</v>

1085
00:30:23.531 --> 00:30:25.510
<v Speaker 6>that way it blows your fucking mind.</v>

1086
00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:29.020
<v Speaker 6>They just couldn't wait to get ahold of some Dick because they were just told to</v>

1087
00:30:29.021 --> 00:30:29.471
<v Speaker 6>stay away,</v>

1088
00:30:29.471 --> 00:30:29.921
<v Speaker 6>stay away,</v>

1089
00:30:29.921 --> 00:30:30.460
<v Speaker 6>stay away.</v>

1090
00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.010
<v Speaker 6>I didn't realize what they're creating and those women.</v>

1091
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.150
<v Speaker 6>And plus it's like those,</v>

1092
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:36.040
<v Speaker 6>it's still the savage blood lines.</v>

1093
00:30:36.041 --> 00:30:40.090
<v Speaker 6>It's all Irish and Italian and all these people in the,</v>

1094
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:41.140
<v Speaker 6>in the Catholic school that's,</v>

1095
00:30:41.141 --> 00:30:42.520
<v Speaker 6>those are savage bloodlines,</v>

1096
00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:42.820
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1097
00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:43.870
<v Speaker 6>Those are blood lines of,</v>

1098
00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:44.410
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1099
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.530
<v Speaker 6>people that have been cutting people with swords for thousands of years.</v>

1100
00:30:47.531 --> 00:30:47.950
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1101
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:48.280
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

1102
00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.190
<v Speaker 6>it's an old European Cuban that was all Catholic.</v>

1103
00:30:51.191 --> 00:30:52.270
<v Speaker 6>Girls' schools were Cuban.</v>

1104
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:54.310
<v Speaker 6>Can I keep them away from Dick too?</v>

1105
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:55.420
<v Speaker 6>I remember this chick,</v>

1106
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.590
<v Speaker 6>this chick Shannon,</v>

1107
00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.660
<v Speaker 6>ninth grade start dating her.</v>

1108
00:30:58.661 --> 00:30:59.291
<v Speaker 6>I go to her house,</v>

1109
00:30:59.291 --> 00:31:01.660
<v Speaker 6>Catholic from academy and we'd go to,</v>

1110
00:31:01.661 --> 00:31:02.740
<v Speaker 6>I go to her house for a date,</v>

1111
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.110
<v Speaker 6>like to hang out in her dad won't let her fucking leave.</v>

1112
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:05.861
<v Speaker 6>So she goes,</v>

1113
00:31:05.861 --> 00:31:05.981
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1114
00:31:05.981 --> 00:31:07.840
<v Speaker 6>we were just sitting here down and watch a movie and he goes,</v>

1115
00:31:07.841 --> 00:31:07.931
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

1116
00:31:07.931 --> 00:31:09.940
<v Speaker 6>I'll be in the kitchen like a wall away,</v>

1117
00:31:09.941 --> 00:31:11.410
<v Speaker 6>right second he gets to there,</v>

1118
00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:12.581
<v Speaker 6>she grabs my hand,</v>

1119
00:31:12.581 --> 00:31:14.150
<v Speaker 6>starts sucking my fingers and I</v>

1120
00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:16.050
<v Speaker 5>came with my peers</v>

1121
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.840
<v Speaker 5>because I was fucking jacking off until then,</v>

1122
00:31:26.841 --> 00:31:30.680
<v Speaker 5>I had no concept and I remember I made the mistake of telling everyone at</v>

1123
00:31:30.681 --> 00:31:31.514
<v Speaker 5>school,</v>

1124
00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.480
<v Speaker 5>I'll never forget.</v>

1125
00:31:35.481 --> 00:31:38.840
<v Speaker 5>I showed up and they told ty Rodriguez and tired and I sat down for lunch and</v>

1126
00:31:38.841 --> 00:31:39.231
<v Speaker 5>ties like,</v>

1127
00:31:39.231 --> 00:31:40.130

1130
00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.460

1131
00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.070
<v Speaker 5>you have to defend that in a weird way too fucking,</v>

1156
00:32:32.831 --> 00:32:33.664
<v Speaker 5>It was high.</v>

1157
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:39.710
<v Speaker 5>It was like baby while I know you're fucking finger nails not clean.</v>

1158
00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:40.281
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1159
00:32:40.281 --> 00:32:43.460
<v Speaker 2>she made them clean so that if you look at mine,</v>

1160
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.860
<v Speaker 2>if you look at my phone and it's always the cleanest one.</v>

1161
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:55.570
<v Speaker 2>And then sometimes like we would drink cranberry vodkas or whatever and like I</v>

1162
00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.340
<v Speaker 2>would have like a stain thumb and it was kind of embarrassed because you can't</v>

1163
00:32:58.341 --> 00:33:01.280
<v Speaker 2>really wash the stain of the cranberry off of your thumb.</v>

1164
00:33:01.281 --> 00:33:03.230
<v Speaker 2>So he would walk around with a red thumb.</v>

1165
00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:03.881
<v Speaker 2>We know.</v>

1166
00:33:03.881 --> 00:33:04.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1167
00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:04.670
<v Speaker 2>do you know,</v>

1168
00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1169
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:07.010
<v Speaker 6>that Guy Julian Assan from wikileaks,</v>

1170
00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:08.140
<v Speaker 6>they got it's in trouble.</v>

1171
00:33:08.141 --> 00:33:11.770
<v Speaker 6>And is they do want to export it to be honest with sexual assault,</v>

1172
00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:13.330
<v Speaker 6>the League says by,</v>

1173
00:33:13.331 --> 00:33:13.511
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1174
00:33:13.511 --> 00:33:14.170
<v Speaker 6>the story,</v>

1175
00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:18.220
<v Speaker 6>I don't know any of the really crazy this guy released all these documents,</v>

1176
00:33:18.221 --> 00:33:19.480
<v Speaker 6>but what they're getting them on,</v>

1177
00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:20.050
<v Speaker 6>what they're,</v>

1178
00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:23.620
<v Speaker 6>they're prosecuting them on is having sex with a girl.</v>

1179
00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:28.480
<v Speaker 6>He had sex with a girl with a condom on and then while they were sleeping</v>

1180
00:33:28.481 --> 00:33:29.314
<v Speaker 6>together,</v>

1181
00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.850
<v Speaker 6>he apparently stuck it in without a condom and was fucking her without a condom.</v>

1182
00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.980
<v Speaker 6>And she charged him.</v>

1183
00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:39.010
<v Speaker 6>It's like sexual surprise or a surprise sex.</v>

1184
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:39.971
<v Speaker 6>Like for real,</v>

1185
00:33:39.971 --> 00:33:41.260
<v Speaker 6>it's not a real thing.</v>

1186
00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:41.700
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1187
00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:42.161
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1188
00:33:42.161 --> 00:33:42.491
<v Speaker 6>I'm not,</v>

1189
00:33:42.491 --> 00:33:43.420
<v Speaker 6>I'm not even joking.</v>

1190
00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.280
<v Speaker 6>And this is like literally why they're,</v>

1191
00:33:45.281 --> 00:33:48.640
<v Speaker 6>they're making this guy like live in a house arrest and constantly have to check</v>

1192
00:33:48.641 --> 00:33:49.360
<v Speaker 6>in and that,</v>

1193
00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:49.691
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1194
00:33:49.691 --> 00:33:53.140
<v Speaker 6>it's the ball busting of him for,</v>

1195
00:33:53.141 --> 00:33:55.130
<v Speaker 6>for this one thing is,</v>

1196
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:56.950
<v Speaker 6>is extraordinary.</v>

1197
00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:57.371
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1198
00:33:57.371 --> 00:34:00.730
<v Speaker 6>it's really confusing like how much they're going after this guy.</v>

1199
00:34:00.731 --> 00:34:01.960
<v Speaker 6>But it's really not about that.</v>

1200
00:34:01.961 --> 00:34:02.351
<v Speaker 6>Of course,</v>

1201
00:34:02.351 --> 00:34:03.670
<v Speaker 6>it's about the Wiki leaks.</v>

1202
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.780
<v Speaker 6>Wiki leaks is an organization that they got a bunch of documents from,</v>

1203
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:08.200
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1204
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:13.200
<v Speaker 6>someone who was in the army and a lot of it was like very controversial and uh,</v>

1205
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.000
<v Speaker 6>it just horrible shit.</v>

1206
00:34:16.001 --> 00:34:17.200
<v Speaker 6>Like one of them,</v>

1207
00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:22.260
<v Speaker 6>they put out a video called collateral murder and it showed these guys that are,</v>

1208
00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:23.320
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1209
00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.153
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1210
00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.080
<v Speaker 6>in these helicopters,</v>

1211
00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.490
<v Speaker 6>he's a fighter,</v>

1212
00:34:27.491 --> 00:34:27.791
<v Speaker 6>jets,</v>

1213
00:34:27.791 --> 00:34:29.020
<v Speaker 6>whatever the fuck they were shooting from,</v>

1214
00:34:29.021 --> 00:34:30.280
<v Speaker 6>I think it was a helicopter.</v>

1215
00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:31.660
<v Speaker 6>And um,</v>

1216
00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:32.850
<v Speaker 6>they're uh,</v>

1217
00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:36.220
<v Speaker 6>they're shooting on civilians and they're shooting on they,</v>

1218
00:34:36.221 --> 00:34:36.581
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1219
00:34:36.581 --> 00:34:38.190
<v Speaker 6>they think that these people have guns and they,</v>

1220
00:34:38.191 --> 00:34:42.880
<v Speaker 6>in fact they have cameras and they open up on these people and they open up and</v>

1221
00:34:42.881 --> 00:34:47.881
<v Speaker 6>these people that we're putting kids in there fucking minivan and when they hear</v>

1222
00:34:48.221 --> 00:34:49.540
<v Speaker 6>that they had kids in the car,</v>

1223
00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.220
<v Speaker 6>they go up.</v>

1224
00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.880
<v Speaker 6>Shouldn't been bringing kids with them anyway.</v>

1225
00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:53.910
<v Speaker 6>Like that was like their responses.</v>

1226
00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:55.300
<v Speaker 6>Like you shouldn't have been bringing kids.</v>

1227
00:34:55.301 --> 00:34:55.570
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1228
00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:59.980
<v Speaker 6>it's not that we had to cut them down with these fucking 50 caliber rounds.</v>

1229
00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:00.720
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1230
00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.320
<v Speaker 6>they shouldn't been bringing the kids in.</v>

1231
00:35:02.321 --> 00:35:02.921
<v Speaker 6>The first one is,</v>

1232
00:35:02.921 --> 00:35:03.754
<v Speaker 6>what are we going to do?</v>

1233
00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:04.840
<v Speaker 6>It is what it is.</v>

1234
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.070
<v Speaker 6>Shouldn't been bringing kids.</v>

1235
00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:10.480
<v Speaker 6>It's like they're the glee in being able to take these people out,</v>

1236
00:35:10.481 --> 00:35:11.314
<v Speaker 6>like video games.</v>

1237
00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:15.160
<v Speaker 6>You a soldier guy and then they put this video out and there was,</v>

1238
00:35:15.161 --> 00:35:15.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1239
00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:18.520
<v Speaker 6>really controversial people saying it's terrible for morale.</v>

1240
00:35:18.521 --> 00:35:20.380
<v Speaker 6>It's this is that it shouldn't have been released.</v>

1241
00:35:20.381 --> 00:35:23.800
<v Speaker 6>And then it turns out that there's a fuck load of documents,</v>

1242
00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:26.860
<v Speaker 6>all kinds of shit that they didn't want to have release in.</v>

1243
00:35:26.861 --> 00:35:30.430
<v Speaker 6>This kid had gotten ahold of this stuff and pass it off to wikileaks and this</v>

1244
00:35:30.431 --> 00:35:32.380
<v Speaker 6>kid is still in solitary confinement.</v>

1245
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.130
<v Speaker 6>This kid is not Julian as lunch.</v>

1246
00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:34.410
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1247
00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:34.481
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1248
00:35:34.481 --> 00:35:35.020
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

1249
00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:35.561

1250
00:35:35.561 --> 00:35:36.490

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.231

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.153
<v Speaker 6>What is his name?</v>

1256
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.190
<v Speaker 6>Let me see.</v>

1257
00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:42.371
<v Speaker 6>I'll,</v>

1258
00:35:42.371 --> 00:35:42.631

00:35:42.631 --> 00:35:43.464
<v Speaker 6>I'll look it up.</v>

1260
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:44.363
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1261
00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:45.041
<v Speaker 5>so the,</v>

1262
00:35:45.041 --> 00:35:47.780
<v Speaker 5>so then the US government decided to go after wikileaks.</v>

1263
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:48.281
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1264
00:35:48.281 --> 00:35:50.710
<v Speaker 5>Then just basically fucking comb through this dude's life.</v>

1265
00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:50.891
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1266
00:35:50.891 --> 00:35:52.990
<v Speaker 6>Bradley Manning is the guy's name.</v>

1267
00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:53.480
<v Speaker 6>He's a,</v>

1268
00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.081
<v Speaker 6>he's a,</v>

1269
00:35:54.081 --> 00:35:54.460
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1270
00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.240
<v Speaker 6>he's still in,</v>

1271
00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.310
<v Speaker 6>I believe he's in solitary confinement.</v>

1272
00:35:57.311 --> 00:35:59.810
<v Speaker 6>I think he has great a years five.</v>

1273
00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:03.070
<v Speaker 6>They caught him and they just stuffed them in a cell and that's it.</v>

1274
00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:04.960
<v Speaker 6>It's really scary shit.</v>

1275
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:06.100
<v Speaker 6>They wait.</v>

1276
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.250
<v Speaker 6>Julian Assange g is the dude who leaked it.</v>

1277
00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:10.870
<v Speaker 6>If it's a website.</v>

1278
00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.680
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] is Julian Assange is the guy who ran wikileaks and he's the guy who</v>

1279
00:36:14.681 --> 00:36:15.850
<v Speaker 6>leaked all this information.</v>

1280
00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.970
<v Speaker 6>What's really crazy is that after it leaves the information,</v>

1281
00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.300
<v Speaker 6>then the sex charge comes up and they want to export them out of the country.</v>

1282
00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:26.440
<v Speaker 6>I think the Norway where they have these crazy sex laws like they have</v>

1283
00:36:26.441 --> 00:36:26.860
<v Speaker 6>different,</v>

1284
00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:27.693
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1285
00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:31.390
<v Speaker 6>people have weird laws on rape know this is where there's some feminists that</v>

1286
00:36:31.391 --> 00:36:31.691
<v Speaker 6>believe,</v>

1287
00:36:31.691 --> 00:36:31.930
<v Speaker 6>and I've,</v>

1288
00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:33.040
<v Speaker 6>I've actually written it,</v>

1289
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:37.030
<v Speaker 6>I've read this and had to go back and read it several times just to really wrap</v>

1290
00:36:37.031 --> 00:36:38.990
<v Speaker 6>my head around whether or not I,</v>

1291
00:36:38.991 --> 00:36:39.260
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1292
00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:44.260
<v Speaker 6>I heard them right then the statement was that they believe that if a woman has</v>

1293
00:36:45.251 --> 00:36:50.251
<v Speaker 6>been tricked by a man and deceived by a man and to having and talked into having</v>

1294
00:36:50.621 --> 00:36:51.454
<v Speaker 6>sex,</v>

1295
00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:52.870
<v Speaker 6>then that's rape</v>

1296
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.550
<v Speaker 5>and that's every girl I've ever had sex with</v>

1297
00:36:56.170 --> 00:36:57.070
<v Speaker 5>every girl.</v>

1298
00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:57.431
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1299
00:36:57.431 --> 00:36:58.960
<v Speaker 6>isn't that amazing that you could,</v>

1300
00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:00.130
<v Speaker 6>you should have the right,</v>

1301
00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.380
<v Speaker 6>if you feel deceived after the act,</v>

1302
00:37:02.381 --> 00:37:04.960
<v Speaker 6>after the voluntary act of intercourse.</v>

1303
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:06.070
<v Speaker 6>And she thought</v>

1304
00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:06.640
<v Speaker 5>like if the,</v>

1305
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.420
<v Speaker 5>if she tells you,</v>

1306
00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.710
<v Speaker 5>if she just thought you were a good guy,</v>

1307
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:09.301
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1308
00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:11.370
<v Speaker 6>but to call that rape is crazy.</v>

1309
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:11.700
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

1310
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:12.930
<v Speaker 6>that is deception.</v>

1311
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.540
<v Speaker 6>But the sex was voluntary so it cannot be raped.</v>

1312
00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.980
<v Speaker 6>And just because you feel bad about something that you were coerced into doing</v>

1313
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.570
<v Speaker 6>that wasn't illegal.</v>

1314
00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:22.001
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1315
00:37:22.001 --> 00:37:23.110
<v Speaker 5>What if you come really fast?</v>

1316
00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:26.520
<v Speaker 5>I'd be good at it and I've never been good at it,</v>

1317
00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.980
<v Speaker 6>but it's not illegal.</v>

1318
00:37:27.981 --> 00:37:28.910
<v Speaker 6>It's sex.</v>

1319
00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:30.680
<v Speaker 6>Rape is illegal.</v>

1320
00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:33.560
<v Speaker 6>So you can't make sex rape.</v>

1321
00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.000
<v Speaker 6>You're turning it into rape.</v>

1322
00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.110
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't rape.</v>

1323
00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.100
<v Speaker 6>You were tricked.</v>

1324
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:37.760
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

1325
00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.720
<v Speaker 6>but it was sex.</v>

1326
00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.730
<v Speaker 6>You had voluntary sex,</v>

1327
00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.020
<v Speaker 6>like to call that rape.</v>

1328
00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:47.180
<v Speaker 6>That is anybody that would even think that that would be an acceptable idea is</v>

1329
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:48.830
<v Speaker 6>an anti human that's,</v>

1330
00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:49.790
<v Speaker 6>that's anti human.</v>

1331
00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.170
<v Speaker 5>I will go for,</v>

1332
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.940
<v Speaker 5>I'll go as far to say that I believe.</v>

1333
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.420
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1334
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.340
<v Speaker 5>if you have me to put it down,</v>

1335
00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.620
<v Speaker 5>I believe that rape is when a man,</v>

1336
00:37:59.310 --> 00:37:59.820
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1337
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:00.690
<v Speaker 5>assaults a woman,</v>

1338
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:01.070
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1339
00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:03.000
<v Speaker 5>assaults a woman and makes her do something.</v>

1340
00:38:03.001 --> 00:38:04.800
<v Speaker 5>She makes her have sex when she does not want to.</v>

1341
00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.160
<v Speaker 5>And I do believe there is a gray line that we're date rape does,</v>

1342
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:08.821
<v Speaker 5>is involved.</v>

1343
00:38:08.821 --> 00:38:10.180
<v Speaker 5>I do believe there are guys that,</v>

1344
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:11.371
<v Speaker 5>that force it.</v>

1345
00:38:11.371 --> 00:38:12.540
<v Speaker 5>And the woman's saying no,</v>

1346
00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:13.021
<v Speaker 5>but they do it.</v>

1347
00:38:13.021 --> 00:38:13.490
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1348
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:16.350
<v Speaker 5>And I believe there's also a great line where women are drunk,</v>

1349
00:38:16.351 --> 00:38:16.771
<v Speaker 5>too drunk.</v>

1350
00:38:16.771 --> 00:38:17.551
<v Speaker 5>And guys take advantage of,</v>

1351
00:38:17.551 --> 00:38:17.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm a dude,</v>

1352
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:20.130
<v Speaker 5>I've been around dudes my whole life and I know that's happened.</v>

1353
00:38:20.131 --> 00:38:20.940
<v Speaker 5>I'm at present,</v>

1354
00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:21.780
<v Speaker 5>have done that.</v>

1355
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:22.280
<v Speaker 5>And the,</v>

1356
00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.240
<v Speaker 5>and they as they walk you through the night,</v>

1357
00:38:24.241 --> 00:38:24.780
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1358
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:25.920
<v Speaker 5>sounds a little rapey to me.</v>

1359
00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:26.650
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

1360
00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:27.270
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1361
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.541
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1362
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:28.370
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

1363
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:28.940
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1364
00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:30.270
<v Speaker 5>as they walk you through the night,</v>

1365
00:38:30.271 --> 00:38:30.390
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1366
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.750
<v Speaker 5>You're like,</v>

1367
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:31.110
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

1368
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:31.850
<v Speaker 5>you didn't watch.</v>

1369
00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:32.800
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>

1370
00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:33.090
<v Speaker 5>Huh,</v>

1371
00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:34.140
<v Speaker 5>maybe I should report you.</v>

1372
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:34.710
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

1373
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:35.350
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1374
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:40.350
<v Speaker 5>but I do believe that because this is not the subject I everyone's talking about</v>

1375
00:38:40.811 --> 00:38:41.644
<v Speaker 5>because it's a,</v>

1376
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.910
<v Speaker 5>like I went to college when the word rape became,</v>

1377
00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:46.870
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1378
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:50.200
<v Speaker 5>flip floppy and like chicks were saying they got raped when they genuinely</v>

1379
00:38:50.201 --> 00:38:50.590
<v Speaker 5>didn't,</v>

1380
00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:51.423
<v Speaker 5>do you know what I mean?</v>

1381
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:55.720
<v Speaker 5>Like the word rape was a buzzword and so women were using the word rape,</v>

1382
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:57.100
<v Speaker 5>like throwing it out there.</v>

1383
00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.091
<v Speaker 5>And then I think,</v>

1384
00:38:58.091 --> 00:38:58.481
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

1385
00:38:58.481 --> 00:39:01.390
<v Speaker 5>like right after that is when comics got ahold of the word rape,</v>

1386
00:39:01.391 --> 00:39:04.390
<v Speaker 5>like Sarah Silverman and made it a joke and took it.</v>

1387
00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:05.500
<v Speaker 5>That's why I love Sarah,</v>

1388
00:39:05.501 --> 00:39:05.800
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1389
00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.340
<v Speaker 5>I'll fucking always love that chick because she took things that I think I would</v>

1390
00:39:09.341 --> 00:39:13.510
<v Speaker 5>joke about with my friends and as a woman said them on stage and I thought I was</v>

1391
00:39:13.511 --> 00:39:13.661
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1392
00:39:13.661 --> 00:39:14.740
<v Speaker 5>fucking gangster dude.</v>

1393
00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:15.940
<v Speaker 5>Fucking roles.</v>

1394
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:16.810
<v Speaker 5>Definitely gangster.</v>

1395
00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:17.501
<v Speaker 5>She's funny,</v>

1396
00:39:17.501 --> 00:39:18.130
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1397
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:19.990
<v Speaker 5>She should be a supreme court judge.</v>

1398
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:22.330
<v Speaker 5>Whatever she says is right.</v>

1399
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:23.291
<v Speaker 5>That should be it.</v>

1400
00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:24.550
<v Speaker 5>Like there are women,</v>

1401
00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:24.921
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1402
00:39:24.921 --> 00:39:25.030
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1403
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:25.360
<v Speaker 5>I dunno,</v>

1404
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:25.661
<v Speaker 5>I'm fucking,</v>

1405
00:39:25.661 --> 00:39:26.494
<v Speaker 5>what am I talking about?</v>

1406
00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:26.801
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1407
00:39:26.801 --> 00:39:29.980
<v Speaker 5>it's human beings have to have their shit together in order to be able to judge</v>

1408
00:39:29.981 --> 00:39:30.341
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1409
00:39:30.341 --> 00:39:33.670
<v Speaker 5>And it's been pretty obvious that the system that they're judging people under</v>

1410
00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:36.600
<v Speaker 5>right now is just so flawed and fucked up and no,</v>

1411
00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:36.840
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1412
00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.300
<v Speaker 5>no one's saying that it should all be dismantled and that that's what's going to</v>

1413
00:39:40.301 --> 00:39:41.134
<v Speaker 5>have to happen.</v>

1414
00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:41.850
<v Speaker 5>We're going to have to do,</v>

1415
00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.670
<v Speaker 5>it would have to dismantle the whole system to make anything fair.</v>

1416
00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:46.733
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1417
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:49.180
<v Speaker 5>Preme Court justice to Supreme Court period.</v>

1418
00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.340
<v Speaker 5>All your crazy fucking laws.</v>

1419
00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:52.540
<v Speaker 5>Jesus man,</v>

1420
00:39:52.541 --> 00:39:53.920
<v Speaker 5>I heard a honeycomb,</v>

1421
00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:54.670
<v Speaker 5>a bullshit.</v>

1422
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.280
<v Speaker 5>I heard Chris rock say something one time that kind of fucking,</v>

1423
00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.260
<v Speaker 5>that redefined everything.</v>

1424
00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.980
<v Speaker 5>Men I've had like things redefined for me within the last few months.</v>

1425
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:04.330
<v Speaker 5>So big man,</v>

1426
00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:05.200
<v Speaker 5>like so big.</v>

1427
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:06.850
<v Speaker 5>We were talking about ego.</v>

1428
00:40:06.851 --> 00:40:07.270
<v Speaker 5>I fucking,</v>

1429
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:08.140
<v Speaker 5>my ego is,</v>

1430
00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.003
<v Speaker 5>is uh,</v>

1431
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.570
<v Speaker 5>that concept of ego.</v>

1432
00:40:10.571 --> 00:40:11.740
<v Speaker 5>I've never understood.</v>

1433
00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:13.180
<v Speaker 5>I fucking now understand,</v>

1434
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.540
<v Speaker 5>but Chris Rock said something about was Saturday night live racist.</v>

1435
00:40:16.541 --> 00:40:17.560
<v Speaker 5>I don't know where I heard it on.</v>

1436
00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:18.820
<v Speaker 5>And he was saying,</v>

1437
00:40:18.821 --> 00:40:19.091
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1438
00:40:19.091 --> 00:40:19.841
<v Speaker 5>it's not racist,</v>

1439
00:40:19.841 --> 00:40:24.470
<v Speaker 5>but there is a shorthand would that two white guys have that a black and white</v>

1440
00:40:24.471 --> 00:40:27.730
<v Speaker 5>guy don't have like two white guys like and Michael and say Chris Farley,</v>

1441
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:31.150
<v Speaker 5>there's a shorthand that they have that a black kid is not born with.</v>

1442
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.210
<v Speaker 5>And when I heard that I went,</v>

1443
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.200
<v Speaker 5>what do you mean by shorthand?</v>

1444
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:35.141
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1445
00:40:35.141 --> 00:40:35.411
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1446
00:40:35.411 --> 00:40:36.244
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1447
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.881
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1448
00:40:36.881 --> 00:40:37.270
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1449
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:40.960
<v Speaker 5>like going into a meeting with a bunch of white dudes and you just kind of,</v>

1450
00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:42.910
<v Speaker 5>you understand them and like,</v>

1451
00:40:42.911 --> 00:40:43.810
<v Speaker 5>or like when a guy goes,</v>

1452
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.741
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1453
00:40:44.741 --> 00:40:45.940
<v Speaker 5>how about that fucking Diaz fight?</v>

1454
00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:48.040
<v Speaker 5>And then all of a sudden you and him have a shorthand and you go to a meeting,</v>

1455
00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:48.580
<v Speaker 5>you're like,</v>

1456
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:48.701
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1457
00:40:48.701 --> 00:40:49.750
<v Speaker 5>we have something in common.</v>

1458
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:50.950
<v Speaker 5>We can talk without,</v>

1459
00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:52.870
<v Speaker 5>we know each other without having to</v>

1460
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:56.980
<v Speaker 5>dudes love doing shit like that.</v>

1461
00:40:56.981 --> 00:40:58.660
<v Speaker 5>And it's why I didn't play golf together and stuff.</v>

1462
00:40:58.661 --> 00:40:58.811
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>

1463
00:40:58.811 --> 00:40:59.291
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

1464
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:01.120
<v Speaker 5>It's in white guys love it more than any,</v>

1465
00:41:01.290 --> 00:41:01.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1466
00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:02.530
<v Speaker 5>black guys love it too,</v>

1467
00:41:02.531 --> 00:41:06.730
<v Speaker 5>but what happens is your shorthand comes from the people you grew up with.</v>

1468
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:09.280
<v Speaker 5>Like I know white dudes who are in fraternities.</v>

1469
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.940
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1470
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.560
<v Speaker 5>I don't even need to fucking say a word to them.</v>

1471
00:41:11.561 --> 00:41:12.640
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you what they do.</v>

1472
00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:14.740
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you how to act when the cameras aren't on.</v>

1473
00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.360
<v Speaker 5>I can tell you how I can tell you everything about them.</v>

1474
00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:16.871
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1475
00:41:16.871 --> 00:41:17.704
<v Speaker 5>But black dudes,</v>

1476
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:22.030
<v Speaker 5>my shorthand is based on like pretty much like the dude's I'd partied with in</v>

1477
00:41:22.031 --> 00:41:22.864
<v Speaker 5>New York.</v>

1478
00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:23.171
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1479
00:41:23.171 --> 00:41:23.531
<v Speaker 5>cause I don't,</v>

1480
00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:24.610
<v Speaker 5>I just don't know brothers.</v>

1481
00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:25.660
<v Speaker 5>And like,</v>

1482
00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.340
<v Speaker 5>I know like Godfrey Rd,</v>

1483
00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:29.380
<v Speaker 5>Tony Woods that night when Tracy Morgan,</v>

1484
00:41:29.381 --> 00:41:30.100
<v Speaker 5>like those are my,</v>

1485
00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:31.030
<v Speaker 5>that's my shorthand.</v>

1486
00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:32.200
<v Speaker 5>So I see what you're saying.</v>

1487
00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 5>So you're saying that there's,</v>

1488
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.870
<v Speaker 5>that white guys on Saturday night live have more connectedness.</v>

1489
00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.240
<v Speaker 5>They all went to Harvard.</v>

1490
00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:41.600
<v Speaker 5>They all went to college.</v>

1491
00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:42.800
<v Speaker 5>They're all into comedy.</v>

1492
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:44.570
<v Speaker 5>They all had the same comedy upbringing.</v>

1493
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.140
<v Speaker 5>Like they all had parents that's probably either divorced,</v>

1494
00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:49.700
<v Speaker 5>like they're part of the system,</v>

1495
00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:50.290
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1496
00:41:50.290 --> 00:41:50.930
<v Speaker 5>Lauren Michaels,</v>

1497
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:51.681
<v Speaker 5>Michaels being the head.</v>

1498
00:41:51.681 --> 00:41:51.891
<v Speaker 5>But she,</v>

1499
00:41:51.891 --> 00:41:53.900
<v Speaker 5>Chris Rock was saying as a kid from Brooklyn,</v>

1500
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.340
<v Speaker 5>his shorthand wasn't there.</v>

1501
00:41:55.341 --> 00:41:56.480
<v Speaker 5>So when he met Lauren Michaels,</v>

1502
00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.433
<v Speaker 5>he didn't,</v>

1503
00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.480
<v Speaker 5>he didn't know the like,</v>

1504
00:41:59.060 --> 00:41:59.421
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1505
00:41:59.421 --> 00:42:00.141
<v Speaker 5>ultimately,</v>

1506
00:42:00.141 --> 00:42:00.351
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1507
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:02.510
<v Speaker 5>it's like when you meet a network executive,</v>

1508
00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:04.790
<v Speaker 5>I kind of know what to say and what not to say.</v>

1509
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:06.290
<v Speaker 5>And I know how to act.</v>

1510
00:42:06.291 --> 00:42:10.520
<v Speaker 5>I know to wear a collared shirt if it's right and I know not to because I'm</v>

1511
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:10.760
<v Speaker 5>white.</v>

1512
00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.120
<v Speaker 5>I'm done.</v>

1513
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.970
<v Speaker 5>I've had to deal with white men my whole fucking life.</v>

1514
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:15.290
<v Speaker 5>Like Chris Rock.</v>

1515
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.060
<v Speaker 5>Never if he dealt with a white man.</v>

1516
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.660
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

1517
00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.420
<v Speaker 5>I'm guessing this is speculation based on an interview,</v>

1518
00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:21.051
<v Speaker 5>but it was like a,</v>

1519
00:42:21.051 --> 00:42:25.040
<v Speaker 5>it was a cop or a Joe going to say he never got arrested.</v>

1520
00:42:25.041 --> 00:42:25.521
<v Speaker 5>But you know what I mean?</v>

1521
00:42:25.521 --> 00:42:26.960
<v Speaker 5>Like when he saw white men,</v>

1522
00:42:26.961 --> 00:42:28.010
<v Speaker 5>who was it from a different place,</v>

1523
00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.650
<v Speaker 5>his average black man was like a dad or a friend's dad.</v>

1524
00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:35.300
<v Speaker 5>Those guys aren't running Saturday night live or running heads of business.</v>

1525
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:36.620
<v Speaker 5>That blew me away.</v>

1526
00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.210
<v Speaker 5>That concept of,</v>

1527
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.073
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

1528
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.690
<v Speaker 5>of racism not being how people act,</v>

1529
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:44.720
<v Speaker 5>but just being like as common as a shorthand.</v>

1530
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:45.680
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1531
00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:45.981
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1532
00:42:45.981 --> 00:42:49.700
<v Speaker 5>like that's very astute of him to point it out to all it's fucking genius,</v>

1533
00:42:49.701 --> 00:42:50.001
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

1534
00:42:50.001 --> 00:42:54.320
<v Speaker 5>That guy blows me away consistently because the way he sees life,</v>

1535
00:42:54.321 --> 00:42:55.280
<v Speaker 5>like I was just hearing,</v>

1536
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:57.590
<v Speaker 5>I was talking to one of his contractors and he was like,</v>

1537
00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.410
<v Speaker 5>this contractor was like putting a window in his house.</v>

1538
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:02.000
<v Speaker 5>Now this is the difference between Chris Rock,</v>

1539
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.840
<v Speaker 5>the Rock,</v>

1540
00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.700
<v Speaker 5>the window was $20,000 and he's putting his house.</v>

1541
00:43:04.701 --> 00:43:06.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure I'm not supposed to be talking about this.</v>

1542
00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:07.003
<v Speaker 5>Why are you doing?</v>

1543
00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:07.910
<v Speaker 5>Why are you doing it?</v>

1544
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:08.570
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you,</v>

1545
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:10.430
<v Speaker 5>you guys had to control my ego.</v>

1546
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:11.140
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>

1547
00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:11.600
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

1548
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.140
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

1549
00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:12.591
<v Speaker 5>the window,</v>

1550
00:43:12.591 --> 00:43:12.800
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1551
00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.850
<v Speaker 5>it's an interesting story.</v>

1552
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:15.820
<v Speaker 5>So we put some window and it's $20,000.</v>

1553
00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:16.191
<v Speaker 5>The guy goes,</v>

1554
00:43:16.191 --> 00:43:16.490
<v Speaker 5>hey look,</v>

1555
00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:17.201
<v Speaker 5>I'll copy the one.</v>

1556
00:43:17.201 --> 00:43:21.200
<v Speaker 5>I'll give you the window if you let me fucking put your mind TV show or</v>

1557
00:43:21.201 --> 00:43:21.800
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

1558
00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.930
<v Speaker 5>and like show that I'm doing Chris Rock's house.</v>

1559
00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:24.891
<v Speaker 5>Chris Rock's like,</v>

1560
00:43:24.891 --> 00:43:25.724
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

1561
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:26.840
<v Speaker 5>if I show my family,</v>

1562
00:43:26.841 --> 00:43:28.970
<v Speaker 5>I'm putting in a $20,000 a window into a house,</v>

1563
00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:30.320
<v Speaker 5>they're going to want to stay in that house.</v>

1564
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.921
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

1565
00:43:30.921 --> 00:43:33.740
<v Speaker 5>I can't just fucking put that on TV and I was like,</v>

1566
00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:33.911
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1567
00:43:33.911 --> 00:43:37.070
<v Speaker 5>I fucking put that shit on TV because my ego would come in and be like,</v>

1568
00:43:37.071 --> 00:43:38.210
<v Speaker 5>fucking Bam.</v>

1569
00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:39.100
<v Speaker 5>Let's show everyone.</v>

1570
00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:39.440
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1571
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.050
<v Speaker 5>why were you saying before that you were having a problem with your ego?</v>

1572
00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:42.980
<v Speaker 5>I just damn man,</v>

1573
00:43:42.981 --> 00:43:43.814
<v Speaker 5>it's genuine.</v>

1574
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:44.251
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>

1575
00:43:44.251 --> 00:43:44.870
<v Speaker 5>you're not,</v>

1576
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:45.350
<v Speaker 5>you're,</v>

1577
00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:45.621
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1578
00:43:45.621 --> 00:43:50.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to ask you to go back probably 15 years and try to connect to yourself</v>

1579
00:43:50.271 --> 00:43:50.960
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>

1580
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.620
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1581
00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:52.060
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1582
00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:55.370

1583
00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.070
<v Speaker 5>So you know when people just go,</v>

1584
00:43:58.130 --> 00:44:01.280
<v Speaker 5>when people just say like that you show up to a bunch of comics and they're</v>

1585
00:44:01.281 --> 00:44:01.790
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1586
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:02.121
<v Speaker 5>everyone's like,</v>

1587
00:44:02.121 --> 00:44:02.181

1589
00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:03.110
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

1590
00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:03.261
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

1591
00:44:03.261 --> 00:44:04.310
<v Speaker 5>I got to sit calm on this.</v>

1592
00:44:04.311 --> 00:44:04.661
<v Speaker 5>I got sick,</v>

1593
00:44:04.661 --> 00:44:05.150
<v Speaker 5>I'm on Mat.</v>

1594
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:06.050
<v Speaker 5>And then you just,</v>

1595
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:06.590
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

1596
00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:07.423
<v Speaker 5>I was talking to Brian,</v>

1597
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:11.130
<v Speaker 5>you just casually try to slide in what you're doing casually.</v>

1598
00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.290
<v Speaker 5>Like oh that's so cool.</v>

1599
00:44:12.291 --> 00:44:12.891
<v Speaker 5>I know Brian.</v>

1600
00:44:12.891 --> 00:44:13.041
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1601
00:44:13.041 --> 00:44:18.041
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing a thing with them like and then and that to me is fucking,</v>

1602
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:20.030
<v Speaker 5>it's so unhealthy.</v>

1603
00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:25.520
<v Speaker 5>It's the next self bragging self Bragg and like it's so unhealthy and it's so</v>

1604
00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.250
<v Speaker 5>disconnects your heart.</v>

1605
00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.830
<v Speaker 5>This is what I've been thinking disconnects your heart from humanity,</v>

1606
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.430
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1607

<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1609
00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:33.150
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>

1610
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:36.120
<v Speaker 5>what it does is it puts your brain in it cause your brain starts talking to your</v>

1611
00:44:36.121 --> 00:44:36.780
<v Speaker 5>heart going,</v>

1616
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:41.460
<v Speaker 5>because you read what he's doing,</v>

1618
00:44:42.391 --> 00:44:43.350
<v Speaker 5>You're not doing shit.</v>

1619
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:44.041

1623
00:44:51.751 --> 00:44:52.710
<v Speaker 6>pump yourself up.</v>

1624
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:53.540
<v Speaker 6>Is that what you're saying?</v>

1625
00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:55.670
<v Speaker 5>You almost have to do a better hand at cards.</v>

00:44:55.671 --> 00:44:56.630
<v Speaker 5>Like I like try to one,</v>

1632
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.530
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

1633
00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:04.030
<v Speaker 6>I ran into him and I said,</v>

1634
00:45:04.031 --> 00:45:04.151

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:10.020
<v Speaker 6>And he just went on this embarrassing run about some development deal and this</v>

1637
00:45:11.411 --> 00:45:12.400
<v Speaker 6>and if it doesn't go out,</v>

1638
00:45:12.401 --> 00:45:13.690
<v Speaker 6>I have a buyout and Dah,</v>

1639
00:45:13.691 --> 00:45:13.860
<v Speaker 6>Dah,</v>

1640
00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:14.011
<v Speaker 6>Dah,</v>

1641
00:45:14.011 --> 00:45:14.171
<v Speaker 6>Dah,</v>

00:45:14.171 --> 00:45:14.321
<v Speaker 6>Dah,</v>

00:45:14.321 --> 00:45:15.010
<v Speaker 6>Dah.</v>

1644
00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:16.630
<v Speaker 6>And they've said that this is their number.</v>

1645
00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:17.141
<v Speaker 6>And I'm like,</v>

1646
00:45:17.141 --> 00:45:17.471

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:20.080
<v Speaker 6>And then if that doesn't work,</v>

1650
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:21.083
<v Speaker 6>I've got to develop</v>

1651
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:24.040
<v Speaker 6>and it just went on and I'm like,</v>

1652
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.270
<v Speaker 6>I meant hi.</v>

1653
00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:26.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

1654
00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:27.140
<v Speaker 5>he does good to see you.</v>

1655
00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:27.801
<v Speaker 5>You cannot be,</v>

1656
00:45:27.801 --> 00:45:28.120
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>

1657
00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.930
<v Speaker 5>your heart's connected to him.</v>

1658
00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:31.340
<v Speaker 5>This is going to sound good.</v>

1659
00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:35.230
<v Speaker 5>Can I get some Celine Dion music in the back of</v>

1660
00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.690
<v Speaker 5>your heart's connected with him when you said,</v>

1661
00:45:38.691 --> 00:45:39.470
<v Speaker 5>how are you doing?</v>

1662
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:40.760
<v Speaker 5>You are genuinely asking,</v>

1663
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:42.500
<v Speaker 5>see his head was connected to you.</v>

1664
00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:43.550
<v Speaker 5>What does his Joe Rogan,</v>

1665
00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:44.570
<v Speaker 5>he's got this going on.</v>

1666
00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:47.570
<v Speaker 5>I need to prove to him that it seems like he probably left that conversation</v>

1667
00:45:47.571 --> 00:45:47.841
<v Speaker 5>going.</v>

1668
00:45:47.841 --> 00:45:48.920
<v Speaker 5>That went perfect.</v>

1669
00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:50.660
<v Speaker 6>I think one of the nicest things,</v>

1670
00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:51.853
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

1671
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:53.160
<v Speaker 5>do not put Celine Dion.</v>

1672
00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.160
<v Speaker 5>We'll start fucking dick under the table.</v>

1673
00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:57.180
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1674
00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:59.130
<v Speaker 6>I'd like doing a lot of different things.</v>

1675
00:45:59.131 --> 00:46:03.030
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to have my whole entire identity to connect it to one thing,</v>

1676
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.440
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

1677
00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.390
<v Speaker 6>And whether it's one thing in,</v>

1678
00:46:05.391 --> 00:46:06.211
<v Speaker 6>in my life,</v>

1679
00:46:06.211 --> 00:46:07.560
<v Speaker 6>whether it's one thing and what,</v>

1680
00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:09.060
<v Speaker 6>what my occupation is,</v>

1681
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:10.470
<v Speaker 6>I just think there's a,</v>

1682
00:46:10.471 --> 00:46:11.190
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

1683
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:15.150
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot to be gained in flexibility and you know,</v>

1684
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:16.310
<v Speaker 6>in,</v>

1685
00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:20.220
<v Speaker 6>in being able to do a bunch of different things and not having to rely on one,</v>

1686
00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.610
<v Speaker 6>I've been able to like not have to define myself,</v>

1687
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:24.743
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1688
00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.580
<v Speaker 6>I'll do whatever the fuck I do.</v>

1689
00:46:26.670 --> 00:46:27.271
<v Speaker 6>I do what I do.</v>

1690
00:46:27.271 --> 00:46:27.511
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1691
00:46:27.511 --> 00:46:32.130
<v Speaker 6>like to worry about the world of comedy or worry about the world of MMA.</v>

1692
00:46:32.131 --> 00:46:34.110
<v Speaker 6>A worry of I just do my shit</v>

1693
00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:34.910
<v Speaker 5>we have now.</v>

1694
00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:39.060
<v Speaker 5>That's you and that you are not the average of people.</v>

1695
00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:39.601
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1696
00:46:39.601 --> 00:46:40.980
<v Speaker 5>but I think everybody can do it.</v>

1697
00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:41.970
<v Speaker 5>I think everyone can do it.</v>

1698
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:44.730
<v Speaker 5>When I heard you talking,</v>

1699
00:46:44.731 --> 00:46:45.710
<v Speaker 5>I was in Europe and I,</v>

1700
00:46:45.711 --> 00:46:46.210
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1701
00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:47.190
<v Speaker 5>I fall asleep,</v>

1702
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.910
<v Speaker 5>I listened to show when I sleep I put a play it all night long and I just have</v>

1703
00:46:50.911 --> 00:46:52.530
<v Speaker 5>it on repeat so I hear it all night long.</v>

1704
00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:55.590
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the greatest things if you don't already do that,</v>

1705
00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.740
<v Speaker 5>that I'm telling you when I say that's the greatest way to fucking listen to</v>

1706
00:46:58.741 --> 00:47:01.800
<v Speaker 5>podcasts because you feel like you're hanging out with friends and they're in</v>

1707
00:47:01.801 --> 00:47:02.910
<v Speaker 5>the other room and you're safe.</v>

1708
00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.290
<v Speaker 5>And I get lonely on the road.</v>

1709
00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:07.010
<v Speaker 5>It's even better when it's you on the podcast and you hear,</v>

1710
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.110
<v Speaker 5>I heard me talking to you and I was fucking right.</v>

1711
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:09.660
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

1712
00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:10.080
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1723
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.500
<v Speaker 5>with um,</v>

1724
00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:24.060
<v Speaker 5>getting into the tank and getting rid of your ego.</v>

1725
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.631
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

1726

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:27.300

1729
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:28.860
<v Speaker 5>where's my ego?</v>

<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1734
00:47:32.411 --> 00:47:33.041
<v Speaker 6>not arguing,</v>

1735
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:34.960
<v Speaker 6>but being argumentative,</v>

1736
00:47:34.961 --> 00:47:37.780
<v Speaker 6>being difficult just about ego based Shit.</v>

1737
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:38.591
<v Speaker 6>Like someone would say,</v>

1738

<v Speaker 6>my crew,</v>

1740
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:41.680
<v Speaker 6>and I'd be like,</v>

1741
00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:42.281
<v Speaker 6>in my head,</v>

1742

1747
00:47:49.391 --> 00:47:51.130
<v Speaker 6>like I did in front of Ari last night,</v>

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.490
<v Speaker 6>but I'll fucking own this shit.</v>

1749
00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:58.540
<v Speaker 6>I saw Ari lessons.</v>

1750
00:47:58.541 --> 00:48:00.370
<v Speaker 6>When you say you're doing work on your ego,</v>

1751
00:48:00.371 --> 00:48:01.001
<v Speaker 6>what do you mean?</v>

1754
00:48:05.651 --> 00:48:06.430
<v Speaker 6>feelings.</v>

<v Speaker 6>you get a t,</v>

1757
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:08.163
<v Speaker 6>when you feel like,</v>

1758
00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:13.120
<v Speaker 6>when you feel like [inaudible] statement is directed at you like last night</v>

1762
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:16.991
<v Speaker 6>Nevermind.</v>

1764
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:20.860
<v Speaker 6>But Ari was,</v>

1765
00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:22.390
<v Speaker 6>Ari saw me fucking bike.</v>

1766
00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:23.733
<v Speaker 6>I started saying,</v>

1767
00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:24.813
<v Speaker 6>I started to Brag,</v>

1768
00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.040
<v Speaker 6>I started to say something to brag and then I went,</v>

1769
00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:28.420
<v Speaker 6>I stopped myself out loud.</v>

1770
00:48:28.421 --> 00:48:30.130
<v Speaker 6>And when I'm not doing that and he goes,</v>

1771
00:48:30.131 --> 00:48:30.341
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

1772
00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:30.521
<v Speaker 6>And I go,</v>

1773
00:48:30.521 --> 00:48:32.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm not saying what I'm about to say cause it's a fucking stupid.</v>

1774
00:48:32.951 --> 00:48:33.784
<v Speaker 6>This is stupid.</v>

1775
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:34.990
<v Speaker 6>So that's what I'm trying to do.</v>

1776
00:48:34.991 --> 00:48:37.710
<v Speaker 6>I'm trying to be more connected to people by my heart and,</v>

1777
00:48:37.711 --> 00:48:39.640
<v Speaker 6>and hear what they're saying as a human.</v>

1778
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:40.503
<v Speaker 6>Just like when someone goes,</v>

1779
00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:40.961
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>

00:48:43.991 --> 00:48:44.621
<v Speaker 6>what do I have to,</v>

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:46.090
<v Speaker 6>I have this going on.</v>

1787
00:48:46.091 --> 00:48:46.924
<v Speaker 6>I have this going on.</v>

1788
00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:47.650
<v Speaker 6>Not like,</v>

1789
00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:48.550
<v Speaker 6>oh my grades are good.</v>

1790
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:49.990
<v Speaker 6>They have a violin recital tomorrow.</v>

1791
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.550
<v Speaker 6>Like not like real shit,</v>

1792
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:52.840
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

1793
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:53.230
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1794
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:53.471
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1795
00:48:53.471 --> 00:48:55.720
<v Speaker 6>I think as a human being,</v>

1796
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:56.480
<v Speaker 6>when you,</v>

1797
00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.620
<v Speaker 6>you have something that's your occupation or something that you're obsessed</v>

1798
00:48:59.621 --> 00:49:00.220
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

1799
00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:00.810
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

1800
00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:01.270
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1801
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.571
<v Speaker 6>there,</v>

1802
00:49:01.571 --> 00:49:05.920
<v Speaker 6>you build up a lot of stress when you're pursuing something and a lot of that</v>

1803
00:49:05.921 --> 00:49:07.990
<v Speaker 6>stress can be evacuated physically.</v>

1804
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:10.360
<v Speaker 6>And that's what a lot of people aren't aware of.</v>

1805
00:49:10.361 --> 00:49:12.540
<v Speaker 6>Like I goof around and,</v>

1806
00:49:12.541 --> 00:49:13.151
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

1807
00:49:13.151 --> 00:49:14.340
<v Speaker 6>and talk to people about,</v>

1808
00:49:14.341 --> 00:49:14.680
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1809
00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.320
<v Speaker 6>you know about yoga and goof on yoga people.</v>

1810
00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:22.321
<v Speaker 6>But Yoga is like a brilliant way of managing your emotions and your body.</v>

1811
00:49:23.321 --> 00:49:23.491
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1812
00:49:23.491 --> 00:49:25.720
<v Speaker 6>and the idea of the word centered.</v>

1813
00:49:25.721 --> 00:49:26.554
<v Speaker 6>I hate the,</v>

1814
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.370
<v Speaker 6>I hate,</v>

1815
00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:28.690
<v Speaker 6>I hate crystal talk.</v>

1816
00:49:28.691 --> 00:49:29.524
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1817
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.370
<v Speaker 6>I hate,</v>

1818
00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:30.960
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1819
00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.550
<v Speaker 6>well my yoga going on a retreat,</v>

1820
00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:36.580
<v Speaker 6>there's a cleanse that's a fucking teacher by the way.</v>

1821
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.413
<v Speaker 6>I hate crystal.</v>

1822
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:38.710
<v Speaker 6>I crystal talk.</v>

1823
00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.580
<v Speaker 6>It drives me nuts.</v>

1824
00:49:39.581 --> 00:49:40.090
<v Speaker 6>I hate,</v>

1825
00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:42.190
<v Speaker 6>I hate it when I know that it's a,</v>

1826
00:49:42.191 --> 00:49:42.820
<v Speaker 6>you're just,</v>

1827
00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:43.930
<v Speaker 6>you've accepted this,</v>

1828
00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:46.000
<v Speaker 6>this new age ideology,</v>

1829
00:49:46.001 --> 00:49:46.241
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

1830
00:49:46.241 --> 00:49:46.511
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1831
00:49:46.511 --> 00:49:46.701
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1832
00:49:46.701 --> 00:49:49.270
<v Speaker 6>and there's a lot of yoga talk that goes along with that.</v>

1833
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:52.180
<v Speaker 6>But Yoga as a practice is a brilliant practice.</v>

1834
00:49:52.181 --> 00:49:53.560
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking hard to do,</v>

1835
00:49:53.561 --> 00:49:54.190
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

1836
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:55.023
<v Speaker 6>There's people that like,</v>

1837
00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.210
<v Speaker 6>oh you're,</v>

1838
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:57.063
<v Speaker 6>you're working out.</v>

1839
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:58.480
<v Speaker 6>Oh you're doing yoga.</v>

1840
00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.250
<v Speaker 6>That's not working out the fuck.</v>

1841
00:50:00.251 --> 00:50:01.420
<v Speaker 6>It's not man Yoga.</v>

1842
00:50:01.421 --> 00:50:02.254
<v Speaker 6>It's hard.</v>

1843
00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:06.190
<v Speaker 6>Some of the worst ass kickings I've ever had of Jujitsu was when I did yoga in</v>

1844
00:50:06.191 --> 00:50:07.930
<v Speaker 6>the morning and then do Jujitsu at night.</v>

1845
00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:08.171
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1846
00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:08.890
<v Speaker 6>Cause your beat,</v>

1847
00:50:08.890 --> 00:50:09.790
<v Speaker 6>I'm fucking beat.</v>

1848
00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:10.091
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1849
00:50:10.091 --> 00:50:10.390
<v Speaker 6>I didn't,</v>

1850
00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:13.570
<v Speaker 6>I did it like I don't like I can fucking do yoga in the morning.</v>

1851
00:50:13.571 --> 00:50:15.040
<v Speaker 6>I'm not going to be tired for Jujitsu.</v>

1852
00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.360
<v Speaker 6>Fucking not man.</v>

1853
00:50:16.361 --> 00:50:20.710
<v Speaker 6>Some of those poses are really difficult and they're designed to like rain all</v>

1854
00:50:20.711 --> 00:50:23.830
<v Speaker 6>the stress out of your body and they humble you.</v>

1855
00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.400
<v Speaker 6>You walk out of there when you,</v>

1856
00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:27.590
<v Speaker 6>when you have to go through physical exertion,</v>

1857
00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 6>physical</v>

1858
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:28.581
<v Speaker 5>exertion,</v>

1859
00:50:28.581 --> 00:50:30.260
<v Speaker 5>like to the point where your body's failing.</v>

1860
00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:31.490
<v Speaker 5>That is very humbling,</v>

1861
00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:32.420
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

1862
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.920
<v Speaker 5>And then when you get a speech at the end,</v>

1863
00:50:33.921 --> 00:50:36.860
<v Speaker 5>that's what I love about Yoga is you get into child's pose where you're just</v>

1864
00:50:36.861 --> 00:50:38.450
<v Speaker 5>laying there and they talk to you,</v>

1865
00:50:38.451 --> 00:50:38.661

<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2017
00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:46.350
<v Speaker 5>so this was the wings of the butterfly.</v>

2018
00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:49.230
<v Speaker 5>This turned you into one of the many wings of the butterfly.</v>

2019
00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:49.641
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2020
00:53:49.641 --> 00:53:51.660
<v Speaker 5>you have a few uncomfortably dumb,</v>

2021
00:53:51.870 --> 00:53:52.740
<v Speaker 5>but this was a big one.</v>

2022
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:53.431
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

2023
00:53:53.431 --> 00:53:54.264
<v Speaker 5>Brian,</v>

2024
00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:56.180
<v Speaker 6>what were your wings?</v>

2025
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:57.543
<v Speaker 7>My wings.</v>

2026
00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:01.680
<v Speaker 5>What does my wins?</v>

2027
00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.090
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

2028
00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.590
<v Speaker 5>give me some moments where you went,</v>

2029
00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:05.041
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2030
00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:06.300
<v Speaker 5>this is what I do for now on.</v>

2031
00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:08.071
<v Speaker 5>I'm a,</v>

2032
00:54:08.071 --> 00:54:08.904
<v Speaker 5>I'm real good at</v>

2033
00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.830
<v Speaker 6>commanding to shit.</v>

2034
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:11.720
<v Speaker 6>Like if I like to do something,</v>

2035
00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:16.780
<v Speaker 6>I'm real good at like throwing my entire brain at it and becoming obsessed with</v>

2036
00:54:17.271 --> 00:54:17.630
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

2037
00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:19.040
<v Speaker 6>It's probably not healthy.</v>

2038
00:54:19.041 --> 00:54:22.430
<v Speaker 6>It's probably like a lot of success I think.</v>

2039
00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.640
<v Speaker 6>And this is my belief about like,</v>

2040
00:54:24.641 --> 00:54:24.860
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2041
00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:27.320
<v Speaker 6>athletics that a lot of success in athletics,</v>

2042
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:29.990
<v Speaker 6>it comes down to almost like a psychosis.</v>

2043
00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:30.741
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2044
00:54:30.741 --> 00:54:35.720
<v Speaker 6>like there's did like a and a real high level of anything.</v>

2045
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:37.310
<v Speaker 6>There's a certain amount of,</v>

2046
00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.173
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2047
00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:43.480
<v Speaker 6>almost crazy behavior to get to this incredible position like a Michael Jordan</v>

2048
00:54:43.521 --> 00:54:43.641
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>

2049
00:54:43.641 --> 00:54:44.050
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2050
00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:44.300
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2051
00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:44.840
<v Speaker 6>or uh,</v>

2052
00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:45.171
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2053
00:54:45.171 --> 00:54:46.700
<v Speaker 6>or Muhammad Ali or you know,</v>

2054
00:54:46.701 --> 00:54:47.091
<v Speaker 6>any,</v>

2055
00:54:47.091 --> 00:54:49.880
<v Speaker 6>any like elite highly Mike Tyson in his prime.</v>

2056
00:54:49.881 --> 00:54:50.490
<v Speaker 6>And this,</v>

2057
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:51.620
<v Speaker 6>there's a madness,</v>

2058
00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:52.753
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2059
00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:55.070
<v Speaker 6>and I,</v>

2060
00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.100
<v Speaker 6>from the time that I was a kid,</v>

2061
00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:59.630
<v Speaker 6>I was involved in martial arts,</v>

2062
00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:00.650
<v Speaker 6>so it wasn't like,</v>

2063
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:03.050
<v Speaker 6>it was like a choice that I made when I was like 14 or 15.</v>

2064
00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:04.530
<v Speaker 6>And that was a choice that I was on it.</v>

2065
00:55:04.531 --> 00:55:06.140
<v Speaker 6>So I was like 21 I know.</v>

2066
00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:11.230
<v Speaker 6>But when I realized that I had to stop fighting and stop teaching and just do</v>

2067
00:55:13.761 --> 00:55:16.820
<v Speaker 6>comedy was I was talking to a kid,</v>

2068
00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:17.870
<v Speaker 6>his name is Jonathan.</v>

2069
00:55:17.871 --> 00:55:19.010
<v Speaker 6>I wish I remembered his last name,</v>

2070
00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:20.151
<v Speaker 6>but we were open.</v>

2071
00:55:20.151 --> 00:55:22.790
<v Speaker 6>Miker is together about six months in a comedy.</v>

2072
00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:26.690
<v Speaker 6>I was still dabbling in it and I still had my feet in all my other worlds trying</v>

2073
00:55:26.691 --> 00:55:27.560
<v Speaker 6>to find my place.</v>

2074
00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:31.330
<v Speaker 6>And this dude who I'd done open mikes with for like six months goes,</v>

2075
00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:32.810
<v Speaker 6>you were really funny in the beginning.</v>

2076
00:55:32.811 --> 00:55:33.290
<v Speaker 6>But man,</v>

2077
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:36.380
<v Speaker 6>he just kind of petered out after a while</v>

2078
00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:37.920
<v Speaker 7>really.</v>

2079
00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:38.491
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

2080
00:55:38.491 --> 00:55:38.790
<v Speaker 6>wow.</v>

2081
00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:41.610
<v Speaker 6>And I couldn't even say anything because I knew he was right.</v>

2082
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:42.743
<v Speaker 6>Oh it was.</v>

2083
00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:43.561
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2084
00:55:43.561 --> 00:55:44.550
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't say anything.</v>

2085
00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.530
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't say anything cause in my head,</v>

2086
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:46.861
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2087
00:55:46.861 --> 00:55:48.870
<v Speaker 6>like if someone says you don't work hard enough,</v>

2088
00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:49.290
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

2089
00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:51.660
<v Speaker 6>my instinct is always to go fuck you.</v>

2090
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:55.380
<v Speaker 6>But I know as a person who's,</v>

2091
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:56.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2092
00:55:56.490 --> 00:56:00.230
<v Speaker 6>benefited greatly from very uncomfortable criticisms before,</v>

2093
00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:04.200
<v Speaker 6>like some of the biggest growth moments you can have was where someone just</v>

2094
00:56:04.201 --> 00:56:07.260
<v Speaker 6>knocked your dick into the dirt and like she know what the fuck is a great</v>

2095
00:56:07.261 --> 00:56:09.330
<v Speaker 6>statement and then you step back.</v>

2096
00:56:09.331 --> 00:56:11.460
<v Speaker 6>And so I recognized early on to,</v>

2097
00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:12.031
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2098
00:56:12.031 --> 00:56:15.720
<v Speaker 6>to be able to step back and objective Lee obsessed when challenged like that.</v>

2099
00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.680
<v Speaker 6>So it was when that guy said that I,</v>

2100
00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:18.900
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to go,</v>

2101
00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:21.570
<v Speaker 6>that's a dickhead thing to say cause you know he was my friend,</v>

2102
00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:23.010
<v Speaker 6>but I was,</v>

2103
00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 6>he's right.</v>

2104
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:24.730
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2105
00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:25.563
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't say anything.</v>

2106
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:26.050
<v Speaker 5>So I said,</v>

2107
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:26.681
<v Speaker 5>this is it.</v>

2108
00:56:26.681 --> 00:56:27.370

2312
01:01:36.681 --> 01:01:40.880
<v Speaker 5>It's awesome to hear word but it wouldn't have mean meant anything if you</v>

2314

<v Speaker 5>I do see that.</v>

2315
01:01:43.971 --> 01:01:46.550
<v Speaker 5>I appreciate that because I've said this to a number of times,</v>

2316
01:01:46.551 --> 01:01:48.380
<v Speaker 5>but man distinctly this,</v>

2317
01:01:48.381 --> 01:01:49.214
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2318
01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:53.120
<v Speaker 5>I mean the whole reason the whole thing came up is this fucking podcast.</v>

2319
01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:56.060
<v Speaker 5>Like I went to New York and people had heard this podcast and they were like,</v>

2320
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:56.960
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

2321
01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.820
<v Speaker 5>I heard that machine story on Joe's podcast.</v>

2322
01:01:58.821 --> 01:01:59.654
<v Speaker 5>Can you do a book?</v>

2323
01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:00.780
<v Speaker 5>And this is the,</v>

2324
01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:04.360
<v Speaker 5>that from your podcasts that tape got passed to all look at it.</v>

2325
01:02:04.361 --> 01:02:09.361
<v Speaker 5>Another way of looking at it is how lucky am I that I get to be on a podcast</v>

2326
01:02:09.711 --> 01:02:10.101
<v Speaker 5>with guys?</v>

2327
01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:13.490
<v Speaker 5>Like you have such great stories that make people on tune in and listen again</v>

2328
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:14.930
<v Speaker 5>cause your egos in check.</v>

2329
01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.760
<v Speaker 5>That's fucking really sweet of you to say Joe.</v>

2330
01:02:16.761 --> 01:02:17.860
<v Speaker 5>But I will genuinely,</v>

2331
01:02:18.550 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 5>it's not that I me to say that</v>

2332
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.330
<v Speaker 6>it's 100% how I feel.</v>

2333
01:02:21.331 --> 01:02:22.600
<v Speaker 6>I think we're,</v>

2334
01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:23.520
<v Speaker 6>we're all real lucky.</v>

2335
01:02:23.521 --> 01:02:23.791
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2336
01:02:23.791 --> 01:02:25.710

2337
01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:27.090

<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2340
01:02:28.651 --> 01:02:33.090
<v Speaker 6>we got a connection with people that we never thought would take place,</v>

2341
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.871
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2342

<v Speaker 5>it's a bizarre,</v>

2356
01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:55.940
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>

2357
01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:59.090
<v Speaker 5>it's like showing up to San Francisco when the first dude's like,</v>

01:03:23.931 --> 01:03:25.280
<v Speaker 6>We did a 10:00 PM show,</v>

2379
01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:25.731
<v Speaker 6>didn't,</v>

2380
01:03:25.731 --> 01:03:25.911
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2381
01:03:25.911 --> 01:03:27.810
<v Speaker 6>didn't even get started to like 10 30 it.</v>

2382
01:03:27.811 --> 01:03:29.990
<v Speaker 6>We're totally changing that whole entire ice house.</v>

2383
01:03:29.991 --> 01:03:30.161
<v Speaker 6>We're,</v>

2384
01:03:30.161 --> 01:03:34.070
<v Speaker 6>we're bringing that fucking club back because I mean a lot of the comics last</v>

2385
01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:35.780
<v Speaker 6>night said I used like Doug Benson,</v>

2386
01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:37.820
<v Speaker 6>I used to love coming to the ice house,</v>

2387
01:03:37.821 --> 01:03:40.730
<v Speaker 6>but then something weird happened and it just like that and I get started</v>

2388
01:03:40.731 --> 01:03:43.910
<v Speaker 6>getting kind of different and it wasn't that fun to go to anymore.</v>

2389
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:44.271
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2390
01:03:44.271 --> 01:03:45.650
<v Speaker 6>but like tonight he's like,</v>

2391
01:03:45.651 --> 01:03:47.120
<v Speaker 6>that was one of the funniest times ever.</v>

2392
01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:49.130
<v Speaker 6>The best crowds we've ever had ever.</v>

2393
01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.073
<v Speaker 6>And it's,</v>

2394
01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:52.730
<v Speaker 6>it's almost like hard to believe.</v>

2395
01:03:52.731 --> 01:03:55.190
<v Speaker 6>You would assume that you know,</v>

2396
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:58.070
<v Speaker 6>you don't think that people have really have different crowds.</v>

2397
01:03:58.100 --> 01:03:59.540
<v Speaker 6>You don't think that people like bring,</v>

2398
01:03:59.541 --> 01:04:00.111
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

2399
01:04:00.111 --> 01:04:00.531
<v Speaker 6>You feel like,</v>

2400
01:04:00.531 --> 01:04:04.010
<v Speaker 6>well Chicago is different than New York in New York is different than San</v>

2401
01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:04.340
<v Speaker 6>Francisco.</v>

2402
01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:05.660
<v Speaker 6>But what's been,</v>

2403
01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:09.050
<v Speaker 6>what's changed recently for us is that everywhere we go,</v>

2404
01:04:09.051 --> 01:04:11.150
<v Speaker 6>the crowds have been amazing.</v>

2405
01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:15.140
<v Speaker 6>Like really nice people like really enthusiastic and you got to go,</v>

2406
01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.940
<v Speaker 6>how the fuck does that happen?</v>

2407
01:04:16.941 --> 01:04:18.560
<v Speaker 6>Like how can you pull that off?</v>

2408
01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:21.800
<v Speaker 6>Like what is no one ever thought that there was a formula for doing that.</v>

2409
01:04:21.830 --> 01:04:25.430
<v Speaker 6>No one ever thought that there was a formula where you could go and ensure that</v>

2410
01:04:25.431 --> 01:04:30.431
<v Speaker 6>you would have a huge percentage of the population that kind of thinks along the</v>

2411
01:04:30.681 --> 01:04:33.050
<v Speaker 6>same way that you think would be nice to people.</v>

2412

2414
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:37.050

2732
01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.800

2737
01:11:52.261 --> 01:11:52.501
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2738
01:11:52.501 --> 01:11:53.610
<v Speaker 5>his last special when we talk,</v>

2739

<v Speaker 5>who likes to be in the corporate world,</v>

2740
01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:59.380
<v Speaker 5>how many people are in there that are enjoying that a lot?</v>

2741
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.260
<v Speaker 5>That's just where they're at.</v>

2742
01:12:01.290 --> 01:12:02.123
<v Speaker 5>They're stuck,</v>

2743
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:02.900
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

2744
01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:04.680
<v Speaker 5>That's what a shitty existence.</v>

2745
01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:05.280
<v Speaker 5>I would never,</v>

2746
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.500
<v Speaker 5>the weirdest thing about our whole society,</v>

2747
01:12:07.501 --> 01:12:10.620
<v Speaker 5>our whole culture is in order for it to work the way it is right now,</v>

2748
01:12:10.621 --> 01:12:14.520
<v Speaker 5>we can go to the store and buy a fucking soda and getting a car and just turn</v>

2749
01:12:14.521 --> 01:12:15.270
<v Speaker 5>the key and drive it.</v>

2750
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:20.250
<v Speaker 5>Someone has to do some shit that they don't want it everywhere has got to take</v>

2751
01:12:20.251 --> 01:12:22.090
<v Speaker 5>it on the Chin every fucking morning.</v>

2752
01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:26.970
<v Speaker 5>He got to recognize that unless they can figure out how to make robots that do</v>

2753
01:12:26.971 --> 01:12:27.804
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>

2754
01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:28.501
<v Speaker 5>And then even that,</v>

2755
01:12:28.501 --> 01:12:31.590
<v Speaker 5>are you really going to find a guy that wants to program that robot to do</v>

2756
01:12:31.591 --> 01:12:34.950
<v Speaker 5>everything or is it going to be a job that he has to do and it sucks?</v>

2757
01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:35.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2758
01:12:35.850 --> 01:12:38.790
<v Speaker 5>there's no way that everybody could live the life of Bert Kreischer.</v>

2759
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:39.960
<v Speaker 5>It's not possible.</v>

2760
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.880
<v Speaker 5>Someone's got to be out there huffing it.</v>

2761
01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:43.980
<v Speaker 5>Bert ditches need to be dug,</v>

2762
01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:46.913
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

2809

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2815
01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:02.040
<v Speaker 5>to have a bunch of people that have a bunch of different opinions on how</v>

2816
01:14:02.041 --> 01:14:03.570
<v Speaker 5>something should be done on fear factor.</v>

2817
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:06.640
<v Speaker 5>And it would be if they were trying to deconstruct my stand up.</v>

2818
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:08.190
<v Speaker 5>When you start,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Entertainment.</v>

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:48.190
<v Speaker 5>They,</v>

01:15:48.190 --> 01:15:51.430
<v Speaker 5>they got in a hole and they started owing people money from a college gigs,</v>

2907

<v Speaker 5>but he paid me eventually,</v>

2908
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:55.080
<v Speaker 5>but it took a while.</v>

2909
01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:55.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm not a bad guy.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I definitely am not going to be my manager right now,</v>

2917
01:16:04.481 --> 01:16:06.790
<v Speaker 5>but everybody's fired him.</v>

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:13.730
<v Speaker 6>You're a fucking asshole.</v>

3275
01:24:13.731 --> 01:24:14.181

01:24:14.860 --> 01:24:16.160
<v Speaker 6>you handled it like a gentleman.</v>

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.140
<v Speaker 6>He was a guy who stole jokes.</v>

<v Speaker 6>That's the guy was still jokes for sure.</v>

01:24:51.441 --> 01:24:53.810
<v Speaker 6>you made them your own wow.</v>

3303
01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:56.300
<v Speaker 6>Areas.</v>

3304
01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.180
<v Speaker 6>Last comic standing was not the yardstick for us.</v>

3305
01:24:58.600 --> 01:24:59.391
<v Speaker 6>And by the way,</v>

3306
01:24:59.391 --> 01:24:59.811
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>

3307
01:24:59.811 --> 01:25:00.644
<v Speaker 6>the judging,</v>

3308
01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:02.300
<v Speaker 6>this was a very cats show too.</v>

3309
01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:03.981
<v Speaker 6>And by the way,</v>

3310
01:25:03.981 --> 01:25:05.920
<v Speaker 6>the judging was complete total horse shit.</v>

3311
01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:06.711
<v Speaker 6>It didn't matter.</v>

3312
01:25:06.711 --> 01:25:06.891
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>

3313
01:25:06.891 --> 01:25:09.440
<v Speaker 6>there was people that we voted for that didn't get in and people that we didn't</v>

3314
01:25:09.441 --> 01:25:10.370
<v Speaker 6>go for the God in,</v>

3315
01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:11.391
<v Speaker 6>they had decided,</v>

3316
01:25:11.391 --> 01:25:14.330
<v Speaker 6>the producers all got together and decided how to,</v>

3317
01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:15.590
<v Speaker 6>how to put people on.</v>

3318
01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:18.470
<v Speaker 6>I remember I did trying to remember,</v>

3319
01:25:18.471 --> 01:25:19.940
<v Speaker 6>I'm drew Carey walked off.</v>

3320
01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:21.500
<v Speaker 6>It was a judge and uh,</v>

3321
01:25:21.530 --> 01:25:23.420
<v Speaker 6>who else didn't matter because of Dan Adelman.</v>

3322
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:26.150
<v Speaker 6>10 elements are very funny comic and he should've won,</v>

3323
01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:28.100
<v Speaker 6>but he just wasn't castable like,</v>

3324
01:25:28.101 --> 01:25:31.040
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't one of the guys that are looking for that's so ridiculous.</v>

3325
01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.530
<v Speaker 6>Them ideas of who's castable and who's not.</v>

3326
01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:33.831
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3327
01:25:33.831 --> 01:25:35.660
<v Speaker 6>it's so funny whenever you get a bunch of people,</v>

3328
01:25:35.661 --> 01:25:39.380
<v Speaker 6>like I'm so used to doing the podcast where there's no one telling us what to</v>

3329
01:25:39.381 --> 01:25:39.890
<v Speaker 6>do,</v>

3330
01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:43.460
<v Speaker 6>but to watch like Dave Attell doing showed yesterday and the guy's like,</v>

3331
01:25:43.461 --> 01:25:44.181
<v Speaker 6>can you sit up?</v>

3332
01:25:44.181 --> 01:25:45.014
<v Speaker 6>Can you move this?</v>

3333
01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:45.831
<v Speaker 6>The guy asked me,</v>

3334
01:25:45.831 --> 01:25:46.790
<v Speaker 6>actually asked me,</v>

3335
01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:47.600
<v Speaker 6>can you,</v>

3336
01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.330
<v Speaker 6>can you push your right pant leg down a little?</v>

3337
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:51.470
<v Speaker 6>And I was like,</v>

3338
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:52.160
<v Speaker 6>why?</v>

3339
01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:52.311
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3340
01:25:52.311 --> 01:25:53.840
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of puffy in that one spot.</v>

3341
01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:54.410
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

3342
01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:56.030
<v Speaker 6>oh my fucking God.</v>

3346
01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:02.600
<v Speaker 6>but that's how they do it,</v>

3353
01:26:06.211 --> 01:26:07.310

<v Speaker 6>six different people yelling instructions and all trying to piece this thing</v>

3355
01:26:10.641 --> 01:26:11.420
<v Speaker 6>together.</v>

3356
01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.950
<v Speaker 6>It's way less harmonious.</v>

3357
01:26:12.951 --> 01:26:14.780
<v Speaker 6>Then you piecing it together on your own,</v>

3444
01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Like A,</v>

3445
01:28:23.930 --> 01:28:25.400
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's a fake video.</v>

3446
01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:26.453
<v Speaker 2>I can't be really,</v>

3447
01:28:26.970 --> 01:28:27.920
<v Speaker 2>well I think it's very,</v>

3448
01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:29.120
<v Speaker 2>because it's one of those videos.</v>

3449
01:28:29.121 --> 01:28:30.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like one,</v>

3450
01:28:30.081 --> 01:28:31.230
<v Speaker 2>why is it guy just,</v>

3451
01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:31.911
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3452
01:28:31.911 --> 01:28:33.890
<v Speaker 2>Recording people do that.</v>

3453
01:28:34.190 --> 01:28:35.023
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3454
01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:39.980
<v Speaker 2>And then it's just like how shit and he was barely going fast and he loses</v>

3455
01:28:39.981 --> 01:28:40.730
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

3456
01:28:40.730 --> 01:28:41.451
<v Speaker 2>Did you notice that?</v>

3457
01:28:41.451 --> 01:28:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Like he just,</v>

3458
01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:43.610
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't going like super fast.</v>

3459
01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:45.380
<v Speaker 2>He just like kind of sped up and I was like,</v>

3460
01:28:45.381 --> 01:28:48.350
<v Speaker 2>how did he lose control of his Lamborghini that bad?</v>

3461
01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:48.981
<v Speaker 2>And then when,</v>

3462
01:28:48.981 --> 01:28:50.990
<v Speaker 2>how it was placed in between the two cards,</v>

3463
01:28:50.991 --> 01:28:51.530
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3464
01:28:51.530 --> 01:28:51.741
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

3465
01:28:51.741 --> 01:28:54.380
<v Speaker 2>this is some kind of weird fake video.</v>

3466
01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:56.120
<v Speaker 2>Like who's behind it though?</v>

3467
01:28:56.121 --> 01:28:56.661
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

3468
01:28:56.661 --> 01:29:00.830
<v Speaker 2>Like Lamborghini maybe would say you probably got a good point,</v>

3469
01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.100
<v Speaker 2>but Lamborghinis</v>

3470
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:05.970
<v Speaker 6>are notoriously hard to control and that's a four wheel drive car too.</v>

3471
01:29:06.330 --> 01:29:07.340
<v Speaker 6>That's a funky car.</v>

3472
01:29:07.410 --> 01:29:08.710
<v Speaker 6>Really hard to control that.</v>

3473
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:11.380
<v Speaker 6>Especially because it's all like Salish paddle battle.</v>

3474
01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:12.450
<v Speaker 6>I might not be,</v>

3475
01:29:12.451 --> 01:29:13.320
<v Speaker 6>see that's,</v>

3476
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:14.183
<v Speaker 6>that's the,</v>

3477
01:29:14.230 --> 01:29:16.560
<v Speaker 6>that's the Guyardo the one that crashed.</v>

3478
01:29:16.650 --> 01:29:16.820
<v Speaker 6>Right,</v>

3479
01:29:16.820 --> 01:29:17.760
<v Speaker 6>and the Guy Auto Yuki,</v>

3480
01:29:17.770 --> 01:29:19.980
<v Speaker 6>you can still get them with the manual.</v>

3481
01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:20.941
<v Speaker 6>The Guy,</v>

3482
01:29:20.941 --> 01:29:21.331
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3483
01:29:21.331 --> 01:29:26.331
<v Speaker 6>he might've like over hit the gas on a shift or he might've went sideways and</v>

3484
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:28.110
<v Speaker 6>not sure.</v>

3485
01:29:28.111 --> 01:29:31.170
<v Speaker 6>I'll have some and he might've had to rig it might be real,</v>

3486
01:29:31.230 --> 01:29:32.220
<v Speaker 6>but I agree with you.</v>

3487
01:29:32.221 --> 01:29:32.960
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't look weird.</v>

3488
01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:33.180
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

3489
01:29:33.180 --> 01:29:34.470
<v Speaker 6>it's a suspicious physics.</v>

3490
01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:34.900
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3491
01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:38.640
<v Speaker 6>It's weird because I saw it last night for my first time and immediately I</v>

3492
01:29:38.641 --> 01:29:39.540
<v Speaker 6>looked at it going,</v>

3493
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:42.430
<v Speaker 6>how did he just lose control that fastest that I,</v>

3494
01:29:42.630 --> 01:29:43.680
<v Speaker 6>it wasn't that fast.</v>

3495
01:29:43.681 --> 01:29:44.820
<v Speaker 6>He wasn't going that fast.</v>

3496
01:29:44.850 --> 01:29:45.061
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3497
01:29:45.061 --> 01:29:46.030
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't matter anyway,</v>

3498
01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.250
<v Speaker 6>when you're going around a corner,</v>

3499
01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:48.753
<v Speaker 6>especially</v>

3500
01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:51.720
<v Speaker 6>using street tires,</v>

3501
01:29:52.190 --> 01:29:53.310
<v Speaker 6>but the car gets out of control.</v>

3502
01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:54.550
<v Speaker 6>There's no fucking bring it a pack.</v>

3503
01:29:54.630 --> 01:29:55.463
<v Speaker 6>It's hard.</v>

3504
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:56.270
<v Speaker 6>It's hard.</v>

3505
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.760
<v Speaker 6>You just,</v>

3506
01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:57.900
<v Speaker 6>you have to know how to drive.</v>

3507
01:29:58.110 --> 01:30:01.450
<v Speaker 6>There's a great video of two guys in Corvettes and there's a guy behind him and</v>

3508
01:30:01.451 --> 01:30:03.180
<v Speaker 6>films it and they're in sugar land,</v>

3509
01:30:03.410 --> 01:30:04.220
<v Speaker 6>not in sugar land.</v>

3510
01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:05.070
<v Speaker 6>The woodlands,</v>

3511
01:30:05.071 --> 01:30:06.120
<v Speaker 6>I think in Texas,</v>

3512
01:30:06.121 --> 01:30:06.780
<v Speaker 6>one of those.</v>

3513
01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:08.550
<v Speaker 6>And they take off at the light.</v>

3514
01:30:08.551 --> 01:30:11.210
<v Speaker 6>One Guy fucking completely loses control t bones,</v>

3515
01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:11.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3516
01:30:11.490 --> 01:30:13.330
<v Speaker 6>car like the fun of it.</v>

3517
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:14.240
<v Speaker 6>And it's,</v>

3518
01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:17.610
<v Speaker 6>it's a real video that's super real because the guy and the guy and they've</v>

3519
01:30:17.611 --> 01:30:18.151
<v Speaker 6>watched the video.</v>

3520
01:30:18.151 --> 01:30:18.451
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>

3521
01:30:18.451 --> 01:30:20.010
<v Speaker 6>let's see what these assholes do.</v>

3522
01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:21.600
<v Speaker 6>You know they're going to race.</v>

3523
01:30:21.970 --> 01:30:22.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3524
01:30:22.620 --> 01:30:23.453
<v Speaker 6>And he got it.</v>

3525
01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:24.293
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

3526
01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.610
<v Speaker 6>that guy is going to be filming everything from now on.</v>

3527
01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:28.260
<v Speaker 6>What a great to catch on film.</v>

3528
01:30:28.290 --> 01:30:31.020
<v Speaker 6>And here's another thing to always think about when you look at these videos,</v>

3529
01:30:31.050 --> 01:30:33.330
<v Speaker 6>it's like you didn't know that majority of people,</v>

3530
01:30:33.331 --> 01:30:33.790
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3531
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:34.860
<v Speaker 6>like I'm a little different.</v>

3532
01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:36.340
<v Speaker 6>If I were to have filmed it,</v>

3533
01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:37.710
<v Speaker 6>it would be looked different.</v>

3534
01:30:37.890 --> 01:30:38.730
<v Speaker 6>But the majority of people,</v>

3535
01:30:38.731 --> 01:30:39.391
<v Speaker 6>you know when you're,</v>

3536
01:30:39.391 --> 01:30:40.440
<v Speaker 6>you're in a car,</v>

3537
01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:41.180
<v Speaker 6>you're filming,</v>

3538
01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:41.941
<v Speaker 6>use your iPhone,</v>

3539
01:30:41.941 --> 01:30:42.751
<v Speaker 6>your steering,</v>

3540
01:30:42.751 --> 01:30:44.970
<v Speaker 6>you're doing all this shit when you're going around a corner.</v>

3541
01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:49.290
<v Speaker 6>He was really good with making sure he caught every single thing that happened</v>

3542
01:30:49.291 --> 01:30:51.480
<v Speaker 6>while he's driving and filming.</v>

3543
01:30:51.481 --> 01:30:53.700
<v Speaker 6>And it was just too good of like,</v>

3544
01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:54.451
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

3545
01:30:54.451 --> 01:30:54.781
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3546
01:30:54.781 --> 01:30:55.890
<v Speaker 6>you got the money shot,</v>

3547
01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:59.010
<v Speaker 6>where in reality it was probably like this phone would be flopping around</v>

3548
01:30:59.011 --> 01:31:01.040
<v Speaker 6>looking at fucking ceilings and shit.</v>

3549
01:31:01.041 --> 01:31:01.351
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3550
01:31:01.351 --> 01:31:02.240
<v Speaker 6>a very good point.</v>

3551
01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:03.990
<v Speaker 6>It's like you kind of forget that.</v>

3552
01:31:03.991 --> 01:31:04.321
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

3553
01:31:04.321 --> 01:31:05.960
<v Speaker 6>it's filmed on a shitty camera.</v>

3554
01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:06.120
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3555
01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:07.440
<v Speaker 6>it looks realistic,</v>

3556
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:10.350
<v Speaker 6>but the money shot was recorded perfectly.</v>

3557
01:31:10.351 --> 01:31:12.630
<v Speaker 6>Everything was recorded a little bit too perfectly.</v>

3558
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:14.850
<v Speaker 6>And as somebody that does that kind of shit,</v>

3559
01:31:14.851 --> 01:31:15.470
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

3560
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:16.303
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of like a,</v>

3561
01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:19.950
<v Speaker 6>I know what the reality is that this is just some guy filming it.</v>

3562
01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:21.900
<v Speaker 6>He would have been filming his girlfriend's Crotch,</v>

3563
01:31:22.110 --> 01:31:22.441
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3564
01:31:22.441 --> 01:31:22.651
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3565
01:31:22.651 --> 01:31:23.490
<v Speaker 6>it would've been just like,</v>

3566
01:31:23.730 --> 01:31:24.563
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3567
01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:26.360
<v Speaker 6>maybe if that had been you,</v>

3568
01:31:26.361 --> 01:31:27.870
<v Speaker 6>you have gotten the shot perfectly.</v>

3569
01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:28.510
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

3570
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:28.771
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3571
01:31:28.771 --> 01:31:29.050
<v Speaker 6>The month.</v>

3572
01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:30.360
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of use out there.</v>

3573
01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:30.631
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3574
01:31:30.631 --> 01:31:33.300
<v Speaker 6>You got to realize this guy is a guy who's filming things,</v>

3575
01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:34.313
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3576
01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:36.900
<v Speaker 6>but by just by having a guy who's like,</v>

3577
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.863
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3578
01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:38.641
<v Speaker 6>who knows,</v>

3579
01:31:38.641 --> 01:31:39.270
<v Speaker 6>who knows though,</v>

3580
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:41.640
<v Speaker 6>but like it wasn't supposed to be the guy driving there was filming.</v>

3581
01:31:41.650 --> 01:31:42.451
<v Speaker 6>I think it was,</v>

3582
01:31:42.451 --> 01:31:42.811
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

3583
01:31:42.811 --> 01:31:43.561
<v Speaker 6>I saw it last night.</v>

3584
01:31:43.561 --> 01:31:43.651
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

3585
01:31:43.651 --> 01:31:44.281

3688
01:34:48.570 --> 01:34:48.780
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3689
01:34:48.780 --> 01:34:49.613

3690
01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:51.213
<v Speaker 5>Oh</v>

3691
01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:53.440
<v Speaker 5>it was raining.</v>

3692
01:34:53.470 --> 01:34:54.850
<v Speaker 5>You have to be careful of a,</v>

3693
01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:58.100
<v Speaker 5>with a car that's got that much power to when you on the gas,</v>

3694
01:34:58.400 --> 01:34:59.090
<v Speaker 6>you know like,</v>

3695
01:34:59.090 --> 01:34:59.570
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3696
01:34:59.570 --> 01:35:01.610
<v Speaker 6>like that stupid car that I have that Shelby,</v>

3697
01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:02.810
<v Speaker 6>the Mustang I,</v>

3698
01:35:02.811 --> 01:35:04.820
<v Speaker 6>every time I hit second gear I can't,</v>

3699
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:07.660
<v Speaker 6>you got to make sure you don't stomp on the gas too much because it will get</v>

3700
01:35:07.661 --> 01:35:09.620
<v Speaker 6>sideways on you in second gear.</v>

3701
01:35:09.650 --> 01:35:10.483
<v Speaker 6>Give you a little more.</v>

3702
01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:11.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3703
01:35:11.650 --> 01:35:13.160
<v Speaker 6>for Christ you can drive this car.</v>

3704
01:35:13.161 --> 01:35:13.620
<v Speaker 6>I doubt that.</v>

3705
01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:16.280
<v Speaker 6>You know that the odds that that guy in that video,</v>

3706
01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:17.840
<v Speaker 6>you know if I can drag that.</v>

3707
01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:21.050
<v Speaker 6>Oh you say that though.</v>

3708
01:35:21.051 --> 01:35:22.010
<v Speaker 6>But some,</v>

3709
01:35:22.011 --> 01:35:26.630
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people buy cars and they don't necessarily know how to handle them when</v>

3710
01:35:26.631 --> 01:35:28.490
<v Speaker 6>though the asset and goes out on them.</v>

3711
01:35:29.090 --> 01:35:31.190
<v Speaker 6>I would not be able to recover that car.</v>

3712
01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:32.053
<v Speaker 6>It's hard man.</v>

3713
01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:36.080
<v Speaker 6>It's hard and sometimes you don't want to let go of the steering or you don't</v>

3714
01:35:36.081 --> 01:35:37.520
<v Speaker 6>want to let go of the gas either.</v>

3715
01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:38.720
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes you have to,</v>

3716
01:35:38.721 --> 01:35:40.550
<v Speaker 6>you have to power oversteer you have to,</v>

3717
01:35:40.551 --> 01:35:42.620
<v Speaker 6>you have to fight it with the throttle.</v>

3718
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:44.660
<v Speaker 6>You know you have to keep your foot on the gas.</v>

3719
01:35:44.661 --> 01:35:45.140
<v Speaker 6>Cause if you,</v>

3720
01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:48.140
<v Speaker 6>if it snaps back and be like catches Griff and then you know,</v>

3721
01:35:48.141 --> 01:35:49.700
<v Speaker 6>while you're already in a turn like you can,</v>

3722
01:35:49.730 --> 01:35:50.720
<v Speaker 6>you can get fucked.</v>

3723
01:35:51.050 --> 01:35:51.950
<v Speaker 6>Oh we drove.</v>

3724
01:35:51.951 --> 01:35:56.330
<v Speaker 6>It depends entirely on a car to those cars are meant to be driven like that.</v>

3725
01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:58.190
<v Speaker 6>Like Porsche's are notorious for like,</v>

3726
01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:01.460
<v Speaker 6>they have a weird weight bias cause they were like an engine in the rear.</v>

3727
01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:03.500
<v Speaker 6>So like when you're going around corners,</v>

3728
01:36:03.501 --> 01:36:04.520
<v Speaker 6>like sideways,</v>

3729
01:36:04.521 --> 01:36:07.640
<v Speaker 6>you're dealing with the physics of this engine hanging out back.</v>

3730
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:11.660
<v Speaker 6>It's like 60% of the weight is the ass end of the car.</v>

3731
01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:12.571
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

3732
01:36:12.571 --> 01:36:12.780
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3733
01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:15.260
<v Speaker 6>so if you had a friend who came to you and was like,</v>

3734
01:36:15.650 --> 01:36:15.981
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

3735
01:36:15.981 --> 01:36:17.240
<v Speaker 6>I just got my big deal.</v>

3736
01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:18.141
<v Speaker 6>Oh I need some,</v>

3737
01:36:18.141 --> 01:36:19.130
<v Speaker 6>I want to buy a car.</v>

3738
01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:21.670
<v Speaker 6>So the one car would you get with it?</v>

3739
01:36:21.670 --> 01:36:23.180
<v Speaker 6>It depends on what kind of a person he was.</v>

3740
01:36:23.181 --> 01:36:24.014
<v Speaker 6>A single dude.</v>

3741
01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:24.231
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3742
01:36:24.231 --> 01:36:24.771
<v Speaker 6>But is he,</v>

3743
01:36:24.771 --> 01:36:25.790
<v Speaker 6>is he an animal?</v>

3744
01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:26.310
<v Speaker 6>Is the,</v>

3745
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.810
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3746
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:29.180
<v Speaker 6>it has to be a calm fellow that you know,</v>

3747
01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:30.650
<v Speaker 6>likes is comfortable car?</v>

3748
01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:30.901
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

3749
01:36:30.901 --> 01:36:31.160
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>

3750
01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:31.993
<v Speaker 6>you know who he is.</v>

3751
01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:35.210
<v Speaker 6>He's a Dane Cook because I'm never forget the conversation you over Dane,</v>

3752
01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:36.920
<v Speaker 6>when Dana talked about his Maserati,</v>

3753
01:36:36.921 --> 01:36:37.754
<v Speaker 6>that was a lemon.</v>

3754
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:40.220
<v Speaker 6>I'll never forget that because I'm the kid wasn't a Maserati.</v>

3755
01:36:40.221 --> 01:36:41.820
<v Speaker 6>I think it was a Bentley.</v>

3756
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.823
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

3757
01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:43.690

3775
01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:09.770
<v Speaker 6>It was called a nine nine six,</v>

3780
01:37:21.831 --> 01:37:23.920
<v Speaker 6>of it after a major problem.</v>

3781
01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:25.460

<v Speaker 6>the one that looks like a Mercedes</v>

3820
01:38:28.900 --> 01:38:29.733
<v Speaker 6>car.</v>

3821

<v Speaker 6>Hondai it puts out Hyundai Hondai puts out a great fucking car.</v>

3822
01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:35.461
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3823
01:38:35.461 --> 01:38:36.300
<v Speaker 6>especially this one,</v>

3824
01:38:36.301 --> 01:38:36.721
<v Speaker 6>this one.</v>

3825
01:38:36.721 --> 01:38:41.340
<v Speaker 6>They've basically taken all the design elements of Mercedes and Alexis.</v>

3826
01:38:41.341 --> 01:38:45.300
<v Speaker 6>They're like best costs essentially made the same kind of car.</v>

3827
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:47.070
<v Speaker 6>It's real fucking similar.</v>

3828
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:48.850
<v Speaker 6>And they do a,</v>

3829
01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:49.950
<v Speaker 6>it's a great car.</v>

3830
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:51.150
<v Speaker 6>I mean it looks like a Mercedes.</v>

3831
01:38:51.190 --> 01:38:52.023
<v Speaker 6>It looks like a Mercedes.</v>

3832
01:38:52.570 --> 01:38:53.590
<v Speaker 6>All the shit in Mercedes.</v>

3833
01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:53.850
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

3834
01:38:53.850 --> 01:38:56.910
<v Speaker 6>it just doesn't have the like whatever the thing that makes it a Mercedes is</v>

3835
01:38:56.911 --> 01:38:58.110
<v Speaker 6>$90,000.</v>

3836
01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:58.930
<v Speaker 6>Well it's,</v>

3837
01:38:58.930 --> 01:39:00.330
<v Speaker 6>it's very high end.</v>

3838
01:39:00.331 --> 01:39:00.720
<v Speaker 6>They said,</v>

3839
01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:04.770
<v Speaker 6>they said it's very comfortable to drive and they're really reliable cars too.</v>

3840
01:39:04.771 --> 01:39:07.770
<v Speaker 6>You know the thing about Hyundai is it's not like it's a shit car.</v>

3841
01:39:08.270 --> 01:39:08.520
<v Speaker 6>They're,</v>

3842
01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.020
<v Speaker 6>they're reliable cars just as much.</v>

3843
01:39:10.021 --> 01:39:10.690
<v Speaker 6>So as a,</v>

3844
01:39:10.690 --> 01:39:13.020
<v Speaker 6>any other car that's in that price range,</v>

3845
01:39:13.021 --> 01:39:14.010
<v Speaker 6>but it's a pretty nice,</v>

3846
01:39:14.011 --> 01:39:17.850
<v Speaker 6>but like $34,000 a year send to visually wise,</v>

3847
01:39:17.851 --> 01:39:19.680
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's anything special.</v>

3848
01:39:19.710 --> 01:39:20.840
<v Speaker 6>Well neither is Alexis.</v>

3849
01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:23.270
<v Speaker 6>Look at the Lexus ls four 60 I think it is,</v>

3850
01:39:23.271 --> 01:39:23.701
<v Speaker 6>the new one,</v>

3851
01:39:23.701 --> 01:39:24.330
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is.</v>

3852
01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:25.111
<v Speaker 6>Beautiful car.</v>

3853
01:39:25.111 --> 01:39:26.400
<v Speaker 6>But real set date,</v>

3854
01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:30.180
<v Speaker 6>it's all about luxury is transportation and those cars like Alexis,</v>

3855
01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:33.600
<v Speaker 6>those cars are so quiet and peaceful.</v>

3856
01:39:33.690 --> 01:39:34.081
<v Speaker 6>I love,</v>

3857

3860
01:39:36.091 --> 01:39:37.140

<v Speaker 6>those Lexus four doors.</v>

3864
01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:41.760
<v Speaker 6>I like the most relaxing,</v>

3865
01:39:41.761 --> 01:39:42.300
<v Speaker 6>calm,</v>

3866
01:39:42.300 --> 01:39:43.800

4054
01:44:01.431 --> 01:44:03.560
<v Speaker 6>just doing kickboxing or something along those lines.</v>

4055
01:44:03.710 --> 01:44:06.050
<v Speaker 6>It's more applicable to like getting attacked.</v>

4056
01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:06.620
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

<v Speaker 6>they go over,</v>

4065
01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:15.231
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4066
01:44:15.231 --> 01:44:16.100
<v Speaker 6>all sorts of different,</v>

4067
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:17.480
<v Speaker 6>it's not just,</v>

4068
01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:18.111
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4069
01:44:18.111 --> 01:44:19.430
<v Speaker 6>a self defense.</v>

4070
01:44:19.431 --> 01:44:19.771
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

4071
01:44:19.771 --> 01:44:19.911
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

4072
01:44:19.911 --> 01:44:22.040
<v Speaker 6>they incorporate a lot of different things.</v>

4073
01:44:22.041 --> 01:44:23.060
<v Speaker 6>It's like a system of,</v>

4074
01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:23.481
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4075
01:44:23.481 --> 01:44:26.810
<v Speaker 6>taking like what's the most useful martial arts in a real life situation.</v>

4076
01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:28.040
<v Speaker 6>So that's what it is,</v>

4077
01:44:28.630 --> 01:44:29.120
<v Speaker 6>which is,</v>

4078
01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:29.331
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4079
01:44:29.331 --> 01:44:30.170
<v Speaker 6>there's room for that.</v>

4080
01:44:30.570 --> 01:44:30.960
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

4081
01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:32.960
<v Speaker 6>I'm personally of the school that,</v>

4082
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.291
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4083
01:44:33.291 --> 01:44:34.124
<v Speaker 6>like people say,</v>

4084
01:44:34.270 --> 01:44:34.631
<v Speaker 6>well we,</v>

4085
01:44:34.631 --> 01:44:34.840
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4086
01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:34.971
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4087
01:44:34.971 --> 01:44:38.750
<v Speaker 6>I've had these arguments with the so called Lake Street defense people and</v>

4088
01:44:38.751 --> 01:44:38.961
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>

4089
01:44:38.961 --> 01:44:39.091
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4090
01:44:39.091 --> 01:44:40.050
<v Speaker 6>we learn is a,</v>

4091
01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:41.750
<v Speaker 6>how to defend yourself on the street.</v>

4092
01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:42.261
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4093
01:44:42.261 --> 01:44:43.940
<v Speaker 6>it was a no rules on the street.</v>

4094
01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:44.891
<v Speaker 6>And in the,</v>

4095
01:44:44.891 --> 01:44:46.850
<v Speaker 6>the mixed martial arts Dojo,</v>

4096
01:44:46.851 --> 01:44:47.121
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4097
01:44:47.121 --> 01:44:48.680
<v Speaker 6>there's rules and that's all well and good.</v>

4098
01:44:48.681 --> 01:44:49.720
<v Speaker 6>We appreciate the discipline,</v>

4099
01:44:49.730 --> 01:44:50.563
<v Speaker 6>but there's no rules,</v>

4100
01:44:50.630 --> 01:44:51.860
<v Speaker 6>there's no rules on the street.</v>

4101
01:44:52.190 --> 01:44:54.080
<v Speaker 6>So that's why I support is different.</v>

4102
01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:54.651
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4103
01:44:54.651 --> 01:44:54.871
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>

4104
01:44:54.871 --> 01:44:57.680
<v Speaker 6>I like to try to bite you and grab your balls or something like that.</v>

4105
01:44:58.640 --> 01:44:59.300
<v Speaker 6>But my,</v>

4106
01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:03.920
<v Speaker 6>my take has always been that the most effective techniques aren't the techniques</v>

4107
01:45:03.921 --> 01:45:06.950
<v Speaker 6>that work on people who don't know what they're doing and all the techniques,</v>

4108
01:45:06.980 --> 01:45:08.090
<v Speaker 6>almost all of them.</v>

4109
01:45:08.150 --> 01:45:10.760
<v Speaker 6>And that you see in so-called self defense courses,</v>

4110
01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:12.910
<v Speaker 6>they only work if people don't know what they're doing.</v>

4111
01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:15.420
<v Speaker 6>Like the all the grabbing hands and pulling in you,</v>

4112
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:16.850
<v Speaker 6>you ain't grab my hand bench.</v>

4113
01:45:17.150 --> 01:45:17.530
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4114
01:45:17.530 --> 01:45:17.830
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

4115
01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:19.280
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to be a wild cat.</v>

4116
01:45:19.310 --> 01:45:19.700
<v Speaker 6>We've got,</v>

4117
01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:22.310
<v Speaker 6>we've got some crazy shit going on right here and you're not grabbing me and</v>

4118
01:45:22.311 --> 01:45:23.060
<v Speaker 6>just holding on to me.</v>

4119
01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:23.930
<v Speaker 6>That's nonsense.</v>

4120
01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:24.761
<v Speaker 6>And so when,</v>

4121
01:45:24.761 --> 01:45:27.020
<v Speaker 6>when I see any of that self defense nonsense,</v>

4122
01:45:27.021 --> 01:45:27.350
<v Speaker 6>I go,</v>

4123
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:28.730
<v Speaker 6>there's a reason why this doesn't work.</v>

4124
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:29.930
<v Speaker 6>And the reason why it doesn't work,</v>

4125
01:45:29.931 --> 01:45:31.160
<v Speaker 6>it's because it doesn't work on a killer.</v>

4126
01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:32.091
<v Speaker 6>You need to,</v>

4127
01:45:32.091 --> 01:45:33.830
<v Speaker 6>everything you need to do.</v>

4128
01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:35.930
<v Speaker 6>And if you wanted to learn true martial arts,</v>

4129
01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:38.330
<v Speaker 6>you should learn what works on killers.</v>

4130
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:41.570
<v Speaker 6>Learn what works on the best fighters on the planet.</v>

4131
01:45:41.571 --> 01:45:43.220
<v Speaker 6>Learn what works on Moitai finders.</v>

4132
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:46.460
<v Speaker 6>Learn what works on a Jujitsu fighter is learn what works on a guy who knows how</v>

4133
01:45:46.461 --> 01:45:49.640
<v Speaker 6>to fuck people up and he's been training in it for years.</v>

4134
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:51.500
<v Speaker 6>You learn how to deal with that guy.</v>

4135
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:54.650
<v Speaker 6>Don't learn how to deal with some dude like pulling out your keys and going for</v>

4136
01:45:54.651 --> 01:45:55.430
<v Speaker 6>his eyes.</v>

4137
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:58.310
<v Speaker 6>Cause most likely he'll knock you the fuck out before you get close enough to do</v>

4138
01:45:58.311 --> 01:45:59.144
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

4139
01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:03.410
<v Speaker 6>Learn how to do what works on killers.</v>

4140
01:46:03.650 --> 01:46:04.730
<v Speaker 6>That's my opinion.</v>

4141
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:05.871
<v Speaker 6>So I don't,</v>

4142
01:46:05.871 --> 01:46:08.450
<v Speaker 6>I'm not a big believer in self defense courses.</v>

4143
01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:10.340
<v Speaker 6>I'm a big believer in martial arts.</v>

4144
01:46:10.341 --> 01:46:11.060
<v Speaker 6>I think you,</v>

4145
01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:12.290
<v Speaker 6>if you want to learn Jujitsu,</v>

4146
01:46:12.291 --> 01:46:15.740
<v Speaker 6>you should learn the type of Jujitsu where you know if you get ahold of someone</v>

4147
01:46:15.741 --> 01:46:16.670
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't matter.</v>

4148
01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:17.600
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

4149
01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:17.811
<v Speaker 6>You,</v>

4150
01:46:17.811 --> 01:46:18.740
<v Speaker 6>you own them now.</v>

4151
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:21.110
<v Speaker 6>That's your world and you strangled them and you,</v>

4152
01:46:21.111 --> 01:46:22.550
<v Speaker 6>you get to that point and that's a,</v>

4153
01:46:22.551 --> 01:46:25.730
<v Speaker 6>that's a beautiful tool to have in your toolbox.</v>

4154
01:46:25.731 --> 01:46:26.940
<v Speaker 6>It's a beautiful thing to,</v>

4155
01:46:27.210 --> 01:46:27.530
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

4156
01:46:27.530 --> 01:46:27.800
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

4157
01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:29.090
<v Speaker 6>to be in possession of.</v>

4158
01:46:29.210 --> 01:46:32.120
<v Speaker 6>Marshall childs was saying that you don't ever get that if you're in a self</v>

4159
01:46:32.121 --> 01:46:33.590
<v Speaker 6>defense course because first of all,</v>

4160
01:46:33.591 --> 01:46:35.650
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to have the amount of uh,</v>

4161
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:39.470
<v Speaker 6>proficiency and doing these techniques like knee brakes and attacks to the</v>

4162
01:46:39.471 --> 01:46:42.530
<v Speaker 6>ground cause you're not really doing them full blast and training against people</v>

4163
01:46:42.531 --> 01:46:43.364
<v Speaker 6>who were resisting.</v>

4164
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:44.450
<v Speaker 6>So a lot of what you're doing,</v>

4165
01:46:44.451 --> 01:46:47.120
<v Speaker 6>you're drilling repetition and you might get better at completing those</v>

4166
01:46:47.121 --> 01:46:47.691
<v Speaker 6>movements,</v>

4167
01:46:47.691 --> 01:46:51.180
<v Speaker 6>but the odds of doing it on a guy who knows how to fight,</v>

4168
01:46:51.181 --> 01:46:52.440
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty fucking small.</v>

4169
01:46:52.650 --> 01:46:53.483
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4170
01:46:53.610 --> 01:46:54.810
<v Speaker 6>Anderson Silva type dude,</v>

4171
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:57.780
<v Speaker 6>knock your fucking dome off your neck and it's that simple.</v>

4172
01:46:57.990 --> 01:46:58.171
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4173
01:46:58.171 --> 01:47:01.160
<v Speaker 6>you're never going to get to eye gouge him is going to light you up.</v>

4174
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:04.620
<v Speaker 6>And it's like you've got to look at it that way.</v>

4175
01:47:04.621 --> 01:47:04.820
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4176
01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:05.611
<v Speaker 6>in my opinion.</v>

4177
01:47:05.611 --> 01:47:07.200
<v Speaker 6>And so there's nothing wrong with crop them.</v>

4178
01:47:07.201 --> 01:47:07.560
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>

4179
01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:08.730
<v Speaker 6>it's a good way to work out.</v>

4180
01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:09.810
<v Speaker 6>It's a good way to train,</v>

4181
01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:10.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4182
01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:12.420
<v Speaker 6>and it's a very effective system in martial arts.</v>

4183
01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:16.490
<v Speaker 5>Do you mean you worked with Marshall at the laugh laughing school?</v>

4184
01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:17.100
<v Speaker 5>Uh Huh.</v>

4185
01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:17.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4186
01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:18.080
<v Speaker 5>he does.</v>

4187
01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:18.381
<v Speaker 5>He did.</v>

4188
01:47:18.381 --> 01:47:20.270
<v Speaker 5>He talk to you about more a Jujitsu?</v>

4189
01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:20.840
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

4190
01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:21.740
<v Speaker 5>he does Jiu Jitsu.</v>

4191
01:47:21.770 --> 01:47:22.040
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

4192
01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:22.851
<v Speaker 5>like aggressive.</v>

4193
01:47:22.851 --> 01:47:23.900
<v Speaker 5>We talked a little bit about it,</v>

4194
01:47:24.050 --> 01:47:24.561
<v Speaker 5>but he's,</v>

4195
01:47:24.561 --> 01:47:25.520
<v Speaker 5>he's definitely,</v>

4196
01:47:25.521 --> 01:47:26.210
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4197
01:47:26.210 --> 01:47:27.350
<v Speaker 5>he said that exact same thing,</v>

4198
01:47:27.351 --> 01:47:30.830
<v Speaker 5>that it just was like a nice set of,</v>

4199
01:47:31.330 --> 01:47:32.163
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

4200
01:47:32.540 --> 01:47:36.410
<v Speaker 5>abilities to have in place and that he get became more relaxed around people.</v>

4201
01:47:36.730 --> 01:47:37.240
<v Speaker 5>He never,</v>

4202
01:47:37.240 --> 01:47:38.240
<v Speaker 5>because he was smaller,</v>

4203
01:47:38.370 --> 01:47:39.860
<v Speaker 5>not smaller but smaller,</v>

4204
01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:43.550
<v Speaker 5>and he just never felt like he could ever get hurt because he knew how to get</v>

4205
01:47:43.551 --> 01:47:44.240
<v Speaker 5>out of it.</v>

4206
01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:44.541
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

4207
01:47:44.541 --> 01:47:44.781
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

4208
01:47:44.781 --> 01:47:45.620
<v Speaker 5>you can still get hurt.</v>

4209
01:47:45.650 --> 01:47:46.550
<v Speaker 5>You got to always be</v>

4210
01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:47.051
<v Speaker 6>careful.</v>

4211
01:47:47.051 --> 01:47:47.351
<v Speaker 6>People,</v>

4212
01:47:47.351 --> 01:47:47.681
<v Speaker 6>this is the,</v>

4213
01:47:47.681 --> 01:47:48.071
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>

4214
01:47:48.071 --> 01:47:52.360
<v Speaker 6>there's knives and guns and gangs and sticks and you know,</v>

4215
01:47:52.361 --> 01:47:53.171
<v Speaker 6>you can always get hurt.</v>

4216
01:47:53.171 --> 01:47:55.690
<v Speaker 6>Like the idea that you were in vulnerable now and you can just walk through any</v>

4217
01:47:55.691 --> 01:47:56.800
<v Speaker 6>bad neighborhood is crazy,</v>

4218
01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:57.460
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

4219
01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:00.040
<v Speaker 6>But the less,</v>

4220
01:48:00.590 --> 01:48:04.660
<v Speaker 6>you certainly have less apprehensions because you know that you've reached a</v>

4221
01:48:04.661 --> 01:48:08.050
<v Speaker 6>physical proficiency when it comes to defending yourself that very few people</v>

4222
01:48:08.051 --> 01:48:08.884
<v Speaker 6>have ever reached.</v>

4223
01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:10.180
<v Speaker 6>So if some shit goes down,</v>

4224
01:48:10.181 --> 01:48:11.590
<v Speaker 6>most likely you're going to be fine.</v>

4225
01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:12.461
<v Speaker 6>Most likely,</v>

4226
01:48:12.461 --> 01:48:14.200
<v Speaker 6>this guy's in for some horrible,</v>

4227
01:48:14.201 --> 01:48:15.040
<v Speaker 6>rude awakening,</v>

4228
01:48:15.430 --> 01:48:17.380
<v Speaker 6>which most people don't know how to fight her into.</v>

4229
01:48:17.410 --> 01:48:17.830
<v Speaker 6>If they,</v>

4230
01:48:17.830 --> 01:48:19.590
<v Speaker 6>if they get in there with a guy who knows how to fight,</v>

4231
01:48:19.970 --> 01:48:22.840
<v Speaker 6>they're in for a terrifying awakening of what's the difference between,</v>

4232
01:48:22.841 --> 01:48:26.200
<v Speaker 6>so I want to spend zero time training out of fine and someone has dedicated a</v>

4233
01:48:26.201 --> 01:48:29.590
<v Speaker 6>lifetime of doing it as a different [inaudible] guys going to own you.</v>

4234
01:48:29.650 --> 01:48:32.350
<v Speaker 6>And it's a terrifying feeling to get owned by someone,</v>

4235
01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:34.120
<v Speaker 6>especially if you get on in the straight man.</v>

4236
01:48:34.150 --> 01:48:34.983
<v Speaker 6>Whew.</v>

4237
01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:37.600
<v Speaker 6>Especially if you get onto to the street and you're the one that started it.</v>

4238
01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:38.800
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4239
01:48:38.850 --> 01:48:39.720
<v Speaker 5>it's like that video.</v>

4240
01:48:39.721 --> 01:48:40.440
<v Speaker 5>That dude,</v>

4241
01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:40.910
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

4242
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:45.270
<v Speaker 5>the two kids where it's like a Mexican kid with his socks pulled up to his knees</v>

4243
01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:47.610
<v Speaker 5>and there's some white kid in jeans and they're like,</v>

4244
01:48:47.611 --> 01:48:47.971
<v Speaker 5>come on.</v>

4245
01:48:47.971 --> 01:48:48.804
<v Speaker 5>And then the white,</v>

4246
01:48:48.810 --> 01:48:52.680
<v Speaker 5>the white kid clearly knows like some sort of Asian defense,</v>

4247
01:48:52.710 --> 01:48:55.490
<v Speaker 5>like starts doing steps and kicking practice kick in.</v>

4248
01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:56.221
<v Speaker 5>And the guy was like,</v>

4249
01:48:56.221 --> 01:48:56.461
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4250
01:48:56.461 --> 01:48:58.030
<v Speaker 5>no street fight street fight only.</v>

4251
01:48:58.410 --> 01:48:58.920
<v Speaker 5>And it was like,</v>

4252
01:48:58.920 --> 01:48:59.071
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4253
01:48:59.071 --> 01:48:59.581
<v Speaker 5>this is what I'm doing.</v>

4254
01:48:59.581 --> 01:48:59.851
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>

4255
01:48:59.851 --> 01:49:00.031
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

4256
01:49:00.031 --> 01:49:00.481
<v Speaker 5>no man.</v>

4257
01:49:00.481 --> 01:49:01.470
<v Speaker 5>I ain't doing that kind of shit.</v>

4258
01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:02.330
<v Speaker 5>No funky vice,</v>

4259
01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:03.300
<v Speaker 5>just regular fights.</v>

4260
01:49:05.010 --> 01:49:05.880
<v Speaker 5>It's all mine is on my,</v>

4261
01:49:05.881 --> 01:49:08.550
<v Speaker 5>it's one of my favorite fights I've favorited and all that youtube page,</v>

4262
01:49:08.551 --> 01:49:12.810
<v Speaker 5>like I favorited it that I'm fucking one of the first people to discover Kimbo</v>

4263
01:49:12.811 --> 01:49:13.380
<v Speaker 5>slice.</v>

4264
01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:14.750
<v Speaker 5>You know the beautiful thing about being around</v>

4265
01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:17.100
<v Speaker 6>people know how to fight isn't very rarely getting flights.</v>

4266
01:49:17.190 --> 01:49:19.870
<v Speaker 6>It's most people know how to fight our fucking pretty calm.</v>

4267
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:21.640
<v Speaker 6>They'd get all that shit out in the gym.</v>

4268
01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:22.120
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4269
01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:24.190
<v Speaker 6>you can get all that shit out in a controlled environment.</v>

4270
01:49:24.191 --> 01:49:26.710
<v Speaker 6>We have a desire for conflict.</v>

4271
01:49:26.711 --> 01:49:28.570
<v Speaker 6>We have a desire to fucking old come things,</v>

4272
01:49:28.650 --> 01:49:29.483
<v Speaker 6>fuck the car.</v>

4273
01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:30.910
<v Speaker 6>There's a desire of that,</v>

4274
01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:33.190
<v Speaker 6>that all that shit can be erased in the gym.</v>

4275
01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:34.810
<v Speaker 6>And when you erase it to the gym,</v>

4276
01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:39.100
<v Speaker 6>you deal with yourself on an even playing field instead of being overwhelmed by</v>

4277
01:49:39.101 --> 01:49:43.120
<v Speaker 6>road rage or overwhelmed by disappointment in your own personal life and</v>

4278
01:49:43.121 --> 01:49:46.390
<v Speaker 6>existence and whatever's frustrations that have been building inside of you,</v>

4279
01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:49.420
<v Speaker 6>percolating fucking up your physical existence.</v>

4280
01:49:49.421 --> 01:49:50.300
<v Speaker 6>Because the moment you're in,</v>

4281
01:49:50.301 --> 01:49:51.160
<v Speaker 6>in any interaction,</v>

4282
01:49:51.161 --> 01:49:52.630
<v Speaker 6>you're acting unbalanced.</v>

4283
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:53.290
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4284
01:49:53.290 --> 01:49:56.160
<v Speaker 6>walking down the street on the curb just staring at cars.</v>

4285
01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:56.410
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4286
01:49:56.410 --> 01:49:57.430
<v Speaker 6>The Fuck's wrong with you?</v>

4287
01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:00.070
<v Speaker 6>That's the guy from yet last night,</v>

4288
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:01.190
<v Speaker 6>what was he doing?</v>

4289
01:50:01.190 --> 01:50:02.480
<v Speaker 6>Saw Him walking on the curb,</v>

4290
01:50:02.580 --> 01:50:04.960
<v Speaker 6>just staring at cars and I was like,</v>

4291
01:50:04.961 --> 01:50:05.830
<v Speaker 6>he's probably crazy.</v>

4292
01:50:05.831 --> 01:50:07.420

01:53:05.581 --> 01:53:06.111
<v Speaker 6>if that's a word,</v>

4422
01:53:06.111 --> 01:53:07.490
<v Speaker 6>cause like Jj Walker,</v>

01:53:07.491 --> 01:53:08.510
<v Speaker 6>like when he got older,</v>

4424
01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:12.140

4425
01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:13.790
<v Speaker 6>They would hate it.</v>

4426
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.811
<v Speaker 6>Hate it.</v>

4427
01:53:14.811 --> 01:53:16.370
<v Speaker 6>Cause he wasn't doing that anymore.</v>

4428
01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:19.910
<v Speaker 6>Now he's just a standup up trying to make a living and apparently he didn't like</v>

4429
01:53:19.911 --> 01:53:21.020
<v Speaker 6>that when people,</v>

4430
01:53:21.350 --> 01:53:22.250
<v Speaker 6>that's what they say.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I never did it from,</v>

4432
01:53:23.690 --> 01:53:24.680
<v Speaker 6>maybe the guy loved it.</v>

4433
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:27.140
<v Speaker 6>Maybe one asshole did it say dynamite.</v>

4434
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:28.603
<v Speaker 6>Dynamite.</v>

4435
01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:29.301
<v Speaker 6>And he's like,</v>

4436
01:53:29.301 --> 01:53:30.350
<v Speaker 6>I don't like to do it.</v>

4437
01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:32.300
<v Speaker 6>But that would be weird though,</v>

4438
01:53:32.310 --> 01:53:35.510
<v Speaker 6>because I mean that's what kind of got everyone to know who he is.</v>

4439
01:53:35.511 --> 01:53:35.810
<v Speaker 6>That's how,</v>

4440
01:53:35.810 --> 01:53:37.420
<v Speaker 6>but after like 10 years,</v>

4441
01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:39.620
<v Speaker 6>man can stop saying dynamite,</v>

4442
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:41.930
<v Speaker 6>but an even worse than that.</v>

4443
01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:43.370
<v Speaker 6>Imagine being bobcat where you do the,</v>

4444
01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:46.680
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

4445
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:48.290
<v Speaker 6>I worked with him.</v>

4446
01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:49.131
<v Speaker 6>He stopped doing that,</v>

4447
01:53:49.131 --> 01:53:49.730
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4448
01:53:49.730 --> 01:53:50.001
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4449
01:53:50.001 --> 01:53:51.140

<v Speaker 6>I Dunno.</v>

4453
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:54.830
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it's like a goto thing with a joke.</v>

4454
01:53:54.831 --> 01:53:56.630
<v Speaker 6>Like subtly cause he's still doing stand up.</v>

4455
01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:57.561
<v Speaker 6>Can you still do a stand up?</v>

4456
