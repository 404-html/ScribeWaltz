1
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.930
Five four,
three,
two,
one

2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.640
<v 1>[inaudible] ladies and gentlemen and his brother Mike,
Mike Clarke,</v>

3
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:17.570
the second man to ever give me paid work ever in my entire professional career.

4
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:21.680
Opening up for Lenny,
Jay's and Pittsfield,
right?

5
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.310
Yeah,
I remember that one.
The photo Gig,

6
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.130
I don't even know if norms around anymore,

7
00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:31.360
but I remember that keg like it was yesterday.
That guy,

8
00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:35.930
I paid my rent many times.
Many times.
Guy.
And you did too.

9
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.680
Working for you paid.
My roommate I worked for,
I worked for Mike,

10
00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:42.890
one of the craziest gigs I ever did.
I think it was a one and done.

11
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:43.880
You never did it again.

12
00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:47.690
It was a restaurant and I was in the seating area and the microphone for the

13
00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:51.680
people when they announced their table was tied to the PA system

14
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.770
<v 0>in the middle of this punchline,
he'd be like,
so I said to the guy,</v>

15
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.530
Clark Party,
party to Clark or tables ready?

16
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.040
Oh No.
Was that,
that wasn't the Mexican place downtown?
No,
I wasn't Mexican place.

17
00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:10.360
Who was a seafood place.
Oh yeah.
I had a lot of one night.
It was back in the day.

18
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.871
Well,

19
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:14.500
that was the beautiful thing about being a comic and Boston is that if you lived

20
00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:17.640
in Boston,
you could go anywhere within like an hour,

21
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.830
two hours outside the city and work basically every weekend.

22
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.000
It was Tuesday through its shot,
Joe.
Yeah.

23
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.620
We will work seven nights a week at one point.
It was so much,
you know,

24
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.390
and,
and cash,
cash,
cash,
cash.
Well it was amazing,

25
00:01:34.391 --> 00:01:37.630
but it was also terrible because a lot of people were very bad with the taxes

26
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.330
and they,
uh,
I always put,
my mother told me,

27
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.380
don't fool around with the taxes or the mob.
You might've been the only guy.
Oh,

28
00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:48.130
I paid,
I pay.
Well,
you might've been the only guy.
Everybody else got hamstring.

29
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.070
Yup.
Knock.
She got killed.
Kenny got killed,
got killed.

30
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:54.010
And then when they got killed,
it was like hundreds of thousands.

31
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.250
It was because it was years and years and you know,

32
00:01:57.251 --> 00:02:01.090
and you've gotta make that up.
Like,
fuck y'all.
Yeah,
there's no getting out.

33
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.670
It's no good.
Now you wind up paying it for the rest of your life.

34
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.300
It's like student loans or something.
You know,
what are you doing out here?

35
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.940
What's going on?
Uh,
but when came out to do this justice,

36
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.040
no,
this a little bit more,
ah,
I was gonna do Kimmel,

37
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.680
but smells got so smells single mother.

38
00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:24.120
I'd like to fuck it was under show show to show you today's yeah.

39
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.740
And I pled Rocio Tanos love interest and I love,
I love bro Shit.

40
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.810
Rosie a break 35 years ago.
She never forgot it,
you know?

41
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.340
And she was always pretty great to me,

42
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.940
so we were going to do that and then it didn't pan out and they show got

43
00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:44.260
canceled.
So sexual impropriety or something,
it had nothing to do with me.
Oh,

44
00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:46.570
really?
That's why it got canceled.
Evidently.
I don't know.

45
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:49.200
I someone behind the scenes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

46
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.320
I don't know what happened to be that was the norm.
And now shows get canceled

47
00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.190
and now,
oh,
thank God they didn't have cameras.
Cell phones.
I'd still be doing

48
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.390
<v 2>time.
I forget forever.
You'll get me a demo going down to,
uh,</v>

49
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.140
to do the Navy Seals,
family foundation,
big fundraiser.
We do every year.

50
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.860
I said San Diego.
Yeah,
yeah.
Yeah.
Not a cornetto at a good party.

51
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:15.750
Vice Carrie Jackson says navy seal that we golf would one day and we'd been

52
00:03:15.751 --> 00:03:18.890
touched with ever since.
He's,
he's there.
The real bad ass.
Yeah.

53
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.470
Core Nanos that island,
right?
Yes.
I've never been.
Oh yeah.
It's beautiful.

54
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.340
I went down and Mike it due to an obstacle courses sell.
Right.

55
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:28.650
So I climbed the rope.
That was,

56
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.040
so then there's these logs and they're going to have the logs up there.

57
00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:34.300
I've run a quick,
there was spinning logs that one time,
nearly broke my back.

58
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:37.980
That was it.
I was out of step on them.
Yep.
Yes.
Running [inaudible]

59
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.180
as you're running across.
So yeah,
it's not easy.
It's not an answer.

60
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.120
You have a mouthpiece.
No.
And not because it seems like

61
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.310
the only ones out there.
Yeah.
Well that core Natto island,

62
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:55.240
I think that's what Dick Cheney lives.
Oh yeah.
A lot of,
or Donald Rumsfeld.

63
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:58.450
One of them rich warmonger type dudes.
Yeah.
There's a lot of,

64
00:03:58.451 --> 00:03:59.440
a lot of money out there.

65
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.390
I was sitting rumps sells office at the Pentagon to just cross on.
Well,
no,

66
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.171
but you know,

67
00:04:05.171 --> 00:04:09.120
my buddy who was with me was reading this stuff on his desk because he can,

68
00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:11.770
he's a contractor.
We can read upside down,
you know?

69
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.340
And so really there's God marine.

70
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.750
Whenever realize what he was doing came up governor,
I said,
what did you seek?

71
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.593
It's not good.

72
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.370
It's amazing that those guys are still alive.
Oh yeah.
Especially Cheney.

73
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.870
And he's got somebody else's,
a heart inside of them.
Yeah.
I mean,

74
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.380
in the end he had the person killed for that hat.
That's what I used to do it.

75
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.140
I used to do a bit about it,
how he had an extra secret service agent.

76
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.270
It was only eating like vegetables,
how to jog every day.
It's like,

77
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:47.950
what the fuck?
Why do I have to do all this stuff?
It's good.
Good.
Everyone.

78
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.080
When Dick has a heart attack,

79
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:54.490
they open that guy off like a fish was still beating heart out.
Yeah.
He,

80
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:57.940
he had a pump inside of his body at one point in time where he didn't have a

81
00:04:57.941 --> 00:05:02.530
heartbeat because he had this crazy pumped.
It would just circled the blood,

82
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.680
but there was no,
don't,
don't,
don't,
don't.
So someone checked his heartbeat,

83
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:09.970
they would think he's dead.
There was no heartbeat.
Wow.
So he could fake dead.

84
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.250
You could take that in a bad situation.
Monster movie.
Wow.
I had a,

85
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.000
I had the opposite problem I had,
I was doing a show and they made,
you know,

86
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.470
he had to go,
when you do a network show,

87
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:23.620
they made you have a physical physically.
Yeah.

88
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.880
So I went in and the guy goes,
oh my God.
He goes,
what?
He goes,
you feel okay?

89
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:31.180
I feel great.
It's your heart is beating 283 beats a minute.
And I go,

90
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.680
isn't said that like a professional egos.
That's like a dead man.
You Moron.

91
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.210
So he said,
ah,
this is horrible.
283 beats a minute.
Yeah.
Yeah.

92
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:44.750
Like your po like crazy.
Like we'd go on,
written down.
Yeah,
yeah,

93
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.360
yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
what would they stay?
Rushed me to a hospital.
But before they did,

94
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:53.260
I said,
hey man,
I really need this job.
You know,
if I give you some money,
he goes,

95
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.030
are you trying to bribe me?
I go,
yeah,
we gotta be dead Nigga.

96
00:05:58.031 --> 00:06:01.120
If I don't have this job,
I don't want to live.
I need the job,
you know?

97
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.380
So they rushed me in and then they,
uh,

98
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:07.940
I ate trivia fibrillation and then it was both sides and I hold the record for

99
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:12.230
being jumpstarted,
you know,
when they defibrillations Yep.
The mass general.
Yeah.

100
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:14.750
It's like a phone book.
How many times they're doing it over a hundred.

101
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.830
They restarted you a hundred times.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You see the future.

102
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.520
Are you willing to do the original pitch and show Jesus while they finally,

103
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.910
they finally did the ablation where they go in and they burned the part that's

104
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:31.970
flapping and they found out the other side was flapping too.
So they,

105
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.780
it was like eight hours on the table had this great doctor,
my friend,
uh,

106
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.190
you know Everlast from the house of Payne?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He's got a fake one.

107
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.530
So he takes the microphone and puts it up to his chest and it goes click,
click,

108
00:06:43.531 --> 00:06:46.100
click,
click,
click,
click,
click,
click,
click,
click,
click,
click.

109
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.480
It's got like a fake valve in there.
Well,
I'll titanium val.
It's really creepy.

110
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.920
Wow.
Puts the microphone right there.
I'm hear it.
You can hear it through the mic.

111
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.720
Oh my God.
It was crazy.

112
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.880
I didn't know I was,
it was asymptomatic,
you know,
and I said to the doctor,

113
00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:05.450
I said,
well,
what do you think of is,
well,
you know,

114
00:07:05.451 --> 00:07:08.490
your weight probably has something to do.
I said,
well,
I did a lot of blowing.

115
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.140
Gosh,
you'd have to do credible Amotz employees.
Well,
there's a small mountain,

116
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:16.110
the Peru mission that much,
Lynn,
I got that much of that,

117
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:17.870
of that fucking the whole crew.
I mean,

118
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:21.170
Sweeney and I talked about it when he did the show,
that whole crew,

119
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:25.700
that nick comedy stopped crew was a coke came or fucking extravaganza.

120
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:29.990
Oh yeah.
It was very fortunate that I did that.
Didn't still have never did coke.

121
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.220
Oh,
it was Joe Joe.
I don't like don't.
I went to Columbia,
see where it was made.

122
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.790
Yeah.
I was going,
oh my God,
what a wine tour.

123
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.470
Two days to score.
Well,
yeah.
They said we sent it off to America.

124
00:07:45.471 --> 00:07:46.304
Mr Linny.
I go,

125
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:52.060
there's got to be a new shipment and then I got an ounce of blow for $200 I had

126
00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:55.700
a lot,
I couldn't even finish it in a week,
you know,
but I've tried.

127
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.620
And how much is an ounce of blow?
What does it look like?

128
00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.070
You know what I'm Scott face thing.
Know Scott bigger than that.

129
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.250
That's like 28 grams in,

130
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.350
but an ounce of pot is like,
yeah,
yeah.
With that much.

131
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.650
I was at the same thing with coke that were bigger.
Same bigger to me.

132
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.190
I had it everywhere.
Yeah,
I remember the car.
I said,
Lenny,

133
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:18.220
you have to decide whether it's a coke at me.
I said,

134
00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:21.800
do you want to live for the road?
I know what happened,
but

135
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:28.000
it was amazing.
I really enjoyed Colombia.
But uh,
did you go there just for coke?

136
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:33.020
Yeah.
No,
no.
I went back recently,
a couple of years ago,

137
00:08:33.021 --> 00:08:37.930
I went to do a,
uh,
upper notice.
They were filming a movie and,

138
00:08:37.931 --> 00:08:40.810
uh,
they asked me to come down and I went down there and I went,

139
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.540
I remember some of this,
you know,
but I was doing it now,

140
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:47.010
but saw Spanish.
No,
I had no where to run lines.

141
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:54.020
When did you stop doing it?
22 years ago.
Wow.
23.

142
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.080
Wow.
Yeah,
that's a good amount of time.
What had to,
you know,

143
00:08:58.081 --> 00:09:00.850
I was doing this movie and uh,

144
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.930
I've finished the guy,

145
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.220
I had patrolled this guy through a wall and I really liked the guy,
you know,
and,

146
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.640
and I didn't want to hurt him and he said,
no,
no,
you gotta.

147
00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:14.310
So I put him through the wall and took a door off the hinges and he said,
Lenny,

148
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:17.240
we don't own that though.
This is what he bulges place.
I go,
hey man,

149
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:21.210
I'm done after today.
You know,
someone's going to pay yet.
So the guy I got,

150
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.240
I finished and I bought a bag of blow and whiskey and the bag of dope and some

151
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:29.540
beers.
And guys you happy?
Like I said,
yeah,
if you want to get real happy.
I said,

152
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.680
you don't scare me,
so we'll pick up at 6:00 AM.

153
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.910
So I went back to the hotel and met my buddy,
which out to buddy we went out.

154
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.690
He said,
let's see how many bugs we can go to before they charge us for boots,

155
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:41.040
you know,
to hey,
why don't you,
yeah,
he said it was.

156
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:46.400
So we ended up at the tall ships down at the fender hall and the guy didn't know

157
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:48.990
me,
so we paid,
we said,
we'll stay here.

158
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.880
Then he realized who I was and we drank free,

159
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.810
went back and were doing blow in the door,
banks opening week free.
Saudi said,

160
00:09:55.811 --> 00:09:58.920
what did he said the guys,
come on,
we're going to go into like a rave.

161
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:04.130
And it took me to an AA meeting in South Boston and uh,

162
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.700
it just,
it clicked,
you know,
I thought it was a CAG.

163
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:11.120
I the blow with me and it's come on once it all lines,
which just listen,
listen,

164
00:10:11.121 --> 00:10:15.330
this is after a bender after.
Why?
During a Penta,
I just don't like it.

165
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.490
Well on me and I thought it was a rave.
I thought we were going great.
Great.

166
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.980
Phil Barrier?
No,
he was my,
he's still my sponsor today.
Wow.

167
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.010
This young kid and you know,
I said,
well you know,

168
00:10:26.011 --> 00:10:28.350
how'd you get nice and did you have a problem?

169
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.980
He says that he's still with the banks with a shotgun.
Everyone on the floor.

170
00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:35.940
I go,
Dad,
you can be my sponsor.
Wow.
This thing Joe,

171
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.200
we got sober together.
Yeah,
I mean died the same day.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

172
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.740
Wow.
23 years.
Yeah.

173
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.040
That was the thing about that whole Boston crews.
It,

174
00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:49.620
it was all kind of tied to drugs.
Oh.

175
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:54.630
And the comedy had that feel to it because the comedy was frantic,

176
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.210
you know,
and there was a thing,
Bang,
Bang,
Bang.

177
00:10:57.211 --> 00:10:59.280
There was the thing about the guys who came out of Boston,

178
00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:02.810
like still to this day,
they had like the fastest paced,

179
00:11:02.811 --> 00:11:06.410
the most punch marks and the audience is there were used to that.

180
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:11.510
Any bullshit and it would tell you they would if you weren't good,
you sucked.

181
00:11:11.511 --> 00:11:15.180
And I get off and we would have,
but it was,

182
00:11:15.181 --> 00:11:18.620
there were times when I'd say,
this is going to be new material,
man.

183
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.080
Anyone who doesn't do new material the minute you do anything you've done
before,

184
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:23.070
get off the stage.

185
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.310
So Raj snippy shit at the back and some you've done that beam,

186
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.550
throw a shot glass with shadow on the wall.

187
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.650
Next it was and it made you come and the people,
the,
like you said,

188
00:11:34.651 --> 00:11:38.850
the audience is that came in there would come every week.
So you'd have to,

189
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.660
and they would not settle for any bullshit,
you know that blows,
that's no good.

190
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.310
Yeah,
there was a,
there was a whole scene.
There wasn't just the comics.

191
00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:48.990
It was like comedy kind of soars.

192
00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.980
There was so many people that came to those clubs.
That's shows pull it up,

193
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.400
puts shows that with legendary will the Ding Ho on a Wednesday night,

194
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:02.440
Lenny would put like 32 acts on [inaudible] of all I'd go,

195
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:05.620
Lynn,
you know,
we've got to get the show.
Oh shut up.

196
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:07.920
I got a couple more guys and want to give a break too.

197
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.150
And not have guys going on until two in the morning and a liquor license that

198
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:15.820
told the cops a couple,
Lenny,
you got,
you got to stop.

199
00:12:15.821 --> 00:12:18.080
And I go have a drink and we'll finish up.
You know,

200
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:22.060
first the first night he took over when Cremins left,

201
00:12:22.061 --> 00:12:26.530
Cremins was leaving and a Jesus job,

202
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.200
well 85 86 somewhere around there.

203
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:34.690
I thought it closed at 84 I could be wrong on the,
I don't know,

204
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.910
it was shuttles before my,
I came in 88 you know you're right.

205
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:43.540
Probably probably around 84 I took over from Barry and she suddenly says to me,

206
00:12:43.541 --> 00:12:46.840
hey man,
batteries leave him.
Will you stay for me?
I'll double your pay.
And I go,

207
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:51.040
yeah,
all right,
I'll stay.
It's a 15 to $30 right at the time,
you know,

208
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:55.930
and he says,
you,
you run the club.
I go,
oh no man,
I'm the,
I'll get a guy.

209
00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:58.960
He goes,
cause my little brother,
he just got laid off and pull the right and go,

210
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:00.970
well what if he screws us?
I said,
if he screws us,

211
00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:02.230
I'll tell my mother will be fine.

212
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.060
So he comes in and the first thing he says to Shoney's I,
the food sucks.

213
00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:08.950
Close the back room close to the restaurant.

214
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.430
We'll get to make that a show room too.
So you'd open the front room,

215
00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.230
you go through the kitchen and do a show in the backroom.

216
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.350
Then you'd come back then and wait till it,
and we started,

217
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:20.260
we were doing six shows a night,
but the first night he comes in,

218
00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.960
I was pretty lit up because you're not going on tonight.
You're drunk.
And I go,

219
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:27.430
fuck you man.
Yo that little brother.
I just got get a fucking job.
Fuck you.

220
00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:31.270
I'll do whatever I want.
Blah Blah Blah.
So he gets Gavin and it go,
come on man,

221
00:13:31.271 --> 00:13:33.740
let's go into cool the [inaudible] cool.

222
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:37.270
We're doing a lot each and gab cause I'll be right back.
I go out and hey click.

223
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.950
The Fricks locked me.
He was so high.
I said,

224
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:44.650
you're not going on tonight.
They locked me in the cooler.

225
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:49.960
And so I said,
I'll show them.
I started fucking drink and everything.

226
00:13:49.961 --> 00:13:54.040
And passed out there to get me out of it.
I can't do it.

227
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.940
I apologize.
Okay.
You were right.
But he turned that into a gold mine.

228
00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:00.790
We'd be doing six shows a night.
Three in the front,
three in the back.

229
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.790
Who Sweeney said to the guy lost it in a gambling.
Yeah.
Yeah.

230
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:08.870
He just someplace Chinese dominoes over in China town and he didn't pay his food

231
00:14:08.951 --> 00:14:13.180
tax.
And so I guess a year and a half later they came and locked it up.

232
00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:17.560
But first they came and he would send a kid out to a liquor store to buy boots

233
00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:22.090
because they took all the bullets.
So we'd have to buy booze for that night.

234
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:27.130
And then after that they did came and they took the chairs.
They took the tables.

235
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.790
But yeah,
he lost everything.
But it was Wednesday night.
Lenny,

236
00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.980
Thursday night Dj has it Friday night,
Don Galvin,
Saturday night,

237
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:40.470
Cremins and Sweeney on Sunday night,
they go,
just kill a show.

238
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.600
And what people don't know is that Boston had a different way of doing it.

239
00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:46.390
So if it was the Lenny Clarke show,
Lenny would host the show,

240
00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.820
right when he would go on,
you would do like what,

241
00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:50.280
10 15 minutes or something like that.

242
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:54.400
We're supposed to hit opened would 40 you know why?

243
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:58.280
You know why I came up with that joke?
That was my idea because yeah,

244
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.190
because it used to be,
you know,

245
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.910
Mitt opening midlife closer and I was always a closing.
I'm going,
hey man,

246
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:09.920
if I hosted I can do lights and smoke dope in between the guys.

247
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:10.730
And I said,

248
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:14.830
well if someone has a bad set and I could pick it up or I can be the buffer

249
00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:16.900
while they get over that guy go.

250
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:21.080
And it just took off and it was a great way of doing it.
It really was.

251
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.950
And then you would kind of close it too,
right?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh absolutely.
Yeah.

252
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.270
I mean,
you know did with different nights,
different crowds too,
like Gav,

253
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.350
like I,
I was always working Wednesdays and I'd be other clubs,

254
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.100
but I was wondering what cab show cause calf had a great show and they didn't

255
00:15:37.101 --> 00:15:41.390
like me.
I was like,
cabs crowd did not go for me.
They hated me and I said,

256
00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:42.470
what the fuck?
You know what I mean?

257
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:46.430
It was a hole and I had to learn to adapt to different audience.
It goes,

258
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:51.530
what was the difference between Gavin's crowd that Gav used to say it was more

259
00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.410
uh,
they were smart.
Smart.

260
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.140
I mean he was a smart motherfucker.
Oh yeah,

261
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:02.390
he's got a couple of masters.
Yeah,
he's a genius.

262
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.400
His fucking comedy was so sharp.
He would have punchlines.

263
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.170
You never saw a comment on top of punchlines.
You never saw her.

264
00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:12.500
You are recoverable from the last punchline that he would hit you with another

265
00:16:12.501 --> 00:16:15.590
wall.
Yeah,
it was the first time I saw him.

266
00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:18.890
He came on and I watched him and I said to him after shot,

267
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.800
how long you been doing this?
Because it's my first time.
I mean,
you know,

268
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.930
fucking lying.
Well,
not off to a good start,
right?

269
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.070
Like it was like what competitive.
It was really competitive.

270
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:31.580
And One night I was doing a show with him at,

271
00:16:31.581 --> 00:16:34.480
some guy came on stage behind me.
He was coming up behind me.

272
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.210
Gav jumped over this railing and escorted the guy off and I said,

273
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.980
and that was pretty cool because I got your back.

274
00:16:39.981 --> 00:16:44.270
And then we drove home to his place,
but it was like three days getting high.

275
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:48.530
And we've been friends ever since.
But it's funny because he said to me,
he goes,

276
00:16:48.531 --> 00:16:51.350
let me,
I can ask you a question.
He goes,
if you could be

277
00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.190
the richest person or the most famous person,
what would it be?

278
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.300
Oh without a doubt.
The most famous.
He goes,
really?
He goes,
okay,

279
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.180
six weeks later ISCAF I thought about it.
You're right.

280
00:17:02.181 --> 00:17:05.870
I'd rather be the righteous,
the frame shifts but bunch of bullshit.
And he goes,

281
00:17:05.871 --> 00:17:08.930
well I'm glad you came around and see what I mean by smarter.
Yeah,
he's nuts.

282
00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:12.650
If you're the most famous person,
you just going to get stocked every wall.

283
00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.320
It's hard though.
It'd be that dude that nobody knows as well.

284
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:20.390
Cause you know I have five billionaire friends,
billion,
not million.
Billion.

285
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.980
Their friends.
Yeah.
And I think I'm like that,
you know,

286
00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:29.140
their pet pet pet project,
you know.
But I mean,
it's unbelievable.
I mean,

287
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.360
to,
to live like that,
you know,
not show billions they've got,

288
00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:34.090
have you ever seen that?
No.
Never.
So it's,

289
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.430
these guys are just like that more money then you can spend more than you could

290
00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:40.370
spend.
Yeah.
That's a weird life.
Yeah.
And we're like,

291
00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:44.300
where everybody else is struggling,
but no one knows him.
Don't you know?
Well,

292
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:48.590
some of them people know,
you know,
but these people are like anonymous.

293
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.010
And if money than you could ever,

294
00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:54.790
<v 0>Jeff,
very clever.
God's,
Oh yeah,
that's,
oh,
that's what I haven't liked that.
Yeah.</v>

295
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.510
And even if you were a comic,
you'd rather just do clubs.

296
00:17:57.511 --> 00:18:01.590
Just show up and do clubs and just do a set.
Once you're on stage telling jokes,

297
00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:04.230
either they laugh or they don't laugh.
If you're funny,
you'll kill.

298
00:18:04.231 --> 00:18:06.420
It doesn't matter if you're famous,
you know,
I would like to,

299
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:11.400
I wouldn't like to be,
I like doing the,
it is now because it's a different crowd.

300
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.130
You know,
I,
I still do a lot of clubs.

301
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:18.120
I've worked Mike's club all the time that got for him.
But thank that car for me.

302
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.500
Keeps me open some,
there's some people,
you know how when you work the club,

303
00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:25.620
you get some drunk.
All it takes is one person.
Yeah,

304
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.990
because I still go with the flow.
I mean,

305
00:18:27.991 --> 00:18:29.070
I really wouldn't know what I'm gonna do.

306
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.890
I'm just going to go and I try to keep it,
you know what,

307
00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.990
what's happening in the news today and somewhat of Jess Baby,
we're going to go,

308
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:40.680
oh man,
they break the rhythm,
you know,
and I want to stab him.
You know,
he can't.

309
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:43.650
Well,
it doesn't always happen though.
That's the thing.
It does happen,

310
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:45.810
but it doesn't always mean that I need the time.
It's great.

311
00:18:45.811 --> 00:18:50.220
But Len just can't block it out.
You know,
it's,
it's,
he's doing it.

312
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.610
No one there locks that are worse than Depaulo.
Oh,

313
00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:57.150
you don't even have to say anything.

314
00:18:57.151 --> 00:19:00.510
You just have a look on your face that he doesn't like what you don't think.

315
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:03.750
This is funny to whisper in a saw mill.

316
00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.660
I'm working with nick with doing some comedy tour up to Rato or some and maybe

317
00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:14.380
autism,
some shit,
all that.
And I was looking at him,
uh,

318
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:18.480
I was hosting,
I'm looking at him and he,
he,
I think we smoked at the time.
It,

319
00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.790
it was a dark,
dingy club and it looked like watch and Lenny Bruce,

320
00:19:23.791 --> 00:19:25.980
it was just like that.
So I'm laughing too.

321
00:19:25.981 --> 00:19:30.510
I step outside the room and this is a pregnant woman goes,
oh my God.
Oh my God.

322
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.600
He,
I really enjoyed you,
but he's going to make me have my paper.

323
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.800
Oh.
But he's so fun.
He's a funny motherfucker and he,
he,

324
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.610
he's been going crazy lately cause the Mueller Mueller report got released and

325
00:19:44.611 --> 00:19:46.890
he said that there was no collusion between Trump and the Russian.

326
00:19:46.891 --> 00:19:50.760
So all of his Twitter,
all of his Instagram was just attack and liberals,

327
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.310
don't you fucking,
why do you care?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can't retire.

328
00:19:56.311 --> 00:20:00.890
You Lion.
It's just like,
that's so crazy.
Resign.

329
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.650
He's,
he's so crazy.
He put a gun.
He's telling people to put a gun in their mouth.

330
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.660
Isn't that how we got kicked off within the first serious?
Oh yeah,
yeah.

331
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.130
You're just telling people to kill them.
So He's,
yeah,

332
00:20:11.131 --> 00:20:15.950
he's doing that now on Twitter.
He's such a fucking animal.
It's always been,

333
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:20.900
oh hilarious.
He kills me every time.
Brilliant joke.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

334
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:25.770
He was a guy that made me sink like,
oh,
okay,
you don't have to be like a,

335
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.230
a little skinny guy to do standup.

336
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.660
Cause like he was this big back in the day he was playing football.
Yeah.

337
00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:36.630
He's a handsome guy.
And I was like,
oh,
I had to do was be fine.

338
00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:39.990
Women loved them and he would just shit on them and they love him even more than

339
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:46.280
Nikki.
Nikki was pretty funny to start,
you know,
I would always have him,
you know,

340
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.190
he was having good shows and he just,

341
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.980
he was out at the clubs every night and he just put end.

342
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.820
He was always angry from the beginning,
from the beginning,

343
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:58.330
I had them on news radio,
we played my brother and you know,

344
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.780
DePaul has always had this attitude that everyone is trying to fuck them over.

345
00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:07.750
Even then I got him this gig and it's almost like he made it happen.
Like,

346
00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.170
uh,
it was him and Brian Cowen and Epstein from welcome back.

347
00:21:11.171 --> 00:21:14.650
Kotter will play my brothers.
And on the episode they beat the fuck out of me.

348
00:21:14.651 --> 00:21:18.070
We all beat the fuck out of each other.
Broke bottles over ahead.
Uh,

349
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.020
Brian Count threw me through a window.

350
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.090
And before the thing was cast,
I had told the producer,
I said,

351
00:21:25.091 --> 00:21:29.230
I got this comic.
He's hilarious.
I go,
he looks like he could be my brother,
let,

352
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.170
let's,
let's hire him.
And he was,
yeah,
perfect.
He goes,

353
00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:35.350
can you read so I can see the read.
So he comes in and reads and he goes,
yeah,

354
00:21:35.351 --> 00:21:38.680
he's great.
Perfect.
But the casting agent had different ideas.

355
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:43.060
She had a friend who she,
yeah,
so she,

356
00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.950
she cast this other guy,

357
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:49.270
unbeknownst that I'd already made a deal with the producer and the show runner.

358
00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.750
And so,
uh,
they call nick up and tell them that he didn't get the Gig.

359
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:55.720
And he's like,
what the fuck?
I didn't get up fucking king.
And I go,
no,
no,
no.

360
00:21:55.721 --> 00:22:00.230
You got the Gig.
It was,
hey,
fucking just told me I don't have to fly
so high.

361
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.330
Make the phone call and find out what happened and you know,
and she's like,
well,

362
00:22:04.331 --> 00:22:06.640
I already hired my friend and go,
you weren't supposed to hire your friend.

363
00:22:06.641 --> 00:22:09.750
Like what are you doing?
Right?
And she's like,
well,
I just,
you know,

364
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.000
I don't know what to do.
I already hired this guy.
Go,
we'll tell him he's fired.

365
00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.570
Like this is real simple.
Like the producer wants it,
the network wants him.

366
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.470
And so nick came back and nick got the part and he couldn't believe it.

367
00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.280
He was like,
it worked out.
Like he was on the side.
He's like,

368
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:24.790
you mean the world's not fucking me over.

369
00:22:24.791 --> 00:22:29.140
I go into it and told my friend I wanted you on the shelf.
And it worked out,

370
00:22:29.141 --> 00:22:32.230
but it was like he was convinced he was going to get fucked over.

371
00:22:32.231 --> 00:22:34.960
He got fucked over.
He's like,
I knew it then.

372
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.710
And then he got the Gig and he's like,
what?
What is happening?
Uh Oh,

373
00:22:38.711 --> 00:22:41.560
he's just going up here on the show.
Great.
I love them.
I love that guy.
To death.

374
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.050
You know,
I,
I enjoy one.

375
00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:48.340
You hear stories about people remembering where they came from and they help

376
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.620
people out.
And when I was doing,

377
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:55.180
I just don't have the Sunday comics had Fox and uh,
it wasn't,

378
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.680
it didn't start out well.
I always wanted to go into,
tend to troops.

379
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.470
But when I got Lenny with CBS,
they said,
no,

380
00:23:00.471 --> 00:23:02.290
yet you have $1 million property and not going anywhere.

381
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.980
So when the troops came home,
I had show it got canceled.

382
00:23:04.981 --> 00:23:07.710
That's a whole nother different story.
I want to talk about that story.
Oh yeah.

383
00:23:07.711 --> 00:23:12.130
Oh yeah.
Oh,
it's good.
It's interesting.
It's a great story.
So I,
uh,

384
00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:17.560
I go to two 29 pounds marine base.
We pull up in a limo,
we blow anything up,

385
00:23:17.561 --> 00:23:20.470
down and anything doubt up.
And I said,
I'm going to like this place.

386
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.440
So we go into,
in George Lopez and judgmental,
a couple of comics.

387
00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:28.840
So I go up to Jeff Altman and he's the host and I go to shake his head and he

388
00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:32.050
blows me,
hey,
it gives me an a high hat wash away.
And I go,
oh,
what's this?

389
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:37.090
So they say later in the show,
they said,
listen Jeff,
we have this kid,

390
00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:40.630
I've got a purple heart.
He's back now and we want to unite them with his mother.

391
00:23:40.631 --> 00:23:44.230
And he goes,
that's kind of corny.
And he walks off,
I go,
I'll do it.
And so I go,

392
00:23:44.231 --> 00:23:45.540
hey,
how you doing?
Uh,

393
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.200
<v 2>police smile.
You know,
Ma,
I missed my family.</v>

394
00:23:48.201 --> 00:23:51.190
Well that's great cause we brought your mother and to be like,
yeah,
hey,

395
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.310
the crowd goes crazy.
And they said,
you want his job?
I said,
yeah,

396
00:23:55.311 --> 00:23:59.180
give me a dollar more than him.
And I took over the Sunday comics at night.
Wow.

397
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:00.370
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I mean,

398
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:05.680
and so then they say we go from like a hundred to seven in the ratings and they

399
00:24:06.021 --> 00:24:07.940
said,
what do you want?
I said,
I want you to hide this kid,

400
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.150
Kenny Rogers and his my head writer and get what's you written?
I said,

401
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:15.530
we wrote me a couple of letters from prison and once a month,
no,
I'm serious.

402
00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.810
You told me what I want,
this is what I want.
So they hired them.

403
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:18.930
And they fly him out.

404
00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.730
I pick them up at the airport and we drive to my place in Marina del Rey and he

405
00:24:21.731 --> 00:24:23.780
goes,
which floor with I owe all of them.
You know,

406
00:24:23.781 --> 00:24:26.660
I was living in like a $3 million place at the time.
And he goes,

407
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.690
this is incredible.
So we get jammed up for three days.

408
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.060
The third day he comes down,
he's all bagged up because Lenny,
he goes,

409
00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:37.880
I love you man.
But he goes,
I got a wife,
a kid,
now I can't fuck this up.

410
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.870
I really needed the job.
I said,
okay,
all right,
we'll go to work.
So we drive,

411
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:46.030
we drive down to Fox and we put,

412
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.420
kept my pocket space at the top of the roof.
It's great.

413
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.730
And we'll go and buy a current affair,
which used to be my report,
which is,

414
00:24:51.731 --> 00:24:53.390
you said you people suck.

415
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.210
You shouldn't even have all these officers and kitty holds water.
I said,
well,

416
00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.350
killing him in a radius.
They get all the split.
So we go down and uh,

417
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:01.880
I said to my secretary,
hold on my,

418
00:25:01.881 --> 00:25:04.760
cause we go in my office and there's three couch.
She said,
why three couches?

419
00:25:04.761 --> 00:25:07.820
I said,
when people come over they might want a nap,
right?
So then they said,
okay,

420
00:25:07.821 --> 00:25:09.110
Mr [inaudible],
they're ready for Kenny.

421
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.420
So I bring Kenny here to meet the producers.
And I said,

422
00:25:11.421 --> 00:25:15.170
just come by the office when you're done.
So 20 minutes later he comes,

423
00:25:15.171 --> 00:25:18.560
person is my office.
You know,
I can't believe it.
You're the fucking boss.

424
00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:21.320
You know what they told me?
My job is to make you happy.

425
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.250
Oh God.
He was great.
Well that show was a great show,

426
00:25:28.251 --> 00:25:32.690
but there was a crazy thing attached to that with your agent that wound up

427
00:25:32.691 --> 00:25:37.190
fucking over.
Not just you,
but a slew of people.
One Guy,

428
00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.940
Bob Williams.
Oh boy.
What was it?
Star agencies.
I would a book.

429
00:25:40.941 --> 00:25:44.960
What the fuck was the name?
Like spotlight on?
Yeah.
Oh,
he fucked everybody.

430
00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:49.820
At least Seinfeld too.
But sign,
I don't think Seinfeld and well,

431
00:25:49.821 --> 00:25:54.350
when I popped,
when I get Lenny and I was making all sorts of money,
they should,

432
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.980
you need an agent.
I said I want Seinfeld and Leno's agent,
you know,

433
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.530
and at the same time that he was doing both of them,

434
00:26:00.531 --> 00:26:04.670
so I figured these guys are the biggest guys in the business and he screwed
them,

435
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.840
but they got their money back.
I was like the lowest guy on the totem pole.

436
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:12.960
So I know I get screwed by $2 million.
Jesus.
I mean,

437
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:16.020
it was bad.
I remember people were trying to keep you from killing me.
Yeah,

438
00:26:16.021 --> 00:26:18.020
I went,
I found out where his kids went to school and everything,
you know,

439
00:26:18.021 --> 00:26:21.950
but he can't do that.
You know,
you got to let it go.
But it took a long,

440
00:26:21.951 --> 00:26:24.890
whatever it happens.
That guy still in the business country,

441
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.490
he's in country music.
Oh,
they didn't know.
They didn't get the memo

442
00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.680
far.
Oh yeah,
it was.
I was,
I was,
I was so pissed.
I mean,

443
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.310
because not only did I have the show,

444
00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:41.750
but when I went there,
everything was going good.

445
00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:46.220
And,
uh,
I invited Barry Diller to,

446
00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:49.110
to at Fox,
he was the head of Fox at the time.

447
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.830
I would throw a party for the entire cash,
the crew,
everyone at Fox.

448
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:54.510
And they all showed up.

449
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:59.130
And W I showcased a bunch of my friends so they could get jobs.

450
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:03.060
And Barry Diller goes,
you've really done a great job for us.
I said,

451
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.330
I really love,
you know,
working with you,
Mr. And he said,
okay.

452
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:08.990
So later in the night this,
uh,

453
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.420
this Asian man came up to me,
he goes,
you know,

454
00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:16.260
everyone likes you but I don't get it.
And I said,
well,
stick around,

455
00:27:16.261 --> 00:27:20.580
hop seeing you,
we'll catch you on.
And I didn't think anything of it.

456
00:27:20.581 --> 00:27:22.020
The next morning I,

457
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:26.700
they'd give me like a million dollar bonus and they raised my,
uh,

458
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:30.300
my weekly salary.
I mean,
it was a lot of money.
He was like over 2 million bucks.

459
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.690
And I was going to Dallas to do the tech deck.

460
00:27:33.691 --> 00:27:38.120
Texas state fair would one of the men stasis,
not,
not,

461
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.220
uh,
Earlene or the other one is just some crazy name.

462
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:45.540
And I landed in Dallas and he calls me,
he says,
I got good news and bad news.

463
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:46.710
I said,
give me the badness.
He goes,

464
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.760
did you have a problem with a Chinese guy last night?
I said,
no.
Oh yeah,
yeah,

465
00:27:50.761 --> 00:27:54.980
I guess so.
I guess.
Well that's Barry Diller's right hand man you had done,
they,

466
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:58.020
they throw you off the lot.
They said,
I said,
what's the good news here?

467
00:27:58.021 --> 00:28:02.160
We got your money.
And they go,
I want my job.
I said,
let me apologize to the guy.

468
00:28:02.161 --> 00:28:04.260
I didn't mean it.
I didn't know.
And they go,
no,

469
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:07.830
they've already taken all this stuff out of your office and put it in boxes and

470
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.400
you're done.
And now I do the state fair and I'm going,
man,

471
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:16.280
this sucks.
You know what I mean?
I want to get back to la to try and salvage,

472
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.300
you know,
the career,
you know,
cause I mean,

473
00:28:18.301 --> 00:28:22.440
this is enough that work that I'm the longer welcome at just from one

474
00:28:22.441 --> 00:28:27.030
conversation co I've got stories.
I wish I'd never opened my mouth.
I mean,
I've,

475
00:28:27.031 --> 00:28:31.820
I've,
yeah,
no one's as,
as fucked up my life more than myself and unintentional.

476
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.050
So,
uh,
what we're doing,

477
00:28:34.051 --> 00:28:39.051
the state fair and this horse with a buckboard goes out of control and the horse

478
00:28:41.181 --> 00:28:44.910
is swing and a buck.
What's coming towards the reviewing stand?
So I grabbed him,

479
00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.710
man dro girls,
and get a ride with,
just as the whole thing is wiped out.

480
00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.250
And I'm saying,
did you get that?
Did they get that on tape?
But that was a,

481
00:28:53.251 --> 00:28:55.080
that was the end of my career at Fox.

482
00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.110
That was crazy from one conversation where a guy said,
he didn't like you.

483
00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.150
How about this?
Um,
but when I'm,
I'm at,

484
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.750
I have Lenny at CBS and it was doing good.

485
00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:07.260
And then the quit the Gulf War came out that,
that,
that killed me.

486
00:29:07.261 --> 00:29:10.890
And then they brought me back and we were hanging on by a thread and they said,

487
00:29:10.891 --> 00:29:14.070
listen,
forget about the show.
We think you're a great actor.

488
00:29:14.071 --> 00:29:16.890
Let's give you a movie deal.
Really?
He says,
yeah,

489
00:29:16.891 --> 00:29:19.890
we're going to give you the first picture,
$2 million.

490
00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:23.130
And then the next picture it'd be uh,
no,
first of all,

491
00:29:23.131 --> 00:29:26.610
a million and then 2 million then to me,
$5 million,
three picture deal.

492
00:29:26.611 --> 00:29:29.820
I'm going to read,
you know,
I can't believe this happened is that one question,

493
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:32.670
can you act?
And he said,
hey,
I'm making believe I'm having fun with you.

494
00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:35.700
And I get out.
I went,
hey man,
I was only kid and that was,

495
00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.290
that was a pretty good get out.
And I,
and I,
I just cost myself fine,

496
00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:42.130
we'll get the homeless but just by being funny and,

497
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.530
<v 0>and it,
and I said I'll never do that again.
So</v>

498
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.810
like that's going to happen.
Man.
Joke gets better.

499
00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:53.470
I read for this movie true romance,
you know.
Oh yeah.

500
00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.390
So I mean I get,
I get clean,
I get straight,
I work on the lines,
I'm ready.

501
00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:02.860
So I go over and it's Ridley Scott or his brother wanted a famous scot directors

502
00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.960
and a kid comes out.
I saw how many people in it,

503
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.540
it's 13 cause I was like to know how many even the room,

504
00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:11.770
cause you don't want to go into it.
So I walk in and uh,
and I look at the paper.

505
00:30:11.771 --> 00:30:13.960
He goes,
you ready?
I go,
yeah.
I told a script on the floor.
He goes,

506
00:30:13.961 --> 00:30:16.870
I guess you already said it.
The Times just hitting from the left.

507
00:30:16.871 --> 00:30:17.920
I was hitting frightened.
I said,

508
00:30:17.921 --> 00:30:20.290
you better like it cause you're never going to lick pussy again.
He goes,
Whoa,

509
00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.780
Whoa,
whoa.
What does it say?
Look Pussy.
I said,

510
00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:26.290
right in the script he picks up as it says,
the light pussy.
I said,
Oh,

511
00:30:26.291 --> 00:30:29.400
if you like it,
you look it right.
We want to know what breaks out of here.

512
00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:32.550
Get Out,
get out of my office saying,
well,
but that was when,
again,

513
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.820
so I'm driving home and my agent calls me and says,
what did you do to relax?

514
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.290
He said,
you're a brie inactive,
but you've got to get off the drugs.
They said,

515
00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:44.290
I haven't done coke in two weeks.
I was serious for this pot.

516
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:47.020
Who is he getting it to?
Tom Sizemore liquids.

517
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:52.790
There's no justice.
That's hilarious guys who were like,
Oh yeah,

518
00:30:52.791 --> 00:30:57.490
up to the neck and cocaine.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh my God,

519
00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.820
that's crazy that they get that upset.
I'm having fun.

520
00:30:59.821 --> 00:31:02.800
I'm pretending I'm how I make them believe I'm having fun with you on it.

521
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.330
Just because I thought we were pals half day that given your awkward,

522
00:31:07.331 --> 00:31:10.450
your millions of dollars and they go,
oh,
isn't this nice?
You know,

523
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:13.210
that's a problem with people that have so much power.

524
00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:17.290
They want you to suck their Dick every second of the day and as soon as there's

525
00:31:17.291 --> 00:31:20.710
any deviation at all,
they think you're,
oh,
you think you're a smart ass.

526
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.510
You're done in this town.
You don't have a lot of power.

527
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.500
You know how guys sleep with women,
you know,
to get hit.

528
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:31.180
I had a woman told me she wanted to fuck me,
but she was hideous.

529
00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:35.140
It was ignite in them on it.
You know what?
I'm going to Jesus.
I'm not even drunk

530
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.520
trying to back out of it.
Go,
no,
no.

531
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:45.480
I didn't get that job either.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
I mean,
look,

532
00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.120
there was casting couches for both sides.
There was,

533
00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.780
I knew a lady who bang all these like sad little actor guys.
She was always,

534
00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.620
she was the casting lady and she'd have these little sad actor guards.

535
00:31:55.621 --> 00:31:58.630
They're all like,
look,
all squeamish and shit.
And you're like,
oh,
look at her.

536
00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.460
She's got that guy on a rope too.

537
00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.390
And she would bang them all to get these guys party and shit.
Fuck them on.

538
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:09.390
But she was,
she was aggressive,
but I'm going to add,

539
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:14.190
it's creeping me out.
Not because I,
I did,
it's not what I want.

540
00:32:14.191 --> 00:32:17.190
The thing is though,
there's no victim there.
No.

541
00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.410
Nobody feels sorry for those guys at all.
Not even for a second.

542
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:23.530
A guy that fucks a lady who was a casting director like,
hey,

543
00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:26.410
he decided to do what he wanted to do.
I was like,

544
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:30.820
it's such a different thing than a guy being a casting agent that fucks the

545
00:32:30.821 --> 00:32:35.660
actress.
I would fuck a dry cleaner for free dry cleaning.
I'm not,

546
00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.260
you know,
it's just a matter of about what,
what do you want to do?

547
00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:43.280
You know how to that not bad at all.
Yeah,
it's a different animal.
It's funny.

548
00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:47.990
Yeah.
But that whole model is out the window now with all this me too stuff.

549
00:32:47.991 --> 00:32:52.080
And after Weinstein got shot down,
I don't act,
I've retired from acting side.

550
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:55.580
I'd like to see what it's like now and wonder how much different it is,

551
00:32:55.610 --> 00:33:00.110
how much it's changed.
You know,
I've been,
it's changed quite a bit recently,
Joe,

552
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.870
I gave Luhya shot at the club,
you know,

553
00:33:02.871 --> 00:33:07.070
after his heard about that and you know,
Louis called me up and said,
hey,

554
00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:10.940
do you mind if I do a spot?
And I thought about it.
I said,
yeah,
sure,
no problem.

555
00:33:10.941 --> 00:33:11.091
You know,

556
00:33:11.091 --> 00:33:16.091
I like Louis wasn't arrested or convicted of anything and so I put him in,

557
00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:20.340
he did fantastic and Cosby's what do you think I should?
Yeah.
And Ma,

558
00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:24.870
after that evening,
the backlash was just unbelievable.
Yeah.

559
00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:26.950
Just I go,
how long has it up?

560
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.870
What does this guy have to do to try to get his career back then?
Right.

561
00:33:29.871 --> 00:33:32.840
But what is the backlash though?
Because the backlash is not your,

562
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:37.280
your actual customers,
right.
It was,

563
00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:41.960
they grabbed some female comics slot work and that I'm working for me and it's

564
00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:47.020
said that Mike lock the doors and put a sexual Predator on stage and it was like

565
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.100
everyone there enjoyed Louis and you know,
I'm just trying to help a friend.

566
00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:57.110
He came in and he walked over to me.
I give him a big hug age.
We got no problem.

567
00:33:57.111 --> 00:34:00.890
I got no,
you knit what?
I said I would have called you if that prick.
Right.

568
00:34:00.891 --> 00:34:04.610
He'd give me a number.
He didn't give me an,
he goes,
that's not right,
and I go,

569
00:34:04.611 --> 00:34:07.350
I know.
That's what I told him.
I said,
should I bring him on stage?

570
00:34:07.351 --> 00:34:09.610
She's led you gentleman,
you know this me too thing and everything.

571
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:13.760
Here's a guy who,
who didn't touch any women,
not in fact,
he touched himself.

572
00:34:13.761 --> 00:34:16.370
That was the problem.
They just happened to be in a room and I said,

573
00:34:16.371 --> 00:34:18.620
you could have jerked off in front of me as long as you didn't get on my shirt,

574
00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.240
my shirt.
That's pretty expensive.
I said,
but these,

575
00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:24.920
you gave a job to the people that turned on him.

576
00:34:24.921 --> 00:34:28.670
He gave jobs to and yeah,
there's not,
right.
Well,

577
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.190
there's a lot to that story.
I don't know.

578
00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:35.540
There's a lot to that story that would make him look very different in a lot of

579
00:34:35.541 --> 00:34:38.890
these people that are accusing him.
And one day I think he's going to tell us.

580
00:34:38.891 --> 00:34:40.800
So he,
I had a conversation with him about it.
It's,

581
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:43.340
it's not as cut and dry as everybody thinks.

582
00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:46.790
Everybody thinks he had power over these women and he pulled his dick out and

583
00:34:46.791 --> 00:34:48.100
start.
No,
there was a lot of,

584
00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.410
there was a lot of sex talk and it was a lot of flirting.

585
00:34:51.411 --> 00:34:55.830
There was a lot going on.
It wasn't that simple.
And he's very calm.

586
00:34:56.300 --> 00:35:00.530
He's very contrite about it.
This very,
very,
and he knows he fucked up.

587
00:35:00.531 --> 00:35:03.830
And by the way,
he hadn't done anything like that.
And more than a decade.

588
00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:07.790
It was a long time.
He just,
he's,
yeah,
he's got a kinky thing.

589
00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:13.150
Said I can't,
I can't even,
I can't read chuck off.
If the name is a home,

590
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:18.110
I'm a wreck.
I make weird faces yelling.
Joe wouldn't be fun for anyone.
I bad guy.

591
00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:22.640
He's a good guy,
no rapist.
He's a sexual predator.
That Jenny Buddy,

592
00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.750
he caught the worst part of the wave you.
Oh yeah.

593
00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:29.240
You know like if you're in the ocean and you could be in the ocean on a,

594
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:32.390
on a fucking surf board and you just catch this little tiny wave and

595
00:35:32.391 --> 00:35:36.500
everything's fine or you could fuck up and be in the right spot when that giant

596
00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:37.980
wave comes and slams you

597
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.520
<v 1>in the head and you have the same intention and the same person and other and</v>

598
00:35:41.521 --> 00:35:44.150
other times in history,
he would have been fine.
He might,

599
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.540
he would probably be fine today because everything,
everything's kind of,

600
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:51.240
there's enough of the females that have come out that have been full of shit

601
00:35:51.241 --> 00:35:55.380
like Asia Argento and the girl accused Chris Hardwick and then Chris Hardwick

602
00:35:55.381 --> 00:35:58.740
released all these text messages that showed that she actually cheated on him

603
00:35:58.741 --> 00:36:02.190
and she brought him back and she's just trying to punish him for all this.

604
00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:06.410
But these,
there's a few of those situations now where people realize,
well,

605
00:36:06.411 --> 00:36:10.190
well there's,
there's definitely sexual predators and is definitely bad men and,

606
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:15.230
but there's also women are taken advantage of this movement and I think the

607
00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:17.760
world is sort of like calm down a little.

608
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:21.540
Like the Asia Argento thought one was a big one.
You know when she,

609
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:25.500
it turned out that she was calling Harvey Weinstein a rapist while she was

610
00:36:25.501 --> 00:36:28.110
fucking a 17 year old.
Right.
But she was,

611
00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.860
she played his mom in a movie 10 years ago when he was seven.

612
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:34.290
It's like Jesus Christ.
Like how could you,

613
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:37.980
how could you have that kind of hypocrisy?
But there's a lot of that in,

614
00:36:37.981 --> 00:36:42.330
in people that are screaming for attention at the front of the line of a lot of

615
00:36:42.331 --> 00:36:45.990
these things.
A lot of them have like dark secrets themselves.
Yeah.
You know,

616
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.510
and like these people that don't want a guy like Louis to have a road

617
00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:53.820
redemption,
they don't want them to work.
Or even a guy like Aziz Ansari,

618
00:36:53.821 --> 00:36:58.050
which is even worse,
he had a bad date with a girl,
right?
Like a bad date.

619
00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:01.650
Where she blew him like three different times and didn't want to keep going.

620
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.190
Well,
wait,
he can't push shit bad date.
That sounds pretty good to me.

621
00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.570
It's pretty good.
No,
I,
it's better than no.
Yeah,
but it's,

622
00:37:09.571 --> 00:37:13.210
the whole thing was so crazy.
It's like
there's,

623
00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:16.080
there's more than one side to every story like that.

624
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:21.230
And to take someone's opinion or someone's perception of something as 100% the

625
00:37:21.661 --> 00:37:26.160
actual event that happened without any other evidence.
It's kind of crazy.

626
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.620
I mean,
I don't think,
I just,

627
00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:33.330
I just think people have to recognize that Louis in particular,

628
00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.390
he's been out of work.
He was out of work for 10 months.

629
00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:39.870
He lost all of his shows last time was people think he didn't suffer from that

630
00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.560
$30 million to people that think he didn't suffer a crazy,

631
00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:46.560
you're crazy if you think you should never be allowed to work again.
Well,

632
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.460
he's not a criminal.
Right?
He's not in jail.
Right,
right.
So what are you saying?

633
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.240
Like he shouldn't be able to do stand up.
Everyone deserves this.

634
00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:57.510
And that was my point.
Yeah.
I said,
sure.
Louis come in.
You know what?
Yeah,

635
00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.600
I want it to give him a fighting chance.
And He,

636
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:03.330
I guess he is back doing clubs now and he's doing a lot of clubs and uh,

637
00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:05.550
he was very,
that's it.
It's always trying to do,

638
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.040
she's just trying to get his life back.
You know,

639
00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:12.390
he's built in his act again doing clubs and some fucking asshole releases his

640
00:38:12.391 --> 00:38:15.660
whole act on Youtube.
So now all that material has to chuck away.

641
00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.990
So he was writing during the time he was gone,
but not performing.

642
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:23.370
And then he puts together,
you know,
an act that,
you know,
look,
you know,

643
00:38:23.371 --> 00:38:25.470
as well as anybody when you have new shit,

644
00:38:25.471 --> 00:38:28.380
it's got some goddamn holes in it right when it comes up.

645
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:32.510
I'd never written a bit,
ever.
Maybe one or two in my whole career.
That was the,

646
00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:35.980
that was the finished bit when I first did it on stage.
Maybe one

647
00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:39.430
<v 2>or two ever.
They're always clunky and too,
and sometimes you have ideas.</v>

648
00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:41.230
You're like,
why the fuck don't even try that one.

649
00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.840
Like the Parkland shooter bit like w w we,

650
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.700
he was doing that bit right now it's in a very unfortunate bit.
Right.

651
00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:50.420
Especially when people aren't in the club here at and then,

652
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:54.820
but who knows what that bit would have been if you go with it and tape it.

653
00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.990
If you gave him a year to work it out.
Right.

654
00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:01.210
He probably would have figured out a way to make it where it wasn't offensive

655
00:39:01.211 --> 00:39:03.430
and it didn't shit on those kids in the same way.

656
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:08.200
My best stuff was when she has to go before cell phones and before because I

657
00:39:08.201 --> 00:39:11.830
didn't know,
I just,
I just went up to,
and now what I'm onstage,

658
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:15.150
I'm constantly thinking,
oh don't go that.
Don't do that.

659
00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.560
Don't cross that line because some,
you know,

660
00:39:17.561 --> 00:39:20.540
and that's a terrible feeling for it.
Oh it's horrible.
It's hard.

661
00:39:20.541 --> 00:39:24.910
If the funny shit that you and I have laughed out hard was something that

662
00:39:24.911 --> 00:39:27.010
someone definitely shouldn't have said.
Oh absolutely.

663
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.440
They knew they shouldn't have said it.
That's why they were saying it.

664
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:32.050
There were saying it to make the audience laugh cause they were like,

665
00:39:32.051 --> 00:39:33.700
I can't believe you fucking said that.
Yeah.

666
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.520
Not like he means like that's his actual thoughts.

667
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:38.770
There's no maliciousness behind the dye of,
no.

668
00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:42.730
You think I want people to spend 30 40 bucks to go out and that'd be pissed him

669
00:39:42.731 --> 00:39:45.650
off and ruin your night with your wife for a date.
No.

670
00:39:45.651 --> 00:39:49.390
And he end up just trying to make you laugh.
So now it's like,
you know,

671
00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:54.410
it's just so Joe,
I can't remember back with you and Mike McCarthy.
Yeah,

672
00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.440
that was like who could work the dirtiest?

673
00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.910
You guys would be in the back just dying.
Yeah,

674
00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.070
there were nice big Kenny would get heights.

675
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:10.390
Let's see if we can walk the room and I've seen people suck and have a row,

676
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.810
but I mean women that w we'd love that.
Oh my God.

677
00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:16.500
I remember one night I was feeling great and I said that let me do.

678
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:21.160
And I was getting fucked up and I turned on the crowd and then I felt bad

679
00:40:21.161 --> 00:40:22.890
because they will show upset.

680
00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:25.870
So discussed with him and these are like regulars usually come.

681
00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:28.730
I started trying to win him back with a bag of,

682
00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:33.120
took me an hour and a half to get them back,
but there was nothing I did.

683
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.890
I show it all ends or whatever.
Said Guy heckle him and I said,
listen,

684
00:40:35.891 --> 00:40:36.521
if you don't shut up,

685
00:40:36.521 --> 00:40:40.360
I'm going to come down and hit puppy right in the fucking face.
And I did.

686
00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:43.860
I went and went up to stage at up this fucking guy waiting.

687
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:47.880
He was bleeding and the crowd was on his shot.

688
00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:50.440
Hey,
attacking us.

689
00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:55.060
And it took me 45 minutes just to break even,

690
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:58.210
you know?
And then you kept going after you punched the guy in the face.

691
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.570
That's amazing in and of itself.

692
00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.810
God Alando I don't know what I know it was in Atlanta,
it was w w you know,

693
00:41:07.811 --> 00:41:10.420
I'd be stealing a bunch of one night isn't it?
With and I was,

694
00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.370
because the crowd was a big crowd,
but it's been like 300 people.
No,

695
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:17.590
I love Beethoven and this guy just,
and I fucking hate it.
And I would write a,

696
00:41:17.591 --> 00:41:20.530
put the mic down,
Bang went off and he went down.

697
00:41:20.531 --> 00:41:23.620
He was screaming and crying like,
wow.
And I went up in a bipolar.

698
00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:26.290
That's the difference in Boston and Orlando.

699
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:34.100
Yeah,
it can't do,
you gave me the best

700
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.110
<v 1>advice anybody ever gave me when I was starting out.</v>

701
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.820
You did right and right after your brother gave me the worst,
right?

702
00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:43.460
<v 2>True.
Mike told me to work.
Well it was,
it was good advice at the time.</v>

703
00:41:43.461 --> 00:41:46.770
It was smart.
It's just you.
I just said,
Joe May,

704
00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:49.210
I think maybe you should try to clean it up a bit and you know,

705
00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:52.730
and let he comes home and says fuck him.
He goes,

706
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:56.580
don't let you to have you a great kid.
I love you.
Don't change it thing.
Yeah,

707
00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.720
you bumped me up,
man.
Well,
you know what that thing was,
you made me laugh.

708
00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:03.650
You cause I mean,
I've seen everybody.
I didn't want when I started doing comedy,

709
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:07.910
but 41 years ago,
there was only a hundred comedians,
maybe the whole country.

710
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.640
You don't know what I,
if I heard of someone,

711
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:15.790
I would fly to their town to go onstage and said,
let's get on Kennison.
You know,

712
00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:19.880
and uh,
you know,
Bill Slayton in San Francisco,
you know,

713
00:42:19.881 --> 00:42:24.530
people that dump in Philadelphia,
people I thought were really good in that.

714
00:42:24.531 --> 00:42:27.500
It might,
you know,
I would like to see what it is,
you know,

715
00:42:27.501 --> 00:42:30.170
and then became friends with all of them,
you know?
That's awesome.
And then,

716
00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.090
then it just blew up.
I mean,
you know,

717
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.530
now you don't even have to have an accurate on youtube or

718
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:35.661
<v 1>yeah,</v>

719
00:42:35.661 --> 00:42:38.330
you still have to have an act when you get in front of those live audiences.

720
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.600
Thanks.
So,
yeah,
I've seen it.
I've seen those youtube guys each shit

721
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:48.260
to draw people out to the club and I for a while,

722
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.180
they'll do it for what you trick people for a little bit,

723
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:53.900
unless they become good.
I mean,
they keep putting in the work and do the act.

724
00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:56.660
I mean,
and,
and,
and,
you know,
develop an act,

725
00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:00.680
but you either can do it or you don't.
Like Jerry Seinfeld once said,

726
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:05.750
very famously that if you're famous,
you have it buys you 30 seconds,

727
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.020
30 seconds in front of a crowd,
they're happy,
you're there,

728
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:13.730
they'll give you 30 seconds and after that like,
okay,
where's the jokes?
Three.

729
00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.170
Hey,
he's a fucking good joke writer.
Yeah.
Yeah,

730
00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.830
he's still cops smeared off,
still slinging it.

731
00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:24.230
He says comedy store every now and again.

732
00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:27.620
I think he's still in Branson and he has a theater and branch but it comes down

733
00:43:27.621 --> 00:43:32.330
to the store and I worked with him a couple of times.
He's good.
He writes,

734
00:43:32.331 --> 00:43:36.440
he's got new material.
He looks good too.
He's healthy and thin.
Yeah.
Yeah.

735
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:41.180
But um,
like if those youtube guys,
they have a,

736
00:43:41.181 --> 00:43:43.280
they have a shortcut.
Right.
You know there's there,

737
00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:46.130
they make funny videos on Youtube,
but yeah,
they,

738
00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:49.040
they'll get a crowd even though they're not really funny.

739
00:43:49.041 --> 00:43:53.090
But if they put in the work they can pull it off like it has been done.

740
00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.510
The most courageous guy I ever saw was Charlie Murphy.
Yup.

741
00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:00.170
Cause Charlie Murphy was essentially a famous open miker.
Right.

742
00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:03.320
And that fucking guy would,
he started out hosting.

743
00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.200
It would be him and dawn now and bill burr.

744
00:44:06.201 --> 00:44:09.410
And they would do these shows together.
And Charlie had never done standup,

745
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.960
but he had the most famous brother ever.

746
00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.320
I mean his brother was fucking all Eddie Murphy.
Yeah.

747
00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:17.300
And people saw him on the Chappelle Chappelle show.
Really loved him.

748
00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:22.970
So he became famous and then the guy had balls of fucking steel man.

749
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:28.210
I did a 22 show tour with him and he had only been doing comedy for two years.

750
00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:33.900
Yeah.
And I had been doing comedy for than 20 and we were co headlining.

751
00:44:33.901 --> 00:44:37.690
So I would headline one night,
he would headline the other night.
And uh,

752
00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:42.810
I mean to be able to go on after a guy has been doing comedy 24 years or

753
00:44:42.961 --> 00:44:47.961
whatever the fuck it was and go on after him and do 40 minutes when you've only

754
00:44:48.211 --> 00:44:49.230
been doing yeah.

755
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:54.480
And just the balls that got hat and he would just go on out there like he owned

756
00:44:54.481 --> 00:44:58.660
the place.
Yeah.
But passed away,
right.
Chase passed away.

757
00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.090
<v 2>Yeah.
Bought a little over a year ago.</v>

758
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:06.560
I think all the people that we work with them,
that they're not here anymore.

759
00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.040
A lot of them,
I'm gone.
My good God set the ones that suck.

760
00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.880
I still there fucking,
hey,
I worked.
You know,

761
00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:18.950
you always make it a point at paypal standard material.

762
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:23.150
One of the biggest states that Evelyn was,
Ali Jo Predo.
I never met him.

763
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:27.290
He was this big breath,
big fat redneck guy and what?

764
00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:31.370
Working down south someplace,
maybe Florida and we're in the green room.

765
00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:36.170
Any watch the tonight show and it's on and we're doing the late show and Carson

766
00:45:36.171 --> 00:45:39.550
comes up,
does his monologue and after is my eyelid ship.
All of Joe Painter.

767
00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:44.480
He went out and did,
gosh,
it's a monologue.
This standing ovation.

768
00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:48.710
I've got no one to 11 no,
there was no VCRs back then.
There were no tapes.

769
00:45:48.711 --> 00:45:52.370
They would not that I got,
he's still one of my,
and you stole my joke.
Yeah,

770
00:45:52.371 --> 00:45:56.990
but I do it better.
I got no,
you don't add a it's way to it,
man.

771
00:45:56.991 --> 00:46:01.080
It's off.
Yeah,
but I do it better.
That's what he said.
He's young kids,
young men.

772
00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:01.943
But I do it better.

773
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:04.590
<v 1>Well,
you know,
back in the day,
in the Catskills times,</v>

774
00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:09.060
they all stole like there was due,
no honor amongst thieves back then.

775
00:46:09.061 --> 00:46:12.390
And everyone just had jokes.
They were just joke jokes.

776
00:46:12.391 --> 00:46:15.180
Like he almost had like a toolbox.
Like oh I needed three eighths.

777
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:21.570
And then as television came along and then people started getting in trouble for

778
00:46:21.571 --> 00:46:22.440
stealing,
you know,

779
00:46:22.441 --> 00:46:26.490
Robin got in trouble and a few other guys got in trouble and then it sort of

780
00:46:26.491 --> 00:46:28.260
died off until like,

781
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.830
I mean when youtube came along then it kind of killed it.

782
00:46:31.831 --> 00:46:35.820
There's still a few thieves that are still running around to this day and some

783
00:46:35.821 --> 00:46:40.140
of them are famous,
but most of the audience knows now.

784
00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:42.750
And if you like look at someone who's a thief and then you look at their

785
00:46:42.751 --> 00:46:44.370
Instagram comments like,
Holy Shit,

786
00:46:44.371 --> 00:46:46.830
people go after them and people know now they know.

787
00:46:46.831 --> 00:46:50.730
It's the darkest thing you can do when a guy works or girl works forever on a

788
00:46:50.731 --> 00:46:53.130
bit.
And then you just come along at the finished product,

789
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:56.610
snatch it and switch a couple words around and pretend,

790
00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.290
pretend you came up with it on your own.

791
00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:03.020
<v 2>When I started,
I was working as a janitor in city hall at Cambridge and I took,</v>

792
00:47:03.021 --> 00:47:05.960
the other is up for bs when we went to the spring fest digital and we saw

793
00:47:05.961 --> 00:47:09.770
Sweeney and we saw Sweeney and Bill Campbell and I'm going,
oh my God.

794
00:47:09.771 --> 00:47:13.310
Sweeney was just,
it was like,
wow,
this guy,
I've never seen anything like it.

795
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:18.200
And a couple of guys,
a couple of other comics when on my,
the Janice said,
yeah,

796
00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.520
funny at and these guys you should do it.

797
00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:23.750
So I talked to George McDonald about it at school the next day and he goes,

798
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:26.390
yeah man,
you should be a comedian.
I go,
what's that?
He goes,

799
00:47:26.391 --> 00:47:28.910
that's what you saw last night.
So his,

800
00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:32.020
and we listen to woody Allen album and I didn't even know,

801
00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:33.580
I didn't know Woody Allen from Smith.

802
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:37.450
I had know he was a comedian and he did that joke about hitting a moose up in

803
00:47:37.451 --> 00:47:40.720
Maine.
So I would on,
and I've been onstage before to when I'm at the,

804
00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:44.740
but the thing I was spring frustrates alone and I did this and it was

805
00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:48.520
unbelievable.
It changed.
It was thunderous applause.
Like a stair that automation.

806
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.790
And afterwards this little guy comes into backwards.
Mr Clock,
you're very funny.

807
00:47:51.791 --> 00:47:55.170
But you shouldn't use woody Allen material.
What do you fuck?
You can audio.

808
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:59.860
Oh man,
the chick.
And that was it.
That was it.
I suck for months.
I said,

809
00:47:59.861 --> 00:48:03.850
but it was all mine.
It was crazy.
Yeah.
There's a lot of guys in the beginning.

810
00:48:03.851 --> 00:48:06.160
That's Greg Fitzsimmons and I used to steal from each other.

811
00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:09.130
We had a deal though,
if he was on it,

812
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:12.910
cause we both only had like 15 minutes and we had to do a half right.

813
00:48:12.911 --> 00:48:16.660
So I would steal 15 of his,
he'd still 15 a mine and we were best friends.

814
00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.950
Oh yeah.
So we'd go there.
He'd go,
oh dude,

815
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.730
that blowjob material killed and fucking Pawtucket.

816
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.800
I said to Kenny,
I said,
Kenny,
that that was fucking patio sets yours.

817
00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.380
You fucking morning.
That's where we show.
Cause I had never,

818
00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:33.510
I didn't know what I was doing.
I can't remember his,
I can't remember.

819
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:37.170
You know what I mean?
I just see all the best guys ideas.

820
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:40.270
You gotta be waiting for Joey off stage with a notebook and you gotta go.

821
00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:44.770
Say that again.
You had a who used to do that?
Uh,

822
00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:49.020
Mike Donovan.
Mike because Mike Donovan,

823
00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:53.380
I saw him like wow,
this guy.
So just braid real technical about everything.

824
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:58.330
And I used to take them out after shows and taking the breakfast and he tell me,

825
00:48:58.331 --> 00:48:58.811
he says,
listen,

826
00:48:58.811 --> 00:49:01.810
I'm going to tell you everything you did wrong there no need for me to tell you

827
00:49:01.811 --> 00:49:04.390
what you did right.
Cause you can tell but everything you did wrong.

828
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:06.340
And he would listen to him and go,
oh my God.

829
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:11.000
And he helped mold me and he helped make me technically a better [inaudible].

830
00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:14.020
I owe him a lot.
It,
Mike Dunn was great.
He helped me as well.

831
00:49:14.021 --> 00:49:17.930
He told me to record all my sets and told me to get the till tapes did this day

832
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:20.600
Joe,
he was like,
you never know.

833
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.290
You might say one thing and you forget you say it,

834
00:49:23.291 --> 00:49:26.330
but that one thing might be to make the bit 10 times better Gel.

835
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.420
I listened to him and I taped everything.

836
00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:32.780
There's boxes of shit never last one about,

837
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:37.190
but I was reading the Lenny Bruce thing and he used to tape,
you know,

838
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:40.030
and so I didn't realize he was taping the Jack.

839
00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:44.700
I thought he was taping talking to to them.
So you know,

840
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:49.030
hey man.
So I would write,
when I first started doing it,

841
00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:52.090
I would write for hours and I would go down to kitchens.
Hey Ma,

842
00:49:52.091 --> 00:49:54.730
what do you think it is?
And I tell her check,
she goes,
I don't know,

843
00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:59.620
I guess it's good.
Let me,
I'm like,
she said,
well I really liked that rip tail.

844
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:04.350
Like a rep deloach
by all the shit right now I rep,

845
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:07.900
she goes,
that's why Heinz 57 variety,
just get over it.
You know,

846
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:11.050
I'm the only funny person in the world,
right?
So late.
Oh yeah,
she was,

847
00:50:11.051 --> 00:50:15.010
she didn't take any shit.
So I'm working at the dunes,
what they and Pauly shore.

848
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:18.610
I'm up by the pool.
And polishes.
Hey Lady,
I took around who is,
he would rip tail,

849
00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:22.930
right?
So,
Ooh,
look at that one.
And he's,
he's,

850
00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:28.130
he's killing me.
And I said,
I said,
Mr [inaudible] was a copy Brit was,
oh yeah.

851
00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:32.390
<v 0>I said,
awesome.
I said,
would you just talk to my mother?</v>

852
00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:36.920
So they bring a phone out to the pool and uh,
Hello Jean.

853
00:50:36.921 --> 00:50:38.230
It's rip Taylor and you hear it.

854
00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:43.610
He's so nice to her,
right.
And then he gives me a function.

855
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:48.860
I told you he was funny.
Idiot.
I pray.

856
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:52.310
I ended up doing Hollywood squares.
We've got to be friends with a good guy.

857
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:57.230
Good guy.
That he made me laugh like,
oh,
he was funny.
He was a hilarious guy.

858
00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.690
He was a,
the Hollywood squares me.
He took over that show.

859
00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:04.080
If you saw Hollywood squares and rip Taylor wasn't on,
you're like,
what is rep?

860
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:08.170
I know.
He's the funny one.
He's the guy you want to hear talk yet.

861
00:51:08.171 --> 00:51:11.330
Donovan told me to record all my sets and he,
you know,
he would,

862
00:51:11.331 --> 00:51:14.930
who explained to you the fuck meter to Oh,
oh,

863
00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.930
that was something that young comics to this day don't understand.

864
00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:21.300
First time I ever heard that,
he goes,
well,
you broke the fuck made or I go,
what?

865
00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.700
And I didn't even realize I was doing it.

866
00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:27.380
And now what I'm working with guys that I liked that he got,
I said,

867
00:51:27.381 --> 00:51:30.410
you don't listen.
You don't need the fuck.
They dropped the fuck that you don't,

868
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:34.460
you don't need that.
That jokes fine without it.
You know?
And I mean,
well,

869
00:51:34.461 --> 00:51:36.040
you and I go,
don't,
don't do what I do,

870
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:40.610
but you can do it when it's necessary.
When it's necessary,

871
00:51:40.611 --> 00:51:44.810
it'll mean more if you don't have 10 other unusual,
well unnecessarily with Mike,

872
00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:45.590
you know,
he,

873
00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:50.590
he tends to use it where he wants to use it and he worries about the guys on,

874
00:51:50.691 --> 00:51:51.980
in front of him,
you know,
he goes,

875
00:51:51.981 --> 00:51:56.120
I don't want you doing it just for the sake of doing it,
you know?
And he was,

876
00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:59.990
you know,
he's,
Mike's a great guy and he's still tapes every show.
Well,

877
00:51:59.991 --> 00:52:03.080
he's a great comic and he's just very aware that you can,

878
00:52:03.081 --> 00:52:06.040
the audience get numb to that word doesn't mean anything,
right.

879
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:09.830
You don't hear it until he goes up.
And then when he goes up,

880
00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.540
you only hear it when it's necessary.
It makes it,

881
00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:15.680
it's a presentation issue because if there's a guy in front of you,

882
00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:18.900
some comics will use the word fuck the same when they use the word.
Um,

883
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.890
they're like,
no,
I fucking like,
and guy with the fucking thing.

884
00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:26.600
He's got his fucking hat on and his fucking shoes are tied in this fucking,

885
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:30.890
and by the time you say,
and I'm like,
fuck you,
it doesn't mean anything.

886
00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.660
I used to open for Leno and he would say to me,
you know,
you're really funny,

887
00:52:35.661 --> 00:52:40.630
but you don't have to be that filter.
You don't have to.
I said,
yeah,
but I,

888
00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:43.940
but I feel like I'm selling out.
Yes,
you're not selling,
you're cashing in.

889
00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.850
And My mother always just said,
you can get more work.

890
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:50.100
And then started doing corporate cakes.
And people said,
listen,
Lenny,

891
00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:51.650
we don't care if you're mildly amusing,

892
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:54.860
as long as you don't say fuck or anything.
I yeah.

893
00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:59.870
And my flight pay 20,
30 grand and you sign some autographs.
Yah.

894
00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:04.550
So I mean,
so you did sell.
Ah,
yeah.
Those are,
those are tempting.

895
00:53:04.551 --> 00:53:08.640
That's the siren song.
Those was corporate gigs.
Yeah.
Cause I remember,
uh,

896
00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:12.650
like that's like,
that's where Jay made most of his money.
Oh yeah.

897
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.710
I mean he would make hundreds of thousands of dollars.
So he needs it.

898
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:21.350
Well then someone says,
you know,
he uh,
he never spent any money.

899
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:25.430
All of his money went to cars and all that money came from gigs.
Yeah.

900
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:26.670
And he never put out a special,

901
00:53:26.671 --> 00:53:31.470
he had one special on showtime way back in the day in Philly.
Yeah,
that's right.

902
00:53:31.471 --> 00:53:33.930
I remember that.
That was what,
it was good.
It was a good special.

903
00:53:33.931 --> 00:53:36.630
And I talked to him about it.
He goes,
Hey,
wait,
why would I do that?
He goes,

904
00:53:36.631 --> 00:53:40.440
I put on my act,
he goes,
give me just give me $1 million.
He goes,

905
00:53:40.441 --> 00:53:41.340
that's going to cost me money.

906
00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:45.330
But his whole thing was he didn't want to do it because that material was gone

907
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:46.930
once he did it right,

908
00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:51.810
but he would go to these places and do the same act like two years later and

909
00:53:51.820 --> 00:53:54.800
people be like,
what the fuck?
But he just had this polished.

910
00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:58.560
But all people had said to me,
hey man,
I really don't care for him.
I said,

911
00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:00.390
well what do you,
I said,
listen me,
I said,

912
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:03.750
I used to open from and one that I was at Nick's and I was,

913
00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.380
I supposed to do 20 minutes and whatever.
I was hoping for something,

914
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:10.880
I do my time and get off.
That's just respect.
And he come in and he goes,
well,

915
00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:13.700
I said,
okay.
So at the end anyway,

916
00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:17.490
so now I do about 45 and I stayed there,

917
00:54:17.491 --> 00:54:20.850
all crowds going crazy and I'm walking off in my mind that I'm going to follow

918
00:54:20.851 --> 00:54:24.700
that fucker.
You know what I mean?
He gets on stage but two minutes it was like,

919
00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:26.370
let me who he was that good.

920
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:31.590
He was amazing.
Don't know.
I don't know.

921
00:54:31.591 --> 00:54:35.970
Cause when he used to go on Letterman back when he was young,
crazy,
dark hair,

922
00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:41.370
he was the edgy calm,
which is hard for young guys to Joe.
He had,

923
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:45.010
he would do a two hour show and it wasn't too much.
Right.

924
00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:47.610
Know it was killer.
Yeah.
Yeah.

925
00:54:47.611 --> 00:54:51.120
He's extremely underrated as a,
as a contractor.

926
00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:54.450
And I think it's unfortunate that he doesn't have like a great body of work

927
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:58.320
other than tonight show monologues and people think of him as the guy with

928
00:54:58.321 --> 00:54:59.011
tonight show model.

929
00:54:59.011 --> 00:55:03.820
He's a great standup and anyone that,

930
00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:09.330
that I see that is really through,
I give it up.
You know,
it's,
it is the thing,

931
00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:13.250
you make me laugh.
You know,
I like if you,
if you had successful and it's,

932
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:16.830
I'm not getting,
I'm gum there,
you know,
that's good for you.
You know?
I mean,

933
00:55:16.831 --> 00:55:21.000
I don't belittle anybody for the success in the same way,
you know,
but,

934
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:24.320
but if you make me laugh,
then I,
I'll pay,
I'll pay to go see it.

935
00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:25.170
If you don't make me laugh,

936
00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:27.960
it's a waste of time to worry about something you don't like because obviously

937
00:55:27.961 --> 00:55:30.450
other people like it.
What do you give a shit?
Yeah,

938
00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:33.110
I feel the same way about music,
which I don't,

939
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:36.150
there's a lot of music I don't like.
It's they sold millions of albums.

940
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:41.010
I don't care.
Yeah,
there's no room.
I just want to,

941
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:43.230
I just want to laugh if he can make me laugh.

942
00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:47.100
That's why some of the people I hang around with just skill and we'd go out,

943
00:55:47.101 --> 00:55:51.120
we go out to dinner,
everyone puts his cell,
phone's on the table off.
Beautiful.

944
00:55:51.121 --> 00:55:54.640
You know,
cause it's been a nice,
yeah,
we can't be,

945
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:57.780
all you need is something that would take you down,
you know.
Oh God.

946
00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:01.290
So many people are fucking interested in just looking at their phone all time.

947
00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:04.170
Now,
if I wasn't as old as I am,

948
00:56:04.171 --> 00:56:08.460
if I was a young kid coming up now I'd be an animal cause I wouldn't care.

949
00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:11.220
And it,
oh you can't say that.
Oh,
let me tell you this right now.

950
00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:15.630
And the thing was,
you know,
when I started,
people would say,
oh my God,

951
00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:18.080
what a funny take on it.
And like,
well it's an oh funny tag.

952
00:56:18.081 --> 00:56:20.670
It was what I actually thought.
Right.
Rather than,
you know,

953
00:56:20.671 --> 00:56:24.750
popped up alone and that build on the old.
I just,
Oh yeah.
Cause I,

954
00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:27.820
that's why I've never thought it was funny to anybody.

955
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:33.280
I just know that I'm sick and I just use that as,

956
00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:37.990
as the under the guise a few miles.
It works.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Know it works well.

957
00:56:37.991 --> 00:56:41.380
We were very lucky that in those days in Boston,

958
00:56:41.381 --> 00:56:45.040
maybe I started in [inaudible] 88 but in,
in those days there was,

959
00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:50.380
I remember in in stream who had you had the comedy at the Charles River up the

960
00:56:50.381 --> 00:56:55.140
theater above downstairs was the connection right over here was nixed by and

961
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:58.890
over.
There was duck soup.
Right.
I was fucking crazy.
It was fine.
God,

962
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.010
he opened one club.
What was that club in the hotel?
Brad.

963
00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:06.600
What was in the basement?
Jokers.
Okay.
This place would hold over three hours,

964
00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.540
dutiful rule.
And One night I had Mike bind that.
C'Mon,

965
00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:12.010
you know Mike and Mike bind it.
I should do,

966
00:57:12.011 --> 00:57:14.230
she's done a documentary right now on the store.
I said,

967
00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:16.660
there's some time I'm in the back it backstage,

968
00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:19.470
don't Lij and he brought to the tie on it.

969
00:57:19.471 --> 00:57:22.960
It's a part of the page where the dress and the dress room years and this is the

970
00:57:22.961 --> 00:57:27.190
other comedians or how to work well.
The other comedians or mom up chop up

971
00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:34.960
Jesus Christ,
the DUPLO watch the edge of people got relax,
relax.

972
00:57:34.961 --> 00:57:39.670
It's just stunt coke.
It's not real,
you know?
So there's no other place like that.

973
00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:42.730
Like the scene in New York was very different.
The scene in New York,

974
00:57:42.731 --> 00:57:45.070
there's the net,
they'd never did the hosting thing.

975
00:57:45.071 --> 00:57:46.330
The way they did it in Boston,

976
00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.020
there wasn't as many clubs that were like close together.

977
00:57:49.021 --> 00:57:53.200
They would talk to the crowd.
There were no joke.
We from,

978
00:57:53.201 --> 00:57:57.220
and then there was,
it's a little different now.
Now there's a lot of jokes,

979
00:57:57.221 --> 00:58:01.870
but the,
I think I attribute that to the size of the rooms in New York.

980
00:58:01.871 --> 00:58:02.890
You're on top of people.

981
00:58:02.891 --> 00:58:05.440
That's the first thing I noticed when I moved to New York.
I was like,

982
00:58:05.441 --> 00:58:06.760
God fucking audiences.

983
00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:10.210
It's literally would be like I'd be standing on stage and you would be the front

984
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.810
row.

985
00:58:10.810 --> 00:58:15.710
Everyone's so close because there's no state catch a rising star Dangerfield

986
00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:21.190
there on standup,
New York state,
New York.
You're on top of you.
I used to go down,

987
00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:24.760
I take the train down and stand in line,
wait for number to go on at catch.

988
00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:28.720
And that put me on last cause I was from Boston and I go out when I burned it

989
00:58:28.721 --> 00:58:33.040
down and go,
hey man,
you know,
here's your $10 $10 I'd give it to the pot.

990
00:58:33.041 --> 00:58:36.910
Then I get onto the night owl and go back and I did that for years.

991
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:39.010
And finally some like bells.

992
00:58:39.011 --> 00:58:42.580
It was good to me and even Pisco gave me a break and some other guys.

993
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:46.270
But Mike said,
what are you going to nef which went through the window it here,

994
00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:50.720
let's,
why go to New York?
Let's have them come to us.
And w the thing,

995
00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:53.820
I was just like an explosion.
It was,

996
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:56.050
there was no place like that scene.

997
00:58:56.290 --> 00:59:00.550
And I feel so lucky that I started standup in [inaudible] 88 in Boston.

998
00:59:00.551 --> 00:59:03.100
I feel like I just caught this wave.
No.
Yeah,
it was,

999
00:59:03.101 --> 00:59:06.610
when did you leave Joe 91 I think,

1000
00:59:06.611 --> 00:59:10.750
or [inaudible] 92 to go to New York or La,
New York.
New York.

1001
00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:14.140
I got signed by Jeff Sossman.
Okay.
That's when I moved to New York.

1002
00:59:14.141 --> 00:59:17.200
Then that one he was driving limo.
Then when you went to la,

1003
00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:21.970
it was that the baseball show you got with hardware.
But Mike Stop.
Yeah.

1004
00:59:22.460 --> 00:59:25.690
<v 2>And the funny thing about Mike's.
Dot.
I always wanted to work with him.
I just,</v>

1005
00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:27.520
he's a great guy.
He is a great guy,

1006
00:59:27.521 --> 00:59:32.150
but yet he had a ton of incredible body of work.
So we do a movie together,

1007
00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:36.430
we to something,
but uh,
up in Canada and we get an a beef,

1008
00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:41.980
you and Mike Star.
Yeah,
I see.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's it.
So I said,

1009
00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.313
I don't know.

1010
00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:47.450
He said something that we were drinking and we were drinking like Labatt black

1011
00:59:47.451 --> 00:59:51.110
ice.
You got the hangover before you get high.
It was done.
Powerful shit.
Right.

1012
00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:56.360
And he,
he said something,
he goes,
hey man,
I waited 10 years to work with you.

1013
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:59.930
It depends on like a deck.
And he said something.
I leap over the table.

1014
01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:03.350
Fight broke out.
They had a bus?
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
I was,

1015
01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:07.930
I was on him like a spider monkey.
That was all so,
but I was,

1016
01:00:09.290 --> 01:00:13.580
I was like three 50 at the time.
So when I,
well I landed on him.
He went down,

1017
01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.850
you know,
and they,

1018
01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.260
they broke it up and they chose out and we're walking out and he goes,
you know,

1019
01:00:18.261 --> 01:00:21.520
I'm very disappointed in you just appointed me.
Fuck you.
I'm disappointed you.

1020
01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:24.170
I waited all this time to work with and we,
we,
we made up,

1021
01:00:24.171 --> 01:00:28.810
but it was never the same.
You know?
What year was that?
Oh Shit.
I don't know.
Long,

1022
01:00:28.811 --> 01:00:32.170
long time ago.
Probably 25 years ago.

1023
01:00:32.990 --> 01:00:34.640
91 92

1024
01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:37.090
<v 1>oh,
that was probably even before I met him.
Yeah.</v>

1025
01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:40.860
I worked with them in [inaudible] 94 yeah.
Yeah.
I saw him last night on a,

1026
01:00:40.861 --> 01:00:45.550
on a dumb and dumber.
Yeah,
he's great.

1027
01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:50.730
He's a great guy.
Yeah.
He has a nice,
I,
you know how he's drinking,

1028
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:52.780
I yay.

1029
01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:57.290
<v 2>Shit happens,
but you know,
it was per diem.
You know,</v>

1030
01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.200
my first couple of movies they get per day,
I go,
what's this?
You Go,
well,

1031
01:01:00.201 --> 01:01:02.990
this is put their money.
I go,
what's it for while,
you know,
to buy food,
what?

1032
01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:05.080
We get fed.
There we go.
Well,
you know what I mean?

1033
01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.550
<v 1>So I spent it,
right.
Spend it.
I didn't know you could save it,</v>

1034
01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:15.880
spend it.
And I would,
oh,
I was shit faced every day.
It was crazy.
You know?

1035
01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:20.260
But it was fun.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Lauren.
Yeah.
You learn.
Yeah.
Um,
yeah.

1036
01:01:20.261 --> 01:01:21.850
So I moved to New York and uh,

1037
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:25.950
I think it was either [inaudible] 91 or 92 and then I moved out here in 94 so it

1038
01:01:25.951 --> 01:01:29.800
wasn't in New York for a long.
And then you get news radio.
Dot.
Yeah.

1039
01:01:29.801 --> 01:01:33.400
I got hardball.
Got canceled.
That was,
yeah.
Terrible show.

1040
01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.500
But it was on,
what's that?
Fucks.
Yeah,
it was fun to flux is first shows.

1041
01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:39.790
I don't think so.
No.

1042
01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:43.150
Well married with children and Simpsons and there was a lot of shows on there.

1043
01:01:43.151 --> 01:01:47.380
They were doing sitcoms though.
That's,
yeah,
it wasn't very good.

1044
01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:48.310
It was a lot of problems with,

1045
01:01:48.311 --> 01:01:51.640
it was also an interesting thing to see that the pilot was really funny.

1046
01:01:51.850 --> 01:01:55.870
Jim Brewer was in the pilot.
The pilot was great,

1047
01:01:56.110 --> 01:01:59.110
but the pilot was made by the creators of the show and then once the network

1048
01:01:59.111 --> 01:01:59.831
decided to pick it up,

1049
01:01:59.831 --> 01:02:03.340
then they started bringing these network hacks to come in and turn it into some

1050
01:02:03.341 --> 01:02:07.930
bullshit fucking show.
And it was terrible.
They rewrote scenes and it was,

1051
01:02:07.931 --> 01:02:09.010
it was a disaster.

1052
01:02:09.070 --> 01:02:14.070
So I got to see like how really funny writers and really funny actors can put

1053
01:02:14.381 --> 01:02:17.770
together a really funny pilot and then that show could turn into dog shit

1054
01:02:17.771 --> 01:02:20.160
because of network meddling,
executive

1055
01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.310
<v 0>meddling,
and then to go from that to news radio,</v>

1056
01:02:23.311 --> 01:02:27.550
which was like the polar opposite that I was just,
they got they bay,

1057
01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:29.760
they didn't give Paul Simms much grief at all.

1058
01:02:29.761 --> 01:02:32.430
They let him do whatever the fuck you want it because he was coming from Larry

1059
01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:34.920
Sanders show and they knew he was brilliant.
And then they had,
you know,

1060
01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:39.010
working with Maura Tierney,
Steven or Steven route.

1061
01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:42.540
It's taking over this incredible,
incredible.
It was,

1062
01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:45.600
it was the luckiest Gig ever.
I couldn't believe it.
You know,

1063
01:02:45.601 --> 01:02:48.930
I've been working with those guys.
I never even took acting lessons.
I,

1064
01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.820
I had a couple acting.

1065
01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:53.250
They made me get a coach when I first got a development deal.

1066
01:02:53.251 --> 01:02:56.950
And I think I took like four or five lessons with this lady.
I was like,
Hey,

1067
01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:01.830
I had,
they'd give me a deal.
And they said,
you've got to take acting lessons.

1068
01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:06.630
I went to this acting class and this woman goes,
okay,
we're going to be a tree.

1069
01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.440
That's what kind of tree?
A big tree.

1070
01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:16.880
Willow,
I don't know what,
let's not pay.
Okay.
I,
and this and this.

1071
01:03:16.881 --> 01:03:20.430
Same on everyone caught on like ants.
Well,
ants.

1072
01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:23.910
I see.
I see a letter to go.
What?
I go,

1073
01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:27.760
I don't know why it would be an edge because what fucking movie I gotta be a

1074
01:03:27.761 --> 01:03:30.120
giant.
You know,
that's not what I'm looking for.

1075
01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:35.300
And I left and I got one two days later and everyone quit the class to like 30

1076
01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:38.910
people at the glass.
They all let me get to Sherry's.
They all fucking quit.

1077
01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.920
It was crazy.
Well,
the problem with the acting classes,

1078
01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:45.840
I mean it's good to practice to learn how to read lines,

1079
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:49.390
but it's just pretending that it was,
oh God.

1080
01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.570
I'm not saying I'm Daniel Day Lewis or I know how to do it.

1081
01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:53.940
Like one of those guys.
That's a different level of acting.
That's it.

1082
01:03:53.941 --> 01:03:57.840
But if you're on a sitcom,
right,
and if I'm a Sitcom,
I'm playing a guy like me.

1083
01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:02.310
Right.
And it's just,
it's just like standup,
but easier.
That's what it felt like.

1084
01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:07.420
And munchies,
similar way.
People said,
what?
What's,
what was it different?

1085
01:04:07.421 --> 01:04:10.230
So I said,
well,
okay,
the difference between doing a sitcom,

1086
01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:14.520
there's a camera and if something goes wrong,
we take it again and a nightclub,

1087
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:18.230
people can throw bottles at you again.
You've got dead.

1088
01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:22.710
Oh my God.
What?
I opened for Aerosmith.
Uh Oh Geez.

1089
01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.840
They used to come and see me at that stitches all the time.

1090
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:27.450
And I had no idea who they are.
When someone said,
you know what that is?
I said,

1091
01:04:27.451 --> 01:04:31.370
yes,
I'm Arrowsmith said like one of the biggest rock bands in the world.
They go,

1092
01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:33.550
you know,
I was at the disco cause it was the

1093
01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:40.950
dance.
You could get laid,
I could dance.
I was up.
I was like,

1094
01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:45.570
I was like Travolta.
It said,
how pay by which it was fun.
And that was,

1095
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:47.580
it was crazy.
So they

1096
01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:54.210
get stumped that,
so even when I was a fat guy,
I could dance.
I was like Gleason,

1097
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:59.190
you know,
uh,
they come and they said,
we want you to open fresh.

1098
01:04:59.210 --> 01:05:02.820
I go,
yeah,
no problem.
So,
Eh,
like wolf to the Orpheum theater,

1099
01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:04.810
this is one of their many comebacks.
You don't have to,

1100
01:05:04.811 --> 01:05:06.710
but they were still getting high,
I think.

1101
01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:11.280
So I go in with the crowd is going in,
you know,
and they're saying,
hey man,

1102
01:05:11.281 --> 01:05:12.720
I heard this a comedian tonight,

1103
01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.900
we're gonna fuck him up and I'm listening to this.
I'm going,
hey man,

1104
01:05:15.901 --> 01:05:18.100
I'm the comedian.
That's my,
some guys,
Lenny,

1105
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.850
<v 2>Lenny.
So they call,
what are you doing?
I said,
well I'm going to no,
no,</v>

1106
01:05:20.851 --> 01:05:23.320
you go on to stage door.
I didn't even know what to add a stage toy.

1107
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:26.350
So I go back and they're all,
I mean it was fucking wild.

1108
01:05:26.351 --> 01:05:29.060
So I go on stage and uh,

1109
01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:32.080
they stopped pooling right away and it was like runway lights.

1110
01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:33.670
Arrowsmith had decent credible lights.

1111
01:05:33.671 --> 01:05:38.671
I couldn't see any and this is but for 38 did throwing bottles and balls,

1112
01:05:38.741 --> 01:05:42.640
the smash and all around me.
Right.
And I'm going and then all,
and then he'll dad,

1113
01:05:42.641 --> 01:05:45.940
fuck you.
Bang it.
I'm good.
I'm dodging shit.

1114
01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:48.250
I can't see it coming right out of this.
I said,

1115
01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:51.370
so this kid throws a milk that hits me in the balls,

1116
01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:55.000
drops me to my fucking knees and be like damn,
milk not up here.
Yeah,

1117
01:05:55.001 --> 01:05:56.900
I think it can be right.
That nuts.

1118
01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.890
Oh it's Steven Tyler hatches bonding.

1119
01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.540
I dragged me through the curtain cause I'm right by the curtain.
How?

1120
01:06:03.541 --> 01:06:08.020
Cause I'm backing up.
I'm trying to get away.
And so there you go.

1121
01:06:08.170 --> 01:06:10.420
How much do we say we go out a couple of grand,
he goes,
here it is.

1122
01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:13.660
Come back tomorrow night.
So I'll fuck wait.

1123
01:06:13.661 --> 01:06:17.730
So I'll go back to the next night and they go,
fuck the rolling stones,
Aerosmith,

1124
01:06:17.790 --> 01:06:22.570
the greater truth until like a rally and you want to go to Japan when I was
like,

1125
01:06:22.571 --> 01:06:27.460
oh no.
So you gotta figure a workaround.
Oh,
well you,

1126
01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:31.330
you learn.
I think if you're a good comic,
you learn from your mistakes.

1127
01:06:31.331 --> 01:06:34.690
If you don't,
you know you're not going to,
you're not going to proceed.
And I did.

1128
01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.400
I had,
I had the pleasure of working with,
I work with,
uh,
uh,

1129
01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:43.360
who's pretty woman who switch a gear.
No,
no.
The Guy who sang pretty well.
Oh,

1130
01:06:43.361 --> 01:06:47.090
Roy Orbison.
Roy Orbison.
Yeah,
I think that's how bad my mind did.
I so,
um,

1131
01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:50.850
and with Kenny were up about three days and I said,
I got to go to Wooster.

1132
01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:52.450
I'm open for Roy Orbison.

1133
01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:57.280
I'm almost out of gas amount of blow.
I'm exhausted.

1134
01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:59.640
I pull into this place and uh,

1135
01:07:00.070 --> 01:07:03.790
I go up there and it's this food picking in this whole table,
all this food.

1136
01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:07.060
And I hadn't eaten that day,
so I just thought rapping.
I'm like a bear.

1137
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:10.680
So now I fall asleep.
Right.

1138
01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:14.620
I kind of

1139
01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:19.150
pushed me back.
Well,
I wake up and he's all in black.

1140
01:07:19.151 --> 01:07:21.940
He's got those glasses and it's fucking where he says,
you're the comedian.

1141
01:07:21.941 --> 01:07:26.610
I said,
yeah.
He goes,
the brilliant watch.
I'll be right back.

1142
01:07:26.611 --> 01:07:31.060
So what I do show,
great show.
I come back voice.
You are fantastic man.

1143
01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:36.250
We you want to go until I got to get some know you have some blow.

1144
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:42.010
I leave
next.
The next day man,

1145
01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:44.590
Roy Orbison asked me to go on the road with them.
You know that,

1146
01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:48.530
that work with uh,
Rachel House,
you know?
Wow.

1147
01:07:48.570 --> 01:07:51.500
And he was so good to me.
Oh Man.
He goes to London.

1148
01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:56.710
You're the funniest comedian I've never seen
then with the Vegas Vegas.

1149
01:07:56.830 --> 01:07:58.570
Oh,
he was great.
It was,
it was amazing.

1150
01:07:58.930 --> 01:08:02.260
The only prototype I have open for that I really hit it was juice Newton.

1151
01:08:02.261 --> 01:08:05.650
She was such a pitch to me,
man.
Yeah.
I was a young guy,

1152
01:08:05.651 --> 01:08:09.940
you know when I was doing like a cape cod melody tent,
you know,

1153
01:08:09.941 --> 01:08:13.990
and she was like a country star,
right.
She had one song,
she had one head.

1154
01:08:13.991 --> 01:08:15.920
I just know what it was.
Yes.

1155
01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:19.010
<v 0>She was made now.
So my buddy showed up,</v>

1156
01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:22.130
my on my high school boy climbed up and they took the Jews.

1157
01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:27.110
Not when they took the letters and put Lenny.
Yeah.
It didn't work out well.

1158
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:31.330
Yeah.
Is that what she was pissed about or no,
she was just pissed.
I Dunno.
Maybe.

1159
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:33.670
Maybe she didn't want a comedian over.
I Dunno.
You know what I mean?

1160
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.020
I was excited about meeting and you know,
she's Stein or choose to do,

1161
01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:40.640
but it's a play with that came a heights or some shit.

1162
01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:45.380
I didn't know she had one big hit.
Yeah.
A buddy of mine who was in love with her.

1163
01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:48.680
Yeah.
Juice.
Newton poster on his wall.
Every time we go over his house,
I'm like,

1164
01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:53.410
what the fuck are you telling me?
He wasted his time.
It was a long time ago.

1165
01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.490
I don't even know who that guy is anymore.
I don't remember his name,

1166
01:08:55.491 --> 01:09:00.430
but he was Mike.
But um,
you know who opens up from Metallica is brew Hula.

1167
01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:06.080
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tours with them and it apparently he's fucking sensational.

1168
01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:06.650
Oh yeah.
Well,

1169
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:11.650
because he's a big Metallica fan and he does a game show and he's so good.

1170
01:09:17.950 --> 01:09:21.460
He's great.
I love you're one of the most underrated guys ever.
Really.

1171
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:24.170
He's just so,
he doesn't give a fuck.
No.

1172
01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.350
And I said he just wants to make a living and have a good time.
You know,

1173
01:09:27.351 --> 01:09:29.940
he's not trying to get more famous in the already is,
but he's,

1174
01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.210
if you get a chance to see Jim Breuer,
holy shit,

1175
01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:34.160
he took the white for kids to Africa.

1176
01:09:34.161 --> 01:09:37.970
It was talking about the trip to Africa from Metallica.
No,
no,
just,
well,

1177
01:09:37.971 --> 01:09:39.560
I think they were there,
but he,
he,

1178
01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:43.670
he moved a wife and kids over at the typical water.
I take my kids to Africa,

1179
01:09:43.671 --> 01:09:46.110
but they would have gonna have to get malaria shots also.

1180
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:49.130
I don't want it to that.
Oh,
you know what I mean?
It's not only that,

1181
01:09:49.131 --> 01:09:51.570
but you know there's,
there's like,

1182
01:09:53.610 --> 01:09:57.560
I don't mind the lines and I don't care what is going to fuck my kid.
No,

1183
01:09:57.580 --> 01:10:00.200
but wait,
wait,
wait,
let me finish.

1184
01:10:01.090 --> 01:10:04.490
You got a mosquito with age by chin.
What happened at works?

1185
01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:08.270
It don't think that works.
I don't think it works that way.
We got to fight out.

1186
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:11.870
Yeah,
but that was what everybody was worried about law,
so it's not just me,

1187
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:17.120
but in the 80s that was one of the big fears was that mosquitoes,

1188
01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:21.260
mosquitoes are going to give,
you know,
one guy would have HIV,

1189
01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:24.200
he would get a mosquito bite and they would fly over to you and will give it to

1190
01:10:24.201 --> 01:10:28.850
you.
But then I'm sitting like monkey in the tree,
a tree monkey.

1191
01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:33.950
They isn't that how the age thinks dotty,
I think this is a,

1192
01:10:33.951 --> 01:10:35.750
there's a lot of confusion,

1193
01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:40.780
but they think it was probably from a hunter who was hunting a monkey and fuck

1194
01:10:41.361 --> 01:10:41.810
the puck.

1195
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:46.070
None of them didn't fuck them and gotten cut himself while he was cleaning the

1196
01:10:46.071 --> 01:10:50.570
monkey while he was gutting the monkey.
Because this is a very common thing.
It's,

1197
01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:51.740
it sounds disturbing,

1198
01:10:51.741 --> 01:10:56.090
but what they call bushmeat bushmeat is basically any kind of meat from any

1199
01:10:56.091 --> 01:11:00.850
kinds of things.
They shoot in the woods and they would shoot monkeys deployed,

1200
01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:02.960
pushing.
It was a whole different thing to different things

1201
01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:09.860
that back when there were bushes,
Korea,
he looks,
he called girls,
you know,

1202
01:11:09.861 --> 01:11:12.080
a Bush and people are like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

1203
01:11:12.081 --> 01:11:16.290
Like no one has a Bush anymore.
Oh God,
that's porn porn.
Change the game.

1204
01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:18.300
They changed the change.
That's the,

1205
01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:23.320
the biggest influence of pornography in American culture is not just that people

1206
01:11:23.731 --> 01:11:27.240
watch it,
but it changed the way people groom their pubic hairs.
Oh yeah.

1207
01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:30.570
I grew up mine.
I shave.
I might might've cause it makes me feel younger.

1208
01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:35.610
Good mood.
Yeah.
Once they get gray,
it's like this pressing.
Yeah.
And then,

1209
01:11:35.611 --> 01:11:39.930
you know,
you touch that little Nigga,
hey
look,

1210
01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:44.460
I'm a kid again.
Yeah.
Bush.

1211
01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:45.330
But anyway,

1212
01:11:45.330 --> 01:11:49.920
that's how aids apparently they think HIV spread from patient zero was,
uh,

1213
01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:54.990
a guy who cut himself while he was cleaning a month.
He was cutting out a monkey.

1214
01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:58.890
Well Shay,
it's just an informative show.
I did not at work.
Yeah,

1215
01:11:58.891 --> 01:12:02.330
I might be wrong about that.
Look,
I was wrong about the mosquito.
Gosh,

1216
01:12:02.331 --> 01:12:04.610
don't be hotter and I just don't think that,

1217
01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:09.910
I don't think it's as a is transmittable it's like say a malaria shape,

1218
01:12:09.970 --> 01:12:13.470
say mosquito mosquitoes transmit malaria.
Yes.
Right.

1219
01:12:13.471 --> 01:12:17.280
Well what's the difference between a good chunk of blood going into,

1220
01:12:17.281 --> 01:12:19.050
you know what I mean?
I don't think it works the same way.

1221
01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:22.050
I just think it's more difficult to transmit,

1222
01:12:22.230 --> 01:12:25.710
which is one of the reasons why men typically don't get it from sex.

1223
01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:27.570
They get it from needles.
You know,

1224
01:12:27.571 --> 01:12:31.380
women get it from sex cause it got comes inside of you and that's how you get

1225
01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:32.214
HIV.

1226
01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:37.460
This is a medical talk one on one and PR nation without your donations.

1227
01:12:39.601 --> 01:12:42.650
We can't operate.
Send that sound,
but I'll give you a nice handbag.

1228
01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:46.290
They gave you a push clippings in his swing.
He's still doing radio.

1229
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:47.220
Does he still do radio?

1230
01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:51.090
I need to ask him why he's not doing it once a week I think.
Oh,

1231
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.880
there's a little lady that he's not doing it.

1232
01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.870
He was on Zlx for a couple of years.

1233
01:12:56.890 --> 01:13:01.890
It was making some good money to zero radio in Boston anymore.
Well,

1234
01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:06.900
there's this case they still kiss and there's parental was the pioneer.

1235
01:13:07.450 --> 01:13:07.710
Yeah,

1236
01:13:07.710 --> 01:13:12.710
with the comedy hour that really helped boost comedy and he was a big proponent.

1237
01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:19.920
He helped.
He helped me an awful lot.
I remember one night he came in and he said,

1238
01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:24.510
you know,
he's got to make them move on there.
Hey Man,
I don't want to,

1239
01:13:24.511 --> 01:13:26.990
I don't want to smack you around because you know this,
this ain't going away.

1240
01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:29.680
He said,
why don't you come on my show?
I said,
I don't know how to do radio.

1241
01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:33.060
She's like,
you the best comedian.
I'm the best DJ to work.
I tried it.

1242
01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.540
We were selling out theaters.
I mean,
it was just incredible.

1243
01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:40.080
Every time we'd go on a show,
it promote.
It was,
it was incredible.

1244
01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:45.420
And I really,
I really appreciated his help,
you know.
But uh,
is he still around?

1245
01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:49.130
No,
he unfortunately passed.
I went to see,
oh,
did,

1246
01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:52.680
I went to see him two weeks before he died.
They said Max in the mass general.

1247
01:13:52.681 --> 01:13:57.660
So I went in and he started laughing and then nearly choking.
I go,

1248
01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:02.210
I said,
man,
what's going on?
And he says,
Oh,
you know,
it's,
it's not good one.

1249
01:14:02.211 --> 01:14:05.100
He only got a couple of days,
is it aids?
He said,
no.
I said,

1250
01:14:05.101 --> 01:14:08.400
so I kissed him on the forehead and he goes,
hey man,
I love you,

1251
01:14:08.401 --> 01:14:12.020
but I got got shit that don't like,
I

1252
01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:15.550
<v 2>thought it was from mosquitoes.
I can't be taking it a shot again.
What happened?</v>

1253
01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:20.320
Ah,
I don't know.
You know,
I dunno.
But I guess a lot of things went bad,
you know?

1254
01:14:20.321 --> 01:14:25.140
And you know,
is Matty in the morning still around all he,
yeah.

1255
01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:30.040
That's crazy.
He was huge back when I was delivering newspapers.

1256
01:14:30.490 --> 01:14:34.130
Chill.
He's going to be on the road almost 40 years.
Wow.

1257
01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:37.870
And they had a TV show before the radio gig.
Wow.

1258
01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:43.160
I did that.
Yeah.
Not a big guy.
I did that show.
Uh,

1259
01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:48.180
well he,
he crossed me much and I,
and across you.
Yeah.
And I flipped out,
I,

1260
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:51.720
I threatened to fight him.
So I went on to sports channel and I said,

1261
01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:57.330
I will drop a hundred pounds and fight Maddie Segal for children's cancer.

1262
01:14:58.840 --> 01:15:03.040
And then,
uh,
Barry and LH said,
we'll put the chairs,

1263
01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:03.970
will donate the chest,

1264
01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:08.560
we'll put lounge chairs in the brick and then someone to donate it,

1265
01:15:08.561 --> 01:15:13.480
the venue.
And then it got really crazy.
And then Maddie said,
listen,
I'm sorry.

1266
01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:17.780
You know,
we were doing an event that his mother passed away from it.
I said,
oh,

1267
01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:19.630
how can you know?
All right,
I'm sorry,
I paused.

1268
01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:22.600
So we're back to being friends because we have friends a long time.

1269
01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:25.240
But then you know,
I mean sometimes people,
you know,

1270
01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:28.270
you don't one thing about you that I've always said my se,

1271
01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:31.110
cause I liked you before I even knew you were a bad,
I said,

1272
01:15:31.111 --> 01:15:33.910
I just thought you were nuts.
I didn't know you were,
you know,
stone cold killer.

1273
01:15:33.911 --> 01:15:38.330
But the point is what you have such a way and,
and,

1274
01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:42.550
and other friends of mine that are just really,
you know,
dangerous people,

1275
01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:47.620
very,
very calm.
You know,
even when people,
you know,

1276
01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:51.310
push you to the limit,
you know,
which is good.

1277
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:55.090
I wish I did that cause you know,
I've been sued a few times,
you know,

1278
01:15:55.091 --> 01:16:00.090
I've learned,
I've learned to keep my hands to myself.
God.
Oh,
oh,
oh.
But I,

1279
01:16:00.230 --> 01:16:02.910
but I always,
I always admire that there was,
uh,

1280
01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:06.370
an NBA player that I want it to come for the Celtics.
Howard.
He,

1281
01:16:06.371 --> 01:16:08.770
I think he's with Charlotte now.

1282
01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:12.760
And I'd see guys swam him and he'd just turn and look,
you know,

1283
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:14.350
and like Logan Mankins for the Patriots,

1284
01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:18.280
people would smack them in the back and he turned around and just give that look

1285
01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:19.900
and then they back away.

1286
01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:24.340
I always admired people that could control the madness,
you know what I mean?

1287
01:16:24.341 --> 01:16:28.360
Cause I,
I just don't want to let the genie out of the bottle.
No,
I wasn't.

1288
01:16:28.361 --> 01:16:33.310
That's when you know things.
Can you think of people die,
go to jail,

1289
01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:38.590
<v 1>make horrible decisions when you're in a rage.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Also,
you gotta be like,</v>

1290
01:16:38.591 --> 01:16:42.310
if something does happen,
you gotta be able to stay calm while it's happening.

1291
01:16:42.311 --> 01:16:46.450
And then you see where the shots are is when people get frantic and the

1292
01:16:46.451 --> 01:16:49.390
adrenaline starts pumping and you start hyperventilating and freaking out.

1293
01:16:49.391 --> 01:16:51.080
You don't see things.
You don't,
you don't,

1294
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:55.290
you can't see things that are happening.
It's how people get hurt.
Oh yeah.

1295
01:16:55.330 --> 01:16:59.530
You learn how to do that.
When,
when in competition,
right?
Competition.

1296
01:16:59.531 --> 01:17:02.590
You can never freak out.
You never can be emotional.
If you're emotional,

1297
01:17:02.591 --> 01:17:07.150
you lose all track of what's happening.
You lose your breath,

1298
01:17:07.151 --> 01:17:10.190
you get tired quick.
I know you that big adrenaline time.

1299
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:14.600
<v 2>I have much respect for people that you know,
like MMA and in martial arts,</v>

1300
01:17:14.601 --> 01:17:17.330
all that.
I remember in college,
my freshman year of college,

1301
01:17:17.331 --> 01:17:20.120
a buddy of mine who was a fighter,
Jimmy foul,
great fighter,

1302
01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:23.960
golden gloves champion.
I mean he said,
Lenny,
I think you could be a good fighter.

1303
01:17:23.961 --> 01:17:28.100
So he took me to this gym in Springfield and I fought this Nigerian.
He was,

1304
01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.750
he was mine,
Nigeria nightmare.
He'd only been here.

1305
01:17:32.430 --> 01:17:35.700
I was like two 20 he was like in two 35 you know,

1306
01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:39.230
we couldn't even barely speak English and we got,

1307
01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:42.630
we got in the ring for the first 30 seconds.
I was,
I was so awesome.

1308
01:17:42.631 --> 01:17:46.130
But then he hit me with his shot that put me airborne.
I mean,

1309
01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:50.960
I was out cold before I hit the mat and I woke up and he was staring down,

1310
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:54.710
please don't get up man.
Please don't get up.
I said,
no problem.

1311
01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:58.010
And I realized that that wasn't,
that wasn't going to work for me,
you know.

1312
01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:01.580
I mean,
I've had lost the bar room fight,
but probably out of fear and just,

1313
01:18:01.581 --> 01:18:06.380
you know,
the fight or flight,
you know,
I want a boat that they'd both get get,

1314
01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.290
let's fight and get out of his fastest.

1315
01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:10.130
<v 1>It's always a bad idea.
Like,</v>

1316
01:18:10.170 --> 01:18:13.170
but the thing about bar fights too is like you're not fighting one person.

1317
01:18:13.171 --> 01:18:16.260
You know those other dudes around you,
you can't see them.

1318
01:18:16.261 --> 01:18:19.550
There's people that hear about it on the phone.
They come over the weight goal.

1319
01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:22.170
You want to come out,
oh yeah,
hitting you with bottles.

1320
01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:27.070
Well weren't you a bouncer?
It great woods.
Chill.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mansfield.

1321
01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:31.650
Yeah.
It was one of the,
uh,
security people.
And,
uh,

1322
01:18:31.651 --> 01:18:34.770
I quit during a Neil young concert because a Neil young,
well,

1323
01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:38.460
one of the things that we would do is we would catch people bringing in booze.

1324
01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:39.080
Right,
right,
right.

1325
01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.610
I would always have to check people's bags when they were coming in.

1326
01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:44.830
But the other thing that we do is we try to keep order in the lawn.
You know,

1327
01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:49.140
great ones has that lawn area.
Well,
one day during a Neil young concert,

1328
01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:54.141
they started having bonfires in the middle of the fucking gods are,

1329
01:18:54.950 --> 01:18:58.350
and people are lighting fires.
And we had to tell these people to start,

1330
01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:01.230
they'd put the fires out.
And I remember I had a good friend,

1331
01:19:01.231 --> 01:19:03.630
his name was Larry Jones.
He was,
uh,
the whole,

1332
01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:07.530
the whole staff of employees was like,

1333
01:19:07.531 --> 01:19:12.531
there was a few guys who was guy named alley cat who ran the [inaudible].

1334
01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:16.950
He always wanted to open up a place called libations alley cats,

1335
01:19:16.951 --> 01:19:18.940
libations and victuals.
And I remember,

1336
01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:21.220
I've always remembered that he wanted to open up a bar.
That was his dream.

1337
01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:27.000
But first time I met alley cat,
some guy had a stolen one of the golf carts.

1338
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:28.140
They had a security golf cart,

1339
01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:31.980
some drunk kid stole the golf cart and they beat the fuck out of him with walkie

1340
01:19:31.981 --> 01:19:34.530
talkies.
I'll never forget that.
I was like,
Jesus,

1341
01:19:34.531 --> 01:19:36.600
he's guys aren't planning for that.
And you know,

1342
01:19:36.601 --> 01:19:38.250
I might've been getting like 20 bucks an hour.

1343
01:19:38.251 --> 01:19:41.460
I don't remember what the fuck it was.
But I remember thinking,
Jesus,

1344
01:19:41.461 --> 01:19:44.970
I don't want to get an actual fights here because I was competing at the time.

1345
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:49.380
I was 19 years old.
So that was when I won the US Open and I was,

1346
01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:54.590
I was in the height of my competition days and this fight broke out on this lawn

1347
01:19:55.411 --> 01:19:57.840
and they were all taekwondo,
black belts,

1348
01:19:57.841 --> 01:20:00.780
all like either national champions or state champions.

1349
01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:03.840
There's like five or six of us out there and my friend Larry,

1350
01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:08.070
who was like the nicest guy in the world,
he was in some sort of a

1351
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:11.430
<v 0>altercation with his guy and I see him slam this kind of stomach and drop him</v>

1352
01:20:11.670 --> 01:20:15.300
and might fuck if Larry's punching people.
This is bad.

1353
01:20:15.330 --> 01:20:18.810
So I'd always brought a Hoodie with me because I was a coward.

1354
01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:22.470
As soon as the fights break out,
I would put a Hoodie on over my security jacket,

1355
01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:24.510
zip it up,
and I'm like,
fuck you.

1356
01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:28.280
I'm not fighting for $20 an hour out of your fucking mind.

1357
01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.210
So I put my hoodie on and I quit.

1358
01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.870
I walked right out the fucking door with everybody else and I just never,

1359
01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:37.560
I didn't collect my check that week.
I was like,
you can keep it.
I'm not dying.

1360
01:20:37.950 --> 01:20:39.540
It was brawls.
We're breaking out.

1361
01:20:39.541 --> 01:20:42.660
People were kicking people's asses and hitting people with shit and it was fire

1362
01:20:42.661 --> 01:20:45.990
everywhere and my,
my preservation instinct kicked in.
I was like,

1363
01:20:45.991 --> 01:20:49.200
there's no fucking way.
No Way I'm getting involved in this.

1364
01:20:49.201 --> 01:20:50.640
That was my last day on the job.

1365
01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:55.740
Did you have a work then perform there?
Yeah.
No,
I never performed that.

1366
01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.600
I never put them there,
but I got to see a lot of guys.

1367
01:20:57.601 --> 01:21:02.040
I got C cosmi performed there.
I saw kittens finish.
I saw Rodney.

1368
01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:04.290
This was in the Rodney bathrobe days.

1369
01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:08.850
So Rodney was backstage and one of the guys who I worked with saw as hog.

1370
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.600
Oh yeah.
So like,

1371
01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:13.470
cause he would be fucking full naked underneath his bathrobe and he had a giant

1372
01:21:13.471 --> 01:21:14.880
Dick and Dick was hanging out.

1373
01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:18.710
I spent hours putting body,

1374
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:23.480
we shot this movie out here,
all the Bali Spock's and he's should come out,
get,

1375
01:21:23.481 --> 01:21:26.580
let's go get high.
So we're in this trailer,

1376
01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:29.700
we smoke it up and he starts taking his clothes up.
He takes the robot.

1377
01:21:29.701 --> 01:21:34.210
But now he's shit him justice.
Come on,
wait,

1378
01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:39.180
you haven't seen a man's Dick before?
I go and then not,
not,
no,
not so relaxed.

1379
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:42.510
I can put something over,
you know,
he's,
he gets a fake like,
hey,

1380
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:46.770
happy now we go listen.
He goes,
I want it to be careful with this dope.

1381
01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.920
This stuff's really shy.
I said,
rod,
Abbott's smoke.
It 30 is,
I'm fine.
He goes,

1382
01:21:49.921 --> 01:21:51.690
I'm telling you it it bring you shit at the end.

1383
01:21:51.691 --> 01:21:54.950
Just bringing this in and Canoga Shit.
I

1384
01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:01.800
the shit and I'm,
oh,
pass.
Calabash is way when I live in,

1385
01:22:01.801 --> 01:22:06.750
in Merida and I go with a gamma.
How'd you do it guys?
That got lost.

1386
01:22:06.751 --> 01:22:08.070
He goes,
I tried to tell you.

1387
01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:15.580
Well the back then they had like California weed today is preposterous.

1388
01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:16.461
I mean it's,

1389
01:22:16.461 --> 01:22:20.430
it's so strong that some people are having psychotic breaks and people have

1390
01:22:20.431 --> 01:22:24.450
breakdowns and losing their mind and going into a mental institution 40 times

1391
01:22:24.451 --> 01:22:27.210
stronger than what we used.
And I smoked every day.
I used to,

1392
01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:31.080
I used to smoke him workout,
I'd smoke,
I'd ride the bike,
I'd smoke,
I'd swim,

1393
01:22:31.081 --> 01:22:32.910
I love to smoke.
I just got,
I got,

1394
01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:35.790
I thought it was more creative when I'm smoking,
you know,
it's just like,

1395
01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.390
like Collins or linings.
Oh Man,
I got writer's block.
Oh,
I'm okay.

1396
01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:45.990
But it was just,
I mean,
yeah,
now they tell me it's,
and now it's legal.

1397
01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:49.110
When I did it,
when I did get to hide it.
And where are we about it?
No,

1398
01:22:49.111 --> 01:22:49.770
it's everyone.

1399
01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:54.490
What's interesting is my wife's friends openly smoked pot now.
Like,

1400
01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:58.650
whereas like when I was younger,
like if people found out you smoke pot,

1401
01:22:58.651 --> 01:23:01.050
they would look at you like you're some sort of derelict like you were doing.

1402
01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:04.230
Yeah.
Like you were a loser.
Like even if you were successful,

1403
01:23:04.231 --> 01:23:06.010
even if you were working every day,
even

1404
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:08.820
<v 2>if you showed up on time,
if you are a pot smoker,</v>

1405
01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:11.770
and there was some sort of a that that was his big downfall.

1406
01:23:12.370 --> 01:23:16.160
He smoked up Robert Mitchum and Mitch.
Yes.
And I got him.

1407
01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:20.770
I met him before he died.
Oh yeah.
His downfall,
blah blah.
Well,
it was,

1408
01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:22.960
it was a period when it,
oh,
he said dope smoke.

1409
01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:27.280
They don't smoke dope.
It's a gateway drug.
I go,

1410
01:23:27.281 --> 01:23:31.600
you don't know what you're talking about.
Once again,
I was wrong.
Well,

1411
01:23:31.601 --> 01:23:34.490
everything's a gateway drug if you really want it to be.
Yeah.
You know,

1412
01:23:35.050 --> 01:23:38.890
but Rodney A.
Dot.
Dos Days of the bathrobe days,

1413
01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:42.640
whereas best days,
it's the a full on.
I don't give a fuck days.

1414
01:23:42.641 --> 01:23:45.490
He didn't give a fuck.
He was just Friday,

1415
01:23:45.491 --> 01:23:50.470
gave Lenny one of his first big national breaks on the HBO special.

1416
01:23:50.500 --> 01:23:55.500
And who was on your special with Lenny Schimmel hitch dice,

1417
01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:00.820
a dominant driver,
Carol Lifa,
parish Sobel,
Barry Sobel.
To this day,

1418
01:24:00.821 --> 01:24:04.210
one of the best specials ever.
It was,
it was not,
you know,

1419
01:24:04.211 --> 01:24:08.560
because we were out here and Rodney was audition and everybody for it and makes

1420
01:24:08.561 --> 01:24:11.950
you go ask him.
So I said,
Hey Rodney,
should we take a look at me as a kid?

1421
01:24:11.951 --> 01:24:15.670
I've seen people toy.
No,
no,
no.
And he walked away and he turned,
he said,
hey,

1422
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:19.270
if you could be in New York next week,
I'll take a look at.
Mike says,
well Beta.

1423
01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:23.600
So we flew back to Boston,
we took the train down and Mike says,
you have any day?

1424
01:24:23.601 --> 01:24:24.770
What?
You got to do it?
I go,
Nah.

1425
01:24:25.710 --> 01:24:29.470
So I go into the Bot and his bill Hicks at the bar and he said,
hey man,

1426
01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:32.590
nice to meet you.
I said,
you know,
I guess it's me and you up for the best spot.

1427
01:24:32.591 --> 01:24:36.310
You know,
last spot.
I may the best man win.
We'll have have a drink afterwards.

1428
01:24:36.311 --> 01:24:39.220
She goes,
I'm drinking now.
And it goes wrong.
Fucking answer.
I went out,

1429
01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:42.340
I punched the fucking phone,
but there's a long ago I was so pissed.

1430
01:24:42.341 --> 01:24:44.050
And Ronnie goes,
who wants to go first?
I do.

1431
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:47.740
So I went on and I fucking burnt the top around and he goes,
Jesus Christ,

1432
01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:52.300
now you're on the show now.
I said,
it's not my problem,
but I,

1433
01:24:52.301 --> 01:24:54.850
but a man shot and he's in the bathroom.
Yeah,
of course.

1434
01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:57.310
So we've got to be good friends.

1435
01:24:57.311 --> 01:25:02.170
One night we left there and we went up to a tavern on the green.

1436
01:25:02.230 --> 01:25:06.520
Okay.
And he said,
well,
he's in a bathrobe.
We don't blow a drank at smoking.

1437
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:10.460
And we'd get out.
We'd go up the doorman or not tonight.
Rod,

1438
01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:15.470
you've got some nice people and everything.
Get a job.
You looking at all,

1439
01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:17.410
you're welcome.
All the fuck you come on.

1440
01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:24.240
So you saw Hicks when he was in his drinking stage?
Yeah,

1441
01:25:24.730 --> 01:25:28.760
I only saw him after drinking.
I saw him post drinking.
Yeah,

1442
01:25:28.930 --> 01:25:32.650
I saw him at Nick's,
uh,
well the first time I saw him,

1443
01:25:32.710 --> 01:25:36.430
I saw him at the connection of summit,
Nixon assignment,
the connection.

1444
01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:41.010
Those are the two places.
Yeah.
W we became friends after that.
But I mean it was,

1445
01:25:41.050 --> 01:25:43.590
that was,
you know,
I,
I'm just trying to be a good guy.
You know,

1446
01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:48.370
it's sometimes it's the competitive juices.
I don't,

1447
01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:52.130
not sure what it is.
It comes out.
That was the,
well,
the,

1448
01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:56.800
one of the things that comics of today talk about is how it is a different thing

1449
01:25:56.801 --> 01:25:59.770
in the community now.
Like the comics community is very supportive.

1450
01:25:59.890 --> 01:26:01.680
There's no competitiveness anymore.
Right.

1451
01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:03.950
It's not the same because it's not like everybody's

1452
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:08.160
<v 0>up for a limited amount of slots on like an HBO young comedian.
Special Gosh.</v>

1453
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:10.550
Or Carson does none of that.
In fact,

1454
01:26:10.551 --> 01:26:13.550
everybody helps everybody because everybody does everybody's podcast.

1455
01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:17.180
Everybody supports everybody.
We worked together on the road together.
It's like,

1456
01:26:17.210 --> 01:26:20.480
it's a different vibe.
Oh yeah.
What I was coming up,
it was like that.

1457
01:26:20.481 --> 01:26:23.230
It was all cut.
Let's cut.
Dot.
Yeah.
Oh is,

1458
01:26:23.231 --> 01:26:25.040
and everybody wanted everybody to bomb after him.

1459
01:26:26.230 --> 01:26:30.040
<v 2>I,
I always felt,
I said,
look,
if one of us makes it,</v>

1460
01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:32.140
we kicked the door down for everyone else,

1461
01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:35.460
but people were making it ahead of me and it was slamming that door.
Shut up.

1462
01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:42.370
You better sleep.
But what I open,
you'll fuck it.
I'm not going away.

1463
01:26:42.850 --> 01:26:45.000
And that's why I had to go from La.

1464
01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:49.750
I come out here and make no money and Michiko you'd be funny if you are red

1465
01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:53.820
tiling.
Okay,
I'll get a red tie.
Oh,
that's so much better.
And she met,

1466
01:26:53.821 --> 01:26:57.580
she was great to me.
I mean,
she,
she,
she went,
when I broke through that sir,

1467
01:26:57.581 --> 01:27:01.420
right there.
Oh,
I know.
I love it.
So she sits to me.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1468
01:27:01.421 --> 01:27:05.200
Like Leno joke,
joke,
joke.
I go,
isn't that what it's supposed to be?
You know?

1469
01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:10.370
And I know.
I Dunno.
I really don't.
I know,
but,

1470
01:27:10.410 --> 01:27:14.470
but,
but she said,
you're not going to go away.
I said,
no,
I'm not going to.
Okay,

1471
01:27:14.471 --> 01:27:15.700
you're a regular.
I said,
what's that mean?

1472
01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:19.690
They get like $25 now that would pay for my pocket,
you know.

1473
01:27:19.960 --> 01:27:24.520
So I flew back and forth from Boston and he let me work in everywhere and I'd

1474
01:27:24.521 --> 01:27:28.430
make enough money to live out here.
And I did every weekend for eight,

1475
01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.300
<v 0>10 months.</v>

1476
01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:32.210
But it was so smart that you did that because you were one of the few guys that

1477
01:27:32.211 --> 01:27:36.380
left Boston.
Right.
All these brilliant comedian Roger Hodgson and yeah,

1478
01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.510
<v 2>the Gab.
Yeah.</v>

1479
01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:43.260
Donovan and all these guys don't Tony Box.
Tony V.
Yeah.

1480
01:27:43.770 --> 01:27:48.740
There were guys that,
you know,
if they went to Boston and got on stage Jericho,

1481
01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:53.680
he's right.
That burned the room.
Dot.
[inaudible]

1482
01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:57.470
<v 0>saw in during the 80s and the early 90 [inaudible] I saw some of the best</v>

1483
01:27:57.471 --> 01:28:02.360
standup I ever saw in my life.
What guys would murder.
It's hard to explain it to.

1484
01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:07.440
Ya had to,
you had to.
So what will,
you couldn't look the guys in the face.
Yeah.

1485
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:11.840
Rogers and go,
wow,
you really sucked.
Everyone was ruthless.

1486
01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:15.800
They were ruthless.
But the,
the level of comedy was so high.
Yeah.

1487
01:28:15.801 --> 01:28:20.270
Like on a Saturday night you could see Lenny Sweeney,
Gavin,
Steve Wright,

1488
01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:22.880
all on the same show and it was crazy.

1489
01:28:22.881 --> 01:28:24.530
And then they would occasionally at Nick's,

1490
01:28:24.710 --> 01:28:28.880
Nick's was the biggest culprit in this,
where they would bring in some local,

1491
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:31.530
some national guys.
Skippy,
yeah.

1492
01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:35.270
Some things brought in skipped terror family who would sell some tickets,

1493
01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:39.320
but then they would set them up and they'd have to follow these kids was foul up

1494
01:28:39.321 --> 01:28:43.160
fucking assassin group.
I mean it was,
it was crazy.

1495
01:28:43.161 --> 01:28:46.370
It was a a murderer's row.
I have some of the best comics ever.

1496
01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:50.480
I remember Richard Lewis came and I love Richard Lewis and I think he's a great

1497
01:28:50.481 --> 01:28:54.650
comic,
but he came in and Gav goes,
hey man,
have you seen this Richard Lewis?

1498
01:28:54.651 --> 01:28:58.100
I said,
no.
He goes,
watch this special.
So I watched him and I go,

1499
01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:02.010
it's going to be cannon fodder.
He goes,
what?
I go,
he goes,

1500
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:02.761
<v 2>listen,
I'm telling you,</v>

1501
01:29:02.761 --> 01:29:06.690
it's a lot different from from filming and being onstage at Nick's.

1502
01:29:06.930 --> 01:29:09.660
So we came in,
it was me swinging and Gavin and him.

1503
01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:14.040
And so we go on and we burn it down and he goes on and then he goes back to the

1504
01:29:14.041 --> 01:29:18.780
hotel 57 and turns on channel four and sees Joyce Kobe work,

1505
01:29:18.900 --> 01:29:22.800
butchering him in a review.
And he comes back and he goes,

1506
01:29:22.830 --> 01:29:27.120
I can't believe this has happened.
I go,
hey man,
listen,
you're a great guy.
Open.

1507
01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:29.520
I said,
we'll take care of it.
He goes,
really?
I said,
yeah,

1508
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.060
don't blow him throwing shit out the window.
So you guys were insane.

1509
01:29:33.570 --> 01:29:38.250
And six months later,
I do my first movie,
uh,
the wrong guys with him.

1510
01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:41.700
And he says,
I never forget what you did in Boston.
He was so nice to me,
you know,

1511
01:29:41.701 --> 01:29:43.980
and I was a wreck because I didn't do movies.
Well,

1512
01:29:43.981 --> 01:29:46.560
it's a terrible position for a comic like him to be,

1513
01:29:46.561 --> 01:29:48.270
because he wasn't that kind of comic.

1514
01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:53.460
It was like a guy would pontificate and he had these long pauses and stories and

1515
01:29:53.461 --> 01:29:57.540
stories.
Funny.
But yeah,
these people don't,
we don't want fuck joke.

1516
01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:01.500
Make us laugh out,
go,
go,
go.
And had to be set up right?
Yeah.

1517
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:04.890
A fee out of like a low key opener.
He would have fun,

1518
01:30:05.410 --> 01:30:10.080
which I bet he got most of the time on the ride and not,
not crazy filthy you.

1519
01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:14.840
No,
no,
no,
no.
Shut up.
Silly.
Fuck you.
I'll come down.
I'm going to fucking stack.

1520
01:30:17.210 --> 01:30:21.630
Well you know it was a very unusual group.
Guys have guys in Boston too,

1521
01:30:21.631 --> 01:30:26.631
cause they're all giant dudes like between you and Gavin and Sweeney and knocks.

1522
01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:27.930
They're big men.

1523
01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:32.000
You know like these are big intimidating men who are doing standup.

1524
01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:35.860
Do you remember the dorm had Billy?
Sure.
Big Foot.

1525
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:39.090
He nearly killed me one night.
Right?
Well dormant at Nick's.
Yeah.

1526
01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:41.820
So these kids come in and go,
hey man,
he goes,
we're sold out.

1527
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:43.500
He gets $200 goes come with me.

1528
01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:47.250
He walks down to the front row it takes for kids from Charlestown screw,

1529
01:30:47.310 --> 01:30:51.480
get out and puts those guys die.
Come back next week.
I mean that's how it was.

1530
01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:54.930
It was just crazy.
It was insane.
You gotta keep your head down.

1531
01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:58.150
Oh young comic or keep your mouth shut and keep your head down.

1532
01:30:58.350 --> 01:31:02.520
Don't get on anybody's bad side.
They told him I did.
I was doing it.

1533
01:31:02.670 --> 01:31:07.670
The connection and upstairs was a show with trans transvestites.

1534
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:13.840
People dressed up like guys dressed up like women before there was titled as a

1535
01:31:13.850 --> 01:31:17.700
drag Queen Show and there was no,
there was no heat.

1536
01:31:18.170 --> 01:31:21.260
All the heat was in the,
in the middle room at the connection I got look at,

1537
01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:24.750
he's pulling passage going up there and I see some guy singing,

1538
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:29.830
dancing and dredge freezing their asses off rights halftime break before the

1539
01:31:29.881 --> 01:31:34.320
next show and Billy comes storming in the back room at the connection.

1540
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:37.500
He goes,
who's Luddy cluck?
And Steve Wright goes,
Oh yeah,

1541
01:31:42.100 --> 01:31:42.933
what am I going to with this?

1542
01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:46.920
I mean this would bait and they take me down to Knicks and they take me down to

1543
01:31:46.930 --> 01:31:49.280
San,
they go,
you know that fucking show you're making.

1544
01:31:49.281 --> 01:31:53.100
Do you know that that bag show you made fun of what we're producing at?
You?

1545
01:31:53.101 --> 01:31:56.220
Ever say that again?
They'll find you dead in the fucking river.

1546
01:31:56.221 --> 01:32:00.920
Do you understand?
Yes,
I do.
That,

1547
01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:05.320
should I have to go do the show,
you know?
Yeah,
no,
they were stone cold killers.

1548
01:32:05.830 --> 01:32:09.490
He was friends with my buddy,
Joe Lake who is my boxing coach.

1549
01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:13.300
And I brought Joe Lake to the show on it and they were buddies together and Joe

1550
01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:15.690
Lake was a savage and I'm like,
he's friends with this guy.
He started,

1551
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:18.280
he's in jail animals.
He said he's in jail.

1552
01:32:19.340 --> 01:32:24.100
He was I sorry,
sorry.
Sorry.
Maybe.

1553
01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:27.310
Maybe it doesn't have a radius.
Maybe it doesn't have to be sure he was innocent.

1554
01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:31.390
Y'All ever happened?
He probably had a bad attorney.
Yeah,

1555
01:32:31.391 --> 01:32:34.750
it was a bunch of animals then.
And people were literally getting paid in coke.

1556
01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:37.630
Oh yeah.
My First Gig down in Florida,

1557
01:32:38.050 --> 01:32:42.900
I did a place in Sarasota and it was a great weekend again.
So Sandra Week,

1558
01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:47.710
uh,
two grand,
he goes,
how do you want it?
You want it in cash or coke?

1559
01:32:47.711 --> 01:32:52.010
And I'm about half and half,
half,

1560
01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:55.880
half and coke and yeah,
it was nuts.
Then I got whacked out and with the tap.

1561
01:32:55.881 --> 01:33:00.270
But she,
Jackie the joke man,
cause I had met him and he goes,
how did you get him?

1562
01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:03.750
Like I really don't know.
I,

1563
01:33:03.970 --> 01:33:08.350
it was like the time I was so fucked up back then it was like time travel,

1564
01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:08.980
you know,

1565
01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:13.980
you could get me blowing booze in a car and I could end up from Sarasota to

1566
01:33:14.191 --> 01:33:16.630
tamp.
You look at that on a map.
That's not an easy gig.

1567
01:33:16.750 --> 01:33:21.380
That's not an easy trip now.
And I would just show up and it was gps.

1568
01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:25.880
There was fucking old wooden bridge and you know,
what are you doing here?

1569
01:33:25.881 --> 01:33:30.460
Like I said,
I got bloke come on in and figured out how to get there.
God Christ.

1570
01:33:30.461 --> 01:33:34.990
And I remember we used to call when you get a Gig back in the day and then some

1571
01:33:34.991 --> 01:33:39.110
of them will be in New Hampshire and some weird fucking lodge.
The Lodge,

1572
01:33:40.780 --> 01:33:44.740
ironically I'm doing a lot with night.
This strip is male.

1573
01:33:44.741 --> 01:33:47.790
Strippers can know what the high school,
it's a male strip.
Right.
And the door.

1574
01:33:47.850 --> 01:33:52.840
And I said,
I'm emceeing,
you know,
and I got to do comedy between,
so I go,
Kathy,

1575
01:33:52.841 --> 01:33:57.280
is Kathy O'malley here?
Your kid fell down and hurt his head.
Fuck,

1576
01:33:57.281 --> 01:33:59.380
you show a Chicago.

1577
01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:06.370
Oh,
well we get the directions.
It would just,

1578
01:34:06.371 --> 01:34:08.230
you'd have to write them down on illegal.
Right.

1579
01:34:08.530 --> 01:34:10.720
Let's write down and take a ride at the fork,
you know,

1580
01:34:10.721 --> 01:34:14.740
and then you go two miles and this road.
Yeah,
right.
It's in,
it's in,

1581
01:34:14.741 --> 01:34:18.820
it's in Salem.
You'll find it.
That's what they'd say.
So small when you get there.

1582
01:34:18.850 --> 01:34:22.960
One night he had me work in Rhode Island,
Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

1583
01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:26.170
Three gigs.
And I go in a night.
That's a lot of fucking driving.
He says,

1584
01:34:26.171 --> 01:34:30.650
you get though it don't want me.
And I mean,

1585
01:34:30.690 --> 01:34:32.020
I know how I did what up,
you know,

1586
01:34:32.021 --> 01:34:35.470
get killed or killing someone if it's a crazy Rhode Island was always fun.

1587
01:34:35.530 --> 01:34:40.030
And then would Kennison w w w when I first met Kennison out at the store,
I said,

1588
01:34:40.150 --> 01:34:44.140
oh my God.
It was like a revel.
I'd never seen anything.
And I've seen everybody,

1589
01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:49.030
right.
I said,
this is so I call him,
you got to see this fucking guy.
He's nuts,

1590
01:34:49.031 --> 01:34:52.990
man.
It's unbelievable.
He's like this preacher.
What does comedy,
that's insane.

1591
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:57.990
And so,
uh,
we bring them to Boston and my mix is the first star fight.

1592
01:34:58.430 --> 01:35:01.400
I had to fire him after the first show.
Why he,

1593
01:35:01.460 --> 01:35:04.460
he showed up all fucked up and you know,

1594
01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:09.020
I got him some blow and he went on stage and he just,

1595
01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:12.740
he was doing like new material and I said,
Sam,

1596
01:35:12.741 --> 01:35:16.430
is there any way you could do your HBO?
He goes,
no,
Bro,
that's been done.

1597
01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:20.770
That's been done.
And I go,
well,
I gotta let you go.
He goes,
I figured that.

1598
01:35:21.390 --> 01:35:24.920
Then they got him a Gig at the connection,
then he got fired from there.

1599
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:27.380
Then you had him a place in Malden.
You get five,

1600
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:32.140
he shows up at stitches at my gig and he comes walking in and like,
oh,

1601
01:35:32.210 --> 01:35:36.360
Sandman I,
I can't lose this cake.
This is my,
this is my big money gig.

1602
01:35:36.710 --> 01:35:41.360
Do the,
trust me.
Do you trust the bees?
Did trust the bees bring me,
I say,

1603
01:35:41.370 --> 01:35:42.141
Ladies and gentlemen,
you know,

1604
01:35:42.141 --> 01:35:47.141
you saw him on the HBO Saturday night live is one of the best I've ever seen.

1605
01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:51.400
Sam [inaudible],
he come stumbling out,
what half a bottle.

1606
01:35:51.401 --> 01:35:55.670
I'm away chugs it down burps and says someone's fucking meet tonight.

1607
01:35:56.030 --> 01:36:00.800
And from then on he just found out the room.
Dot.
And by the end of the night,

1608
01:36:00.970 --> 01:36:04.790
they had hired him to come back to do the back room at the paradise and it was

1609
01:36:04.791 --> 01:36:09.220
off and running.
But Oh my God,
this is like 86 yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

1610
01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:14.510
yeah.
So we're in New York and with doing Caroline's right.

1611
01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:17.810
And I mean everybody was,
everybody comes out to see the show.

1612
01:36:17.811 --> 01:36:21.890
It's unbelief and they're going to do a rolling stone.

1613
01:36:21.891 --> 01:36:25.550
He's on the cover of rolling stone and he's supposed to do the today show.

1614
01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:26.840
And so he,

1615
01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:31.640
he flies in every girl that's ever broke up with them and puts them all up in

1616
01:36:31.641 --> 01:36:35.620
the same hotel,
different floors.
Oh my God,

1617
01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:41.820
you missed that.
Crazy.

1618
01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:46.960
So I had told a story more than the small group of people,

1619
01:36:47.211 --> 01:36:52.190
but we're in the room and I'm lying on this side of the bed,

1620
01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.160
brought his bill,
his mom's dead.
Samsung patched up the chair.

1621
01:36:55.460 --> 01:37:00.050
We've been gone for days and Samhsa money goes,

1622
01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:04.640
Lenny,
you've got to get Sam up.
It's got to today's show and I the today show.

1623
01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:06.470
That's huge,
man.
We can't pull this up.

1624
01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:11.360
And he was just at the point where he didn't care anymore.
I thought,
so,
uh,

1625
01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:14.840
I said,
Sam,
Sam,
get up,
get up.
You got into it.
She mother wants you to do it.

1626
01:37:14.841 --> 01:37:16.370
This is big.
It's great for your career.

1627
01:37:16.670 --> 01:37:19.530
And we turn on the TV and he's putting on his fucking money.

1628
01:37:19.531 --> 01:37:24.290
He's put on a scope and this challenge,
it takes off.
And we also,
we watch,

1629
01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:29.150
it explodes.
He goes,
I will days high fucking,
well,

1630
01:37:29.151 --> 01:37:30.970
there's the,
everyone packed a bag

1631
01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:36.650
and his mother's just got,
Oh,
then the phone rings.

1632
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:41.600
This today show we won't be using Sam today.
Oh my God,
I will.

1633
01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:42.493
I will.

1634
01:37:46.530 --> 01:37:48.430
He goes,
you know,
he goes,
that was a horrible,

1635
01:37:48.431 --> 01:37:50.950
I think that happened and lose all those assets.
But you know,

1636
01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:54.220
I guess she was a teacher,
you know,
I forget her name and he goes,

1637
01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:56.870
and the kids were in the classroom and they'll watch it.

1638
01:37:59.490 --> 01:38:04.400
Anyone want some cookie?
This cake,
this cake.
I'm right after it.
I mean,

1639
01:38:04.401 --> 01:38:08.000
you know,
but he was,
he was fearless.
Phyllis.
Yeah,
he was,

1640
01:38:08.690 --> 01:38:10.020
I don't know if you know the story about him,

1641
01:38:10.021 --> 01:38:11.940
but his brother Bill wrote that book,

1642
01:38:11.941 --> 01:38:16.380
brother Sam and he talked about how Sam got hit by a car when he was a little

1643
01:38:16.381 --> 01:38:21.210
kid.
He was a normal kid and he gets this horrible head injury and then all of a

1644
01:38:21.211 --> 01:38:25.650
sudden was fearless.
Like that happened.
Roseanne and that happened to him.

1645
01:38:25.770 --> 01:38:29.010
Same exact story,
hit by a car.
I didn't know.

1646
01:38:29.100 --> 01:38:30.870
One personality changes.

1647
01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:35.250
A 100% becomes a totally different personality and becomes his wild,

1648
01:38:35.280 --> 01:38:39.000
reckless person.
Uh,
having a bolt of them.
Listen,
you know,

1649
01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:43.860
all these Elisa,
these documentaries about him and stuff.

1650
01:38:43.890 --> 01:38:47.400
And I see people that were on the peripheral edges.
I mean,

1651
01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:51.220
I was with him for a few years.
I mean pregnant with the bar.

1652
01:38:51.510 --> 01:38:55.160
We brought up to Boston when he wasn't making a lot of money and might pay him.

1653
01:38:55.170 --> 01:39:00.170
And He loved it and we became real good friends and it was,

1654
01:39:00.181 --> 01:39:05.100
uh,
it was just a time in life that I never saw anything like that.

1655
01:39:05.490 --> 01:39:08.150
What do you break into the preacher thing with his little feet dancing.

1656
01:39:09.630 --> 01:39:11.940
So one night we're up,

1657
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.900
he started canceling missing cakes and he missed the University of Arizona.

1658
01:39:16.410 --> 01:39:20.800
And uh,
his manager goes and he had to pick time mansion and they had just got,

1659
01:39:20.801 --> 01:39:24.240
um,
you know,
the cover of rolling stone and all that stuff.
And he goes,
let me,

1660
01:39:24.241 --> 01:39:28.850
you've got to get him to the show.
We're open it for him.
I said,
okay.
So Sam goes,

1661
01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:30.030
come out,
we'll go back to the place,

1662
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:34.980
but doing massive amounts of blowing shit and I'm getting up to go to the

1663
01:39:34.981 --> 01:39:35.814
bathroom.

1664
01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:40.960
He's never gets up to go to the bathroom because I smashed up with when Tampa

1665
01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:46.560
and we're doing the show.
It was the year that Tampa lost every game,

1666
01:39:46.620 --> 01:39:49.670
that professional football team and they came in and some big offensive linemen

1667
01:39:49.671 --> 01:39:52.560
pick us guys ever say,
can we meet Sammy?
We've got Sam,
these guys want to meet.

1668
01:39:53.100 --> 01:39:57.220
And one of them breaks out,
a little bloats have it goes,
blows away and it,
Whoa,

1669
01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:00.680
it takes out a bag,
puts it down and not doing a rush.

1670
01:40:00.681 --> 01:40:03.730
You push and walks up and they're looking at him like,
yeah,
he's not human.

1671
01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:08.220
We go back to his place and now it's three in the morning.

1672
01:40:08.430 --> 01:40:10.920
It's four and a monitor.
It was supposed to take a seven o'clock flight.

1673
01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:13.950
And I said,
yeah,
but not going to make that flight is eight o'clock flight.

1674
01:40:14.380 --> 01:40:18.120
It's only an hour out of,
you know,
La to Arizona.
That right.
So,

1675
01:40:18.510 --> 01:40:23.160
so 10 o'clock the,
the uh,
manager shows up and let me go say,
hey man,

1676
01:40:23.430 --> 01:40:25.660
this is not good.
This is a makeup show you,

1677
01:40:25.670 --> 01:40:28.740
you didn't show and makeup showed it's sold out.
Yeah.
He goes,

1678
01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:33.240
take Lenny wigeon and I'll be,
I'll follow up.
So we're in the,

1679
01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:36.420
we're in the plane and he says,
how much time he got done.
He said,
well,

1680
01:40:36.421 --> 01:40:41.070
how much do you need?
He goes,
well,
you know,
until he gets it.
So I go on,

1681
01:40:41.071 --> 01:40:45.210
I'm supposed to do 20 I'm,
I'm at about 54 and I'm going,
man,

1682
01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:47.550
I'm running and I'm holding them off.
Your Sam seven.

1683
01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:52.030
I hold them all and I look over and he's on an oxygen tank with a mass.

1684
01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:57.750
It was the big Cody's premium that dad live that dead lab premium.

1685
01:40:59.250 --> 01:41:04.090
I bring him on and the place goes crazy.
Crazy,
crazy,
crazy.

1686
01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:08.460
At afterwards we'd go to some Strip club,
right?
And so we're in it.

1687
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:11.460
Everyone's wild,
man.
He's a pig sty.
You know what I mean?
People can't pollute it.

1688
01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:12.221
So I sit in,

1689
01:41:12.221 --> 01:41:15.490
all the strippers come over and he's throwing money around and someone throws a

1690
01:41:15.491 --> 01:41:18.520
can of beer and he goes,
that's it.
He goes,

1691
01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:20.190
you guys want to make more money in a night?

1692
01:41:20.191 --> 01:41:21.730
Then you're making a month to come with me.

1693
01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:25.390
And we got about eight of them come and we get in a limo and we go back to the

1694
01:41:25.391 --> 01:41:29.070
hotel and we're up though.
Tell me,
well,
magic trick I me.
And he goes,
Lenny.

1695
01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:32.200
He goes,
I know you're married.
He goes,
but in about five minutes,

1696
01:41:32.201 --> 01:41:36.910
things are going to change.
You might want to go.
He says,

1697
01:41:36.911 --> 01:41:40.960
because once you open this door,
you'll never be able to close it again.

1698
01:41:41.570 --> 01:41:44.230
And I thought,
my s all right brother.
Okay.

1699
01:41:44.310 --> 01:41:46.300
And so I left and went back to my room,

1700
01:41:46.301 --> 01:41:49.630
get back an extra cookie from the doubletree room and my room.

1701
01:41:49.780 --> 01:41:54.780
So the next morning I get up and I go over to the room and I opened it up and

1702
01:41:54.851 --> 01:41:57.790
it's fucking destroyed in this blood.

1703
01:41:57.791 --> 01:42:00.610
Everyone sitting around crying,

1704
01:42:02.690 --> 01:42:05.620
Sam,
oh,
it was,
I,

1705
01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:09.580
I don't know what the fuck this.

1706
01:42:09.670 --> 01:42:13.930
So I try to get a cab,
I go to the airport and I fly back.

1707
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:18.820
And till this day I never know what happened.
There was one guy magic.

1708
01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:22.270
I mean,
if you ever listen to his magic,
fine,
because I want to know what,

1709
01:42:22.271 --> 01:42:27.040
but it looked like it looked like a bomb when of shit was broken.

1710
01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:32.020
All of them.
I mean like I trashed my place,
but like dangerously trashed and,

1711
01:42:32.090 --> 01:42:35.740
and blood and still still blow Leptin and oh,
it was,

1712
01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:37.600
I don't know what happened at night.
You know,

1713
01:42:37.601 --> 01:42:42.520
Mark Marin was hanging out with him back in the day when mark was a doorman at

1714
01:42:42.521 --> 01:42:45.330
the comedy store and he was a young kid.
Yeah.

1715
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:50.350
He did so much coke with Kinison that he heard voices for a year.

1716
01:42:51.190 --> 01:42:52.420
His head was broken.

1717
01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:55.570
He heard voices in his head for a fucking year and that's when he sobered up.

1718
01:42:55.750 --> 01:42:59.260
He came to Boston right after that.
That's when I met him.

1719
01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:01.550
I met Martin and 88 when he had just,

1720
01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:05.980
just was trying to get his brain back online.
Right?
Yeah.
He was fried,

1721
01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:08.500
cooked his brain.
It was just up for days.
Oh,

1722
01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:12.010
not many people could run on its side shut.
We're,
we're in Boston and we,

1723
01:43:12.670 --> 01:43:15.250
I think we do stitches and we closed.
I said,
come on.

1724
01:43:15.251 --> 01:43:19.120
We'll go over to Lansdowne street cause buddy Vassar's running that.

1725
01:43:19.121 --> 01:43:22.830
So now we're drinking bottles of champagne like it's gone.
I said,
that's it.

1726
01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:26.560
It's enough.
We got to go.
So we leave.
A champ goes,
where are we going now?

1727
01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:30.730
I Dunno man.
It's this.
There's no bars open.
It's after two.
He goes,

1728
01:43:30.731 --> 01:43:34.690
you got to know a place.
I go,
most of the place,
I know that they're folded up,

1729
01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:39.490
they've been shut down.
He goes,
wait a minute.
He goes,
the limbo.

1730
01:43:39.491 --> 01:43:42.640
We had the,
and I'd had booze is,
yeah,
call the limo.

1731
01:43:43.090 --> 01:43:46.210
So they call it a limit when it comes fully stocked.
I goes,

1732
01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:51.080
never underestimate my Bali.
Drinking is bad.

1733
01:43:51.110 --> 01:43:54.950
It Brad,
that shallow shit happened that middle.
I mean it just,
it was insane.

1734
01:43:55.250 --> 01:44:00.110
Just not human.
He's a wild motherfucker.
He changed comedy.
He really did.

1735
01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:04.610
Oh,
oh,
he changed what comedy was it?
It became something like before him,

1736
01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:08.300
it was people telling jokes,
but he was so outrageous.

1737
01:44:08.301 --> 01:44:12.440
And when he did that HBO special,
that one that he did from the Roxy on sunset,

1738
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:15.830
obviously.
Yeah.
That fucking special changed.
Common.

1739
01:44:16.030 --> 01:44:17.660
Like it changed people's idea.

1740
01:44:17.661 --> 01:44:22.610
Like when he did that joke about the homosexual necrophilia sex on my way to

1741
01:44:22.730 --> 01:44:27.320
heaven.
So

1742
01:44:29.010 --> 01:44:32.060
I bet there's still one night I go in and the cops,

1743
01:44:32.090 --> 01:44:35.660
the cops left Sam and it was like about seven squad cars out in front of the

1744
01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:39.170
competition.
Go Sam,
you go.
And there were all aligned.
The wallet,

1745
01:44:39.190 --> 01:44:42.590
the steps involved them.
I watch him and he's bombing,
you know,
I mean,

1746
01:44:44.670 --> 01:44:48.160
yeah,
it's you.
People don't seem to like me.
I don't want it to be fair.
I have,

1747
01:44:48.161 --> 01:44:52.520
I'm at,
you know,
when you go home tonight,
I want you to take a piece of paper,

1748
01:44:52.530 --> 01:44:55.370
a Napkin,
something,
anything.
And I want you to write on it.

1749
01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:58.970
Someone in your life that's passed,
you know,
a brother,
a sister,

1750
01:44:58.971 --> 01:45:00.320
a mother to sacred dead.

1751
01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:04.140
I want you to take that home and I want you to get home and I want you to Ypo.

1752
01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:04.993
Fuck

1753
01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:12.140
so fucking fun.
And ever who he would,

1754
01:45:12.290 --> 01:45:16.730
he would leave like 20 or 30 tickets for the cops in that town wherever we were.

1755
01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:20.300
And Really?
Yeah,
yeah,
no,
the cops would always show up.
Oh,
that's awesome.
I,

1756
01:45:20.330 --> 01:45:25.330
the one night we were up at Mitsis and he's up there jamming with Eric Clapton,

1757
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:30.520
Phil Collins,
I forget who the other guy was,
and then Rhonda boy,

1758
01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:35.060
and he's got the cottage and walking it out,
right?
And I'm going,
I can't play,

1759
01:45:35.061 --> 01:45:39.320
but on Monday she's in shame.
And so the cops come,
he goes,

1760
01:45:39.321 --> 01:45:42.460
let me take care of it.
So I grew up in is like three,
four cars.

1761
01:45:42.490 --> 01:45:45.800
The lights go and I go,
what's up?
I said,
hey,
you got to cut it down.
I said,

1762
01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:48.170
Oh man,
young can believe it.
Eric Clapton Zine.
Anyway,

1763
01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:50.750
Phil Collins and the Jama Salmon exam,

1764
01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:54.650
can we meet psychonautic go Sam the cops.
It's okay,

1765
01:45:54.651 --> 01:45:58.220
but you've got to come up and take a picture with him and you fuck I should Sam.

1766
01:45:58.221 --> 01:46:01.320
I said,
Gee,
dad ended up closing it down.
So he goes up and they have pulled away.

1767
01:46:01.340 --> 01:46:03.620
That's when they had the Polaroid cameras and they took,

1768
01:46:03.630 --> 01:46:07.190
Paul had me taking the Polaroids and Sam and the cops.
It was what,
what?

1769
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:09.680
I'd love to see those pictures,
but it was,

1770
01:46:09.740 --> 01:46:11.120
you never know who going to come over there.

1771
01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:13.850
You never know who it was going to come over.
It was just incredible.

1772
01:46:14.150 --> 01:46:17.300
He's the example that I always give to comics.
Have A,

1773
01:46:17.301 --> 01:46:21.770
a guy who was at one point in time,
one of the best ever.

1774
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:26.240
Oh yeah.
But then dropped off hard,
like he dropped off in a big way.

1775
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:29.780
Just stop writing too much partying.
His brother talked about it in the book.

1776
01:46:30.290 --> 01:46:32.210
He just,
it's what can happen.

1777
01:46:32.250 --> 01:46:35.570
Like can't you got to respect this fucking thing.

1778
01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:40.910
And he was just all about the ride.
And then also he became very,
very famous.

1779
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:43.650
Probably two famous,
right.
You know.
Well we,

1780
01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:46.650

That's how long ago.

1781
01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:52.530
And uh,
he had driven out to Mayo to my Iowa Suki.

1782
01:46:53.010 --> 01:46:57.370
And uh,
I got a call early in the morning,

01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:00.600
So,

I think he drove it.

1798
01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:04.830
I flew down and met him and someone comes in and says,

It was what is ecstasy goes,

So we got,

1801
01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:15.390
we're all on ecstasy.

1802
01:48:15.630 --> 01:48:19.320
And we're sitting on a couch with drag him into a Obama and he starts to float

I was in my shitty apartment in new Rochelle,

1808
01:48:40.321 --> 01:48:44.430
New York when I was listen to MTV news.
And they told me that,

Kill him by a 19 year old truck driver who was a fan of his.

I just,

1814
01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:05.910
I didn't think he was capable of dying,
you know.
Oh,

1815
01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.100
wouldn't he still went back to school.

Wow.

But that,

1826
01:49:41.850 --> 01:49:46.200
that's,
that's fantastic.
But you know,
it's funny cause I listened to you,
uh,

1827
01:49:46.201 --> 01:49:49.540
about,
you know,
your work.
I take it you're hanging thing.
We just hang,
you know,

1828
01:49:49.541 --> 01:49:52.870
people doing pull ups and stuff just to hang.
It's great for your shoulders.

1829
01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:54.550
It's great.
It's great for everything.

1830
01:49:54.551 --> 01:49:59.500
But 30 seconds to a minute and stuff like that.
And when I uh,

1831
01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:03.160
I did,
I forgot I was doing a TV show and I saw myself,

1832
01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:07.390
I was 388 pounds or 56 inch ways and I had always been,
you know me,

1833
01:50:07.391 --> 01:50:09.520
what about when I first thought it was the thin kid and everything again?

1834
01:50:09.820 --> 01:50:14.470
And I just,
I,
I was the only guy I know he did coke at an,
at an eating disorder.

1835
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:18.370
I would,
I would do a line and have a steak.
I just,
it was something about,
it was,

1836
01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:23.140
it coke affected me really different than most people.
So I uh,

1837
01:50:23.410 --> 01:50:26.180
I had at the heart problems had all that stuff.
I get,
I got,

1838
01:50:26.230 --> 01:50:31.070
I started to get better and then I,
I,
once I get sold by attorney,

1839
01:50:31.090 --> 01:50:34.360
even water,
food I a bigger and bigger and bigger.
And then one day I just said,

1840
01:50:34.361 --> 01:50:38.200
I'm going to stop.
And then I started,
I went to weight watchers,
you know,

1841
01:50:38.290 --> 01:50:41.680
and I lost like a hundred pounds with them and I thought it was going to be the

1842
01:50:41.681 --> 01:50:44.860
spokesman.
And they ended up giving the job to Charles Barkley.

1843
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:48.370
And then he was talking about fat pitches in San Antonio.

1844
01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:53.260
There's a lot of jobs partly,
but I was the guy,
I mean,
and he put the wet,

1845
01:50:53.261 --> 01:50:56.440
I lost a hundred pounds with them and I was so deep and it all took off.

1846
01:50:56.441 --> 01:50:58.870
And I thought,
I'm definitely,
cause I did Oprah.
I mean I didn't fuck right.

1847
01:50:58.871 --> 01:51:02.260
Did her show.
And I thought that she would like me.
That never happened.

1848
01:51:02.590 --> 01:51:04.360
So I started working on in my own.

1849
01:51:04.361 --> 01:51:09.310
I started riding a bike and I started swimming and I started lifting weights

1850
01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:12.160
because they never lifted in high school.
I was always rail thin.

1851
01:51:12.161 --> 01:51:15.870
I was like [inaudible] 78 pounds in high school.
And then I start getting into,

1852
01:51:15.970 --> 01:51:19.330
I can get to doing sit ups in abs and crunches and,
and then,

1853
01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:23.650
well remember when I met you on the,
but it was a movie.
Here comes the boom.

1854
01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:25.570
You said what happened?
You know,

1855
01:51:26.050 --> 01:51:30.410
and I just in the lifting is,

1856
01:51:30.490 --> 01:51:32.500
was from my brain,
you know,
I mean,
I,

1857
01:51:32.501 --> 01:51:35.890
I'd go to the gym and it was good for my head,
you know,

1858
01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:40.780
and I really liked because I wasn't doing it to look and I was doing it to save

1859
01:51:40.781 --> 01:51:44.080
my life.
And then I started like how I look and I started working at it and it's,

1860
01:51:44.081 --> 01:51:48.370
it's,
it's part of my thing now and I,
you know,
I'm 65 years old,
kids in the gym,

1861
01:51:48.371 --> 01:51:52.600
see me,
how old are you?
I'm 82 you got a six pack medical.
Yeah,

1862
01:51:52.601 --> 01:51:54.430
you can have a toe just,
you know,
eat right.

1863
01:51:54.940 --> 01:51:59.940
But it's just amazing that you went from wild party in constant just drugs and

1864
01:52:00.641 --> 01:52:04.450
booze and partying to 100% healthy.

1865
01:52:04.930 --> 01:52:09.250
Lifting weights on wouldn't be here if he hadn't stopped.
But it's a hard trend.

1866
01:52:09.280 --> 01:52:13.930
That's a hard turn.
That's a big right angle.
Like,
well,
the kid,

1867
01:52:14.290 --> 01:52:18.640
the kid feel bad.
I told you the young,
the bank robber kid was my sponsor.
He,
he,

1868
01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:23.200
he's,
he's,
he said,
listen,
you can get this together.
You can change your life,

1869
01:52:23.201 --> 01:52:27.330
you can,
you know,
the sky's the limit.
And he won't leave me alone.

1870
01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:31.150
He cut the last week,
we've got,
well we've got to meet,
I went to one yesterday,

1871
01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:33.340
go,
she needed another one.
Can't stay clean on yesterday.
Shower.

1872
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:37.470
They probably crazy yesterday.
Shout about that.
So,

1873
01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:40.440
and he just,
he just was,
he was all over me and,

1874
01:52:40.630 --> 01:52:44.860
and I started to get spiritual,
you know,
and,
and,
and did you ever,

1875
01:52:45.730 --> 01:52:48.980
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I'm amazed though.
No,

1876
01:52:48.981 --> 01:52:53.930
I am definitely afraid and I'm not,
and I'm not a,
I'm not a preacher.
You know,

1877
01:52:53.940 --> 01:52:56.210
I don't,
I don't talk about it,
you know,
I mean,

1878
01:52:56.630 --> 01:52:58.790
I'm talking about now because you asked me,
but you know,

1879
01:52:59.030 --> 01:53:03.470
and I don't judge anybody,
you know,
a fuck.
I'll drive you.
Well,
I'll drive.

1880
01:53:03.471 --> 01:53:07.260
You know,
people say if you,
if you break out when you come to my house,

1881
01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:11.640
and I was,
I was insane and I didn't even meet to be,
I didn't know.

1882
01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:14.150
You know what I mean?
And now a lot of this stuff's like,
like,

1883
01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:18.840
like you were saying,
you know,
punch 20 times,
40 times stronger.
I'm going

1884
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:26.440
to miss any of it.
Oh,
I missed it.
I was not,
but you know,
I,

1885
01:53:26.441 --> 01:53:30.710
I can't,
I can't go.
I know how bad I was,
you know,

1886
01:53:30.711 --> 01:53:35.180
and I'm an and I,
and I lost,
I lost a lot,
you know,
I mean,
I'm still working,

1887
01:53:35.210 --> 01:53:38.360
you know what I mean?
And you know,
I mean,
it's,

1888
01:53:39.380 --> 01:53:42.170
it's something I don't want to go back to.
I did it,
you know,
I mean,

1889
01:53:42.440 --> 01:53:44.750
I used to go to play by mission.
It was a playboy mansion all the time.

1890
01:53:45.210 --> 01:53:47.870
They were the high that would have had seven girlfriends,
you know,

1891
01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:50.870
he came up and having a good time.
Lineal,
what am I being goes by?

1892
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:54.703
This woman was,

1893
01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:57.690
his old one was putting a coat on and I went over and helped her to coach.

1894
01:53:57.691 --> 01:53:59.840
Got You.
Nice.
He said what you want me to,
it was,
let me see.

1895
01:53:59.841 --> 01:54:02.510
My son was named money.
It really is.
What do you do?
I'm a comedian.

1896
01:54:02.511 --> 01:54:05.600
My son was a comedian.
I go,
you're not Sally mine.
She goes,
yes,

1897
01:54:05.780 --> 01:54:10.670
it's Sally and me became best of friends.
But she went comics mom,
Lenny Bruce,

1898
01:54:10.671 --> 01:54:15.470
his mom.
Yeah.
And she said,
come get me.
And like,
you know,
horrible story.

1899
01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:19.640
I hadn't,
we would get together twice a week,
you know what I mean?
I just,

1900
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.490
which I certainly Maya Kim and she,
you know,

1901
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:26.180
Lenny would stay a lot of my fucking material.
I'd go to a club and Kennedy says,

1902
01:54:26.181 --> 01:54:28.880
Hey man,
there was a guy in there,
all your materials,
his name Lenny.

1903
01:54:28.881 --> 01:54:32.570
He's my fucking son.
That deep and prep,
you know,
she was really funny.

1904
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:37.520
She was a comma.
She was a Co.
Yeah,
Joan Rivers was doing a movie.
Her life.

1905
01:54:37.850 --> 01:54:42.650
Sally Ma,
you know,
I never saw it,
but I had no idea her son would steal her act.

1906
01:54:42.670 --> 01:54:46.310
Yeah,
yeah.
Great.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1907
01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:52.330
She was at 83 she was raped by some crazy Mexican and broke into a house that,

1908
01:54:55.291 --> 01:54:59.540
and I ran and she goes,
I'm 83 I'm by small fat little juice in.

1909
01:54:59.541 --> 01:55:03.740
This guy's fucking me and I'm going that,
that Shit Dick.

1910
01:55:03.741 --> 01:55:07.460
That's all you've got.
You know,
and she says,
daddy started beating me.
I go,
no,

1911
01:55:07.461 --> 01:55:10.020
you cock sucker.
You,
you're not,
you don't have enough of a god.

1912
01:55:10.030 --> 01:55:12.320
Are you gonna feed me?
I'm an old woman.
And she would,
oh,

1913
01:55:12.321 --> 01:55:17.240
it was all fucking medical Fisher in the hospital.
It was,
it was horrible.

1914
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:19.280
You know what I mean?
It should happen.
You know,

1915
01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:23.290
I remember Sam had her open up his special.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And,

1916
01:55:23.291 --> 01:55:26.460
and we did the thing to raise money for it too,
you know,
cause I mean,
yeah,

1917
01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:31.490
one of his specials,
she,
she actually,
she came out with him,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

1918
01:55:31.670 --> 01:55:36.610
yeah.
Well I had to Sam to her,
cause I had met her at,
at uh,
you know,

1919
01:55:36.611 --> 01:55:40.160
I,
she was the whole point at the playboy mansion.

1920
01:55:40.161 --> 01:55:43.800
She was still on the old woman and have loved it.
And she would go up there

1921
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:48.520
<v 0>and it announced an edge.
We'd sit down,
we'd eat,
and then I drove.</v>

1922
01:55:48.540 --> 01:55:53.490
I drove her everywhere,
you know?
Yeah.
Pretty crazy.
Yeah.
When,
I mean,
I would,

1923
01:55:53.550 --> 01:55:56.360
have you seen that new TV show,
the Marvelous Mrs. Mason though?

1924
01:55:56.370 --> 01:55:58.740
Everyone tells me it's a great show.
It's a great fucking show.

1925
01:55:58.741 --> 01:56:01.740
I mean it's not historically accurate,
like the way they talk.

1926
01:56:02.580 --> 01:56:04.790
It's like they're doing kind of modern stand up,

1927
01:56:05.010 --> 01:56:08.040
but they're doing modern stand up back in those days.

1928
01:56:08.041 --> 01:56:10.380
And the woman that didn't exist,

1929
01:56:10.381 --> 01:56:14.820
like there was no woman like Mrs Maizel historically I get took a long time

1930
01:56:14.821 --> 01:56:15.810
before me.

1931
01:56:15.811 --> 01:56:20.070
She was more rowdy than Lenny Bruce was in the television show.

1932
01:56:20.430 --> 01:56:24.600
But it shows you what it was like back when people were just getting arrested

1933
01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:28.170
for saying things.
Right.
And it makes you realize like Lenny Bruce,

1934
01:56:28.530 --> 01:56:32.940
that fucking guy paid,
he paid the price and we're all benefiting from him.

1935
01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:37.580
Well you know,
when,
when I first started,
uh,

1936
01:56:38.010 --> 01:56:41.470
there was one book,
the last laugh that was otherwise about gambling.

1937
01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:44.730
It was in the movies.
No,
no documentaries,
anything.

1938
01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:50.180
And I wanted to know as much as I could about all the guys who came before me,

1939
01:56:50.670 --> 01:56:51.503
you know,
cause I've watched,

1940
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:55.230
I remember I shot Alan King to stand up on our TV and I'm like,
Oh man,

1941
01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:58.470
it was unbelievable.
H chief,
fantastic.

1942
01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:00.540
Then I shot him is an act of him and he's amazing.

1943
01:57:00.541 --> 01:57:04.310
And I get to work with red buttons,
you know what I mean?
I mean he,

1944
01:57:04.410 --> 01:57:08.820
he wasn't committee,
but it was really funny,
you know,
and I mean the people that,

1945
01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:12.780
that came before me,
I knew every single one of them.
I studied them anyway.

1946
01:57:12.930 --> 01:57:17.550
And this was before youtube and stuff.
I just read whatever I could find on them.

1947
01:57:17.610 --> 01:57:20.510
And it was,
I would tell these young kids coming up,
I go,
yeah,

1948
01:57:20.511 --> 01:57:24.450
I look at the guys who came before you and they're not interested at all.

1949
01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:25.373
You know,
I,

1950
01:57:25.410 --> 01:57:30.210
when I saw a Gleason Gleason was what I wanted to be.

1951
01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:33.520
I just thought Jackie Gleason was just amazing,
you know,
and I,

1952
01:57:33.830 --> 01:57:37.920
I want to be like that guy,
you know?
Cause he was incredible and it was,

1953
01:57:37.921 --> 01:57:39.820
people didn't realize he was a stand up,
you know,

1954
01:57:40.010 --> 01:57:44.260
I didn't even know Gleason did stand.
Oh yeah.
Really one night,
two ton.

1955
01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:49.200
Tony Polenta was giving him shit and the boxer and Gleason heckled them and

1956
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:54.300
totally not them out.
Yeah.
Oh yeah,
it was,
it was incredible.

1957
01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:58.170
You know,
cause I met Art Carney,
you know,
Jackie Gleason was obsessed with Ufos.

1958
01:57:58.650 --> 01:58:03.360
Did you know that?
No,
but I,
I kinda dig it too,
man.
That's a story.
This,

1959
01:58:03.361 --> 01:58:05.840
this guy told it to me.
Some guy was or,

1960
01:58:05.970 --> 01:58:10.590
or a rock band dude.
He told me the story,

1961
01:58:10.591 --> 01:58:11.550
and I don't know if it's true,

1962
01:58:11.790 --> 01:58:16.510
but the story was that Gleason was friends with Nixon and Nixon said,

1963
01:58:16.511 --> 01:58:20.820
do you want to see some shit?
Nixon took him to worry of 51.
It was,

1964
01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:23.730
I don't think it was area 51,
I think it was hanger 18,

1965
01:58:23.731 --> 01:58:28.380
which is in the air force base and I think it was outside of Columbus,
Ohio.

1966
01:58:28.381 --> 01:58:33.381
And they supposedly had some fucking crashed UFO there and Gleason built a

1967
01:58:34.381 --> 01:58:38.820
replica of it or how to wrap a club that bill in his fucking backyard in New

1968
01:58:38.820 --> 01:58:42.220
York.
Wow.
Homestead air force base

1969
01:58:42.220 --> 01:58:45.720
<v 2>outside of Miami.
It says,
oh wow.
There you go.
Yeah.
Beautiful.
Yeah,</v>

1970
01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:49.960
I got a bullshit version of it will pull up the,
um,
the actual version.

1971
01:58:49.961 --> 01:58:53.020
Where are you getting this from?
I just Google it.
I mean,
it's a cup.

1972
01:58:53.230 --> 01:58:56.860
It's a rumored story.
So I don't know.
That's how I got,

1973
01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:59.710
I got it from a guy in a band might be bullshit,

1974
01:58:59.711 --> 01:59:02.320
but he gave me some book on Ufos and he was telling me about this.
And,

1975
01:59:02.321 --> 01:59:05.820
but the Jackie Gleason apparent who was obsessed with Ufo.
Yes.
Well,
I,

1976
01:59:05.930 --> 01:59:10.270
I believe this.
There's gotta be something out there.
I don't w w we're it.

1977
01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:14.650
I mean that's it.
No,
I don't believe we're ever,
I did a lot of,
uh,

1978
01:59:14.690 --> 01:59:19.630
Uso shows and I've been around the world then,
and I was,
every time I've done,

1979
01:59:19.631 --> 01:59:20.464
I was in,

1980
01:59:21.100 --> 01:59:26.100
off the coast of Turkey someplace in the commander based took me out for dinner

1981
01:59:26.321 --> 01:59:29.530
afterwards and I got drunk.
I got a pretty truck.

1982
01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:32.440
I was so busy with am I going pretty deck?
And I said,
hey man,
he goes,

1983
01:59:32.441 --> 01:59:34.900
let me ask you about,
uh,
area 51.
He goes,

1984
01:59:35.250 --> 01:59:40.120
he got stone soul because this conversation never happened.
And he left.

1985
01:59:40.210 --> 01:59:43.480
And I had to take a cab to find my way back to a new page that,

1986
01:59:43.540 --> 01:59:48.070
that no one knows about it.
Right.
So then we're,
uh,
uh,
I'm in,

1987
01:59:48.130 --> 01:59:48.963
I'm at the dunes,

1988
01:59:48.970 --> 01:59:53.670
this how long ago that was and I'm with these guys who are in the air force and

1989
01:59:54.130 --> 01:59:56.950
they said,
man,
we really like to show with Fangio was,
and I got him drunk,

1990
01:59:57.220 --> 02:00:01.790
I should say,
man,
what about uh,
area 51?
And they said,
Mr Goodnight.

1991
02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:04.630
And they walked away.
So now me and Mike,
uh,

1992
02:00:04.631 --> 02:00:08.830
golf and with these blue angels and he goes,
you're going to ask them?
I go,
no.

1993
02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:10.510
The second year we golf with them again.
I go,

1994
02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:15.540
I fellas tell me about every 50 1:00 AM well,

1995
02:00:16.630 --> 02:00:17.463
he goes,

1996
02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:22.300
I was flying a plane and I had malfunctioning high land there and they came out

1997
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:25.810
and they pretty much blind fault to me.

1998
02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:31.060
It took me into a building and they fixed my jet within 35 minutes and then put

1999
02:00:32.340 --> 02:00:35.410
it back to them and say,
you wouldn't never here.
And I went,
oh my God.

2000
02:00:35.530 --> 02:00:38.350
So I don't know what's out there.
Yeah,
but was,
here's the thing,

2001
02:00:38.530 --> 02:00:42.670
that was an area where they were testing all sorts of military equipment.

2002
02:00:42.910 --> 02:00:44.950
They were testing different new,

2003
02:00:45.290 --> 02:00:48.130
that's where the beat two or the stealth bomber,

2004
02:00:49.100 --> 02:00:51.730
they were testing that there and and the,
and the spy plane,

2005
02:00:52.070 --> 02:00:53.330
they were testing a lot of shit.
Yeah.

2006
02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:57.100
So there was a lot of top secret stuff there didn't necessarily have be dealing

2007
02:00:57.110 --> 02:01:01.620
with.
I understand that and I'm hoping that the risk,
but he's,

2008
02:01:01.621 --> 02:01:05.080
but I will try to find out,
but I'd love to go to a man.
Oh Man.

2009
02:01:05.110 --> 02:01:07.390
But you can't even drive if you drive up there Joe.

2010
02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:10.000
But the time you get your camera out there,

2011
02:01:10.030 --> 02:01:13.330
they're on tell you what you get out of here,
we'll lock you up.
You know,
it's,

2012
02:01:13.331 --> 02:01:18.010
it's not good.
So they don't even go there anymore.
They've moved to a new area.

2013
02:01:18.370 --> 02:01:19.240
They've actually,

2014
02:01:19.241 --> 02:01:23.710
because it's so heavily scrutinized because of Google earth and all sorts of

2015
02:01:23.711 --> 02:01:27.310
different ways you can see things.
They've actually moved to another area I read,

2016
02:01:27.311 --> 02:01:30.100
I read everything I could find about that too.
And I think,

2017
02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:35.580
I think I read the book Area 51 cup two years ago and basically at the end of

2018
02:01:35.771 --> 02:01:38.440
the book it was like Hitler had these,
you know,

2019
02:01:38.560 --> 02:01:41.930
his experimented with the Jews and cut,

2020
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:44.570
put their arms on different ways and had a,

2021
02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:49.670
had an aircraft that was looked like a spaceship and it crashed and he's,

2022
02:01:49.671 --> 02:01:53.610
people came up with them crazy arms,
but there are aliens and that,

2023
02:01:53.630 --> 02:01:56.190
that was in the book,
you know,
so I can shut the shit out.

2024
02:01:56.330 --> 02:02:01.330
<v 1>I know the Hitler d did experiment with some sort of disc type air vehicle.</v>

2025
02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:02.920
Yeah,
they did.

2026
02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:06.430
I don't know if they ever got it off the ground or what the deal was,
but um,

2027
02:02:06.590 --> 02:02:10.790
the most interesting stories,
the story of Robert Lasar,
Bob Lasar,

2028
02:02:10.791 --> 02:02:14.540
who was a guy who worked at area 51 and he got fired because his wife was

2029
02:02:14.541 --> 02:02:19.040
cheating on him and they were a recording all of his phone calls and taping all

2030
02:02:19.041 --> 02:02:21.290
of these conversations.
And they found out that his wife was cheating on him.

2031
02:02:21.291 --> 02:02:23.270
They thought that he was going to be emotionally unstable.

2032
02:02:23.510 --> 02:02:25.640
And so they didn't tell him why they just released him.

2033
02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:28.490
So then he brings friends to watch these,

2034
02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:33.300
what he said was we're alien crafts that they were experimenting with and they

2035
02:02:33.301 --> 02:02:35.480
were flying these things around that had some,

2036
02:02:35.890 --> 02:02:40.040
it's super advanced propulsion system that they were asking him to help back

2037
02:02:40.041 --> 02:02:41.540
engineer.
And he brought friends,
do that.

2038
02:02:41.541 --> 02:02:44.360
And then they got arrested for doing that.
And when he did that,

2039
02:02:44.361 --> 02:02:48.110
then he started talking about it.
So He's been discredited by a bunch of people.

2040
02:02:48.111 --> 02:02:51.380
But I don't know who's telling the truth.
He says that,
you know,
they uh,

2041
02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:54.350
they wiped his,
uh,
college record so that no one,

2042
02:02:54.380 --> 02:02:58.010
but people said they went to school with them and he definitely did work for the

2043
02:02:58.011 --> 02:03:00.260
government.
But under what capacity,
who knows?

2044
02:03:00.261 --> 02:03:04.460
But his story is fascinating and you know,
I want it to be true.
You hear it.

2045
02:03:04.461 --> 02:03:05.160
You'll want it to be

2046
02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:05.900
<v 2>Joe.</v>

2047
02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:10.900
They used to fly the team of people that worked at area 51 from Burbank.

2048
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:16.160
Yeah.
Every day.
Fly Him in,
they'd work and then fly back.

2049
02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:18.080
Like they didn't stay over.

2050
02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:21.210
<v 1>Well there was at one airport outside of Vegas,
so it was right outside like the,</v>

2051
02:03:21.211 --> 02:03:22.680
where the Riviera was.
Yeah.

2052
02:03:22.681 --> 02:03:26.760
You can actually look out and see the airport and they would fly them,

2053
02:03:26.790 --> 02:03:28.360
the people from there.
And then mark jet.

2054
02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:32.350
<v 2>Yeah.
I want it to be sure.
Of course.
Yeah.
You want it to be true.</v>

2055
02:03:33.610 --> 02:03:38.580
We flew up,
we,
we did Guantanamo Bay and,
Oh wow.

2056
02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:42.580
You didn't stand up there.
Yeah.
The fuck is that.
It was amazing.

2057
02:03:42.581 --> 02:03:45.850
I was like Colin Quinn,
Greg Giraldo,
uh,

2058
02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:48.280
who's the little kid on billions,
uh,

2059
02:03:48.310 --> 02:03:53.170
Mike Birbiglia and Gaffigan,
Jim Gaffigan and someone else.
I know.

2060
02:03:53.560 --> 02:03:58.180
We flew in like a CIA play and we did the show.

2061
02:03:58.570 --> 02:04:02.320
She's a striker.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was pretty,
pretty amazing.
And uh,

2062
02:04:02.650 --> 02:04:06.550
I tailored my show to the marines that were there and he's a young guy and

2063
02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:07.870
during the week they said,

2064
02:04:08.020 --> 02:04:11.110
Mrs. Cochran really lifted the morale of everyone is just a,

2065
02:04:11.590 --> 02:04:14.660
what do you want to do?
I said,
I want to go over and taught you the presidents,

2066
02:04:14.690 --> 02:04:19.360
you know,
not actually to touch scream with them
all.
We can't have that,
you know,

2067
02:04:19.590 --> 02:04:21.010
I did.
But anyway,

2068
02:04:21.430 --> 02:04:26.430
we do the show and we'll leave in like three days later and I get to the airport

2069
02:04:26.890 --> 02:04:30.850
first one day and I see this little HC to plane and I go,
uh,
to,

2070
02:04:31.120 --> 02:04:34.620
to Spanish.
Bigger guys go Ponyo nobody,
nobody.

2071
02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:40.030
So I go into the gift shop and I buy a giant,
like a water thing so I can,

2072
02:04:40.170 --> 02:04:42.710
I can piss in it.
And the guy shop who wants Biz.

2073
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:46.950
So funny.
That's great.
That's great.
Yeah.

2074
02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:50.910
We got on a plane and we fly.
It only took us like an hour to fly in.

2075
02:04:50.970 --> 02:04:52.920
This was a four hour flight in an eight,

2076
02:04:53.010 --> 02:04:57.960
a two engine HCD over water the whole way and about 15 minutes or hey man,

2077
02:04:57.961 --> 02:05:00.040
where's the bathroom?
You have no bond.
You know what?

2078
02:05:01.370 --> 02:05:05.490
By the time we hit Miami,
these guys,
well person at the top of the stairs,

2079
02:05:05.491 --> 02:05:10.260
it was so fun.
Yeah.
I was in favor then,

2080
02:05:10.650 --> 02:05:14.580
but it was,
uh,
it was tangible.
Bay was amazing.
That's gotta be very weird.

2081
02:05:14.610 --> 02:05:18.780
It was in that place.
What year was this?
Oh Shit,
it's post nine 11,
obviously.

2082
02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:23.880
Yeah.
Yeah,
because I said to them,
I said,
well,
can,

2083
02:05:24.210 --> 02:05:27.630
can we ride horses and no more horses.
They had horseback riding.

2084
02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:29.950
They had beautiful beaches for our troops.
That was,

2085
02:05:30.150 --> 02:05:33.660
and I could see sailfish breaking.
And I said,
can we go fishing?
You know,

2086
02:05:33.661 --> 02:05:36.500
I've never caught,
no,
we can't.
We can't go out.
And they said,

2087
02:05:36.501 --> 02:05:38.550
we'll give you a ride and a gun boat.
I want an a gun boat.
And I said,

2088
02:05:38.551 --> 02:05:41.130
what do you think?
Is it my wife boats faster?
You know,
you'll be honest with you.

2089
02:05:41.530 --> 02:05:45.900
It was a nice,
but my white book champs.
So then the golf,

2090
02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:48.840
he had a carry your mat and hit off the mat.

2091
02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:53.430
It's all been run into disrepair,
but it's still beautiful.

2092
02:05:53.610 --> 02:05:55.170
And because I did TV and movies,

2093
02:05:55.171 --> 02:05:59.400
I was like a gs 13 and I got the best apartment overlooking the bay.

2094
02:05:59.730 --> 02:06:04.460
And that bay is so big,
you can fit an entire battle fleet with the,

2095
02:06:04.770 --> 02:06:09.360
uh,
with the battleship and,
uh,
destroys everything that goes with it,

2096
02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:11.880
right in the bay and all it was in,
it was like a robot.
I mean,

2097
02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:16.650
the tanks are gone and so they should,
you want to go ride the fence?
I said,
yeah.

2098
02:06:16.651 --> 02:06:20.130
Yeah.
So we'd get up in the tower and I see,
I get the binoculars,

2099
02:06:20.131 --> 02:06:23.040
I see just Cuban gag.
So I give him the finger.
We go,
no,
no,
what's,

2100
02:06:23.041 --> 02:06:26.460
the clock is not an international incident.
And the guys comes out of you guys.

2101
02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:30.300
I'm sorry.
Sorry,
I didn't mean it didn't go.
We got it.
I said,
well,

2102
02:06:30.301 --> 02:06:33.480
why were you so nervous?
He goes,
this millions of Cubans here,

2103
02:06:33.481 --> 02:06:36.750
they could overwhelm us.
And I go,
really?
And I go,
well,
why don't we have no,

2104
02:06:36.751 --> 02:06:40.500
we have a skeleton for us now that if they want it to overtake,
I said,

2105
02:06:40.501 --> 02:06:41.910
we could call it an air strike.
I said,

2106
02:06:41.911 --> 02:06:44.040
I don't would that take and to go about 20 minutes,
you know,

2107
02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:47.880
they'd Jetson Camada wherever they could totally out of Florida.

2108
02:06:48.510 --> 02:06:52.750
So they,
I said,
they're commander goes,
if you do anything you want,
I said,

2109
02:06:52.751 --> 02:06:55.770
I'd like to go into Havana mean by some tough guys,
you know,
take the sheet.

2110
02:06:55.771 --> 02:06:59.100
The Guy said,
some bitch come in my office,
we go in and there's a map.
He goes,

2111
02:06:59.110 --> 02:07:02.010
see this this way?
You are.
He goes,
that's where Havana,

2112
02:07:02.460 --> 02:07:04.710
Cuba is the biggest island in the Caribbean.

2113
02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:08.070
I had no 736 miles from Havana.
He said,

2114
02:07:08.071 --> 02:07:11.220
you were closer to end and when you went in Miami.
And I went,
Whoa,
God.
Yeah,

2115
02:07:11.221 --> 02:07:14.550
I didn't know that,
you know,
but,
but the guys were great.
It was a,

2116
02:07:14.551 --> 02:07:18.890
it was a great show.
They put her on TV,
like,
I forget what's spot,
man.

2117
02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:23.720
Youtube someplace sucked.
They wouldn't let you go fishing.
Oh,
it sucks.
I want to,

2118
02:07:23.730 --> 02:07:26.730
I want it to ride a horse.
I wanted to ride the tankers.

2119
02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:29.770
You see all the tank tracks from when it went up over the mountains,
you know,

2120
02:07:30.090 --> 02:07:35.010
and they had taken the,
uh,
the prisoners and they taken from,

2121
02:07:35.050 --> 02:07:36.010
uh,
uh,

2122
02:07:36.150 --> 02:07:41.150
Camp X-ray to Camp Delta because can't batch was basically like dog cages.

2123
02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:44.560
And CNN came down,
look,
I what trading is pip.

2124
02:07:44.561 --> 02:07:47.500
I mean over there overlooking the fact that they blew up the world trade center,

2125
02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:50.140
but you know,
so now they're in,
they ever,

2126
02:07:50.290 --> 02:07:54.640
they're better quarters then some of the marines that have gotten them out of

2127
02:07:54.680 --> 02:07:58.110
the supposedly and still do have a lot of innocent people in there.

2128
02:07:58.220 --> 02:08:01.870
There was a lot of people that they just scooped up in the wide net of looking

2129
02:08:01.871 --> 02:08:05.530
to find people that were complicit or people that were working with isis or al

2130
02:08:05.530 --> 02:08:08.290
Qaeda.
I mean,
I wasn't able to grab them,
but you know,

2131
02:08:08.291 --> 02:08:12.910
but there was some bad guys.
It's too,
yeah.
Yeah.
It's a real bad guy.
When,
when,

2132
02:08:12.940 --> 02:08:17.200
uh,
Obama released the five guys to,

2133
02:08:17.950 --> 02:08:22.560
for that one guy deserve.
It does.
Yeah.
It,
uh,
uh,

2134
02:08:22.570 --> 02:08:23.930
one of my buddies into sales is long.

2135
02:08:23.940 --> 02:08:26.500
I put three of those guys in there and that,
the bad guys,

2136
02:08:26.501 --> 02:08:30.130
it shouldn't be let out.
You know,
who knows?
I mean,
yeah.

2137
02:08:30.131 --> 02:08:31.660
It's got to be strange though to be in.

2138
02:08:31.661 --> 02:08:35.530
That doesn't mean that is like one of the most famous prisons in the world.

2139
02:08:35.531 --> 02:08:38.680
And you're doing stand up there.
Oh it was,
it was unbelievable.
I mean,

2140
02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:41.740
which I really liked it.
Uh,

2141
02:08:41.860 --> 02:08:45.970
Castro has never cashed a check.
It's 5,000 a year.

2142
02:08:46.630 --> 02:08:49.360
We pay him 5,000 here for that,

2143
02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:53.320
the Guantanamo Bay and he never cashed a check.

2144
02:08:54.010 --> 02:08:57.220
Hey cause she figured if he didn't cash it and we could get support,

2145
02:08:57.221 --> 02:09:01.450
he could get out of the deal.
But that was the deal made like what fit and Joe,

2146
02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:06.360
it was so,
it was so beautiful.
Like they used to have fire pits and,

2147
02:09:06.650 --> 02:09:10.930
and um,
uh,
beautiful things to shade the,
you know,

2148
02:09:10.931 --> 02:09:15.490
the families and the beaches.
A pristine,
but a lot of go to hell.

2149
02:09:15.700 --> 02:09:17.440
Yeah.
That's so strange.
Yeah.

2150
02:09:18.030 --> 02:09:20.610
