00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did it humble you?</v>

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Like in what way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I realized that</v>

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.720
<v Speaker 1>when we were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see when,</v>

4
00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:13.990
<v Speaker 1>when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I film a documentary and I'm soften</v>

5
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I film a documentary called when they</v>

6
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>grow in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Cape Verde two years ago.</v>

7
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Negro?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Iguana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean black water events in</v>

9
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese and then we were there for</v>
<v Speaker 1>about five weeks,</v>

10
00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>five or six weeks and then the living</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions were really bad</v>

11
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>and there was no grocery stores around</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had to catch my own food and it</v>

12
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>was really a self sufficient type of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chip.</v>

13
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 1>In the first week I remember the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing I could focus on was,</v>

14
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is.</v>

15
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.670
<v Speaker 1>This is terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The we don't have a shower.</v>

16
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:53.610
<v Speaker 1>There's no hot water and bathrooms are</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgusting.</v>

17
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm starving is nothing around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all you can thing is like how</v>

18
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>you comfort is gone and after a week</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the.</v>

19
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>The focus changed on the good things I</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing around us and why having</v>

20
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.280
<v Speaker 1>nothing all of a sudden then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

21
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.360
<v Speaker 1>I actually now for the first time in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life can take the time to realize what's</v>

22
00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:22.660
<v Speaker 1>good around me and then how we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>having fires with the neighbors and then</v>

23
00:01:22.661 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>how we were offering and fish and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

24
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:25.361
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:28.450
<v Speaker 1>if I give this guy to fish is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat one today and then one tomorrow.</v>

26
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inviting neighbors to share when</v>

27
00:01:31.751 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Speaker 1>they make sure that it was like a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like community sends to all of it and I</v>

28
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:36.161
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

29
00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I've been living in London for six</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

30
00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:39.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know the name of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor.</v>

31
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.201
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

32
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:41.951
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bad.</v>

33
00:01:41.951 --> 00:01:43.990
<v Speaker 1>It's just not a way of living that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

34
00:01:43.991 --> 00:01:45.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not focusing in a right thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

35
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.060
<v Speaker 1>it was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's in that way,</v>

36
00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:52.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's realized how much of how much of an</v>

37
00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:55.870
<v Speaker 1>asshole we actually became and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to do that.</v>

38
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 2>The moment the cameras went off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle walkie twists that a spoon and</v>

39
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 2>started getting it to twist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The producer had a complete mental</v>

40
00:02:04.901 --> 00:02:05.531
<v Speaker 2>breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

41
00:02:05.531 --> 00:02:07.210
<v Speaker 2>up to this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just thinking this is tricks,</v>

42
00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:07.990
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

43
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.620
<v Speaker 2>it's not that big of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He starts screaming,</v>

44
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.690
<v Speaker 2>yelling that rain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's evil,</v>

45
00:02:13.691 --> 00:02:16.150
<v Speaker 2>should never have listened to randy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He woulda got this on tape.</v>

46
00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:20.590
<v Speaker 2>If it wasn't for Randy and he looks down</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's got a wet spot on the front of</v>

47
00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 2>his pants and he looks down and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had a demonic ejaculation,</v>

48
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.490
<v Speaker 2>like literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's having a mental breakdown.</v>

49
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 2>I go and I have to spend the night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was not a bad thing.</v>

50
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:34.090
<v Speaker 2>She was quite pleasant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

51
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.070
<v Speaker 2>to look at his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his assistant.</v>

52
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.700
<v Speaker 2>I had to spend the night with her in her</v>
<v Speaker 2>room because randy was calling her.</v>

53
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not randy.</v>

54
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.193
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

55
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony editable calling her.</v>

56
00:02:42.731 --> 00:02:46.750
<v Speaker 2>The producer was calling her</v>
<v Speaker 2>consistently screaming and yelling about</v>

57
00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:50.830
<v Speaker 2>randy and this scared the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't just gloss over the fact that</v>

58
00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:52.960
<v Speaker 2>guy just noted in his pants and he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling,</v>

59
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Speaker 2>you're just to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a mental.</v>

60
00:02:54.401 --> 00:02:58.360
<v Speaker 2>It's a mental breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Orgasm in your pants during a mental</v>

61
00:02:58.361 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 2>breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't it.</v>

62
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 2>He did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should document that.</v>

63
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 2>That's more impressive than spending a</v>
<v Speaker 2>spoon.</v>

64
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 2>I should've said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

65
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 2>that's my psychic ability working right</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

66
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

67
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tells you this as an ejaculation</v>

68
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 2>pants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He in front of everybody.</v>

69
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:16.590
<v Speaker 2>He says it's a demonic ejaculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>East straight up says I.</v>

70
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 2>The Arctic ejaculation seems like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>together guy with definitely got a head</v>

71
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.930
<v Speaker 2>on his shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a producer for,</v>

72
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 2>I think it was BBC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not mistaken.</v>

73
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 2>He was doing a documentary for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah.</v>

74
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fucking crazy.</v>

75
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He finished.</v>

76
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 2>He finished a documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

77
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

78
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>

79
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.680
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as he finished.</v>

80
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.950
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

81
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.500
<v Speaker 2>he believed in psychic phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also believed that a demon made them</v>

82
00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 2>come in his pants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>

83
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.820
<v Speaker 3>How are we going to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cowboy?</v>

84
00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:46.821
<v Speaker 3>What are we going to do short RBC up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I run out of air,</v>

85
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm now thinking in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how am I going to die?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm sucking air and I'm fucking</v>

144
00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.930
<v Speaker 3>that was the feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

145
00:06:28.931 --> 00:06:31.960
<v Speaker 3>my guys out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't be mad at him because he</v>

146
00:06:31.961 --> 00:06:33.160
<v Speaker 3>panicked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He grabbed the line,</v>

147
00:06:33.161 --> 00:06:38.161
<v Speaker 3>he fucking ran out the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks at me and he says,</v>

148
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.873
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

149
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.890
<v Speaker 3>so we're not diving together ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

150
00:06:46.891 --> 00:06:47.880
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was it.</v>

151
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.910
<v Speaker 3>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I texted my girl,</v>

152
00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.570
<v Speaker 3>I love you baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

153
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.120
<v Speaker 3>there was a fucking scary moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but daddy's coming home.</v>

154
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 1>What is it like to have Jordan Peterson</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a dad?</v>

155
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Is it weird?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to check yourself</v>

156
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>constantly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you're on,</v>

157
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 1>on steady ground?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd say anything ridiculous.</v>

158
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

159
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize it was weird until I</v>

160
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:14.790
<v Speaker 1>went away to university and then kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>style.</v>

161
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.320
<v Speaker 1>I was away for awhile and then when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>came back to the house,</v>

162
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:21.900
<v Speaker 1>especially because the house was full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like paintings and masks and statues and</v>

163
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 1>like 32 different paint colors and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>came back and was like,</v>

164
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.170
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's a bit eccentric.</v>

165
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely eccentric.</v>

166
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking off air about what it</v>

167
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:39.161
<v Speaker 1>was like to watch your dad become famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>and become famous in his fifties,</v>

168
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:40.364
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

169
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>54,</v>

170
00:07:42.081 --> 00:07:44.660
<v Speaker 1>55.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when it became famous before that</v>

171
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.570
<v Speaker 1>relatively unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respected professor.</v>

172
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.830
<v Speaker 1>One issue with this one transgender bill</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the the,</v>

173
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:56.831
<v Speaker 1>the preferred pronouns bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then boom off to the races.</v>

174
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's strange.</v>

175
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

176
00:08:00.291 --> 00:08:03.530
<v Speaker 1>It was super weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially how the media was portraying</v>

177
00:08:03.531 --> 00:08:07.520
<v Speaker 1>him and how what was actually happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the events wasn't what was being</v>

178
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:10.390
<v Speaker 1>portrayed in the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was weird to watch and then</v>

179
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 1>people recognizing him on the street is</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>

180
00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.460
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

181
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.510
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say what,</v>

182
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>what happened in real life was not what</v>
<v Speaker 1>was being portrayed like what was</v>

183
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:22.100
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly what he was saying.</v>

184
00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:24.860
<v Speaker 1>So most of what he said is on film</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

185
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.520
<v Speaker 1>so you can go to youtube and see what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been saying like not there's not</v>

186
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.640
<v Speaker 1>like some secret that's going around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's been portrayed has been so</v>

187
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:35.630
<v Speaker 1>much more negative than what he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually said.</v>

188
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Or they'll take like sound bites and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just weave a story that isn't quite</v>

189
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:42.410
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I didn't read it for some reason.</v>

190
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:45.710
<v Speaker 1>I now it looks silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for some reason I just thought that</v>

191
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:47.600
<v Speaker 1>what the media was portraying was</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest.</v>

192
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.690
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

193
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:50.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me Too.</v>

194
00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

195
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.140
<v Speaker 1>And it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trapped in there and they can't</v>

196
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.020
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out.</v>

197
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have an</v>

198
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 2>option to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see them.</v>

199
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.910
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the different spins though.</v>

200
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
<v Speaker 2>All the different women's spins in w.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One one really bizarre spin that I saw</v>

201
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 2>was this one was saying that this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>indicative of the problem of all comedy</v>

202
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:15.351
<v Speaker 2>clubs and aggressive male audience and</v>
<v Speaker 2>women sitting there feeling threatened,</v>

203
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.030
<v Speaker 2>not being able to use their voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like user voice.</v>

204
00:09:19.031 --> 00:09:21.730
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you gonna heckle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were saying like you like you would</v>

205
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.430
<v Speaker 2>be more empowered if there were more</v>
<v Speaker 2>women so you could heckle is.</v>

206
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.810
<v Speaker 2>That's not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not supposed to do that at a</v>

207
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 2>comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you.</v>

208
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Don't like someone just don't laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like one's,</v>

209
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.560
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not your job or it's not your place</v>

210
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.190
<v Speaker 2>to say that you don't like someone when</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other people do like it.</v>

211
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.400
<v Speaker 2>You know if you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to get up and walk out.</v>

212
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like you're going to see a movie.</v>

213
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Like you're an audience member,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

214
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 2>The deal is you're not there to perform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the audience is there to just sit there</v>

215
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:55.980
<v Speaker 2>and laugh or not laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't be rude to the other people</v>

216
00:09:55.981 --> 00:09:58.290
<v Speaker 2>that are enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as you break your</v>

217
00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:01.030
<v Speaker 2>sensibilities above,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the audience will.</v>

218
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.260
<v Speaker 2>You are a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

219
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.080
<v Speaker 2>You've made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you decide like,</v>

220
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:04.930
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't like this,</v>

221
00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:07.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go home and write about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's totally your prerogative.</v>

222
00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:08.700
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get up and walk out.</v>

223
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.050
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go somewhere else and talk about it on</v>

224
00:10:11.051 --> 00:10:13.830
<v Speaker 2>stage yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing wrong with any of those things,</v>

225
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.250
<v Speaker 2>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one woman's take was like,</v>

226
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.490
<v Speaker 2>women don't feel like they have a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can.</v>

227
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.690
<v Speaker 2>They have the ability to speak out about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

228
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak out like so you're saying like to</v>

229
00:10:23.611 --> 00:10:24.241
<v Speaker 2>heckle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

230
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you on stage.</v>

231
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.070
<v Speaker 2>I know everything about you and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
