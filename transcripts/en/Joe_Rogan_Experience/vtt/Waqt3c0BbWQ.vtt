00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.030
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did it humble you?</v>

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Like in what way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I realized that</v>

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 1>when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say when I'm,</v>

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.110
<v Speaker 1>when I film a documentary and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I from a documentary called [inaudible]</v>

6
00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Negra and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Cape Verde two years ago.</v>

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Aqua Negro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Iguana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that mean black water?</v>

9
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.753
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Portuguese.</v>

10
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.510
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>we were there for about five weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five or six weeks.</v>

12
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>And then the living conditions were</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty bad</v>

13
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.960
<v Speaker 1>and there was no grocery stores around</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had to catch my own food.</v>

14
00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>And then it was really a self sufficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>type of chip.</v>

15
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>In the first week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember the only thing I could focus</v>

16
00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>on was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh God,</v>

17
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is terrible.</v>

18
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't have a showered is no hot</v>

20
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm starving is nothing around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all you can thing is like,</v>

00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>how will you comfort is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after week,</v>

22
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

23
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>the focus change on the good things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing around us and why having</v>

24
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.280
<v Speaker 1>nothing all of a sudden then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

25
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I actually now for the first time in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life can take the time to realize what's</v>

26
00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:22.660
<v Speaker 1>good around me and then how we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>having fires with the neighbors and then</v>

27
00:01:22.661 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>how we were offering and fish and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>were thinking,</v>

28
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.361
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>eat one today and one tomorrow.</v>

30
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inviting the neighbors to share when</v>

31
00:01:31.751 --> 00:01:34.540
<v Speaker 1>they made sure that it was like a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>like community sentence to all of it.</v>

32
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.160
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

33
00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:37.630
<v Speaker 1>I've been living in London for six</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

34
00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know the name of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor.</v>

35
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.181
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

37
00:01:41.951 --> 00:01:43.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a way of living that I want.</v>

38
00:01:43.991 --> 00:01:45.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not focusing in the right thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

39
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.060
<v Speaker 1>it was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's in that way,</v>

40
00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:50.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's realize how much of,</v>

41
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.720
<v Speaker 1>how much of an asshole we actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>became and I just didn't want to do</v>

42
00:01:55.721 --> 00:01:56.554
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

43
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.760
<v Speaker 2>The moment the cameras went off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Masa waukee twisted a spoon and started</v>

44
00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 2>getting it to twist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The producer had a complete mental</v>

45
00:02:04.901 --> 00:02:05.531
<v Speaker 2>breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

46
00:02:05.531 --> 00:02:06.610
<v Speaker 2>up to this point,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's not that big of a deal.</v>

49
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.290
<v Speaker 2>He starts screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yelling that randy's evil should never</v>

50
00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:16.360
<v Speaker 2>have listened to randy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would've got this on tape if it</v>

51
00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:19.600
<v Speaker 2>wasn't for Randy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he looks down and he's got a wet</v>

52
00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:22.540
<v Speaker 2>spot on the front of his pants and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks down and he says,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I just had a demonic ejaculations like</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I go and I have to spend the night,</v>

55
00:02:30.881 --> 00:02:35.170
<v Speaker 2>which was not a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was quite pleasant to look at his,</v>

56
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.960
<v Speaker 2>his assistant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to spend the night with her in her</v>

57
00:02:37.961 --> 00:02:40.360
<v Speaker 2>room because randy was calling her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not randy.</v>

58
00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:41.194
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

61
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.240
<v Speaker 2>fuck up.</v>

62
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.170
<v Speaker 2>You can't just gloss over the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy just nutted in his pants.</v>

63
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.600
<v Speaker 2>He was yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just gonna.</v>

64
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.450
<v Speaker 2>He had a med.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a mental breakdown.</v>

65
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a hot orgasm and your pants</v>

66
00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 2>during a mental note.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't it.</v>

67
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 2>He did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should document that.</v>

68
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 2>That's more impressive than banging a</v>
<v Speaker 2>spoon.</v>

69
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 2>I should have said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 2>That's my psychic ability working right</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

71
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make any sense.</v>

72
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he tells you he has an a jackie in his</v>

<v Speaker 2>he says it's a demonic ejaculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He straight up says,</v>

75
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:19.190
<v Speaker 2>I am the Arctic ejaculations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seems like a together guy with</v>

76
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 2>definitely got a head on his shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a producer for us.</v>

77
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:23.970
<v Speaker 2>I think it was BBC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not mistaken.</v>

78
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 2>He was doing a documentary for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It wasn't crazy then.</v>

83
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 2>As long as you finish this documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

84
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>he believed in psychic phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also believed the demon made him come</v>

85
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 2>in his pants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>

86
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.450
<v Speaker 3>How are we going to do this calorie?</v>

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.830
<v Speaker 3>We filled our BC up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I run out of air,</v>

88
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.950

162
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.800
<v Speaker 1>What is it like to have Jordan Peterson</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a dad.</v>

163
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Is it weird?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to check yourself</v>

164
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 1>constantly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you're on,</v>

165
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.490
<v Speaker 1>on steady ground?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd say anything ridiculous.</v>

166
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:08.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

167
00:07:08.691 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>None at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't realize it was weird until I</v>

168
00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:16.031
<v Speaker 1>went away to university and then kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw like just when I was away for a</v>

169
00:07:16.111 --> 00:07:18.320
<v Speaker 1>while and then when I came back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

170
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:21.920
<v Speaker 1>especially because the house was full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like paintings and masks and statues and</v>

171
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 1>like 32 different paint colors and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>came back and was like,</v>

172
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:27.170
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he's a bit eccentric.</v>

173
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.740
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's definitely eccentric.</v>

174
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking off air about what it</v>

175
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:36.590
<v Speaker 1>was like to watch your dad to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous and,</v>

176
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:39.500
<v Speaker 1>and become famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in his 50s,</v>

177
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:40.334
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

178
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope 54 55 that's when he became</v>

179
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:46.340
<v Speaker 1>famous before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relatively unknown,</v>

180
00:07:46.341 --> 00:07:50.390
<v Speaker 1>respected professor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One issue with this one transgender</v>

181
00:07:50.391 --> 00:07:51.700
<v Speaker 1>bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

182
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 1>the preferred pronouns bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then boom,</v>

183
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 1>off to the races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

184
00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.540
<v Speaker 1>it's strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

185
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was super weird,</v>

186
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.720
<v Speaker 1>especially how the media was portraying</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and how what was actually happening</v>

187
00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:08.480
<v Speaker 1>at the events wasn't what was being</v>
<v Speaker 1>portrayed in the media.</v>

188
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.630
<v Speaker 1>So that was weird to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then people recognizing him on the</v>

189
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:13.040
<v Speaker 1>street is strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

190
00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:15.500
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say what,</v>

191
00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 1>what happened in real life was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was what was being portrayed like what</v>

192
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:20.900
<v Speaker 1>was different?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

193
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.260
<v Speaker 1>mostly what he was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So most of what he said is on film</v>

194
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:25.094
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

195
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 1>So you can go to youtube and see what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been saying.</v>

196
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Like not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not like some secret that's</v>

197
00:08:30.201 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 1>going around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's been portrayed has been so</v>

198
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:35.630
<v Speaker 1>much more negative than what he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually said.</v>

199
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Or they'll take like sound bites and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just weave a story that isn't quite</v>

200
00:08:40.521 --> 00:08:42.410
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which I didn't read it for some reason.</v>

201
00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:45.710
<v Speaker 1>I now it looks silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for some reason I just thought that</v>

202
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 1>what the media was portraying was honest</v>
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>

203
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

204
00:08:50.001 --> 00:08:51.080
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

205
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not,</v>

206
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.010
<v Speaker 1>they're trapped in there and they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right get out.</v>

207
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have an</v>

208
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 2>option to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to see him.</v>

209
00:08:57.781 --> 00:08:59.910
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the different spins though.</v>

210
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.760
<v Speaker 2>All the different women spins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

211
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.540
<v Speaker 2>And W one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one really bizarre spin that I saw was</v>

212
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 2>this one was saying that this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>indicative of the problem of all comedy</v>

213
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:15.351
<v Speaker 2>clubs and aggressive male audience and</v>
<v Speaker 2>women sitting there feeling threatened,</v>

214
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.020
<v Speaker 2>not being able to use their voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like user voice.</v>

215
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:20.140
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you gonna heckle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

216
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.680
<v Speaker 2>They were saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you would be more empowered if</v>

217
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 2>there were more women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you could heckle is,</v>

218
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:27.810
<v Speaker 2>that's not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not supposed to do that at a</v>

219
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:31.500
<v Speaker 2>comedy club have you don't like someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>just don't laugh,</v>

220
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:32.210
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

221
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.950
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this one was,</v>

222
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.560
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not your job or it's not your place</v>

223
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.190
<v Speaker 2>to say that you don't like someone when</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other people do like it.</v>

224
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were right,</v>

225
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.400
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to walk out.</v>

226
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like you're going to see a movie,</v>

227
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.950
<v Speaker 2>like you're an audience member.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The deal is you're not there to perform.</v>

228
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:54.000
<v Speaker 2>The audience is there to just sit there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and laugh or not laugh,</v>

229
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But don't be rude to the other people</v>

230
00:09:55.981 --> 00:09:58.290
<v Speaker 2>that are enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as you break your</v>

231
00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:00.750
<v Speaker 2>sensibilities above the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>

232
00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:01.950
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are a problem,</v>

233
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:02.910
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
