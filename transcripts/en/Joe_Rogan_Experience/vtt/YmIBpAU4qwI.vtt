<v Speaker 1>Thanks for coming on here.</v>

7
00:00:07.451 --> 00:00:08.284
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

8
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.990
<v Speaker 1>You are in the middle of the,</v>

9
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.690
<v Speaker 1>one of the most controversial movies in the history of the world.</v>

10
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.071
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>

13
00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:15.850
<v Speaker 1>You play,</v>

14
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:16.870
<v Speaker 1>I play Kim Jong.</v>

15
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.190
<v Speaker 1>In the interview,</v>

17
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.840
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking crazy,</v>

18
00:00:19.841 --> 00:00:20.674
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

19
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 2>I think it was crazy when I signed on,</v>

20
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I realized it was crazy.</v>

21
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

22
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 2>in the midst of all that.</v>

23
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

24
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.840
<v Speaker 1>What is the verdict?</v>

25
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Because they say that it's not,</v>

26
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.140
<v Speaker 1>it's not North Korea.</v>

27
00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Someone was saying it was an insider at Sony.</v>

28
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.983
<v Speaker 1>They had it.</v>

29
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>They had it narrowed down to a woman who hacked it.</v>

30
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.493
<v Speaker 2>Read that,</v>

31
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.981
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

32
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

33
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.301
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

34
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 2>Cause after they came out with that,</v>

35
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 2>the FBI came out and said,</v>

36
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.661
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

37
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 2>it is North Korea.</v>

38
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 2>We have a lot of information that we haven't released,</v>

39
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.680
<v Speaker 2>but it is trust us.</v>

40
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.603
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>

41
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

42
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:54.301
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

43
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:59.301
<v Speaker 2>the private kind of security experts still think it's not North Korea.</v>

44
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 1>I would almost always go with private security experts over the FBI.</v>

45
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.700
<v Speaker 1>Almost always.</v>

46
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.110
<v Speaker 2>I kind of feel like most people now what also,</v>

47
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of sad,</v>

48
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

49
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.410
<v Speaker 2>sad for the FBI,</v>

50
00:01:12.411 --> 00:01:14.180
<v Speaker 2>but I think most people are questioning it.</v>

51
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>Would you be willing to go over there ever?</v>

52
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>How well and yeah,</v>

53
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.550
<v Speaker 1>ever do you mean like do you mean North Korea specifically?</v>

54
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you mean Oh yes,</v>

55
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:25.700
<v Speaker 1>very specific.</v>

56
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.083
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

58
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>not go over there.</v>

59
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I would never go there.</v>

60
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you went over there under the guidance of Dennis Rodman.</v>

61
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

62
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

63
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 2>I would say I wouldn't go near Dennis Rodman</v>

64
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.421
<v Speaker 2>in America.</v>

65
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 2>I would not go near him,</v>

66
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 2>but I would not go near North Korea at all.</v>

67
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

68
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.310
<v Speaker 2>if the regime topples changes and uh,</v>

69
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

70
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know 20 years from now,</v>

71
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 2>it's the likelihood of that though.</v>

72
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.171
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

73
00:01:58.171 --> 00:01:58.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

74
00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:59.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's,</v>

75
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible,</v>

76
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 2>but in our lifetimes I think.</v>

77
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

78
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.601
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

79
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:04.890
<v Speaker 2>that's the only way I'd go.</v>

80
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.211
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

81
00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about this before the podcast started.</v>

82
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.290
<v Speaker 1>The exchange flashdrives</v>

83
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

84
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Back and forth to each other.</v>

85
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

86
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Like in the eye,</v>

87
00:02:13.481 --> 00:02:14.680
<v Speaker 2>a huge part of</v>

88
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.640
<v Speaker 2>the underground economy there is,</v>

89
00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:21.430
<v Speaker 2>is basically these flash drives with,</v>

90
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.980
<v Speaker 2>with South Korean TV shows,</v>

91
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.821
<v Speaker 2>movies,</v>

92
00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:25.960
<v Speaker 2>American movies,</v>

93
00:02:25.961 --> 00:02:26.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:30.880
<v Speaker 2>just glimpses into the outside world that they're not supposed to see.</v>

95
00:02:30.881 --> 00:02:32.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge underground market.</v>

96
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.143
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>

97
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean the people there,</v>

98
00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:37.990
<v Speaker 2>especially the younger people that they know what's going on,</v>

99
00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:38.530
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

100
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.610
<v Speaker 2>And if they get caught,</v>

101
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.440
<v Speaker 2>not only they fucked.</v>

102
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

103
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:42.760
<v Speaker 2>A day if the,</v>

104
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.100
<v Speaker 2>well this is what I,</v>

105
00:02:44.101 --> 00:02:46.120
<v Speaker 2>I've read and I don't know how it is now.</v>

106
00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:48.460
<v Speaker 2>It might be even worse now for all I know.</v>

107
00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:48.791
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

108
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:53.140
<v Speaker 2>if they get caught they go to a labor camp for,</v>

109
00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:55.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how long that,</v>

110
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:57.190
<v Speaker 2>it's like a three generational thing there.</v>

111
00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Their kids go to a labor there and their parents will go like the hall family</v>

112
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 2>ends up being punished for their action,</v>

113
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 2>which is wild.</v>

114
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.393
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

115
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

116
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:09.061
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

117
00:03:09.061 --> 00:03:11.940
<v Speaker 1>when we hear about like dictatorships like that,</v>

118
00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:14.370
<v Speaker 1>we always think of it that's from like the forties like you know,</v>

119
00:03:14.371 --> 00:03:15.920
<v Speaker 1>you think of it as he is,</v>

120
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.550
<v Speaker 1>it is from the forties that's a thing.</v>

121
00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:20.520
<v Speaker 1>And it just has not changed over there.</v>

122
00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.420
<v Speaker 1>I just wonder what it would take for something like that to be toppled.</v>

124
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.270
<v Speaker 1>And we were also talking before the podcast started about his uncle.</v>

125
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>His uncle apparently was planning some sort of a coup,</v>

126
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:30.660
<v Speaker 1>so yeah.</v>

127
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Killed his uncle.</v>

128
00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.760
<v Speaker 1>Killed his uncle's sons.</v>

129
00:03:32.761 --> 00:03:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

130
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

131
00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:33.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

132
00:03:33.991 --> 00:03:34.171
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

133
00:03:34.171 --> 00:03:35.490
<v Speaker 1>one thing that happened when our,</v>

134
00:03:35.491 --> 00:03:39.420
<v Speaker 1>when our movie was about to come out there was like a some expert</v>

135
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.801
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

136
00:03:39.801 --> 00:03:44.801
<v Speaker 2>on North Korea who said that it's important that the elite in Pyongyang see this</v>

137
00:03:45.571 --> 00:03:46.140
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

138
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.590
<v Speaker 2>especially the people in the,</v>

139
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.051
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

140
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:49.351
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

141
00:03:49.351 --> 00:03:52.380
<v Speaker 2>the government and it working at it because it's so,</v>

142
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.580
<v Speaker 2>it's so they're on such shaky ground right now that for them to see something</v>

143
00:03:56.581 --> 00:04:01.581
<v Speaker 2>like this could really help in getting something to happen over there.</v>

144
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.270
<v Speaker 2>This is what Sony was saying.</v>

145
00:04:03.271 --> 00:04:03.511
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

146
00:04:03.511 --> 00:04:03.691
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

147
00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:04.291
<v Speaker 2>This was like a,</v>

148
00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 2>an expert on it.</v>

149
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.650

<v Speaker 2>of Kim Jong goons.</v>

202
