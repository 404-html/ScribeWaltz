00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.920
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're live.</v>

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.580
<v Speaker 2>How are you sir?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very good,</v>

4
00:00:10.581 --> 00:00:11.450
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good to meet you,</v>

5
00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:12.284
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Great to meet you and thank you very </v>

6
00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 2>much for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned more about coyotes over the</v>

7
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.513
<v Speaker 2>last couple of months reading your book </v>
<v Speaker 2>and listening to your podcast with my </v>

8
00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:21.560
<v Speaker 2>good friend Steve Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was amazing.</v>

9
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.070
<v Speaker 2>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a crazy animal that is.</v>

10
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.953
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have coyotes all around my </v>

11
00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:29.330
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became a very,</v>

12
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:32.323
<v Speaker 2>very close to me when I saw one of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens get captured by a coyote and I </v>

13
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.720
<v Speaker 2>watched him hop the fence with a chicken</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his mouth,</v>

14
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 2>like God damn as motherfuckers and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>all around us especially.</v>

15
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:46.130
<v Speaker 2>I live in a fairly rural area around </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

16
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm about 40 minutes outside of La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

17
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.293
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nights are quiet and you hear him </v>

18
00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:52.514
<v Speaker 2>screaming in the night and I didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>much about them until I started reading </v>

19
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:56.174
<v Speaker 2>your book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

20
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're amazing animal.</v>

21
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:58.761
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

22
00:00:58.761 --> 00:00:59.594
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not really another mammal side </v>

23
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.280
<v Speaker 2>from us that has a biography like these </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals do and that's kind of one of the</v>

24
00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 2>reasons I got fascinated with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

25
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.593
<v Speaker 2>they were doing the same thing around me</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid growing up in </v>

26
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.340
<v Speaker 2>Louisiana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 2>and that's sort of the beginning of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

28
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.103
<v Speaker 2>my getting captivated by these little </v>
<v Speaker 2>small wolves because they were suddenly </v>

29
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:29.690
<v Speaker 2>showing up in the bayous and swamps of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Louisiana when I was 12,</v>

30
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:30.950
<v Speaker 2>13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14 years old.</v>

31
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.233
<v Speaker 2>And as far as I knew this was an animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was supposed to be in the deserts </v>

32
00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 2>of the West.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that seemed to be something that,</v>

33
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.013
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>commanded one's attention that this </v>

34
00:01:44.361 --> 00:01:45.194
<v Speaker 2>critter is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is appearing in places where you would </v>

35
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:48.344
<v Speaker 2>never expect it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now of course everybody in the </v>

36
00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:52.640
<v Speaker 2>country is dealing with them.</v>

37
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.833
<v Speaker 2>That is so fascinating that in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifetime they have spread from the </v>

38
00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:57.974
<v Speaker 2>American southwest to every single state</v>
<v Speaker 2>and literally every single city in the </v>

39
00:02:01.491 --> 00:02:02.324
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

40
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.820
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just got A.</v>

41
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.820
<v Speaker 2>Somebody sent me this yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that somewhere in Georgia they have some</v>

42
00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:14.180
<v Speaker 2>sort of a bounty on these wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coyotes.</v>

43
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.390
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing a lot of people don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that a coyote is a wolf.</v>

44
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

45
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.610
<v Speaker 2>it's a separate species from gray wolves</v>
<v Speaker 2>and red wolves,</v>

46
00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:26.960
<v Speaker 2>but it's out of the North American wolf </v>
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>

47
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

48
00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:31.250
<v Speaker 2>coyotes are distinctive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laid North American animals.</v>

49
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.084
<v Speaker 2>They come out of Canada evolution that </v>
<v Speaker 2>began here five point 3 million years </v>

50
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:36.140
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

51
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:36.861
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

52
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:38.240
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're small wolves.</v>

53
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.890
<v Speaker 2>And I sent you this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie know,</v>

54
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 2>you found it beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the Georgia coyote challenge.</v>

55
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they're offering some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>bounty for each coyote killed.</v>

56
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.073
<v Speaker 2>Now what's fascinating about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things that I learned </v>

57
00:02:50.421 --> 00:02:54.290
<v Speaker 2>from your book is that when a coyote </v>
<v Speaker 2>yells,</v>

58
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:56.390
<v Speaker 2>when they're doing their call in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>night,</v>

59
00:02:56.391 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 2>they're essentially making roll call and</v>
<v Speaker 2>when of them doesn't</v>

60
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 3>respond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the female generates more pups.</v>

61
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.553
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

62
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

63
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 3>one of the many things that's probably </v>
<v Speaker 3>happening when they're,</v>

64
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.983
<v Speaker 3>when they're howling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they are taking a census </v>

65
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 3>basically of coyote populations in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>area.</v>

66
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.160
<v Speaker 3>And the result of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of that census can very well be,</v>

67
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:28.561
<v Speaker 3>it produces some sort of a chemical or </v>
<v Speaker 3>metabolic change in,</v>

68
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 3>in the females,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the breeding females,</v>

69
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 3>the Alpha ones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they end up oftentimes having larger</v>

70
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 3>litters of pumps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why something like this,</v>

71
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:39.683
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just in South Carolina two weeks </v>

72
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 3>ago and there was a lot of conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>

73
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.513
<v Speaker 3>this Georgia bounty because in South </v>
<v Speaker 3>Carolina it's another place where </v>

74
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 3>coyotes are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are fairly new.</v>

75
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 3>I've only been there in the last 20 or </v>
<v Speaker 3>25 years.</v>

76
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 3>They were arguing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

77
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 3>and they had some pretty good science </v>
<v Speaker 3>that coyotes are taking,</v>

78
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.243
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in some areas as many as 60 percent of </v>

79
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 3>the white tail deer fawns.</v>

80
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.303
<v Speaker 3>And so the hunters are screaming along a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot about this because it means it's </v>

81
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.980
<v Speaker 3>getting harder to take a white tail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

82
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.423
<v Speaker 3>so South Carolina hasn't moved to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>step that Georgia has of trying to </v>

83
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:20.584
<v Speaker 3>impose some kind of bounty and encourage</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to go out and shoot these </v>

84
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

85
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 3>to take them in any way they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but mostly shoot them.</v>

86
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

87
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.223
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the states in the south and in </v>

88
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:35.794
<v Speaker 3>the east have a lot to learn by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>western or from the Western experience </v>

89
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:40.684
<v Speaker 3>because the truth is we've been trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to eradicate and I mean totally </v>

90
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:48.010
<v Speaker 3>exterminate coyotes in the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>west.</v>

91
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.553
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we spent the years from about Nineteen </v>

92
00:04:51.281 --> 00:04:56.281
<v Speaker 3>15 through about 1972 in an all out war </v>
<v Speaker 3>attempting to exterminate them.</v>

93
00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 3>And the only result of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

94
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:01.864
<v Speaker 3>as a result of their particular kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptations in their evolution in North </v>

95
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

96
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.780
<v Speaker 3>is that we spread them across the entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

97
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 3>We not only spread them across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire country,</v>

98
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:16.630
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're in every state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They colonize their 49th state,</v>

99
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 3>Delaware in 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the only state,</v>

100
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:19.804
<v Speaker 3>they're not in his Hawaii just because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a stowed away and made it </v>

101
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.920
<v Speaker 3>across the Pacific yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

102
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if they do,</v>

103
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:28.024
<v Speaker 3>you can imagine those endangered </v>
<v Speaker 3>Naynay's on the big island are totally </v>

104
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:31.894
<v Speaker 3>done for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they are not only at every single </v>

105
00:05:34.091 --> 00:05:39.091
<v Speaker 3>state in the union except for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they are 7,000 miles now,</v>

106
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:44.251
<v Speaker 3>north and south and North America from </v>
<v Speaker 3>above the Arctic circle all the way down</v>

107
00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:50.101
<v Speaker 3>to Central America and beginning to </v>
<v Speaker 3>colonize into South America.</v>

108
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Speaker 3>So the attempts to exterminate them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can explain how this,</v>

109
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.793
<v Speaker 3>why this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has to do with their evolution in the </v>

110
00:05:58.821 --> 00:05:59.654
<v Speaker 3>particular adaptations they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the attempts to exterminate them or </v>

111
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:03.464
<v Speaker 3>even to try to control their numbers </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost always produces exactly the </v>

112
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 3>opposite effect.</v>

113
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.313
<v Speaker 3>So Georgia is going to end up with more </v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes than they've ever had before in </v>

114
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:16.940
<v Speaker 3>their efforts to try to suppress their </v>
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>

115
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that fascinating?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it is.</v>

116
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.293
<v Speaker 3>It's so contrary to logic and what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>would think would be the solution for </v>

117
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:24.794
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

118
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.260
<v Speaker 3>and when you go back to the American </v>
<v Speaker 3>west,</v>

119
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Speaker 3>before the reintroduction of wolves into</v>
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone in the 19 nineties,</v>

120
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:37.540
<v Speaker 3>we had essentially extirpated them from </v>
<v Speaker 3>a vast majority of the United States.</v>

121
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 3>There's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very few left,</v>

122
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:39.794
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

123
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll see if he could believe,</v>

124
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.390
<v Speaker 3>explained the relationship that the gray</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves had to the coyotes,</v>

125
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.310
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the reasons that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes became so adaptable.</v>

126
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.051
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

127
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 3>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coyotes didn't become so smart,</v>

128
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the southwest,</v>

129
00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.560
<v Speaker 3>the Hispanics say the only thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>smarter than a coyote is God,</v>

130
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.410
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't become that smart and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that adept,</v>

131
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 3>that surviving anything almost that </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens to them.</v>

132
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of us,</v>

133
00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:12.974
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've only been trying to wipe them out </v>

134
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:19.390
<v Speaker 3>or control their populations for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little more than a century nouse.</v>

135
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.233
<v Speaker 3>And that's too short a time for them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolve these abilities to adapt and </v>

136
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 3>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

137
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.283
<v Speaker 3>they evolved those abilities because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were the small dog and a big dog's </v>

138
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.133
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean gray wolves have this very </v>

139
00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:41.261
<v Speaker 3>interesting story to gray wolves come </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of North American kainate evolution,</v>

140
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:42.194
<v Speaker 3>but they're one of the Canaan species </v>
<v Speaker 3>that ended up leaving North America for </v>

141
00:07:45.651 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 3>a time and evolving for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>million years in Asia and in Europe.</v>

142
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.283
<v Speaker 3>And they didn't come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A gray wolves didn't start coming back </v>

143
00:07:54.051 --> 00:07:54.884
<v Speaker 3>to North America till about 25 or 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago during sort of the height of </v>

144
00:07:58.671 --> 00:07:59.504
<v Speaker 3>the late pleistocene and when they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coyote is of course had been here and </v>

145
00:08:04.551 --> 00:08:09.470
<v Speaker 3>had evolved into their present species </v>
<v Speaker 3>about 800,000 to a million years ago.</v>

146
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.603
<v Speaker 3>And when gray wolves returned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they basically just started </v>

147
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:14.534
<v Speaker 3>kicking the crap out of coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so coyotes evolve their ability to </v>

148
00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:20.774
<v Speaker 3>survive being harassed and persecuted as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a result of being a basically harassed </v>

149
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:27.524
<v Speaker 3>by gray wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is why when you hear about the </v>

150
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:32.570
<v Speaker 3>Coi Wolf that you hear on the east </v>
<v Speaker 3>coast,</v>

151
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.613
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a coyote that bread with the red wolf </v>

152
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.670
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and other eastern wolves,</v>

153
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:38.750
<v Speaker 3>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's correct.</v>

154
00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:39.584
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

155
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.453
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a very interesting story and it's </v>

156
00:08:42.591 --> 00:08:43.424
<v Speaker 3>kind of one of those instances where a </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern event that we're all getting to </v>

157
00:08:49.311 --> 00:08:54.311
<v Speaker 3>witness the emergence of the Coi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wolf has its origins in the evolution of</v>

158
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.613
<v Speaker 3>mammals in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a million years or more because the </v>

159
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 3>raisin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

160
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:07.860
<v Speaker 3>if you think about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason coyotes,</v>

161
00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 3>red wolves and other eastern wolves like</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Algonquin Wolf,</v>

162
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in eastern Canada and,</v>

163
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:15.403
<v Speaker 3>and northern New England,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason those animals can all hybrid </v>

164
00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:21.150
<v Speaker 3>eyes and readily do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>

165
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:25.170
<v Speaker 3>there are no behavioral barriers at all </v>
<v Speaker 3>to them breeding with one another.</v>

166
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.150
<v Speaker 3>And so whenever a coyote shows up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

167
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.980
<v Speaker 3>and it's in the vicinity of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an Algonquin Wolf,</v>

168
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 3>say a female that comes into heat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

169
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:34.584
<v Speaker 3>she'll readily pick a coyote as a mate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the reason they do that is because </v>

170
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 3>those animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>red wolves,</v>

171
00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:46.020
<v Speaker 3>eastern wolves of various kinds and </v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes all seemed to have come out of a</v>

172
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.273
<v Speaker 3>group of animals that unlike the gray </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolf never left North America and they </v>

173
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:52.494
<v Speaker 3>probably didn't separate from one </v>
<v Speaker 3>another until 300,000 to a half million </v>

174
00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:01.830
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that separation is recent enough that</v>

175
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Speaker 3>whenever they encounter one enough with </v>
<v Speaker 3>one another today,</v>

176
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 3>they very readily hybridize.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

177
00:10:07.111 --> 00:10:07.944
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of the result of coyote </v>
<v Speaker 3>spreading across the south has </v>

178
00:10:12.421 --> 00:10:17.421
<v Speaker 3>essentially kind of killed our hope that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were going to save the endangered red</v>

179
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:19.194
<v Speaker 3>wolf as an independent species because </v>
<v Speaker 3>red wolf so quickly and easily </v>

180
00:10:23.881 --> 00:10:28.230
<v Speaker 3>hybridized with coyotes that coyote </v>
<v Speaker 3>genes swamp pure red wolf jeans.</v>

181
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.490
<v Speaker 3>So I mean that's something that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

182
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:37.080
<v Speaker 3>is millions of years or hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousands of years old and evolution,</v>

183
00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Speaker 3>but we're getting to see it play out </v>
<v Speaker 3>right around us in our own time.</v>

184
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.243
<v Speaker 3>And meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gray wolves and coyotes in the West </v>

185
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.513
<v Speaker 3>aren't hybridizing it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the explanation is that </v>

186
00:10:47.131 --> 00:10:50.950
<v Speaker 3>gray wolves left and didn't come back </v>
<v Speaker 3>until why left?</v>

187
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:52.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

188
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:55.920
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they happen to be in evolutionary terms.</v>

189
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.813
<v Speaker 3>One of the groups and jackals did the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing that they ended up leaving </v>

190
00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:01.734
<v Speaker 3>North America and in their absence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while they were in another part of the </v>

191
00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:06.564
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they evolved into the present </v>

192
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.970
<v Speaker 3>subspecies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got four subspecies of gray wolves</v>

193
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.720
<v Speaker 3>in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of which seemed to have come back to</v>

194
00:11:15.721 --> 00:11:17.910
<v Speaker 3>North America by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at different times.</v>

195
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.750
<v Speaker 3>So they had sort of separate migrations </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to North America.</v>

196
00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:24.690
<v Speaker 3>So the Mexican Gray Wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

197
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:27.540
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the western gray wolf,</v>

198
00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:32.570
<v Speaker 3>the Arctic Wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are all gray wolf species,</v>

199
00:11:33.151 --> 00:11:37.080
<v Speaker 3>but they're separated at the sub </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific level and they all seem to have</v>

200
00:11:37.081 --> 00:11:38.820
<v Speaker 3>come back to North America at different </v>
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

201
00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.283
<v Speaker 3>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had left North America like about </v>

202
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.373
<v Speaker 3>three and a half million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they became different animals in </v>

203
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.273
<v Speaker 3>Asia and Europe by the time they came </v>
<v Speaker 3>back then they were different enough </v>

204
00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:55.971
<v Speaker 3>from coyotes that they not only couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>interbreed with them anymore,</v>

205
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 3>but they sort of are mortal enemies of </v>
<v Speaker 3>one another.</v>

206
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.353
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we reintroduced wolves to </v>

207
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:05.980
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone in 1995,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes had,</v>

208
00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:09.130
<v Speaker 3>had 75 years in yellowstone without any </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves.</v>

209
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:10.023
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that served as a wonderful </v>

210
00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:12.694
<v Speaker 3>laboratory to study them too because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>gave us a sense of what happens with </v>

211
00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:20.710
<v Speaker 3>coyotes when nobody is harassing them </v>
<v Speaker 3>when people are harassing him,</v>

212
00:12:20.711 --> 00:12:21.544
<v Speaker 3>which of course we didn't in yellowstone</v>
<v Speaker 3>park and when wolves aren't harassing </v>

213
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:25.864
<v Speaker 3>them either.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we realize is that they create </v>

214
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:29.044
<v Speaker 3>these really stable territory's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They create very stable packs and their </v>

215
00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:33.664
<v Speaker 3>population rises to a particular point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the carrying capacity of the landscape </v>

216
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:38.403
<v Speaker 3>based on what they eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is mostly rodents and rabbits and </v>

217
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:45.751
<v Speaker 3>things and some fruit and berries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't.</v>

218
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.193
<v Speaker 3>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their population sort of levels off and </v>

219
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:50.434
<v Speaker 3>stays at a carrying capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so we got to watch that happen in </v>

220
00:12:54.971 --> 00:12:59.971
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone for like 75 years and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>become sort of the,</v>

221
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:05.440
<v Speaker 3>the example of what would happen if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>just left them alone.</v>

222
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean some people think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

223
00:13:07.061 --> 00:13:09.310
<v Speaker 3>if we don't try to control them how </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna,</v>

224
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.263
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just going to be millions upon </v>

225
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.490
<v Speaker 3>millions of them running everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's actually.</v>

226
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:16.803
<v Speaker 3>They only do that when you try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>persecute them and they go into this </v>

227
00:13:19.661 --> 00:13:20.494
<v Speaker 3>colonization mode and generate more and </v>
<v Speaker 3>more and more pups and have more and </v>

228
00:13:23.921 --> 00:13:27.910
<v Speaker 3>more pups survive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yellowstone in that period from 19,</v>

229
00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:28.744
<v Speaker 3>25 to 1995 was this sort of model of </v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens when you just leave them </v>

230
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:35.583
<v Speaker 3>the hell alone and they just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>rise to a particular population level </v>

231
00:13:41.861 --> 00:13:44.530
<v Speaker 3>and are really stable at that level.</v>

232
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:45.423
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and don't really go beyond it and they </v>

233
00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:49.720
<v Speaker 3>don't expand their territory that we </v>
<v Speaker 3>either know.</v>

234
00:13:49.721 --> 00:13:50.890
<v Speaker 3>They don't seem to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

235
00:13:50.891 --> 00:13:55.891
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that has happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously in the last a hundred years or</v>

236
00:13:56.111 --> 00:14:01.111
<v Speaker 3>so last 75 years at least,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that as a result of persecuting them,</v>

237
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 3>we've sent them into this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>colonization strategy where they,</v>

238
00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:11.830
<v Speaker 3>they have larger litter of pups when </v>
<v Speaker 3>their populations are suppressed,</v>

239
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:16.660
<v Speaker 3>it's easier for them to get the pumps </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they do have to adulthood.</v>

240
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.423
<v Speaker 3>I mean in yellowstone for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things we saw in that period </v>

241
00:14:21.491 --> 00:14:24.520
<v Speaker 3>when they weren't being harassed in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>60 seventies,</v>

242
00:14:24.521 --> 00:14:25.354
<v Speaker 3>eighties is that they would have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>litter of five or six pups and they </v>

243
00:14:29.681 --> 00:14:32.110
<v Speaker 3>could only get a couple of them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>adulthood.</v>

244
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.633
<v Speaker 3>But whenever you try to control their </v>
<v Speaker 3>populations and momentarily suppressed </v>

245
00:14:38.491 --> 00:14:40.330
<v Speaker 3>their populations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

246
00:14:40.331 --> 00:14:41.164
<v Speaker 3>the result is that there's no more food </v>
<v Speaker 3>for coyotes out there for the coyotes </v>

247
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:45.640
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have survived.</v>

248
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.950
<v Speaker 3>And that makes it possible for them to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a litter of seven or eight pups and</v>

249
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.960
<v Speaker 3>get six to seven of them to adulthood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they have this,</v>

250
00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.760
<v Speaker 3>this marvelous ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

251
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.830
<v Speaker 3>I talk about it a good bit in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's called fish and fusion there,</v>

252
00:15:03.831 --> 00:15:04.664
<v Speaker 3>one of the few species and we happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be one of the other mammal species </v>

253
00:15:07.191 --> 00:15:08.024
<v Speaker 3>around the world that does this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they have the ability to exist as </v>

254
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:17.270
<v Speaker 3>a social animal and a case of coyotes as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pack animal of course.</v>

255
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:18.973
<v Speaker 3>But whenever they're pressured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tend to split apart into singles </v>

256
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:25.693
<v Speaker 3>and pairs and they scatter across the </v>
<v Speaker 3>landscape and that's what sends them </v>

257
00:15:31.011 --> 00:15:31.844
<v Speaker 3>colonizing across the continent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that they can do that is what </v>

258
00:15:35.241 --> 00:15:36.740
<v Speaker 3>separates them really from wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

259
00:15:36.741 --> 00:15:38.870
<v Speaker 3>And that's why they weren't able to wipe</v>
<v Speaker 3>them out in the west.</v>

260
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what I mean.</v>

261
00:15:40.311 --> 00:15:42.830
<v Speaker 3>If you think about what happened with </v>
<v Speaker 3>gray wolves,</v>

262
00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:45.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean we started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

263
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:46.004
<v Speaker 3>the sort of in a decided effort to </v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminate gray wolves from the American </v>

264
00:15:52.521 --> 00:15:54.680
<v Speaker 3>West in roughly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

265
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:55.514
<v Speaker 3>we started just ordinary people started </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting out strychnine bait for them in </v>

266
00:15:59.271 --> 00:16:01.160
<v Speaker 3>the 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>16 and 18 seventies.</v>

267
00:16:01.161 --> 00:16:04.310
<v Speaker 3>But was it ranchers at first it started </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was it because of livestock?</v>

268
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.373
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was ranchers and just travelers on </v>

269
00:16:06.981 --> 00:16:09.500
<v Speaker 3>the Oregon trail,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the emigrant trails.</v>

270
00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:10.334
<v Speaker 3>I mean people sort of regarded because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they came out of Europe with a </v>

271
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:16.910
<v Speaker 3>background with wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

272
00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:17.744
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the things that </v>

273
00:16:17.961 --> 00:16:18.794
<v Speaker 3>distinguishes us Americans and coyotes </v>
<v Speaker 3>is that we didn't have coyotes in </v>

274
00:16:23.091 --> 00:16:23.924
<v Speaker 3>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so we didn't arrive with this preloaded </v>

275
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.260
<v Speaker 3>preconception about the role that </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] played in the world,</v>

276
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.650
<v Speaker 3>but we did with animals like bears and </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves.</v>

277
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.680
<v Speaker 3>And so people just from the very </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>

278
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.610
<v Speaker 3>whenever the Atlantic seaboard was </v>
<v Speaker 3>settled,</v>

279
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:45.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were wolf drives and wolf roundups</v>

280
00:16:45.831 --> 00:16:50.831
<v Speaker 3>and every kind of attempt to wipe out </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves as competitors with us,</v>

281
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.850
<v Speaker 3>for our stock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in the west,</v>

282
00:16:55.851 --> 00:16:58.330
<v Speaker 3>people just through strychnine bait out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me.</v>

283
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.520
<v Speaker 3>Strychnine was invented in Pennsylvania </v>
<v Speaker 3>in 18,</v>

284
00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:04.510
<v Speaker 3>48 and it was widely available,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

285
00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:05.413
<v Speaker 3>in places like Missouri when you set out</v>
<v Speaker 3>across the West and people would just </v>

286
00:17:08.721 --> 00:17:10.270
<v Speaker 3>buy a bunch of baits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they would,</v>

287
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:12.560
<v Speaker 3>if they hung around long enough to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>the animal,</v>

288
00:17:12.561 --> 00:17:14.750
<v Speaker 3>they would skin it and try to sell the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pill,</v>

289
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:20.080
<v Speaker 3>but they just poisoned them like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then in starting in Nineteen 15,</v>

290
00:17:20.511 --> 00:17:24.890
<v Speaker 3>this government agency called the bureau</v>
<v Speaker 3>of biological survey,</v>

291
00:17:24.891 --> 00:17:29.891
<v Speaker 3>which positions itself as the solution </v>
<v Speaker 3>to predators first decides that it's the</v>

292
00:17:31.641 --> 00:17:32.474
<v Speaker 3>wolf that we need to take out and I mean</v>
<v Speaker 3>they managed to take out the the last </v>

293
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:41.803
<v Speaker 3>probably quarter million wolves in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>West in the space of a little more than </v>

294
00:17:45.741 --> 00:17:49.920
<v Speaker 3>a decade and they do it as you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentioned,</v>

295
00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:53.760
<v Speaker 3>primarily because wolves are such pack </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>

296
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.820
<v Speaker 3>so pack oriented that if you could kill </v>
<v Speaker 3>our trap one member of a pack,</v>

297
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.793
<v Speaker 3>you could use the scent from that animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>and ended up catching every single </v>

298
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.293
<v Speaker 3>animal in the pack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but coyotes responded to that kind of </v>

299
00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:11.880
<v Speaker 3>pressure in a very different way.</v>

300
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you started pressuring them,</v>

301
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.280
<v Speaker 3>they tended,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their packs tended to break up.</v>

302
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:22.310
<v Speaker 3>They tended to scatter and go into this </v>
<v Speaker 3>fish mode and so indeed,</v>

303
00:18:22.441 --> 00:18:23.274
<v Speaker 3>as you said a minute ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly why we were able to take </v>

304
00:18:27.001 --> 00:18:29.370
<v Speaker 3>out wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By the middle of the 19 twenties,</v>

305
00:18:29.371 --> 00:18:32.250
<v Speaker 3>we pretty much had resolved the wolf </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue in the west,</v>

306
00:18:32.251 --> 00:18:36.600
<v Speaker 3>but year after year after year as wolf </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers a decline.</v>

307
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll offer an example in Montana,</v>

308
00:18:39.721 --> 00:18:40.730
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>

309
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:41.573
<v Speaker 3>99,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the State of Montana boundaried 23,000 </v>

310
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.430
<v Speaker 3>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was 18,</v>

311
00:18:47.431 --> 00:18:51.840
<v Speaker 3>99,</v>
<v Speaker 3>21 years later by 1920.</v>

312
00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.213
<v Speaker 3>They only paid bounties on 17 gray </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves because they had basically wiped </v>

313
00:18:58.141 --> 00:18:58.974
<v Speaker 3>them out and then the government agency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the biological survey came in and </v>

314
00:19:02.191 --> 00:19:03.024
<v Speaker 3>cleaned up all the rest of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but every year from 1899 slash 19 slash </v>

315
00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.960
<v Speaker 3>21 and right on into the 19 thirties in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Montana,</v>

316
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:14.340
<v Speaker 3>they were bouncing 30,000 coyotes in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>99 and 1910.</v>

317
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.450
<v Speaker 3>30,000 coyotes and 1918,</v>
<v Speaker 3>33,000 coyotes.</v>

318
00:19:18.451 --> 00:19:19.284
<v Speaker 3>I mean the number of coyotes never </v>
<v Speaker 3>dropped while wolf populations just </v>

319
00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.630
<v Speaker 3>plummeted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Data is so fascinating.</v>

320
00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:27.200
<v Speaker 3>What a crazy little animal that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

321
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:28.913
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so wonderfully counterintuitive in </v>

322
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:35.034
<v Speaker 3>the whole kind of environmental story of</v>
<v Speaker 3>America because what you always expect </v>

323
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:43.881
<v Speaker 3>is that anytime we put our mind to </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking on some creature and,</v>

324
00:19:44.261 --> 00:19:46.200
<v Speaker 3>and taking it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we can do it.</v>

325
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

326
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.223
<v Speaker 3>the only time this never really happened</v>
<v Speaker 3>was in Moby Dick where captain Ahab is </v>

327
00:19:54.391 --> 00:19:58.560
<v Speaker 3>driven mad by his inability to control </v>
<v Speaker 3>the great white whale and the control of</v>

328
00:19:58.561 --> 00:20:03.280
<v Speaker 3>nature and that in a lot of places that </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems to be where we,</v>

329
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:08.810
<v Speaker 3>we land when people realized that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't do anything about coyotes,</v>

330
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.733
<v Speaker 3>it Kinda drives people out of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>minds because this is just not the </v>

331
00:20:14.341 --> 00:20:15.174
<v Speaker 3>American way.</v>

332
00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.070
<v Speaker 3>We can always deal with an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

333
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.913
<v Speaker 3>it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's got to be very frustrating to </v>

334
00:20:21.271 --> 00:20:22.890
<v Speaker 3>people and a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

335
00:20:22.891 --> 00:20:24.780
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

336
00:20:24.781 --> 00:20:27.310
<v Speaker 3>it's really kind of magical and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>ways that,</v>

337
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.980
<v Speaker 3>that they're so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so adaptable and that all came,</v>

338
00:20:31.981 --> 00:20:34.770
<v Speaker 3>you're saying because of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship with the gray wolf.</v>

339
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Now how do we know that the gray wolf </v>
<v Speaker 3>left?</v>

340
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.353
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that they're still wolves in </v>

341
00:20:42.451 --> 00:20:43.720
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

342
00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.380
<v Speaker 3>there's no question about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

343
00:20:46.381 --> 00:20:49.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a tricky question.</v>

344
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a,</v>

345
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:52.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I would hasten to say,</v>

346
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.910
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a geneticist.</v>

347
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.013
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even a biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm basically an environmental writer </v>

348
00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.970
<v Speaker 3>and somebody who uses history a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

349
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.800
<v Speaker 3>and there is unresolved science out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and buy what I mean.</v>

350
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.903
<v Speaker 3>What I mean by that is that there are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple of different camps that have </v>

351
00:21:17.891 --> 00:21:22.180
<v Speaker 3>advanced positions about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>relationship between all these different</v>

352
00:21:22.181 --> 00:21:26.290
<v Speaker 3>wolves that we have in North America and</v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes.</v>

353
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:31.810
<v Speaker 3>So there is a guy at Ucla,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here in Los Angeles.</v>

354
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.240
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his name was Robert Wayne,</v>

355
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.233
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he has done a genetic work on chain </v>

356
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.130
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

357
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.090
<v Speaker 3>one of his papers is called,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

358
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.433
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the title includes the phrase and </v>

359
00:21:45.861 --> 00:21:48.430
<v Speaker 3>Magmatic Wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Canids,</v>

360
00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.870
<v Speaker 3>and he's done the genetic analysis on </v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes,</v>

361
00:21:52.871 --> 00:21:54.520
<v Speaker 3>red wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gray wolves,</v>

362
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:59.140
<v Speaker 3>and eastern wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his argument is that</v>

363
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:04.930
<v Speaker 3>gray wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>red wolves,</v>

364
00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:09.990
<v Speaker 3>and eastern wolves are all actually some</v>
<v Speaker 3>version of gray wolves.</v>

365
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:14.343
<v Speaker 3>So that's a different argument than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>one that I made for you just a few </v>

366
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:19.030
<v Speaker 3>minutes ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been following,</v>

367
00:22:19.031 --> 00:22:23.350
<v Speaker 3>and I've followed in my book because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>found it a more compelling argument,</v>

368
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.850
<v Speaker 3>one advanced by a group of geneticists </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Canada,</v>

369
00:22:27.851 --> 00:22:31.060
<v Speaker 3>led by a guy named Paul Wilson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the,</v>

370
00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.013
<v Speaker 3>that's the position that the US fish and</v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife service and it's endangered </v>

371
00:22:35.711 --> 00:22:40.711
<v Speaker 3>species division takes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And their argument is that the gray wolf</v>

372
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:46.330
<v Speaker 3>is a separate animal from the Red Wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the eastern wolf,</v>

373
00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.500
<v Speaker 3>and the coyote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

374
00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.560
<v Speaker 3>they argue that coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>red wolves,</v>

375
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.460
<v Speaker 3>and eastern wolves all come out of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>clade,</v>

376
00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.500
<v Speaker 3>the biological term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>

377
00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:57.611
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>
<v Speaker 3>l a,</v>

378
00:22:57.611 --> 00:22:58.444
<v Speaker 3>d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>e,</v>

379
00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.560
<v Speaker 3>a clade of animals that are purely North</v>
<v Speaker 3>American in origin.</v>

380
00:23:02.561 --> 00:23:03.394
<v Speaker 3>And that had a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably a similar ancestor as recently </v>

381
00:23:07.031 --> 00:23:10.810
<v Speaker 3>as maybe 300,000 years to 500,000 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

382
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:16.980
<v Speaker 3>So we've got two different arguments </v>
<v Speaker 3>about the relationship of coyotes to two</v>

383
00:23:17.751 --> 00:23:20.980
<v Speaker 3>worlds and I don't know who's going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>win it,</v>

384
00:23:20.981 --> 00:23:23.590
<v Speaker 3>but one of the reasons I tend to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>favor the,</v>

385
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.203
<v Speaker 3>the Paul Wilson Line of argument and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>one that the US fish and wildlife </v>

386
00:23:29.411 --> 00:23:32.180
<v Speaker 3>service is using is because they use </v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

387
00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.093
<v Speaker 3>they use evidence beyond just genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also use morphology and they use </v>

388
00:23:37.181 --> 00:23:39.250
<v Speaker 3>fossils.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

389
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:42.700
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert Wayne and the group,</v>

390
00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:43.873
<v Speaker 3>a geneticists who work with him all </v>
<v Speaker 3>seemed just rely specifically on </v>

391
00:23:48.381 --> 00:23:49.214
<v Speaker 3>genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they don't ever try to verify there </v>

392
00:23:51.501 --> 00:23:53.660
<v Speaker 3>findings by looking at the fossil </v>
<v Speaker 3>record,</v>

393
00:23:53.661 --> 00:23:55.460
<v Speaker 3>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

394
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:59.960
<v Speaker 3>so I don't know how it's going to play </v>
<v Speaker 3>out between these two groups,</v>

395
00:23:59.961 --> 00:24:00.794
<v Speaker 3>but I find the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Canadian geneticists that has </v>

396
00:24:06.021 --> 00:24:06.854
<v Speaker 3>informed the US fish and wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 3>services strategy a little bit more </v>

397
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:11.480
<v Speaker 3>compelling right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

398
00:24:11.481 --> 00:24:13.010
<v Speaker 3>it's something to pay attention to.</v>

399
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:14.180
<v Speaker 3>We'll see how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

400
00:24:14.181 --> 00:24:15.014
<v Speaker 3>it seems like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need some sort of a really </v>

401
00:24:17.121 --> 00:24:17.954
<v Speaker 3>comprehensive way of looking at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're dealing with so many </v>

402
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:21.500
<v Speaker 3>different factors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

403
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:26.501
<v Speaker 3>If you're trying to acquire evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on 25,000 years ago,</v>

404
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.670
<v Speaker 3>it seems like there's got to be a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>different ways.</v>

405
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:33.830
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very odd to me that we know as much</v>

406
00:24:33.831 --> 00:24:34.670
<v Speaker 3>as we do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

407
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:35.563
<v Speaker 3>I mean in to try to figure it all out as</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to be incredibly frustrating when </v>

408
00:24:39.411 --> 00:24:42.440
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with so little evidence </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're looking at the fossil record.</v>

409
00:24:42.441 --> 00:24:45.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean a lot of the animals that die </v>
<v Speaker 3>25,000 years ago,</v>

410
00:24:45.891 --> 00:24:47.720
<v Speaker 3>there's zero evidence of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

411
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:48.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

412
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:51.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a 25,000 years ago,</v>

413
00:24:51.231 --> 00:24:53.560
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the light pleistocene,</v>

414
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.233
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the evidence from labrea tar pit </v>

415
00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:01.640
<v Speaker 3>indicates that coyotes were a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 3>different animal than they are now.</v>

416
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.330
<v Speaker 3>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

417
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:07.640
<v Speaker 3>at the time we think gray wolves were </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming back into North America,</v>

418
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:09.650
<v Speaker 3>returning to their evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 3>homeland.</v>

419
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:12.710
<v Speaker 3>Coyotes were much bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more strapping,</v>

420
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:15.410
<v Speaker 3>had larger dentition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger jaws.</v>

421
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:17.143
<v Speaker 3>And what looks like happened is when </v>
<v Speaker 3>gray wolves arrived in the west and </v>

422
00:25:21.741 --> 00:25:25.280
<v Speaker 3>began competing with these larger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more strapping coyotes,</v>

423
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.630
<v Speaker 3>coyotes sort of sought a different path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

424
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:35.140
<v Speaker 3>they sort of stepped back away from </v>
<v Speaker 3>outright competition with an even bigger</v>

425
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:40.350
<v Speaker 3>Canaan and evolved into a smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more grass.</v>

426
00:25:40.351 --> 00:25:45.351
<v Speaker 3>I'll animal that was not so much just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pure Predator and scavenger,</v>

427
00:25:45.741 --> 00:25:49.370
<v Speaker 3>but more omnivorous and so became our </v>
<v Speaker 3>modern canus,</v>

428
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.130
<v Speaker 3>lutron's species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

429
00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:53.430
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was,</v>

430
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.620
<v Speaker 3>we'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

431
00:25:54.621 --> 00:25:56.360
<v Speaker 3>as you mentioned a minute ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

432
00:25:56.361 --> 00:25:57.194
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to know all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Much of this information is fairly </v>

433
00:26:00.801 --> 00:26:02.330
<v Speaker 3>recent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

434
00:26:02.331 --> 00:26:03.164
<v Speaker 3>we just got a kind of a reappraisal of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the taxonomy of the North American </v>

435
00:26:08.841 --> 00:26:13.490
<v Speaker 3>wolves essentially in the last seven or </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight or 10 years.</v>

436
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.910
<v Speaker 3>Our other wolves omnivorous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or is it just coyotes?</v>

437
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves can be omnivorous,</v>

438
00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:23.840
<v Speaker 3>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're pretty much really a carnivorous</v>

439
00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.370
<v Speaker 3>pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Predators.</v>

440
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:29.990
<v Speaker 3>I find coyote crap in my yard all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and it's got berries in it.</v>

441
00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:30.890
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

442
00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Like they eat a lot of these little red </v>
<v Speaker 3>berries that grow out here.</v>

443
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:34.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

444
00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:35.630
<v Speaker 3>they eat juniper's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

445
00:26:35.631 --> 00:26:36.464
<v Speaker 3>the same thing is happening at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My place in New Mexico starting </v>

446
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.630
<v Speaker 3>essentially about in August or </v>
<v Speaker 3>September,</v>

447
00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:45.000
<v Speaker 3>all the coyote droppings that I've found</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the place.</v>

448
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:45.893
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I've got a lot of coyotes on my </v>

449
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:48.340
<v Speaker 3>place in New Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

450
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:50.400
<v Speaker 3>has just been filled with juniper </v>
<v Speaker 3>berries.</v>

451
00:26:50.401 --> 00:26:52.620
<v Speaker 3>That's what they've been eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean they,</v>

452
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.740
<v Speaker 3>they still are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

453
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.420
<v Speaker 3>running down rabbits and eating rats and</v>
<v Speaker 3>mice and things.</v>

454
00:26:57.421 --> 00:27:00.390
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they move into cities,</v>

455
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:03.750
<v Speaker 3>they tend to eat and they have access to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fruit trees.</v>

456
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.630
<v Speaker 3>They tend to eat a lot of fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they'll,</v>

457
00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.131
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

458
00:27:07.131 --> 00:27:07.964
<v Speaker 3>that people have posted photos on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>internet or youtube videos that show </v>

459
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:15.054
<v Speaker 3>them plucking apples and peaches and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things off trees in their backyards and </v>

460
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:21.570
<v Speaker 3>they really go for that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So bizarre.</v>

461
00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:22.953
<v Speaker 3>It was just such a strange animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so do we know if wolves do anything </v>

462
00:27:27.421 --> 00:27:29.640
<v Speaker 3>like that or is it just a coyote </v>
<v Speaker 3>characteristic?</v>

463
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.680
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty much a coyote </v>
<v Speaker 3>characteristic.</v>

464
00:27:31.681 --> 00:27:32.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

465
00:27:32.591 --> 00:27:34.890
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as we've been saying,</v>

466
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:40.460
<v Speaker 3>the coyote in an evolutionary sense is </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

467
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.620
<v Speaker 3>a small wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

468
00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.570
<v Speaker 3>but it is different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially from gray wolves.</v>

469
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.880
<v Speaker 3>And one of the ways it's different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

470
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.793
<v Speaker 3>that the biologist and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavioralists who have watched coyotes </v>

471
00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:59.940
<v Speaker 3>interact with one another and watch gray</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves interact with one another,</v>

472
00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:01.343
<v Speaker 3>is an indication of how much more pack </v>
<v Speaker 3>oriented Hanse sort of predatory </v>

473
00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:11.121
<v Speaker 3>carnivorous wolves are wolves because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they exist mostly as despite our,</v>

474
00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.680
<v Speaker 3>in our cultural motif of the lone wolf.</v>

475
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.993
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves are such pack animals that they </v>

476
00:28:19.501 --> 00:28:24.501
<v Speaker 3>have a much wider range of expressions </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they convey to one another in their</v>

477
00:28:27.031 --> 00:28:30.060
<v Speaker 3>interactions with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they,</v>

478
00:28:30.061 --> 00:28:30.894
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they basically will sort of engage with </v>

479
00:28:36.541 --> 00:28:37.374
<v Speaker 3>one another and a repertoire of grimaces</v>
<v Speaker 3>and grands and showing their teeth are </v>

480
00:28:44.881 --> 00:28:46.170
<v Speaker 3>curling their lip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

481
00:28:46.171 --> 00:28:47.004
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of body language were they </v>
<v Speaker 3>curl their tails under a and they'll </v>

482
00:28:51.301 --> 00:28:56.301
<v Speaker 3>drop their heads and drop her ears.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coyotes have a similar repertoire,</v>

483
00:28:56.311 --> 00:29:00.600
<v Speaker 3>but it's a much more limited one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the argument that the behavioralists</v>

484
00:29:00.601 --> 00:29:04.860
<v Speaker 3>make is that that's an indication of an </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal that's not so packed oriented.</v>

485
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:09.900
<v Speaker 3>It's not living exclusively in a social </v>
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>

486
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.793
<v Speaker 3>It can go off on its own or as a pair </v>
<v Speaker 3>and therefore doesn't really need all </v>

487
00:29:15.811 --> 00:29:18.330
<v Speaker 3>those facial expressions to convey </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotion.</v>

488
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:22.020
<v Speaker 3>So how do we know that that all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals,</v>

489
00:29:22.021 --> 00:29:22.854
<v Speaker 3>all these canids evolved in North </v>
<v Speaker 3>America and then spread out and went to </v>

490
00:29:26.221 --> 00:29:28.890
<v Speaker 3>Asia and Africa and all these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>places?</v>

491
00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's out of the fossil record.</v>

492
00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:33.540
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean there's a,</v>

493
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.220
<v Speaker 3>there's a good science in the fossil </v>
<v Speaker 3>record of candidate evolution.</v>

494
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:39.443
<v Speaker 3>As I said a bit ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems to go back to about five point </v>

495
00:29:43.031 --> 00:29:47.830
<v Speaker 3>3 million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all the cane is all around the world</v>

496
00:29:47.831 --> 00:29:48.664
<v Speaker 3>seem to have come out of this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this singular origin much the way all </v>

497
00:29:52.751 --> 00:29:56.530
<v Speaker 3>the primates of the world came out of an</v>
<v Speaker 3>origin in Africa.</v>

498
00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:58.690
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

499
00:29:58.691 --> 00:30:00.100
<v Speaker 3>and the horses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

500
00:30:00.101 --> 00:30:00.934
<v Speaker 3>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horses came out of an evolutionary </v>

501
00:30:02.561 --> 00:30:07.270
<v Speaker 3>origin in North America and then spread </v>
<v Speaker 3>across the land bridges to become zebras</v>

502
00:30:07.271 --> 00:30:11.470
<v Speaker 3>in Africa for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's how it happened.</v>

503
00:30:11.471 --> 00:30:13.900
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of these,</v>

504
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:15.243
<v Speaker 3>these animals like jackals for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the golden jackals seemed to have </v>

505
00:30:19.961 --> 00:30:24.520
<v Speaker 3>separated from the small chain Id,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coyote,</v>

506
00:30:24.521 --> 00:30:25.354
<v Speaker 3>the line that led to coyote is about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million years ago and it crossed the </v>

507
00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:33.400
<v Speaker 3>land bridge into Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Southern Europe,</v>

508
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:39.240
<v Speaker 3>parts of Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and became an animal that never returned</v>

509
00:30:40.411 --> 00:30:41.244
<v Speaker 3>in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because of its separation from </v>

510
00:30:43.601 --> 00:30:46.060
<v Speaker 3>coyotes by a million years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it became a,</v>

511
00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:48.520
<v Speaker 3>a different creature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So crazy.</v>

512
00:30:48.521 --> 00:30:50.350
<v Speaker 3>They all did that on foot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

513
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:51.650
<v Speaker 3>they did it somehow know that</v>

514
00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:55.330
<v Speaker 2>the animal came from North America and </v>
<v Speaker 2>made it all the way to Africa.</v>

515
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.210
<v Speaker 2>And I want to bring something up that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you talked about just now.</v>

516
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:02.920
<v Speaker 2>The horses evolved in North America and </v>
<v Speaker 2>became zebras.</v>

517
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean all that started here,</v>

518
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.943
<v Speaker 2>but then they weren't here anymore and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they were reintroduced to the </v>

519
00:31:09.821 --> 00:31:10.654
<v Speaker 2>native Americans by the Europeans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happened to the horses that </v>

520
00:31:13.691 --> 00:31:14.524
<v Speaker 2>were here?</v>

521
00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:16.623
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of the great mysteries of a </v>

522
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.450
<v Speaker 3>North American evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

523
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.373
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a frank answer is we don't really know </v>

524
00:31:25.601 --> 00:31:27.850
<v Speaker 3>what happened to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so this is,</v>

525
00:31:27.851 --> 00:31:28.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

526
00:31:28.931 --> 00:31:33.931
<v Speaker 3>maybe somebody out there listening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe in the next 10 or 15 years,</v>

527
00:31:35.051 --> 00:31:35.884
<v Speaker 3>we'll solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will solve this problem because here </v>

528
00:31:39.971 --> 00:31:44.560
<v Speaker 3>we have a group of animals whose </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary.</v>

529
00:31:44.561 --> 00:31:46.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm in case of the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're evolutionary origins.</v>

530
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:51.610
<v Speaker 3>Go back 56 million years in North </v>
<v Speaker 3>America,</v>

531
00:31:51.611 --> 00:31:55.230
<v Speaker 3>so 10 times a greater depth and time </v>
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>

532
00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:56.123
<v Speaker 3>than the canids do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they're here in all sorts of </v>

533
00:32:00.011 --> 00:32:01.390
<v Speaker 3>forms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone has heard,</v>

534
00:32:01.391 --> 00:32:03.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the three toed horse,</v>

535
00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.633
<v Speaker 3>I'm a Eo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hipaa says what it's called now that </v>

536
00:32:09.911 --> 00:32:12.610
<v Speaker 3>gradually becomes bigger and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

537
00:32:12.611 --> 00:32:13.444
<v Speaker 3>it's hooves fused together and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>become hardened because it's running </v>

538
00:32:17.621 --> 00:32:20.950
<v Speaker 3>over rocky ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it has to have hard hooves.</v>

539
00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.173
<v Speaker 3>And because it begins to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it starts as a browsing animal in the </v>

540
00:32:25.001 --> 00:32:28.630
<v Speaker 3>forest and ultimately becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 3>grassland animal and it's eating grasses</v>

541
00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.480
<v Speaker 3>that are often coated with windblown </v>
<v Speaker 3>sand.</v>

542
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:32.583
<v Speaker 3>So it has to evolve very strong and hard</v>
<v Speaker 3>and namel and on its teeth in order </v>

543
00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.790
<v Speaker 3>resists having its being eroded down by </v>
<v Speaker 3>San.</v>

544
00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:46.300
<v Speaker 3>It becomes ultimately by 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20,000 years ago,</v>

545
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:47.653
<v Speaker 3>an animal that we would not be able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>tell a would be any different from a </v>

546
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:53.894
<v Speaker 3>modern horse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would look exactly like a modern </v>

547
00:32:55.851 --> 00:32:57.470
<v Speaker 3>horse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same size.</v>

548
00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.473
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've seen skeletons of some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the horses that were in North America </v>

549
00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:01.813
<v Speaker 3>down to about 11,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even the paleontologists would have </v>

550
00:33:05.181 --> 00:33:06.014
<v Speaker 3>a hard time telling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the skeleton of a North </v>

551
00:33:09.410 --> 00:33:10.243
<v Speaker 3>American Horse Inn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was the skeleton of a modern </v>

552
00:33:11.451 --> 00:33:12.284
<v Speaker 3>domestic horse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these animals had had traveled </v>

553
00:33:15.621 --> 00:33:16.454
<v Speaker 3>across the land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bridges the bering land bridge when it </v>

554
00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:23.510
<v Speaker 3>was open and had ended up in Asia and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa and Europe where they survived.</v>

555
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:24.853
<v Speaker 3>But for some bizarre reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometime between about 10,000 years ago </v>

556
00:33:29.721 --> 00:33:33.140
<v Speaker 3>and 8,000 years ago and North America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they disappeared.</v>

557
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:34.483
<v Speaker 3>They completely went extinct in North </v>
<v Speaker 3>America and so when we Europeans </v>

558
00:33:41.241 --> 00:33:44.420
<v Speaker 3>returned them to North America 500 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

559
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:45.523
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons they become such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>success and just spread across the </v>

560
00:33:50.541 --> 00:33:51.374
<v Speaker 3>western part of the continent and </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiply into the millions is because </v>

561
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.780
<v Speaker 3>they're already pre adapted to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>landscape.</v>

562
00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.380
<v Speaker 3>This is where they had evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they've already got the hooves.</v>

563
00:34:00.381 --> 00:34:01.214
<v Speaker 3>They've got the teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got the running ability that he </v>

564
00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:03.913
<v Speaker 3>got the bill to buck off predators and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they get back here in North America and </v>

565
00:34:08.871 --> 00:34:09.704
<v Speaker 3>within the space of about a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after they get loose from the Pueblo </v>

566
00:34:13.371 --> 00:34:18.200
<v Speaker 3>revolt in 1680,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within the space of about 50 to 60 or 70</v>

567
00:34:18.201 --> 00:34:20.480
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're all the way up into Canada.</v>

568
00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:24.200
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are within 100 years,</v>

569
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.093
<v Speaker 3>probably as many as 2 million of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>spreading across the West reinhabiting </v>

570
00:34:29.751 --> 00:34:32.930
<v Speaker 3>their own ecological niche.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just fit like a glove,</v>

571
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:34.370
<v Speaker 3>fit like a glove man.</v>

572
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:37.050
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

573
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:37.933
<v Speaker 3>and they became an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fascinating thing to kind of </v>

574
00:34:41.751 --> 00:34:46.751
<v Speaker 3>imagine because the West 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

575
00:34:47.211 --> 00:34:52.211
<v Speaker 3>25,000 years ago had been a place where </v>
<v Speaker 3>horses had made up and some parts of the</v>

576
00:34:53.451 --> 00:34:54.284
<v Speaker 3>West as much of as a third of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>biomass of all the grazing animals and </v>

577
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.280
<v Speaker 3>in the 17 hundreds and 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were doing the same thing again.</v>

578
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:11.330
<v Speaker 3>They were multiplying into the hundreds </v>
<v Speaker 3>of thousands.</v>

579
00:35:11.331 --> 00:35:12.164
<v Speaker 3>The millions gradually spreading New </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexico is where the domestic European </v>

580
00:35:16.731 --> 00:35:17.564
<v Speaker 3>horse got loose and began to spread and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they had reached all the way up into </v>

581
00:35:21.561 --> 00:35:25.820
<v Speaker 3>Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wyoming into into the edges of Canada by</v>

582
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.200
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50,</v>

583
00:35:27.201 --> 00:35:28.430
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>60 or so,</v>

584
00:35:28.431 --> 00:35:32.840
<v Speaker 3>and had probably were at least two to 3 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million of them at that point.</v>

585
00:35:32.841 --> 00:35:35.530
<v Speaker 3>So they were just reinhabiting there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

586
00:35:35.531 --> 00:35:40.531
<v Speaker 3>landscape and fitting into an ecology </v>
<v Speaker 3>now that had been dominated by bison for</v>

587
00:35:41.491 --> 00:35:44.460
<v Speaker 3>a long time and now horses are back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mix.</v>

588
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:47.910
<v Speaker 3>And horses today are very controversial </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

589
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.140
<v Speaker 3>Wild horses are in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

590
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:53.520
<v Speaker 3>people trying to think of him as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>invasive species,</v>

591
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:57.390
<v Speaker 3>but essentially they're just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>reintroduce species.</v>

592
00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.840
<v Speaker 3>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of controversy on how they</v>

593
00:36:00.841 --> 00:36:02.760
<v Speaker 3>should be dealt with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some people want to deal with them,</v>

594
00:36:02.761 --> 00:36:04.650
<v Speaker 3>like almost like they deal with wild </v>
<v Speaker 3>pigs.</v>

595
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:05.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

596
00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:06.930
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

597
00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:07.860
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

598
00:36:07.861 --> 00:36:09.450
<v Speaker 3>there are plenty of people out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

599
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:15.530
<v Speaker 3>who argue that the domestic horse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the feral horse in the west,</v>

600
00:36:15.931 --> 00:36:20.931
<v Speaker 3>which is the root stock of most of our </v>
<v Speaker 3>population of wild horses in the West,</v>

601
00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.470
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

602
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:23.303
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially it's a European animal that </v>

603
00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:28.180
<v Speaker 3>has become an invader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

604
00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:30.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always,</v>

605
00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:33.990
<v Speaker 3>and I've had arguments on stage with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people who,</v>

606
00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:35.070
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

607
00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:37.860
<v Speaker 3>expressed this position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always say,</v>

608
00:36:37.861 --> 00:36:39.990
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you have to say about the horse,</v>

609
00:36:39.991 --> 00:36:43.170
<v Speaker 3>first of all is that a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

610
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.080
<v Speaker 3>it's an American animal with an </v>
<v Speaker 3>asterisk.</v>

611
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:49.980
<v Speaker 3>It's gone for about eight or 9,000 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

612
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:56.240
<v Speaker 3>That's actually not a huge amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time in evolutionary terms.</v>

613
00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:02.600
<v Speaker 3>And even though we did domesticate them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and began to produce some breeds,</v>

614
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:04.553
<v Speaker 3>horses left to their own devices pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly breed back to the wild look and </v>

615
00:37:09.001 --> 00:37:10.080
<v Speaker 3>the wild state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

616
00:37:10.081 --> 00:37:13.830
<v Speaker 3>they'll acquire those dorsal stripes </v>
<v Speaker 3>down their backs.</v>

617
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:18.510
<v Speaker 3>And Zebra striping on their legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so zebra striping.</v>

618
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

619
00:37:19.441 --> 00:37:20.110
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

620
00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:20.943
<v Speaker 3>is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of controversy as to what </v>

621
00:37:22.261 --> 00:37:24.090
<v Speaker 3>the Zebra striping is for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

622
00:37:24.091 --> 00:37:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Is it to distract predators of the idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind it?</v>

623
00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:29.190
<v Speaker 3>It may have been that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

624
00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.130
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not quite sure I can say whether the</v>

625
00:37:32.131 --> 00:37:36.120
<v Speaker 3>Zebra striping evolved for a specific,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a specific reason.</v>

626
00:37:36.121 --> 00:37:40.680
<v Speaker 3>Although most changes and animals do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

627
00:37:40.681 --> 00:37:45.420
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they will fairly readily go back to this</v>

628
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.313
<v Speaker 3>early wild horse look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is probably what horses looked </v>

629
00:37:49.801 --> 00:37:51.870
<v Speaker 3>like in North America 10,000 years ago.</v>

630
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.440
<v Speaker 3>See if you can find some pictures of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like wild horses with Zebra stripes.</v>

631
00:37:55.441 --> 00:37:56.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've ever seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

632
00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.580
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fascinating.</v>

633
00:37:57.581 --> 00:37:59.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look in the Pryor Mountains,</v>

634
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:00.743
<v Speaker 3>wild horse range in Montana and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>see a whole population of animals that </v>

635
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:07.740
<v Speaker 3>come out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that background.</v>

636
00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.593
<v Speaker 3>They have a very interesting history </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was a group of animals that </v>

637
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:16.290
<v Speaker 3>Lewis and Clark acquired from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Indians and they were going to take back</v>

638
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:19.820
<v Speaker 3>and trade in the Mandan villages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

639
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.170
<v Speaker 3>and a guy named,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

640
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.063
<v Speaker 3>prior who was responsible for the herd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was driving them through the today's </v>

641
00:38:27.121 --> 00:38:27.954
<v Speaker 3>pryor mountains and the crow Indians </v>
<v Speaker 3>raided his camp and chased off a bunch </v>

642
00:38:31.681 --> 00:38:34.590
<v Speaker 3>of those horses and they're now in those</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains and they,</v>

643
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:36.813
<v Speaker 3>this early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of a dorsal back striped zebra leg </v>

644
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
<v Speaker 3>look that probably came right from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Spanish horses of New Mexico.</v>

645
00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:48.840
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

646
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.220
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up into the northern West.</v>

647
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:52.540
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

648
00:38:52.541 --> 00:38:53.374
<v Speaker 3>the mass extinction event that took </v>
<v Speaker 3>place somewhere in the neighborhood of </v>

649
00:38:56.111 --> 00:38:58.510
<v Speaker 3>10,000 years ago that claimed the wooly </v>
<v Speaker 3>mammoth,</v>

650
00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.000
<v Speaker 3>saber tooth tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different animals.</v>

651
00:39:01.001 --> 00:39:01.834
<v Speaker 3>The horse was amongst that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that the horse was one of the ones </v>

652
00:39:04.151 --> 00:39:05.560
<v Speaker 3>that disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

653
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:06.423
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

654
00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I mean,</v>

655
00:39:08.291 --> 00:39:12.370
<v Speaker 3>we've got some pretty good explanations </v>
<v Speaker 3>for what happened to the mammoths.</v>

656
00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.293
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mammas probably a were taken out by </v>

657
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:17.644
<v Speaker 3>human hunters because this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was a version of the American west </v>

658
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.413
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that basically had emerged in the </v>

659
00:39:25.751 --> 00:39:27.780
<v Speaker 3>absence of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

660
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:30.700
<v Speaker 3>and we're just like every other mammal </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you mentioned a minute ago.</v>

661
00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:31.534
<v Speaker 3>You were amazed at the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves were able to spread around the </v>

662
00:39:33.851 --> 00:39:36.100
<v Speaker 3>world and the horses were able to spread</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the world.</v>

663
00:39:36.101 --> 00:39:37.150
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did the same thing.</v>

664
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.983
<v Speaker 3>We started in Africa and we spread </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the world getting the Europe </v>

665
00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:46.120
<v Speaker 3>about 45,000 years ago and didn't get to</v>
<v Speaker 3>North America,</v>

666
00:39:46.121 --> 00:39:46.954
<v Speaker 3>which was one of the last places except </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the islands out in the Pacific that </v>

667
00:39:50.201 --> 00:39:53.680
<v Speaker 3>humans got to until about 15,000 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

668
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:54.993
<v Speaker 3>And so when we arrive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we confronted a landscape that was full </v>

669
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:00.934
<v Speaker 3>of animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like mammoths that had no experience </v>

670
00:40:05.141 --> 00:40:05.974
<v Speaker 3>with human hunters at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we think is that these early </v>

671
00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:12.080
<v Speaker 3>arrivals from Siberia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

672
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.490
<v Speaker 3>we're probably really accomplished big </v>
<v Speaker 3>game hunters.</v>

673
00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:17.980
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all elephants,</v>

674
00:40:17.981 --> 00:40:20.920
<v Speaker 3>mammas had really long gestation </v>
<v Speaker 3>periods.</v>

675
00:40:20.921 --> 00:40:24.160
<v Speaker 3>It took them once they were impregnated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took them two years to have a calf.</v>

676
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:25.503
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they have a really to pregnant </v>

677
00:40:26.921 --> 00:40:27.700
<v Speaker 3>for two years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

678
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.533
<v Speaker 3>they're pregnant for two years and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>they have a really low population </v>

679
00:40:31.961 --> 00:40:32.794
<v Speaker 3>recovery ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a biologist call this a case species </v>

680
00:40:36.971 --> 00:40:39.820
<v Speaker 3>that have a kind of a low reproductive </v>
<v Speaker 3>rate.</v>

681
00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:43.510
<v Speaker 3>And so whenever humans arrive and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

682
00:40:43.511 --> 00:40:48.490
<v Speaker 3>and we take a look at the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I mean cow mammoths evidently were a</v>

683
00:40:48.491 --> 00:40:53.200
<v Speaker 3>lot easier to deal with in a hunt then </v>
<v Speaker 3>the big bulls were.</v>

684
00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:56.860
<v Speaker 3>And so these hunter seemed to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrated on cows.</v>

685
00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:02.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's of course obviously going </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be detrimental to the demographics of</v>

686
00:41:02.831 --> 00:41:07.100
<v Speaker 3>the population.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so probably in the case of mammoths,</v>

687
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:07.953
<v Speaker 3>it was human hunting of an animal that </v>
<v Speaker 3>had no prior experience with human </v>

688
00:41:12.371 --> 00:41:13.204
<v Speaker 3>hunters then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And not very many defenses against us </v>

689
00:41:14.951 --> 00:41:15.784
<v Speaker 3>that took them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other animals that have a lot of </v>

690
00:41:17.981 --> 00:41:18.814
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean some of the predators we think </v>

691
00:41:19.661 --> 00:41:23.140
<v Speaker 3>they went because of their prey species </v>
<v Speaker 3>disappeared.</v>

692
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:24.303
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amazing thing with the horses is </v>

693
00:41:27.311 --> 00:41:31.840
<v Speaker 3>just hard to fathom because we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>found very many sites.</v>

694
00:41:31.841 --> 00:41:36.841
<v Speaker 3>There was one recently near Boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado of what appeared to be on early</v>

695
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:39.680
<v Speaker 3>Indian kill of horses.</v>

696
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:41.263
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you tried to argue that the same </v>

697
00:41:42.891 --> 00:41:45.860
<v Speaker 3>thing happened with horses that happen </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the Mammas,</v>

698
00:41:45.861 --> 00:41:49.270
<v Speaker 3>she'd think you'd be finding kill sites </v>
<v Speaker 3>all over the place.</v>

699
00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.910
<v Speaker 3>It's not really found them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever looked into as this one of</v>

700
00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:53.744
<v Speaker 3>the animals?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's got the front paws got a little </v>

701
00:41:55.191 --> 00:41:57.350
<v Speaker 3>bit of zero strikes her front legs </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather.</v>

702
00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.030
<v Speaker 3>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying it's the back legs?</v>

703
00:41:59.060 --> 00:41:59.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's both,</v>

704
00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.370
<v Speaker 3>so I'll look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

705
00:42:01.371 --> 00:42:02.630
<v Speaker 3>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

706
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:04.760
<v Speaker 3>They had the zebra stripes on the legs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>

707
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:07.670
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is wild.</v>

708
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:11.370
<v Speaker 3>And they have this black stripe down the</v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

709
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:13.810
<v Speaker 3>The dorsal stripe is king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

710
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:14.913
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've read something about zebras that </v>

711
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:19.130
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

712
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:20.143
<v Speaker 3>that it makes it very hard for predators</v>
<v Speaker 3>to differentiate between individual </v>

713
00:42:23.291 --> 00:42:24.124
<v Speaker 3>zebras and that they had put an ear </v>
<v Speaker 3>collar or clip on one of the zebras and </v>

714
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:33.110
<v Speaker 3>immediately that Zebra was taken out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had singled that zebra out.</v>

715
00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.210
<v Speaker 3>It was very obvious to the predators </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

716
00:42:35.211 --> 00:42:37.100
<v Speaker 3>that was an individual and they went </v>
<v Speaker 3>right after it.</v>

717
00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:38.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

718
00:42:38.481 --> 00:42:39.314
<v Speaker 3>it could be something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I mean it's pretty clear from the </v>

719
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:45.133
<v Speaker 3>North American horses that the Zebra </v>
<v Speaker 3>striping trait originated here and then </v>

720
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:53.413
<v Speaker 3>ended up being taken by the animals that</v>
<v Speaker 3>migrated into Africa and perhaps </v>

721
00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:02.270
<v Speaker 3>elaborated on over time where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with,</v>

722
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:07.070
<v Speaker 3>with lions and Cheetahs and leopards and</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

723
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.820
<v Speaker 3>And they handled lion in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

724
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:12.160
<v Speaker 3>We had lauren time that was even bigger </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the African lions,</v>

725
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:13.220
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Panthera,</v>

726
00:43:13.221 --> 00:43:17.780
<v Speaker 3>the step line was a line that was one </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a half times the size of,</v>

727
00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.330
<v Speaker 3>of the African Lion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we had a,</v>

728
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:24.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a short face bear that was probably even</v>

729
00:43:24.621 --> 00:43:28.370
<v Speaker 3>more ferocious than modern day grizzlies</v>
<v Speaker 3>for one thing.</v>

730
00:43:28.371 --> 00:43:31.670
<v Speaker 3>It seems to have been a this really </v>
<v Speaker 3>gracile animal.</v>

731
00:43:31.671 --> 00:43:36.671
<v Speaker 3>It looked far more nimble and fast and </v>
<v Speaker 3>its ability to run and so forth.</v>

732
00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.190
<v Speaker 3>Then Grizzlies do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

733
00:43:40.191 --> 00:43:41.024
<v Speaker 3>We've talked about that thing many times</v>
<v Speaker 3>since I heard you talk about and we </v>

734
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:46.640
<v Speaker 3>pulled up pictures of it and the size of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things and the length of the legs.</v>

735
00:43:46.641 --> 00:43:47.474
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I looked at.</v>

736
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:52.190
<v Speaker 3>It's a huge animal that's a huge animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was bigger than a polar bear,</v>

737
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:53.420
<v Speaker 3>so I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's A.</v>

738
00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:57.890
<v Speaker 3>There's a Canadian biologist named </v>
<v Speaker 3>hilarious guys who has argued for a long</v>

739
00:43:57.891 --> 00:44:02.300
<v Speaker 3>time that he thinks until short faced </v>
<v Speaker 3>bears became extinct.</v>

740
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.950
<v Speaker 3>Humans were not able to actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>colonized North America,</v>

741
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:08.263
<v Speaker 3>that those things were so fearsome that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they basically kept Siberian hunters at </v>

742
00:44:13.161 --> 00:44:13.994
<v Speaker 3>bay on the other side of the bering land</v>
<v Speaker 3>bridge and finally when they began to </v>

743
00:44:18.231 --> 00:44:19.064
<v Speaker 3>disappear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then people begin trekking across and </v>

744
00:44:21.741 --> 00:44:23.720
<v Speaker 3>getting it in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

745
00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look like a monster.</v>

746
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:27.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't even look like a real animal.</v>

747
00:44:27.741 --> 00:44:28.574
<v Speaker 3>It looks like something in a movie and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then you see the short face and what is </v>

748
00:44:31.621 --> 00:44:32.454
<v Speaker 3>that next</v>

749
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.600
<v Speaker 4>day it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you say that?</v>

750
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:35.260
<v Speaker 4>Don Dale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don,</v>

751
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:38.340
<v Speaker 4>that's what do they call that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The hell pig?</v>

752
00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:40.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>

753
00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:42.000
<v Speaker 4>an animal even bigger than the short </v>
<v Speaker 4>face bear.</v>

754
00:44:42.001 --> 00:44:44.460
<v Speaker 4>So all these animals that existed in </v>
<v Speaker 4>North America,</v>

755
00:44:44.461 --> 00:44:47.730
<v Speaker 4>when did the short face bear go extinct?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The size of that thing.</v>

756
00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:49.590
<v Speaker 4>That's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

757
00:44:49.591 --> 00:44:51.390
<v Speaker 4>I think probably about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

758
00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:56.010
<v Speaker 4>about 14,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>15,000 years ago and as I said,</v>

759
00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:57.323
<v Speaker 4>at least one biologist argues that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>no coincidence that that's about the </v>

760
00:45:00.961 --> 00:45:04.730
<v Speaker 4>time that humans began showing up is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that once this bear is,</v>

761
00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:05.643
<v Speaker 4>has gone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it makes it possible for people to </v>

762
00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:10.840
<v Speaker 4>come into North America because they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>a hypothesis as to why that went extinct</v>

763
00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:13.060
<v Speaker 4>because of human intervention as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

764
00:45:13.061 --> 00:45:14.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what's happening,</v>

765
00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:15.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

766
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:19.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of pretty wild swings in</v>

767
00:45:19.171 --> 00:45:20.940
<v Speaker 4>climate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

768
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:22.883
<v Speaker 4>as a result of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the steady progression of ice ages and </v>

769
00:45:28.591 --> 00:45:30.130
<v Speaker 4>then water called,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

770
00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:31.163
<v Speaker 4>the Inter pluvial in between the ice </v>
<v Speaker 4>ages and the reason we think we have </v>

771
00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:38.243
<v Speaker 4>sort of a steady record of ice ages and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then a warming period in between and </v>

772
00:45:43.441 --> 00:45:44.970
<v Speaker 4>then a return to ice ages.</v>

773
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:45.803
<v Speaker 4>And warming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that goes back on the record for a </v>

774
00:45:47.071 --> 00:45:47.904
<v Speaker 4>very long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the earth actually doesn't spin </v>

775
00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:56.430
<v Speaker 4>a and a true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect spin on its axis.</v>

776
00:45:56.431 --> 00:46:01.080
<v Speaker 4>It has a wobble in it and sometimes when</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wobbles,</v>

777
00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:04.170
<v Speaker 4>this is called a procession of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>equinoxes.</v>

778
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.480
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's called the,</v>

779
00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:08.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the milankovitch cycles of a European.</v>

780
00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:12.510
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember if he was a geographer,</v>

781
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:13.763
<v Speaker 4>probably a geographer was the first to </v>
<v Speaker 4>speculate that this is why we have this </v>

782
00:46:18.121 --> 00:46:23.100
<v Speaker 4>climate history of a procession between </v>
<v Speaker 4>ice ages and pluvial is in between,</v>

783
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.970
<v Speaker 4>is because the earth wobbles and as it </v>
<v Speaker 4>wobbles,</v>

784
00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:28.163
<v Speaker 4>it will at certain times position the </v>
<v Speaker 4>northern hemisphere farther away from </v>

785
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:36.240
<v Speaker 4>the sun for a period of 30,</v>
<v Speaker 4>40,000 years.</v>

786
00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:40.470
<v Speaker 4>And during that wobble and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>position,</v>

787
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:42.660
<v Speaker 4>you get a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an ice age.</v>

788
00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:43.613
<v Speaker 4>And then the wobble,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll take it back so that the northern </v>

789
00:46:46.381 --> 00:46:48.690
<v Speaker 4>hemisphere begins to point more directly</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the sun.</v>

790
00:46:48.690 --> 00:46:51.010
<v Speaker 4>And in between you get what are called </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>

791
00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:54.540
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes quite warm episodes.</v>

792
00:46:54.541 --> 00:46:56.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had one about 5,000 years ago.</v>

793
00:46:56.431 --> 00:46:59.640
<v Speaker 4>That was probably six or seven or eight </v>
<v Speaker 4>degrees warmer than today.</v>

794
00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:04.110
<v Speaker 4>I would love to get you together with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy named Randall Carlson,</v>

795
00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:04.973
<v Speaker 4>who's an expert in astro asteroidal </v>
<v Speaker 4>impacts and he's got some pretty </v>

796
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.863
<v Speaker 4>compelling evidence and some fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 4>theories about the end of the ice age </v>

797
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:14.993
<v Speaker 4>and at the end of the ice age </v>
<v Speaker 4>corresponds to a lot of nuclear glass </v>

798
00:47:17.971 --> 00:47:18.804
<v Speaker 4>sites in Asia and Europe that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>nuclear glasses as essentially the same </v>

799
00:47:22.831 --> 00:47:24.870
<v Speaker 4>stuff they find doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do nuclear test sites.</v>

800
00:47:24.871 --> 00:47:25.704
<v Speaker 4>That also happens when they have media </v>
<v Speaker 4>impacts and it's all throughout and </v>

801
00:47:29.711 --> 00:47:30.220
<v Speaker 4>Europe</v>

802
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:33.460
<v Speaker 2>and he believes there was a significant </v>
<v Speaker 2>impact in North America.</v>

803
00:47:33.461 --> 00:47:38.461
<v Speaker 2>Not once but twice and it directly </v>
<v Speaker 2>corresponds to our,</v>

804
00:47:38.610 --> 00:47:42.520
<v Speaker 2>a planet passing through a essentially a</v>
<v Speaker 2>comet storm.</v>

805
00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Really fascinating stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's got this.</v>

806
00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.533
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to get you together with </v>

807
00:47:47.561 --> 00:47:51.070
<v Speaker 2>him because he's got some compelling </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence that he believes that the wooly</v>

808
00:47:51.071 --> 00:47:52.600
<v Speaker 2>mammoths and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it,</v>

809
00:47:52.601 --> 00:47:53.434
<v Speaker 2>60 something percent of the large </v>
<v Speaker 2>mammals that died off during that very </v>

810
00:47:57.101 --> 00:47:57.934
<v Speaker 2>distinct time period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says that directly corresponds to </v>

811
00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:03.580
<v Speaker 2>physical evidence of this trite night </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and all these,</v>

812
00:48:03.581 --> 00:48:04.414
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diamonds that they find micro diamonds </v>

813
00:48:06.131 --> 00:48:08.110
<v Speaker 2>that come from these impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very fascinating.</v>

814
00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 2>It is a possibility that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered</v>

815
00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:12.220
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

816
00:48:12.221 --> 00:48:14.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've read about it and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

817
00:48:14.261 --> 00:48:16.960
<v Speaker 3>as in so many questions out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

818
00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:20.980
<v Speaker 3>we haven't figured out the answers to </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and a lot of instances.</v>

819
00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.380
<v Speaker 3>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a possibility.</v>

820
00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:24.243
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was sort of leading to by </v>

821
00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:27.963
<v Speaker 3>tracking that milankovitch cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a procession through time is that that </v>

822
00:48:34.421 --> 00:48:35.254
<v Speaker 3>sort of changed tends to produce among </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal species and plants to really a </v>

823
00:48:40.961 --> 00:48:43.570
<v Speaker 3>lot of speciation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

824
00:48:43.571 --> 00:48:44.404
<v Speaker 3>it generates a lot of new because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>often isolating populations and when </v>

825
00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:51.670
<v Speaker 3>populations get isolated from their </v>
<v Speaker 3>parent populations,</v>

826
00:48:51.671 --> 00:48:55.510
<v Speaker 3>they'll evolve some new traits and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>even become a new species.</v>

827
00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:56.643
<v Speaker 3>And so you get a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a cycle where you end up </v>

828
00:49:00.311 --> 00:49:05.020
<v Speaker 3>with a lot of different new animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when change comes,</v>

829
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:08.590
<v Speaker 3>you often lose a good many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

830
00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:10.143
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these extinctions scenarios that are </v>

831
00:49:12.401 --> 00:49:13.234
<v Speaker 3>associated with the ice ages and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] in between the </v>

832
00:49:16.811 --> 00:49:18.790
<v Speaker 3>interglacials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

833
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:24.070
<v Speaker 3>do tend to produce quite a number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>extinctions.</v>

834
00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:29.430
<v Speaker 3>And the short face bear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I wish I was more of an expert so</v>

835
00:49:29.441 --> 00:49:32.620
<v Speaker 3>I could directly address exactly what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened to it.</v>

836
00:49:32.621 --> 00:49:37.621
<v Speaker 3>But all I can tell you from my limited </v>
<v Speaker 3>knowledge of it is that it seems to have</v>

837
00:49:37.721 --> 00:49:40.900
<v Speaker 3>disappeared in North America around </v>
<v Speaker 3>15,000 years ago.</v>

838
00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:45.960
<v Speaker 3>And that's at a time when the Wisconsin </v>
<v Speaker 3>ice age is beginning to wind down.</v>

839
00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:48.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>

840
00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we still haven't.</v>

841
00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:52.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of scholars out there,</v>

842
00:49:52.001 --> 00:49:52.834
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people out there who are </v>
<v Speaker 3>arguing climate as the primary </v>

843
00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.800
<v Speaker 3>explanation for the Pleistocene </v>
<v Speaker 3>extinctions.</v>

844
00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:02.710
<v Speaker 3>Most people sort of concede that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

845
00:50:02.711 --> 00:50:03.544
<v Speaker 3>in the case of the mammoths are evidence</v>
<v Speaker 3>tends to point more towards human </v>

846
00:50:08.081 --> 00:50:08.914
<v Speaker 3>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we don't know about all these other </v>

847
00:50:11.261 --> 00:50:12.880
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know why?</v>

848
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:14.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean the predators,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I said,</v>

849
00:50:14.681 --> 00:50:17.710
<v Speaker 3>they seem to disappear because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>prey disappears.</v>

850
00:50:17.711 --> 00:50:20.080
<v Speaker 3>But I mean one of the camels </v>
<v Speaker 3>disappeared.</v>

851
00:50:20.081 --> 00:50:21.940
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

852
00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:25.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these giant ground sloths disappear when</v>

853
00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:26.673
<v Speaker 3>the things that they ate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Globe mallows that are still in the </v>

854
00:50:29.931 --> 00:50:30.764
<v Speaker 3>West are still out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the animal that fed on them isn't </v>

855
00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:37.190
<v Speaker 3>there anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's something,</v>

856
00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:38.053
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people have been sort of a </v>

857
00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:40.963
<v Speaker 3>hammering around over beers and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>laboratories for actually more than a </v>

858
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:46.843
<v Speaker 3>century now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we still haven't answered all the </v>

859
00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:49.080
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is</v>

860
00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:50.163
<v Speaker 2>fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so amazing that you could even </v>

861
00:50:51.641 --> 00:50:55.330
<v Speaker 2>formulate that much information based on</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that was 25,</v>

862
00:50:55.331 --> 00:50:57.220
<v Speaker 2>15,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

863
00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:59.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole country that we,</v>

864
00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:04.210
<v Speaker 2>we live in today was for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as Europeans are concerned,</v>

865
00:51:04.211 --> 00:51:05.650
<v Speaker 2>we've only been here a few hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

866
00:51:05.651 --> 00:51:06.484
<v Speaker 2>which is really kind of amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only been here for a few hundred </v>

867
00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:09.250
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

868
00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:10.083
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

869
00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know from,</v>

870
00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:12.790
<v Speaker 3>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

871
00:51:12.791 --> 00:51:16.270
<v Speaker 3>the other recent book of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>American Serengeti,</v>

872
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:17.303
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the animals that you can observe </v>

873
00:51:21.521 --> 00:51:22.354
<v Speaker 3>today that gives us maybe our best sense</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what the Pleistocene is light is the </v>

874
00:51:26.741 --> 00:51:30.940
<v Speaker 3>pronghorn antelope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is still out on the plains.</v>

875
00:51:30.941 --> 00:51:31.774
<v Speaker 3>And of course across a lot of the west,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean natural where they nearly </v>

876
00:51:34.001 --> 00:51:36.550
<v Speaker 3>disappeared at the turn of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 3>century.</v>

877
00:51:36.551 --> 00:51:39.220
<v Speaker 3>We've managed to bring them back and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of western states,</v>

878
00:51:39.221 --> 00:51:40.054
<v Speaker 3>but that's an animal that is essentially</v>
<v Speaker 3>a holdover from the pleistocene and is </v>

879
00:51:46.781 --> 00:51:51.550
<v Speaker 3>kind of still fighting pleistocene </v>
<v Speaker 3>ghosts.</v>

880
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:52.503
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an animal is everybody knows that </v>

881
00:51:54.191 --> 00:51:58.750
<v Speaker 3>can run 65 miles an hour and yet for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>last 10,000 years,</v>

882
00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.153
<v Speaker 3>the fastest animal that can chase it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Gray Wolf only runs 45 miles an </v>

883
00:52:04.541 --> 00:52:05.374
<v Speaker 3>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that leads to the obvious </v>

884
00:52:07.271 --> 00:52:12.100
<v Speaker 3>question why the overkill in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>speed,</v>

885
00:52:12.101 --> 00:52:12.934
<v Speaker 3>what you would think is all you need to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do is run 47 miles an hour and you got </v>

886
00:52:17.291 --> 00:52:18.124
<v Speaker 3>it covered.</v>

887
00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:21.850
<v Speaker 3>But here are these animals still among </v>
<v Speaker 3>us that runs 65 miles an hour,</v>

888
00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:26.550
<v Speaker 3>that can't jump over fences that still </v>
<v Speaker 3>congregate and what,</v>

889
00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.473
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what people call the selfish herd where </v>

890
00:52:30.041 --> 00:52:30.874
<v Speaker 3>they'll group up as a herd of adults and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dominant animals will end up in the </v>

891
00:52:34.841 --> 00:52:37.480
<v Speaker 3>middle so that if there are any </v>
<v Speaker 3>predators,</v>

892
00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:42.280
<v Speaker 3>they get the ones on the edges and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominant ones survive.</v>

893
00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:48.120
<v Speaker 3>And yet they don't have any predators </v>
<v Speaker 3>except as fons.</v>

894
00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.073
<v Speaker 3>And so what we think is happening is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that in the pronghorn we've got an </v>

895
00:52:55.181 --> 00:52:56.014
<v Speaker 3>animal that has survived in our own time</v>
<v Speaker 3>that preserves how evolution shaped it </v>

896
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:09.970
<v Speaker 3>to deal with the predators of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pleistocene,</v>

897
00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:11.253
<v Speaker 3>when there actually was a cheetah and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>running hyena that could run almost 65 </v>

898
00:53:17.591 --> 00:53:18.424
<v Speaker 3>miles an hour and there were predators </v>
<v Speaker 3>that went after their herds when they </v>

899
00:53:23.471 --> 00:53:27.450
<v Speaker 3>were adults,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and all those animals have disappeared.</v>

900
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.313
<v Speaker 3>They're all ghosts and have been for </v>
<v Speaker 3>10,000 years and yet pronghorn still </v>

901
00:53:32.701 --> 00:53:33.534
<v Speaker 3>preserve the ability to run away from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cheetah and two group up as a selfish </v>

902
00:53:38.401 --> 00:53:42.480
<v Speaker 3>herd and preserve the dominant animals </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the middle against the hyena attack.</v>

903
00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:46.290
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea they could run that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can run 65 miles an hour.</v>

904
00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:47.183
<v Speaker 3>I only think some of the females which </v>
<v Speaker 3>are a little bit lighter than the males </v>

905
00:53:51.751 --> 00:53:56.500
<v Speaker 3>are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them may be able to run 70 magic</v>

906
00:53:57.550 --> 00:53:59.150
<v Speaker 3>going on the highway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>

907
00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:02.520
<v Speaker 3>You're violating the speed limit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a pronghorn process is.</v>

908
00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:03.373
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

909
00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.053
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not know that there was hyenas </v>

910
00:54:08.220 --> 00:54:11.160
<v Speaker 3>that lived in North America as well that</v>
<v Speaker 3>could run that fast.</v>

911
00:54:11.161 --> 00:54:12.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a fast,</v>

912
00:54:12.430 --> 00:54:15.620
<v Speaker 3>a running hyena that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

913
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:18.900
<v Speaker 3>was a major Predator of creatures like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

914
00:54:18.930 --> 00:54:19.501
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

915
00:54:19.501 --> 00:54:21.030
<v Speaker 3>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you know,</v>

916
00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:24.690
<v Speaker 3>and this is why I use the term American </v>
<v Speaker 3>Serengeti for the title of this book,</v>

917
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:29.910
<v Speaker 3>what we had in North America where these</v>
<v Speaker 3>versions.</v>

918
00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:30.931
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On the.</v>

919
00:54:30.931 --> 00:54:31.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

920
00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:32.183
<v Speaker 3>we've got a video of them right now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just someone's driving in the car and </v>

921
00:54:35.101 --> 00:54:37.810
<v Speaker 3>they are just flying by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

922
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Merriweather Lewis famously said </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

923
00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:41.723
<v Speaker 3>they're running motion more resembles </v>
<v Speaker 3>the flight of birds than it does any </v>

924
00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:47.040
<v Speaker 3>mammal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

925
00:54:47.041 --> 00:54:47.874
<v Speaker 3>I've seen them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw them in Montana and boy did they </v>

926
00:54:49.741 --> 00:54:52.230
<v Speaker 3>book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Kinda crazy to watch in real life.</v>

927
00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:54.870
<v Speaker 3>We'll see him take off when they get </v>
<v Speaker 3>spooked and you're like,</v>

928
00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:57.060
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are version of,</v>

929
00:54:57.110 --> 00:55:00.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>impalas and gazelles and in Africa.</v>

930
00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:04.380
<v Speaker 3>And so what other aunt there was this </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cheetah now?</v>

931
00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:06.900
<v Speaker 3>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it resemble the African Cheetah?</v>

932
00:55:06.901 --> 00:55:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Was it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did it looked like an African Cheetah?</v>

933
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:10.440
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it did.</v>

934
00:55:10.441 --> 00:55:11.570
<v Speaker 3>Resemble it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

935
00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:14.220
<v Speaker 3>as a result of kind of convergent </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolution.</v>

936
00:55:14.221 --> 00:55:14.601
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

937
00:55:14.601 --> 00:55:15.434
<v Speaker 3>it was an animal that pursued these </v>
<v Speaker 3>pronghorns that could run 70 miles an </v>

938
00:55:20.551 --> 00:55:23.220
<v Speaker 3>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it had to be able to run that fast.</v>

939
00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:25.530
<v Speaker 3>Did it develop independently of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>African Cheetah?</v>

940
00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:26.423
<v Speaker 3>It did end date.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact it developed from the </v>

941
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:32.370
<v Speaker 3>Cougar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mountain lion line.</v>

942
00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:36.670
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't come out of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

943
00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:37.533
<v Speaker 3>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Cheetah is a cat that famously many </v>

944
00:55:41.101 --> 00:55:44.060
<v Speaker 3>people say it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a dog gleick cat,</v>

945
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.593
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

946
00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:50.600
<v Speaker 3>its own independent entity in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so our version of it came out of the</v>

947
00:55:53.341 --> 00:55:58.341
<v Speaker 3>same line that produced mountain lions </v>
<v Speaker 3>except Mountain Lions 15,000,</v>

948
00:55:59.461 --> 00:56:00.294
<v Speaker 3>20,000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Produced this very fast running version </v>

949
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:07.890
<v Speaker 3>that was in effect an American Cheetah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

950
00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:11.520
<v Speaker 3>And did it have the same sort of front </v>
<v Speaker 3>paws as a cheetah?</v>

951
00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:13.380
<v Speaker 3>Cause Cheetah's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're more,</v>

952
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.660
<v Speaker 3>almost dogleg this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

953
00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:19.830
<v Speaker 3>this North American animal didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>dog like pads,</v>

954
00:56:19.831 --> 00:56:23.140
<v Speaker 3>like the African Cheetah does a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least I'm not,</v>

955
00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:24.003
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there may be some cheetah are our North </v>

956
00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:26.950
<v Speaker 3>American cheese expert out there who </v>
<v Speaker 3>would,</v>

957
00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.560
<v Speaker 3>who would contest that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I don't think so.</v>

958
00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:32.650
<v Speaker 3>I've not seen any evidence anywhere in </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything I've read that it did.</v>

959
00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:34.070
<v Speaker 3>So it essentially just develop</v>

960
00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.670
<v Speaker 2>disability to run very fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to catch pronghorn</v>

961
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:39.060
<v Speaker 3>to catch pronghorns and catch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

962
00:56:39.061 --> 00:56:41.010
<v Speaker 3>And there were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were other animals that could run,</v>

963
00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horses run pretty fast,</v>

964
00:56:43.081 --> 00:56:44.350
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

965
00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:47.580
<v Speaker 3>and cats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the reason horses buck of course,</v>

966
00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:52.390
<v Speaker 3>which we translated in our own time into</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rodeo sports,</v>

967
00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:54.053
<v Speaker 3>but the reason they buck is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's their strategy for dislodging a </v>

968
00:56:58.711 --> 00:57:03.711
<v Speaker 3>cat attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were always a pray of cats.</v>

969
00:57:04.530 --> 00:57:06.480
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

970
00:57:06.481 --> 00:57:07.201
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

971
00:57:07.201 --> 00:57:08.970
<v Speaker 3>when we were talking about horses a </v>
<v Speaker 3>minute ago,</v>

972
00:57:08.971 --> 00:57:10.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the points I was going to make,</v>

973
00:57:10.471 --> 00:57:11.304
<v Speaker 3>and I can make this point too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that one of the reasons horses </v>

974
00:57:14.071 --> 00:57:16.950
<v Speaker 3>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>horses are an issue now.</v>

975
00:57:16.980 --> 00:57:21.980
<v Speaker 3>And a problem in the West is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not on the great plains anymore,</v>

976
00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:28.730
<v Speaker 3>which was the primary horse range during</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 17 hundreds and 18 hundreds there in</v>

977
00:57:30.991 --> 00:57:33.780
<v Speaker 3>the deserts of places like Nevada.</v>

978
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:37.560
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're in a much more arid country,</v>

979
00:57:37.561 --> 00:57:40.690
<v Speaker 3>not in a lushly grass plains setting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a,</v>

980
00:57:40.691 --> 00:57:45.660
<v Speaker 3>in a desert setting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we don't have their predators around</v>

981
00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:47.120
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

982
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:51.810
<v Speaker 3>we've taken out gray wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which certainly did pray on colts.</v>

983
00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:53.213
<v Speaker 3>We've almost wiped out mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're meant lines are coming back and </v>

984
00:57:57.211 --> 00:58:00.960
<v Speaker 3>that's was always one of the major </v>
<v Speaker 3>predators of cults,</v>

985
00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:02.453
<v Speaker 3>but horses don't have the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>predators anymore that they had during </v>

986
00:58:06.691 --> 00:58:11.370
<v Speaker 3>the pleistocene or even in the 17 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds and 18 hundreds.</v>

987
00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:16.650
<v Speaker 3>And so without their predators on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>landscape and also being out in a desert</v>

988
00:58:16.651 --> 00:58:20.280
<v Speaker 3>setting rather than out in the much </v>
<v Speaker 3>lusher great plains.</v>

989
00:58:20.281 --> 00:58:21.300
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

990
00:58:21.301 --> 00:58:26.301
<v Speaker 3>they've become an issue in terms of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they compete with cattle,</v>

991
00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:28.013
<v Speaker 3>how they compete with sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they compete with mule deer and </v>

992
00:58:30.481 --> 00:58:33.450
<v Speaker 3>wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why we were sort of endlessly</v>

993
00:58:33.451 --> 00:58:35.910
<v Speaker 3>rattling the cage around wild horses </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

994
00:58:36.570 --> 00:58:40.710
<v Speaker 3>But in the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the 18 hundreds,</v>

995
00:58:40.711 --> 00:58:44.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were they were out on the great plains.</v>

996
00:58:44.521 --> 00:58:45.354
<v Speaker 3>They were in eastern Montana and eastern</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colorado and eastern New Mexico in this </v>

997
00:58:49.741 --> 00:58:52.750
<v Speaker 3>much more lushly grasp setting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're,</v>

998
00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:53.613
<v Speaker 3>of course still were wolves and mountain</v>
<v Speaker 3>lions to take out the colts and sort of </v>

999
00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:59.490
<v Speaker 3>keep their population suppressed them,</v>

1000
00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:01.080
<v Speaker 2>it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1001
00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:01.943
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm incredulous that human beings that </v>

1002
00:59:03.721 --> 00:59:06.120
<v Speaker 2>didn't even have bows and arrows could </v>
<v Speaker 2>kill off the woolly mammoth.</v>

1003
00:59:06.121 --> 00:59:10.380
<v Speaker 2>But then you stop and think about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are able to do in the few hundred</v>

1004
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:13.410
<v Speaker 2>years that we've been here when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrived in North America,</v>

1005
00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.273
<v Speaker 2>when Europeans arrived in North America </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just essentially swept through the </v>

1006
00:59:16.921 --> 00:59:20.970
<v Speaker 2>country and almost extra painted </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

1007
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Found like white</v>

1008
00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:24.080
<v Speaker 3>tail deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>antelope,</v>

1009
00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:24.943
<v Speaker 3>Buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We almost wiped the whole thing of elk </v>

1010
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:30.230
<v Speaker 3>when we got it down to just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1011
00:59:30.231 --> 00:59:33.230
<v Speaker 3>at the turn of the 19th century or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>20th century,</v>

1012
00:59:33.231 --> 00:59:34.730
<v Speaker 3>rather we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a,</v>

1013
00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:38.210
<v Speaker 3>it was a sad state and it was a sad </v>
<v Speaker 3>state and it was a,</v>

1014
00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:39.913
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those instances in history </v>

1015
00:59:41.301 --> 00:59:42.620
<v Speaker 3>where a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1016
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:45.740
<v Speaker 3>I think I say this in the introduction </v>
<v Speaker 3>of that American Serengeti Book,</v>

1017
00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:51.240
<v Speaker 3>that that was the largest destruction of</v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife that I've been able to discover</v>

1018
00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:59.380
<v Speaker 3>in world history when Europeans came to </v>
<v Speaker 3>North America and proceeded,</v>

1019
00:59:59.421 --> 01:00:00.254
<v Speaker 3>as you've just described from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific and </v>

1020
01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:10.060
<v Speaker 3>essentially wiped out just dozens of </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal species in most instances.</v>

1021
01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:13.994
<v Speaker 3>Not completely a exterminating them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but dropping them to numbers that were </v>

1022
01:00:19.821 --> 01:00:20.654
<v Speaker 3>so low that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you worried that this animal was gonna </v>

1023
01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:26.510
<v Speaker 3>survive and I mean some animals.</v>

1024
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:29.330
<v Speaker 3>We did go extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Carolina parakeet,</v>

1025
01:00:29.331 --> 01:00:31.040
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1026
01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:36.070
<v Speaker 3>was this beautiful Gadi Green and </v>
<v Speaker 3>yellow,</v>

1027
01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:37.513
<v Speaker 3>large cro sized parrot that was in North</v>
<v Speaker 3>America all the way up to the great </v>

1028
01:00:42.231 --> 01:00:47.231
<v Speaker 3>lakes and they became extinct by the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 3>thirties people hunted them.</v>

1029
01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:48.793
<v Speaker 3>They were regarded as a agricultural </v>
<v Speaker 3>pest and so farmers basically killed </v>

1030
01:00:53.931 --> 01:00:54.764
<v Speaker 3>them and enlisted government agents as </v>
<v Speaker 3>had happened with wolves and coyotes to </v>

1031
01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:00.723
<v Speaker 3>their wiped them out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating and I guess it makes </v>

1032
01:01:03.081 --> 01:01:03.914
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just fascinating that just a </v>

1033
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:08.270
<v Speaker 3>few hundred years ago they lacked the </v>
<v Speaker 3>foresight to understand that any sort of</v>

1034
01:01:08.271 --> 01:01:10.730
<v Speaker 3>intrusion into the ecosystem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any sort of,</v>

1035
01:01:10.731 --> 01:01:11.564
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eliminating one Predator or taking out </v>

1036
01:01:13.401 --> 01:01:17.720
<v Speaker 3>one thing causes a cascade of events </v>
<v Speaker 3>that can be disastrous.</v>

1037
01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:19.483
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People didn't know anything about </v>

1038
01:01:20.121 --> 01:01:21.050
<v Speaker 3>ecology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1039
01:01:21.051 --> 01:01:21.884
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have a emerge as a science </v>

1040
01:01:23.391 --> 01:01:26.810
<v Speaker 3>until the 18 sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It may make sense,</v>

1041
01:01:26.811 --> 01:01:27.644
<v Speaker 3>but it's amazing.</v>

1042
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:30.140
<v Speaker 3>It really is amazing and it knew so </v>
<v Speaker 3>little.</v>

1043
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:34.370
<v Speaker 3>We knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we knew very little and we tended to,</v>

1044
01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:35.663
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in with a complete lack of </v>

1045
01:01:37.851 --> 01:01:38.684
<v Speaker 3>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we did the same thing with the </v>

1046
01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:45.230
<v Speaker 3>coyote attempt at exterminating them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

1047
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:50.410
<v Speaker 3>we pass a law in Congress in 1931 to </v>
<v Speaker 3>provide for the extermination of coyotes</v>

1048
01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:53.294
<v Speaker 3>into appropriate the money to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we spent probably $100,000,000 </v>

1049
01:01:56.661 --> 01:01:57.494
<v Speaker 3>over the next 40 or 50 years attempting </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do it and pass that law at a time </v>

1050
01:02:03.021 --> 01:02:08.021
<v Speaker 3>when we'd never sent the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists out to do any study of coyote</v>

1051
01:02:08.961 --> 01:02:11.620
<v Speaker 3>national history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had no idea what they ate,</v>

1052
01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:12.973
<v Speaker 3>had no clue about them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but before we even have any science to </v>

1053
01:02:16.611 --> 01:02:19.590
<v Speaker 3>go on at all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just go ahead and take step up.</v>

1054
01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:20.453
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to.</v>

1055
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:21.413
<v Speaker 3>This is an ammo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're to completely weed out of the </v>

1056
01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:26.400
<v Speaker 3>North American setting.</v>

1057
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.310
<v Speaker 3>We're going to eliminate it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know a damn thing about it,</v>

1058
01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:30.203
<v Speaker 3>but we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make sure that this thing does not </v>

1059
01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:36.420
<v Speaker 3>survive through the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating in your book,</v>

1060
01:02:36.421 --> 01:02:39.510
<v Speaker 3>the accounts of the early explorers who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are trying to figure out what the hell a</v>

1061
01:02:39.511 --> 01:02:42.480
<v Speaker 3>coyote was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They thought maybe it was a jackal.</v>

1062
01:02:42.481 --> 01:02:43.314
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they finally decided it was </v>

1063
01:02:45.601 --> 01:02:49.110
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a small wolf and in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>initial description of it,</v>

1064
01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.450
<v Speaker 3>where they call it a prairie wolfe </v>
<v Speaker 3>prairie wolf.</v>

1065
01:02:51.451 --> 01:02:52.180
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1066
01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:55.680
<v Speaker 3>fine in a lot of people don't know this </v>
<v Speaker 3>for most of the 19th century.</v>

1067
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:56.813
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen references to this name as </v>

1068
01:02:59.101 --> 01:03:04.101
<v Speaker 3>late as 1915 Americans call coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pray Wolf's.</v>

1069
01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:07.470
<v Speaker 3>That was the name Lewis and Clark gave </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1070
01:03:07.471 --> 01:03:09.540
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what everybody called </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1071
01:03:09.541 --> 01:03:13.230
<v Speaker 3>And it wasn't until we started getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>out into the southwest,</v>

1072
01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:14.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the 18,</v>

1073
01:03:14.821 --> 01:03:15.654
<v Speaker 3>40 [inaudible] and 18 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially around Santa fe where there </v>

1074
01:03:20.131 --> 01:03:20.964
<v Speaker 3>were Indian people who had come up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Spanish colonization of the </v>

1075
01:03:26.971 --> 01:03:31.050
<v Speaker 3>southwest who spoke the language of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Aztecs.</v>

1076
01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.233
<v Speaker 3>That language is called know what and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the word coyote comes from the Aztec </v>

1077
01:03:39.001 --> 01:03:39.834
<v Speaker 3>language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when Americans were first getting </v>

1078
01:03:43.171 --> 01:03:44.004
<v Speaker 3>into New Mexico in the 1840 [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>really they began encountering people </v>

1079
01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:51.900
<v Speaker 3>who are using a different name for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal.</v>

1080
01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:53.213
<v Speaker 3>And over the next 30 or 40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that name sort of overtook the term </v>

1081
01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:02.580
<v Speaker 3>prairie wolf and finally completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>replaced it.</v>

1082
01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:06.000
<v Speaker 3>So the original name was an Aztec name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1083
01:04:06.001 --> 01:04:07.950
<v Speaker 3>It was an asset name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1084
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.430
<v Speaker 3>And it's pronounced and in the know Hwat</v>
<v Speaker 3>language,</v>

1085
01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:16.460
<v Speaker 3>it's spelled and their language c o y o </v>
<v Speaker 3>t t l,</v>

1086
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.233
<v Speaker 3>but the l on the end is silent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so the way they pronounced it was </v>

1087
01:04:23.311 --> 01:04:26.000
<v Speaker 3>quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1088
01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.570
<v Speaker 3>I mean the Aztec language because they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1089
01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:29.413
<v Speaker 3>they were an empire and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they defeated a lot of peoples and they </v>

1090
01:04:32.791 --> 01:04:36.300
<v Speaker 3>imposed their language and their customs</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a lot of people.</v>

1091
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.553
<v Speaker 3>There were all sorts of Indians who </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't necessarily as check who spoke </v>

1092
01:04:39.841 --> 01:04:41.670
<v Speaker 3>that language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1093
01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:42.533
<v Speaker 3>and there were evidently a enough of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them in places like Santa Fe in Tucson </v>

1094
01:04:47.041 --> 01:04:50.220
<v Speaker 3>that when a Anglo Americans got out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1095
01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:51.083
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were encountering not only native </v>

1096
01:04:53.941 --> 01:04:54.774
<v Speaker 3>people who were using that word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Spanish not being privy to the </v>

1097
01:04:59.581 --> 01:05:00.414
<v Speaker 3>American use of the term prairie wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Spanish had just adopted the Indian </v>

1098
01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:08.550
<v Speaker 3>name for the animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they had hispanicized it.</v>

1099
01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:11.490
<v Speaker 3>And they began,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they gave it an extra syllable.</v>

1100
01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:12.324
<v Speaker 3>So they call the animal a coil pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what these early Americans </v>

1101
01:05:18.131 --> 01:05:18.964
<v Speaker 3>were hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were largely hearing the Spanish </v>

1102
01:05:20.891 --> 01:05:23.440
<v Speaker 3>pronunciation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the three syllable version,</v>

1103
01:05:23.441 --> 01:05:24.274
<v Speaker 3>Cota Ota and Mark Twain comes along and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 18 seventies and writes a very </v>

1104
01:05:28.271 --> 01:05:30.970
<v Speaker 3>famous book about the West roughing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

1105
01:05:30.971 --> 01:05:33.190
<v Speaker 3>he's America's most famous writer at the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1106
01:05:33.191 --> 01:05:37.510
<v Speaker 3>his book as best seller a and Mark </v>
<v Speaker 3>Twain,</v>

1107
01:05:37.511 --> 01:05:39.640
<v Speaker 3>not only kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we,</v>

1108
01:05:39.641 --> 01:05:41.320
<v Speaker 3>as you mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mentioned a minute ago,</v>

1109
01:05:41.321 --> 01:05:43.510
<v Speaker 3>we don't really know what to make of </v>
<v Speaker 3>these animals.</v>

1110
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:46.300
<v Speaker 3>Americans have never had an experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>with an animal like this,</v>

1111
01:05:46.301 --> 01:05:48.340
<v Speaker 3>so we don't know what to think about </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1112
01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.353
<v Speaker 3>Mark Twain is the one who provides us </v>
<v Speaker 3>with kind of a take on them as these </v>

1113
01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.233
<v Speaker 3>cowardly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despicable a little creatures that have </v>

1114
01:06:00.011 --> 01:06:01.450
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1115
01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:02.313
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>overgrown wolf skin and this is </v>

1116
01:06:03.991 --> 01:06:06.610
<v Speaker 3>despairing look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>

1117
01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.473
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

1118
01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:08.573
<v Speaker 3>they're such scoundrels in such </v>
<v Speaker 3>scavengers that a flea would desert one </v>

1119
01:06:14.291 --> 01:06:16.120
<v Speaker 3>for a philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1120
01:06:16.121 --> 01:06:17.350
<v Speaker 3>and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark Twain is humorous.</v>

1121
01:06:17.351 --> 01:06:21.970
<v Speaker 3>So he gets on this riff and he goes on </v>
<v Speaker 3>for like three pages in this vein,</v>

1122
01:06:21.971 --> 01:06:23.650
<v Speaker 3>so that by the time you end up reading </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1123
01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:26.350
<v Speaker 3>your basic conviction is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1124
01:06:26.351 --> 01:06:29.320
<v Speaker 3>this is a despicable creature that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>just breathing up good air.</v>

1125
01:06:29.321 --> 01:06:31.990
<v Speaker 3>So we should just get rid of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he does.</v>

1126
01:06:31.991 --> 01:06:35.050
<v Speaker 3>In the course of that book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell Americans how,</v>

1127
01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:38.020
<v Speaker 3>what the animal is called and how you </v>
<v Speaker 3>pronounce it.</v>

1128
01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:39.750
<v Speaker 3>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1129
01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:40.653
<v Speaker 3>in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this animal is called a coyote and he </v>

1130
01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:49.510
<v Speaker 3>spelled it out phonetically given us our</v>
<v Speaker 3>modern pronunciation of coyote.</v>

1131
01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Saw our modern pronunciation comes from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark Twain.</v>

1132
01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:52.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1133
01:06:52.450 --> 01:06:53.283
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the one who at least popularizes </v>

1134
01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:55.443
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody who read his book </v>

1135
01:06:57.311 --> 01:07:01.780
<v Speaker 3>basically kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a absorbed that pronunciation of</v>

1136
01:07:01.781 --> 01:07:04.000
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why did these native Americans have such</v>

1137
01:07:04.001 --> 01:07:04.834
<v Speaker 3>a great respect for the coyote?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what was it about that animal that </v>

1138
01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:10.720
<v Speaker 3>we created so many legends?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1139
01:07:10.721 --> 01:07:15.721
<v Speaker 3>that's a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as I argue in this book,</v>

1140
01:07:15.731 --> 01:07:16.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1141
01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:20.470
<v Speaker 3>What I try to do with Coyote America is </v>
<v Speaker 3>to tell the,</v>

1142
01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.393
<v Speaker 3>the biography of the animal from its </v>
<v Speaker 3>evolutionary origins through its </v>

1143
01:07:25.661 --> 01:07:28.320
<v Speaker 3>history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up until the present time when of course</v>

1144
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:30.760
<v Speaker 3>it's in everybody's backyard all over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the country.</v>

1145
01:07:30.761 --> 01:07:34.610
<v Speaker 3>And so we're all all dealing with it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>having to figure out what it is and,</v>

1146
01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:35.673
<v Speaker 3>and how you coexist with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's a real rollercoaster ride </v>

1147
01:07:39.310 --> 01:07:41.290
<v Speaker 3>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes,</v>

1148
01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:44.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a million years of its evolution,</v>

1149
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:46.343
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>confronting at certain times the return </v>

1150
01:07:51.521 --> 01:07:52.354
<v Speaker 3>of gray wolves to North America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which clearly don't like coyotes and </v>

1151
01:07:54.761 --> 01:07:55.594
<v Speaker 3>beat the crap out of them and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably influenced their evolutionary </v>

1152
01:07:59.261 --> 01:08:02.500
<v Speaker 3>direction into a smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more jackal like animal.</v>

1153
01:08:03.550 --> 01:08:06.850
<v Speaker 3>But then it also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has this story that's associated with</v>

1154
01:08:06.851 --> 01:08:11.530
<v Speaker 3>us when humans arrive in North America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1155
01:08:11.610 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 3>coyotes get this wonderful peer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It lasts like</v>

1156
01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:18.163
<v Speaker 4>14,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>500 years or something where native </v>

1157
01:08:22.821 --> 01:08:27.821
<v Speaker 4>people look at them and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the most intriguing animal on the</v>

1158
01:08:30.951 --> 01:08:33.980
<v Speaker 4>continent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's for one thing,</v>

1159
01:08:34.730 --> 01:08:36.440
<v Speaker 4>mammoths,</v>
<v Speaker 4>camels,</v>

1160
01:08:36.441 --> 01:08:37.274
<v Speaker 4>horses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these big charismatic animals are </v>

1161
01:08:39.561 --> 01:08:43.040
<v Speaker 4>dying out around us in the pleistocene </v>
<v Speaker 4>extinctions.</v>

1162
01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:47.900
<v Speaker 4>Somehow these little guys don't seem to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be perturbed by it.</v>

1163
01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:51.110
<v Speaker 4>They're surviving while all of these big</v>
<v Speaker 4>creatures,</v>

1164
01:08:51.111 --> 01:08:54.110
<v Speaker 4>these big impressive creatures are going</v>
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>

1165
01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:55.573
<v Speaker 4>And I think they also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least this is what I argue in the </v>

1166
01:08:58.791 --> 01:08:59.624
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they had this sense that a coyote is </v>

1167
01:09:03.651 --> 01:09:04.484
<v Speaker 4>live by their widths.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that provided them with a </v>

1168
01:09:08.331 --> 01:09:13.331
<v Speaker 4>model that they thought was valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I think living successfully,</v>

1169
01:09:14.631 --> 01:09:17.300
<v Speaker 4>because you're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1170
01:09:17.301 --> 01:09:20.660
<v Speaker 4>is that's a trait that humans in any </v>
<v Speaker 4>age,</v>

1171
01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.930
<v Speaker 4>including ours right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1172
01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.080
<v Speaker 4>could very well a follow and find to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

1173
01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:31.073
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1174
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:33.830
<v Speaker 4>an effective way to go about facing your</v>
<v Speaker 4>future.</v>

1175
01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:37.610
<v Speaker 4>So they see this animal is being </v>
<v Speaker 4>particularly smart,</v>

1176
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:40.760
<v Speaker 4>particularly adaptable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a survivor,</v>

1177
01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:42.313
<v Speaker 4>and because it was a social animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has pups the pups don't know how to </v>

1178
01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:48.913
<v Speaker 4>fend for themselves in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And coyotes have to teach the pups just </v>

1179
01:09:52.851 --> 01:09:56.660
<v Speaker 4>as humans do with their children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How to become full grown coyotes and how</v>

1180
01:09:56.661 --> 01:09:57.494
<v Speaker 4>to survive that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seemed to have a lot of traits that </v>

1181
01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:05.360
<v Speaker 4>people found familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so at some point in time,</v>

1182
01:10:05.361 --> 01:10:06.860
<v Speaker 4>and who knows when it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1183
01:10:06.861 --> 01:10:11.360
<v Speaker 4>it could have been 10,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they converted into Indian people in the</v>

1184
01:10:11.361 --> 01:10:13.160
<v Speaker 4>West everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Coyotes range,</v>

1185
01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:16.970
<v Speaker 4>convert this animal into one of their </v>
<v Speaker 4>principle,</v>

1186
01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:21.920
<v Speaker 4>God's their principal deities and make </v>
<v Speaker 4>it this sacred creature.</v>

1187
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:23.383
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have no reason to kill them or </v>

1188
01:10:25.071 --> 01:10:25.904
<v Speaker 4>harass them or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so instead they look at it as this </v>

1189
01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.860
<v Speaker 4>Avatar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this stand in for humans.</v>

1190
01:10:33.861 --> 01:10:38.060
<v Speaker 4>In the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>study it really closely and they proceed</v>

1191
01:10:38.061 --> 01:10:41.210
<v Speaker 4>to create this body of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of literature.</v>

1192
01:10:41.211 --> 01:10:44.150
<v Speaker 4>It's our oldest literature from North </v>
<v Speaker 4>America,</v>

1193
01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:45.683
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the form of oral stories that have </v>

1194
01:10:47.841 --> 01:10:51.290
<v Speaker 4>coyote as the central character,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not,</v>

1195
01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:54.530
<v Speaker 4>it's not the little coyote that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>trotting through your camp.</v>

1196
01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:55.753
<v Speaker 4>It's a coyote man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a character who stands on his hind </v>

1197
01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:00.464
<v Speaker 4>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He has pointed nose and he has direct </v>

1198
01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:02.924
<v Speaker 4>ears and he has a tail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's standing up and he personifies </v>

1199
01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:11.180
<v Speaker 4>all the traits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>both good and bad of human beings.</v>

1200
01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:14.230
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's</v>

1201
01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:15.163
<v Speaker 2>so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the way we look at coyotes </v>

1202
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:17.813
<v Speaker 2>today is this new sense and this past,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's directly attributed to </v>

1203
01:11:20.641 --> 01:11:21.540
<v Speaker 2>agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1204
01:11:21.541 --> 01:11:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Directly attributed to us having </v>
<v Speaker 2>livestock anywhere near them,</v>

1205
01:11:24.211 --> 01:11:27.840
<v Speaker 2>deciding we want them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at the Museum of natural</v>

1206
01:11:27.841 --> 01:11:29.460
<v Speaker 2>history in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was there,</v>

1207
01:11:29.461 --> 01:11:31.160
<v Speaker 2>I took a photo of it because it was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

1208
01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:34.050
<v Speaker 2>I put on my instagram there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the photo,</v>

1209
01:11:34.051 --> 01:11:36.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuffed coyote that they have there.</v>

1210
01:11:36.241 --> 01:11:38.430
<v Speaker 2>They have all these different animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have African animals,</v>

1211
01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:40.050
<v Speaker 2>they have gorillas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees,</v>

1212
01:11:40.051 --> 01:11:40.884
<v Speaker 2>all these different stuffed animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just sort of give you a sense of what </v>

1213
01:11:43.081 --> 01:11:43.914
<v Speaker 2>they would look like with this mock </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural environment that coyote is </v>

1214
01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:47.483
<v Speaker 2>natural environment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They show a porch and the coyote has a </v>

1215
01:11:49.891 --> 01:11:51.780
<v Speaker 2>cat in it's mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1216
01:11:51.781 --> 01:11:54.390
<v Speaker 2>this is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is this image right here.</v>

1217
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:58.620
<v Speaker 2>That is my photo that I took from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Museum of natural history.</v>

1218
01:11:59.460 --> 01:12:02.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the natural environment is a</v>

1219
01:12:02.881 --> 01:12:05.090
<v Speaker 2>porch with a cat in his mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1220
01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:08.160
<v Speaker 2>it's so bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's how human beings,</v>

1221
01:12:08.161 --> 01:12:11.760
<v Speaker 2>especially in and around La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>view them.</v>

1222
01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:12.594
<v Speaker 2>I know when I had my situation with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken before I started reading your </v>

1223
01:12:18.121 --> 01:12:19.830
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought about killing that coyote.</v>

1224
01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:21.210
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to kill that fucker.</v>

1225
01:12:21.211 --> 01:12:22.710
<v Speaker 2>He killed my chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to kill him.</v>

1226
01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.113
<v Speaker 2>Then I found out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe I'm pretty sure that it was a </v>

1227
01:12:26.131 --> 01:12:27.990
<v Speaker 2>female because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1228
01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.033
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this female kind of honey Dick my dog </v>

1229
01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:32.213
<v Speaker 2>into jumping the fence and efforting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>converting with her and that's how they </v>

1230
01:12:36.121 --> 01:12:39.450
<v Speaker 2>got the chickens because my dog's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a massive.</v>

1231
01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:42.690
<v Speaker 2>And he knocked over this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When chickens,</v>

1232
01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:44.620
<v Speaker 2>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1233
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.050
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they brewed.</v>

1234
01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.930
<v Speaker 2>Do you know about chickens brooding?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that?</v>

1235
01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:49.920
<v Speaker 2>My Dad had chickens in Louisiana.</v>

1236
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.180
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kind of,</v>

1237
01:12:51.181 --> 01:12:51.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1238
01:12:51.660 --> 01:12:54.600
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with him when I would go </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and visit.</v>

1239
01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:55.853
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came to know a little bit about </v>

1240
01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:58.920
<v Speaker 2>chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1241
01:12:59.070 --> 01:13:01.950
<v Speaker 2>people don't know what happens is </v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens think that their eggs,</v>

1242
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.903
<v Speaker 2>the only way the chickens have eggs </v>
<v Speaker 2>every day pretty much or sort of every </v>

1243
01:13:05.091 --> 01:13:06.060
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every few days.</v>

1244
01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.640
<v Speaker 2>And when they have an egg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1245
01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:09.533
<v Speaker 2>those eggs are non-viable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the reasons why </v>

1246
01:13:10.801 --> 01:13:13.290
<v Speaker 2>vegetarians can eat chicken eggs and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>protein from them.</v>

1247
01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.030
<v Speaker 2>You're not hurting anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have the eggs,</v>

1248
01:13:15.031 --> 01:13:18.510
<v Speaker 2>whether or not there's a chicken there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are any or not.</v>

1249
01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:19.643
<v Speaker 2>They always have the egg and it has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be fertilized by the rooster in order </v>

1250
01:13:23.641 --> 01:13:25.860
<v Speaker 2>for it to become a chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't figure that out,</v>

1251
01:13:25.861 --> 01:13:29.460
<v Speaker 2>so it was almost 40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my stupid head,</v>

1252
01:13:29.461 --> 01:13:30.031
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1253
01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:30.864
<v Speaker 2>the egg means there's a chicken and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there you just gotTa Cook it before it </v>

1254
01:13:33.211 --> 01:13:33.930
<v Speaker 2>becomes a chicken.</v>

1255
01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:35.670
<v Speaker 2>No stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>

1256
01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chicken sometimes are convinced that</v>

1257
01:13:39.301 --> 01:13:41.640
<v Speaker 2>these non viable eggs will become </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicks.</v>

1258
01:13:41.641 --> 01:13:45.840
<v Speaker 2>And so they sit on them and they start </v>
<v Speaker 2>plucking their feathers out and it takes</v>

1259
01:13:45.841 --> 01:13:46.674
<v Speaker 2>the entire cycle that an egg would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>viable and become a chick for them to </v>

1260
01:13:50.251 --> 01:13:53.040
<v Speaker 2>get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only way to stop them is to put them</v>

1261
01:13:53.041 --> 01:13:55.050
<v Speaker 2>on a perch and put them in a smaller </v>
<v Speaker 2>cage.</v>

1262
01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.510
<v Speaker 2>So we put them in a perch and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller cage,</v>

1263
01:13:57.511 --> 01:14:01.290
<v Speaker 2>we separate them from the chicken coop </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the coyote had figured this out,</v>

1264
01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:02.543
<v Speaker 2>that this chicken was by itself and </v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced the massive to knock the cage </v>

1265
01:14:06.671 --> 01:14:09.480
<v Speaker 2>over because it was too small to knock </v>
<v Speaker 2>this coop over.</v>

1266
01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:11.530
<v Speaker 2>But the master is 140 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1267
01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:12.010
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking</v>

1268
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.730
<v Speaker 4>take care of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knocks the coop down that coyote says</v>

1269
01:14:15.731 --> 01:14:16.564
<v Speaker 4>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Grabs the chicken and then jumps and </v>

1270
01:14:18.401 --> 01:14:20.830
<v Speaker 4>hops the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was talking to my neighbor about,</v>

1271
01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:21.730
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>

1272
01:14:21.731 --> 01:14:23.440
<v Speaker 4>I fucking hate coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

1273
01:14:23.441 --> 01:14:26.830
<v Speaker 4>do you like rats?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if you don't like rats,</v>

1274
01:14:26.831 --> 01:14:27.664
<v Speaker 4>you should thank the coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason why we're not infested with </v>

1275
01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:31.390
<v Speaker 4>rats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're in the hills.</v>

1276
01:14:31.391 --> 01:14:33.340
<v Speaker 4>When you're in the hills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>out here in California,</v>

1277
01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:36.040
<v Speaker 4>there's rats and rodents everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not,</v>

1278
01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:38.230
<v Speaker 4>and the reason why is because these </v>
<v Speaker 4>coyotes,</v>

1279
01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:40.293
<v Speaker 4>we make that mistake so often where we </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that we're smart and we're going </v>

1280
01:14:44.431 --> 01:14:48.010
<v Speaker 4>to eliminate one thing in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this system,</v>

1281
01:14:48.190 --> 01:14:49.450
<v Speaker 4>and it's gonna be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

1282
01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:52.480
<v Speaker 4>All we have to do is take out this </v>
<v Speaker 4>coyote and everything will be great,</v>

1283
01:14:52.481 --> 01:14:53.314
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have a rat infestation </v>

1284
01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:55.873
<v Speaker 4>and that's one of the things that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked about in your book about farmers </v>

1285
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:59.703
<v Speaker 4>who had chased off the coyotes and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>had rapid infestations and they were </v>

1286
01:15:04.421 --> 01:15:05.620
<v Speaker 4>praying for coyotes.</v>

1287
01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:08.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean this happens in a just over and </v>
<v Speaker 4>over and over again.</v>

1288
01:15:08.621 --> 01:15:09.454
<v Speaker 4>And so I think one of the reasons that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we tend to make endlessly make the same </v>

1289
01:15:13.991 --> 01:15:18.991
<v Speaker 4>mistake with animals like this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we don't try to spend any effort</v>

1290
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:20.583
<v Speaker 4>to understand the ecological world </v>
<v Speaker 4>around us and to understand their role </v>

1291
01:15:26.501 --> 01:15:28.990
<v Speaker 4>in it in particular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know what I mean?</v>

1292
01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:33.310
<v Speaker 4>I've been going around the country a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>over the last eight months talking about</v>

1293
01:15:33.311 --> 01:15:34.144
<v Speaker 4>this book because obviously everybody is</v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with them and some people are </v>

1294
01:15:37.151 --> 01:15:37.984
<v Speaker 4>brand new in dealing with them and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were alarmed first of all that there's </v>

1295
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:45.550
<v Speaker 4>this small wolf trotting down the street</v>
<v Speaker 4>or through their yard.</v>

1296
01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:47.620
<v Speaker 4>And then of course they immediately </v>
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1297
01:15:47.621 --> 01:15:48.454
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to get your cat scan to get </v>

1298
01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:52.960
<v Speaker 4>your small dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got a level to grab your three year</v>

1299
01:15:52.961 --> 01:15:53.350
<v Speaker 4>old.</v>

1300
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:56.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just saw the horror stories,</v>

1301
01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:57.373
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>through kind of urban legend make the </v>

1302
01:16:00.161 --> 01:16:01.390
<v Speaker 4>rounds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1303
01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:06.391
<v Speaker 4>at a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at an accelerated rate and sort of basic</v>

1304
01:16:07.330 --> 01:16:08.163
<v Speaker 4>good information about the animal </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't make the round very effectively </v>

1305
01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:13.030
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not fun.</v>

1306
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:14.470
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not fun.</v>

1307
01:16:14.471 --> 01:16:15.304
<v Speaker 4>But what you have to grapple with first </v>
<v Speaker 4>of all is you've got to start with a </v>

1308
01:16:19.271 --> 01:16:20.104
<v Speaker 4>position,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I'll admit this is not the </v>

1309
01:16:21.731 --> 01:16:26.620
<v Speaker 4>American position to take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the position that in this instance,</v>

1310
01:16:26.650 --> 01:16:31.390
<v Speaker 4>we have confronted a part of the natural</v>
<v Speaker 4>world that we are not able to control.</v>

1311
01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.760
<v Speaker 4>We can't control coyotes.</v>

1312
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:36.783
<v Speaker 4>We met resistance basically as futile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to be among us no matter </v>

1313
01:16:41.441 --> 01:16:43.030
<v Speaker 4>what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1314
01:16:43.031 --> 01:16:44.840
<v Speaker 4>you can certainly take out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1315
01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:45.813
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coyotes are individuals and so if </v>

1316
01:16:47.381 --> 01:16:50.680
<v Speaker 4>there's a bad actor in the neighborhood </v>
<v Speaker 4>and very few of them,</v>

1317
01:16:50.681 --> 01:16:55.180
<v Speaker 4>by the way in the studies of coyotes in </v>
<v Speaker 4>urban settings are bad actors,</v>

1318
01:16:55.181 --> 01:16:56.014
<v Speaker 4>but occasionally there's one that starts</v>
<v Speaker 4>catching cats are a starts chasing dogs </v>

1319
01:17:00.191 --> 01:17:01.024
<v Speaker 4>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can take that one out and </v>

1320
01:17:02.501 --> 01:17:03.334
<v Speaker 4>perhaps improve the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just blanket going after any coyote </v>

1321
01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:14.680
<v Speaker 4>you're afraid of something like your cat</v>
<v Speaker 4>might disappear is going to boomerang in</v>

1322
01:17:16.341 --> 01:17:17.174
<v Speaker 4>every instance because attempts to </v>
<v Speaker 4>persecute them as I try to point out </v>

1323
01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.313
<v Speaker 4>over and over and Coyote America result </v>
<v Speaker 4>in every case and more coyotes and and </v>

1324
01:17:27.491 --> 01:17:32.491
<v Speaker 4>it skews the populations so that what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you end up with are often youngsters,</v>

1325
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:33.403
<v Speaker 4>teenagers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that like human teenagers get in more </v>

1326
01:17:35.841 --> 01:17:37.880
<v Speaker 4>trouble than adults do.</v>

1327
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:39.343
<v Speaker 4>So the thing that I keep trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and of course there's a group in </v>

1328
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:44.683
<v Speaker 4>California and San Francisco called </v>
<v Speaker 4>project coyote that's been at this a </v>

1329
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:54.200
<v Speaker 4>trying to help people understand how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>coexist but coexist with coyotes for the</v>

1330
01:17:54.201 --> 01:17:58.250
<v Speaker 4>last seven or eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What you have to do is first of all,</v>

1331
01:17:58.251 --> 01:17:59.870
<v Speaker 4>accept the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1332
01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:02.300
<v Speaker 4>resistance is futile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These animals are here.</v>

1333
01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:04.940
<v Speaker 4>They know how to live in an urban </v>
<v Speaker 4>setting.</v>

1334
01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:06.920
<v Speaker 4>They know how to live in the hills </v>
<v Speaker 4>around me.</v>

1335
01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:12.280
<v Speaker 4>Now I've got to figure out how I live </v>
<v Speaker 4>with coyotes in my life.</v>

1336
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:14.683
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the obvious thing is you don't let your </v>

1337
01:18:17.511 --> 01:18:20.270
<v Speaker 4>cats out in the morning to go hunt </v>
<v Speaker 4>songbirds.</v>

1338
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:24.550
<v Speaker 4>You don't let your cats out at night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the coyotes are,</v>

1339
01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:25.573
<v Speaker 4>in most instances,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not attacking cats are small dogs </v>

1340
01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:34.121
<v Speaker 4>because they want to eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They regard them as competitor predators</v>

1341
01:18:34.611 --> 01:18:39.611
<v Speaker 4>in their territory and so they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>attacking them because that's how they.</v>

1342
01:18:39.810 --> 01:18:42.080
<v Speaker 4>They see them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they do eat them,</v>

1343
01:18:42.081 --> 01:18:42.570
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1344
01:18:42.570 --> 01:18:43.403
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will eat them in some instances </v>

1345
01:18:46.190 --> 01:18:49.250
<v Speaker 4>when they're trying to provision a </v>
<v Speaker 4>litter of pups.</v>

1346
01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:50.413
<v Speaker 4>So the times when cats will be snatched </v>
<v Speaker 4>by coyotes and will disappear and you </v>

1347
01:18:56.331 --> 01:18:57.164
<v Speaker 4>don't see the cat again is often the </v>
<v Speaker 4>period from basically about now from </v>

1348
01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:01.573
<v Speaker 4>April through about July,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when they have their litters and </v>

1349
01:19:05.391 --> 01:19:09.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's sometimes hard to come up </v>
<v Speaker 4>with enough protein to raise five or six</v>

1350
01:19:09.981 --> 01:19:13.640
<v Speaker 4>little coyote pups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so occasionally a cat or a small dog</v>

1351
01:19:13.641 --> 01:19:14.474
<v Speaker 4>will be taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But usually what happens with cats and </v>

1352
01:19:17.691 --> 01:19:20.570
<v Speaker 4>small dogs is that Kylie's attack them </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they just leave them there.</v>

1353
01:19:21.260 --> 01:19:23.780
<v Speaker 4>And I've told people for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1354
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:24.643
<v Speaker 4>for most of this year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is from my own experience </v>

1355
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.823
<v Speaker 4>because I've lived in the urban </v>
<v Speaker 4>wildlands interface for almost all my </v>

1356
01:19:30.711 --> 01:19:33.380
<v Speaker 4>adult life out in the countryside away </v>
<v Speaker 4>from town.</v>

1357
01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.113
<v Speaker 4>Whenever you find your cat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's probably a coyote and its attack </v>

1358
01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:44.810
<v Speaker 4>the cat because it thinks it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>competitor and it attacks,</v>

1359
01:19:44.811 --> 01:19:45.800
<v Speaker 4>it kills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It leaves it.</v>

1360
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:50.690
<v Speaker 4>If the animal disappears,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if your cat disappears and you never see</v>

1361
01:19:50.691 --> 01:19:51.524
<v Speaker 4>it again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>either that's happened in the time when </v>

1362
01:19:54.741 --> 01:19:59.660
<v Speaker 4>they're provisioning pups or if it </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens in the fall or the winter or the</v>

1363
01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:02.270
<v Speaker 4>early spring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And your cat totally disappears.</v>

1364
01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:05.430
<v Speaker 4>It probably was a great horned owl that </v>
<v Speaker 4>got your cat.</v>

1365
01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean als pluck</v>

1366
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:11.700
<v Speaker 2>cats and take them to their roost and </v>
<v Speaker 2>devour them.</v>

1367
01:20:11.701 --> 01:20:14.610
<v Speaker 2>And so your cat disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you never see it again.</v>

1368
01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:17.310
<v Speaker 2>But what almost everybody does now that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we know,</v>

1369
01:20:17.311 --> 01:20:20.490
<v Speaker 2>we've got coyotes as hear coyotes </v>
<v Speaker 2>howling and the hills,</v>

1370
01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:23.790
<v Speaker 2>the neighbor had a cat disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course it was a coyote.</v>

1371
01:20:24.090 --> 01:20:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Coyote got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1372
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:26.263
<v Speaker 2>But it might not be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say in a pretty sizeable </v>

1373
01:20:29.311 --> 01:20:30.144
<v Speaker 2>percentage of cases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was actually a great horned owl that </v>

1374
01:20:33.451 --> 01:20:34.284
<v Speaker 2>got the cat and not a coyote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a great video that I found </v>

1375
01:20:36.601 --> 01:20:37.434
<v Speaker 2>online that I put on my instagram of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>owl snatching some other raptor right </v>

1376
01:20:41.401 --> 01:20:42.960
<v Speaker 2>out of its nest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen it?</v>

1377
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:44.910
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1378
01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:49.560
<v Speaker 2>it's someone that had like a trail cam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a video up a black and white trail cam.</v>

1379
01:20:49.561 --> 01:20:50.394
<v Speaker 2>And you see the owl flying in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>distance or is it you see the eyes and </v>

1380
01:20:54.841 --> 01:20:55.674
<v Speaker 2>then you see it snap and the other bird </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the nest doesn't even know what </v>

1381
01:20:57.991 --> 01:20:59.340
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had watched this.</v>

1382
01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:01.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happened so fast.</v>

1383
01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.720
<v Speaker 2>So what first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know what kind of animal that is?</v>

1384
01:21:03.721 --> 01:21:05.010
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would that bird is?</v>

1385
01:21:05.130 --> 01:21:07.320
<v Speaker 2>Can you tell by looking at it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a hawk.</v>

1386
01:21:07.321 --> 01:21:10.380
<v Speaker 2>Have some fledgling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

1387
01:21:10.381 --> 01:21:11.214
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at the other ones like what </v>

1388
01:21:11.821 --> 01:21:14.340
<v Speaker 2>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>

1389
01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:15.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a hawk of some kind.</v>

1390
01:21:15.991 --> 01:21:16.824
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a red tail and the fledgling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the eyes and the distance are </v>

1391
01:21:19.651 --> 01:21:21.080
<v Speaker 2>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look through these eyes.</v>

1392
01:21:21.081 --> 01:21:22.370
<v Speaker 2>Sneaking up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>

1393
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:23.263
<v Speaker 2>Here it comes.</v>

1394
01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.170
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny that we think of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is.</v>

1395
01:21:28.171 --> 01:21:30.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh the wise old owl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give a hoot.</v>

1396
01:21:30.211 --> 01:21:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Don't pollute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

1397
01:21:31.861 --> 01:21:34.080
<v Speaker 2>those motherfuckers are as evil as it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets.</v>

1398
01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:35.093
<v Speaker 2>Well they are definitely major predators</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they hear the stories about them in </v>

1399
01:21:38.871 --> 01:21:40.480
<v Speaker 2>New Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there.</v>

1400
01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:41.363
<v Speaker 2>I've got friends who were sitting at a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at an outdoor bar a couple of years ago </v>

1401
01:21:45.391 --> 01:21:46.224
<v Speaker 2>with a railing on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a late afternoon and a cat was </v>

1402
01:21:48.361 --> 01:21:51.630
<v Speaker 2>walking along the railing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether sitting there with their drinks,</v>

1403
01:21:51.631 --> 01:21:52.464
<v Speaker 2>shooting the shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden an al comes in and </v>

1404
01:21:55.290 --> 01:21:56.123
<v Speaker 2>in a flash plucks that cat off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>railing and the next thing they say is </v>

1405
01:21:59.101 --> 01:21:59.934
<v Speaker 2>the owl flying off to the cottonwood </v>
<v Speaker 2>trees over the creek with this cat </v>

1406
01:22:02.911 --> 01:22:04.990
<v Speaker 2>dangling from its.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1407
01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:07.290
<v Speaker 2>while they're all sitting there with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their drinks,</v>

1408
01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:08.473
<v Speaker 2>poison in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was driving home one day and I saw </v>

1409
01:22:11.581 --> 01:22:14.370
<v Speaker 2>this hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll fly right above my head and I must</v>

1410
01:22:14.371 --> 01:22:15.204
<v Speaker 2>have apparently while I was driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must have got this rabbit somewhere </v>

1411
01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:20.934
<v Speaker 2>close to it and I startled it so it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>flying off and decided to drop the </v>

1412
01:22:24.151 --> 01:22:24.840
<v Speaker 2>rabbit.</v>

1413
01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:28.380
<v Speaker 2>So we're like right in front of me in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the highway or the road.</v>

1414
01:22:28.381 --> 01:22:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Was this eviscerated rabbit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1415
01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Big Rabbit too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was in that.</v>

1416
01:22:32.610 --> 01:22:34.980
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the first years that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>lived here.</v>

1417
01:22:35.130 --> 01:22:36.360
<v Speaker 2>And I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1418
01:22:36.361 --> 01:22:37.194
<v Speaker 2>I gotta read.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta recalibrate my idea when an owl </v>

1419
01:22:39.211 --> 01:22:40.044
<v Speaker 2>is getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it was just torn apart and it </v>

1420
01:22:41.971 --> 01:22:45.960
<v Speaker 2>was a big rabbit and I saw this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was a big owl too,</v>

1421
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:47.340
<v Speaker 2>so the whole thing was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1422
01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.330
<v Speaker 2>this is a predator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't just a bird icon.</v>

1423
01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:53.310
<v Speaker 2>They and that's the way they killed two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do with cats.</v>

1424
01:22:53.311 --> 01:22:55.470
<v Speaker 2>They eviscerate them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put a talent.</v>

1425
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:59.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm basically into their ass and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>rip it all the way up,</v>

1426
01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:03.270
<v Speaker 2>all the way up to their sternum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spilled their guts out.</v>

1427
01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:04.553
<v Speaker 2>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a wildlife near here and we </v>

1428
01:23:06.671 --> 01:23:07.504
<v Speaker 2>visited a couple of times and they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>owls there and you get to see them and </v>

1429
01:23:10.930 --> 01:23:11.763
<v Speaker 2>check them out up close like animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>that had been injured and things like </v>

1430
01:23:13.901 --> 01:23:14.110
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1431
01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:17.300
<v Speaker 2>And you just see the talents on those </v>
<v Speaker 2>suckers and just woof.</v>

1432
01:23:17.710 --> 01:23:18.760
<v Speaker 2>There's serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1433
01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:23.650
<v Speaker 2>It's fascinating how we anthropomorphize</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these animals and turn them into</v>

1434
01:23:23.651 --> 01:23:25.150
<v Speaker 2>these cutie pies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1435
01:23:25.151 --> 01:23:25.984
<v Speaker 2>like polar bears are selling Coca Cola </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Klondike bars and owls are selling </v>

1436
01:23:29.381 --> 01:23:32.350
<v Speaker 2>tootsie roll pops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We evolved it just they're out there,</v>

1437
01:23:32.351 --> 01:23:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Jack and cats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1438
01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:35.253
<v Speaker 2>there's a video in Los Angeles and one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the reasons why I wanted to ask you </v>

1439
01:23:38.621 --> 01:23:41.710
<v Speaker 2>about this is because I'd heard you say </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

1440
01:23:41.711 --> 01:23:46.390
<v Speaker 2>I think on Renell's podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you just said about cats and dogs,</v>

1441
01:23:46.391 --> 01:23:48.250
<v Speaker 2>that essentially they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coyotes,</v>

1442
01:23:48.251 --> 01:23:50.950
<v Speaker 2>think of them as competitive predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1443
01:23:51.370 --> 01:23:54.580
<v Speaker 2>But there's a video in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1444
01:23:54.850 --> 01:23:59.820
<v Speaker 2>in Hollywood have a coyote eating a cat </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a lawn and a,</v>

1445
01:23:59.890 --> 01:24:00.723
<v Speaker 2>these people are in the car watching and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're filming it and they're freaking </v>

1446
01:24:04.031 --> 01:24:04.331
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1447
01:24:04.331 --> 01:24:05.230
<v Speaker 2>oh my God.</v>

1448
01:24:05.230 --> 01:24:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Kylie was just sitting there eating</v>

1449
01:24:07.541 --> 01:24:08.374
<v Speaker 2>that cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think that the reason why it's </v>

1450
01:24:10.421 --> 01:24:12.830
<v Speaker 2>eating that music just hungry maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or is it,</v>

1451
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:13.723
<v Speaker 2>is it an occasional meal that they think</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them as prey or is it primarily </v>

1452
01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:19.863
<v Speaker 2>because they're a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 2>factors or is it primarily because </v>

1453
01:24:21.941 --> 01:24:23.710
<v Speaker 2>they're competitive predators?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1454
01:24:23.711 --> 01:24:27.100
<v Speaker 2>I think it's primarily because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean there are.</v>

1455
01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:28.770
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1456
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:32.500
<v Speaker 2>there's coyotes are so individualistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1457
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:35.090
<v Speaker 2>That's soccer hanging out right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1458
01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:36.580
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you?</v>

1459
01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Wild animal walking by the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in Los Angeles.</v>

1460
01:24:39.611 --> 01:24:40.444
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so bizarre that they're so </v>

1461
01:24:41.501 --> 01:24:45.650
<v Speaker 2>comfortable around people treat like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little city streets.</v>

1462
01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:47.890
<v Speaker 2>It's thinking about walking across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>street,</v>

1463
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:50.560
<v Speaker 2>don't know how to navigate the streets </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that too.</v>

1464
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:51.423
<v Speaker 2>So strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does it figure out how to make it </v>

1465
01:24:53.591 --> 01:24:54.670
<v Speaker 2>across the street?</v>

1466
01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

1467
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.903
<v Speaker 2>there's a biologist in Chicago who </v>
<v Speaker 2>argues that in rush hour traffic on the </v>

1468
01:25:01.061 --> 01:25:01.894
<v Speaker 2>interstate in Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>9 million people there that he's seen </v>

1469
01:25:04.541 --> 01:25:05.374
<v Speaker 2>coyotes cross four lanes of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interstate and stop in the median and </v>

1470
01:25:10.841 --> 01:25:15.640
<v Speaker 2>sit there and wait until the traffic </v>
<v Speaker 2>lightens up for the other four lanes and</v>

1471
01:25:15.641 --> 01:25:17.650
<v Speaker 2>then cross that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>

1472
01:25:17.651 --> 01:25:18.484
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the coyote goes and gets this cat that </v>

1473
01:25:21.281 --> 01:25:24.190
<v Speaker 2>apparently it had already killed before </v>
<v Speaker 2>he starts eating it.</v>

1474
01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:25.600
<v Speaker 2>So it's got it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1475
01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:28.510
<v Speaker 2>That thing at his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His cat.</v>

1476
01:25:28.570 --> 01:25:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1477
01:25:30.011 --> 01:25:33.160
<v Speaker 2>what I was going to say about that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that yeah,</v>

1478
01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:34.770
<v Speaker 2>it's all stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1479
01:25:34.810 --> 01:25:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Well he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what a strange animal.</v>

1480
01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:39.820
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1481
01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:43.420
<v Speaker 2>So two things I would observe about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular video is,</v>

1482
01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:45.890
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1483
01:25:45.970 --> 01:25:50.350
<v Speaker 2>everybody is making the assumption that </v>
<v Speaker 2>coyote killed the cat.</v>

1484
01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:55.990
<v Speaker 2>That cat may have been hit by a car and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the coyote founded in is scavenging it.</v>

1485
01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:57.570
<v Speaker 2>How about another stupid cat behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>

1486
01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:02.680
<v Speaker 2>That's my friend right behind the low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you eating my friend?</v>

1487
01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:06.433
<v Speaker 3>The other thing I would say is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so individualistic that </v>

1488
01:26:09.711 --> 01:26:12.680
<v Speaker 3>sometimes cats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they develop.</v>

1489
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:17.660
<v Speaker 3>A coyote is develop a yen for cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could taste.</v>

1490
01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:18.553
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they develop a taste for them and so I </v>

1491
01:26:19.701 --> 01:26:20.750
<v Speaker 3>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are examples.</v>

1492
01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:21.733
<v Speaker 3>There was a coyote pack in Seattle and </v>
<v Speaker 3>also one in Tucson that basically did </v>

1493
01:26:26.871 --> 01:26:28.100
<v Speaker 3>this very thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They.</v>

1494
01:26:28.670 --> 01:26:33.470
<v Speaker 3>They decided that cats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be their target now.</v>

1495
01:26:33.471 --> 01:26:35.210
<v Speaker 3>Most coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1496
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:36.103
<v Speaker 3>that's not how they react to cats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but cats do kill an unbelievable amount </v>

1497
01:26:41.091 --> 01:26:42.600
<v Speaker 3>of rodents and birds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1498
01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:44.660
<v Speaker 3>and people don't want to hear this of </v>
<v Speaker 3>course,</v>

1499
01:26:44.661 --> 01:26:48.680
<v Speaker 3>but the truth is that in all cities were</v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes have spread,</v>

1500
01:26:48.681 --> 01:26:49.514
<v Speaker 3>which is literally everywhere now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have from the ornithologists a </v>

1501
01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:55.813
<v Speaker 3>decided record of numbers of nesting </v>
<v Speaker 3>songbirds going up dramatically as a </v>

1502
01:27:00.771 --> 01:27:03.080
<v Speaker 3>result of the appearance of coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1503
01:27:03.081 --> 01:27:07.760
<v Speaker 3>There was a statistic that we quoted on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the podcast and it's something insane,</v>

1504
01:27:07.761 --> 01:27:12.761
<v Speaker 3>like 3 billion birds a year in North </v>
<v Speaker 3>America alone are killed by cats,</v>

1505
01:27:14.571 --> 01:27:18.050
<v Speaker 3>by house cats b with a b.</v>

1506
01:27:18.130 --> 01:27:19.490
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you tell that to people,</v>

1507
01:27:19.491 --> 01:27:20.570
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no way,</v>

1508
01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:22.340
<v Speaker 3>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are biologists.</v>

1509
01:27:22.341 --> 01:27:23.900
<v Speaker 3>These are people that are actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>studying this,</v>

1510
01:27:23.901 --> 01:27:26.410
<v Speaker 3>and it blew them away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how they studied it.</v>

1511
01:27:26.411 --> 01:27:27.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you could enlighten me.</v>

1512
01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:28.491
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't either.</v>

1513
01:27:28.491 --> 01:27:30.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one point 7 billion years annually,</v>

1514
01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:34.880
<v Speaker 3>seven birds in the continental us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is so crazy.</v>

1515
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:36.500
<v Speaker 3>That's us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not Canada.</v>

1516
01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:37.363
<v Speaker 3>It's not Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Continental us and I read a similar </v>

1517
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:44.000
<v Speaker 3>study in natural history magazine a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago about Great Britain.</v>

1518
01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.530
<v Speaker 3>Same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same kind of thing.</v>

1519
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:46.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1520
01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:48.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the figures anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1521
01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:50.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean cats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1522
01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:51.073
<v Speaker 3>they devastate bird populations and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>letting your cat Rome out through the </v>

1523
01:27:56.691 --> 01:27:57.524
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it seems like this very </v>

1524
01:27:58.911 --> 01:28:01.670
<v Speaker 3>compassionate thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1525
01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:07.340
<v Speaker 3>fluffy wants to be out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fluffy needs some space to roam,</v>

1526
01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:12.760
<v Speaker 3>but you're releasing an extremely </v>
<v Speaker 3>effective Predator into the world.</v>

1527
01:28:13.370 --> 01:28:18.370
<v Speaker 3>And that's the results of it and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes have shown up in town,</v>

1528
01:28:20.180 --> 01:28:24.100
<v Speaker 3>it's suddenly getting a lot harder to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make a living as a bird killing cats.</v>

1529
01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:25.233
<v Speaker 3>And so we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting a sharp uptick now in </v>

1530
01:28:29.020 --> 01:28:31.070
<v Speaker 3>songbirds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1531
01:28:31.071 --> 01:28:34.280
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting how it all just cycles </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll just make sense and I'll figure</v>

1532
01:28:34.281 --> 01:28:36.170
<v Speaker 3>it out at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seeks its own level.</v>

1533
01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:37.343
<v Speaker 3>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that I've found </v>

1534
01:28:37.791 --> 01:28:38.624
<v Speaker 3>hilarious was we were talking on is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast about a group that approached </v>

1535
01:28:41.151 --> 01:28:44.390
<v Speaker 3>you and they were doing a documentary on</v>
<v Speaker 3>saving the coyote.</v>

1536
01:28:45.260 --> 01:28:48.290
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was a,</v>

1537
01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:50.540
<v Speaker 3>a couple of women,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1538
01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:51.290
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1539
01:28:51.290 --> 01:28:55.160
<v Speaker 3>were pretty fresh in into the southwest </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Santa Fe.</v>

1540
01:28:55.161 --> 01:28:55.994
<v Speaker 3>They hadn't been in town for very long </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they were interested in doing a </v>

1541
01:29:00.630 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 3>documentary to save</v>

1542
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:05.460
<v Speaker 4>the Coyote and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1543
01:29:05.461 --> 01:29:09.300
<v Speaker 4>so I mean there's a way to approach </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing something like that.</v>

1544
01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:10.530
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you could say,</v>

1545
01:29:10.531 --> 01:29:11.364
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I want wildlife services to stop </v>

1546
01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:18.030
<v Speaker 4>killing 80,000 of them a year on behalf </v>
<v Speaker 4>of agriculture.</v>

1547
01:29:18.930 --> 01:29:19.763
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what these women didn't seem to </v>

1548
01:29:22.530 --> 01:29:23.363
<v Speaker 4>quite have a handle on was that coyotes </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't need our help in saving </v>

1549
01:29:30.721 --> 01:29:34.170
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're perfectly capable of doing it.</v>

1550
01:29:34.710 --> 01:29:35.760
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1551
01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:38.550
<v Speaker 4>this is not an animal you have to worry </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

1552
01:29:38.551 --> 01:29:42.000
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going on the endangered species list.</v>

1553
01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:43.493
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's not gonna happen as one of </v>

1554
01:29:47.701 --> 01:29:49.680
<v Speaker 4>the people who blurbed my book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

1555
01:29:49.681 --> 01:29:51.620
<v Speaker 4>it was bill mckibben,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nature writer.</v>

1556
01:29:51.630 --> 01:29:53.910
<v Speaker 4>Now that I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things he said was that,</v>

1557
01:29:54.410 --> 01:29:55.243
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in his blurb was that a biologist wants </v>

1558
01:29:57.601 --> 01:30:02.601
<v Speaker 4>told him that when the last human dies </v>
<v Speaker 4>on earth,</v>

1559
01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:09.140
<v Speaker 4>a coyote will be sitting on that humans </v>
<v Speaker 4>grave howling at the moon.</v>

1560
01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:14.610
<v Speaker 4>I've always loved that thought because </v>
<v Speaker 4>of course it's a,</v>

1561
01:30:15.330 --> 01:30:18.410
<v Speaker 4>it's an indication of how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what great survivors they are.</v>

1562
01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:19.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1563
01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:22.240
<v Speaker 2>you are starting to see a resurgence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves in Europe.</v>

1564
01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:23.103
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1565
01:30:23.170 --> 01:30:28.170
<v Speaker 2>there was actually an article recently </v>
<v Speaker 2>published in Paris about it were,</v>

1566
01:30:28.201 --> 01:30:29.034
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess the mayor of Paris was telling </v>

1567
01:30:30.131 --> 01:30:30.964
<v Speaker 2>people not to be alarmed because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>only look for four legged pray and </v>

1568
01:30:34.331 --> 01:30:35.890
<v Speaker 2>people shouldn't be worried about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves.</v>

1569
01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:40.120
<v Speaker 2>But the idea of these animals like </v>
<v Speaker 2>intermingling with our,</v>

1570
01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:42.210
<v Speaker 2>with our civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1571
01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:43.270
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have decided,</v>

1572
01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:46.090
<v Speaker 2>we put some hardscape down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put up some houses,</v>

1573
01:30:46.091 --> 01:30:47.440
<v Speaker 2>and we'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is our stuff.</v>

1574
01:30:47.830 --> 01:30:48.663
<v Speaker 2>You got to stay out and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize these boundaries and now </v>

1575
01:30:51.611 --> 01:30:54.430
<v Speaker 2>you're slowly starting to see these </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals creep back in,</v>

1576
01:30:54.460 --> 01:30:55.900
<v Speaker 2>in Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>France,</v>

1577
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.930
<v Speaker 2>in Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1578
01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1579
01:30:59.140 --> 01:30:59.741
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1580
01:30:59.741 --> 01:31:02.560
<v Speaker 2>I think when we moved into cities 5,000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

1581
01:31:02.561 --> 01:31:04.930
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we thought we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting away from,</v>

1582
01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.480
<v Speaker 2>by living in cities was predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1583
01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:09.380
<v Speaker 2>And the most part we have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1584
01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:09.770
<v Speaker 2>Most</v>

1585
01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:10.420
<v Speaker 4>part we have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1586
01:31:10.420 --> 01:31:11.360
<v Speaker 4>we don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1587
01:31:11.361 --> 01:31:12.194
<v Speaker 4>at least not so far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have lepers in patrolling the </v>

1588
01:31:14.691 --> 01:31:16.420
<v Speaker 4>alleys and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1589
01:31:16.421 --> 01:31:17.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Denver.</v>

1590
01:31:17.601 --> 01:31:20.240
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1591
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:23.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm intrigued by one of the stories I </v>
<v Speaker 4>uncovered in the book,</v>

1592
01:31:23.991 --> 01:31:24.824
<v Speaker 4>which is an argument that I make is </v>
<v Speaker 4>based on the work of a graduate student </v>

1593
01:31:29.421 --> 01:31:33.540
<v Speaker 4>I knew at the University of Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his name is John Hall and he was doing a</v>

1594
01:31:34.110 --> 01:31:39.080
<v Speaker 4>dissertation in history on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what he was calling the great dog war in</v>

1595
01:31:39.081 --> 01:31:41.180
<v Speaker 4>the 19th century and what it was all </v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

1596
01:31:41.181 --> 01:31:42.014
<v Speaker 4>And the more I dug into it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I realized this is one of the </v>

1597
01:31:43.521 --> 01:31:48.500
<v Speaker 4>explanations for why you don't see </v>
<v Speaker 4>accounts of coyotes in cities much.</v>

1598
01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:50.540
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even in,</v>

1599
01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:51.403
<v Speaker 4>in La.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the first accounts I've seen of </v>

1600
01:31:53.651 --> 01:31:56.390
<v Speaker 4>Katie's in La for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during the 19 twenties,</v>

1601
01:31:57.260 --> 01:32:02.260
<v Speaker 4>but it's because in the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 4>until about the 18 seventies,</v>

1602
01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:04.473
<v Speaker 4>we let dogs our own pets and packs of </v>
<v Speaker 4>feral dogs roam through American cities </v>

1603
01:32:14.110 --> 01:32:14.943
<v Speaker 4>at will.</v>

1604
01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:20.250
<v Speaker 4>And so every city in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a large population of feral and sort</v>

1605
01:32:21.371 --> 01:32:25.960
<v Speaker 4>of loosely owned dogs roaming around our</v>
<v Speaker 4>city scapes.</v>

1606
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:27.980
<v Speaker 4>Pharaoh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning they were totally wild,</v>

1607
01:32:27.981 --> 01:32:30.340
<v Speaker 4>or people would feed them and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>would feed them.</v>

1608
01:32:30.370 --> 01:32:34.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were just basically stray dogs that</v>

1609
01:32:34.061 --> 01:32:34.894
<v Speaker 4>would roam the city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would find things to scavenge </v>

1610
01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:37.984
<v Speaker 4>behind restaurants and behind the houses</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they would knock over people's </v>

1611
01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:45.560
<v Speaker 4>garbage and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But in the.</v>

1612
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:48.610
<v Speaker 4>This happened in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in the late 18,</v>

1613
01:32:48.611 --> 01:32:49.444
<v Speaker 4>40 [inaudible] Boston had an epidemic </v>
<v Speaker 4>one year of rabies attacks from these </v>

1614
01:32:56.351 --> 01:32:57.184
<v Speaker 4>kinds of wild dogs in the city and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>Boston began to institute what became </v>

1615
01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:08.580
<v Speaker 4>our modern system of dog catchers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dog pound's leash laws,</v>

1616
01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:11.073
<v Speaker 4>doc control,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was at the Moma when the Boston </v>

1617
01:33:16.031 --> 01:33:20.290
<v Speaker 4>model began to spread to Philadelphia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to New York,</v>

1618
01:33:20.291 --> 01:33:23.710
<v Speaker 4>eventually to New Orleans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eventually to the cities in California,</v>

1619
01:33:24.130 --> 01:33:27.220
<v Speaker 4>and we sort of instituted this new model</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1620
01:33:27.221 --> 01:33:28.054
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a dog is properly meant to be in an </v>

1621
01:33:31.511 --> 01:33:32.344
<v Speaker 4>enclosed yard on a leash when it's with </v>
<v Speaker 4>its owner is supposed to be running </v>

1622
01:33:36.731 --> 01:33:41.500
<v Speaker 4>through the streets with packs of other </v>
<v Speaker 4>dogs scavenging a garbage and stuff.</v>

1623
01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:42.993
<v Speaker 4>When we did that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what that in effect did was to open up </v>

1624
01:33:48.220 --> 01:33:53.220
<v Speaker 4>the niche in American cities for wild </v>
<v Speaker 4>canids and the wild Canaan that was able</v>

1625
01:33:54.311 --> 01:33:55.144
<v Speaker 4>to take advantage of it was the coyote </v>
<v Speaker 4>that provided them the opening that </v>

1626
01:33:59.501 --> 01:34:00.334
<v Speaker 4>hadn't been there before because a </v>
<v Speaker 4>coyote wandering into a city and the 18 </v>

1627
01:34:05.141 --> 01:34:08.470
<v Speaker 4>sixties or 18 thirties would end up </v>
<v Speaker 4>being,</v>

1628
01:34:08.530 --> 01:34:09.363
<v Speaker 4>of course assaulted by dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Suddenly all the dogs were put up and </v>

1629
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:18.750
<v Speaker 4>that opened up the cities to the arrival</v>
<v Speaker 4>of coyotes in our midst.</v>

1630
01:34:19.930 --> 01:34:20.763
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1631
01:34:22.670 --> 01:34:23.503
<v Speaker 4>Just the interface between human beings </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the wild and our interaction with </v>

1632
01:34:28.181 --> 01:34:33.010
<v Speaker 4>the wild and then to start our ability </v>
<v Speaker 4>or inability to manipulate it.</v>

1633
01:34:33.011 --> 01:34:33.844
<v Speaker 4>It's just so fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that I wanted to </v>

1634
01:34:35.921 --> 01:34:38.110
<v Speaker 4>talk to you about is what they're trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do right now,</v>

1635
01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:39.093
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in I guess it's Wyoming and parts of </v>

1636
01:34:41.321 --> 01:34:42.460
<v Speaker 4>Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1637
01:34:42.461 --> 01:34:44.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>American Serengeti Project.</v>

1638
01:34:45.090 --> 01:34:48.340
<v Speaker 4>Now we please explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1639
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:50.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this,</v>

1640
01:34:50.630 --> 01:34:54.880
<v Speaker 4>this other book that we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've talked about some of mine that has</v>

1641
01:34:54.940 --> 01:34:57.040
<v Speaker 4>been out now just about a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It came out,</v>

1642
01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>last,</v>

1643
01:34:58.300 --> 01:35:01.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>last March of 2016.</v>

1644
01:35:02.050 --> 01:35:04.400
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a book,</v>

1645
01:35:04.401 --> 01:35:05.234
<v Speaker 4>American Serengeti is a book that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the story of the Great Plains and </v>

1646
01:35:10.041 --> 01:35:15.041
<v Speaker 4>the fact that we had up until about a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred and 25 or 130 years ago in North</v>

1647
01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:19.633
<v Speaker 4>America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the what was widely regarded </v>

1648
01:35:21.141 --> 01:35:24.860
<v Speaker 4>around the globe as one of the great </v>
<v Speaker 4>wildlife spectacles of,</v>

1649
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:25.790
<v Speaker 4>of the world.</v>

1650
01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:27.253
<v Speaker 4>And these enormous herds of bison have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>reemerging wildhorse bands of </v>

1651
01:35:35.780 --> 01:35:38.330
<v Speaker 4>pronghorns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe 15,</v>

1652
01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.850
<v Speaker 4>$18 million pronghorns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1653
01:35:40.860 --> 01:35:41.693
<v Speaker 4>not quite as many as bison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but almost as many a half million gray </v>

1654
01:35:45.591 --> 01:35:47.510
<v Speaker 4>wolves that were their predators.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

1655
01:35:47.511 --> 01:35:52.511
<v Speaker 4>coyotes playing the role of Jackals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a grizzly bears that roamed,</v>

1656
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.863
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the original range of the grizzly bear </v>

1657
01:35:54.921 --> 01:35:55.754
<v Speaker 4>was actually out on the plains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were all the way out into Kansas </v>

1658
01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:00.973
<v Speaker 4>and into Nebraska.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean everybody saw the movie </v>

1659
01:36:04.611 --> 01:36:06.530
<v Speaker 4>revenant of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1660
01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:09.170
<v Speaker 4>which the filmmaker said in the rocky </v>
<v Speaker 4>mountains.</v>

1661
01:36:09.171 --> 01:36:12.020
<v Speaker 4>But that was based on an actual event </v>
<v Speaker 4>that happened in history.</v>

1662
01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:13.373
<v Speaker 4>A guy named Hugh glass getting mauled by</v>
<v Speaker 4>a grizzly that happened in South Dakota </v>

1663
01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:17.893
<v Speaker 4>though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not up in the mountains because the </v>

1664
01:36:20.361 --> 01:36:21.194
<v Speaker 4>grizzlies were out on the plains in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>version of the Serengeti that prevailed </v>

1665
01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:26.953
<v Speaker 4>a 150 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we ended up basically a wiping all </v>

1666
01:36:34.030 --> 01:36:35.030
<v Speaker 4>those animals out.</v>

1667
01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:35.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1668
01:36:35.690 --> 01:36:40.690
<v Speaker 4>we wiped out probably as many as 30 </v>
<v Speaker 4>million bison through the 19th century.</v>

1669
01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:41.593
<v Speaker 4>Almost all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got the prom horns down from 15 </v>

1670
01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:46.640
<v Speaker 4>million to about 13,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1671
01:36:46.670 --> 01:36:47.503
<v Speaker 4>we drove the elk off the great plains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was their primary range was the </v>

1672
01:36:51.261 --> 01:36:52.094
<v Speaker 4>planes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We drove them off and up into the </v>

1673
01:36:53.001 --> 01:36:55.430
<v Speaker 4>mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did the same thing with the grizzlies.</v>

1674
01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:59.900
<v Speaker 4>So we basically reduced this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this American Serengeti,</v>

1675
01:36:59.930 --> 01:37:00.763
<v Speaker 4>which Africa didn't do with its </v>
<v Speaker 4>Serengeti or it's [inaudible] or it's </v>

1676
01:37:04.311 --> 01:37:06.380
<v Speaker 4>veiled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It preserved all.</v>

1677
01:37:06.381 --> 01:37:07.214
<v Speaker 4>It's great animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we destroyed hours and ended up not </v>

1678
01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:14.713
<v Speaker 4>ever successfully creating any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wildlife preserve to sort of save at </v>

1679
01:37:19.641 --> 01:37:21.350
<v Speaker 4>least a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1680
01:37:21.890 --> 01:37:25.250
<v Speaker 4>we got yellowstone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but of course yellowstone is said in the</v>

1681
01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:26.113
<v Speaker 4>rocky mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what this American prairie </v>

1682
01:37:29.601 --> 01:37:33.020
<v Speaker 4>reserve is about now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's based in Bozeman,</v>

1683
01:37:33.021 --> 01:37:35.990
<v Speaker 4>Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's only about a dozen years old,</v>

1684
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:41.360
<v Speaker 4>but it's been pretty wildly successful </v>
<v Speaker 4>in trying to do this.</v>

1685
01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:43.153
<v Speaker 4>It's had the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This group of people has had the </v>

1686
01:37:46.641 --> 01:37:51.641
<v Speaker 4>imagination to try to recreate this </v>
<v Speaker 4>American Serengeti that we are.</v>

1687
01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 4>Our government in our state craft never </v>
<v Speaker 4>did preserve</v>

1688
01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:01.000
<v Speaker 3>forests and so what they've got in mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>in central Montana is taking a couple of</v>

1689
01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:06.510
<v Speaker 3>large pieces of of existing public </v>
<v Speaker 3>lands.</v>

1690
01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:07.733
<v Speaker 3>One is the Missouri River Breaks </v>
<v Speaker 3>National Monument that Bill Clinton </v>

1691
01:38:11.401 --> 01:38:12.234
<v Speaker 3>created a all along the Missouri River </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then just downstream of it still </v>

1692
01:38:16.531 --> 01:38:21.360
<v Speaker 3>along the Missouri River is the Charles </v>
<v Speaker 3>m russell national wildlife refuge.</v>

1693
01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:22.913
<v Speaker 3>And together those two public lands that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are along the Missouri River and mostly </v>

1694
01:38:27.930 --> 01:38:31.440
<v Speaker 3>on the South Bank of the Missouri River </v>
<v Speaker 3>in central Montana,</v>

1695
01:38:32.650 --> 01:38:37.350
<v Speaker 3>make up about one point six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one point 7 million acres.</v>

1696
01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:42.210
<v Speaker 3>And what American prairie reserve is </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do is to,</v>

1697
01:38:42.270 --> 01:38:43.103
<v Speaker 3>as they come up for sale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to acquire the private ranches on the </v>

1698
01:38:47.941 --> 01:38:52.941
<v Speaker 3>north side of the river,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the idea of ultimately creating a,</v>

1699
01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:55.333
<v Speaker 3>a preserved that's going to be maybe as </v>
<v Speaker 3>big as twice the size of yellowstone </v>

1700
01:38:59.581 --> 01:39:00.414
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little more than 2 million acres and </v>

1701
01:39:01.831 --> 01:39:02.664
<v Speaker 3>American prairie reserve is shooting for</v>
<v Speaker 3>a preserve that would be something like </v>

1702
01:39:05.731 --> 01:39:10.731
<v Speaker 3>4 million acres with the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 3>recreating this American Serengeti,</v>

1703
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.860
<v Speaker 3>of repopulating it with Bison pronghorns</v>
<v Speaker 3>with elk,</v>

1704
01:39:16.861 --> 01:39:19.050
<v Speaker 3>with big horn sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with mule deer.</v>

1705
01:39:19.050 --> 01:39:19.883
<v Speaker 3>All the animals that were there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then because they're a private </v>

1706
01:39:22.801 --> 01:39:25.500
<v Speaker 3>entity and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the fish and wildlife service,</v>

1707
01:39:25.501 --> 01:39:30.501
<v Speaker 3>so they can't on their own merits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>reintroduce wolves or grizzly bears.</v>

1708
01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:31.973
<v Speaker 3>Just sort of sitting back and hoping and</v>
<v Speaker 3>letting wolves come out of the nearby </v>

1709
01:39:38.701 --> 01:39:43.470
<v Speaker 3>rockies and grizzlies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which every spring now are coming out of</v>

1710
01:39:43.471 --> 01:39:44.490
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1711
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:45.383
<v Speaker 3>the rocky mountain front and Montana and</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting out sometimes as much as 100 </v>

1712
01:39:48.511 --> 01:39:49.344
<v Speaker 3>miles out into the plains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the American prairie reserve wants </v>

1713
01:39:52.051 --> 01:39:56.820
<v Speaker 3>to happen is for these animals to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the way out to this preserve,</v>

1714
01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:57.713
<v Speaker 3>find this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>recreated American Serengeti with all </v>

1715
01:40:01.081 --> 01:40:01.914
<v Speaker 3>the animals that were there and give us </v>
<v Speaker 3>in our own time and the 21st century </v>

1716
01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:12.080
<v Speaker 3>this chance to not just read about this </v>
<v Speaker 3>in history are maybe see some version of</v>

1717
01:40:14.281 --> 01:40:15.114
<v Speaker 3>it on a late night old western movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but actually to experience it ourselves </v>

1718
01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:20.273
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how are they going to reintroduce these </v>

1719
01:40:20.761 --> 01:40:22.020
<v Speaker 3>animals and where they going to get them</v>
<v Speaker 3>from?</v>

1720
01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:23.190
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1721
01:40:23.190 --> 01:40:27.270
<v Speaker 3>getting the Bison is not too difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>because their surplus bison,</v>

1722
01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty much around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1723
01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:30.113
<v Speaker 3>most of the West.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we've got a larger bison </v>

1724
01:40:32.221 --> 01:40:36.390
<v Speaker 3>population in North America right now </v>
<v Speaker 3>than we've had since the 18 nineties.</v>

1725
01:40:37.230 --> 01:40:38.063
<v Speaker 3>More than 300,000 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's fairly easy to come up with </v>

1726
01:40:40.951 --> 01:40:44.640
<v Speaker 3>bison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pronghorns are already there.</v>

1727
01:40:45.090 --> 01:40:45.923
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so all you have to do is just sort </v>

1728
01:40:47.191 --> 01:40:51.390
<v Speaker 3>of make conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1729
01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:53.710
<v Speaker 3>beneficial for their herds to grow.</v>

1730
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:56.740
<v Speaker 4>Same thing with mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with elk,</v>

1731
01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:57.753
<v Speaker 4>with big horns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going that they'll have to </v>

1732
01:40:58.871 --> 01:41:01.360
<v Speaker 4>reintroduce big horns.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that was an original range.</v>

1733
01:41:01.361 --> 01:41:04.780
<v Speaker 4>There were big horns out on the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the badlands of the great plains.</v>

1734
01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:06.640
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I said,</v>

1735
01:41:06.641 --> 01:41:07.474
<v Speaker 4>they can't deliberately on their own </v>
<v Speaker 4>reintroduce gray wolves or grizzly </v>

1736
01:41:12.281 --> 01:41:16.870
<v Speaker 4>bears,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're a idea is that if wolves and</v>

1737
01:41:16.871 --> 01:41:19.210
<v Speaker 4>grizzlies get there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they're welcome.</v>

1738
01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:23.410
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the idea is they probably wants this</v>

1739
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:24.663
<v Speaker 4>preserve exists with all these grazing </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals that the wolves and the bears </v>

1740
01:41:28.841 --> 01:41:29.890
<v Speaker 4>will,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will find it.</v>

1741
01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:31.720
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so fascinating.</v>

1742
01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:34.900
<v Speaker 4>And now do they have a timeline?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to accomplish this in,</v>

1743
01:41:34.990 --> 01:41:36.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

1744
01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:37.323
<v Speaker 4>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've been around for about 10 or 12 </v>

1745
01:41:39.071 --> 01:41:39.904
<v Speaker 4>years now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they've raised more than $130 </v>

1746
01:41:42.681 --> 01:41:43.514
<v Speaker 4>million dollars and they've got major </v>
<v Speaker 4>donors on both the coasts along with </v>

1747
01:41:48.071 --> 01:41:49.120
<v Speaker 4>lots of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1748
01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:53.650
<v Speaker 4>just people like you and me who give </v>
<v Speaker 4>them 10 and $15 or $25.</v>

1749
01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:57.820
<v Speaker 4>I've got lots of friends who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once I sort of alerted them to this,</v>

1750
01:41:57.821 --> 01:42:00.600
<v Speaker 4>who have joined American prairie reserve</v>
<v Speaker 4>and our,</v>

1751
01:42:00.650 --> 01:42:02.440
<v Speaker 4>and our donors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>small donors.</v>

1752
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:03.833
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the timeline is basically whenever they </v>

1753
01:42:07.541 --> 01:42:09.370
<v Speaker 4>can make it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1754
01:42:09.500 --> 01:42:11.020
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some,</v>

1755
01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:14.860
<v Speaker 4>a considerable resistance from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ranching community,</v>

1756
01:42:15.460 --> 01:42:16.293
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only in Montana but kind of across </v>

1757
01:42:18.461 --> 01:42:19.294
<v Speaker 4>the West because ranchers don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 4>see Bison and especially by sudden </v>

1758
01:42:24.341 --> 01:42:25.174
<v Speaker 4>predators replace cattle herds,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's kind of an ideological </v>

1759
01:42:30.041 --> 01:42:32.530
<v Speaker 4>opposition on the part of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of ranching people,</v>

1760
01:42:32.590 --> 01:42:33.880
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's two fold,</v>

1761
01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:34.714
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one because of the food that the </v>

1762
01:42:37.001 --> 01:42:39.670
<v Speaker 4>bison would eat because the battle for </v>
<v Speaker 4>resources,</v>

1763
01:42:39.671 --> 01:42:42.190
<v Speaker 4>but also because of brucellosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1764
01:42:42.250 --> 01:42:45.880
<v Speaker 4>brucellosis of courses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in Montana and they explained</v>

1765
01:42:45.881 --> 01:42:49.390
<v Speaker 4>to people that's disease disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a disease that,</v>

1766
01:42:49.391 --> 01:42:50.224
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that bison and elk have and that if </v>

1767
01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:59.440
<v Speaker 4>cattle get it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their beef cannot be sold,</v>

1768
01:42:59.850 --> 01:43:01.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in North American markets,</v>

1769
01:43:01.930 --> 01:43:06.070
<v Speaker 4>all beef that's sold in our supermarkets</v>
<v Speaker 4>has to be brucellosis free.</v>

1770
01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:07.553
<v Speaker 4>And how do they determine that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they have to test each individual </v>

1771
01:43:09.281 --> 01:43:10.540
<v Speaker 4>animal when they swatted them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1772
01:43:10.541 --> 01:43:12.220
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they would,</v>

1773
01:43:12.221 --> 01:43:13.054
<v Speaker 4>if there was a real threat about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The truth is there has never been an </v>

1774
01:43:16.001 --> 01:43:16.834
<v Speaker 4>instance in the wild of either a bison </v>
<v Speaker 4>or an elk transferring brucellosis to </v>

1775
01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:23.500
<v Speaker 4>cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How would they transfer it to the FDA at</v>

1776
01:43:23.501 --> 01:43:26.020
<v Speaker 4>the same food?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they basically,</v>

1777
01:43:26.021 --> 01:43:29.920
<v Speaker 4>it comes through a largely from </v>
<v Speaker 4>afterbirth whenever they,</v>

1778
01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:33.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever a bison a cow for example,</v>

1779
01:43:33.131 --> 01:43:33.964
<v Speaker 4>that has brucellosis gives birth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If cattle come through the area a say </v>

1780
01:43:39.611 --> 01:43:44.611
<v Speaker 4>within a few days and graze the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>grass where after birth,</v>

1781
01:43:45.190 --> 01:43:46.023
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has been dropped from a brucellosis </v>

1782
01:43:47.411 --> 01:43:48.244
<v Speaker 4>infected bison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the theory is that a cow could get </v>

1783
01:43:53.061 --> 01:43:56.270
<v Speaker 4>the disease.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been made to happen that way.</v>

1784
01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:57.193
<v Speaker 4>And laboratories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have no record of it ever having </v>

1785
01:44:00.321 --> 01:44:02.030
<v Speaker 4>happened in the wild.</v>

1786
01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:04.520
<v Speaker 4>When now when they made it happen in </v>
<v Speaker 4>laboratories,</v>

1787
01:44:04.521 --> 01:44:08.570
<v Speaker 4>did they force feed the cows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

1788
01:44:08.571 --> 01:44:10.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have to say that I've,</v>

1789
01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:13.340
<v Speaker 4>I've not read the study so I'm not quite</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure how they,</v>

1790
01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:16.010
<v Speaker 4>how they pulled it off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they did.</v>

1791
01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:19.730
<v Speaker 4>They did make the transfer happen in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>laboratory setting.</v>

1792
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:21.223
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's been bizarre about the whole </v>

1793
01:44:22.431 --> 01:44:23.264
<v Speaker 4>brucellosis thing is that elk are </v>
<v Speaker 4>infected with brucellosis far more than </v>

1794
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:27.703
<v Speaker 4>by center,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the ranching community doesn't seem </v>

1795
01:44:29.901 --> 01:44:33.530
<v Speaker 4>to be concerned about elk bison that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't want.</v>

1796
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:34.910
<v Speaker 4>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1797
01:44:34.911 --> 01:44:35.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>part of it,</v>

1798
01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:40.840
<v Speaker 4>it seems to me almost dates back to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>19th century when we destroyed the,</v>

1799
01:44:41.061 --> 01:44:41.894
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>original American Serengeti and killed </v>

1800
01:44:43.611 --> 01:44:44.444
<v Speaker 4>all these bison and converted the great </v>
<v Speaker 4>plains into largely a ranching country </v>

1801
01:44:49.190 --> 01:44:50.023
<v Speaker 4>with cattle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean in the idea has been from the </v>

1802
01:44:52.551 --> 01:44:53.384
<v Speaker 4>ranching community ever since that bison</v>
<v Speaker 4>are a direct threat to the existing </v>

1803
01:44:58.701 --> 01:45:03.701
<v Speaker 4>ranching community that if you get too </v>
<v Speaker 4>many people and namor herd of Bison,</v>

1804
01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:06.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1805
01:45:06.921 --> 01:45:10.160
<v Speaker 4>and I'm not sure I can track the logic </v>
<v Speaker 4>of their arguments,</v>

1806
01:45:10.161 --> 01:45:13.490
<v Speaker 4>but it somehow seems to lead in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>direction.</v>

1807
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:19.000
<v Speaker 4>They don't like people introducing bison</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the middle of a ranching setting,</v>

1808
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:23.263
<v Speaker 4>particularly what they don't seem to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like is someone with an old Montana </v>

1809
01:45:27.951 --> 01:45:32.951
<v Speaker 4>ranch of 40 or 50,000 acres selling that</v>
<v Speaker 4>ranch.</v>

1810
01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:36.500
<v Speaker 4>So somebody like American prairie </v>
<v Speaker 4>reserve,</v>

1811
01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:37.873
<v Speaker 4>which clearly is going to introduce </v>
<v Speaker 4>wildlife on it and remove it from as an </v>

1812
01:45:44.030 --> 01:45:44.863
<v Speaker 4>active sort of livestock ranching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A economic enterprise is interesting </v>

1813
01:45:49.491 --> 01:45:53.420
<v Speaker 4>because it's a superior meet to bisons </v>
<v Speaker 4>better meat and that's a better meat,</v>

1814
01:45:53.421 --> 01:45:55.700
<v Speaker 4>better meat for you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>much less fat in it.</v>

1815
01:45:56.610 --> 01:45:57.410
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1816
01:45:57.410 --> 01:46:01.130
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is a,</v>

1817
01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:02.473
<v Speaker 4>I think the most exciting conservation </v>
<v Speaker 4>project that's out in the West in our </v>

1818
01:46:09.171 --> 01:46:10.240
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1819
01:46:10.970 --> 01:46:15.080
<v Speaker 4>this is something that we didn't get and</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people don't know that.</v>

1820
01:46:15.081 --> 01:46:15.914
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of why I wrote this American</v>
<v Speaker 4>Serengeti Book because I wanted people </v>

1821
01:46:18.411 --> 01:46:19.244
<v Speaker 4>to understand that only 120 530 years </v>
<v Speaker 4>ago we had the equivalent of the Masai </v>

1822
01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:30.220
<v Speaker 4>Mara in places like Nebraska and South </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dakota and eastern Montana and wow.</v>

1823
01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:35.270
<v Speaker 4>And we destroyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just like that and just the space of</v>

1824
01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:37.580
<v Speaker 4>a few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we completely wiped it out.</v>

1825
01:46:37.581 --> 01:46:38.414
<v Speaker 4>And as I said a minute ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what seems to me to be the largest </v>

1826
01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:46.490
<v Speaker 4>destruction wholesale destruction of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wildlife discoverable in modern history.</v>

1827
01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:50.490
<v Speaker 4>And so right now the American prairie </v>
<v Speaker 4>reserve is just,</v>

1828
01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:51.353
<v Speaker 4>they're just taking that land and buying</v>
<v Speaker 4>it up and they haven't started this </v>

1829
01:46:55.501 --> 01:46:57.510
<v Speaker 4>project at now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have started the project.</v>

1830
01:46:57.511 --> 01:46:58.344
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it certainly exists and I've got a map </v>

1831
01:46:59.971 --> 01:47:00.804
<v Speaker 4>of it in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the book and American Serengeti and </v>

1832
01:47:03.331 --> 01:47:06.020
<v Speaker 4>they've reintroduced animals already.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have reintroduced animals.</v>

1833
01:47:06.030 --> 01:47:10.470
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to come up with 12,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they have an instagram page.</v>

1834
01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:11.190
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1835
01:47:11.190 --> 01:47:13.050
<v Speaker 4>American prairie reserve as an instagram</v>
<v Speaker 4>page.</v>

1836
01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:15.120
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only 1700 followers.</v>

1837
01:47:15.210 --> 01:47:16.043
<v Speaker 4>How dare they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So click on that picture of the bison </v>

1838
01:47:18.301 --> 01:47:19.350
<v Speaker 4>down there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Below that,</v>

1839
01:47:19.770 --> 01:47:21.450
<v Speaker 4>below that Jamie lower right hand </v>
<v Speaker 4>corner.</v>

1840
01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:23.730
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lower right hand corner.</v>

1841
01:47:23.820 --> 01:47:24.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1842
01:47:25.750 --> 01:47:27.120
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

1843
01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:28.920
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1844
01:47:28.921 --> 01:47:29.754
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of bias in there roaming </v>

1845
01:47:31.171 --> 01:47:33.170
<v Speaker 4>around and this is land that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>occupied.</v>

1846
01:47:33.171 --> 01:47:34.004
<v Speaker 4>And so these bison have a essentially </v>
<v Speaker 4>very few predators and they're just </v>

1847
01:47:38.281 --> 01:47:40.200
<v Speaker 4>wandering around and they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>repopulate.</v>

1848
01:47:40.490 --> 01:47:42.080
<v Speaker 4>We've got to repopulate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1849
01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:44.580
<v Speaker 4>so one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1850
01:47:44.581 --> 01:47:45.414
<v Speaker 4>American prairie reserve does when they </v>
<v Speaker 4>acquire these ranches is that they </v>

1851
01:47:49.111 --> 01:47:49.944
<v Speaker 4>remove the fencing from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they've been fenced of course to </v>

1852
01:47:52.831 --> 01:47:56.250
<v Speaker 4>create pastures for bison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they removed or for cattle,</v>

1853
01:47:56.251 --> 01:47:59.670
<v Speaker 4>but they removed the fencing in order to</v>
<v Speaker 4>let bison roam freely.</v>

1854
01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:00.773
<v Speaker 4>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea is you ultimately have to have </v>

1855
01:48:03.511 --> 01:48:04.344
<v Speaker 4>the predators back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to have a complete </v>

1856
01:48:06.091 --> 01:48:09.360
<v Speaker 4>ecosystem unless you have the predators </v>
<v Speaker 4>there as well.</v>

1857
01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:10.530
<v Speaker 4>That is really tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1858
01:48:11.250 --> 01:48:14.100
<v Speaker 4>Because they're not allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>reintroduce grizzly bears.</v>

1859
01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:16.950
<v Speaker 4>They are not allowed to as a private </v>
<v Speaker 4>organization,</v>

1860
01:48:17.010 --> 01:48:18.870
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fish and wildlife service would have</v>

1861
01:48:18.871 --> 01:48:21.210
<v Speaker 4>to do this and fish and wildlife service</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't actually,</v>

1862
01:48:21.211 --> 01:48:22.044
<v Speaker 4>even the public lands that are there are</v>
<v Speaker 4>not managed by the US fish and wildlife </v>

1863
01:48:26.671 --> 01:48:27.504
<v Speaker 4>service.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And good luck getting cooperation from </v>

1864
01:48:29.131 --> 01:48:29.964
<v Speaker 4>people in Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's still stinging from the wolves </v>

1865
01:48:31.591 --> 01:48:36.450
<v Speaker 4>being introduced into yellowstone and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the decimation of the elk population and</v>

1866
01:48:36.451 --> 01:48:38.480
<v Speaker 4>all the other livestock issues that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've had there.</v>

1867
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:39.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1868
01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:40.073
<v Speaker 4>so they argue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least when I was at the last few </v>

1869
01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:43.853
<v Speaker 4>years I was in Montana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this was about 10 years after the </v>

1870
01:48:46.321 --> 01:48:50.340
<v Speaker 4>wolves had been recovered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had about 1700 gray wolves in Montana</v>

1871
01:48:50.430 --> 01:48:52.860
<v Speaker 4>or in the northern rockies actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1872
01:48:52.861 --> 01:48:55.830
<v Speaker 4>by about 2012 or so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1873
01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:58.193
<v Speaker 4>so the hunters in Montana were up in </v>
<v Speaker 4>arms sort of the way these white tail </v>

1874
01:49:05.701 --> 01:49:09.450
<v Speaker 4>hunters in South Carolina now are up in </v>
<v Speaker 4>arms over coyotes.</v>

1875
01:49:09.890 --> 01:49:10.723
<v Speaker 4>The hunters of Montana were up in arms </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it wasn't so easy to get an elk </v>

1876
01:49:14.431 --> 01:49:16.140
<v Speaker 4>anymore and they blamed it all on </v>
<v Speaker 4>wolves.</v>

1877
01:49:16.141 --> 01:49:19.680
<v Speaker 4>And someone from the University of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Montana did a study of a particular herd</v>

1878
01:49:19.681 --> 01:49:20.514
<v Speaker 4>that had been singled out as one that </v>
<v Speaker 4>was just being harassed by wolves and </v>

1879
01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:25.950
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was impossible to kill bull there</v>

1880
01:49:25.951 --> 01:49:26.784
<v Speaker 4>anymore and concluded that actually most</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the production that was taking place </v>

1881
01:49:30.481 --> 01:49:31.314
<v Speaker 4>on that elk herd was from mountain lions</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not the wolves that had been </v>

1882
01:49:34.591 --> 01:49:35.424
<v Speaker 4>reintroduced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's become the for the hunting </v>

1883
01:49:38.101 --> 01:49:40.260
<v Speaker 4>community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sport hunting community,</v>

1884
01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:41.453
<v Speaker 4>which has had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course a century now of getting to </v>

1885
01:49:44.221 --> 01:49:48.250
<v Speaker 4>hunt elk and white tails and deer and </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything else</v>

1886
01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:49.473
<v Speaker 2>without competition from predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has become kind of the new excuse </v>

1887
01:49:54.640 --> 01:49:57.520
<v Speaker 2>of why I didn't get my elk this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1888
01:49:57.521 --> 01:49:59.020
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also,</v>

1889
01:49:59.021 --> 01:49:59.854
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's super important that the </v>

1890
01:50:01.871 --> 01:50:02.704
<v Speaker 2>hunting community step back and </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that these animals are </v>

1891
01:50:04.841 --> 01:50:08.830
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be preyed upon by wolves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that without them you're going to get to</v>

1892
01:50:08.831 --> 01:50:09.664
<v Speaker 2>these enormous overpopulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which had happened in that hundred year </v>

1893
01:50:13.181 --> 01:50:15.710
<v Speaker 2>period when we were reintroducing elk </v>
<v Speaker 2>with no predators.</v>

1894
01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:19.150
<v Speaker 2>They develop diseases and Montana has no</v>
<v Speaker 2>shortage of ALC.</v>

1895
01:50:19.151 --> 01:50:19.984
<v Speaker 2>I was there this summer and we drove by </v>
<v Speaker 2>this house and we had to pull over and </v>

1896
01:50:23.201 --> 01:50:27.600
<v Speaker 2>luckily I had binoculars in my car and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave him my kids and the first time they</v>

1897
01:50:27.630 --> 01:50:29.800
<v Speaker 2>saw elk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a hundred elk on this lawn,</v>

1898
01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:33.250
<v Speaker 2>hundred there were all over the place </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1899
01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:34.113
<v Speaker 2>one of the women who lives there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>explained to us that they had wolves </v>

1900
01:50:36.131 --> 01:50:36.964
<v Speaker 2>come through just a couple of nights </v>
<v Speaker 2>before and it was really exciting and </v>

1901
01:50:39.011 --> 01:50:41.680
<v Speaker 2>everybody's looking out the window and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think if you live there,</v>

1902
01:50:42.370 --> 01:50:43.960
<v Speaker 2>if you're a person who was an elk </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunter,</v>

1903
01:50:43.961 --> 01:50:44.794
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're a lazy one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get where you could see that that </v>

1904
01:50:47.230 --> 01:50:50.350
<v Speaker 2>would be something you would complain </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

1905
01:50:50.351 --> 01:50:52.660
<v Speaker 2>but think the ELC adapt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1906
01:50:52.661 --> 01:50:53.530
<v Speaker 2>they figured it out.</v>

1907
01:50:53.590 --> 01:50:56.560
<v Speaker 2>They don't call as much and people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>complaining about that.</v>

1908
01:50:56.561 --> 01:50:57.394
<v Speaker 2>You don't hear the bugling as much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that bugling was probably a little </v>

1909
01:51:00.911 --> 01:51:01.744
<v Speaker 2>unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get a little too cocky that they </v>

1910
01:51:02.771 --> 01:51:05.080
<v Speaker 2>could just scream and yell whenever they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were breeding.</v>

1911
01:51:05.710 --> 01:51:07.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they got preyed upon.</v>

1912
01:51:07.450 --> 01:51:08.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1913
01:51:08.351 --> 01:51:09.184
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we have to remember is that we are </v>

1914
01:51:11.621 --> 01:51:12.454
<v Speaker 2>newcomers to North America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a very old place and wolves and </v>

1915
01:51:19.811 --> 01:51:20.644
<v Speaker 2>coyotes and mountain lions have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the ecological equation here </v>

1916
01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:29.710
<v Speaker 2>with all of these animals that we like </v>
<v Speaker 2>to hunt with pronghorns,</v>

1917
01:51:29.711 --> 01:51:31.090
<v Speaker 2>with elk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with mule deer.</v>

1918
01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:32.153
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been evolving with one another </v>

1919
01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:38.980
<v Speaker 2>for hundreds of thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean pronghorns,</v>

1920
01:51:38.981 --> 01:51:41.050
<v Speaker 2>I talk about this and the American </v>
<v Speaker 2>Serengeti book,</v>

1921
01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:42.933
<v Speaker 2>pronghorn females always have two fonts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They basically have little litters of </v>

1922
01:51:49.571 --> 01:51:54.571
<v Speaker 2>two and the reason they have to is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because coyotes prey on pronghorn funds.</v>

1923
01:51:55.330 --> 01:52:00.090
<v Speaker 2>And so you basically have an heir and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>spare and the spares,</v>

1924
01:52:00.130 --> 01:52:02.620
<v Speaker 2>the one that you assumed the coyotes are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get.</v>

1925
01:52:02.710 --> 01:52:03.730
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1926
01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:06.320
<v Speaker 2>and they evolve disability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1927
01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:07.173
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think part of it is just coming to </v>

1928
01:52:10.661 --> 01:52:15.661
<v Speaker 2>terms with the fact that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're brand new here and it's gonna take</v>

1929
01:52:17.380 --> 01:52:22.060
<v Speaker 2>awhile for us to actually truly become </v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans in an ecological sense.</v>

1930
01:52:22.061 --> 01:52:22.894
<v Speaker 2>In one way to do it is to think in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these long patterns that extinct </v>

1931
01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:27.393
<v Speaker 2>stand back through time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to talk to you about your paper </v>

1932
01:52:29.470 --> 01:52:34.270
<v Speaker 2>on Bison is called Bison diplomacy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bison ecology or is it the opposite?</v>

1933
01:52:35.370 --> 01:52:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Bison ecology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diplomacy.</v>

1934
01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:38.253
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1935
01:52:38.350 --> 01:52:39.183
<v Speaker 2>And what you were saying was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this I found incredibly fascinating </v>

1936
01:52:43.150 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 2>was that when we came along,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the mark,</v>

1937
01:52:46.101 --> 01:52:48.590
<v Speaker 2>I say we obviously my grandparents were </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrants,</v>

1938
01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:52.190
<v Speaker 2>wasn't me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when Europeans,</v>

1939
01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:53.053
<v Speaker 2>when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that we consider Americans now </v>

1940
01:52:54.921 --> 01:52:55.754
<v Speaker 2>came along a few hundred years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when they started doing the </v>

1941
01:52:58.791 --> 01:53:00.470
<v Speaker 2>market hunting and killing off all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bison,</v>

1942
01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:01.713
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had done was something that the </v>

1943
01:53:03.741 --> 01:53:06.230
<v Speaker 2>native Americans were already on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to doing.</v>

1944
01:53:08.180 --> 01:53:09.760
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1945
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:13.640
<v Speaker 4>so let me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me sort of offer a revision of that.</v>

1946
01:53:13.670 --> 01:53:14.540
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1947
01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:19.190
<v Speaker 4>native people and Bison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1948
01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:24.240
<v Speaker 4>had coexisted in that had been going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>for eight or 9,000 years with,</v>

1949
01:53:24.330 --> 01:53:26.660
<v Speaker 4>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the modern bison.</v>

1950
01:53:26.690 --> 01:53:28.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you track it back to,</v>

1951
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:31.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the large Pleistocene Bison,</v>

1952
01:53:31.641 --> 01:53:34.460
<v Speaker 4>bison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>antiquity and bison latter fronds,</v>

1953
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:36.980
<v Speaker 4>the big Longhorn Bison Longhorn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bison,</v>

1954
01:53:37.190 --> 01:53:38.180
<v Speaker 4>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1955
01:53:38.190 --> 01:53:39.023
<v Speaker 4>amy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1956
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:43.160
<v Speaker 4>It was by some Latin frons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called Lana frons.</v>

1957
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:44.880
<v Speaker 4>Frons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1958
01:53:45.230 --> 01:53:46.063
<v Speaker 4>And so it's a long horn bison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there was a slightly smaller </v>

1959
01:53:50.391 --> 01:53:55.391
<v Speaker 4>one that existed farther into into our </v>
<v Speaker 4>own time or the bison that we experience</v>

1960
01:53:56.390 --> 01:53:59.450
<v Speaker 4>any of these pure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1961
01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:01.070
<v Speaker 4>some herds are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1962
01:54:01.071 --> 01:54:03.080
<v Speaker 4>Look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>

1963
01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:04.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>

1964
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:06.130
<v Speaker 4>that's bias.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of fraud.</v>

1965
01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:06.973
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you're aware of the scrub bowls</v>
<v Speaker 4>like particularly in Australia with </v>

1966
01:54:10.101 --> 01:54:10.934
<v Speaker 4>these animals get free and they become </v>
<v Speaker 4>feral domestic cows change their </v>

1967
01:54:14.781 --> 01:54:17.480
<v Speaker 4>characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the size of that thing.</v>

1968
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:19.570
<v Speaker 4>So what the Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1969
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:24.750
<v Speaker 4>So what that graphic shows is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>contemporary are bison over on the right</v>

1970
01:54:27.951 --> 01:54:32.951
<v Speaker 4>side of the graphic and you can see how </v>
<v Speaker 4>much smaller it is than the animals that</v>

1971
01:54:33.531 --> 01:54:34.364
<v Speaker 4>were here during the pleistocene by some</v>
<v Speaker 4>latter fronds as the animal over on the </v>

1972
01:54:38.751 --> 01:54:39.584
<v Speaker 4>far left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Bison antiquity is one of these in </v>

1973
01:54:43.431 --> 01:54:44.264
<v Speaker 4>the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably the very middle one right </v>

1974
01:54:45.531 --> 01:54:49.850
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These animals were hunted by early human</v>

1975
01:54:49.851 --> 01:54:50.684
<v Speaker 4>hunters here too when the plot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they arrived before the </v>

1976
01:54:52.851 --> 01:54:55.580
<v Speaker 4>pleistocene produced that extinction </v>
<v Speaker 4>scenario.</v>

1977
01:54:55.820 --> 01:55:00.080
<v Speaker 4>So they hunted these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these large forms of Bison,</v>

1978
01:55:00.081 --> 01:55:03.110
<v Speaker 4>but about 8,000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bison,</v>

1979
01:55:04.190 --> 01:55:09.190
<v Speaker 4>the large ones having become extinct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bison sort of evolved into this smaller.</v>

1980
01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:11.293
<v Speaker 4>I mean some people actually refer to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Modern Boston as a dwarf complex </v>

1981
01:55:14.660 --> 01:55:19.130
<v Speaker 4>compared to these older ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what I argue,</v>

1982
01:55:19.131 --> 01:55:19.964
<v Speaker 4>and I've got a chapter on this and </v>
<v Speaker 4>American Serengeti to Sorta my most </v>

1983
01:55:23.361 --> 01:55:27.320
<v Speaker 4>recent take on this bison ecology bison </v>
<v Speaker 4>diplomacy piece,</v>

1984
01:55:27.321 --> 01:55:31.760
<v Speaker 4>which came out in a very fancy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a journal Academic Journal,</v>

1985
01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:33.440
<v Speaker 4>but 25 years ago now.</v>

1986
01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:34.813
<v Speaker 4>But what I argue is that that hunt had </v>
<v Speaker 4>been going on for 8,000 years and </v>

1987
01:55:43.170 --> 01:55:44.003
<v Speaker 4>probably the reason that bison never </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Indians never hunted them to </v>

1988
01:55:48.631 --> 01:55:49.464
<v Speaker 4>extinction is because bison were </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually better adapted to the </v>

1989
01:55:53.221 --> 01:55:54.054
<v Speaker 4>grasslands than people were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they were more successful as a </v>

1990
01:55:58.321 --> 01:55:59.154
<v Speaker 4>grassland species than humans were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Until we get the introduction from the </v>

1991
01:56:06.541 --> 01:56:10.290
<v Speaker 4>European arrival of a couple of things </v>
<v Speaker 4>that change the equation.</v>

1992
01:56:10.350 --> 01:56:14.910
<v Speaker 4>One is the reintroduction of the horse </v>
<v Speaker 4>to North America,</v>

1993
01:56:14.970 --> 01:56:19.970
<v Speaker 4>which native people in the west quickly </v>
<v Speaker 4>take up and gives him a bill.</v>

1994
01:56:20.220 --> 01:56:21.053
<v Speaker 4>An ability to hunt bison far more </v>
<v Speaker 4>efficiently and to become just as well </v>

1995
01:56:24.931 --> 01:56:28.230
<v Speaker 4>adapted to life on the grasslands as the</v>
<v Speaker 4>as the bison was.</v>

1996
01:56:29.190 --> 01:56:30.023
<v Speaker 4>But the other thing that changes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>equation is the market and the </v>

1997
01:56:32.911 --> 01:56:37.911
<v Speaker 4>introduction of the market economy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what that article actually argued</v>

1998
01:56:38.011 --> 01:56:43.011
<v Speaker 4>and what my chapter in American </v>
<v Speaker 4>Serengeti argues to I haven't changed my</v>

1999
01:56:43.171 --> 01:56:44.004
<v Speaker 4>mind over the last 25 years about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the market became a force for </v>

2000
01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:59.510
<v Speaker 4>native people just as it did for people </v>
<v Speaker 4>all around the world in Africa and India</v>

2001
01:57:00.301 --> 01:57:03.990
<v Speaker 4>and everywhere else that they found </v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult to resist.</v>

2002
01:57:04.530 --> 01:57:08.490
<v Speaker 4>And one of the primary reasons they </v>
<v Speaker 4>found it difficult to resist was because</v>

2003
01:57:09.480 --> 01:57:11.580
<v Speaker 4>if you were hunting with flint </v>
<v Speaker 4>arrowheads,</v>

2004
01:57:12.150 --> 01:57:17.150
<v Speaker 4>your best arrowhead maker could maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>produce 15 of them through hard labor in</v>

2005
01:57:19.561 --> 01:57:20.394
<v Speaker 4>a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you could go out and kill a bison </v>

2006
01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:31.610
<v Speaker 4>and have your wife Tan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's pelt and make a robe.</v>

2007
01:57:32.581 --> 01:57:33.414
<v Speaker 4>A softly tan robe out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you could trade that to a white </v>

2008
01:57:37.951 --> 01:57:38.784
<v Speaker 4>trader from the Hudson's Bay company or </v>
<v Speaker 4>the American fur company and they would </v>

2009
01:57:43.891 --> 01:57:48.891
<v Speaker 4>give you a hundred and 50 steel </v>
<v Speaker 4>arrowheads that were far better than the</v>

2010
01:57:50.911 --> 01:57:55.911
<v Speaker 4>flint ones that took your best arrow </v>
<v Speaker 4>maker a day to produce and you could get</v>

2011
01:57:56.540 --> 01:58:01.540
<v Speaker 4>150 of them for the work of 30 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 4>going out and shooting a bison.</v>

2012
01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:06.810
<v Speaker 4>And of course your wife had to spend a </v>
<v Speaker 4>week working on the pill.</v>

2013
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:12.350
<v Speaker 4>But basically the European market had so</v>
<v Speaker 4>many labor saving technologies,</v>

2014
01:58:19.260 --> 01:58:21.840
<v Speaker 4>steel arrowheads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>steel knives,</v>

2015
01:58:21.841 --> 01:58:22.674
<v Speaker 4>steel hatchets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a firearms that it became almost </v>

2016
01:58:29.821 --> 01:58:34.821
<v Speaker 4>impossible for Indian people to resist </v>
<v Speaker 4>trading for those things.</v>

2017
01:58:36.450 --> 01:58:38.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you didn't trade for them and the</v>

2018
01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:39.473
<v Speaker 4>tribe down the river did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they suddenly had guns and you </v>

2019
01:58:43.121 --> 01:58:45.940
<v Speaker 4>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you were going to be out competed</v>

2020
01:58:45.941 --> 01:58:48.700
<v Speaker 4>by your neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so in effect,</v>

2021
01:58:48.701 --> 01:58:49.534
<v Speaker 4>what happened was at the lure of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>goods of the industrial world in the </v>

2022
01:58:53.931 --> 01:58:54.764
<v Speaker 4>market economy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>drew Indian people into the market hunt </v>

2023
01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:01.690
<v Speaker 4>so that by the 18,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20,</v>

2024
01:59:01.740 --> 01:59:03.460
<v Speaker 4>18 thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>18 forties,</v>

2025
01:59:03.610 --> 01:59:04.443
<v Speaker 4>they were still killing buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In order to provide meat for the family </v>

2026
01:59:08.021 --> 01:59:09.430
<v Speaker 4>and to provide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2027
01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:10.313
<v Speaker 4>a hides to make a teepee and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were killing and additional </v>

2028
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:18.550
<v Speaker 4>percentage of animals to trade to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>European market.</v>

2029
01:59:18.970 --> 01:59:19.803
<v Speaker 4>And so they became actors in the market </v>
<v Speaker 4>economy that was basically wiping all </v>

2030
01:59:25.100 --> 01:59:29.770
<v Speaker 4>these animals out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he also was the reintroduction of the</v>

2031
01:59:29.771 --> 01:59:30.820
<v Speaker 4>horse as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2032
01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:31.713
<v Speaker 4>Because I was in before that they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting these animals on foot and they </v>

2033
01:59:34.181 --> 01:59:35.380
<v Speaker 4>were far less effective.</v>

2034
01:59:35.410 --> 01:59:36.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2035
01:59:36.521 --> 01:59:37.240
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

2036
01:59:37.240 --> 01:59:38.073
<v Speaker 4>they're beasts of burden was the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you couldn't travel nearly as </v>

2037
01:59:43.301 --> 01:59:44.134
<v Speaker 4>far,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously by using dog propelled </v>

2038
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:49.690
<v Speaker 4>locomotion as you could horses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2039
01:59:49.691 --> 01:59:53.140
<v Speaker 4>and you couldn't carry the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>burdens,</v>

2040
01:59:53.141 --> 01:59:57.010
<v Speaker 4>that kind of goods that you could carry </v>
<v Speaker 4>on dogs that you could with horses.</v>

2041
01:59:57.011 --> 02:00:02.011
<v Speaker 4>And so the transformation from being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dog propelled people to being a horse.</v>

2042
02:00:02.561 --> 02:00:07.060
<v Speaker 4>Propel people was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a revolution in their lives.</v>

2043
02:00:07.061 --> 02:00:07.894
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in one of the things that happened as a </v>

2044
02:00:09.071 --> 02:00:10.240
<v Speaker 4>result of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was it?</v>

2045
02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:14.590
<v Speaker 4>There were people all around the borders</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the plains,</v>

2046
02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:15.663
<v Speaker 4>many of whom were agriculturalists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are farmers who ended up especially </v>

2047
02:00:21.491 --> 02:00:26.491
<v Speaker 4>their young men,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ended up abandoning farming because they</v>

2048
02:00:28.721 --> 02:00:29.554
<v Speaker 4>realized that the potential for rising </v>
<v Speaker 4>and status and for creating a better </v>

2049
02:00:35.021 --> 02:00:35.854
<v Speaker 4>life was much higher if you match it up </v>
<v Speaker 4>on a horse and rode out into the plains </v>

2050
02:00:38.921 --> 02:00:39.754
<v Speaker 4>and hunted buffalo.</v>

2051
02:00:40.570 --> 02:00:42.390
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2052
02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:47.400
<v Speaker 4>there were entire groups like the crows </v>
<v Speaker 4>had been relatives of demand.</v>

2053
02:00:47.410 --> 02:00:48.243
<v Speaker 4>Dan's in the adult says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and had been agriculturalists and that </v>

2054
02:00:50.950 --> 02:00:53.090
<v Speaker 4>entire group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2055
02:00:53.650 --> 02:00:57.250
<v Speaker 4>ended up abandoning farming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mattered up on horses,</v>

2056
02:00:57.251 --> 02:00:59.110
<v Speaker 4>rode down to the planes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>become buffalo hunters.</v>

2057
02:00:59.470 --> 02:01:00.303
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>during the period from basically about </v>

2058
02:01:01.841 --> 02:01:03.400
<v Speaker 4>17,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20,</v>

2059
02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:06.850
<v Speaker 4>when a lot of the people in the west </v>
<v Speaker 4>began to acquire horses.</v>

2060
02:01:06.851 --> 02:01:07.684
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2061
02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:09.400
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spread horses,</v>

2062
02:01:09.790 --> 02:01:12.760
<v Speaker 4>as I mentioned earlier in our </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation,</v>

2063
02:01:12.761 --> 02:01:15.160
<v Speaker 4>was basically in 16,</v>
<v Speaker 4>80,</v>

2064
02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:16.743
<v Speaker 4>the Pueblo Indians down in New Mexico </v>
<v Speaker 4>rose up against the Spanish colonists </v>

2065
02:01:22.630 --> 02:01:26.140
<v Speaker 4>and drove them out of New Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in the process,</v>

2066
02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:29.320
<v Speaker 4>they captured all their herds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>livestock.</v>

2067
02:01:29.410 --> 02:01:30.243
<v Speaker 4>They captured their goats,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their sheep and their horse hurts and </v>

2068
02:01:34.451 --> 02:01:35.284
<v Speaker 4>some animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some of the horses got loose and it's </v>

2069
02:01:37.261 --> 02:01:38.094
<v Speaker 4>sort of the origin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least one of the origins of the wild </v>

2070
02:01:39.921 --> 02:01:41.540
<v Speaker 4>horses that spread across the West.</v>

2071
02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:43.153
<v Speaker 4>But the Pueblo Indians trade the sheep </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the goats to the people who become </v>

2072
02:01:46.851 --> 02:01:47.684
<v Speaker 4>the Navajos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They become herders of goats and sheep </v>

2073
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:50.743
<v Speaker 4>and they start trading the horses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they have now in great surplus </v>

2074
02:01:54.291 --> 02:01:55.124
<v Speaker 4>that they've liberated from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Spaniards up the mountains from one </v>

2075
02:01:58.011 --> 02:01:59.720
<v Speaker 4>tribe to another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the youth,</v>

2076
02:01:59.750 --> 02:02:01.700
<v Speaker 4>to the shoney's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the Nez perce,</v>

2077
02:02:01.701 --> 02:02:03.280
<v Speaker 4>to the black feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2078
02:02:03.290 --> 02:02:06.350
<v Speaker 4>to the essential ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then on out on the plains.</v>

2079
02:02:06.351 --> 02:02:09.890
<v Speaker 4>And so from a 16,</v>
<v Speaker 4>80 through about 17,</v>

2080
02:02:09.891 --> 02:02:12.560
<v Speaker 4>20 or 70 slash 30,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just about everybody in the west ends up</v>

2081
02:02:12.561 --> 02:02:15.950
<v Speaker 4>getting horses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you have to have the culture with it</v>

2082
02:02:15.951 --> 02:02:16.401
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2083
02:02:16.401 --> 02:02:19.070
<v Speaker 4>you can't just hand the animal over to </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody.</v>

2084
02:02:19.071 --> 02:02:19.904
<v Speaker 4>And there's a famous story where the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first horse that the blackfeet say they </v>

2085
02:02:24.051 --> 02:02:29.051
<v Speaker 4>offer it buffalo meat to eight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And somebody has to say as a Kalispell,</v>

2086
02:02:30.051 --> 02:02:31.490
<v Speaker 4>Indiana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's riding the horses?</v>

2087
02:02:31.530 --> 02:02:32.240
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2088
02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:34.640
<v Speaker 4>not buffalo meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It eats grass.</v>

2089
02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:37.130
<v Speaker 4>It grazes on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to feed it grass.</v>

2090
02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:38.413
<v Speaker 4>And they have to be shown how to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>care of horses and how to Gal stallions </v>

2091
02:02:42.681 --> 02:02:46.160
<v Speaker 4>and how to ride them and how to break </v>
<v Speaker 4>them and the whole bit.</v>

2092
02:02:46.161 --> 02:02:50.780
<v Speaker 4>So there's a culture that goes with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but once they acquire them,</v>

2093
02:02:51.290 --> 02:02:52.123
<v Speaker 4>and this period that only lasts for </v>
<v Speaker 4>about 200 years of the famous horse </v>

2094
02:02:56.661 --> 02:02:59.600
<v Speaker 4>mounted buffalo hunting plains Indian </v>
<v Speaker 4>emerges,</v>

2095
02:03:00.110 --> 02:03:00.943
<v Speaker 4>that lifestyle becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is kind of a backward step really </v>

2096
02:03:03.981 --> 02:03:06.380
<v Speaker 4>in anthropological terms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You assume that,</v>

2097
02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:07.243
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go from hunting to be in farmer and </v>

2098
02:03:08.871 --> 02:03:11.150
<v Speaker 4>you go from farmer to being a city </v>
<v Speaker 4>dweller.</v>

2099
02:03:11.570 --> 02:03:12.403
<v Speaker 4>This is a step going back the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it proved to be so compelling to so </v>

2100
02:03:17.481 --> 02:03:19.760
<v Speaker 4>many people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I said earlier,</v>

2101
02:03:19.970 --> 02:03:20.803
<v Speaker 4>especially young men who often in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>farming communities didn't have much </v>

2102
02:03:24.201 --> 02:03:25.034
<v Speaker 4>opportunity for upward mobility,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can mount up on that horse and </v>

2103
02:03:28.791 --> 02:03:31.250
<v Speaker 4>ride out and become buffalo hunter and </v>
<v Speaker 4>men,</v>

2104
02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:33.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world was your oyster.</v>

2105
02:03:33.610 --> 02:03:34.443
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So was essentially the influence of the </v>

2106
02:03:35.601 --> 02:03:40.601
<v Speaker 4>Europeans coming here and offering up </v>
<v Speaker 4>the market and creating this environment</v>

2107
02:03:40.611 --> 02:03:44.240
<v Speaker 4>where they were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was really profitable now and so.</v>

2108
02:03:44.300 --> 02:03:48.680
<v Speaker 4>And it became kind of something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>native people almost couldn't escape.</v>

2109
02:03:49.190 --> 02:03:51.020
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't get away from it because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>mean,</v>

2110
02:03:51.021 --> 02:03:52.250
<v Speaker 4>there were some groups that said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2111
02:03:52.251 --> 02:03:54.020
<v Speaker 4>we're not going to participate in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2112
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:55.303
<v Speaker 4>but that immediately disadvantaged them </v>
<v Speaker 4>compared to the group right down the </v>

2113
02:04:00.141 --> 02:04:03.920
<v Speaker 4>river.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so people who didn't participate,</v>

2114
02:04:03.921 --> 02:04:04.754
<v Speaker 4>we're pretty quickly overrun by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who became fully engaged in the </v>

2115
02:04:10.011 --> 02:04:14.870
<v Speaker 4>horse hunt and the market hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I mean there are instances where,</v>

2116
02:04:14.871 --> 02:04:17.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Su and people,</v>

2117
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:18.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the movies,</v>

2118
02:04:18.650 --> 02:04:19.483
<v Speaker 4>the Lakotas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they basically march across the </v>

2119
02:04:22.010 --> 02:04:23.720
<v Speaker 4>northern West,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like pac man,</v>

2120
02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:24.973
<v Speaker 4>once they acquire horses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they come out of Minnesota and out of </v>

2121
02:04:27.411 --> 02:04:28.244
<v Speaker 4>the woodlands and March across the West,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gobbling up one tribe after another and </v>

2122
02:04:31.911 --> 02:04:34.370
<v Speaker 4>taking away their buffalo hunting </v>
<v Speaker 4>territory.</v>

2123
02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:36.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're still doing it down to the time,</v>

2124
02:04:37.050 --> 02:04:37.883
<v Speaker 4>the battle of the little big horn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why the crow's feet on the side </v>

2125
02:04:40.681 --> 02:04:41.514
<v Speaker 4>of the United States at the battle of </v>
<v Speaker 4>little big horn is because the lakotas </v>

2126
02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:47.273
<v Speaker 4>are seizing their countryside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Go Lakota is what they call </v>

2127
02:04:51.001 --> 02:04:53.690
<v Speaker 4>themselves and other native Americans </v>
<v Speaker 4>call them the Su,</v>

2128
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:58.200
<v Speaker 4>which means enemy and the word that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've used in history as the Sioux,</v>

2129
02:04:58.350 --> 02:04:59.183
<v Speaker 4>but I mean I'm on the southern plains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Comanche's did basically the same </v>

2130
02:05:02.731 --> 02:05:06.810
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They created this empire that was really</v>

2131
02:05:07.140 --> 02:05:11.100
<v Speaker 4>on a par and able to compete with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Spanish empire,</v>

2132
02:05:11.101 --> 02:05:11.934
<v Speaker 4>with the Republic of Texas and even for </v>
<v Speaker 4>awhile against the United States and </v>

2133
02:05:16.111 --> 02:05:16.944
<v Speaker 4>they created it around this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This horse propelled bison hunt that </v>

2134
02:05:24.001 --> 02:05:24.834
<v Speaker 4>provided goods for the market economy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you were talking about steel </v>

2135
02:05:29.041 --> 02:05:30.990
<v Speaker 4>arrowheads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they,</v>

2136
02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:36.280
<v Speaker 4>or when did they start using firearms?</v>
<v Speaker 4>While I started using firearms?</v>

2137
02:05:36.630 --> 02:05:37.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

2138
02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:38.133
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an early trade item and it was usually </v>

2139
02:05:39.871 --> 02:05:40.704
<v Speaker 4>in the very beginning of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of contact between Europeans and native </v>

2140
02:05:44.161 --> 02:05:46.380
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A firearm was,</v>

2141
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:49.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe a couple of them were given to the</v>

2142
02:05:49.170 --> 02:05:52.440
<v Speaker 4>headman to the leaders of particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribe as a status item.</v>

2143
02:05:53.460 --> 02:05:54.293
<v Speaker 4>One time I was an editor on a forum </v>
<v Speaker 4>anthropological journal called Ethno </v>

2144
02:06:00.151 --> 02:06:03.690
<v Speaker 4>history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my task as a,</v>

2145
02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:05.140
<v Speaker 4>an editor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a cyst,</v>

2146
02:06:05.141 --> 02:06:06.780
<v Speaker 4>an editor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>associate editor or something.</v>

2147
02:06:06.781 --> 02:06:07.614
<v Speaker 4>But my task was to read the the incoming</v>
<v Speaker 4>manuscripts that were submitted for </v>

2148
02:06:11.521 --> 02:06:13.890
<v Speaker 4>publication,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and one of the ones I read,</v>

2149
02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:18.920
<v Speaker 4>I've never forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was an account by a trader in South</v>

2150
02:06:22.710 --> 02:06:27.710
<v Speaker 4>America who was turning his trading post</v>
<v Speaker 4>over to a newly arriving trader.</v>

2151
02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:34.480
<v Speaker 4>I think they were Portuguese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this trader who had experience in</v>

2152
02:06:34.531 --> 02:06:37.440
<v Speaker 4>the area was queried by the new guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>said,</v>

2153
02:06:37.441 --> 02:06:40.830
<v Speaker 4>so how do I get the Indians to trade </v>
<v Speaker 4>with me?</v>

2154
02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:46.560
<v Speaker 4>And the guy who had been on the scene </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a while said nothing to it,</v>

2155
02:06:48.030 --> 02:06:53.030
<v Speaker 4>ride out 15 or 20 miles into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wilderness and take a steel ax</v>

2156
02:06:56.510 --> 02:06:57.343
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

2157
02:06:57.660 --> 02:07:00.700
<v Speaker 4>suspended from a rope from the branch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>a tree</v>

2158
02:07:01.770 --> 02:07:03.900
<v Speaker 1>and then leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>

2159
02:07:04.650 --> 02:07:06.990
<v Speaker 4>two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three weeks later go back.</v>

2160
02:07:08.370 --> 02:07:10.560
<v Speaker 4>And this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this new trader,</v>

2161
02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:11.453
<v Speaker 4>did exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he went back two weeks later to the </v>

2162
02:07:13.621 --> 02:07:14.454
<v Speaker 4>spot that's clearing in the forest and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Amazonian forest where he had tied </v>

2163
02:07:17.911 --> 02:07:22.911
<v Speaker 4>this double bladed steel ax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there were hundreds of native people</v>

2164
02:07:23.370 --> 02:07:28.370
<v Speaker 4>gathered around the spot wanting more of</v>
<v Speaker 4>these objects were or have these access.</v>

2165
02:07:31.741 --> 02:07:34.890
<v Speaker 4>Because steel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a famous.</v>

2166
02:07:35.260 --> 02:07:38.710
<v Speaker 4>When Captain Cook first puts off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>coast,</v>

2167
02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:43.980
<v Speaker 4>off the Waimea coast of Hawaii and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Hawaiian people paddle there,</v>

2168
02:07:44.771 --> 02:07:45.604
<v Speaker 4>outriggers out and climb on board his </v>
<v Speaker 4>ships and immediately start pulling all </v>

2169
02:07:49.961 --> 02:07:50.794
<v Speaker 4>the nails out of the planking on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ship and diving off into the water with </v>

2170
02:07:55.451 --> 02:07:56.284
<v Speaker 4>the nails because they want metal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They realized this is such an advantage </v>

2171
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:06.510
<v Speaker 4>over the technology that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I mean,</v>

2172
02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:11.020
<v Speaker 4>they're willing to trade what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you want for an x?</v>

2173
02:08:11.470 --> 02:08:14.380
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you want for a box of nails?</v>

2174
02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:19.360
<v Speaker 4>So they just let the people know that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the acs was a thing hanging from a tree,</v>

2175
02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:22.510
<v Speaker 4>leaving for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let him play with it and go back.</v>

2176
02:08:22.890 --> 02:08:24.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2177
02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:27.610
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a mindblower.</v>

2178
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:33.030
<v Speaker 4>So that's how how native people kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>all over the world who hadn't progressed</v>

2179
02:08:34.210 --> 02:08:35.043
<v Speaker 4>to the iron revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the Iron Age were seduced into the </v>

2180
02:08:40.241 --> 02:08:41.074
<v Speaker 4>market economy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that they were offered items that </v>

2181
02:08:44.261 --> 02:08:45.094
<v Speaker 4>were so compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as I have said a couple of times </v>

2182
02:08:49.031 --> 02:08:49.930
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you.</v>

2183
02:08:49.960 --> 02:08:50.793
<v Speaker 4>If you didn't participate in it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you kind of within a decade you were </v>

2184
02:08:54.881 --> 02:08:55.714
<v Speaker 4>disadvantaged because everybody around </v>
<v Speaker 4>you was going to end up doing it and so </v>

2185
02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:03.250
<v Speaker 4>you got caught up in it and so that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>how.</v>

2186
02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:07.780
<v Speaker 4>That's how what I was arguing in Bison </v>
<v Speaker 4>ecology and vice and diplomacy m and and</v>

2187
02:09:07.790 --> 02:09:08.623
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I the argument is slightly revised and </v>

2188
02:09:11.530 --> 02:09:12.363
<v Speaker 4>American Serengeti,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's the same argument and it's </v>

2189
02:09:14.081 --> 02:09:14.914
<v Speaker 4>become the prevailing argument about </v>
<v Speaker 4>what happened to bison and the 19th </v>

2190
02:09:18.221 --> 02:09:19.054
<v Speaker 4>century is we used to think that okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were still 100 million of them by </v>

2191
02:09:23.230 --> 02:09:24.063
<v Speaker 4>the end of the civil war and then guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>go out with rifles in the space of 20 </v>

2192
02:09:27.011 --> 02:09:27.250
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

2193
02:09:27.250 --> 02:09:28.083
<v Speaker 4>They shoot them all down and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>end of it for their tongues and further </v>

2194
02:09:30.581 --> 02:09:34.810
<v Speaker 4>hides,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what the story actually is is a much</v>

2195
02:09:34.811 --> 02:09:35.644
<v Speaker 4>more believable and real story that it </v>
<v Speaker 4>has to do with the introduction of </v>

2196
02:09:40.901 --> 02:09:41.734
<v Speaker 4>horses which drink water and graze grass</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that reduces the carrying </v>

2197
02:09:45.191 --> 02:09:49.300
<v Speaker 4>capacity for Bison wants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are two or 3 million horses out on</v>

2198
02:09:49.301 --> 02:09:51.730
<v Speaker 4>the plains.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There can't be as many bison anymore.</v>

2199
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:53.223
<v Speaker 4>It happens because there is a climate </v>
<v Speaker 4>downturn in the 1840 [inaudible] for </v>

2200
02:09:58.031 --> 02:09:58.864
<v Speaker 4>about 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a drought and that reduces the </v>

2201
02:10:01.151 --> 02:10:04.360
<v Speaker 4>carrying capacity for Bison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So climate plays a role.</v>

2202
02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:05.783
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we know that diseases like anthrax and </v>

2203
02:10:10.961 --> 02:10:11.794
<v Speaker 4>ultimately brucellosis get among the </v>
<v Speaker 4>buffalo herds and those diseases </v>

2204
02:10:14.921 --> 02:10:15.754
<v Speaker 4>probably got among the buffalo herds </v>
<v Speaker 4>because oxygen and other animals on the </v>

2205
02:10:19.271 --> 02:10:20.104
<v Speaker 4>overland trails took these European </v>
<v Speaker 4>exotic diseases out among the bison </v>

2206
02:10:24.551 --> 02:10:26.710
<v Speaker 4>herds and infected them with disease.</v>

2207
02:10:27.340 --> 02:10:32.340
<v Speaker 4>And then there is no question that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way the market worked it was mean.</v>

2208
02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:35.090
<v Speaker 4>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course no regulation of it.</v>

2209
02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:37.700
<v Speaker 4>This is before we ever regulate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2210
02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:38.623
<v Speaker 4>we have any environmental regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a free for all capitalist </v>

2211
02:10:42.731 --> 02:10:44.930
<v Speaker 4>world also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No refrigeration,</v>

2212
02:10:45.020 --> 02:10:45.853
<v Speaker 4>the refrigeration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you had to kill it and eat it within </v>

2213
02:10:47.811 --> 02:10:49.790
<v Speaker 4>a certain time period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>

2214
02:10:49.850 --> 02:10:50.683
<v Speaker 4>you can find a mate and that and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>dry climate you can dry it and preserve </v>

2215
02:10:54.601 --> 02:10:57.350
<v Speaker 4>some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

2216
02:10:57.351 --> 02:10:59.900
<v Speaker 4>there's no refrigeration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2217
02:11:00.620 --> 02:11:01.453
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I mean there's no refrigeration </v>

2218
02:11:03.471 --> 02:11:05.420
<v Speaker 4>thing really plays a role in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>

2219
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:09.690
<v Speaker 4>the famous buffalo jumps that happen in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the West because you know,</v>

2220
02:11:09.691 --> 02:11:12.890
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't control how many animals </v>
<v Speaker 4>were going to go off those jumps.</v>

2221
02:11:12.891 --> 02:11:13.724
<v Speaker 4>And so if you wanted to run 10 off in </v>
<v Speaker 4>order to provide you with buffalo for </v>

2222
02:11:18.171 --> 02:11:19.004
<v Speaker 4>the next month and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your tribe of 125 with Buffalo Buffalo </v>

2223
02:11:22.191 --> 02:11:22.460
<v Speaker 4>jumps.</v>

2224
02:11:22.460 --> 02:11:24.200
<v Speaker 4>Been running them off cliffs running off</v>
<v Speaker 4>cliffs.</v>

2225
02:11:24.201 --> 02:11:28.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you wanted to run off 10 and instead</v>

2226
02:11:28.221 --> 02:11:30.710
<v Speaker 4>you got into a herd of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2227
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:31.663
<v Speaker 4>1300,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1300 and they all went off and it even </v>

2228
02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:38.900
<v Speaker 4>became this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we know about these buffalo jumps</v>

2229
02:11:38.901 --> 02:11:39.734
<v Speaker 4>that people regard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Indian people regarded this as a </v>

2230
02:11:41.610 --> 02:11:46.610
<v Speaker 4>stratagem that you don't want to let </v>
<v Speaker 4>surviving buffalo go out onto the plains</v>

2231
02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:51.493
<v Speaker 4>and inform other buffalo that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>this thing called a jump that you want </v>

2232
02:11:55.431 --> 02:11:56.264
<v Speaker 4>to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that they end up wanting to make </v>

2233
02:11:58.821 --> 02:11:59.654
<v Speaker 4>sure that they get every single animal </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're driving so that you don't </v>

2234
02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:08.450
<v Speaker 4>have buffalo go off and tell other </v>
<v Speaker 4>buffalo how this works.</v>

2235
02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:09.513
<v Speaker 4>But it's going to sound crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it makes you wonder if it was </v>

2236
02:12:12.170 --> 02:12:13.003
<v Speaker 4>ignorance on their part that the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these animals could communicate like </v>

2237
02:12:15.531 --> 02:12:20.531
<v Speaker 4>that or if they had some sort of an </v>
<v Speaker 4>intuition about how instincts and how,</v>

2238
02:12:22.040 --> 02:12:25.760
<v Speaker 4>how certain fears that animals had were </v>
<v Speaker 4>developed.</v>

2239
02:12:27.110 --> 02:12:28.130
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

2240
02:12:28.630 --> 02:12:29.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

2241
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:30.263
<v Speaker 4>I spent some time talking about this and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Buffalo Chapter in American </v>

2242
02:12:33.561 --> 02:12:35.200
<v Speaker 4>Serengeti,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2243
02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:41.000
<v Speaker 4>it has to do with what we would call </v>
<v Speaker 4>native science,</v>

2244
02:12:41.330 --> 02:12:42.163
<v Speaker 4>what you mentioned at the last there </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they do understand and they've </v>

2245
02:12:46.671 --> 02:12:49.340
<v Speaker 4>probably seen examples of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2246
02:12:49.370 --> 02:12:53.360
<v Speaker 4>an animal learning very quickly how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>avoid a trap.</v>

2247
02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:55.813
<v Speaker 4>But it also has to do with the cause </v>
<v Speaker 4>effect explanation that they have for </v>

2248
02:13:00.231 --> 02:13:05.231
<v Speaker 4>how the world works and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't have this kind of,</v>

2249
02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:06.133
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Western explanation for this is a cause </v>

2250
02:13:10.220 --> 02:13:15.220
<v Speaker 4>and this is an effect they have on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause effect relationship to be sure.</v>

2251
02:13:15.381 --> 02:13:18.560
<v Speaker 4>But it explains the world in a different</v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

2252
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:20.143
<v Speaker 4>And Indian people pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty generally believed that bison </v>

2253
02:13:25.281 --> 02:13:26.114
<v Speaker 4>were a people that they were a family of</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals and they had families that were </v>

2254
02:13:31.831 --> 02:13:32.664
<v Speaker 4>very similar to the families at any and </v>
<v Speaker 4>people had and they had a controlling </v>

2255
02:13:36.810 --> 02:13:37.643
<v Speaker 4>master animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a buffalo master who you had to </v>

2256
02:13:41.551 --> 02:13:42.384
<v Speaker 4>appeal to to get the animals to give </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves up to humans for the good of </v>

2257
02:13:49.650 --> 02:13:50.483
<v Speaker 4>humanity.</v>

2258
02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:55.880
<v Speaker 4>And so the idea was that you had this </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of,</v>

2259
02:13:58.020 --> 02:14:00.450
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2260
02:14:00.451 --> 02:14:05.160
<v Speaker 4>a theory or tie to these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a tie that we would explain.</v>

2261
02:14:05.161 --> 02:14:06.270
<v Speaker 4>Now looking back on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we would say,</v>

2262
02:14:06.271 --> 02:14:07.530
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a religious thing.</v>

2263
02:14:07.531 --> 02:14:08.364
<v Speaker 4>This was some sort of spiritual kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding of how people and animals </v>

2264
02:14:13.110 --> 02:14:17.010
<v Speaker 4>interacted with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it was informed a little bit by kind</v>

2265
02:14:17.011 --> 02:14:22.011
<v Speaker 4>of native scientific observation too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think in particular this one where</v>

2266
02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:26.730
<v Speaker 4>the argument was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's from what I've read,</v>

2267
02:14:26.731 --> 02:14:29.130
<v Speaker 4>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was pretty widespread that if you did</v>

2268
02:14:29.131 --> 02:14:29.964
<v Speaker 4>a buffalo jump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you needed to kill all the animals that </v>

2269
02:14:31.971 --> 02:14:34.320
<v Speaker 4>went off the jump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't let any of them get away.</v>

2270
02:14:34.650 --> 02:14:35.483
<v Speaker 4>I think that probably was more in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>line of kind of native science because </v>

2271
02:14:39.631 --> 02:14:40.464
<v Speaker 4>they maybe had observed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're being instances where an animal </v>

2272
02:14:44.011 --> 02:14:47.490
<v Speaker 4>that had gone off a jump and had </v>
<v Speaker 4>survived.</v>

2273
02:14:48.090 --> 02:14:50.670
<v Speaker 4>The next time you encountered that </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal.</v>

2274
02:14:50.671 --> 02:14:51.504
<v Speaker 4>It might be particularly marked with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>white patch on a hip or something and a </v>

2275
02:14:55.980 --> 02:14:56.813
<v Speaker 4>few months later you saw that particular</v>
<v Speaker 4>animal and another group of Bison and </v>

2276
02:14:59.671 --> 02:15:00.504
<v Speaker 4>when you try to do a jump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it led that hurt off in a different </v>

2277
02:15:02.491 --> 02:15:03.324
<v Speaker 4>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I think there was kind of native </v>

2278
02:15:05.701 --> 02:15:07.420
<v Speaker 4>science in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the.</v>

2279
02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:08.273
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where we got to and talking about this </v>

2280
02:15:09.901 --> 02:15:10.734
<v Speaker 4>was no refrigeration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you ran 1300 of them off and it's </v>

2281
02:15:14.641 --> 02:15:15.474
<v Speaker 4>August,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then all you're going to get to do and </v>

2282
02:15:18.361 --> 02:15:19.194
<v Speaker 4>you've got a group of 125 people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All you're going to get to do is to </v>

2283
02:15:21.871 --> 02:15:22.704
<v Speaker 4>basically take the best pieces off about</v>
<v Speaker 4>25 or 30 animals and you're going to </v>

2284
02:15:29.231 --> 02:15:30.064
<v Speaker 4>lose the rest of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you can't preserve the meat of </v>

2285
02:15:32.521 --> 02:15:33.354
<v Speaker 4>all those animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they find these sites where they'd </v>

2286
02:15:35.121 --> 02:15:37.380
<v Speaker 4>just be masked carcasses or mass bones.</v>

2287
02:15:37.500 --> 02:15:38.400
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2288
02:15:38.440 --> 02:15:42.930
<v Speaker 4>There's a site in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's called a bonfire shelter site,</v>

2289
02:15:43.170 --> 02:15:45.810
<v Speaker 4>and the reason it's called that </v>
<v Speaker 4>anthropologists gave it.</v>

2290
02:15:45.811 --> 02:15:46.644
<v Speaker 4>There are archeologists gave it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This name is because there was a bison </v>

2291
02:15:49.831 --> 02:15:50.664
<v Speaker 4>jump that was so big there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We think about 10,000 years ago during </v>

2292
02:15:54.931 --> 02:15:55.764
<v Speaker 4>the folsom period that and so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals went off that jump and only a </v>

2293
02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:01.433
<v Speaker 4>few of them could be harvested by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people who did the jump that that big </v>

2294
02:16:05.191 --> 02:16:06.024
<v Speaker 4>mass of animals sat there and basically </v>
<v Speaker 4>over two or three weeks of time burst </v>

2295
02:16:14.311 --> 02:16:19.311
<v Speaker 4>into spontaneous combustion and scorched</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cliff that they had gone off of.</v>

2296
02:16:21.241 --> 02:16:22.074
<v Speaker 4>And so when whites first saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they thought somebody has built a giant </v>

2297
02:16:27.271 --> 02:16:30.700
<v Speaker 4>bonfire at the of that cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

2298
02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:34.300
<v Speaker 4>It's strict a hundred feet up the side </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the cliff.</v>

2299
02:16:34.770 --> 02:16:35.603
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what archeologists realized about it </v>

2300
02:16:37.181 --> 02:16:41.140
<v Speaker 4>when they begin investigating it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it had been a huge mass of bison,</v>

2301
02:16:41.141 --> 02:16:41.974
<v Speaker 4>driven off a cliff that had burst in hot</v>
<v Speaker 4>weather and the spontaneous combustion </v>

2302
02:16:46.631 --> 02:16:48.580
<v Speaker 4>and probably burned for four or five </v>
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>

2303
02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:51.310
<v Speaker 4>How does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did they,</v>

2304
02:16:51.590 --> 02:16:54.130
<v Speaker 4>how do they burst into flames?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2305
02:16:54.131 --> 02:16:59.131
<v Speaker 4>I mean in hot weather with that much </v>
<v Speaker 4>decay and fermentation of all the juices</v>

2306
02:16:59.831 --> 02:17:00.664
<v Speaker 4>that are in intestines and stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you basically create a condition where </v>

2307
02:17:04.121 --> 02:17:07.330
<v Speaker 4>you've got flammable chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That</v>

2308
02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:13.000
<v Speaker 4>lights put what causes the ignition?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2309
02:17:13.001 --> 02:17:13.751
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2310
02:17:13.751 --> 02:17:16.840
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the explanation I've read </v>
<v Speaker 4>is spontaneous,</v>

2311
02:17:16.841 --> 02:17:17.674
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody may have walked over with a </v>

2312
02:17:19.451 --> 02:17:24.090
<v Speaker 4>torch and tossed it onto the pile of </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals and burn them.</v>

2313
02:17:24.190 --> 02:17:27.250
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thousands of animals.</v>

2314
02:17:27.730 --> 02:17:28.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thousands of them.</v>

2315
02:17:29.330 --> 02:17:30.163
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting where you're talking </v>

2316
02:17:30.571 --> 02:17:31.404
<v Speaker 2>about with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm explaining this idea that if one of </v>

2317
02:17:34.921 --> 02:17:37.260
<v Speaker 2>them survived that they would inform the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other ones.</v>

2318
02:17:37.590 --> 02:17:39.750
<v Speaker 2>There was a study that was done recently</v>
<v Speaker 2>on mice,</v>

2319
02:17:40.110 --> 02:17:45.030
<v Speaker 2>and this is a direct genetic study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it might not be totally related,</v>

2320
02:17:45.031 --> 02:17:45.864
<v Speaker 2>but it might be in some ways they took </v>
<v Speaker 2>these mice and they spray to citrus </v>

2321
02:17:50.611 --> 02:17:51.444
<v Speaker 2>smell in their cage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then when they smelled the citrus </v>

2322
02:17:55.171 --> 02:17:56.490
<v Speaker 2>smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they shocked them.</v>

2323
02:17:56.640 --> 02:17:57.473
<v Speaker 2>They shock their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had the bottom floor of the cage </v>

2324
02:17:59.851 --> 02:18:00.684
<v Speaker 2>was electrically charged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and every time they sprayed that citrus </v>

2325
02:18:04.171 --> 02:18:05.400
<v Speaker 2>smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would give them a zap.</v>

2326
02:18:05.850 --> 02:18:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Then their ancestors who had never </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced this before,</v>

2327
02:18:10.860 --> 02:18:13.830
<v Speaker 2>they did the same thing to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sprayed the citrus smell.</v>

2328
02:18:13.860 --> 02:18:18.210
<v Speaker 2>And they had a physical reaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a heightened sense of danger,</v>

2329
02:18:18.330 --> 02:18:20.440
<v Speaker 2>fear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2330
02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:21.393
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they realized that a shock was coming </v>

2331
02:18:23.370 --> 02:18:25.740
<v Speaker 2>just by the smell that citrus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were terrified of it.</v>

2332
02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense that instincts are passed</v>

2333
02:18:28.441 --> 02:18:29.274
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

2334
02:18:29.330 --> 02:18:30.530
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>

2335
02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:31.453
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

2336
02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:36.950
<v Speaker 4>we've sort of concluded from studies </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have been done primarily in Italy,</v>

2337
02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:37.833
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>over,</v>

2338
02:18:38.390 --> 02:18:39.223
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>studying families through the </v>

2339
02:18:41.331 --> 02:18:43.970
<v Speaker 4>generations and Italy that</v>

2340
02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:47.833
<v Speaker 4>descendants of a particular group of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people will preserve evidence in their </v>

2341
02:18:53.601 --> 02:18:56.030
<v Speaker 4>jeans sometimes four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five,</v>

2342
02:18:56.031 --> 02:18:56.864
<v Speaker 4>six generations down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A timeline of an ancestor who went </v>

2343
02:19:01.641 --> 02:19:02.474
<v Speaker 4>through a famine or a starving time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so that famine would produce a </v>

2344
02:19:09.291 --> 02:19:10.124
<v Speaker 4>physiological effect on the body and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be passed down so that </v>

2345
02:19:15.441 --> 02:19:20.441
<v Speaker 4>geneticists could discover effects of it</v>
<v Speaker 4>several generations down the timeline.</v>

2346
02:19:22.490 --> 02:19:25.730
<v Speaker 4>So it's sort of similar to what you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>describing with,</v>

2347
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:29.960
<v Speaker 4>with mice and think that's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2348
02:19:29.961 --> 02:19:30.794
<v Speaker 4>we just said we haven't studied,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least I'm not aware that there had </v>

2349
02:19:32.751 --> 02:19:34.730
<v Speaker 4>been a lot of studies of this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

2350
02:19:34.731 --> 02:19:35.610
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2351
02:19:35.730 --> 02:19:39.200
<v Speaker 4>what it really kind of means is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're the products,</v>

2352
02:19:39.940 --> 02:19:41.170
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2353
02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:42.013
<v Speaker 4>in our modern world of things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happened to our ancestors maybe two or </v>

2354
02:19:45.981 --> 02:19:46.814
<v Speaker 4>300 years ago and maybe even the fears </v>
<v Speaker 4>like they think that Arachnophobia and </v>

2355
02:19:50.540 --> 02:19:51.373
<v Speaker 4>video phobia and a lot of the fears of </v>
<v Speaker 4>snakes and bugs and things that people </v>

2356
02:19:54.741 --> 02:19:55.574
<v Speaker 4>have might be directly attributed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>ancestors being bitten or poisoned by </v>

2357
02:19:58.341 --> 02:19:59.150
<v Speaker 4>those things.</v>

2358
02:19:59.150 --> 02:20:01.820
<v Speaker 4>Or a seeing someone getting bitten or </v>
<v Speaker 4>poisoned by them.</v>

2359
02:20:02.450 --> 02:20:04.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>speaking of that sort of thing.</v>

2360
02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:04.730
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2361
02:20:04.730 --> 02:20:09.020
<v Speaker 4>there's a section I do and when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about the development of poisons</v>

2362
02:20:09.021 --> 02:20:11.540
<v Speaker 4>to try to eradicate coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2363
02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:12.490
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2364
02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:13.513
<v Speaker 4>cody America book where the reason </v>
<v Speaker 4>during World War II we decided are the </v>

2365
02:20:19.371 --> 02:20:22.970
<v Speaker 4>government what is now called wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 4>services,</v>

2366
02:20:23.690 --> 02:20:26.960
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this agency that was trying to solve the</v>

2367
02:20:26.961 --> 02:20:29.030
<v Speaker 4>Predator problem by exterminating caio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

2368
02:20:29.031 --> 02:20:34.031
<v Speaker 4>the reason they used our new chemical </v>
<v Speaker 4>insights during World War Two to come up</v>

2369
02:20:35.841 --> 02:20:36.674
<v Speaker 4>with new poisons a against coyotes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was that they began to realize that </v>

2370
02:20:41.451 --> 02:20:42.284
<v Speaker 4>strychnine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which had been the poison of preference </v>

2371
02:20:44.301 --> 02:20:45.134
<v Speaker 4>for the previous 70 or so years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a poison that kill coyotes too </v>

2372
02:20:50.781 --> 02:20:55.781
<v Speaker 4>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And coyotes are really smart about cause</v>

2373
02:20:55.791 --> 02:21:00.110
<v Speaker 4>and effect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so a coyote that was in the presence</v>

2374
02:21:00.111 --> 02:21:05.111
<v Speaker 4>of an animal that ate a bait cube and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then suddenly went into convulsions.</v>

2375
02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:06.943
<v Speaker 4>And strychnine produced these really </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of bizarre and grotesque deaths </v>

2376
02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:13.273
<v Speaker 4>that those animals would not take a </v>
<v Speaker 4>strict nine bait after they saw that </v>

2377
02:21:18.711 --> 02:21:23.711
<v Speaker 4>happen to one of their pack members.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so in the 19 forties,</v>

2378
02:21:24.921 --> 02:21:29.450
<v Speaker 4>we came up with three new poisons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2379
02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:34.180
<v Speaker 4>one of them was call a sodium.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2380
02:21:34.290 --> 02:21:36.860
<v Speaker 4>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sodium,</v>

2381
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:40.850
<v Speaker 4>a floor Acetate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is the one we now call 10 80,</v>

2382
02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:45.680
<v Speaker 4>and it was called 10 80 and it was used </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the next 19 that was in fact,</v>

2383
02:21:45.681 --> 02:21:47.900
<v Speaker 4>it's still used in limited application </v>
<v Speaker 4>today,</v>

2384
02:21:48.470 --> 02:21:53.470
<v Speaker 4>but it was a poison that was developed </v>
<v Speaker 4>after 1080 tries by this laboratory that</v>

2385
02:21:55.620 --> 02:21:56.453
<v Speaker 4>assists 19 20th specialized in </v>
<v Speaker 4>developing poisons to kill a wolves and </v>

2386
02:22:00.501 --> 02:22:01.334
<v Speaker 4>coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's called the eradication methods </v>

2387
02:22:04.191 --> 02:22:06.860
<v Speaker 4>laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So 10 80,</v>

2388
02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:08.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>another one,</v>

2389
02:22:08.480 --> 02:22:09.313
<v Speaker 4>sodium foul medium was a poison that </v>
<v Speaker 4>kill coyotes so slowly that they would </v>

2390
02:22:18.021 --> 02:22:22.940
<v Speaker 4>often survive for a week after they ate </v>
<v Speaker 4>the poison.</v>

2391
02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:28.320
<v Speaker 4>And in that week their pads would fall </v>
<v Speaker 4>off,</v>

2392
02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:34.040
<v Speaker 4>their hair would fall off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the village would come off their bodies.</v>

2393
02:22:34.830 --> 02:22:35.663
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's one story where a farmer in </v>

2394
02:22:38.970 --> 02:22:43.970
<v Speaker 4>Colorado found during the winter of </v>
<v Speaker 4>about 18 or 19,</v>

2395
02:22:44.071 --> 02:22:44.904
<v Speaker 4>47 or 48,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he found seven or eight coyotes in his </v>

2396
02:22:48.451 --> 02:22:52.830
<v Speaker 4>barn with no pads on their feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no hair on their bodies,</v>

2397
02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:55.830
<v Speaker 4>all huddled together trying to stay </v>
<v Speaker 4>warm.</v>

2398
02:22:55.831 --> 02:22:58.020
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he killed them with a pitch fork.</v>

2399
02:22:58.110 --> 02:22:58.943
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the reason we introduced these </v>

2400
02:23:02.341 --> 02:23:05.040
<v Speaker 4>poisons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and there was a third one too,</v>

2401
02:23:05.430 --> 02:23:07.890
<v Speaker 4>which was a cyanide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2402
02:23:08.460 --> 02:23:12.910
<v Speaker 4>basically the one that we call him 44 </v>
<v Speaker 4>now that are little cartridges that fire</v>

2403
02:23:12.911 --> 02:23:17.911
<v Speaker 4>assign I'd missed into their mouths is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because these poisons killed them slowly</v>

2404
02:23:18.811 --> 02:23:23.811
<v Speaker 4>enough that other coyote is witnessing </v>
<v Speaker 4>the victim taking the bite of the poison</v>

2405
02:23:27.211 --> 02:23:30.090
<v Speaker 4>bait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't put two and two together.</v>

2406
02:23:30.270 --> 02:23:31.710
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2407
02:23:31.770 --> 02:23:32.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we ha.</v>

2408
02:23:32.730 --> 02:23:37.730
<v Speaker 4>We even had these kinds of insights </v>
<v Speaker 4>about how animals will observe something</v>

2409
02:23:38.190 --> 02:23:39.023
<v Speaker 4>and preserve a memory of what they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>seen and then try to actually come up </v>

2410
02:23:43.980 --> 02:23:47.040
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a poison that plays against that.</v>

2411
02:23:48.060 --> 02:23:49.290
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely fascinating.</v>

2412
02:23:50.300 --> 02:23:51.360
<v Speaker 2>The whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole subject.</v>

2413
02:23:51.361 --> 02:23:52.830
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen man,</v>

2414
02:23:52.831 --> 02:23:53.664
<v Speaker 2>I'm so glad we got together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to get you together with Randall </v>

2415
02:23:56.410 --> 02:23:57.243
<v Speaker 2>Carlson though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you be interested in coming back </v>

2416
02:23:57.871 --> 02:23:59.580
<v Speaker 2>and doing another shot?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to do that.</v>

2417
02:23:59.610 --> 02:24:00.443
<v Speaker 2>I would great to have you get together </v>
<v Speaker 2>with him and compare notes because he </v>

2418
02:24:02.611 --> 02:24:03.444
<v Speaker 2>has some really interesting observations</v>
<v Speaker 2>about these asteroidal impacts and I </v>

2419
02:24:06.811 --> 02:24:09.960
<v Speaker 2>think the two of you together would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fascinating conversation.</v>

2420
02:24:09.961 --> 02:24:12.870
<v Speaker 2>So let's do that down the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But until then,</v>

2421
02:24:12.900 --> 02:24:15.480
<v Speaker 2>your book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coyote America is fantastic.</v>

2422
02:24:15.481 --> 02:24:17.910
<v Speaker 2>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you very much for that.</v>

2423
02:24:17.940 --> 02:24:20.190
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't started reading yet,</v>

2424
02:24:20.191 --> 02:24:21.870
<v Speaker 2>but American Serengeti is your other </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

2425
02:24:21.871 --> 02:24:24.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's equally awesome and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>really enjoyed this.</v>

2426
02:24:24.271 --> 02:24:25.770
<v Speaker 2>Thank you so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really appreciate it.</v>

2427
02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:26.791
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for having me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2428
02:24:26.791 --> 02:24:28.060
<v Speaker 2>It's been great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right folks.</v>
